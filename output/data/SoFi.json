      "# [Home Mortgage Calculator on 2017-02-28](https://www.sofi.com/mortgage-calculator/)\nWelcome to the SoFi mortgage payment calculator. Whether you have found your dream home or are wondering what your purchase budget should be — or already own a home and are considering a refinance — this calculator will help you determine what your monthly home loan payment will be and how much interest you’ll pay over the life of your loan. Let the number crunching begin.\n\nStep 1: Enter your property value.\n\nUse the value or listed price of your desired home or the current estimated value of the home you wish to refinance.\n\nStep 2: Enter a down payment amount or percent down\n\nEnter a down payment of at least 3%. If you’re considering a mortgage refinance, enter the amount of equity you currently have in your home (subtract the amount you owe on your current mortgage from your home’s estimated current value).\n\nEnter a down payment amount and the mortgage payment calculator will give you the percentage down, and vice versa. So you could also choose to enter a percent down to see what your down payment would need to be. Putting 20% down on a property will allow you to avoid paying private mortgage insurance (PMI), but many homebuyers put down less than 20%, especially if they qualify as first-time homebuyers.\n\nIf you think you will need to borrow more than $766,550 to purchase a home, you’re likely a candidate for a jumbo loan and a lender may require you to put down at least 10%. (Some pricier areas have higher minimums for jumbo loans — enter the zip code of the location you’re shopping in at Fannie Mae’s mapping tool to see the jumbo loan number for your area.)\n\nStep 3: Enter an interest rate.\n\nPlug in the day’s average fixed rate for a 15- or 30-year mortgage, or use the rate a lender has suggested you may qualify for.\n\nStep 4: Choose a loan term.\n\nThe term is the number of years the loan will last. The lower the term, the higher the monthly payment but the greater the savings in total interest paid.\n\nUnderstanding the Results\n\nThe calculator will immediately show the following results:\n\n• Loan amount: This is the amount you would borrow, also known as the principal.\n\n• Monthly payment: This is what you would pay toward the principal and interest each month. Remember that you will also need to pay for property taxes, homeowners insurance, and perhaps homeowners association (HOA) fees and private mortgage insurance (PMI). Some of these costs will be higher or lower depending on the cost of living in your area.\n\n• Total interest paid: This is the amount of interest paid over the life of the loan.\n\n• Payoff date: Here, the mortgage loan calculator shows the day you’d pay off your mortgage unless you refinanced or paid it off early.\n\n• Amortization chart: This chart shows interest paid, principal paid, and the remaining amount of the loan with each mortgage payment. Move your cursor to the right to see how payments are amortized over time. The amortization chart can also serve as a mortgage payment calculator: As you move your cursor you can see how much money would be required to pay off the principal you owe at different times during the loan. If you do want to pay off your mortgage, get the exact amount due from your lender.\n\nBenefits of Using a Mortgage Payment Calculator\n\nMortgages can be complicated, especially if you’re buying your first home, but there are many ways a mortgage payment calculator can help. Playing with different property values can give you a general idea of how a home’s price might impact your monthly payments and what a mortgage loan may cost in total over the life of the loan.\n\nIt’s also helpful to use a home mortgage calculator to compare the monthly payment for different types of mortgage loans (15- vs. 30-year terms). And it’s useful to see how sizing up (or trimming back) your down payment amount might affect your monthly costs. (If you think you might struggle to come up with any down payment at all, there are down payment assistance programs that can help.)\n\nThe only downside of using a mortgage calculator? As noted above, many mortgage calculators don’t include property taxes, homeowners insurance, mortgage insurance, or HOA fees — so they don’t provide a complete picture of the recurring expenses on a property. And of course the numbers you get from a mortgage calculator are only as solid as the numbers you put in: If you put in a low interest rate that you can’t qualify for because of steep debts or a shaky credit history, your actual results in the mortgage market will differ.\n\nFormula for Calculating a Mortgage Payment\n\nThe mathematical formula for a home mortgage calculator is pretty complicated, which is why this calculator is so handy. If you wanted to do the math by hand, your formula would look like the one below. In this example:\n\nM = Monthly mortgage payment\n\nP = Principal (the amount you borrow)\n\nR = Your base interest rate. (Use the base rate, not the APR.) You’ll divide this by 12 because the rate is an annual one and you are solving for a monthly payment amount.\n\nN = Number of payments in your loan term. A 15-year term, for example, would have 180 monthly payments.\n\nM = P [R(1 + R)ⁿ] / [(1 + R)ⁿ − 1]²\n\nDeciding How Much House You Can Afford\n\nUsing a mortgage calculator is one way to begin to get a handle on how much house you can afford. You can also use a home affordability calculator , which will take into account your annual income and debts to generate a maximum home price that would be within your budget.\n\nThere are also longstanding guidelines for homebuyers that can help you determine what you can afford. One is the 28/36 rule, which states that your total mortgage payment, including principal, interest, taxes, and insurance, should not exceed 28% of your gross income, and your mortgage payment plus any other debt payments should not exceed 36% of your gross income. To learn what your monthly limits would be under the 28/36 rule, simply multiply your monthly gross income by 0.28 and again by 0.36.\n\nRecommended: Average Monthly Expenses for One Person\n\nAdditionally, before you settle on a location, do your homework on the cost of living and mortgage rates. It might just surprise you.\n\nCurrent Mortgage Rates by State\n\nHow Lenders Decide How Much You Can Afford to Borrow\n\nThere’s another important calculation involved in the homebuying process: the number-crunching a prospective lender will do to determine the size of loan and terms you might qualify for. Each lender has its own formula, but in general a lender will be looking at your debt-to-income ratio, which is your total debt divided by your total income, shown as a percentage. (Generally, lenders are looking for 43% or less.)\n\nLenders will also examine your credit history, your income history, your down payment amount, and other factors to arrive at whether you are a good candidate for a loan and, if so, what terms you’ll be offered.\n\nWhat’s Next: Get Preapproved for a Mortgage Loan\n\nOnce you’ve used a mortgage calculator to estimate how much you might be able to pay for a house, you can get prequalified for a mortgage with a few lenders to obtain a clearer idea of what interest rate and loan amount a lender might offer you, based on a high-level look at your finances. As you get serious about home-shopping, you’ll want to take the next step and get preapproved for a mortgage with at least one lender.\n\nGoing through the mortgage preapproval process involves a thorough review of your credit and financial history. If you seem to be a good candidate for a home loan, the lender will give you a letter stating that you qualify for a loan of a certain amount and at a certain interest rate. The letter is an offer, but not a firm commitment. It’s typically good for up to 90 days. If you’re competing with other buyers in a hot market, being preapproved for financing will make you more attractive to sellers.\n\nRecommended: Best Affordable Places in the U.S.\n\nComponents of a Mortgage Payment\n\nPrincipal and interest are the foundation of a mortgage payment, and the amount of your monthly payment that goes to each of these expenses changes over the life of the loan, with more of the payment being applied to interest costs early in the life of the loan. As you make payments over the years, more money will gradually go toward paying down the principal.\n\nTypical Costs Included in a Mortgage Payment\n\nPrincipal and interest aren’t the whole story. Maybe you’ve heard of PITI, which stands for principal, interest, taxes, and insurance. Property taxes and homeowners insurance costs can often be rolled into mortgage payments. The money is held in an escrow account, and payments are then made by your mortgage servicer. You can decide whether taxes and insurance become part of your monthly mortgage payment when you choose your home mortgage loan.\n\nTips on Reducing Your Mortgage Payment\n\nAfter you’ve had your home loan for a while, you might be interested in lowering your mortgage payments. One way is to apply any bonus or windfall to the principal. Another option might be to refinance to a lower interest rate. Maybe rates have dropped or your credit score has improved significantly since you bought your home — in this case, a refinance might offer real savings. You can put a lower interest rate into a mortgage payment calculator to see how a refinance would affect your monthly payments and interest paid over the life of a new loan.\n\nAnother way to reduce your monthly payment: If your equity in the home has hit 20% of its original value (the value when you purchased it), you can write to request that your lender cancel PMI. As long as the property has held its value, you have kept current on your monthly payments, and there are no liens or additional mortgages on the home, your request should be granted.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nA mortgage payment calculator can give you an idea of what your monthly mortgage payments would look like based on how much you spend on a house, what size down payment you make, and what interest rate you obtain. It’s also a good way to see how much interest you would pay over the life of a loan. Getting prequalified for a home loan with one or more lenders will give you an even clearer idea. And obtaining a mortgage preapproval will tell you exactly how much you may qualify to borrow from a lender and what your monthly payments might be.\n\nLooking for an affordable option for a home mortgage loan? SoFi can help: We offer low down payments (as little as 3% - 5%*) with our competitive and flexible home mortgage loans. Plus, applying is extra convenient: It's online, with access to one-on-one help.\n\nSoFi Mortgages: simple, smart, and so affordable.\n\nView your rate\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is a mortgage payment?\n\nA borrower makes monthly payments, typically made up of principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and any private mortgage insurance required by the lender. With a fixed-rate mortgage, monthly payments stay the same, but the amount of each payment that is put toward principal vs. interest is divvied up differently over time. A mortgage loan calculator can show what monthly payments would be based on different loan types and interest rates.\n\nHow does my credit score affect my mortgage loan interest rate?\n\nThose with the highest scores get the lowest rates. Even a small increase in rate can make a big difference over the life of a loan.\n\nWhat is principal and interest on a mortgage loan?\n\nThe principal is the amount borrowed. The interest is the price paid for borrowing.\n\nHow much should I put down on a mortgage?\n\nTwenty percent down on a conventional loan is ideal, but most people are not able to come up with that much. Some conventional and government-backed loans allow for low down payments or none at all.\n\nShould I choose a 30-year or 15-year mortgage term?\n\nIf you can comfortably swing the payments on a 15-year mortgage and you have emergency and retirement savings, the shorter loan term could be a smart choice because the total savings in interest will be substantial.\n\nHow can I get a lower mortgage interest rate?\n\nAdvertised rates are often misleading, so shoppers beware. Many house hunters ask for loan estimates from several lenders after applying for a mortgage. Be sure to examine the details and compare apples to apples. There may be room to negotiate with a chosen lender. FHA, VA, and USDA loans may have lower rates than conventional loans (but they require either mortgage insurance or fees).\n\nHow much income do you need for a $400,000 mortgage?\n\nIt would take an annual income of about $130,000 to afford a $400,000 mortgage. If you have significant debts, you might need to earn more.\n\nCan I afford a $300K house on a $70K salary?\n\nOne rule of thumb is that your home’s cost should not be more than three times your annual income. So it would be difficult to cover the costs of a $300,000 house on a $70,000 salary — unless you are able to contribute a large down payment. Use a home affordability calculator to zero in on your personal budget number.\n\nWhat is a livable hourly wage?\n\nThe living wage in the United States is $25.02 per hour, or $104,077.70 per year (before taxes) for a household of two working adults and two kids, according to 2022 analysis from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Living Wage Calculator. This is a national average, and your personal number will depend on costs in your local area and your family size.\n\nYou Might Also Like",

The app is cluttered with articles and other things that are an eye sore however. I hope they give users the ability to disable that in the future. It’s really cluttered and cheapens the app. Gives you the feel of a prepaid card account app or something.",

I opened a new joint banking account with SoFi in September 2024 primarily because of a bonus they were offering and the rate of their high yield savings account. There bonus was tiered based on the amount of the direct deposits. We met the criteria for the higher bonus with the amount from our direct deposits. However, one of work deposits was not “coded” correctly and thus then did not meet criteria. After a saga of 7 phone calls and 2.5 months and providing multiple pay stubs documenting that my direct deposit was indeed from my work, they were unwilling to change correct their mistake and provide a good customer experience.",

I also have their credit card and utilize the relay service offered.\n\nIn 2 years I haven't had any major issues with them. \n\nPros:\n- Interest rate is competitive (I utilize a money market for a little more long term money, the cash in savings at SoFi is emergency funds).\n\n- Paycheck via direct deposit always on time (2 days early but sometimes was early as 6 days).\n\n- Customer service was super helpful for placing a long-term alert (traveling overseas for a few months). With that, received a few notifications to ensure it was me making the transaction, which is fine. Card worked in multiple countries with no issues minus the occasional fraud check stated. \n\n- Vaults is a solid idea. I like being able to visualize and setup with each paycheck to move amounts for items. I have it set for travel, insurance and taxes.\n\n- Relay is nice to put all my accounts together in one place to see my net worth.\n\n- I enjoyed the 1 year 3% cash back on the credit card, 2% after the promo. I use the SoFi card as our default fall back for anything that doesnt have a higher reward with another card.\n\nEDIT: - The Overdraft protection to pull from savings to checking is nice for auto payments. I keep all money in the savings to maximize interest.\n\n- Rewards are super easy to redeem and clearly spells out how much you will get and gives you options. I had no issues racking up a years worth (wanted to see how much we actually accumulated) and then requested a credit toward the credit card. Posted in 2 days against the card and reduced that month's auto payment amount.  \n\nCons:\n- the investment section is coming along but still well behind on options and features of bigger investment firms. The 2% IRA bonus is nice right now but compare rates of their funds if you are looking long term. \n\n- No physical branch. Obvious one but if you needed a cashier's check, you would need to wait. I'd suggest a local credit union for cash deposits and any in person needs. \n\n- Credit card payments take a day or two to reflect the balance removed from my SoFi bank account. Kind of annoying but I can live with it. \n\n- Personal checks take 4-5 days for funds to be available. Not a huge deal for me but I know some enjoy the instant availability other banks offer. \n\nOverall, it's been simple and easing using their services. As long as that system continues for me, I'll continue to use SoFi.\n\n### Comment ID l7j93kj with +1 score by [(Shot_Net_2457, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/l7j93kj/) (in reply to ID khdpanj):\nHey you \nIt’s been a while I hope you see this.

All my bills and credit card payments come straight out of the SoFi HYSA account.\n\nThis has worked out well for nearly a year, I get the benefit of the good APR on most of my money and it works out because SoFi allows unlimited transfers.

I like their vault system so I don’t have to actively track allocations of savings myself. \n\nI use Amex Gold and a Hilton honors card for my daily expenses and pass my bills through my Amex Platinum so I steadily gain points as I go about life.

There's nothing \\*wrong\\* with USAA's banking platform - solid bank, but not much in incentives to stay there. Interest rate sucks (like it does with most brick & mortars), no great features, etc.\n\nI checked Ally and then heard about SoFi. Overall, I was more impressed with SoFi's features vs. Ally. The big feature that made me switch was NOT the APY (which I think was 4% at the time) - it was their Vaults feature (Ally has something similar called \"Buckets\".)\n\nBasically, it lets you create sub-accounts inside of your savings account called Vaults. This lets you earmark your cash for a specific goal or purpose. I've wanted a feature like this for close to a decade. \n\nVaults, along with some slight modifications to my financial decisions, suddenly made managing my money significantly easier than it's ever been. \n\nBecause Vaults are inside the Savings account, they also qualify for the higher APY as well.\n\nIf you have overdraft protection, you need to keep money in your actual savings account, because it will not automatically pull money out of any of your Vaults to cover an overdraft. You can transfer money between any of your SoFi Checking, Savings or Vaults instantly, so it's quick and easy to use.\n\nYou also have a feature called Autopilot, which can automatically transfer money from an incoming direct deposit, and auto send to the account or Vault of your choice. Makes it very easy to save money towards goals without having to think about it.\n\nI've been extremely happy with their service and have been with them now for a little over half a year.\n\n## Comment ID khhx8ol with +3 score by [(Kravos76, Reddit, 2024-01-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/khhx8ol/) (in reply to ID 1944r8o):\nMy usage of this service was purely to store a profit from a home sale and let it sit for the high yield savings benefit (along with direct deposit of 200/mo) from my employer. \nFast forward to purchasing a new home many months later and needing to wire transfer from SoFi to the title company…\n\nCaution:  if you need to do any wire transfers  - NOT AN ACH - but a real wire transfer; it’s not easy.

Usually most the of the \"horror stories\" on here are from people fucking around, opening accounts, closing accounts, buying crypto, using referral links for bonuses, not really committing to the program.\n\n## Comment ID khgxg7g with +2 score by [(MikeLaBelle, Reddit, 2024-01-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/khgxg7g/) (in reply to ID 1944r8o):\nCurrent offer. \n\nIf you toss 5k or more in a SoFi HYS you receive 4.6% yield & if you sign up for a direct deposit they provide you with a bonus $300 at the 5k minimum for the deposit. \n\n4.6% Yield\n$300 = 6% from the $5000 money move \n\nSolid guarantee if you have 5k available to sit in a SoFi account.\n\n### Comment ID kidxzd0 with +1 score by [(BeStillKey, Reddit, 2024-01-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/kidxzd0/) (in reply to ID khgxg7g):\nYou have to accumulate that within a month from direct deposits  or directly deposit 5k for $300 bonus.

They’re similar in almost every way with a few exceptions. Sofi has a higher APY with 4.6% and Capital One is at 4.35%. Sofi has vaults and CO allows you to open up to 20 different savings accounts which is pretty much the same thing. You can invest through Sofi but not CO. Sofi allows you to track other bills and accounts with different banks CO doesn’t. SoFi requires direct deposit to get the higher APY but it’s not a requirement for CO. Things like cashier checks, Venmo and making big purchases like a big down payment for a car are just easier with CO. I’m not sure if these are available with Sofi yet. Both are fee free banking and anything that Sofi falls short on can be covered by Capital One. I suggest using both. And like the saying goes never keep all your eggs in one basket.\n\n## Comment ID khdlqlu with +4 score by [(NefariousnessHot9996, Reddit, 2024-01-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/khdlqlu/) (in reply to ID 1944r8o):\nI absolutely love SoFi. I put over $1000 er month in direct deposit to take advantage of all features including overdraft. You can literally direct deposit ANY amount to get 4.6% but you’ll need $1000 or more for overdraft. How do I use overdraft? I keep ZERO in checking and ANY amount that draws from checking gets pulled from savings. I love the 2% credit card. I love the points from the various activities. I love the vaults. I named a vault truck payment and my paid off truck payment amount automatically dumps in there when my deposit hits and earns the same 4.6%. I have a couple investments in SoFi invest simply to try it out. Transfer times are very quick and my amount limit to transfer is insanely high. Although I don’t know the exact number. ATM fees are zero when you use AllPoint ATM locations which you can find on the app. The only thing I will not do is mobile deposit because I have heard negative things have happened to people. I keep a local credit union to deposit any cash. I always recommend a local fee free bank in addition.

OK, say I put $60K into a savings account. At 4.6% APY, at the end of a calendar year I should have earned $2760 in interest made. If I divide that sum by 12, it amounts to $230 a month. Beginning after the first month after opening my account (my $60K's been in the savings account for 1 month already) would my $60,000 be up to $60,0230. And if I withdraw the $230 (move it over to checking), could I continue to do that every month? This of course assumes that the At 4.6% APY remains the same (SoFi says it's been stable for 2 years)\n\nI have contacted them directly and am waiting on a clear answer, but if anyone has real world experience regarding my subject, I'd love to hear it.\n\nThank You!\n\n## Comment ID khezrc3 with +1 score by [(Nuclear-Fat-Man, Reddit, 2024-01-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/khezrc3/) (in reply to ID 1944r8o):\nLook into Wealthfront, I use them and they’re great.

I've also had zero issues with their customer service - the few times I've actually needed to use it. They've always been professional, friendly and helpful. \n\nOne feature I always wanted (that I didn't know anyone offered until I started checking other banks out) is a \"sub account\" in the savings account - similar to SoFi's Vaults or Ally's Buckets. USAA doesn't offer it, and it seems like such a no-brainer of a feature to have - set aside money for different goals in the same account - see the total, but also see that your money is split up for different things - massive win for me.\n\nI've come to realize that as much as I like USAA for all their services, they're just falling behind. I would have never considered switching away from them for car insurance - been with them 23 years on my own policy, and before that with my parents. \n\nBut I see SoFi offers car insurance too, so hey, may as well get a quote, if nothing else. See if they really can beat a company I've had almost a 25 year history with.\n\nI'm keeping my USAA credit card - don't want to lose over a decade of history. Doesn't have great cash back, but it IS good for when I travel internationally. No FTF, good travel benefits like accident insurance, trip cancellation and a couple of other perks.\n\nBack to SoFi - I've been reading a lot of reviews, watching a lot of Youtube reviews...the only thing I think I \\*don't\\* know at this point - do they actually offer checks with the checking account? None of the Youtube reviews have mentioned it one way or another. I know we don't use checks much anymore, but I'd kind of like to at least have a book or two of them just in case.\n\nAbout to go check out their website, and probably sign up either tonight or in the morning.\n\n### Comment ID jqhxydt with +6 score by [(rebel_dean, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/14owun8/goodbye_usaa_hello_sofi/jqhxydt/) (in reply to ID jqh7wr6):\nSoFi has free checks.

For anyone who's on SoFi right now, are there any ways I could get around this (ie. is there a non-Plaid option to withdraw my money from SoFi)?\n\n\n\n## Comment ID iwaef3k with +5 score by [(VAer1, Reddit, 2022-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/yubr0b/transferring_money_between_sofi_another_external/iwaef3k/) (in reply to ID yubr0b):\nOf course you can transfer money between the two(SoFi checking and external bank account), all you have to do is: manually add the external account with routing number and account number, then verify two trial deposit.\n\nFor ACH transfer, I never set up with Plaid, I always set up with routing number/account number. My understand is: for plain set up (account username and password), if you have anything change (password change) or some website change, ACH transfer may not work, you may need to set up plain again. While routing number and account number setup is reliable for long term.\n\nBut you can use Plain to link external account to Relay Insight, it is for viewing external account balance/activities, not for ACH transfer. This has nothing to do with ACH transfer.\n\nFor ACH transfer, you will need to add it as external account, either by routing number/account number or by plain. I much prefer using routing number/account number.\n\n## Comment ID iw8muwk with +2 score by [(mistafoot, Reddit, 2022-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/yubr0b/transferring_money_between_sofi_another_external/iw8muwk/) (in reply to ID yubr0b):\nSofi uses plaid to link accounts, but I couldn’t ever get it to work so had to link my external account using invest.

Plaid is preferred, I think they allow greater same day funds availability. But you can add up to 2-3 accounts manually (I forget if it’s 2 or 3 manual links) (manual being account /RTN). To link an account manually, allow the plaid box to open and type “manually” - select cancel when your bank doesn’t come up. Follow the prompts to link an account manually. For me, sofi didn’t allow manual linking when the account was brand new.\n\nNote: please review the plaid privacy policy. They suck up ALL data from linked bank accounts.

Thanks for dropping by our sub for the first time. I'm happy to step in here and help.\r  \n\r  \nLet's first walk through the steps of how to add an account in Full View®. Please follow these steps after logging into Fidelity.com:\r  \n\r  \n1. Click \"Accounts & Trade\" and then \"Full View®\"\r  \n2. On the \"Full View®\" home page, click \"Organizer\" above the welcome message\r  \n3. From the \"Organizer\" page, click \"Accounts\" on the left side and click the blue \"Add Accounts\" button in the top right\r  \n4. Select \"I have an online login to this account\" to begin the search. You may have to try a few different keyword searches. If you find the proper connection, click it to start the connecting process.\r  \n\r  \nIf you do not see the correct institution available when attempting to connect an account, the alternative would be to add the card manually. To do so, go back to the \"Add Accounts\" page, but this time click \"I don't have an online login to this account.\" Follow the account set-up to complete the process.\r  \n\r  \nIf you decide to go this path, please know that your manual accounts must be updated by you. To perform a manual account update, use these steps:\r  \n\r  \n1. Starting on the \"Home\" page of Full View®, identify the manual account and click on it\r  \n2. On the \"Account\" page, click the \"Edit\" button\r  \n3. Make the appropriate changes, then click the blue \"Save\" button when finished\r  \n\r  \nYou can read more about linking a bank to Full View® by checking out the link below. \r  \n\r  \n[Full View®](https://www.fidelity.com/what-we-offer/planning)\r  \n\r  \nIf we can help with anything else, please let us know.

Fidelity could probably do something \"hacky\" to make sure customers can connect to SoFi. And SoFi should probably provide some mechanism for third-party aggregators to pull down their data without third-party aggregators (like Live View) having to store use credentials.\n\nI periodically post this feature request on the SoFi sub-reddit: https://old.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1bnixds/325_331_weekly_feedback_and_feature_request_thread/kx91u0e/\n\n## Comment ID kxe0d3o with +1 score by [(ajmatz, Reddit, 2024-03-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fidelityinvestments/comments/zqt7zc/how_to_link_sofi_to_fidelity_full_view/kxe0d3o/) (in reply to ID zqt7zc):\nWhen will Sofi be linked with Full View?\n\nThat's the only institution that's missing for me and majority of my transactions.

We do not have any updates on adding SoFi to Full View at this time.\n\nTo join the platform, our Full View vendor often collaborates with other third-party institutions. This usually requires them to switch on a feature in their system’s back-end that lets Full View collect and show the data. That said, it could be more complex depending on the back-end setup of the other institution, and we would not be able to comment on any other organization's systems and procedures.\n\nYou can also use the \"Feedback\" button on the right side of your screen on the Full View landing page to ask for certain organizations for our Full View team to consider. Every year, Fidelity evaluates these requests and includes new financial institutions in Full View.\n\nIf anything else comes up, whether that's feedback, website navigation assistance, or questions about anything else related to your Fidelity account, please let us know!\n\n#### Comment ID kz1srxs with +3 score by [(sanidinerun, Reddit, 2024-04-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fidelityinvestments/comments/zqt7zc/how_to_link_sofi_to_fidelity_full_view/kz1srxs/) (in reply to ID kxf2lvz):\nIt would be awesome if Fidelity could prioritize this.

In case your account gets locked or frozen for some reason, always have a local brick and mortar to fall back on.\n\nUSAA was my first online-only experience back in 2013, and I still have a local CU account with a couple of paychecks worth of funds, just in case, even with SoFi.\n\n### Comment ID kwig7n5 with +7 score by [(Jeff-IT, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1bnfz42/sofi_app/kwig7n5/) (in reply to ID kwhzrl0):\nIm in the same boat.

I use the Personal Capital tool for net worth tracking, and the amount that you hold in the SoFi vault is hidden when it reports your balance.  I have no idea why.  I end up making a separate entry   \n\n\nAlly Bank's savings account also has a vault system, but they call it buckets, there.  Currently, the account earns 0.5% interest.  Unfortunately, their checking accounts don't have the vault system and it's only 0.1% interest; however, moving money between checking and savings is pretty seamless, and you can turn on reserve management/overdraft protection if needed.     \n\n\nPlus, I like that you can automatically schedule transactions more easily than you can with SoFi, and, if you schedule transactions or deposits, you can direct that money directly into specific buckets.   Interest works differently, though, because you designate a single bucket (or Core Savings) to receive the interest you accrue.  \n\n\nTo be honest, I have accounts with both SoFi and Ally.  I use SoFi as my main account since I prefer their investment platform, and I use Ally as a secondary for emergency funds.  I've found that I have an easier time linking Ally with some other accounts more easily than SoFi, and I have not been able to use Zelle with SoFi.\n\n## Comment ID hud5l17 with +1 score by [(itsjustmd, Reddit, 2022-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/sdec61/alternative_banks_with_vaults/hud5l17/) (in reply to ID sdec61):\nI mean it's really not any more complicated lol.

I’m not a sofi user but I’m here because I got a text message from a legit-looking scam and wanted to confirm that that’s what it was in case someone was using my info to create an account.\n\nUnless you’re a cybersecurity expert and willing to sacrifice your quality of life for information security, profiles of your info already exist on the internet. Emails and IP texts are super cheap, so some phishing scams don’t care if your info was pulled from a specific company or service… they’ll just cast a wide net pretending that everyone is a customer, knowing that those who respond probably are customers. Then, even if they don’t successfully scam you, they’ll sell your packaged info to other scammers along with the information that you responded to or clicked on the initial attempt at contact. Other more targeted scam specialists will then use that purchased information to, (potentially in this case) target you with more sofi scams.\n\nThat’s how ‘leaks’ can appear to happen despite companies adamantly insisting they weren’t hacked. Sometimes it’s a real hack and the company is incompetent or lying, but often it’s a mass sale of fished data, in much the same way that aboveboard companies occasionally exchange legally obtained CRM sales data.\n\n## Comment ID jjtovmn with +6 score by [(divsandpremium50, Reddit, 2023-05-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/13f2o6e/almost_fell_for_sofi_scam/jjtovmn/) (in reply to ID 13f2o6e):\nMan they got me with this same thing, luckily I’m fine and sofi reimbursed me the charges.

Lots of scammers around here.\n\n### Comment ID jjusrxj with +1 score by [(Careful-Jelly-9857, Reddit, 2023-05-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/13f2o6e/almost_fell_for_sofi_scam/jjusrxj/) (in reply to ID jjtcmrj):\nYes, they are everywhere, same thing happened to me right here on r3ddit.

They even spoofed the number so it matched Chase’s 800 number on my caller id. I had a weird feeling about the guy calling, so I just told him it was a bad time, and that I would call Chase back in an hour. He was very insistent I stay on the phone with him, and that’s when I knew. I hung up, called Chase and they confirmed no one on their end had contacted me. I’m glad I avoided trouble, but the scam was so convincing, I almost believed it.\n\n## Comment ID jju2sx5 with +3 score by [(Mithrandurrr, Reddit, 2023-05-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/13f2o6e/almost_fell_for_sofi_scam/jju2sx5/) (in reply to ID 13f2o6e):\nBanks will not ask you for a full 16 digits\n\nIf it's sketchy, hang up and call the bank yourself. \n\nNEVER answer a message that something isn't fraud unless you're 1000% sure that you did it!\n\n## Comment ID jjt7p2b with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/13f2o6e/almost_fell_for_sofi_scam/jjt7p2b/) (in reply to ID 13f2o6e):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID jjt8jnm with +4 score by [(stevenshom42, Reddit, 2023-05-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/13f2o6e/almost_fell_for_sofi_scam/jjt8jnm/) (in reply to ID jjt7p2b):\nThe person sounded to be an African American lady and the second person in the fraud department sounded like an Indian Man.

There bonus was tiered based on the amount of the direct deposits. We met the criteria for the higher bonus with the amount from our direct deposits. However, one of work deposits was not “coded” correctly and thus then did not meet criteria. After a saga of 7 phone calls and 2.5 months and providing multiple pay stubs documenting that my direct deposit was indeed from my work, they were unwilling to change correct their mistake and provide a good customer experience.",

Regardless of what their code of conduct says, they will and they have allowed workplace bullying/harassment. In my experience I had a C suite leader belittle me and be demeaning throughout my tenure. Multiple times I had witnesses, and on more than 1 occasion they spoke to HR to place a complaint about his behavior. I also placed several complaints myself with my business partner. The feedback was always the same, he’s being coached. The behavior got so bad that it reached employee relations. Regardless of my evidence and witness accounts, the employee relations person stated: “I believe everything you’ve shared with me within the last 3 weeks. I am aware that this employee does have this history”. She even went and shared her own personal experience about this C suite leader. Yet, she concluded the investigation by stating that bullying isn’t illegal, and therefore they can’t do anything, and any disciplinary action cannot be shared. In an effort to protect myself, I recorded this conversation and also 5 team meetings/1-1’s with my Manager. I figured if HR wasn’t going to protect me, I needed to have this evidence for reference. He never took accountability for his actions, if anything, the investigation made things worse and I had to go back and share evidence of retaliation. The poor behavior by this leader was documented and witnessed by people team employees and across other departments. Yet nothing was ever done. The abuse continued. I’m no longer with SoFi. Yet, I will always remember how unfair I was treated and the hostile work environment brought on by this leader.\n\n“Facts do not seize to exist because they’re ignored.”",

You will always be just another number to them no matter how much they throw around and showcase their values. Prime example is the recent layoffs that happened. No warning and no real empathy given. The leader on the zoom was reading a script and they cut off access within minutes without any management reach out. \n\nTraining -Complete mess and have trainers who have not even done the actual job they are training on. So if you like being thrown it to fully do your job with a fraction of the knowledge needed to do it. This would be for you. \nThis company used to care but unfortunately you are just a number. \n\nThe other reviews about management are spot on.",

Any attempt to try and do real work or make things better is met with being shut down by management who, above all, don’t want to rock the boat or acknowledge anything that needs to change. Several functional leaders will not speak to each other. Workplace bullying is completely accepted. HR tells you it’s unacceptable but they don’t want to terminate someone despite piles of evidence. I spent more time trying to manage the toxicity in the organization than actually able to do the work I was interested and hired to do. Ultimately I was pushed out of the organization after a very long career of being an overachiever in every other place I’ve worked. If you want to do good work that helps customers and the company, this place won’t allow it.",

The program is rooted in our leveling guide, which each employee is evaluated against. We aim to create a consistently positive member experience with every interaction, and in order to do so, we set very specific metrics - all employees are provided and evaluated against. Every employee is held to the same set of metrics, and we strive to give everyone the training and tools they need to meet and exceed expectations. If you have any concerns about the process, we highly recommend you reach out to your People Business Partner (PBP) or your manager - who are here to support your career journey.

You will always be just another number to them no matter how much they throw around and showcase their values. Prime example is the recent layoffs that happened. No warning and no real empathy given. The leader on the zoom was reading a script and they cut off access within minutes without any management reach out. \n\nTraining -Complete mess and have trainers who have not even done the actual job they are training on.

Regardless of what their code of conduct says, they will and they have allowed workplace bullying/harassment. In my experience I had a C suite leader belittle me and be demeaning throughout my tenure. Multiple times I had witnesses, and on more than 1 occasion they spoke to HR to place a complaint about his behavior. I also placed several complaints myself with my business partner. The feedback was always the same, he’s being coached. The behavior got so bad that it reached employee relations. Regardless of my evidence and witness accounts, the employee relations person stated: “I believe everything you’ve shared with me within the last 3 weeks. I am aware that this employee does have this history”. She even went and shared her own personal experience about this C suite leader. Yet, she concluded the investigation by stating that bullying isn’t illegal, and therefore they can’t do anything, and any disciplinary action cannot be shared. In an effort to protect myself, I recorded this conversation and also 5 team meetings/1-1’s with my Manager. I figured if HR wasn’t going to protect me, I needed to have this evidence for reference. He never took accountability for his actions, if anything, the investigation made things worse and I had to go back and share evidence of retaliation. The poor behavior by this leader was documented and witnessed by people team employees and across other departments. Yet nothing was ever done. The abuse continued. I’m no longer with SoFi. Yet, I will always remember how unfair I was treated and the hostile work environment brought on by this leader.\n\n“Facts do not seize to exist because they’re ignored.”",

The festival, a celebration of creative minds, is set to take place Sept. 20-22 on Emory University’s Oxford College campus.\n\nThe group, comprising Sophie Hawley-Weld and Tucker Halpern, recently released their third studio album “BREAD.” An acronym for Be Really Energetic and Dance, “BREAD” encapsulates their infectious music, which spreads themes of liberation, unity and self-empowerment. The band has amassed more than three billion streams, earned platinum and gold records on five continents and been featured in several brand campaigns for Apple, Peloton and Smartwater.\n\nAs part of the festival, the duo will speak with Matt Whyte, host of the Sing for Science podcast, which connects musicians with scientists. SOFI TUKKER will chat about bread, the beloved food staple, and the chemistry that makes it so delicious with Maria Ortiz — the food scientist behind the popular Instagram account All You Knead is Bread — on Sunday, Sept. 22 at 4:30 p.m.\n\nHosted by Emory’s Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, the event — which is free and open to the public — also features live music, local food vendors, children’s programming and exhibits. Festival registration is open.\n\nSOFI TUKKER joins the previously announced keynote speaker, renowned rapper, producer and record executive Jermaine Dupri, and more than 40 other speakers at the festival, intended to connect students and the greater community with visionary scholars, creators and thought leaders, including a Pulitzer-winning journalist, transformative business executive, New York Times-bestselling music historian and innovative toy designer.\n\nDuring the festival’s keynote session Friday evening, Dupri, a Grammy Award winner, Atlanta native and founder of So So Def Recordings, will engage in conversation with Whyte and Joycelyn Wilson, assistant professor in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication at Georgia Tech. Through her work as an ethnographer, Wilson has traced the cultural forces that have shaped Atlanta’s unique identity as the thriving epicenter of hip hop and R&B.\n\nDelving into multiple themes\n\nAdditional speaker sessions on Saturday and Sunday will cover an array of themes including science, history, literature, entrepreneurship, music and cinematography and photography. The full schedule and speaker biographies are now available on the newly launched Ideas Festival Emory website.\n\nJust a few of the notable speakers include:\n\nBarbara Kopple, a two-time Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker;\n\nVirginia Willis, a James Beard award-winning cookbook author and chef;\n\nJon Goode, an Emmy-nominated writer whose work has been featured on CNN, HBO and BET;\n\nStephanie Stuckey, board chair of Stuckey’s, the candy manufacturer; and\n\nCarrie Buse, head of design for Mattel’s Future Lab, which focuses on innovative products and play experiences.\n\nThroughout the weekend, Ideas Festival Emory will feature live music and entertainment on the Oxford College quad, photography exhibits and food and drink vendors.\n\nThe event will also include children’s programming and collaborations with local schools. In partnership with the Newton Education Foundation, the Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement will host hundreds of students from Newton County Schools, providing them with a unique learning opportunity to connect with children’s book authors.\n\nThe festival has attracted sponsors committed to engaging individuals and families across the metro Atlanta region in its programming, including Lumina Foundation, WABE, the City of Covington and Rough Draft Atlanta.\n\nKen Carter, Charles Howard Candler Professor of Psychology and founding director of the Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, believes the festival — the center’s flagship event — will be distinctive in its mission to share ideas and spark curiosity with local and global audiences.\n\n“Ideas Festival Emory is a celebration of creativity and innovation, connecting the public with visionary leaders who inspire and challenge us,” says Carter. “We hope the festival will ignite new ideas and inspire meaningful conversations, in an environment that will be fun for people of all ages.”\n\nWhile attendees will engage with and learn from speakers during the sessions, Carter hopes the festival will have an impact that stretches beyond the three-day event. Speaker sessions will be recorded for an upcoming podcast that will help extend the festival's reach and attract curious listeners from around the world.\n\nThe Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, established in 2023, aims to help faculty and students proactively engage in public conversation and increase confidence in the value of scholarship and evidence-based research. With plans to expand its programming and host a Public Scholarship Academy for faculty in May 2025, the center — housed at Oxford College — hopes to establish itself as a novel space where scholars share knowledge and insights directly with the community.\n\n“I’m proud that Oxford College is home to the Emory Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, and we look forward to hosting this incredible weekend of exploration and discovery on our beautiful campus,” says Oxford Dean Badia Ahad.\n\n“Bringing together a diversity of scholars, artists and writers to discuss some of the most pressing and complex issues of our time is particularly important in this cultural moment when we need more and better models of civil discourse, free expression of ideas and constructive dialogue,” Ahad continues. “This perfectly captures the spirit of education and collaboration we embrace here at Oxford and Emory.”",

      "# [Launch Dates Confirmed for TGL presented by SoFi, Starting in Prime Time on ESPN](https://tglgolf.com/articles/2024/03/tgl-presented-by-sofi--coming-january-2025)\nMatches 1, 2 and 3 of the first TGL presented by SoFi season will all take place on Tuesdays in January and be live from SoFi Center. The first night of TGL action will be Tuesday, January 7th.\n\nThe full TGL schedule - including matchups - will be announced later this year.\n\nThe launch of TGL’s inaugural season will benefit from promotion during ESPN’s comprehensive coverage of the NFL Playoffs and new 12-team College Football Playoff. At this time of year, ESPN’s coverage includes TGL’s week 2 match on Tuesday, Jan 14, the night following ESPN’s Monday Night Football Wild Card Playoff game, and TGL’s week 3 match on Tuesday, Jan 21, the night following ESPN’s coverage of the College Football Playoff National Championship Game.\n\nESPN’s NFL Playoff game and College Football National Championship Game are traditionally the network’s most-watched games each year and drive January as the network’s most-watched month.\n\n“As we plan the 2025 launch of TGL presented by SoFi, we now have the first three Tuesdays in January circled to introduce sports fans to this new form of team golf. January is a tremendous time of year for fans looking for prime time sports and TGL’s launch will complement the start of the PGA TOUR season and take advantage of ESPN’s promotional machine across their coverage of the NFL and college football playoffs,” said Mike McCarley, founder and CEO of TMRW Sports.\n\n“We’re grateful for our tremendous partner SoFi, who shares in our vision to harness technology to create new approaches within traditional institutions. As construction proceeds on SoFi Center, we’re eager to introduce sports fans to TGL as we focus on the league’s debut this coming January.”\n\n“From our very first conversation, there’s been a natural alignment between TGL’s innovative, tech-forward approach to golf with SoFi’s similar approach to helping millions get their money right with our digital all-in-one banking and financial services platform,” said SoFi CEO Anthony Noto. “Investing in sports like our partnerships with the NFL and the NBA has proven unequivocally valuable, and we’re thrilled to be partnering with TMRW Sports to bring the SoFi Center and TGL to life.”\n\nAll the action will take place in the custom-built SoFi Center, a steel-supported structure located on the campus of Palm Beach State College in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. The six teams consist of the PGA TOUR's top talent who will compete in a 15-match regular season, plus semifinals and finals matches in the 250,000-square-foot venue.\n\nSoFi Center is an unprecedented, tech-infused arena for golf and will create an intimate and unique “greenside” experience for fans with 1,500 seats wrapping around TGL’s field of play, which is similar to the size of a football field at 97-yards long and 50-yards wide.\n\nTGL matches will start with teams teeing off from real grass tee boxes to play custom-designed, virtual holes projected onto a 64’x53’ screen, more than 24 times larger than a standard golf simulator screen (144 square feet, 16’x9’). Once teams are inside approximately 50 yards they will transition to live action and finish each hole within TGL’s GreenZone, a 22,475-square-foot short game complex that transforms between holes.\n\nThe GreenZone will use advanced technology to make each hole a unique challenge for the teams, including its 41-yard-wide turntable that rotates the green and three bunkers to change approach angles and using nearly 600 motorized actuators as part of Full Swing’s Virtual Green technology embedded under the synthetic putting surface to morph its topography.\n\nEvery shot will be broadcast live during TGL, with teams playing within a 40-second shot clock. All players will also be mic’d up to bring fans closer to the action with real-time strategy discussions.",

      "# [SoFi Connection getting closer by GumbyDammet on 2023-12-29](https://community.quicken.com/discussion/7944565/sofi-connection-getting-closer)\nI try to connect my Quicken to my SoFi accounts every once in a while and I've gotten some success today. It appears as though the checking and saving accounts are downloading transactions with a few twists and turns.\n\nWith my first attempt, I linked all of my accounts and only got transactions for my checking account. It loaded a long history of transactions which matched to a lot of the reconciled transactions in my register along with a lot of old transactions that did not match. One thing I did notice is that it screws up the opening balance when it downloads so make sure you check it before you connect your account. I deleted all of the old, downloaded transactions that were reconciled but didn't match and accepted the rest.\n\nSince I only got the checking account transactions, I deactivated the connections for my savings account and vaults and tried connecting them again. This time I got the savings transactions but nothing for the vaults. Repeated the process used for checking to get the savings account reconciled.\n\nFinally, I deactivated the connections to my vaults and tried connecting them but did not get any transactions for any of my vaults.\n\nThe great news is that it looks like we are finally going to be able to download our SoFi transactions into Quicken for Windows. The bad news is that it is not quite there yet. I'll post an update in a few days to see if I get new transactions.\n\nInteresting.\n\nI am new to Sofi over the last 2 weeks. Since setting up Savings/Checking/CC, I was able to set-up all accounts in Quicken with the \"Add Account\" and searching Sofi. It found all three and has been downloading new transactions on them all for the past 2 weeks as I've transferred money in and made some initial purchases on the CC.\n\nYesterday I created 2 vaults… today I saw the transactions come in via the savings account (one for a balance of the vault and another showing the transfer from the Savings into the vault. I then hit \"add account\" again, and sure enough the two vaults showed up as additional accounts to add into Quicken.\n\nAt least for me… everything is working as I would expect from any other institution. I saw that multiple people have had issues over the past few months, but so far its been smooth for me."
