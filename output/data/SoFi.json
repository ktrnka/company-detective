      "# [Home Mortgage Calculator on 2017-02-28](https://www.sofi.com/mortgage-calculator/)\nWelcome to the SoFi mortgage payment calculator. Let the number crunching begin.\n\nProperty Value\n\nEnter the value or listed price of your desired home.\n\nDown Payment\n\nEnter a down payment of at least 3%.\n\nPercent Down\n\nEntering a down payment amount will give you the percentage down, and vice versa. Putting 20% down on a property will allow you to escape paying private mortgage insurance (PMI), but there are other ways to avoid PMI.\n\nInterest Rate\n\nPlug in the day’s average fixed rate for a 15- or 30-year mortgage.\n\nLoan Term\n\nThe term is the number of years the loan will last. The lower the term, the higher the monthly payment but the greater the savings in total interest paid.\n\nUnderstanding the Results\n\n• Loan amount: the amount borrowed.\n\n• Monthly payment: the principal and interest. Add estimated taxes and insurance.\n\n• Total interest paid: the amount of interest paid over the life of the loan.\n\n• Payoff date: the day you’d pay off your mortgage unless you refinanced or paid it off early.\n\n• Amortization chart: shows interest paid, principal paid, and the remaining amount of the loan with each mortgage payment. Move your cursor to the right to see how payments are amortized over time.\n\nBenefits of Using a Mortgage Payment Calculator\n\nUnderstanding mortgage basics is important, but so is getting an idea of how much house you can afford and what any given mortgage loan may cost in total.\n\nComponents of a Mortgage Payment\n\nMaybe you’ve heard of PITI — principal, interest, taxes, and insurance. It’s the foundation of a mortgage payment. Add any PMI.\n\nTips on Reducing Your Mortgage Payment\n\nOnce you’ve had your home loan for a while, you might be interested in lowering your mortgage payments. One way is to apply any bonus or windfall to the principal.\n\nWhat’s Next: Get Preapproved for a Mortgage Loan\n\nA mortgage calculator can give you an idea of what you can afford. Getting prequalified will give you a clearer idea. Preapproval will tell you exactly how much you qualify to borrow from a lender.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is a mortgage payment?\n\nA borrower makes monthly payments made up of principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and any PMI toward the mortgage. With a fixed-rate mortgage, payments toward principal and interest stay the same, but the amounts put toward each are divvied up differently over time.\n\nHow does my credit score affect my mortgage loan interest rate?\n\nThose with the highest scores get the lowest rates. Even a small increase in rate can make a big difference over the life of a loan.\n\nWhat is principal and interest on a mortgage loan?\n\nThe principal is the amount borrowed. The interest is the price paid for borrowing.\n\nHow much should I put down on a mortgage?\n\nTwenty percent down on a conventional loan is ideal, but most people are not able to come up with that much. Some conventional and government-backed loans allow for low down payments or none at all.\n\nShould I choose a 30-year or 15-year mortgage term?\n\nThe payments on a 15-year mortgage will be much higher than on a 30-year loan, but the total savings in interest will be substantial. The interest rate for 15-year mortgages is also lower. If you can comfortably swing the payments on a 15-year mortgage and you have emergency and retirement savings, that could be a smart choice.\n\nHow can I get a lower mortgage interest rate?\n\nAdvertised rates are often misleading, so shopper beware. Many house hunters ask for loan estimates from several lenders after applying for a mortgage. Be sure to examine the details and compare apples to apples. There may be room to negotiate with a chosen lender. FHA, VA, and USDA loans may have lower rates than conventional loans (but they require either mortgage insurance or fees).",

They also called their bank, which verified that the transaction was legitimate. I then contacted SoFi to confirm the payment, but despite calling every single day for updates, I got nowhere—no one seemed to know what was going on.\n\nMeanwhile, my bills were due, and because of the restriction, I had no access to my money. Every time I reached out, all I heard was, “We’ll relay this to the internal team.” At this point, I’m not even sure such a team exists, because it shouldn’t take over a week to review a simple transaction and verify it with the necessary parties.\n\nThis entire experience has caused me significant financial and emotional distress, especially since I was already in a difficult situation due to my accident. The lack of urgency and care for my account makes me feel that unless I were a billionaire, I wouldn’t receive the level of service every account holder deserves.

Also let it be k own that you cannot use Zelle unless you have a direct deposit. Also something they don’t tell you and if they do it’s not easily findable information. 🫣",

Luckily this account is already connected to Sofi. However, the last 4 digits of the account number is different from what it should be. It seems that Sofi uses a ghost number instead of the real account number for “safety reasons”! When contacted the support, they told me the only way I can verify this is the account I need is to do test transfer with some small amount of money.\n\nIt seems pretty stupid to me to not showing numbers of the linked accounts. All the other banks I’m using all correctly show the account number. \n\nAny suggestions on checking the linked account status?\n\n## Comment ID kzw9rtj with +8 score by [(MzDrea26, Reddit, 2024-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1c5rhkr/sofi_changed_the_account_number_of_connected/kzw9rtj/) (in reply to ID 1c5rhkr):\nDepends on the bank, for security reasons some banks don’t display/share your actual account number when linked externally, it’s a protection feature, for sure I know Chase has a history of doing this\n\n### Comment ID l05i3vf with +1 score by [(zo3foxx, Reddit, 2024-04-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1c5rhkr/sofi_changed_the_account_number_of_connected/l05i3vf/) (in reply to ID kzw9rtj):\nYep was about to say Chase does this.

I also have their credit card and utilize the relay service offered.\n\nIn 2 years I haven't had any major issues with them. \n\nPros:\n- Interest rate is competitive (I utilize a money market for a little more long term money, the cash in savings at SoFi is emergency funds).\n\n- Paycheck via direct deposit always on time (2 days early but sometimes was early as 6 days).\n\n- Customer service was super helpful for placing a long-term alert (traveling overseas for a few months). With that, received a few notifications to ensure it was me making the transaction, which is fine. Card worked in multiple countries with no issues minus the occasional fraud check stated. \n\n- Vaults is a solid idea. I like being able to visualize and setup with each paycheck to move amounts for items. I have it set for travel, insurance and taxes.\n\n- Relay is nice to put all my accounts together in one place to see my net worth.\n\n- I enjoyed the 1 year 3% cash back on the credit card, 2% after the promo. I use the SoFi card as our default fall back for anything that doesnt have a higher reward with another card.\n\nEDIT: - The Overdraft protection to pull from savings to checking is nice for auto payments. I keep all money in the savings to maximize interest.\n\n- Rewards are super easy to redeem and clearly spells out how much you will get and gives you options. I had no issues racking up a years worth (wanted to see how much we actually accumulated) and then requested a credit toward the credit card. Posted in 2 days against the card and reduced that month's auto payment amount.  \n\nCons:\n- the investment section is coming along but still well behind on options and features of bigger investment firms. The 2% IRA bonus is nice right now but compare rates of their funds if you are looking long term. \n\n- No physical branch. Obvious one but if you needed a cashier's check, you would need to wait. I'd suggest a local credit union for cash deposits and any in person needs. \n\n- Credit card payments take a day or two to reflect the balance removed from my SoFi bank account. Kind of annoying but I can live with it. \n\n- Personal checks take 4-5 days for funds to be available. Not a huge deal for me but I know some enjoy the instant availability other banks offer. \n\nOverall, it's been simple and easing using their services. As long as that system continues for me, I'll continue to use SoFi.\n\n### Comment ID l7j93kj with +1 score by [(Shot_Net_2457, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/l7j93kj/) (in reply to ID khdpanj):\nHey you \nIt’s been a while I hope you see this.

I still use a checking account from a bank with a local in-person branch.\n\nI keep 90% of my funds in the HYSA, and run nearly all my spending through credit cards. Most of my direct deposit goes to SoFi with a small portion to the \"big bank\" checking account. All my bills and credit card payments come straight out of the SoFi HYSA account.\n\nThis has worked out well for nearly a year, I get the benefit of the good APR on most of my money and it works out because SoFi allows unlimited transfers.

I like their vault system so I don’t have to actively track allocations of savings myself. \n\nI use Amex Gold and a Hilton honors card for my daily expenses and pass my bills through my Amex Platinum so I steadily gain points as I go about life.

There's nothing \\*wrong\\* with USAA's banking platform - solid bank, but not much in incentives to stay there. Interest rate sucks (like it does with most brick & mortars), no great features, etc.\n\nI checked Ally and then heard about SoFi. Overall, I was more impressed with SoFi's features vs. Ally. The big feature that made me switch was NOT the APY (which I think was 4% at the time) - it was their Vaults feature (Ally has something similar called \"Buckets\".)\n\nBasically, it lets you create sub-accounts inside of your savings account called Vaults. This lets you earmark your cash for a specific goal or purpose. I've wanted a feature like this for close to a decade. \n\nVaults, along with some slight modifications to my financial decisions, suddenly made managing my money significantly easier than it's ever been. \n\nBecause Vaults are inside the Savings account, they also qualify for the higher APY as well.\n\nIf you have overdraft protection, you need to keep money in your actual savings account, because it will not automatically pull money out of any of your Vaults to cover an overdraft. You can transfer money between any of your SoFi Checking, Savings or Vaults instantly, so it's quick and easy to use.\n\nYou also have a feature called Autopilot, which can automatically transfer money from an incoming direct deposit, and auto send to the account or Vault of your choice. Makes it very easy to save money towards goals without having to think about it.\n\nI've been extremely happy with their service and have been with them now for a little over half a year.\n\n## Comment ID khhx8ol with +3 score by [(Kravos76, Reddit, 2024-01-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/khhx8ol/) (in reply to ID 1944r8o):\nMy usage of this service was purely to store a profit from a home sale and let it sit for the high yield savings benefit (along with direct deposit of 200/mo) from my employer. \nFast forward to purchasing a new home many months later and needing to wire transfer from SoFi to the title company…\n\nCaution:  if you need to do any wire transfers  - NOT AN ACH - but a real wire transfer; it’s not easy.

They’re similar in almost every way with a few exceptions. Sofi has a higher APY with 4.6% and Capital One is at 4.35%. Sofi has vaults and CO allows you to open up to 20 different savings accounts which is pretty much the same thing. You can invest through Sofi but not CO. Sofi allows you to track other bills and accounts with different banks CO doesn’t. SoFi requires direct deposit to get the higher APY but it’s not a requirement for CO. Things like cashier checks, Venmo and making big purchases like a big down payment for a car are just easier with CO. I’m not sure if these are available with Sofi yet.

I put over $1000 er month in direct deposit to take advantage of all features including overdraft. You can literally direct deposit ANY amount to get 4.6% but you’ll need $1000 or more for overdraft. How do I use overdraft? I keep ZERO in checking and ANY amount that draws from checking gets pulled from savings. I love the 2% credit card. I love the points from the various activities. I love the vaults. I named a vault truck payment and my paid off truck payment amount automatically dumps in there when my deposit hits and earns the same 4.6%. I have a couple investments in SoFi invest simply to try it out. Transfer times are very quick and my amount limit to transfer is insanely high. Although I don’t know the exact number. ATM fees are zero when you use AllPoint ATM locations which you can find on the app. The only thing I will not do is mobile deposit because I have heard negative things have happened to people.

Beginning after the first month after opening my account (my $60K's been in the savings account for 1 month already) would my $60,000 be up to $60,0230.

I have finally made the choice to switch to sofi as of a few weeks ago.\n\nhonestly I couldn't stand USAA anymore, I kept having issues with attempting to change an accounts address, not to mention horrible APY on my savings accounts\n\nsofi seems like to be a much better option, considering how high of an APY I get just for having direct deposit(which I hope clears for my new account, if my jobs direct deposit form worked correctly\n\n\n\n## Comment ID jqf166b with +15 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/14owun8/goodbye_usaa_hello_sofi/jqf166b/) (in reply to ID 14owun8):\nAbout to do the same thing. Been with USAA about 20 years. USAA was a lot like SoFi back then, a bit of a disruptor. Rates sucked,  but good service, nice benefits, cash back debit. It’s all gone now.\n\n## Comment ID jqh7wr6 with +8 score by [(Neuromancer2112, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/14owun8/goodbye_usaa_hello_sofi/jqh7wr6/) (in reply to ID 14owun8):\nHa wow...looks like I'm the next in line to switch over, but maybe not for exactly the same reasons.\n\nI've had zero issues with USAA as a bank - they're stable, dependable, and...boring. I've also had zero issues with their customer service - the few times I've actually needed to use it. They've always been professional, friendly and helpful. \n\nOne feature I always wanted (that I didn't know anyone offered until I started checking other banks out) is a \"sub account\" in the savings account - similar to SoFi's Vaults or Ally's Buckets. USAA doesn't offer it, and it seems like such a no-brainer of a feature to have - set aside money for different goals in the same account - see the total, but also see that your money is split up for different things - massive win for me.\n\nI've come to realize that as much as I like USAA for all their services, they're just falling behind. I would have never considered switching away from them for car insurance - been with them 23 years on my own policy, and before that with my parents. \n\nBut I see SoFi offers car insurance too, so hey, may as well get a quote, if nothing else. See if they really can beat a company I've had almost a 25 year history with.\n\nI'm keeping my USAA credit card - don't want to lose over a decade of history. Doesn't have great cash back, but it IS good for when I travel internationally. No FTF, good travel benefits like accident insurance, trip cancellation and a couple of other perks.\n\nBack to SoFi - I've been reading a lot of reviews, watching a lot of Youtube reviews...the only thing I think I \\*don't\\* know at this point - do they actually offer checks with the checking account? None of the Youtube reviews have mentioned it one way or another. I know we don't use checks much anymore, but I'd kind of like to at least have a book or two of them just in case.\n\nAbout to go check out their website, and probably sign up either tonight or in the morning.\n\n### Comment ID jqhxydt with +7 score by [(rebel_dean, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/14owun8/goodbye_usaa_hello_sofi/jqhxydt/) (in reply to ID jqh7wr6):\nSoFi has free checks.

Ordered the checks right after they set up my debit card for delivery. When I'm back at work on Wednesday, I'm gonna see if I can start the process of setting up direct deposit, but I may have to wait until I get my checks. Local government, and they're usually sticklers about having that physical blank check. I saw the auto completed form that SoFi offers, but my employer uses their own form...\n\nStarted setting up my other accounts through Plaid, and it's been pretty easy. I think I'm gonna enjoy the switch.\n\n## Comment ID jqggmlk with +5 score by [(mindyermanners, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/14owun8/goodbye_usaa_hello_sofi/jqggmlk/) (in reply to ID 14owun8):\nAbout to make the exact same move.

Thanks for dropping by our sub for the first time. I'm happy to step in here and help.\r  \n\r  \nLet's first walk through the steps of how to add an account in Full View®. Please follow these steps after logging into Fidelity.com:\r  \n\r  \n1. Click \"Accounts & Trade\" and then \"Full View®\"\r  \n2. On the \"Full View®\" home page, click \"Organizer\" above the welcome message\r  \n3. From the \"Organizer\" page, click \"Accounts\" on the left side and click the blue \"Add Accounts\" button in the top right\r  \n4. Select \"I have an online login to this account\" to begin the search. You may have to try a few different keyword searches. If you find the proper connection, click it to start the connecting process.\r  \n\r  \nIf you do not see the correct institution available when attempting to connect an account, the alternative would be to add the card manually. To do so, go back to the \"Add Accounts\" page, but this time click \"I don't have an online login to this account.\" Follow the account set-up to complete the process.\r  \n\r  \nIf you decide to go this path, please know that your manual accounts must be updated by you. To perform a manual account update, use these steps:\r  \n\r  \n1. Starting on the \"Home\" page of Full View®, identify the manual account and click on it\r  \n2. On the \"Account\" page, click the \"Edit\" button\r  \n3. Make the appropriate changes, then click the blue \"Save\" button when finished\r  \n\r  \nYou can read more about linking a bank to Full View® by checking out the link below. \r  \n\r  \n[Full View®](https://www.fidelity.com/what-we-offer/planning)\r  \n\r  \nIf we can help with anything else, please let us know.

My understand is: for plain set up (account username and password), if you have anything change (password change) or some website change, ACH transfer may not work, you may need to set up plain again. While routing number and account number setup is reliable for long term.\n\nBut you can use Plain to link external account to Relay Insight, it is for viewing external account balance/activities, not for ACH transfer. This has nothing to do with ACH transfer.\n\nFor ACH transfer, you will need to add it as external account, either by routing number/account number or by plain.

No issues though I havent used customer service yet. I have checks and vaults. I accidently overdrew my checking and it auto-pulled from savings (which was nice feature I didnt even know about as I was trying to keep low checking balance). APY applies to all the accounts/vaults. It does track your spending and home value and car value too if you want that, though I find its hard to find where this is on the app. If you do direct deposit from certain payors you get paid 2 days earlier (Wed instead of Friday). Sync to Monarch has been without any issue or hiccup since day one and the transactions come over pretty quickly.\n\n### Comment ID lxmytmk with +2 score by [(Youknowit2btrue, Reddit, 2024-11-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1gsd7ix/officially_migrating_to_sofi_anything_i_should/lxmytmk/) (in reply to ID lxhw7xi):\nThe auto pull from savings is a nice feature I use all the time.

Generally all the deposits and bank transfers are quick. The app is nice, but it does incentivize you to take out debt with all their other products. When you are Plus the extra interest and reward points are great. \n\nIf you get their credit card, they do not do CLI on them. So you are stuck with whatever the introductory offer is. Support isn’t bad, but they haven’t always solved my problem. Right now I have a transaction on my credit card that will not clear. I have called the vendor and bank. Both say the money is cleared but the hold will not go away. It’s almost been a month now. As I mentioned they just flat out tell me no they are not doing CLI on the credit cards on phone calls or in chat. \n\nThe Invest worked fine. I was able to transfer funds, buy stocks and things worked well. \n\nI can’t articulate my exact reasons for leaving, just something in my gut that says to go. I’ve read posts about fees starting to pop up for things like account inactivity, robo advisors, etc. i haven’t looked at their balance sheet lately, but they need to keep showing growth.

I think it is a little more intuitive than Fidelity for example. I only invested in VOO while I was using it so I can’t provide feedback on any complex portfolio management. Doesn’t sound like you’d be doing that either. \n\nI moved to Fidelity largely because of how much assets they manage over SoFi. I don’t think either is right or wrong when you are starting out. Your behavior and savings rate is far more important. \n\nThe only thing to remember is to get access to Plus you do need to have direct deposits going to SoFi. In a multi-\naccount structure you may have to move money around. \n\nWhat I personally did was used SoFi for everything and had a credit union for cash and check deposits. (I read a story where someone deposited a check with SoFi and they froze all their money and it scared me). I previously had multiple accounts and played to much mental math that has me spending more than I realized. That is what is leading to the simplification of my finances. I might not get as high of a return on my cash in a credit union, but the simplicity and returns on a money market account (through Fidelity) are worth the peace for me.\n\n## Comment ID lxdh6o8 with +2 score by [(Retire_Trade_3007, Reddit, 2024-11-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1gsd7ix/officially_migrating_to_sofi_anything_i_should/lxdh6o8/) (in reply to ID 1gsd7ix):\nLeave money in savings and turn on all the overdraft settings.  They use your savings as coverage as long as it’s not in a vault for overdraft protection.

I use the Personal Capital tool for net worth tracking, and the amount that you hold in the SoFi vault is hidden when it reports your balance.  I have no idea why.  I end up making a separate entry   \n\n\nAlly Bank's savings account also has a vault system, but they call it buckets, there.  Currently, the account earns 0.5% interest.  Unfortunately, their checking accounts don't have the vault system and it's only 0.1% interest; however, moving money between checking and savings is pretty seamless, and you can turn on reserve management/overdraft protection if needed.     \n\n\nPlus, I like that you can automatically schedule transactions more easily than you can with SoFi, and, if you schedule transactions or deposits, you can direct that money directly into specific buckets.   Interest works differently, though, because you designate a single bucket (or Core Savings) to receive the interest you accrue.  \n\n\nTo be honest, I have accounts with both SoFi and Ally.  I use SoFi as my main account since I prefer their investment platform, and I use Ally as a secondary for emergency funds.

      "# Post ID 1fcphqp: Alternatives to SoFi?  with +14 score by [(fishpocketz, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1fcphqp/alternatives_to_sofi/)\nI’ve truly been SoFi’s #1 soldier for years and years at this point, but I am consistently running into bizarre issues with my banking that SoFi seems to always be the weakest link in. I’ve been hunting down my measly ‘23 tax return since January, with about a dozen calls to the IRS, multiple traces, etc. I’ve been repeatedly told this is on SoFi, and when I called their customer service over using their live chat, I was screamed at by the associate insisting it wasn’t sofi’s fault. \n\nI’m currently 3ish weeks into a sizable-to-me balance transfer away from my SoFi card to Discover, all of which went smoothly— except for SoFi not registering the balance transfer as completed, leading me to now be that amount *more* in debt, and it considerably crushing my credit score. I’ve initiated a trace with SoFi, again, but im really not optimistic. I’m only a couple of weeks into this process, and discover is my next contact. \n\nI’m just honestly very very tired with this. I have a very simple income, one source, direct deposit, one tax form, etc, truly nothing fancy. No stocks, a couple credit cards that I have 100% payments on and manage decently well. These things shouldn’t be happening to me constantly. \n\nI adore the product, but SoFi is consistently coming up the weakest link when I have issues. Is there anything similar? I know I can’t really get that APY many other places that *arent* HYSA, but there has to be something. I adore Relay, I adore and see a ton of productive use out of Vaults, I adore my 3% credit card, and I really do love the customer service availability. Surely by now someone has to have emulated this elsewhere for a simple checking and (ideally) vaulted savings? \n\nAll input is genuinely appreciated here. Thanks!\n\n## Comment ID lma5x1x with +18 score by [(NefariousnessHot9996, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1fcphqp/alternatives_to_sofi/lma5x1x/) (in reply to ID 1fcphqp):\nWealthfront\n\n### Comment ID m9y2mgk with +1 score by [(UrBoiJash, Reddit, 2025-01-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1fcphqp/alternatives_to_sofi/m9y2mgk/) (in reply to ID lma5x1x):\nNo joint checking features means it’s no good for me\n\n#### Comment ID m9y4jra with +1 score by [(NefariousnessHot9996, Reddit, 2025-01-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1fcphqp/alternatives_to_sofi/m9y4jra/) (in reply to ID m9y2mgk):\nYea.

While the APR on CapitalOne’s savings account is slightly lower (currently 4.25% vs. 4.5% with SoFi), it’s a more established bank with modern technology that rivals SoFi’s.\n\nUS Bank could be another viable option, offering up to 4.1% on savings (though this requires a $25K+ balance).\n\nYou might also consider the BofA + Merrill Edge combo. While BofA doesn’t have great savings account rates, you could invest in TTTXX through Merrill Edge and potentially earn 5%+ with the added benefit of state and local tax savings. The downside is that it requires manual management, as you’ll need to handle fund purchases and sales yourself, and there’s no overdraft protection.\n\n### Comment ID lmay1vl with +1 score by [(igcetra, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1fcphqp/alternatives_to_sofi/lmay1vl/) (in reply to ID lmawkh7):\nAre there fees to Cap1?\n\n#### Comment ID lmbbsgm with +4 score by [(TheSan92, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1fcphqp/alternatives_to_sofi/lmbbsgm/) (in reply to ID lmay1vl):\nNo, in fact, since Covid they don't even have the per month limitations on savings to checking transfers that some banks still apply (usually like 6 per month).  So you're able to transfer money back and forth between checking and savings as necessary.\n\nWhile they don't have buckets or vaults for savings, it's like a 10 second process to open additional (easily nicknamed) savings accounts (up to 25), since it's all pre-filled as a current customer.\n\nThe current rate on savings accounts is 4.25%, and there's no direct deposit requirement or minimums or anything of that nature on their checking (the checking rate, however, is only .10%).  You can have your payroll check direct deposited to checking and setup auto transfers to immediately send to one or more savings accounts as you wish.  \n\nAlso to note, while Cap1 doesn't have branches everywhere, they do at least exist if you need them.  They also have cafes in several larger cities with banking abilities.  The other useful part is that you can deposit cash easily (if needed) and FREE at Walgreens, CVS and Duane Reade by just giving a deposit barcode from your app to an associate (up to $999 5 times a month).  Most Allpoint ATMs (once again, at Walgreens/CVS/Duane Reade) also allow cash deposits at their ATMs as well, and obviously ATM withdrawals are free there (and thousands of other places) as well.\n\nFinally, even if you have multiple checking/savings accounts, it's all on one consolidated statement (broken down by account) at the end of the month.  Oh, and if you need it, Zelle exists (and always works too).\n\n#### Comment ID lmazdnk with +1 score by [(odin888, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1fcphqp/alternatives_to_sofi/lmazdnk/) (in reply to ID lmay1vl):\nNo fees or minimal balance requirements\n\n## Comment ID lma15i2 with +12 score by [(altboyjunkie, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1fcphqp/alternatives_to_sofi/lma15i2/) (in reply to ID 1fcphqp):\ni recently transferred from SoFi to Fidelity.

I absolutely love SoFi’s rates and their app is fairly intuitive if you’ve got sight (I’m blind for reference and some things do not work), but the push notifications are fantastic. Ally is on par with SoFi as far as the accounts go. Buckets are the same as vaults although you do not need a checking account to get a savings account as you do with SoFi. Capital One is solid as well. Their app is sleek and modern. It doesn’t have as many savings tools as SoFi or Ally but definitely a solid contender if you’re looking for alternatives. I also forgot to mention that ally did not provide early deposit for my paycheck as the other 2 did although your experience may differ. Just my thoughts.

I know there are services like Mint (now defunct) and Monarch - and I might look to incorporate one of those eventually.  But I was kind of trying to get a sense of how good the out-of-the-box capabilities are on the SoFi platform before moving all of our banking over there.  Maybe someone here can help?\n\nA year or so ago, I had played around with an app called LunchMoney.  It was actually really powerful in terms of building a sort of \"rules engine\" on really categorizing what your costs were.  So, for example, that $9.99 charge from the Apple App store around the 10th of the month, you could classify that as your Netflix account and put it into a specific \"Video Streaming Services\" category you define.  But then another $9.99 subscription that also hits from the Apple App store on the 20th might be your subscription to AllTrails or something like that so you'd have the rule categorize that one as \"Health and Fitness\" or something.\n\nSame vendor, same price point - but because the dates are different ... you could categorize it differently.\n\nSoFi doesn't have to be that powerful for it to be helpful, but I'd love to get an overview as to how powerful it really is and what you do with it?

I transfer between multiple accounts, including SoFi, to pay rent and pay various credit cards. I also receive money from Venmo monthly. Amidst these factors, it completely misunderstands my transfers and payments, showing negative thousands of dollars per month in “cash flow”. This is despite having all of my accounts and cards linked so that SoFi can see the activity. I may be able to salvage it if I were to manually go in and categorize every single transfer/payment myself, but I will not be doing that.

Every time I reached out, all I heard was, “We’ll relay this to the internal team.” At this point, I’m not even sure such a team exists, because it shouldn’t take over a week to review a simple transaction and verify it with the necessary parties.\n\nThis entire experience has caused me significant financial and emotional distress, especially since I was already in a difficult situation due to my accident. The lack of urgency and care for my account makes me feel that unless I were a billionaire, I wouldn’t receive the level of service every account holder deserves. Once this issue is resolved, I will be closing my account, as this situation has not only disrupted my finances but has made my life significantly worse. Given the damages I’ve suffered, I am seriously considering legal action.",

I could describe the issues but the list just keeps growing I don’t even know where to start. The app and some issues via a browser make the UX a terrible experience. I will dare name one issue. Where did my personal loan accounts go? They were there yesterday! I never updated the app. I didn’t update Where did it go? I want to make a payment I can’t. The account is not there. Two FA it worked in the beginning for a few days never worked again. I use two FA for everything several dozen accounts. That work flawlessly. Support meanwhile asking me to do the equivalent of push ups. Which I like to do.",

Every time I log in, I’m bombarded with pushy promotions for their other services. It’s like they’re more focused on upselling than providing a reliable banking experience.\n\nThe real frustration, though, comes from the app’s inability to handle basic banking functions. Every check I’ve written has been rejected for unclear reasons. When I reached out to customer support, they were shockingly clueless about how checks even work. It’s as if the team has no understanding of standard banking practices or how to address issues effectively.\n\nOverall, SoFi might work for someone who doesn’t need traditional banking services, but for anyone who expects a functional app and competent support, stay far away. There are far better options out there.",

          "advice": "*Criticisms aside, I think management is doing a great job, overall.\n\n1. I understand employee engagement and satisfaction is most easily measured by surveys and survey participation, but insisting everyone participates in an \"optional\" survey tells you less, and worse, potentially tells you the wrong things. You'll receive junk responses that have to be sifted through resulting in wasted staff hours, and many will be indistinguishable from honest feedback, simply for appearances. There will also be false positive answers from people who don't want to actually engage with the task; all ratings 5/5 with no substance. Additionally, measuring how many people fail to participate is *also* a key metric for employee engagement and satisfaction. More or less demanding feedback doesn't work in your favor.\n\n2. Please reassess how you reassess non-exempt wages. I know we have someone monitoring fair market wages in all locations, and while I can't speak for others, I don't feel like it's worked for me. I'm being forced by economic pressure into looking for openings with other companies that might compensate me more generously, and I don't want to. I really don't want to. I absolutely love working at SoFi, but my hand is being forced, and I don't think I'll be able to resist the financial tide much longer.\n\n3. Though the 2 hours paid self-guided training is very much appreciated, it is not enough to make any new knowledge really stick. This can be overcome by employees continuing these courses off the clock, which is fine, but without setting that expectation, I do not believe the company is getting a good ROI. I believe that either providing slightly more paid hours more frequently or specifically encouraging employees to finish courses outside scheduled hours will lead to better outcomes. In either case, a low cost incentive for completed courses might be a good idea, but particularly in the latter.",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "1. Feedback is valued so much that it's practically compulsory. I don't always have something to say, but I feel more or less forced to think of something for the quarterly surveys, even if its relatively inconsequential.\n\n2. Average cost of living in my city has outpaced my wages by ~6% over the last 4 years, while my rent alone has gone up ~11.67% while remaining below the median.\n\n3. Slow downsizing followed by COVID resulted in the closure of the CA operations office. Although this means I'm now fully remote (which is nice), advancement opportunities are significantly limited by location requirements, which is discouraging. This could be a factor for new hires who are fully remote.\n\n4. Rapidly increased outsourcing of lower operations roles, particularly customer service. The company insists onshore jobs are secure, but it's very hard to trust that completely.\n\n5. In spite of a focus on employee development, additional training in my role has been sparse. There are very good reasons for this, not the least of which is upheaval caused by promoting from within (which is a good thing overall). However, it is still an opportunity for improvement.\n\n6. No 401k match, and I haven't received RSU's since my original grant when hired, all of which vested years ago. This is probably not true for employees outside support roles, but I don't really know.",

          "pros": "1. Feedback is valued so much that it's practically compulsory.\n\n2. Company \"lives\" by its core values. They don't feel like hollow ideals we never deliver on. My favorite is: \"Do the right thing. If you’re not sure, do the harder thing.\"\n\n3. Surprisingly less evil than most finance companies, with a focus on member success. When I was in a customer \"facing\" role, I always felt like advocating for the consumer was both welcome and desired.\n\n4. In the last few years, the company has shifted to a strong emphasis on employee development and internal promotion. I have two hours of paid time per month to work on external skills training (formerly Udemy, now through LinkedIn).\n\n5. CEO has placed a focus on developing excellent corporate culture from day one (early 2018).\n\n6. Medical benefits are above average. Other myriad benefits are available with varying cost reductions, but the free Gympass (now Wellhub) membership and discounts for family members are a nice bonus.\n\n7. DEI is strong in multiple ways. SoFi accommodated my disability with no fuss or pushback, and there was no underhanded reprisal like being flagged as a \"problem employee\" who needs to be \"managed out of the business\" with excessive criticism and documentation of every possible perceived failure. *I cannot emphasize enough how valuable that is.\n\n8. Depending on your location and role, many positions are fully remote or on a 2:3 hybrid, including low level operations employees.\n\n9. Unless in a rigidly scheduled role, like customer \"facing\" roles, schedules are very flexible when needed. I've split my shift for a medical appointment on several occasions.\n\n10. Good amount of PTO for hourly employees with modest increases every year to year 6 (I believe). Exempt (salaried) employees have essentially unlimited PTO within reason, as long as business continuity is maintained.\n\n11. SoFi recognizes that good ideas come from all levels. First hand insight is valued, and appropriately escalated to stakeholders. That's not true for many companies, where lower tier employees are essentially told to leave thinking to the almighty middle management.",

You will always be just another number to them no matter how much they throw around and showcase their values. Prime example is the recent layoffs that happened. No warning and no real empathy given. The leader on the zoom was reading a script and they cut off access within minutes without any management reach out. \n\nTraining -Complete mess and have trainers who have not even done the actual job they are training on. So if you like being thrown it to fully do your job with a fraction of the knowledge needed to do it. This would be for you. \nThis company used to care but unfortunately you are just a number. \n\nThe other reviews about management are spot on.",

The program is rooted in our leveling guide, which each employee is evaluated against. We aim to create a consistently positive member experience with every interaction, and in order to do so, we set very specific metrics - all employees are provided and evaluated against. Every employee is held to the same set of metrics, and we strive to give everyone the training and tools they need to meet and exceed expectations. If you have any concerns about the process, we highly recommend you reach out to your People Business Partner (PBP) or your manager - who are here to support your career journey.

I regularly had to make calls that I knew were bad because we weren’t allowed time to properly do research. The company wouldn’t even pay for a backup IP search tool and we were stuck using whatever we could find on the internet. In the last year, SoFi seemed to be moving backwards in terms of progress and job quality. Not forwards. RTO, removal of development opportunities, lower raises, downsizing, etc all makes the company seem less like a FinTech and more like it was trying to be a bank. Which it didn’t know how to do yet.",

You will always be just another number to them no matter how much they throw around and showcase their values. Prime example is the recent layoffs that happened. No warning and no real empathy given. The leader on the zoom was reading a script and they cut off access within minutes without any management reach out. \n\nTraining -Complete mess and have trainers who have not even done the actual job they are training on. So if you like being thrown it to fully do your job with a fraction of the knowledge needed to do it. This would be for you. \nThis company used to care but unfortunately you are just a number. \n\nThe other reviews about management are spot on.",

The engineering primitives and infrastructure that would make it possible to build interesting things quickly and reliably either doesn’t exist or is so minimally invested in that each project tends to need to whip together its own basics in the tiny window of time before the next “extremely important” project is shoved on a group’s plate by various independent areas of leadership that don't understand what’s taking so long.",

Completely unrealistic production standards that can only be met by sacrificing quality which costs millions of dollars and allows for ID theft. I regularly had to make calls that I knew were bad because we weren’t allowed time to properly do research. The company wouldn’t even pay for a backup IP search tool and we were stuck using whatever we could find on the internet.

        "advice": "*Criticisms aside, I think management is doing a great job, overall.\n\n1. I understand employee engagement and satisfaction is most easily measured by surveys and survey participation, but insisting everyone participates in an \"optional\" survey tells you less, and worse, potentially tells you the wrong things. You'll receive junk responses that have to be sifted through resulting in wasted staff hours, and many will be indistinguishable from honest feedback, simply for appearances. There will also be false positive answers from people who don't want to actually engage with the task; all ratings 5/5 with no substance. Additionally, measuring how many people fail to participate is *also* a key metric for employee engagement and satisfaction. More or less demanding feedback doesn't work in your favor.\n\n2. Please reassess how you reassess non-exempt wages. I know we have someone monitoring fair market wages in all locations, and while I can't speak for others, I don't feel like it's worked for me. I'm being forced by economic pressure into looking for openings with other companies that might compensate me more generously, and I don't want to. I really don't want to. I absolutely love working at SoFi, but my hand is being forced, and I don't think I'll be able to resist the financial tide much longer.\n\n3. Though the 2 hours paid self-guided training is very much appreciated, it is not enough to make any new knowledge really stick. This can be overcome by employees continuing these courses off the clock, which is fine, but without setting that expectation, I do not believe the company is getting a good ROI. I believe that either providing slightly more paid hours more frequently or specifically encouraging employees to finish courses outside scheduled hours will lead to better outcomes. In either case, a low cost incentive for completed courses might be a good idea, but particularly in the latter.",
        "cons": "1. Feedback is valued so much that it's practically compulsory. I don't always have something to say, but I feel more or less forced to think of something for the quarterly surveys, even if its relatively inconsequential.\n\n2. Average cost of living in my city has outpaced my wages by ~6% over the last 4 years, while my rent alone has gone up ~11.67% while remaining below the median.\n\n3. Slow downsizing followed by COVID resulted in the closure of the CA operations office. Although this means I'm now fully remote (which is nice), advancement opportunities are significantly limited by location requirements, which is discouraging. This could be a factor for new hires who are fully remote.\n\n4. Rapidly increased outsourcing of lower operations roles, particularly customer service. The company insists onshore jobs are secure, but it's very hard to trust that completely.\n\n5. In spite of a focus on employee development, additional training in my role has been sparse. There are very good reasons for this, not the least of which is upheaval caused by promoting from within (which is a good thing overall). However, it is still an opportunity for improvement.\n\n6. No 401k match, and I haven't received RSU's since my original grant when hired, all of which vested years ago. This is probably not true for employees outside support roles, but I don't really know.",
        "lengthOfEmployment": 6,
        "pros": "1. Feedback is valued so much that it's practically compulsory.\n\n2. Company \"lives\" by its core values. They don't feel like hollow ideals we never deliver on. My favorite is: \"Do the right thing. If you’re not sure, do the harder thing.\"\n\n3. Surprisingly less evil than most finance companies, with a focus on member success. When I was in a customer \"facing\" role, I always felt like advocating for the consumer was both welcome and desired.\n\n4. In the last few years, the company has shifted to a strong emphasis on employee development and internal promotion. I have two hours of paid time per month to work on external skills training (formerly Udemy, now through LinkedIn).\n\n5. CEO has placed a focus on developing excellent corporate culture from day one (early 2018).\n\n6. Medical benefits are above average. Other myriad benefits are available with varying cost reductions, but the free Gympass (now Wellhub) membership and discounts for family members are a nice bonus.\n\n7. DEI is strong in multiple ways. SoFi accommodated my disability with no fuss or pushback, and there was no underhanded reprisal like being flagged as a \"problem employee\" who needs to be \"managed out of the business\" with excessive criticism and documentation of every possible perceived failure. *I cannot emphasize enough how valuable that is.\n\n8. Depending on your location and role, many positions are fully remote or on a 2:3 hybrid, including low level operations employees.\n\n9. Unless in a rigidly scheduled role, like customer \"facing\" roles, schedules are very flexible when needed. I've split my shift for a medical appointment on several occasions.\n\n10. Good amount of PTO for hourly employees with modest increases every year to year 6 (I believe). Exempt (salaried) employees have essentially unlimited PTO within reason, as long as business continuity is maintained.\n\n11. SoFi recognizes that good ideas come from all levels. First hand insight is valued, and appropriately escalated to stakeholders. That's not true for many companies, where lower tier employees are essentially told to leave thinking to the almighty middle management.",

Only one referral reward and one welcome bonus per new customer, with the exception of referrals for new closed end unsecured installment loans. You will not receive multiple referral bonuses for the same friend taking advantage of multiple promotions, nor will your friend receive multiple welcome bonuses for taking advantage of multiple promotions unless they are for a new closed end unsecured installment loan that your friend has not previously obtained. You will receive an additional referral bonus for the same friend funding a new personal loan, new student loan refinance or new private student loan, provided the friend applies through the specific product’s referral link and has not previously obtained that type of closed end unsecured lending product. Employees of Social Finance, LLC and its affiliates are not eligible to receive referral bonuses under the Referral Programs.\n\nEach person referred should be someone you have a direct, personal relationship with. You may not distribute a Referral Link or otherwise solicit anyone through mass email, any form of commercial advertising or other similar means.\n\nSoFi reserves the right to review, investigate, and disqualify anyone from participation in the SoFi Referral Program at any time, and reserves the right to not honor any referral which in our sole discretion was solicited in a manner inconsistent with the spirit or terms and conditions of the SoFi Referral Program.\n\nFurthermore, SoFi Securities reserves the right to seek reimbursement from any customer (including by deduction from their Invest Account) of amounts paid as Referral Bonuses to customers solicited via mass solicitation. Please note that in certain circumstances the deduction of such amounts from their account may result in a negative balance.\n\nAny person referred to a SoFi loan or SoFi Checking or Savings account may not have an existing registered SoFi account. Any person referred to Credit Score Monitoring may not currently have another SoFi product but may already have a registered SoFi account. A person referred to a SoFi Invest account may have an existing SoFi account.\n\nIf account funding is required to meet referral bonus payout eligibility, P2P transfers or proceeds of a reward, promotion or similar program are not eligible methods of funding.\n\nTo protect the privacy of those you refer, referral prospect account information or eligibility is not, under any circumstances, permitted to be shared with referral promoters.\n\nReferral Program — Part I\n\nLoan Referral Program\n\nThe terms below and those set forth in Part II govern your participation in SoFi Bank, N.A.’s (“SoFi Bank”) Loan Referral Program (the “Loan Referral Program“) described below. The Loan Referral Program is open to any consumer who registers on SoFi’s website and who resides outside of the state of Vermont (the “Eligible Loan Referrer(s)“). Employees of Social Finance, LLC and its affiliates are not eligible to receive Loan Referral Bonuses under the Loan Referral Program.\n\nEligible Loan Referrers are limited to refer friends, colleagues, family members, and other people they (collectively, the “Eligible Loan Recipient(s)“) believe may be interested in applying for a student loan or personal loan product as described in a specific promotional campaign (collectively, the “Eligible Loan(s)“). SoFi Bank reserves the right to disqualify anyone from participating in the Loan Referral Program at any time. The Eligible Loan Referrers will NOT receive a Loan Referral Bonus for referrals for any other SoFi Bank loan products. Anyone who violates these terms and conditions is ineligible for payment of any bonus.\n\nTo receive credit for a referral under the Loan Referral Program, Eligible Loan Referrers must send their unique referral link to an Eligible Loan Recipient, the Eligible Loan Recipient must use their Eligible Loan Referrer’s unique referral link within 120 days after receipt of the Eligible Loan Referrer’s unique referral link, and the Eligible Loan Recipient must meet the terms and conditions of the specific promotional campaign associated with the unique referral link that was used for the referral. Further, in order for the Eligible Loan Recipient to receive their Loan Welcome bonus for a SoFi Personal Loan, the loan must still be an active loan in good standing ninety (90) days after the disbursement date. For Private Student Loan referrals, the Eligible Loan Recipient and Eligible Loan Referrer will receive their bonus sixty (60) days after their first loan disbursement, and the Eligible Loan Referrer is eligible for a maximum of 5 total referral bonuses for the Private Student Loan product. Further, for referrals for the Private Student Loan product no payments will be made if the Eligible Loan Referrer is employed by a qualified educational institution. If the Eligible Loan Recipient uses the Eligible Loan Referrer’s unique referral link and meets the terms and conditions of the specific promotional campaign associated with that unique referral link, SoFi Bank or its designee shall pay to (a) the Eligible Loan Referrer, a referral bonus into a SoFi Bank Checking or Savings account in the amount specified in the promotional campaign associated with the unique referral link that was used for the referral (the “Loan Referral Bonus“); and (b) the Eligible Loan Recipient, a welcome bonus into a SoFi Bank Checking or Savings account in the amount specified in the promotional campaign associated with the unique referral link that was used for the referral (the “Loan Welcome Bonus“). Only one Loan Referral Bonus and one Loan Welcome Bonus will be awarded for each referred Eligible Loan Recipient, regardless of whether the Eligible Loan Recipient takes out multiple Eligible Loans. Further, and notwithstanding the above, the following additional restrictions shall apply (1) no Loan Referral Bonus will be paid to otherwise Eligible Loan Referrers who are residents of Vermont, and (2) no Loan Referral Bonus will be paid for otherwise funded loans made to Vermont residents. An Eligible Loan Referrer will not earn a Loan Referral Bonus if the Eligible Loan Recipient has or had an existing funded SoFi loan account, or if the Eligible Loan Recipient does not use the unique referral link provided by the Eligible Loan Referrer.\n\nIf the Eligible Loan Recipient already has a SoFi loan account, is on our opt-out list or the national email opt-out list, or has already used another Eligible Loan Referrer’s unique referral link, the Eligible Loan Recipient may not be sent an email. We cannot disclose to you any information about funded loans opened by any Eligible Loan Recipients you refer to us. Participation in the Loan Referral Program serves as a one-time limited waiver of privacy rights by both parties, whereby each may become aware of the presence of an account relationship with SoFi Bank.\n\n$1,000 Medical and Dental Referral Offer: All referral program terms and conditions apply. Offer is subject to lender approval and not available to residents of Vermont. The offer is only open to new medical or dental Student Loan Refinance borrowers and may not be combined with other offers aside from the autopay discount. For both the referrer and referee to each receive a $1,000 bonus, the referee must: (1) register and apply for a medical or dental student loan refinance through the referral link provided; (2) meet SoFi’s underwriting criteria; (3) complete and fund a loan with SoFi; and (4) have or apply for a SoFi Checking and Savings or have a SoFi Money account to receive the bonus. Once conditions are met and the loan has been disbursed, both the referrer and referee welcome bonus will be deposited into their respective SoFi Checking and Savings or Money account within 30 calendar days. Bonuses that are not redeemed within 180 calendar days of the date they were made available to the recipient may be subject to forfeit. Bonus amounts of $600 or greater in a single calendar year will be reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as miscellaneous income to the recipient on Form 1099-MISC in the year received as required by applicable law. Recipient is responsible for any applicable federal, state or local taxes associated with receiving the bonus offer; consult your tax advisor to determine applicable tax consequences. SoFi reserves the right to change or terminate the offer at any time with or without notice.\n\nInvest Referral Program\n\nThe terms below and those set forth in Part II govern your participation in the SoFi Invest Referral Program (the “Invest Referral Program”). The Invest Referral Program is open to all current SoFi Active Invest account holders who meet the criteria below, and wish to refer someone to open a SoFi Invest account offered by SoFi Securities LLC. A referrer must have a SoFi Invest account offered by SoFi Securities LLC (either an Automated Invest account or an Active Invest account) which is funded and in good standing (i.e., not suspended) (an “Eligible Invest Referrer(s)”). Employees of Social Finance, LLC and its affiliates are not eligible to receive Invest Referral Bonuses under the Invest Referral Program.\n\nThe Eligible Invest Referrers are encouraged to refer friends, colleagues, family members, and anyone else they believe may be interested in opening a SoFi Active Invest account (the “Eligible Invest Recipient(s)”). The Eligible Invest Referrers will NOT receive an Invest Referral Bonus for referrals for a SoFi Automated Invest account. SoFi Securities LLC, or its designee (collectively, “SoFi Securities”) reserve the right to disqualify anyone from participation in the Invest Referral Program at any time.\n\nTo receive credit for a referral made under the Invest Referral Program, an Eligible Invest Referrer must access their own unique referral link and send it to the Eligible Invest Recipient(s) whom they wish to refer to open a new SoFi Active Invest Account (an “New Active Invest Account”). The Eligible Invest Recipient must use the Eligible Invest Referrer’s unique referral link to open a New Active Invest Account within 120 days after receipt of the Eligible Invest Referrer’s unique referral link, and meet the terms and conditions of the specific promotional campaign associated with the unique referral link that was used for the referral.\n\nFor each Eligible Invest Recipient who opens and funds a New Active Invest Account within 120 days after receipt of the Eligible Invest Referrer’s unique referral link, and meets the terms and conditions of the specific promotional campaign associated with the unique referral link that was used for the referral, SoFi Securities will: (a) credit an Invest account of the Eligible Invest Referrer with a referral bonus in the amount and method specified in the promotional campaign associated with the unique referral link that was used for the referral (the “Invest Referral Bonus”); and (b) credit the New Active Invest Account of the Eligible Invest Recipient, with a one-time welcome bonus in the amount and method specified in the promotional campaign associated with the unique referral link that was used for the referral (the “Invest Welcome Bonus”). Only one Invest Referral Bonus and one Invest Welcome Bonus will be awarded for each referred Eligible Invest Recipient, regardless of whether the Eligible Invest Recipient opens and funds multiple accounts. An Eligible Invest Referrer will not earn an Invest Referral Bonus if the Eligible Invest Recipient has or had an existing funded SoFi Invest account or does not use the unique referral link provided by the Eligible Invest Referrer.\n\nPlease note that if the Eligible Invest Recipient already has an Invest account, is on our opt-out list or on the national email opt-out list, or has already used another Eligible Invest Referrer’s unique referral link, SoFi Securities will not send an email to such Eligible Invest Recipient. We cannot disclose to you any information about New Active Invest Accounts opened by any Eligible Invest Recipients you refer to us. Participation in the Invest Referral Program serves as a one-time, limited waiver of privacy rights by both you and the Eligible Invest Recipient, pursuant to which each may become aware that the other has an account relationship with SoFi Securities.\n\nBank Referral Program\n\nTo receive the promotional bonus, referred participants must (i) apply and successfully open a SoFi Checking and Savings account and (ii) make deposits totaling $50 or more that settle within 21 days of clicking the referral link. Deposits must be made via an ACH transfer from a linked bank account, direct deposit, via “Instant Transfer” from a debit card (if available), from cash deposits, mobile check deposits (if available), or wires. Peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers are excluded (P2P transfers are defined as ACH-based P2P or debit-card based P2P transfers from Venmo, PayPal, Apple Cash, Square Cash, Zelle, etc). Once the bonus qualifications have been met, SoFi will: (a) credit referred members a one-time cash bonus of $25 into their SoFi Checking and Savings account and (b) credit the referrer a one-time cash bonus of $75 into their SoFi Checking and Savings account within 7 business days. The referrer must have an open SoFi Checking and Savings account within 60 days of a successful referral in order to receive their one-time cash bonus of $75. Note that this is a limited-time offer from SoFi with limited availability, and is subject to expire at any time. Referrers will not earn a referral bonus if the recipient has or had an existing SoFi account, or does not use the unique referral link provided by the referrer. Employees of Social Finance, LLC and its affiliates are not eligible to receive referral bonuses under the Bank Referral Program. In no event will any referrer or recipient be entitled to receive more than $10,000 in cumulative referral or welcome bonuses under all available SoFi referral programs within any calendar year. Bonuses are considered miscellaneous income, and will be reportable to the IRS on Form 1099-MISC (or Form 1042-S, if applicable). This SoFi Checking and Savings Referral Offer cannot be combined with the SoFi Checking and Savings “account $20 open offer.” SoFi reserves the right to disqualify anyone from participation in the referral program at any time. SoFi reserves the right to change or terminate the offer at any time without notice.\n\nGeneral Terms and Conditions — Part II\n\nReferral Cap\n\nIn no event will any person be entitled to receive more than $10,000 in cumulative referrals or welcome bonuses under these Referral Programs within any calendar year. In addition, SoFi reserves the right to, at any time, limit the maximum number of times a Referral Link can be used. Referral Bonuses and Welcome Bonuses are each considered miscellaneous income and may be reportable to the IRS on Form 1099-MISC (or Form 1042-S, if applicable).\n\nNon-Solicitation Agreement\n\nIf you participate in any of the Invest Referral Program, Money Referral Program, or the Loan Referral Program described above (collectively, the “Referral Program(s)”), you agree not to participate in any other solicitations for SoFi products. Other than as set forth herein, you agree not to compensate or accept any compensation from applicants whom you refer to SoFi through any of the corresponding Referral Programs described above. You further agree that your activities will be limited to referring potential customers as described above, so they may independently decide whether to apply. You may not collect information from eligible recipients under any Referral Program, assist with filling out an application, or discuss specific product terms.\n\nNo Spam\n\nYou must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, in soliciting referrals. Eligible referrers may not purchase internet search terms or publicly advertise SoFi’s products or name in any fashion. Further, any distribution of a program link that could constitute unsolicited commercial email or “spam,” any content which impersonates or implies an affiliation with or endorsement by SoFi or any SoFi subsidiary, or any actions which otherwise violate any terms or conditions imposed by SoFi, or that SoFi determines in its sole discretion to be fraudulent in nature, are prohibited and will be grounds for immediate termination from a Referral Program. We will not honor referral payments for referrals which are generated using any of the foregoing means.\n\nIndependent Contractor\n\nYour participation in a Referral Program is solely as an independent contractor. Neither you nor SoFi intend to establish an employment relationship, and you are not entitled to any benefits. We may require completion of a Form W-9 prior to payment of any referral or welcome bonus. Any payments that are not claimed within 180 days of the date the funds have been made available because either the direct deposit bank account or required tax information have not been provided are subject to forfeit.\n\nConflict\n\nIn the event any of the terms of these Terms of Service conflicts with any terms in a specific promotional campaign associated with a unique referral link, the terms of these Terms of Service shall govern.\n\nDiscontinuation of Previous Referral Program\n\nThe Referral Programs described herein replace all earlier versions of such SoFi referral programs. SoFi reserves the right to temporarily, or permanently modify or discontinue the Referral Programs at any time, for any reason, at our sole discretion and without notice to you.\n\n9.

SoFi Plus\n\nLast Updated: January 27, 2025\n\nSoFi Plus is a benefits program (“Plus Benefits Program”) offered by Social Finance, LLC and its affiliates (collectively “SoFi”) that gives SoFi Plus members (“defined below”) the opportunity to take advantage of various benefits across the SoFi ecosystem.\n\n(a) Eligibility:\n\nSoFi Plus members are defined as customers who meet either of the following eligibility criteria:\n\n(i) Customers of SoFi Checking and Savings, which is offered by SoFi Bank, National Association, Member FDIC, who receive a Direct Deposit (defined below) into a SoFi Checking and Savings account every 30 days. Direct Deposit means a recurring deposit of regular income to an account holder’s SoFi Checking or Savings account, including payroll, pension, or government benefit payments (e.g., Social Security), made by the account holder’s employer, payroll or benefits provider or government agency (“Direct Deposit”) via the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) Network. Deposits that are not from an employer or government agency, including but not limited to check deposits, peer-to-peer transfers (e.g., transfers from PayPal, Venmo, etc.), merchant transactions (e.g., transactions from PayPal, Stripe, Square, etc.), and bank ACH funds transfers and wire transfers from external accounts, or are non-recurring in nature (e.g., IRS tax refunds), do not constitute Direct Deposit activity. SoFi Bank shall, in its sole discretion, assess each account holder’s Direct Deposit activity to determine eligibility and may require additional documentation to complete this verification. SoFi Plus member benefits will be lost during periods in which the customer has turned off Direct Deposit into their account. If you are a joint account holder of a SoFi Checking and Savings account and either you or your joint account holder receives a Direct Deposit into your SoFi Checking and Savings account, then you will be eligible for all SoFi Plus benefits, including on accounts you hold in your own name.\n\n(ii) Customers who pay the SoFi Plus subscription fee of $10 (the “SoFi Plus Subscription Fee”) every 30 days via the SoFi mobile app. SoFi Plus member benefits will be lost during periods in which the customer has not paid the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee. See section 10(b) herein for the terms and conditions governing the Subscription Fee. If you are a joint account holder of a SoFi Checking and Savings account and only the other joint account holder pays the SoFi Plus subscription fee, then you will receive the high annual percentage yield (“APY”) set forth in Section 10(c)(i) herein, but you will not be eligible for all other SoFi Plus benefits, unless you meet either of the eligibility criteria described in this Section 10(a), or you are also a joint account owner on an account that receives benefits. Please note that availability of the paid subscription option will be rolled out in phases and may not be available to all members before mid-February.\n\nYou may only enroll in SoFi Plus if you are legally authorized to accept and be bound by these terms and are of a legal age to enter this Agreement.\n\n(b) SoFi Plus Subscription Fee\n\n(i) Payment Methods: Customers may use the following payment methods to pay the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee.\n\n(1) ACH Transfer from SoFi Checking Account: Customers may pay the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee from their SoFi Checking account. By submitting payment for the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee via the SoFi mobile app, you authorize SoFi to initiate ACH transfers every 30 days to SoFi by debiting your SoFi Checking account for the amount of the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee stated in section 10(a)(ii) herein. If we determine that you have insufficient funds in your SoFi Checking account to pay the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee, you will be prompted to add funds to your SoFi Checking account. If you fail to add funds to your SoFi Checking account, SoFi reserves the right to terminate your SoFi Plus benefits.\n\n(2) Credit Card or Debit Card: Customers may pay the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee via credit card or debit card. By submitting payment for the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee via the SoFi mobile app, you authorize SoFi to charge the credit card or debit card entered on the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee payment page every 30 days. If your selected payment method fails, you will not be enrolled as a SoFi Plus member.\n\n(ii) Billing Cycle: Your billing cycle start date is the date on which you click “Join SoFi Plus” in the SoFi mobile app. Upon clicking “Join SoFi Plus,” you will receive an email notification of the start of your SoFi Plus membership. You will also receive an email notification upon SoFi’s receipt of each SoFi Plus Subscription Fee payment.\n\n(iii) Canceling Payments: You can cancel your authorization of future ACH transfers or future credit card or debit card payments at any time by logging into your SoFi account and canceling your SoFi Plus membership on the subscription management page. You must cancel your SoFi Plus membership by 7:59 p.m. P.T. at least one (1) calendar day before the subscription renewal date to avoid being charged the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee for the next billing period. If a cancellation request is submitted after this time, you may be charged for the subsequent billing period. Please note that SoFi will not issue a partial refund for canceling a SoFi Plus membership before the end of a billing cycle. Upon successful cancellation, you will continue to enjoy all SoFi Plus benefits until the last day of your current billing cycle.\n\n(c) SoFi Plus Member Benefits:\n\n(i) 3.80% APY on savings:\n\nSoFi members with direct deposit activity can earn 3.80% annual percentage yield (APY) on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% APY on checking balances. Direct Deposit means a recurring deposit of regular income to an account holder’s SoFi Checking or Savings account, including payroll, pension, or government benefit payments (e.g., Social Security), made by the account holder’s employer, payroll or benefits provider or government agency (“Direct Deposit”) via the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) Network during a 30-day Evaluation Period (as defined below). Deposits that are not from an employer or government agency, including but not limited to check deposits, peer-to-peer transfers (e.g., transfers from PayPal, Venmo, etc.), merchant transactions (e.g., transactions from PayPal, Stripe, Square, etc.), and bank ACH funds transfers and wire transfers from external accounts, or are non-recurring in nature (e.g., IRS tax refunds), do not constitute Direct Deposit activity. There is no minimum Direct Deposit amount required to qualify for the stated interest rate. SoFi members with direct deposit are eligible for other SoFi Plus benefits.\n\nAs an alternative to direct deposit, SoFi members with Qualifying Deposits can earn 3.80% APY on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% APY on checking balances. Qualifying Deposits means one or more deposits that, in the aggregate, are equal to or greater than $5,000 to an account holder’s SoFi Checking and Savings account (“Qualifying Deposits”) during a 30-day Evaluation Period (as defined below). Qualifying Deposits only include those deposits from the following eligible sources: (i) ACH transfers, (ii) inbound wire transfers, (iii) peer-to-peer transfers (i.e., external transfers from PayPal, Venmo, etc. and internal peer-to-peer transfers from a SoFi account belonging to another account holder), (iv) check deposits, (v) instant funding to your SoFi Bank Debit Card, (vi) push payments to your SoFi Bank Debit Card, and (vii) cash deposits. Qualifying Deposits do not include: (i) transfers between an account holder’s Checking account, Savings account, and/or Vaults; (ii) interest payments; (iii) bonuses issued by SoFi Bank or its affiliates; or (iv) credits, reversals, and refunds from SoFi Bank, N.A. (“SoFi Bank”) or from a merchant. SoFi members with Qualifying Deposits are not eligible for other SoFi Plus benefits.\n\nSoFi Bank shall, in its sole discretion, assess each account holder’s Direct Deposit activity and Qualifying Deposits throughout each 30-Day Evaluation Period to determine the applicability of rates and may request additional documentation for verification of eligibility. The 30-Day Evaluation Period refers to the “Start Date” and “End Date” set forth on the APY Details page of your account, which comprises a period of 30 calendar days (the “30-Day Evaluation Period”). You can access the APY Details page at any time by logging into your SoFi account on the SoFi mobile app or SoFi website and selecting either (i) Banking > Savings > Current APY or (ii) Banking > Checking > Current APY. Upon receiving a Direct Deposit or $5,000 in Qualifying Deposits to your account, you will begin earning 3.80% APY on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% on checking balances on or before the following calendar day. You will continue to earn these APYs for (i) the remainder of the current 30-Day Evaluation Period and through the end of the subsequent 30-Day Evaluation Period and (ii) any following 30-day Evaluation Periods during which SoFi Bank determines you to have Direct Deposit activity or $5,000 in Qualifying Deposits without interruption.\n\nSoFi Bank reserves the right to grant a grace period to account holders following a change in Direct Deposit activity or Qualifying Deposits activity before adjusting rates. If SoFi Bank grants you a grace period, the dates for such grace period will be reflected on the APY Details page of your account. If SoFi Bank determines that you did not have Direct Deposit activity or $5,000 in Qualifying Deposits during the current 30-day Evaluation Period and, if applicable, the grace period, then you will begin earning the rates earned by account holders without either Direct Deposit or Qualifying Deposits until you have Direct Deposit activity or $5,000 in Qualifying Deposits in a subsequent 30-Day Evaluation Period. For the avoidance of doubt, an account holder with both Direct Deposit activity and Qualifying Deposits will earn the rates earned by account holders with Direct Deposit.\n\nSeparately, SoFi members who enroll in SoFi Plus by paying the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee every 30 days can also earn 3.80% APY on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% APY on checking balances. For additional details, see the SoFi Plus Terms and Conditions at https://www.sofi.com/terms-of-use/#plus.\n\nMembers without either Direct Deposit activity or Qualifying Deposits, as determined by SoFi Bank, during a 30-Day Evaluation Period and, if applicable, the grace period, or who do not enroll in SoFi Plus by paying the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee every 30 days, will earn 1.00% APY on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% APY on checking balances.\n\nInterest rates are variable and subject to change at any time. These rates are current as of 1/24/2025. There is no minimum balance requirement. Additional information can be found at https://www.sofi.com/legal/banking-rate-sheet.\n\n(ii) 10% Boost on Cash Back Rewards Points for SoFi Credit Card Purchases:\n\nMembers who meet the eligibility criteria shall earn a 10% boost on cash back rewards rates for all eligible purchases made with a SoFi Credit Card (the “Promotion”). A 10% boost means that a 10% multiplier shall be applied to existing cash back rewards rates (e.g., a purchase previously earning 100 rewards points would now earn 110 with the promotion). For purposes of calculating the 10% boost on cash back rewards points, each transaction shall be rounded to the nearest dollar, and fractional points shall be rounded to the nearest whole point. The 10% boost shall not apply to (i) transactions that are not eligible for cash back rewards points, including: fees or interest charges, balance transfers or cash advances, purchase of traveler’s checks or other cash equivalents, purchase or reloading of prepaid cards, or other quasi-cash transactions; or (ii) courtesy rewards points that are manually awarded. SoFi shall, in its sole discretion, determine whether a transaction is eligible to earn the 10% boost under this Promotion.\n\nTo be eligible for this Promotion, you must be successfully enrolled in SoFi Plus during the Promotion Period. In order to enroll in SoFi Plus and to continue to receive the 10% boost, you must either (i) receive a Direct Deposit during each 30-Day Evaluation Period (as defined below) or (ii) pay the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee every 30 days, as detailed in the SoFi Plus Terms and Conditions. Direct Deposit means a recurring deposit of regular income to an account holder’s SoFi Checking or Savings account, including payroll, pension, or government benefit payments (e.g., Social Security), made by the account holder’s employer, payroll or benefits provider or government agency (“Direct Deposit”) via the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) Network. Deposits that are not from an employer or government agency, including but not limited to check deposits, peer-to-peer transfers (e.g., transfers from PayPal, Venmo, etc.), merchant transactions (e.g., transactions from PayPal, Stripe, Square, etc.), and bank ACH funds transfers and wire transfers from external accounts, or are non-recurring in nature (e.g. IRS tax refunds), do not constitute Direct Deposit activity.\n\nThe 30-Day Evaluation Period refers to the “Start Date” and “End Date” set forth on the APY Details page of your account, which comprises a period of 30 calendar days (the “30-Day Evaluation Period”). You can access the APY Details page at any time by logging into your SoFi account on the SoFi mobile app or SoFi website and selecting either (i) Banking > Savings > Current APY or (ii) Banking > Checking > Current APY. Upon receiving a Direct Deposit to your account, you will begin earning the 10% boost on cash back rewards. You will continue to earn the 10% boost for (i) the remainder of the current 30-Day Evaluation Period and through the end of the subsequent 30-Day Evaluation Period and (ii) any following 30-day Evaluation Periods during which SoFi Bank determines you to have Direct Deposit activity without interruption. SoFi Bank reserves the right to grant a grace period to account holders following a change in Direct Deposit activity before terminating your 10% boost benefit. If SoFi Bank grants you a grace period, the dates for such grace period will be reflected on the APY Details page of your account. If SoFi Bank determines that you did not receive a Direct Deposit during the current 30-day Evaluation Period and, if applicable, the grace period, then you will no longer earn the 10% boost until you have Direct Deposit activity in a subsequent 30-Day Evaluation Period. In certain cases, it may take up to 90 days for your Direct Deposit to be recognized, after which you will begin earning the 10% boost on cash back rewards. If you do not see your 10% boost on cash back rewards benefit after 90 days, please contact our help center.\n\nPromotion Period: The Promotion will begin on 4/1/24 at 1:00 PM ET. SoFi reserves the right to terminate or make changes to this Promotion at any time.\n\nEligible Participants: All new and existing SoFi Credit Card members who successfully enroll in SoFi Plus during the Promotion Period are eligible for this Promotion. In order to enroll in SoFi Plus and to continue to receive the 10% boost, you must either (i) receive a Direct Deposit during each 30-Day Evaluation Period or (ii) pay the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee every 30 days, as detailed in the SoFi Plus Terms and Conditions. A member shall not earn the 10% boost under this Promotion if they are currently earning 3% cash back rewards points under the 3% Cash Back Rewards Promotion. If you currently benefit from the 3% Cash Back Rewards Promotion, then you will continue to earn 3% cash back rewards points until you are either no longer eligible or until the expiration of such benefit, as provided in the 3% Cash Back Rewards Promotion terms. Upon the expiration of your 3% cash back rewards points benefit, you will be eligible to earn the 10% boost under this Promotion, provided that you meet the eligibility criteria stated herein. Offer limited to one per SoFi Checking and Savings account. A SoFi Credit Card account will only benefit from the 10% boost under this Promotion if the primary SoFi Credit Card account holder receives a Direct Deposit into their SoFi Checking or Savings account (or, in the case of a joint Checking and Savings account, a joint account holder receives a Direct Deposit). SoFi reserves the right to exclude any member from participating in this Promotion for any reason, including suspected fraud, misuse, or if suspicious activities are observed.\n\n3% Cash Back Rewards on SoFi Credit Card Purchases for 12 months on your SoFi Credit Card:\n\nThe Promotion Period concluded on 4/1/24\n\nYou will need to receive a Direct Deposit every month into your SoFi Checking or Savings account in order to continue to receive this promotional cash back rewards rate. Direct Deposit means a deposit into an account holder’s SoFi Checking or Savings account, including payroll, pension, or government payments (e.g., Social Security), made by the account holder’s employer, payroll or benefits provider or government agency (“Direct Deposit”) via the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) Network. Deposits that are not from an employer or government agency, including but not limited to check deposits, peer-to-peer transfers (e.g., transfers from PayPal, Venmo, etc.), merchant transactions (e.g., transactions from PayPal, Stripe, Square, etc.), and bank ACH funds transfers and wire transfers from external accounts, do not constitute Direct Deposit activity and do not qualify for this promotion. It may take up to 90 days for your Direct Deposit to be recognized, after which you will begin earning 3% cash back rewards. If you do not see your 3% cash back rewards benefit after 90 days, please contact our help center. A maximum of 36,000 rewards points can be earned from this limited-time offer. After the Promotion Period ends or once you have earned the maximum points offered by this promotion, your cash back rewards earning rate will revert back to 2%. 36,000 rewards points are worth $360 when redeemed toward active SoFi accounts, including but not limited to, your SoFi Checking or Savings account, SoFi Money® account, SoFi Active Invest account, SoFi Credit Card account, SoFi Personal Loan, Private Student Loan, Student Loan Refinance, or toward SoFi Travel purchases.\n\nPromotion Period: The Promotion Period was available from 4/5/22 12:01AM ET to 4/1/24 12:59 PM ET (the “Promotion Period”). SoFi reserves the right to exclude any member from participating in the SoFi Member Rewards Program for any reason, including suspected fraud, misuse, or if suspicious activities are observed. SoFi also reserves the right to stop or make changes to this Program at any time.\n\nEligible Participants: All new members who apply and get approved for the SoFi Credit Card, open a SoFi Checking and Savings account, and receive a Direct Deposit into their SoFi Checking and Savings account during the Promotion Period are eligible. All existing SoFi Credit Card members who receive a Direct Deposit for the first time into their SoFi Checking & Savings account during the Promotion Period are eligible. For the avoidance of doubt, SoFi must receive the Direct Deposit prior to the end of the Promotion Period for a member to be eligible. All existing SoFi members who have already enrolled in Direct Deposit into a SoFi Checking & Savings account prior to the promotion period, and who apply and get approved for a SoFi Credit Card during the promotion period are eligible. Existing SoFi members who already have the SoFi Credit Card and previously set up Direct Deposit through SoFi Money or SoFi Checking & Savings are not eligible for this promotion. Offer limited to one per SoFi Checking & Savings account. In the case of a joint account, only the primary account holder (the member who signed up first) is eligible for the offer.\n\n(iii) 2x rewards points on qualifying activities:\n\nSoFi Plus members can earn double the rewards points as stated in the “Ways to earn” section of the Membership & Rewards Center for qualifying earning activities during periods in which the SoFi Plus member meets the SoFi Plus eligibility criteria. The qualifying earning activities exclude the following: Credit or Debit card spend paid in rewards points, welcome bonuses paid in rewards points (including any referral bonuses paid in rewards points), and select promotions with bonuses paid in rewards points. The specific number of rewards points is subject to change at any time and can be found in the “Ways to earn” section of the Membership & Rewards Center.\n\n(iv) 1% Invest match:\n\nINVESTMENTS ARE NOT FDIC INSURED • ARE NOT BANK GUARANTEED • MAY LOSE VALUE\n\nYou must be a SoFi Plus member at the time a recurring deposit is received into your SoFi InvestⓇ account in order to receive this 1% match benefit. “Recurring deposits” refer to ACH transfers scheduled with a frequency of weekly, every two weeks, or monthly into either your Active SoFi InvestⓇ account or your SoFi Wealth Automated Investing account. Regular deposits set up from your SoFi Checking & Savings account using Autopilot are eligible for the bonus. One-time transfers are excluded from the bonus. If funds are withdrawn and later redeposited manually into your SoFi InvestⓇ account, the manual deposit will not be eligible for the bonus. Offer can be combined with SoFi Invest 1% IRA match.\n\nSoFi Invest encompasses two distinct companies, with various products and services offered to investors as described below:\n\n1) Automated Investing and advisory services are provided by SoFi Wealth LLC, an SEC-registered investment adviser (“SoFi Wealth“). Brokerage services are provided to SoFi Wealth LLC by SoFi Securities LLC.\n\n2) Active Investing and brokerage services are provided by SoFi Securities LLC, Member FINRA/SIPC. Clearing and custody of all securities are provided by APEX Clearing Corporation.\n\nIndividual customer accounts may be subject to the terms applicable to one or more of these platforms. For additional disclosures related to the SoFi Invest platforms described above please visit SoFi.com/legal.\n\nNeither the Investment Advisor Representatives of SoFi Wealth, nor the Registered Representatives of SoFi Securities are compensated for the sale of any product or service sold through any SoFi Invest platform.\n\nPlease note that the Active Invest platform is self-directed, therefore all monies transferred to your SoFi Active Invest will not be automatically invested.\n\nBonuses will be paid out as rewards points within two weeks of the end of the calendar month. See Rewards Terms of Service. Members must enroll in Rewards in order to redeem their points, but not to be eligible for the bonus. Learn more about our SoFi Member Rewards Program here. Bonus will not be paid out on SoFi InvestⓇ or SoFi Wealth accounts that are closed or pending closure.\n\nBonus amounts are calculated on the total net recurring inflows (incoming recurring ACH transfers less outgoing transfers) per calendar month. For example, if you have a recurring Invest deposit of $1,000 on 11/4/2024 and withdraw $500 on 11/15/2024 and make no other deposits or withdrawals to your SoFi InvestⓇ account for the month, you will earn 500 rewards points, equal to 1% of $500 net monthly inflows. If you lose SoFi Plus eligibility at any point throughout the month, you will earn the 1% match only on recurring deposits received while you were a Plus member. All withdrawals in the calendar month (regardless of Plus status) will count against your bonus. For example, if you have a recurring Invest deposit of $1,000 on 11/4/2024 as a SoFi Plus member, lose Plus status on 11/10/2024, and have another recurring Invest deposit of $1,000 on 11/12/2024, you would earn $10 in rewards points (1% of the $1,000 that was deposited while you were a Plus member).\n\nEligibility Period: Funds must remain in your SoFi InvestⓇ account for two years to be eligible for the bonus. If the deposit is removed prior to the end of the two-year Eligibility Period, SoFi, at its discretion may remove the corresponding proportion of the 1% Match from the customer’s account. For instance, if $1,000 was deposited receiving a $10 rewards points match and $500 was withdrawn in a subsequent month, SoFi may remove $5 in rewards points from the bonus. SoFi reserves the right to liquidate securities to pay for the removal of the Match bonus. Further, SoFi may bill this to a receiving firm in the event of an account transfer.\n\n(v) Appointments with financial planners:\n\nSoFi Plus members can schedule an unlimited number of appointments with a financial planner during periods in which the SoFi Plus member meets the eligibility criteria set forth in section 10(a) of the SoFi Plus Terms and Conditions. SoFi members who are not members of SoFi Plus can schedule one (1) appointment with a financial planner. The ability to schedule appointments is subject to financial planner availability. SoFi reserves the right to change or terminate this benefit at any time with or without notice. Advisory services are offered by SoFi Wealth LLC, an SEC-registered investment adviser. Information about SoFi Wealth’s advisory operations, services, and fees is set forth in SoFi Wealth’s current Form ADV Part 2 (Brochure), a copy of which is available upon request and at www.adviserinfo.sec.gov.\n\n(vi) Preferred access to IPOs:\n\nA SoFi Plus membership is one of many factors used by Sofi Securities LLC to determine an investor’s allocation.

      "# [What Is Spoofing in Trading? How It Works and Its Consequences on 2024-11-18](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/what-is-spoofing-trading/)\nIn the financial space, the term “spoofing” refers to an illegal form of stock market and exchange trickery that is often used to change asset prices. Given that the stock markets are a wild place, and everyone is trying to gain an advantage, spoofing is one way in which some traders bend the rules to try and gain an advantage.\n\nSpoofing is also something that traders and investors should be aware of. This tactic is sometimes used to change asset prices — whether stocks, bonds, or cryptocurrencies.\n\nKey Points\n\n• Spoofing is an illegal trading tactic where traders place and cancel orders to manipulate asset prices, influencing market supply and demand dynamics.\n\n• Traders often use algorithms to execute high volumes of fake orders, creating a false perception of demand that can inflate or deflate security prices.\n\n• The practice of spoofing is a criminal offense in the U.S., established under the Dodd-Frank Act, with serious penalties for those caught engaging in it.\n\n• Significant fines have been imposed on both institutions and individual traders for spoofing, highlighting the risks of detection and legal consequences.\n\n• Investors should remain vigilant against spoofing, as it can distort market activity and impact trading strategies, particularly for active traders and day traders.\n\nWhat Is Spoofing?\n\nSpoofing is when traders place market orders — either buying or selling securities — and then cancel them before the order is ever fulfilled. In a sense, it’s the practice of initiating fake orders, with no intention of ever seeing them executed.\n\nSpoofing means that someone or something is effectively spamming the markets with orders, in an attempt to move security prices.\n\n💡 Quick Tip: Investment fees are assessed in different ways, including trading costs, account management fees, and possibly broker commissions. When you set up an investment account, be sure to get the exact breakdown of your “all-in costs” so you know what you’re paying.\n\nWhat’s the Point of Spoofing?\n\nBecause stock market prices are determined by supply and demand — for instance, the more demand there is for Stock A, the higher Stock A’s price is likely to go, and vice versa — they can be manipulated to gain an advantage. That’s where spoofing comes in.\n\nBy using bots or an algorithm to make a high number of trades and then cancel them before they go through, it’s possible for spoofers to manipulate security prices. For a trader looking to buy or sell a certain security, those valuations may be moved enough to increase the profitability of a trade.\n\nSpamming the markets with orders creates the illusion that demand for a security is either up or down, which is then reflected in the security’s price. Because it would require an awful lot of “spoofed” orders to move valuations, spoofers might rely on an algorithm to place and cancel orders for them, rather than handle it manually. For that reason, spoofing is typically associated with high-frequency trading (HFT).\n\nIs Spoofing Illegal?\n\nIf it sounds like spoofing is essentially cheating the system, that’s because it is. In the United States, spoofing is illegal, and is a criminal offense. Spoofing was made illegal as a part of the Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law in 2010. Specifically, spoofing is described as a “disruptive practice” in the legislation, straight from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which is the independent agency responsible for overseeing and policing spoofing on the markets:\n\nDodd-Frank section 747 amends section 4c(a) of the CEA to make it unlawful for any person to engage in any trading, practice, or conduct on or subject to the rules of a registered entity that —\n\n(A) violates bids or offers;\n\n(B) demonstrates intentional or reckless disregard for the orderly execution of transactions during the closing period; or\n\n(C) is, is of the character of, or is commonly known to the trade as ‘spoofing’ (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution).\n\nAdditionally, there are laws and rules related to spoofing under rules from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), too.\n\nExample of Spoofing\n\nA hypothetical spoofing scenario isn’t too difficult to dream up. For instance, let’s say Mike, a trader, has 100,000 shares of Firm Y stock, and he wants to sell it. Mike uses an algorithm to place hundreds of “buy” orders for Firm Y shares — an algorithm that will also cancel those orders before they’re executed, so that no money is actually spent.\n\nThe influx of orders is read by the market as an increase in demand for Firm Y stock, and the price starts to increase. Mike then sells his 100,000 shares at an inflated price — an artificially inflated price, since Mike effectively manipulated the market to increase his profits.\n\nConsequences of Spoofing\n\nBecause spoofing is a relatively easy way to manipulate markets and potentially increase profits, it’s also a fairly common practice for some traders and firms, despite being against the law. That transgression can cost spoofers if and when they’re caught.\n\nFor example, one financial institution was fined nearly $1 billion by the SEC during the fall of 2020 after the company was caught conducting spoofing activity in the precious metals market.\n\nBut it’s not just the big players that can be on the receiving end of a smack down by the authorities. During August of 2020, an individual day trader was caught manipulating the markets through spoofing activity — actions that netted the trader roughly $140,000 in profits. The trader was ultimately ordered by the CFTC to pay a fine of more than $200,000.\n\nDespite the cases that make headlines, it’s generally hard to identify and catch spoofers. With so many orders being placed and executed at once (especially with algorithmic or computer aid) it’s difficult to identify fake market orders in real time.\n\nHow to Protect Against Spoofing\n\nThere are a number of parties that are constantly and consistently trying to gain an edge in the markets, be it through spoofing or other means. For investors, it’s worth keeping that in mind while sticking to an investing strategy that works for you, rather than investing with your emotions or getting caught up in the news cycle.\n\nIn a time when a single social media post or errant comment on TV can send stock prices soaring or into the gutter, it’s critical for investors to understand what’s driving market activity.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nSpoofing is meant to gain advantage in the markets, but as such it’s illegal and penalties can be steep. Beyond the spoofers trying to manipulate the market, spoofing has the potential to affect all investors.\n\nIf spoofers are manipulating prices for their own gain, that can cause traders and investors to react, not realizing what is going on behind the scenes. While this is more of an issue for active investors or day traders, it’s something to be aware of.\n\nReady to invest in your goals? It’s easy to get started when you open an investment account with SoFi Invest. You can invest in stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), mutual funds, alternative funds, and more. SoFi doesn’t charge commissions, but other fees apply (full fee disclosure here).\n\nFor a limited time, opening and funding an Active Invest account gives you the opportunity to get up to $1,000 in the stock of your choice.\n\nPhoto credit: iStock/visualspace",
      "# [SOFI TUKKER joins Jermaine Dupri, 40+ creative thinkers at Ideas Festival Emory Sept. 20](https://news.emory.edu/stories/2024/09/er_ideas_festival_dupri_sofi_tukker_05-09-2024/story.html)\nGrammy-nominated genre-defying duo SOFI TUKKER has joined the lineup for the inaugural Ideas Festival Emory, organizers announced Sept. 9. The festival, a celebration of creative minds, is set to take place Sept. 20-22 on Emory University’s Oxford College campus.\n\nThe group, comprising Sophie Hawley-Weld and Tucker Halpern, recently released their third studio album “BREAD.” An acronym for Be Really Energetic and Dance, “BREAD” encapsulates their infectious music, which spreads themes of liberation, unity and self-empowerment. The band has amassed more than three billion streams, earned platinum and gold records on five continents and been featured in several brand campaigns for Apple, Peloton and Smartwater.\n\nAs part of the festival, the duo will speak with Matt Whyte, host of the Sing for Science podcast, which connects musicians with scientists. SOFI TUKKER will chat about bread, the beloved food staple, and the chemistry that makes it so delicious with Maria Ortiz — the food scientist behind the popular Instagram account All You Knead is Bread — on Sunday, Sept. 22 at 4:30 p.m.\n\nHosted by Emory’s Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, the event — which is free and open to the public — also features live music, local food vendors, children’s programming and exhibits. Festival registration is open.\n\nSOFI TUKKER joins the previously announced keynote speaker, renowned rapper, producer and record executive Jermaine Dupri, and more than 40 other speakers at the festival, intended to connect students and the greater community with visionary scholars, creators and thought leaders, including a Pulitzer-winning journalist, transformative business executive, New York Times-bestselling music historian and innovative toy designer.\n\nDuring the festival’s keynote session Friday evening, Dupri, a Grammy Award winner, Atlanta native and founder of So So Def Recordings, will engage in conversation with Whyte and Joycelyn Wilson, assistant professor in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication at Georgia Tech. Through her work as an ethnographer, Wilson has traced the cultural forces that have shaped Atlanta’s unique identity as the thriving epicenter of hip hop and R&B.\n\nDelving into multiple themes\n\nAdditional speaker sessions on Saturday and Sunday will cover an array of themes including science, history, literature, entrepreneurship, music and cinematography and photography. The full schedule and speaker biographies are now available on the newly launched Ideas Festival Emory website.\n\nJust a few of the notable speakers include:\n\nBarbara Kopple, a two-time Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker;\n\nVirginia Willis, a James Beard award-winning cookbook author and chef;\n\nJon Goode, an Emmy-nominated writer whose work has been featured on CNN, HBO and BET;\n\nStephanie Stuckey, board chair of Stuckey’s, the candy manufacturer; and\n\nCarrie Buse, head of design for Mattel’s Future Lab, which focuses on innovative products and play experiences.\n\nThroughout the weekend, Ideas Festival Emory will feature live music and entertainment on the Oxford College quad, photography exhibits and food and drink vendors.\n\nThe event will also include children’s programming and collaborations with local schools. In partnership with the Newton Education Foundation, the Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement will host hundreds of students from Newton County Schools, providing them with a unique learning opportunity to connect with children’s book authors.\n\nThe festival has attracted sponsors committed to engaging individuals and families across the metro Atlanta region in its programming, including Lumina Foundation, WABE, the City of Covington and Rough Draft Atlanta.\n\nKen Carter, Charles Howard Candler Professor of Psychology and founding director of the Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, believes the festival — the center’s flagship event — will be distinctive in its mission to share ideas and spark curiosity with local and global audiences.\n\n“Ideas Festival Emory is a celebration of creativity and innovation, connecting the public with visionary leaders who inspire and challenge us,” says Carter. “We hope the festival will ignite new ideas and inspire meaningful conversations, in an environment that will be fun for people of all ages.”\n\nWhile attendees will engage with and learn from speakers during the sessions, Carter hopes the festival will have an impact that stretches beyond the three-day event. Speaker sessions will be recorded for an upcoming podcast that will help extend the festival's reach and attract curious listeners from around the world.\n\nThe Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, established in 2023, aims to help faculty and students proactively engage in public conversation and increase confidence in the value of scholarship and evidence-based research. With plans to expand its programming and host a Public Scholarship Academy for faculty in May 2025, the center — housed at Oxford College — hopes to establish itself as a novel space where scholars share knowledge and insights directly with the community.\n\n“I’m proud that Oxford College is home to the Emory Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, and we look forward to hosting this incredible weekend of exploration and discovery on our beautiful campus,” says Oxford Dean Badia Ahad.\n\n“Bringing together a diversity of scholars, artists and writers to discuss some of the most pressing and complex issues of our time is particularly important in this cultural moment when we need more and better models of civil discourse, free expression of ideas and constructive dialogue,” Ahad continues. “This perfectly captures the spirit of education and collaboration we embrace here at Oxford and Emory.”",

      "# [Launch Dates Confirmed for TGL presented by SoFi, Starting in Prime Time on ESPN](https://tglgolf.com/articles/2024/03/tgl-presented-by-sofi--coming-january-2025)\nMatches 1, 2 and 3 of the first TGL presented by SoFi season will all take place on Tuesdays in January and be live from SoFi Center. The first night of TGL action will be Tuesday, January 7th.\n\nThe full TGL schedule - including matchups - will be announced later this year.\n\nThe launch of TGL’s inaugural season will benefit from promotion during ESPN’s comprehensive coverage of the NFL Playoffs and new 12-team College Football Playoff. At this time of year, ESPN’s coverage includes TGL’s week 2 match on Tuesday, Jan 14, the night following ESPN’s Monday Night Football Wild Card Playoff game, and TGL’s week 3 match on Tuesday, Jan 21, the night following ESPN’s coverage of the College Football Playoff National Championship Game.\n\nESPN’s NFL Playoff game and College Football National Championship Game are traditionally the network’s most-watched games each year and drive January as the network’s most-watched month.\n\n“As we plan the 2025 launch of TGL presented by SoFi, we now have the first three Tuesdays in January circled to introduce sports fans to this new form of team golf. January is a tremendous time of year for fans looking for prime time sports and TGL’s launch will complement the start of the PGA TOUR season and take advantage of ESPN’s promotional machine across their coverage of the NFL and college football playoffs,” said Mike McCarley, founder and CEO of TMRW Sports.\n\n“We’re grateful for our tremendous partner SoFi, who shares in our vision to harness technology to create new approaches within traditional institutions. As construction proceeds on SoFi Center, we’re eager to introduce sports fans to TGL as we focus on the league’s debut this coming January.”\n\n“From our very first conversation, there’s been a natural alignment between TGL’s innovative, tech-forward approach to golf with SoFi’s similar approach to helping millions get their money right with our digital all-in-one banking and financial services platform,” said SoFi CEO Anthony Noto. “Investing in sports like our partnerships with the NFL and the NBA has proven unequivocally valuable, and we’re thrilled to be partnering with TMRW Sports to bring the SoFi Center and TGL to life.”\n\nAll the action will take place in the custom-built SoFi Center, a steel-supported structure located on the campus of Palm Beach State College in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. The six teams consist of the PGA TOUR's top talent who will compete in a 15-match regular season, plus semifinals and finals matches in the 250,000-square-foot venue.\n\nSoFi Center is an unprecedented, tech-infused arena for golf and will create an intimate and unique “greenside” experience for fans with 1,500 seats wrapping around TGL’s field of play, which is similar to the size of a football field at 97-yards long and 50-yards wide.\n\nTGL matches will start with teams teeing off from real grass tee boxes to play custom-designed, virtual holes projected onto a 64’x53’ screen, more than 24 times larger than a standard golf simulator screen (144 square feet, 16’x9’). Once teams are inside approximately 50 yards they will transition to live action and finish each hole within TGL’s GreenZone, a 22,475-square-foot short game complex that transforms between holes.\n\nThe GreenZone will use advanced technology to make each hole a unique challenge for the teams, including its 41-yard-wide turntable that rotates the green and three bunkers to change approach angles and using nearly 600 motorized actuators as part of Full Swing’s Virtual Green technology embedded under the synthetic putting surface to morph its topography.\n\nEvery shot will be broadcast live during TGL, with teams playing within a 40-second shot clock. All players will also be mic’d up to bring fans closer to the action with real-time strategy discussions.",
