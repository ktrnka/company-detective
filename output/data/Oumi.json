      "# [Oumi Unveils First Unconditionally Open AI Platform](https://oumi.ai/blog/posts/press-release)\nOumi Unveils First Unconditionally Open AI Platform to Ensure AI is Developed Collectively and Responsibly\n\nJanuary 29th, 2025\n\nOumi unites AI researchers and developers globally to collaborate, experiment, and build together the world's largest state-of-the-art open-source laboratory.\n\nSeattle, WA - Oumi, an AI laboratory created in collaboration with researchers from 13 leading research universities, including Carnegie Mellon University, Stanford University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has unveiled the world's first unconditionally open source AI platform. By enabling open collaboration, Oumi enables thousands of researchers, developers, and AI experts to come together for the first time to advance AI collectively and responsibly.\n\nThe development of multimodal foundation models has largely been limited to incumbent AI platform companies, which release models as closed, proprietary black boxes, or masquerade open-weight models as \"open source.\" Oumi is the first to launch a platform that offers state-of-the-art foundation models with open code, open data, open weights—and open collaboration—uniting a global community of developers and researchers to drive AI forward responsibly and transparently. Oumi is a Public Benefit Corporation and announced $10 million in Seed funding led by Venrock and Obvious Ventures with contributions from Plug & Play and Ascend.\n\n\"AI needs its Linux,\" said Manos Koukoumidis, CEO and Co-founder of Oumi and previously a Senior Engineering Manager at Google Cloud AI who bootstrapped and led the efforts for Cloud PaLM. \"The greatest technology innovations are developed in the open. We must open AI up to the open source community to advance it collectively and responsibly. To make it accessible to everyone.\"\n\nOumi is designed to support all common foundation model workflows in one unified platform to promote accessibility and to foster open collaboration with all AI researchers and developers. With the all-in-one Oumi platform, developers can:\n\nTrain and fine-tune models from 10M to 405B parameters using state-of-the-art techniques (SFT, LoRA, QLoRA, DPO, and more)\n\nWork with both text and multimodal models (Llama, Qwen, Phi, and others)\n\nSynthesize and curate training data with LLM judges, then readily use it to train models\n\nDeploy models efficiently with popular inference engines (vLLM, SGLang)\n\nEvaluate models comprehensively across standard benchmarks\n\nRun anywhere - from laptops to clusters to clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP, Lambda, and more)\n\nIntegrate with both open models and commercial APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex AI, Parasail, etc.)\n\nThe current AI landscape creates the illusion of a talent desert that is now starting to impact innovation, as resources focus on individual, rather than collective, AI projects.\n\n\"Our vision with Oumi is to free the AI talent locked in silos and make AI the ultimate team sport,\" said Oussama Elachqar, Co-founder of Oumi and previously a Machine Learning Engineer at Apple. \"Giving AI talent a platform where they can work collectively will accelerate progress and speed of discovery in every area of AI. We have incredibly talented and bright developers and researchers in AI working in silos. If we unite them, we will get further, faster.\"\n\n\"There hasn't been enough focus on open experimentation to collectively push the boundaries of what AI can do,\" said Ganesh Srinivasan, Partner at Venrock. \"With an unconditionally open source platform, we won't cap our talent, we will foster experimentation, and society will reap the benefits.\"\n\nOumi is designed to be fully flexible and easy to use. The end-to-end, all-in-one platform supports the full AI lifecycle with one consistent interface - from pretraining to data curation, data synthesis, fine-tuning (SFT, LoRA, QLoRA, DPO), inference, and evaluation. Users can seamlessly work with both open models (Llama, QWEN, Phi and others) and commercial APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex AI), with both text and multimodal models. Oumi will offer prebuilt ready-to-use workflows and recipes for post training and other common operations.\n\nOumi can run anywhere so that developers can train and evaluate models seamlessly across environments, from local machines to remote clusters and clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP, Lambda), with native support for Jupyter notebooks and VS Code debugging. Additionally, the enterprise-grade platform is built for scale, offering first-class support for distributed training with PyTorch DDP and FSDP and ability to efficiently handle models up to 405B parameters.\n\nTo better enable the community to build upon each other's work independently, or to collaborate in research efforts, the recordability and reproducibility of experiments is a key design principle of the Oumi platform. To further promote the collective improvement of foundation models, Oumi plans to coordinate joint research efforts with fully open participation across the world.\n\nOumi is developed in partnership with researchers at the following universities:\n\nUniversity of Illinois Urbana Champaign\n\nCarnegie Mellon University\n\nPrinceton University\n\nStanford University\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\n\nUniversity of Washington\n\nNew York University\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nUniversity of Waterloo\n\nUniversity of Cambridge\n\nUniversity of Oxford",
      "# [If AI isn't truly open, it will fail us](https://oumi.ai/blog/posts/truly-open-ai)\nJanuary 29th, 2025\n\nImagine a world without electricity, cars, computers, the internet — a truly bleak place. Or one where each of these things are owned and controlled by one company. That's what our world would look like today if the human knowledge that brought about these innovations had been locked away, never shared openly. None of the benefits of modern technology, science or healthcare would be there for us to move society forward — together — at the rate we have. We would be set back hundreds of years.\n\nCurrently, we're faced with the risk of AI, our most powerful invention, failing us. For the sake of short-sighted commercialization and in complete misalignment with humanity's best interests, the development of this highly complex technology has become increasingly closed. Leaders in the industry have become increasingly secretive, moving further and further away from open knowledge sharing and collaboration. Instead, they are feverishly competing against each other to \"win,\" all while wastefully re-inventing each other's work at enormous human, capital, and environmental cost.\n\nAnd despite this high cost, they are still failing us. The technology is too complex for any single company to advance effectively on its own, without openly sharing knowledge and collaborating with the rest of the AI community. Yet, these leading AI companies try to arrogantly dissuade others from pursuing this technology. They want you to believe that the future of AI progress is closed, that it is our destiny to kneel at their feet. They want you to pay tribute and let them freely monetize. They want you to believe that they are the chosen prophets that will lead us all to our AI salvation.\n\nThis pattern is straight out of the Unix playbook. The major tech players developed their proprietary, closed-source versions of Unix, and those seemed to be the only \"possible\" and \"right\" solutions. The argument, or assumption, was that these major tech players were the only ones with the talent, quality and capacity to develop versions of Unix. Then, Linux showed the world how open source was a better approach to developing such a critical and complex technology. Linux gave the crucial flexibility that developers needed to customize it to their needs. It gave them the ownership they needed to avoid getting locked into a closed vendor. It gave them the transparency they needed to fully trust it. All that at a lower cost. As more and more developers adopted Linux, the Linux ecosystem became more mature, safe, versatile and performant than any closed Unix alternative. It became the de facto platform — the platform that is now powering practically all cloud computing and most mobile devices, the internet, and the development of AI itself.\n\nI believe that AI will develop not just in a similar way, but in an even more profound one. If there was ever a technology that should and can thrive in open source, it is AI. Open source AI is not only the best solution for the good of humanity overall, but also for the benefit of every single individual developer and enterprise. At the same time, it is the best path for developing the most competitive version of AI, the one that would dominate the same way Linux did.\n\nHow Open Source Benefits Humanity\n\nAI represents our best opportunity for humanity's advancement. Open source is the best path we have for AI to effectively and safely unlock industry applications and promote scientific discovery.\n\nWithout Open Source, the Bottleneck for Advancement Gets Narrower\n\nFoundation models are used across many different tasks, from improving simple traditional scenarios like classification to diverse, higher-level automation tasks. No single AI solution developed by a single company can solve and optimize for all of them at the same time — there is no AI silver bullet. AI has also become critical to advancing the sciences across the board, from healthcare to weather forecasting, from partial differential equation solving to biology. If frontier AI continues down the path of black-box APIs, scientific progress will be needlessly impeded.\n\nOpen Source is the Safest Option\n\nMaking foundation models safe, unbiased, culturally-inclusive, privacy-preserving, and secure across diverse modalities and tasks is no easy feat, to say the least. No existing big tech company seems to be able to invest enough to solve all these challenges – especially when they are entrenched in one-upping their competitors in the public AI leaderboards, as opposed to focusing on what would benefit the world at large.\n\nOpen source not only helps to collectively invest in AI safety, but even to discover the issues that need fixing in the first place. Per Linus' Law, \"Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.\" It stands to reason that \"given enough eyeballs, all AI issues are shallow\" too. The open source approach enables the collective review and contributions of a large community, allowing for such issues to be quickly identified and resolved.\n\nThere is also, of course, the significant debate on the hypothetical existential risks posed by superintelligent misaligned AI. Regardless of where you stand on this matter and the probability you assign to this possibility, one thing is certain: such challenges can be better solved in the open with broad collaboration as opposed to in secret by a single organization whose top goal is a sprint to monetization.\n\nOpen Source Provides the Critical Balance of Power\n\nTo put it plainly, the control of such a powerful technology should not be in the hands of a small handful of corporations. This would lead to extreme centralization of power with significant societal, economic, and ethical implications. Negative repercussions have a far greater chance of being mitigated with an open source approach.\n\nHow Open Source Benefits Developers\n\nAs with open source Linux, open source AI has many critical attributes that make it a better choice for developers and organizations:\n\nTrust, Privacy, and Security\n\nOrganizations need AI that they can trust. AI data is often sensitive — it may contain private personal information and IP. Organizations don't want to trust closed vendors' infrastructure with their sensitive data. They don't want their data stored on the vendor's cloud and processed with non-transparent code. As in the case of Linux, open source can not only be more secure, but it also provides organizations with the flexibility to deploy it on the trusted infrastructure of their choosing.\n\nAnd regardless of the infrastructure used, organizations often cannot trust the AI itself when it is developed and offered as a black box solution. For full security and transparency, organizations need to understand how it was developed, so that they can anticipate its behavior and better understand how they can improve what matters for their use case specifically. Ultimately, they need more transparency for auditability and compliance.\n\nFlexibility Fuels Differentiation\n\nAt the end of the day, closed vendor APIs don't provide enough flexibility for much-needed differentiation. Developers are often initially impressed by the quality of the results they get from calling a closed vendor's API with an LLM prompt honed for their particular scenario — AI has come a long way in the last few years. However, what developers sometimes don't realize, especially when misled by \"experts\"1, is that overreliance on such limited, closed APIs, could be setting their organization up for eventual failure. For AI-first companies to succeed, they need AI differentiation. That is, what level of differentiation can an organization really achieve with a bespoke prompt, which a competitor could easily replicate?\n\nTo differentiate, organizations need to leverage their unique and invaluable troves of data and expertise. And to leverage such data, organizations need AI that is easy to use and gives them full flexibility to adjust it to their needs as they build their AI muscle. Unfortunately, some organizations, for the sake of \"convenience,\" may seem content, lingering in AI's shallow waters: customizing prompts and calling APIs that allow for limited tuning. But such organizations are missing key opportunities for differentiation and will likely find themselves on the wrong side of history. Their competitors likely won't make the same mistake.\n\nHigher Quality and Richer Features at a Lower Cost\n\nOpen source solutions that are backed by strong communities can tap on a diverse and deep well of talent. That helps them to often have at the same time richer features, stronger performance and lower cost than any of the closed source alternatives. Linux makes this case perfectly.\n\nKeeping the Keys to the Castle: Staying in Control and Avoiding Lock-in\n\nLock-in greatly decreases an organization's flexibility to innovate, while typically increasing its costs. Organizations know that, and thus, they don't want to get locked into a specific closed vendor's model, cloud, and hardware; they want control and flexibility. They also want predictability. It can be very disruptive for an organization when a closed vendor forces changes in the model, related infrastructure, or terms of use.\n\nHow Community Can Develop the Best AI\n\nAI isn't just a team sport: it's a global effort. AI is very complex, with a lot of issues to fix and capabilities to improve: it's worthy of having a global team tackle it. The innovation and experimentation needed can be easily pursued in parallel across a distributed and loosely-coupled large global team, an open community spreading all across the world.\n\nTo protect their interests, closed vendors openly brag about how many GPUs they have in their attempt to secure their compute \"moat.\" But, I truly believe that an open community can do at least as well as they can. In fact, I think that it can do a lot better. Certainly compute is needed for AI research, but, especially with pre-training scaling laws hitting a wall, a relatively \"small\" siloed group of people doesn't stand a chance against a massive open community, when it comes to innovating on new algorithms. Similarly, with post-training, which does not require the same level of experimentation resources, would the siloed group or the large community deliver higher quality, safer, more secure, more reliable, and more versatile models across all the modalities, tasks, and higher level systems and applications?\n\nImagine there are two horses in the AI race. There is the closed-source horse that tries to do everything by itself in its silo, bearing the full cost for its efforts. And then there is the horse that brings together all the cumulative innovation and compute contributions of a very large global community of academic researchers, developers, and enterprises. Which horse would be faster? Which would be more cost-efficient? Which one would you bet your business on as a developer or decision-maker? Which one would you bet on as an investor?\n\nI would bet on open-source outpacing closed-source AI every time.\n\nThe Future of AI is Bright! Let's Build It Together\n\nWhile there are several examples of complex technologies in modern history that were advanced better in open source than in closed source, the future of AI won't just fix itself — it needs everyone's help. The future of operating systems didn't fix itself: Linus Torvalds released Linux, and then the community joined in.\n\nAI needs its \"Linux\" moment to thrive: a complete open-source platform with all the required development tools propelled forward by the open community. Open-weight models developed in a silo by Meta2, DeepSeek, Alibaba, and others won't cut it. The three components (open data, open code, open weights), as identified by OSI, are not sufficient either. For AI to succeed, it also needs to have \"open collaboration\", and for that, AI needs a platform. Access to the data, code, and trained model is of limited value, if there is a barrier for others in the community to experiment, build upon it, and contribute.\n\nCollaboration must be the lifeblood of this \"Linux\" for AI. The ability to reproduce and build on top of others' contributions, across the full spectrum of frontier foundation model development, is a must. Collaboration needs to be the priority, or open source AI will fail to fulfill its promise.\n\nUntil now, the right AI collaboration didn't exist, so we started building a platform, Open Universal Machine Intelligence (Oumi), alongside academics from 13+ universities. We started building it to support foundation model research and to enable the community to effectively work together. The Oumi platform supports pre-training, tuning, data curation/synthesis, evaluation, and any other common utility, in a fully recordable and reproducible fashion, while being easily customizable to support novel approaches. It supports all common open models (Llama, QWEN, Phi, Mistral) and any platform, with seamless experiment transition from one's laptop to any cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP, Lambda) or on-prem cluster. Regardless of where you get your compute, you can still experiment together with anyone in the community and collaborate.\n\nWith the right AI collaboration platform in place, the community is enabled to develop foundational models collaboratively. We will be starting with the post-training of existing open models, which represent an excellent opportunity for the open community to advance the state of the art: sign up here if you are interested in participating. Next up will be collaboratively pursuing improvements to pre-training.\n\nFor AI to succeed, we can't work in silos. We need to all work together and be on the same team. If we work together, we will succeed, and open source AI will fulfill its promise. Every single organization and every single one of us will then greatly benefit. If not… well, let's just all make sure we build the right future for AI, together. The alternative is simply unacceptable.\n\nWhat future do we want for AI and what will we do about it?\n\nLet's start building it here… 🚀🚀🚀\n\n- Manos\n\nCEO, Oumi\n\n1 An Anthropic representative strongly suggested to me at AWS re:Invent (Dec' 24) that I don't need to train models and that curating a prompt is all I need. I can't overstate how wrong this self-serving argument is — note that Anthropic doesn't currently provide any tuning APIs.",

      "# [Customizing Oumi — Oumi](https://oumi.ai/docs/en/latest/user_guides/customization.html)\nCustomizing Oumi#\n\nOften times when using a new framework, you may find that something you’d like to use is missing. We always welcome contributions, but we also understand that sometimes it’s simpler to prototype changes locally. Whether you want to quickly experiment with new features, test out different implementation approaches, or iterate rapidly on your ideas without impacting the main codebase, Oumi provides a simple way to support local customizations without any additional installations.\n\nThe Oumi Registry#\n\nWe support customization via the oumi.core.registry.Registry.\n\nYou can easily register classes that are then loaded as if they’re a native part of the Oumi framework.\n\nSee the diagram below for how we load your custom code:\n\n%%{init: {'theme': 'base', 'themeVariables': { 'background': '#f5f5f5'}}}%% graph LR %% Oumi Framework FR[Oumi] --> |Read OUMI_EXTRA_DEPS_FILE| RQ[requirements.txt] %% Load Custom Files RQ --> |Import File| CF1[Custom Class 1 File] RQ --> |Import File| CF2[Custom Class 2 File] RQ --> |Import File| CF3[ ... ] %% Style for core workflow style FR fill:#1565c0,color:#ffffff style RQ fill:#1565c0,color:#ffffff style CF1 fill:#1565c0,color:#ffffff style CF1 fill:#1565c0,color:#ffffff style CF2 fill:#1565c0,color:#ffffff style CF3 fill:#1565c0,color:#ffffff\n\nYou can register your custom code in two simple steps:\n\nWriting a custom Model, Dataset, Cloud, etc\n\nCreating a requirements.txt file so your code is available via the CLI\n\nWriting Custom Classes#\n\nCustom Models#\n\nYou can easily customize models with oumi if something isn’t supported out of the box. We often hear requests for custom loss and custom model architectures: both are simple to implement via a custom model.\n\nCheck out our guide for an in-depth explanation: Custom Models\n\nNote\n\nDon’t forget to decorate your class with\n\n@registry.register(..., registry.RegistryType.MODEL)!\n\nCustom Datasets#\n\nCustom datasets are a great way to handle unique dataset formats that Oumi may not yet support.\n\nSee the following snippets for examples of custom datasets:\n\nCustom SFT Dataset\n\nCustom Pre-training Dataset\n\nCustom Preference Tuning Dataset\n\nCustom Vision-Language Dataset\n\nCustom Numpy Dataset\n\nNote\n\nDon’t forget to decorate your class with @register_dataset(...)!\n\nCustom Clouds/Clusters#\n\nAdding a custom cloud is perfect for handling local clusters not hosted by major cloud providers.\n\nFor example, we wrote a custom cloud for the Polaris platform. Our research team used this cloud to schedule jobs seamlessly on a remote super computer.\n\nTake a look at our custom cluster tutorial here.\n\nNote\n\nDon’t forget to decorate your class with @register_cloud_builder(...)!\n\nCustom Judge Configs#\n\nFor quick reference, you can register custom judge configs\n\nYou can find examples of custom judge configs here.\n\nNote\n\nDon’t forget to decorate your function with @register_judge(...)!\n\nEnable Your Classes for the CLI#\n\nIf you’re using Oumi as a python library, your custom classes will work out of the box! However, to use your custom classes from the Oumi CLI, you need to tell Oumi which files to load when initializing our Registry.\n\nTo do this, you must first create a requirements.txt file. This file has a simple structure: each line must be an absolute filepath to the file with your custom class / function (that you specified with the @register... decorator).\n\nFor example, if you created two custom classes in files /path/to/custom_cloud.py and /another/path/to/custom_model.py, your requirements.txt files should look like:\n\n/path/to/custom_cloud.py /another/path/to/custom_model.py\n\nWith your requirements.txt file created, you simply need to set the OUMI_EXTRA_DEPS_FILE environment variable to the location of your file, and you’re good to go!\n\nexportOUMI_EXTRA_DEPS_FILE=/another/path/requirements.txt",

      "# [Recipes — Oumi](https://oumi.ai/docs/en/latest/resources/recipes.html)\nRecipes#\n\nTo help you get started with Oumi, we’ve prepared a set of recipes for common use cases. These recipes are designed to be easy to understand and modify, and should be a good starting point for your own projects. Each recipe is a YAML file that can be used to train, evaluate, or deploy a model. We also have corresponding job configs for most recipes that let you run the job remotely; they’re usually files ending in _job.yaml in the same directory as the recipe config.\n\nOverview#\n\nThe recipes are organized by model family and task type. Each recipe includes:\n\nConfiguration files for different tasks (training, evaluation, inference)\n\nPlatform-specific job configurations (Cloud (e.g. GCP), Polaris, or local)\n\nMultiple training methods (FFT, LoRA, QLoRA, FSDP/DDP)\n\nTo use a recipe, simply download the desired configuration file, modify any parameters as needed, and run the configuration using the Oumi CLI. For example:\n\noumi train --config path/to/config.yaml oumi evaluate --config path/to/config.yaml oumi infer --config path/to/config.yaml\n\nYou can also check out the README.md in each recipe’s directory for more details and examples. You can easily adapt these recipes to use with other supported models, datasets, and cloud providers.\n\nCommon Models#\n\n🐋 DeepSeek R1 Family#\n\nModel\n\nConfiguration\n\nLinks\n\nDeepSeek R1

To configure, run either make setup, or:\n\npip install'.[dev]' pre-commit install\n\nThe pre-commit hooks will now be run before each commit. You can also run the hooks manually via:\n\npre-commit run# run all hooks on changed files pre-commit run --all-files# or, run all hooks on all files\n\nCode Formatting#\n\nOumi uses the ruff formatter for code formatting. These checks run through pre-commit (see section 1.2). These checks can also be run manually via:\n\npre-commit run ruff --all-files\n\nThe configuration is stored in pyproject.toml and .pre-commit-config.yaml.",

      "# [Out of Memory (OOM) — Oumi](https://oumi.ai/docs/en/latest/faq/oom.html)\nIntroduction#\n\nOut of Memory (OOM) errors are a common challenge when working with large language models and datasets.\n\nIn this guide, we will discuss a few strategies to reduce GPU memory requirements.\n\nBest Practices\n\nAlways monitor memory usage and performance metrics when applying these optimizations, using nvidia-smi and Oumi’s telemetry output.\n\nCombine multiple techniques for best results, but introduce changes gradually to isolate their effects.\n\nSome techniques may trade off speed and model accuracy for memory efficiency. Choose the right balance for your specific use case.\n\nDistributed Training with FSDP#\n\nIf you have access to multiple GPUs, you can leverage FSDP to distribute the training process across multiple GPUs. To run FSDP jobs, make sure to invoke your training job with torchrun to run on multiple GPUs/nodes. We also provide the oumi distributed wrapper to automatically try to set the flags needed for torchrun. For example, you can simply run oumi distributed torchrun -m oumi train -c path/to/train.yaml.\n\nEnable distributed training:\n\nPYTHON\n\nfromoumi.core.configsimport FSDPParams fromoumi.core.configs.params.fsdp_paramsimport ShardingStrategy config = TrainingConfig( fsdp=FSDPParams( enable_fsdp=True, sharding_strategy=ShardingStrategy.FULL_SHARD, ), )\n\nYAML\n\nfsdp: enable_fsdp:true sharding_strategy:FULL_SHARD\n\nEnable CPU offloading:\n\nPYTHON\n\nconfig = TrainingConfig( fsdp=FSDPParams( enable_fsdp=True, cpu_offload=True, ), )\n\nYAML\n\nfsdp: enable_fsdp:true cpu_offload:true\n\nDisable Forward Prefetch:\n\nPYTHON\n\nconfig = TrainingConfig( fsdp=FSDPParams( enable_fsdp=True, forward_prefetch=False, ), )\n\nYAML\n\nfsdp: enable_fsdp:true forward_prefetch:false\n\nDisable Backward Prefetch:\n\nPYTHON\n\nconfig = TrainingConfig( fsdp=FSDPParams( enable_fsdp=True, backward_prefetch=BackwardPrefetch.NO_PREFETCH, ), )\n\nYAML\n\nfsdp: enable_fsdp:true backward_prefetch:NO_PREFETCH\n\nAttention\n\nDisabling FSDP’s forward and backward prefetch can lead to significant slower training times, use with caution.",

      "# [Dev Environment Setup — Oumi](https://oumi.ai/docs/en/latest/development/dev_setup.html)\n3.1 [optional] Force all job configs to do Oumi editable install#\n\nIf you’re making changes to the Oumi codebase which you can’t test locally (ex. training of large 8B+ models), you can use the Oumi launcher to launch remote jobs on GPU clusters and test your changes there. By default, most Oumi configs in the configs directory install oumi from PyPI (i.e. pip install oumi). However, for the remote job to pick up your local changes, you need to install from your local copy of the repo (i.e. pip install -e .).\n\nTo automate this process, you can set the OUMI_FORCE_EDITABLE_INSTALL environment variable to \"true\". This experimental feature will automatically detect and modify oumi PyPI installs to instead install in editable mode from source using regex.\n\n4.1 Getting access to Llama#\n\nLlama models are gated on HF Hub. To gain access, sign the agreement on your desired Llama model’s Hub page. It usually takes a few hours to get access to the model after signing the agreement. There is a separate agreement for each version of Llama:\n\nLlama 2\n\nLlama 3\n\nLlama 3.1\n\nLlama 3.2\n\nLlama 3.3",
      "# [Installation — Oumi](https://oumi.ai/docs/en/latest/get_started/installation.html)\n1. Install from PyPI (Recommended)#\n\nTo prevent dependency conflicts, let’s start by creating a virtual environment. We’ll use venv below, but you are welcome to use the environment manager of your choice (conda, uvx, etc):\n\nLinux / MacOS\n\npython -m venv .env source .env/bin/activate\n\nWindows\n\npython -m venv .env .env/Scripts/activate\n\nOnce that’s done, you’re ready to install Oumi!\n\nTo install the latest stable version of Oumi, run:\n\npip install oumi\n\n3. Clone and Install#\n\nIf you want to contribute to Oumi or need the full source code, you can clone the repository and install it:\n\nSSH\n\ngit clone git@github.com:oumi-ai/oumi.git cd oumi pip install -e\".[dev]\"\n\nHTTPS\n\ngit clone https://github.com/oumi-ai/oumi.git cd oumi pip install -e\".[dev]\"\n\nFor more information on setting up your dev environment for contributing to Oumi, please see our dev setup guide.\n\nThe -e flag installs the project in “editable” mode. This means that changes made to the source code will be immediately reflected in the installed package without needing to reinstall it. This is particularly helpful when you’re actively developing features and want to test your changes quickly. It creates a link to the project’s source code instead of copying the files, allowing you to modify the code and see the effects immediately in your Python environment.",

But specific ones might die, and it's impossible to say who will be king when the dust settles.\n\nA few people called internet a fad in the 90s, it wouldn't last. It took the bubble to burst before we got something resembling what it is today. It's easy to forget that Internet wasn't something everyone was sold on. Smartphones isn't even 20 years old in its current shape.\n\nI see a lot of the things I saw in internets growth in AIs current growth. The random companies popping up and some failed quickly and some went on to become behemoths. There was no rhyme or reason which one did. Google launched their engine free of charge too. It just happened it was too good to not use. Google was lightning fast and somehow produced relevant search results. Altavista launched, become the biggest and essentially died in just 3 years span.\n\nAI in 2025 might not be that amazing, but I believe AI in 2035 will be nothing short of a revolution when we look back\n\n#### Comment ID ma15yzl with +18 score by [(alexandros87, Reddit, 2025-01-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1id95mm/exgoogle_apple_engineers_launch_unconditionally/ma15yzl/) (in reply to ID m9yqzgt):\nGreat points.\n\nTo use a video game analogy:\n\nWe're still in the 'space invaders' era of all this stuff.

      "# Post ID 1ioxatq: [D] We built GenAI at Google and Apple, then left to build an open source AI lab, to enable the open community to collaborate and build the next DeepSeek. Ask us anything on Friday, Feb 14 from 9am-12pm PT! with +159 score by [(koukoumidis, Reddit, 2025-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ioxatq/d_we_built_genai_at_google_and_apple_then_left_to/)\nProof: [https://imgur.com/a/kxiTTXP](https://imgur.com/a/kxiTTXP)\n\nTL;DR: Hi 👋 we’re Oumi, an AI lab that believes in an unconditionally open source approach–code, weights, training data, infrastructure, and collaboration—so the entire community can collectively push AI forward. We built a platform for anyone to contribute research in AI. Ask us anything about open source, scaling large models, DeepSeek, and what it takes to build frontier models, both inside and outside of big tech companies. Tell us what is working well in open source AI or what challenges you are facing. What should we work on together to improve AI in the open?\n\n\\-------------\n\nFor years, we worked at big tech (Google, Apple, Microsoft) leading efforts on GenAI models like Google Cloud PaLM, Gemini, and Apple’s health foundation models. We were working in silos and knew there had to be a better way to develop these models openly and collaboratively. So, we built a truly open source AI platform that makes it possible for tens of thousands of AI researchers, scientists, and developers around the world to collaborate, working together to advance frontier AI in a collective way that leads to more efficient, transparent and responsible development. The Oumi platform (fully open-source, Apache 2.0 license) supports pre-training, tuning, data curation/synthesis, evaluation, and any other common utility, in a fully recordable and reproducible fashion, while being easily customizable to support novel approaches.\n\nDeepSeek showed us what open source can achieve by leveraging open-weight models like LLaMA. But we believe AI should be even more open: not just the weights, but also the training data, and the code–make it ALL open. Then go even further: make it easy for anyone to access and experiment, make it easy for the community to work together and collaborate. \n\nSome resources about Oumi if you’re interested:\n\nOur GitHub repo: [https://github.com/oumi-ai/oumi](https://github.com/oumi-ai/oumi)\n\nOur launch story: [https://venturebeat.com/ai/ex-google-apple-engineers-launch-unconditionally-open-source-oumi-ai-platform-that-could-help-to-build-the-next-deepseek/](https://venturebeat.com/ai/ex-google-apple-engineers-launch-unconditionally-open-source-oumi-ai-platform-that-could-help-to-build-the-next-deepseek/)\n\nOur site: [https://oumi.ai/](https://oumi.ai/) \n\nIf you want to collaborate and contribute to community research projects, regardless of where you get your compute, you can sign up at: [https://oumi.ai/community](https://oumi.ai/community). We will be starting with the post-training of existing open models, next, we will be collaboratively pursuing improvements to pre-training. We intend to publish the research with all contributors included as authors.\n\nWe’re here to answer questions about our open source approach, scaling large models, DeepSeek, what it takes to build frontier models both inside and outside of big tech companies, and anything else you all want to discuss.\n\nWe’ll be here Friday, February 14 from 9am-12pm PT / 12pm-3pm ET.

Open source AI can be a pot that everyone contributes and then everyone benefits - it is the most efficient way to do this and how we can avoid the economics of OpenAI and other closed model providers. \n\nKeep us honest, and we’ll let our actions speak louder than our words :)\n\n#### Comment ID mcrzar4 with +17 score by [(fordat1, Reddit, 2025-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ioxatq/d_we_built_genai_at_google_and_apple_then_left_to/mcrzar4/) (in reply to ID mcrkemu):\n>This is not just a single organization (Oumi) effort, it is a community effort and it can only succeed as such.

Our goal with the [Oumi](https://github.com/oumi-ai/oumi/tree/main) platform is to support the full pipeline end-to-end, including pre-training with novel architectures. You can already do pre-training with small models (e.g., [GPT-2](https://github.com/oumi-ai/oumi/tree/main/configs/recipes/gpt2/pretraining) and [SmolLM](https://github.com/oumi-ai/oumi/tree/main/configs/recipes/smollm/sft/135m)), easily use most of the open pre-training datasets, and implement custom architectures (e.g., [NanoGPT](https://github.com/oumi-ai/oumi/blob/main/notebooks/Oumi%20-%20Using%20NanoGPT.ipynb)).\n\n2. xLSTM in particular is definitely on our radar. It's a great option for long-context inference, which is particularly useful these days with the extra-long context requirements of reasoning models and RAG.\n\nOverall, there is much more interest from the community in post-training. This is not only because it's more tractable computationally but also because post-training is often the best way to customize the model to your specific needs and use cases. That said, there is some great pre-training work being done in open source at manageable scale, for example, the[ GPT-2 speedruns by KellerJordan](https://github.com/KellerJordan/modded-nanogpt), and we'd love to help the community experiment more with pre-training and novel architectures.\n\n## Comment ID mcqtpnv with +8 score by [(AhmedMostafa16, Reddit, 2025-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ioxatq/d_we_built_genai_at_google_and_apple_then_left_to/mcqtpnv/) (in reply to ID 1ioxatq):\nIf you, Oumi, could change one thing about the AI research landscape today to make it more open and accessible, what would it be?\n\n### Comment ID mcre0jq with +8 score by [(koukoumidis, Reddit, 2025-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ioxatq/d_we_built_genai_at_google_and_apple_then_left_to/mcre0jq/) (in reply to ID mcqtpnv):\nWhat a great question! We really want this. We really want the development of frontier AI to be open and collaborative as this will help us advance AI faster, safer and more efficiently. I think that our best path to achieve this is and what we would like to “change” is that we all work together on the same platform while keeping everything open (data, code, models) to advance general foundation models together. At the same time, the work we do on such a platform should be community-first i.e. designed in a way to promote collaboration as a first class citizen making it easy for the community to build the work of others.\n\n## Comment ID mcqqja3 with +6 score by [(canofbeans3896, Reddit, 2025-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ioxatq/d_we_built_genai_at_google_and_apple_then_left_to/mcqqja3/) (in reply to ID 1ioxatq):\nHow’d u all meet and any specific experiences at your companies that drove you to want to build open source instead\n\n### Comment ID mcrocsz with +6 score by [(koukoumidis, Reddit, 2025-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ioxatq/d_we_built_genai_at_google_and_apple_then_left_to/mcrocsz/) (in reply to ID mcqqja3):\nWe all worked together at some point across multiple AI efforts including the development of PaLM, Gemini and even something like ChatGPT back in 2016 - we used LSTMs for generation and did RAG back then as well! :) \n\nWe all happened to share the same concerns about the status quo of frontier AI. It was not only problematic to put AI – our greatest invention yet – in a black box, but also highly inefficient to continue developing it like that. AI development should not be siloed-off.

Yes you do need bajillion GPUs for pre-training GPT-5, but most of the interesting research in the field IMO does not.\n\nYou can still innovate with minimal resources, for example: building datasets, evaluations, faster inference & training cuda/triton kernels, post-train models to perform better at targeted tasks, build verifiers for improved reasoning with GRPO, …\n\nIn general with the shift to reasoning models, the computational barriers are a lot lower for researchers than it is with pre-training.

One can use a sledgehammer to push a little nail through a wall, but this won’t be the most accurate or efficient way to do it! 🙂  \n  \nI have seen numerous scenarios in which smaller foundation models that have been customized to a certain task can have higher quality while at the same time being lower latency and cost than the big generic models. The same applies to domain based LLMs and LLMs that are specific to the internal knowledge of a specific organization - especially when that can’t be found on the public web.\n\n## Comment ID mcrni52 with +6 score by [(Relevant-Ad9432, Reddit, 2025-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ioxatq/d_we_built_genai_at_google_and_apple_then_left_to/mcrni52/) (in reply to ID 1ioxatq):\nI dont really understand the rationale behind 'open' AI, to me its still closed.

I personally think about this in two ways:\n\n1. While a model may be prohibitively large for most folks to run, the fact that it’s open means that everyone with access to sufficient compute can use it. This means that the model is available to all academic labs, research institutions, etc, and can be worked on collaboratively by the open source community. This prevents one large company from being the sole arbiter of how this model is created, how it acts, etc.  \n2. There’s always an ongoing effort to make these large models usable at a smaller scale (distillation and quantization, to name a few such methods). By making these large models open, folks can work on getting them to the scale where everyone can actually use them. Who wouldn’t want to have a great model like Deepseek 671B working on their phone? People are definitely working to make this happen.\n\n## Comment ID mcrkoxh with +4 score by [(DarthLoki79, Reddit, 2025-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ioxatq/d_we_built_genai_at_google_and_apple_then_left_to/mcrkoxh/) (in reply to ID 1ioxatq):\nHow interested are you in regards to a mech interp-driven approach to model debugging/development?

We have a few approaches that we’re kicking around for compute, but we’re also consistently applying for public research grants. Because we want to share our work publicly, we’re not limited to just raising funding at a company level. \n\n\n\nAt the same time, we don’t plan to compete as just a small company with $10M - for open source AI to succeed, it needs to be a community effort with everyone contributing expertise, compute and any resources they can share.  Everybody contributes so we can make better open source AI for everyone :)\n\n## Comment ID mcqrhnb with +2 score by [(canofbeans3896, Reddit, 2025-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ioxatq/d_we_built_genai_at_google_and_apple_then_left_to/mcqrhnb/) (in reply to ID 1ioxatq):\nAny advice for publishing AI research and what are some areas you think have potential but haven’t been studied yet/are understudied\n\n### Comment ID mcrmpqo with +7 score by [(oelachqar, Reddit, 2025-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ioxatq/d_we_built_genai_at_google_and_apple_then_left_to/mcrmpqo/) (in reply to ID mcqrhnb):\nThis may be a cop-out answer, but everything is at such an early stage in AI that there is low hanging fruit everywhere.

There are a few ways to work around this though:\n\n1. Publicly funded compute clusters tied to research (the US alone has multiple large accelerator clusters available for researchers to utilize under the premise that the results are shared openly).\n2. Alternative hardware/architectures - there’s ongoing research on avoiding matrix mults which can drastically speed up training and reduce memory footprint of models. I suspect there’s lots of gains to be made here that the larger corporations can't pursue because there’s no proven ROI, so it’s cheaper to let research figure it out first…\n3. (Crazier idea) Massively Distributed Training - there are instances of people being able to donate their computer’s hardware to scientific research, and while the current learning algorithms and architectures make this training model inefficient/infeasible, I think this idea has massive potential if it can be proven at a small scale.\n\n## Comment ID mcqgdeo with +2 score by [(eulasimp12, Reddit, 2025-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ioxatq/d_we_built_genai_at_google_and_apple_then_left_to/mcqgdeo/) (in reply to ID 1ioxatq):\nAny ideas so as to why any major ai generated image detection model has come forth?

It all depends on what we define as AGI.\n\nThere’s a few tiers, each of which has different degrees of “closeness”:\n\n1. AGI meaning AI can do most digital tasks as well as a human.\n   1. I suspect this one is not as far off as people might think, primarily because there’s a lot of digital tasks that are relatively easy. Digital assistant is by far the earliest and easiest use-case for AI at the moment.\n2. AGI meaning AI can do expert-level digital tasks as well as a human.\n   1. AI is not far from assisting in these tasks in some way, but actually performing as well as humans *generally* is still several years away, in part due to the variety of skills and mediums necessary to perform one’s job as a doctor, lawyer, scientist, etc. AI will definitely be integrated into these fields in the same way that computers have.\n3. AGI meaning “super intelligence” where it can do everything better than humans and starts improving itself (i.e. “the singularity”)\n   1. Self-learning is often the holy grail of AI, and while there are several instances of self-learning already at play (GRPO with DeepSeek R1), there’s not a scenario right now where an AI can be left to its own devices and it will magically improve. Getting higher quality data and improving training methodologies is hard! While we are at the stage where we can train AI to be better than humans in a variety of tasks, we’ve yet to train an AI to be better at improving AI, and that feels farther away, though I could see us seeing the beginnings of this in our lifetime.\n\nOutside of these there’s also the “physical world” aspect of robotics, which while it’s been improving it’s definitely farther off (20+ years) due to all the complexities involved in operating in the physical world rather than the digital one. After doing minor plumbing work in our house I’m fairly confident there will not be any robot plumbers for several decades!\n\n## Comment ID mcqpezt with +1 score by [(seatheroses, Reddit, 2025-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ioxatq/d_we_built_genai_at_google_and_apple_then_left_to/mcqpezt/) (in reply to ID 1ioxatq):\nSam Altman just admitted that OpenAI has been ‘on the wrong side of history’ when it comes to open source.

Sam Altman obviously has a responsibility to his employees, investors, and users to respond in some way.\n\nThat being said, I don’t anticipate them going fully open source. Even their most recent change which “reveals the thoughts behind the model” I suspect is actually just showing a summarized view of the thoughts rather than the thought traces themselves. Ultimately I just think OpenAI’s business and funding model would require a dramatic shift before they really get a strong open-source strategy.",

The unstoppable combination from days long past has finally made its triumphant return and appears to have made short work of Gunther and his army of science experiments gone wrong! With Prince Pola and The Witch being given a shot to redeem themselves in the future, our focus now shifts to a familiar face that left us all slack-jawed once we feasted our eyes upon his majestic new form... the draconic prodigy Ashuron is back, and he seems to have something to do with Gash's inspired plan to conquer the grave! So to whet our appetites for the release of the next installment in 2 days, let's all see what we can gush about until the day arrives! (Expect MAJOR spoilers from chapter 15, of course)\n\nOnly read this spoil-tagged text if you've seen the preview pages:  \n>!For #8, I do know all about the colored spread, so don't spoil it (or anything else from the preview) in the comments please!<\n\n1. Let's start with the question on EVERYONE'S mind... what is the story behind the enormous fortress and the fact that Ashuron appears to be rooted to his makeshift throne? Did he somehow grow his crimson scales throughout the entire region as a means of protection??\n2. How long did the events of most of this volume take? From the moment Gash tried to wake Kanchome until where we're at now, how long have Gash and Kiyomaro been gone? Will we get to catch up with Kanchome, Folgore, Consomme, Zelie, Olmo, and Mippy in this upcoming chapter... or will we have to wait a little longer for them to gain relevance again?\n3. Is Gunther down for the count, or will he have even more spells up his sleeve? Better yet... do you think he might call in reinforcements due to the king's arrival?\n4. Will Tio get to show off a new spell after all if Gunther is pushed to the point of desperation and unloads even more firepower on the group? Or will Gash be able to singlehandedly finish this guy off with his spells alone?\n5. Regardless of the outcome, the refugees will quickly need to relocate once Brelda gets wise to what's going on at the temple. But where will they even run to if that's the case?\n6. How long do we think that Gash, Kiyomaro, Tio, and Megumi will stay in the demon world? Once the refugees are safe, will they head back to the human world in an instant thanks to the spell books so that they can gather more of the original human partners? Or do we think they'll be sticking around a little bit longer so that Kiyomaro and Megumi can help us get some much-needed exposition?\n7. Did Ashuron actually fight for his life after losing his spells, or do we suppose he might have stayed behind and taken on the role of protector for the citizens of the fortress right away?\n8. Still no colored illustrations yet... the last one we received was all the way back in chapter SEVEN.... Raiku's back has been aching, but let's hope for a miracle here!\n9. Three characters who are strongly linked to Tio are Wonrei, Mars, and Momon. Wonrei seems to have a lot to do with Tio's natural transformation into a seasoned warrior... and Momon was teased in a New Years tweet this year since it's the Year of the Rabbit... lastly, a return from Mars at this point would be a story on its own because of how radically different he would have to be as a person, since we only last saw him antagonizing Tio with an evil mentality that he wouldn't possibly still subscribe to after everything that went down. So how likely do we think it will be for any of these three to appear in the sequel before Tio's volume draws to a close?\n10. While Gash and Kiyomaro are away, will Kanchome and Folgore be picking up the slack and heading over to Mochinoki City in search of even more familiar faces from Japan to help out the cause?

(OpenAI, Google, Open Source) with +164 score by [(mimirium_, Reddit, 2025-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jbrwqf/deep_research_tools_am_i_the_only_one/)\nHey everyone,\n\nI've been diving headfirst into these \"Deep Research\" AI tools lately - OpenAI's thing, Google's Gemini version, Perplexity, even some of the open-source ones on GitHub. You know, the ones that promise to do all the heavy lifting of in-depth research for you. I was so hyped!\n\nI mean, the idea is amazing, right? Finally having an AI assistant that can handle literature reviews, synthesize data, and write full reports? Sign me up! But after using them for a while, I keep feeling like something's missing.\n\nLike, the biggest issue for me is accuracy. I’ve had to fact-check so many things, and way too often it's just plain wrong. Or even worse, it makes up sources that don't exist! It's also pretty surface-level. It can pull information, sure, but it often misses the whole context. It's rare I find truly new insights from it. Also, it just grabs stuff from the web without checking if a source is a blog or a peer reviewed journal. And once it starts down a wrong path, its so hard to correct the tool.\n\nAnd don’t even get me started on the limitations with data access - I get it, it's early days. But being able to pull private information would be so useful!\n\nI can see the potential here, I really do. Uploading files, asking tough questions, getting a structured report… It’s a big step, but I was kinda hoping for a breakthrough in saving time. I am just left slightly unsatisfied and wishing for something a little bit better.\n\nSo, am I alone here? What have your experiences been like? Has anyone actually found one of these tools that nails it, or are we all just beta-testing expensive (and sometimes inaccurate) search engines?\n\nTL;DR: These \"Deep Research\" AI tools are cool, but they still have accuracy issues, lack context, and need more data access. Feeling a bit underwhelmed tbh.\n\n## Comment ID mhwhc2n with +98 score by [(Banjo-Katoey, Reddit, 2025-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jbrwqf/deep_research_tools_am_i_the_only_one/mhwhc2n/) (in reply to ID 1jbrwqf):\nI've used a few of the deep research tools. You're absolutely right that something is missing. What we have now is essentially a thorough summary of a long CoT.\n\n\nA few things are missing. They don't know how to weight sources properly, like they don't go and download a government budget pdf and read it if I ask a question about the budget for example. It will just use a bunch of sources commenting on the budget.\n\n\nAnother thing that's missing is agentic behavior. It needs to be able to interact with, not just read, websites. For example I should be able to ask for all of my Internet service provider options if I give it my address. The LLM should go to every ISP website and check. We have similar issues with real estate websites, car rentals, plane tickets, etc. \n\n\nAnd deep research needs to be able to run python code (including with Internet access) and simulate things.\n\n\nHonestly once these 3 things are fixed we're so back.\n\n### Comment ID mhxczvb with +18 score by [(Taenk, Reddit, 2025-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jbrwqf/deep_research_tools_am_i_the_only_one/mhxczvb/) (in reply to ID mhwhc2n):\nThere is also a lack of contextual reasoning. This is particularly noticeable in cases where the field is evolving rapidly: More current sources should be weighed more strongly, but from the LLM's POV all content has equal weight.\n\nI speculate that the next iteration of deep research needs a combination of\n\n* tool use, to run analysis against data it found, or use search functions on websites it is fed\n* source understanding and source control to have at least a baseline of quality\n* thinking/reasoning to make more use of the knowledge it already has in its weights\n\nDeep research makes its next leap when a tool like Claude Code can leverage deep research to read the documentation of a completely new library (like the recently released Tauri) and immediately start using start using that library.\n\nMaybe an architectural change will be necessary beyond just more training. For me personally, a driving factor for more research and critical thinking is \"I don't know ...\" and \"I am unsure ...\", both of which the current generation of LLMs struggle with, as they have no introspection.\n\n### Comment ID mhwuiiv with +3 score by [(XInTheDark, Reddit, 2025-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jbrwqf/deep_research_tools_am_i_the_only_one/mhwuiiv/) (in reply to ID mhwhc2n):\nAgree! Hope someone working on these projects will take note of these big areas for improvement. OpenAI definitely has the biggest lead because of the intelligence of its o3 model. But honestly other foundation models (R1 specifically!) should be more than enough to perform competent research. \n\nGenerally I’d say this can be summarized into “more agentic capabilities”, which in itself is a vague term and is certainly being worked on, but I think it’s more of being able to combine existing functionalities: computer/browser use, code interpreter, etc. \n\nIn fact, just learning how to use the browser properly will make deep research so much more effective; it’s basically an intelligent human researcher at that point.\n\n#### Comment ID mhwyb9z with +2 score by [(Banjo-Katoey, Reddit, 2025-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jbrwqf/deep_research_tools_am_i_the_only_one/mhwyb9z/) (in reply to ID mhwuiiv):\nAgreed - I also think intelligence is already sufficient in o3.

So in the same way that an intern today might be told to “go Google it” for simple questions they don’t have answers to, in the future they’ll be asked to “go Deep Research it” for moderately difficult questions they don’t have answers to. \n\nFrom a national / industrial perspective, this is actually incredibly powerful, as raising the minimum competency is a tremendous multiplier on productivity. But for the average person, the value is no different from Google search back in the day. You’ll be expected to use it but it won’t automate your job, it’ll just mean you can’t get away with less any more. \n\nThis is actually the insight that Google and many Chinese companies realized but Anthropic and Open AI are still struggling to understand. AI is like search, it’ll become normalized and as with any normalized tool, people will expect it to be free*. No one is going to pay $2000/month or even $200/month for a technology that’s really about raising the minimum competency for a country. There’s just not enough personal value/advantage gained. Consequently the only way forward is free* AI, by which I mean you become the product but the service is free*.\n\n### Comment ID mi398ti with +3 score by [(InsideYork, Reddit, 2025-03-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jbrwqf/deep_research_tools_am_i_the_only_one/mi398ti/) (in reply to ID mhwqve0):\nThe problem is that it’s full of giant errors and bad reasoning.

We can basically wait six months for updates that do things faster, cheaper, with broader applications for various failure modes.

I kind of treat it like an underling doing your research for you. You still want to be able to understand what it’s producing, and double check its findings. Imagine your submitting a study to an academic journal. You still want to spend the time and double check all the facts. \n\nIn terms of quality, I think it entirely depends on context and what you ask the AI to do. I got really impressive results with those this prompt I just used to research pharmacogenetics in ADHD:\n\n You will act as an expert medical researcher specializing in pharmacogenetics. Your task is to write a comprehensive and detailed graduate-level 15-page research paper on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a disorder influenced by both genetic and environmental components. The paper should adhere to AMA formatting guidelines, with each section approximately 2-3 double-spaced pages (target word count: 4,500 - 5,000 words total). \n\r\nThis research paper should heavily emphasize pharmacogenetics and its impact on ADHD—specifically focusing on how pharmacogenetic insights influence diagnosis, treatment, and patient care strategies. Broader genetic and environmental factors should provide context but always anchor back to their pharmacogenetic relevance.\r\n\r\nThe paper must include the following sections:\r\n\r\n- A thorough discussion of the etiology of ADHD, integrated with pharmacogenetic considerations\r\n- An in-depth explanation of the fundamental biology behind ADHD, linking molecular pathways to pharmacogenetic targets\r\n- An analysis of the specific genes involved in ADHD, highlighting their role in pharmacogenetic treatment response, alongside candidate susceptibility genes\r\n- A review of the basic epidemiology of ADHD, covering prevalence, demographics, and risk factors, with connections to pharmacogenetic findings\r\n- An examination of environmental factors contributing to the etiology of ADHD and how these interact with genetic and pharmacogenetic variables\r\n- A critical exploration of an ELSI (Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications) issue that has emerged from pharmacogenetic research or the clinical application of pharmacogenomics in ADHD treatment\r\n\r\nAdditionally, incorporate recent pharmacogenomic trends and emerging research (within the last 5 years), including gene-drug response case studies where applicable. Aim to cite approximately 10-15 references, prioritizing primary research articles and reviews from peer-reviewed journals.\r\n\r\nThe paper should reflect my communication style:\r\n- Logical, clever, and analytically sharp\r\n- Concise, critical, and purposeful\r\n- Occasional, sparing use of dry or dark humor to sharpen key insights\r\n- Accessible yet deeply analytical, with no unnecessary filler\r\n\r\nThe tone should maintain scientific rigor while being engaging and thoughtfully critical, delivering complex pharmacogenetic concepts with clarity and precision.\n\n## Comment ID mi3rmpc with +1 score by [(DarkVoid42, Reddit, 2025-03-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jbrwqf/deep_research_tools_am_i_the_only_one/mi3rmpc/) (in reply to ID 1jbrwqf):\nthe only thing those tools deep research is how to extract money out of your wallet.\n\n## Comment ID miomki7 with +1 score by [(arg_max, Reddit, 2025-03-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jbrwqf/deep_research_tools_am_i_the_only_one/miomki7/) (in reply to ID 1jbrwqf):\nThe issue are the base models.

So people got bored and noticed a pattern while the once we mentioned are spaced out and didn’t  have their quest right after each other.\n\nBut you are completely right their only similarities is of course if you reduce them to one character trait it’s however glaringly obvious if the writers of the event also focus on only one of their character traits. Hence the critic wasn’t really none sensical. \nIt was just not the best writing for Kokomi story quest.\n\n## Comment ID lq3hqby with +23 score by [(Sun_Wukong508, Reddit, 2024-10-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1fuzckb/character_introduction_ardent_flames_forge_the/lq3hqby/) (in reply to ID 1fuzckb):\nso how long before we get flooded with videos of her DJ'ing while other characters dance?\n\n## Comment ID lq3a3ma with +50 score by [(elbenji, Reddit, 2024-10-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1fuzckb/character_introduction_ardent_flames_forge_the/lq3a3ma/) (in reply to ID 1fuzckb):\nblessed OP as fuck ocelotl\n\n### Comment ID lq3nk21 with +10 score by [(pcrackenhead, Reddit, 2024-10-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1fuzckb/character_introduction_ardent_flames_forge_the/lq3nk21/) (in reply to ID lq3a3ma):\nHer constellation naming is confusing because it implies she’s an Ocelot, but it also has Panthera in the name, which is the cat family that includes Leopards and Jaguars.\n\n#### Comment ID lq3omje with +29 score by [(Quality-hour, Reddit, 2024-10-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1fuzckb/character_introduction_ardent_flames_forge_the/lq3omje/) (in reply to ID lq3nk21):\nOcelotl was also the name for members of an Aztec warrior elite, which means \"Jaguar Warrior.\" The word also generally referred to jaguars more than ocelots in Nahuatl.\n\n#### Comment ID lq4hbll with +11 score by [(elbenji, Reddit, 2024-10-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1fuzckb/character_introduction_ardent_flames_forge_the/lq4hbll/) (in reply to ID lq3nk21):\nOcelotl - Jaguar \n\nConfusing I know\n\n#### Comment ID lq3o9zf with +7 score by [(glittermetalprincess, Reddit, 2024-10-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1fuzckb/character_introduction_ardent_flames_forge_the/lq3o9zf/) (in reply to ID lq3nk21):\nRight?

I hope people would check it despite the kind of story that it has, because from what i read of it, it has the potential to be really great.\n\n[Viki](https://www.viki.com/tv/38837c-eternal-yesterday#episodes) \\- The series will air on Viki as well, but after checking it, it seems the eps will become available one day later than in GagaOOLala. This is a bit weird since it never happened until now for a MBS drama, but it is what it is.\n\n[GagaOOLala](https://www.gagaoolala.com/en/videos/3038/eternal-yesterday-2022-e08)\n\n**Synopsis**: \"Koichi, who is cheerful and popular in the class, and Mitsuru, who is talented and not good at socializing. The two high school students are strongly attracted to each other due to their opposite personalities. However, one morning, Koichi is hit by a truck in front of Mitsuru. Koichi got up on the spot and smiled as usual, and although he was indeed \"alive\", his classmates gradually began to forget about Koichi's existence.\"- MDL\n\n**The series has a total of 8 eps. It airs on: Fridays.**\n\n[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUKLUlcVXBw)\n\n[MDL](https://mydramalist.com/737611-eien-no-kino)\n\nThe OST for this series is insanely good. They just have to break our hearts all the way, ahhhhh. Those are the official links for the songs:\n\nAoi Kubo \"Eternal\"[https://youtu.be/YlshfPY4kNM](https://youtu.be/YlshfPY4kNM)\n\nAyumu Imazu \"Sunshower\" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4QRG7Xdszk&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4QRG7Xdszk&feature=youtu.be)\n\nWe are at the last ep already. I hope people enjoy this until the end, and i hope to see you all in the Ameiro Paradox  on air thread, which will take place at the same time, because is the series that will replace Eternal Yesterday and the last MBS BL series for the year. MBS thought this well by making and releasing a really well made and hilarious romcom after Eternal Yesterday because i think is something we all need to make us feel better after this final. Gagaoolala released the teaser for Ameiro paradox with Eng subs. \n\nI hope everyone who are hesitating to watch this will try to give it a chance because even through it\\`s not easy to watch all the time, is extremely well made which can compensate  a lot of things in my opinion. This is one of the best acted BL series and the one that has the best chemistry among all MBS BL series, even surpassing the one from Utsukushii Kare ( i am giving this to them hahaha). Everyone who waited to binge watch it, please do so as well and join the ON AIR thread. I hope people will look forward for my usual poll that i will make for it next week as well.\n\nEDIT. I just found out that the DVD/Bluray of the series will be released in 12. 05. 2023.\n\n## Comment ID izhmar2 with +54 score by [(bonkersbrad, Reddit, 2022-12-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/boyslove/comments/zglzpd/eternal_yesterday_ep8_finale/izhmar2/) (in reply to ID zglzpd):\nOmg!!!! 🥺🥺😭😭\n\nAs sad as it was… that was done so *delicately*. \n\nThe way Koichi broke down whilst holding onto Mitsuru 🥺🥺🥺🥺 and Mitsuru knew he just had to accept the truth and comfort Koichi even though he was in tremendous pain himself.

I actually thnk that the relationship between them is close enough and memorable considering the circumstances. His father is as complex and interesting as Mitsuru, would have liked to know more about what happened in the past. It might be because he is really pleasant to look at and  a really fascinating character. He looks like a more wise, experienced and composed version of Mitsuru.\n\nI am wondering if this is because his father has noticed that some people can\\`t see Koichi or for picking up something that we didn\\`t noticed.\n\n![gif](giphy|xUA7aZhmzXeCXq80Hm)\n\nIt become one if my favorites as well\n\n### Comment ID izhqktv with +9 score by [(Ok_Task9451, Reddit, 2022-12-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/boyslove/comments/zglzpd/eternal_yesterday_ep8_finale/izhqktv/) (in reply to ID izhmar2):\nI could not agree more!!\n\n## Comment ID izhkv77 with +44 score by [(smittenkittyyan, Reddit, 2022-12-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/boyslove/comments/zglzpd/eternal_yesterday_ep8_finale/izhkv77/) (in reply to ID zglzpd):\nLet\\`s cry together and let everything out.

There are a few people in this sub who has made  posts sharing the DVS/BLURAY they bought.\n\nIn Japan, almost all movies are released in DVD/Bluray as well, after it finishes screening in cinema. I saw a lot of non-JBL popular series being released this way as well, and people suport the works by buying them. Lately all japanese BLs are released in Bluray/DVD as well.\n\nI mentioned this before, but in Japan, how well the DVD/BLURAY of a series or movie does is used as a criteria to decide if a continuation will be made, being as a  movie sequel or second season ( movie sequels are more common for Japan). Cherry magic, Utsukushii Kare had really good sells in DVD/Bluray, and this is why a  continuation has materialised.\n\nThis is not the only criteria, but this is the reason why all japanese BL series are released in DVD/BLURAY as well.

What i was worried and curious at the same time is how they would explain why all this happened and how they would present Koichi death. \n\nLike i mentioned in my previous post, i was really happy and relieved to see that they addressed and handled all this stuff as best as they could in a way that it didn\\`t take away from the story between Koichi and Mitsuru. I personally think that the reason why Koichi was able to be a living corpse temporarily was related to Mitsuru and is probably something that is related to his family, as his father experienced the same thing with Mitsuru\\`s mother. But, did you noticed that Tamaki sensei has most likely remembered Koichi as well ( when he was a living corpse), so there is something there that suggests that is not only related to Mitsuru.\n\nI really liked how they have chosen to retell a part of the story from Koichi pov at the very end. It  remembers me of Utsukushii Kare, and it makes me proud hahaha. \n\nThis is definitely my favorite BL that has a sad ending, because all the other sad BL/LGBTQ works that i watched had an ending that was tragically or unnecessary sad. \n\nGlad both you and Mew has end up liking this series and didn\\`t ended up regretting watching it.

Whoa, the dude who plays Mit-chan is PHENOMENAL. This is how a cold, distant-type character should be played. He's proof that the actor doesn't need to be a statue to get his personality across to the audience. He did more quality acting with the top of his head after Koichi yelled at him while camping than when many other actors have the opportunity to use their whole faces.\n\nI knew it would only be a matter time before Koichi broke down after reassuring Mit-chan for seven episodes. That dude sounded like he was doing actual gut wailing, which made me feel slightly bad for Mit-chan's eardrum since Koichi was so close. But, holy crow, he especially brought his A-game in that scene.\n\nSo much happened in this series in such a short time. Tears, ears, and fears galore! Japan came in hot with the constant touching of the constantly shirtless dude, unique plot, and life-giving (assumed) BJ. What a reverse bait and switch after the dead fish lips! 😍\n\nUnfortunately, the show runners thought a life lesson was more important than a HEA—those silly gooses.

This is how a cold, distant-type character should be played. He's proof that the actor doesn't need to be a statue to get his personality across to the audience.\n\nYes. **Inoue Sora**  is  a phenomenal actor indeed. I noticed how charming, nuanced and consistent Mitsuru is portrayed. Like you\\`ve said,  cold and unapproachable characters can be tricky to play and most of the time are portrayed as being really unidimensional and really boring to look at to be honest. Those characters are usually hard to play in general from what i observed. In my opinion, the ideal is for the crew  to cast someone who can naturally portray this kind of character because this is something the actor is good at or to cast a really talented and experienced actor.    \n**Inoue Sora**  did really really well with Mitsuru, at the level of an experienced actor and he doesn\\`t have that much acting experience. \n\nSomeone had to put at stop to avoiding discussing the inevitable, and i knew Koichi will end up opening the discussion and finally express all his pent up emotions, because unlike Mitsuru, Koichi is the type to keep it in until he would break down or venting his thoughts in an impulsive  and hard way. \n\n**About the sad ending,** stories like this has to be told as well and the production team didn\\`t changed the story from the novel at all. Like most other japanese BL adaptations, this one sticked to  the source material in a really high degree. Someone probably wanted to adapt a story that is more different to add something different to the mix of the MBS BL series for this year**. I think the reason they decided to do this is because they could afford it considering all the other BL series they released this year that has a happy ending. I am sure that if the series wasn\\`t for MBS or if MBS didn\\`t released so many other BLs that assured that everyone will find their favorite they wouldn\\`t adapt this. It was most likely decided to adapt this kind of story as well from the the planning phase.**\n\nAbout the bruising not being there anymore, i have no idea as well. My guess is that his wounds probabably started healing when he gets hot and turned on, But it sounds a bit....let\\`s say i have not idea. \n\n![gif](giphy|M90mJvfWfd5mbUuULX)\n\n#### Comment ID izploqd with +3 score by [(SkyeNoTongueNotaKiss, Reddit, 2022-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/boyslove/comments/zglzpd/eternal_yesterday_ep8_finale/izploqd/) (in reply to ID izpduya):\n>Like most other japanese BL adaptations, this one sticked to  the source material in a really high degree.\n\nMy comment was only half-serious. 😁 If it's a BL with a supernatural plot, then I know that a HEA is never a guarantee.

I’m so sad to see this series end. The beautiful acting, touching music, and poignant scenes. \n\nAs much as I wished for some sort of happy ending, this ending had to be one of the most beautifully done ones. The first episode of the show really set my expectations high and this episode tied it all together. \n\nI’m grateful we also saw things from Koichi’s perspective, saw him break down, and heard him have the last line. \n\nThe show truly is a metaphor about letting go of the ones you loved the most, and the acting of the cast really helped heighten that lesson. It also shows how it’s not an easy thing to accomplish. \n\nHonestly the only negative I see is, that while I loved the tender moment between Oumi and his dad, I was hoping his dad would hug him and not shake his head like a puppy lol. Maybe a hug would have been awkward.\n\nThis hurts, and it is sad. But the show, particularly the first and last episode, are so beautifully done. The love the two showed feels so real and eternal, and one thing the show and actors portrays is that is better to have loved and lose the one you loved, than to not experience that type of love at all.\n\n### Comment ID izq4kj2 with +4 score by [(smittenkittyyan, Reddit, 2022-12-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/boyslove/comments/zglzpd/eternal_yesterday_ep8_finale/izq4kj2/) (in reply to ID izhyfxb):\nIt was surely such a unique journey.

As much as I agree with u/momopeach7 that it would have been nice for Mitsuru to receive that affection, neither he nor his Dad were in an emotional place where that felt normal for them.\n\nHowever, having made a connection over being able to see Koichi, and explaining that it had been the same for both of them when Mitsuru's mother died (even if Mitsuru perhaps did not understand that's what was happening then), I think they will be able to build a stronger and more loving bond. \n\nParticularly since Koichi brought him into seeing how a more close knit family looks, though the Oumi family are never likely to be quite like that.\n\n## Comment ID izlu202 with +13 score by [(smittenkittyyan, Reddit, 2022-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/boyslove/comments/zglzpd/eternal_yesterday_ep8_finale/izlu202/) (in reply to ID zglzpd):\nIt\\`s time for me to express my opinion about this series.\n\nIt made me cry, it actually made me cry, i can\\`t believe it made me cry. Even through i use crying gifs or emojis to express how much something affect me or to comfort other people, i rarely cry while watching series and movies, but this one managed to make me cry. The fact that i cried revealed how much the series touched me.\n\nWell i haven\\`t cried so much to the point that i couldn\\`t stop and i was all i mess, but it was a good cry. I remember that the  only ones that has give me such a big cry that i was frustrated that i couldn\\`t stop myself from crying was the korean movie Night Flight and the japanese movie Dangerous drugs of sex. I do need a good cry from time to time, so i hope the movie Egoist will do the trick as well.\n\nI think the reason this ep and series feels more personal than the other eps and other BLs that i watched until now **is that i still remember very well how hard is to lose someone close, how hard is to handle the very first days when someone close to you dies and how overwhelming everything is**. As not to make this reply too sad, i will not get into details, but last year a very close relative of mine passed away and i remember how vulnerable and a mess i was back then and how much i cried in the day of the funeral. **Having someone close die will make a mess out of everyone, and i was touched to the core that Mitsuru reaction of having to face that Koichi is indeed dead and face the aftermath of it finally was so realistic. The way Mitsuru breaks down on the day Koichi disappears once an for all ( in the scene with his father) was  so realistic and it remembered me of my messy and ugly crying face back then. In my opinion, the way Mituru cries requires really high acting skills and there aren\\`t many japanese actors that can cry in such a heartbreaking way.**\n\nI have written before of how i really like the way Mitsuru was written and portrayed to be really consistent to his character all the time, even through his cold and closed off attitude might not get him any favors or in this case get many viewers to like him, hahahha. His character resemble so much of many other people i know in my life, same with Koichi. Ahhh, they make such a perfect couple.\n\nI want to see more characters like this in BL in general and not only in JBLs. JBLs are known to have really unique and well written characters, but i still wish that the amount of well written characters will increase even more  in JBLs every  new year.\n\nI want to point out some things that i found refreshing in the way the story unveiled.\n\n* The discussion our boys had before having sex, with Koichi saying that **it\\`s my first time**, followed by Mitsuru reply that, **its the first time for me too, so what?** , made me laugh so hard because of the nonchalant and cold way Mitsuru said it. I  am not used for a character to give such a nonchalant answer like that, not in BL ( not even in manga) and not coming across in such a way, God, this has been refreshing. This is somethIng that i could picture Mitsuru might say, but the way the lines are written to make sense all the time never fails to amaze me in this series.\n* I really appreciated that Koichi death was handled in such a smooth and caring  way,  being considerent of the viewers. This is how sad japanese movies are (especially the ones revolving around death),  they make you cry by tugging at your heartstrings with the writing but will rarely show too personal stuff that it\\`s meant to provoke unnecessary pain or trauma.  Koichi saying his goodbye in silence before returning to his dying place to die once and for all is such a touching scene and it gives such a positive message. **I am also surprised that the explanation of why Koichi has become this way and has not died directly make sense in a fantastic way. This is most likely something related to Mitsuru and his father, because both of them has experienced something like this with their partners.**\n* When i saw that scene in which Koichi was surprised that he likes a guy and that he is okay with it because he would like Mitsuru even if he was a girl, i was like, **not another one doing this bullshit?????,** but then seeing Koichi recognising that his thought is not really right because if he is a girl he will be not longer  Mitchan was so refreshing to hear. Thank you Japan for always try to stay away from cliche stuff as much as you can, i am always grateful.\n\nI personally don\\`t know if i will ever be able to rewatch  this series because some scenes hit too close to home but i will definitely listen to the songs for it, watch FMVs and rewatch some parts of it. Because rewatch value is important to me when i rank my favorite BLs, i decided that both More than words and To my star are safe for now, even Pornographer, but this BL will always remain one of my favorite and one of the few BLs that made me cry, which is a great feat.\n\n**That being said, i become a fan of both main actors and i will follow them from now on, they are really great actors and hope they will only get more and more popular in the future.**\n\nI want to congratulate the director and all the staff members in charge of this one for bringing this masterpiece and most likely one of a kind BL and series for us to see. I was really impressed by the cinematography ( which is similar with top tier movies) and the songs chosen. Most of the scenes are so beautiful and is because of them that i will want to recheck this BL from time to time. Like Purple has replied to someone else before, i am also one of the few people in the sub that tends to check ot rewatch a series or movie because of the great cinematography, direction, acting, basically the technical stuff.\n\nI consider this to be one of the most memorable scene i saw in a japanese BL and is my favorite from the series.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j7dwh7zxe05a1.jpeg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f2b8d896db929d21bd2e0acb0375215087ec193\n\nIt\\`s getting really late for me, so i will answer everyone replies tomorrrow.

I wasn't sure how I felt about this little gem while bw it. Especially in the first four episodes. Only in the final episodes did I feel more connected to the story and realise how brilliantly done this little gem is!\n\nNot gonna lie I was sobbing throughout the final. Them saying they are each other number one. The much needed father son conversation. The revelation of Micchan mom being a living corpse as well. I didn’t see that one coming. The fact that Koichi was raised by his uncle’s family like he was their own was so beautiful!\n\nIn a previous episode Micchan said when they kissed Koichi’s lips felt warm. However when they were in bed getting ready to “do it” all I could think about was how Micchan could hug Koichi cold body.\n\nIt’s not a series for the light hearted amongs us but if you don’t mind I’d definitely say give it a go.

The fact that Koichi was raised by his uncle’s family like he was their own was so beautiful!\n\nAll of those scenes took me by surprise as well,  added depth to the story and made the last ep really impactful.\n\n**Koichi body should be hot and not cold when they did it**, because is the same case as in ep 4, Koichi **got hot and  turned on** as a result of getting excited ( don\\`t ask me why, my guess is because of the fantastical stuff doing their magic).\n\nIf you remember the first few seconds of ep 8, Koichi said that he was hot and to me it looked like he is really hot and didn\\`t do it to break the ice. If you look closely he looked down at some point while staying in bed with his back turned and looked bothered.  Like in the novel, i think that Koichi was the top in the end, so he had to be ready and turned on hahaha.\n\nThis series will always be my favorite for completely different reasons than my other favorite BLs, which is a feat on it\\`s own.\n\n## Comment ID izp2iqi with +3 score by [(Beyond_Whole, Reddit, 2022-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/boyslove/comments/zglzpd/eternal_yesterday_ep8_finale/izp2iqi/) (in reply to ID zglzpd):\nI am very impressed overall it's was a soild adpatation of the novel.

Will come back after to share my thoughts. I didn't have time to watch it before due to finals.\n\nEDIT: I have a lot of thoughts. But basically that was one of the best BLs I have watched. It was so well done! The story is executed so well. It starts light and easy, then it slowly builds up through each episode. It keeps the same light atmosphere yet the tension gets stronger in each episode. Throughout the series, you can see that Mitsuru is in denial. When he finally admits to himself that Kochi will be gone, he breaks down and yet at the same time he tries to be strong so that he can comfort Kochi.\n\nTheir \"goodbye\" is heartbreaking yet so beautiful. I couldn't think of a better way to have ended it. I also really like how Mitsuru was able to connect with his dad on this, and has also been in touch with his friends from high school. He needed someone to be there for him after what happened. Also it was important for him to know why his mom did not want to show her love and affection for him. Although that was hard on Mitsuru, I feel that it was harder for his mother to do that to her child. It was a selfless act as everyone wants to be remembered when they're gone. However, his mother wanted to spare him from that pain. It was a sad ending, but sometimes you need to have a sad ending in order to accept and learn from certain values in life. There is so much depth and connection to this story, I want to write more about it, but it will turn out to be an essay if I go on.\n\nSeriously this is one of the best BL series.

Making sure it doesn\\`t gets too deep or heavy so the viewers are able to handle it. \n\nAs someone who has watched many extremely sad and tragic BL/LGBTQ works over the years, this one feel really easy to handle. \n\nI was so relieved that Mitsuru connected with his father because he really needed it at this time. I  was also happy that his conversation with his father has brought him the answers he has searched for and at the same time, it has also explained most of the things that needed to be told.\n\nI didn\\`t expected that it will tie everything so well together being how complex this series is,  really one of the best BL made. \n\nNo one of my most favorite BL, but one of my favorites nevertheless.\n\n### Comment ID izsjknn with +2 score by [(smittenkittyyan, Reddit, 2022-12-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/boyslove/comments/zglzpd/eternal_yesterday_ep8_finale/izsjknn/) (in reply to ID izre8wo):\nIf you didn\\`t noticed, this series has the most comments among all the On Air threads that i was in charge until now.

If you want accessible information in English, read or watch anything from Milton Santos on Latin American urban culture and heritage. He’s a Brazilian anthropologist but he has studied and produced different material for several other countries, i believe his insight will be more valuable than my comment. Central and South America are huge musical and cultural hotspots of urban art and techno music. Just check Funk, Reggaeton, Corrido, who are currently trendy. Some huge festivals are held here for decades with those style before they became mainstream, so this more urban themed graffiti style with the vibrant colours are very fitting to our culture as well.

Mualani is fine with her animations (and even then she is quite pushing it) and all the rest just screams like some other game. It quite literally doesn't fit the game's style.\n\nIt's like somebody from ZZZ design team decided to add his vision of the game into Genshin. Same goes to the latest drip marketing for HSR where that character is just like over the top \"modern\" or something. It's like if we added electricity into Game of Thrones. Even if it is logical and looks cool, it just doesn't fit the theme and the design of the game.\n\nSomeone might say that I'm the \"old man yelling at the cloud\" or something, but a lot of people would agree that it just ain't it.  \nAnd now I'm very scary for Mavuika/Capitano/other characters from Natlan because if they're gonna follow the theme, jinkies.\n\n### Comment ID lkdr7vu with +23 score by [(distantshallows, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/comments/1f3ecu7/51_beta_xilonen_animations_via_dim/lkdr7vu/) (in reply to ID lkd8sce):\n>HSR where that character is just like over the top \"modern\" or something.\n\n\nI don't agree about Genshin but I can understand your perspective, but HSR is literally a scifi setting where they hop between planets\n\n### Comment ID lke4di4 with +18 score by [(Independent-Room-479, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/comments/1f3ecu7/51_beta_xilonen_animations_via_dim/lke4di4/) (in reply to ID lkd8sce):\nI agree, however I was willing to overlook most of those things tbh and was super excited for Natlan, even if some stylistic choices didn't cater to me personally. The animations are still excellent at least.\n\nHowever after actually playing it I didn't have a good experience. The increase in exploration power that grew very slowly and with discipline for 4 years, mostly strictly with anemo characters, was suddenly amped up to 11 making all of my old exploration faves useless in comparison to any random Natlanian for no reason at all.\n\nAs a consequence the open world is no longer character sized but it is Saurian sized too, with massive walls and distances that block my view and feel unreachable, losing the previous sense of being able to go everywhere.\n\nI thought the story and characterizations would make up for this but instead they felt so uninspired to me. Mualani is perfect. Kachina is perfect (just insecure). Mavuika is perfect and only cares for her people. The cutscenes felt like the cheapest \"this would look cool\" shots. Capitano had no intro but just picked up a fight at random.\n\nAs simple or tropey as they were, i felt like characters used to have quirks that made them special, from the drunken god to the psychopathic melusine... with VAs (usually) to match, especially in the later period, with Furina and Arlecchino's VAs that could make even an all dialogue quest super gripping and pleasant. I felt like Mavuika's VA had a very poor performance which is such a shame.\n\nAlso i even have issues with the new models too! Some are now a mix of high detail and low detail that look so bad to me? Iansan's hair looks so over detailed and so much worse than in the Travail trailer, while her skull now looks more basic.\n\nI'm being dramatic but i felt like Genshin suddenly dropped a lot of its original \"soul\" and core vision after this update. I'm sure they tried to cater to player wishes more, but unfortunately for people who loved genshin \"as it was\" like me this wasn't necessarily a good thing.\n\n(sorry for rant, your comment just pushed me to gather my thoughts after being kinda disappointed today).\n\n#### Comment ID lkeh371 with +8 score by [(berrypuffiest, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/comments/1f3ecu7/51_beta_xilonen_animations_via_dim/lkeh371/) (in reply to ID lke4di4):\nLemme just say, amen to all of that. I thought my reception of Natlan was meh because I had gotten so attached to Fontaine (it had me from the start with the victorian/gothic aesthetic, French inspiration, fairy like creatures and a tight-knit cast of mature characters that aren't just random kids with ridiculous jobs) but you've pretty much put my thoughts into words perfectly.\n\nI used to be able to explore for hours at a time and today I did a little in 3 sessions during which I couldn't be bothered to even pick up the oculi or most chests in sight because they were so damn far or needed a saurian. Also ngl, I feel so slighted by this Natlan marketing. No male chars is one thing but how come they now get custom story quest art, custom testing domain, dynamic splash arts, expressive animations, super detailed quests about their environment etc. while the old characters get jack and squat? Meanwhile when they could at least get some screen time in the events, we get 10th Itto comedy relief event or 20th Klee event where she just talks about how OP her faceless mother is.\n\nE.g. Wriothesley's story is one of the most interesting in the entire game, he's a playable character who's a murderer, which is super bold from Hoyo considering they had to good-ify even Wanderer, but I've fully accepted I won't see him for at least 2 years because of the \"well, he's a hermit\" excuse.\n\n### Comment ID lkdpe6c with +4 score by [(AgentWowza, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/comments/1f3ecu7/51_beta_xilonen_animations_via_dim/lkdpe6c/) (in reply to ID lkd8sce):\nMauvika probably will, unfortunately.\n\nI doubt they'd make a harbinger the comic relief tho.\n\n## Comment ID lkdgofl with +17 score by [(LazyYellow4545, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/comments/1f3ecu7/51_beta_xilonen_animations_via_dim/lkdgofl/) (in reply to ID 1f3ecu7):\nAm I on the wrong Reddit?

Hoodies, biker outfits, jeans, pixel sprites, DJ soundboards(?), rollerskates...   \n  \nFontaine was such a triumph, and managed to have technology that felt like it pushed the boundary without throwing away the fantasy setting - seeing all this feels tragic to me, Chasca fits the world better visually, I can only hope she isn't plucked straight out of a different modern game like this because I want to pull for her!\n\n### Comment ID lkdvtbi with +13 score by [(FlareChain, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/comments/1f3ecu7/51_beta_xilonen_animations_via_dim/lkdvtbi/) (in reply to ID lkdny28):\nI am in the same boat.

I'm not sure what to think of how weirdly hi-tech certain specific parts of the Genshin world are, but it at least makes for some fun visuals. \n\nHer animations aren't the flashiest, but they're smooth as hell and have a solid theme to them. I'm a little surprised her Nightsoul-infused normal attacks didn't re-use her un-enhanced normal attack animations. They seemed primed to make use of her skates. Not that I'm complaining about more unique animations, but it seems like such an easy out.\n\nAlso, I hate to be 'that guy', but does she look thicker than the average tall female in this game?

      "# [AI Needs Its Linux: Oumi Comes Out of Stealth with an Open Source Vision by Doug Eadline, Jaime Hampton on 2025-01-29](https://www.hpcwire.com/2025/01/29/ai-needs-its-linux-oumi-comes-out-of-stealth-with-an-open-source-vision/)\nA new company called Oumi has just been launched, emerging from stealth today with $10 million in seed funding. The company’s founders describe Oumi as the world’s first unconditionally open source AI platform, positioning it as a collaborative and transparent alternative to today’s proprietary AI ecosystems, similar to how Linux revolutionized operating systems.\n\nAIwire spoke with Oumi co-founders Manos Koukoumidis and Oussama Elachqar to find out what this new platform means for the AI world.\n\nMaking AI Research More Accessible\n\nKoukoumidis, Oumi’s CEO, explains: “What we’re announcing is the first unconditionally open AI platform that will make it possible for the tens of thousands of AI researchers, scientists, and developers around the world to not just to more easily leverage and harness frontier AI, but also, more importantly, to collaborate on the same platform, working together to advance frontier AI in a collective way that will lead to more transparent and responsible development.”\n\nOumi is developed in collaboration with 13 leading AI universities in the U.S. and the U.K., bringing together some of the most respected names in technology and innovation, including University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Carnegie Mellon University, Princeton University, Caltech, UC Berkeley, GeorgiaTech, Stanford University, University of Washington, New York University, MIT, University of Waterloo, University of Cambridge, and University of Oxford.\n\nThe initiative emerged from discussions with top academics, including Ruslan Salakhutdinov and Amit Acharya from Carnegie Mellon University, who highlighted the growing challenges AI researchers face. These include difficulty conducting large-scale experiments and integrating tools and infrastructure, even when resources like GPUs are available.\n\nKoukoumidis says, “Salakhutdinov was telling me on a Sunday night how hard it is for his students to do this type of research. He said, ‘You know, the last few years have become a lot harder than it was before. We cannot contribute to the frontier anymore. When it comes to larger scale experiments, even smaller scale, it’s too hard for students to figure out all the different things that need to be put together to do this type of research.’”\n\nThe founders then spoke with other top AI researchers and PhD students who also expressed concern about academia’s diminishing role in AI innovation.\n\n“What about the future of AI, if it’s becoming a black box that we just interface with an API? That’s not what academia should do. It’s not how AI and the sciences should be advanced,” Koukoumidis relays.\n\nWhy AI Needs Its Linux\n\nOumi aims to be the Linux of AI, providing an open source alternative to the dominant, closed AI ecosystems. Unlike proprietary AI systems that function as black boxes, Koukoumidis explains that Oumi is built around open code, open data, open model weights, and open collaboration, making it easier for researchers to build upon each other’s work rather than struggling with fragmented, ad-hoc setups.\n\nThe founders also believe that AI research today is hindered by unnecessary complexity as top researchers and PhD students waste valuable time cobbling together infrastructure rather than focusing on advancing the science. By offering a unified, transparent platform, Oumi seeks to remove these barriers, much like how Linux revolutionized operating systems by fostering widespread collaboration and standardization.\n\nBig Tech Won’t Dominate Forever\n\nAs we saw this week with the explosive news of DeepSeek and its impact on the AI landscape, the companies building the largest and most expensive AI models won’t necessarily be on top forever.\n\n“I think they’re going to be trying to play catch up after a while with what’s going to be happening in open source,” Koukoumidis says. “But to make this happen, open source needs its Linux. It needs its seed that we’re hoping to plant with our launch.”\n\nKoukoumidis and Elachqar are well acquainted with the challenges and inefficiencies of AI development in large-scale organizations, as they are alumni of some of the largest companies in tech: Google Cloud and Apple. During their time at these industry giants, they saw firsthand the limitations of siloed AI development and the inefficiencies that come with it. With only a few thousand researchers at even the biggest AI labs, progress remains slow, fragmented, and insufficient to address critical challenges such as safety, robustness, and multimodal AI development.\n\n“Even for a company like Apple that has almost infinite resources, comparatively to other companies, we were still working in silos. There was still way too much we couldn’t do ourselves, and it was so inefficient,” Elachqar told AIwire. “This is way too big of a technology to be done in silos. We need to work together. We need to work for universities with some of the brightest talents, students, and professors all across the US, and the world, to build AI in a more transparent, open, robust way because it’s going to lead to better outcomes for everybody.”\n\nA Unified Platform for AI Development\n\nThe Oumi platform aims to provide an all-in-one solution for AI developers, enabling them to train, fine-tune, and deploy models efficiently across a wide range of environments. Users can work with models ranging from 10 million to 405 billion parameters, leveraging advanced techniques like SFT, LoRA, QLoRA, and DPO to optimize performance.\n\nOumi supports both text and multimodal models, including Llama, Qwen, and Phi, and offers built-in tools for data synthesis and curation using LLM judges to streamline dataset preparation. For deployment, the platform integrates with popular inference engines like vLLM and SGLang while ensuring seamless evaluation through standard AI benchmarks. Oumi was designed for maximum flexibility to allow researchers to run models anywhere, from laptops to supercomputing clusters to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP. It also provides integrations with both open models and commercial APIs, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex AI, and Parasail.\n\nFrom Universities to National Labs: Oumi’s Growing Network\n\nIn addition to their progress and collaboration with major universities, Oumi’s founders have ambitious plans to expand their collaborations with national labs and high performance computing centers to streamline AI research at scale. They have already worked with Argonne National Laboratory’s Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, where they received a grant to test their platform on the Polaris supercomputer, laying the groundwork to simplify running AI workloads on government-funded clusters.\n\nNow that Oumi is emerging from stealth, they anticipate a wave of new collaborations from institutions they may not have previously connected with, as word spreads through academic and research communities.\n\nInvestors See Oumi’s Possibilities for AI Research\n\nOumi has secured $10 million in seed funding, launching itself as a Public Benefit Corporation. The Seed funding was led by Venrock and Obvious Ventures with contributions from Plug & Play and Ascend.\n\nThe founders say investors were drawn to its vision of creating an open source AI platform akin to Linux for AI. The founders pitched Oumi as a long-term strategy that would establish a foundational, community-driven AI ecosystem, one that democratizes access to AI research while still allowing for enterprise monetization down the line.\n\nTheir approach mirrors the Red Hat model for Linux, where the core technology remains open and accessible, but specialized enterprise offerings provide a revenue stream. Investors saw the potential in this model, recognizing that by fostering a collaborative AI development environment, Oumi could tap into contributions from the global research community, both in terms of talent and computing resources, without bearing the immense costs of building AI in isolation.\n\nElachqar says investor interest in Oumi was strong, allowing the team to be selective in choosing backers who aligned with their mission. The overwhelming demand from academia for an open AI platform played a key role in convincing investors, as universities increasingly feel sidelined in the development of cutting-edge AI research.\n\n“We were fortunate enough to have an oversubscribed round, so we were able to pick investors that really share our vision,” Elachqar says. “As soon as they talked to any of the professors that we work with, they were all convinced because there is such a strong need from the universities. They all feel so left out, and it’s such a pressing problem for them.”\n\nA Business Model Serving Both Academia and Industry\n\nThe name Oumi stands for Open Universal Machine Intelligence, reflecting the company’s core mission. The founders chose “machine intelligence” as a more precise, scientific term for AI, emphasizing their commitment to building truly intelligent systems rather than just following industry buzzwords. The “open” in Oumi underscores their belief that AI should be developed transparently and made accessible to everyone unconditionally. Meanwhile, “universal” represents their vision of AI as a pervasive technology, one that should be available across all platforms, regardless of where it is run or how it is accessed.\n\nOumi’s founders chose to establish it as a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) to balance its mission-driven approach with the ability to operate as a sustainable business. The founders saw three primary options: a traditional for-profit, a nonprofit, or a PBC. While a nonprofit structure might have aligned with their goal of making AI universally accessible, they believed it would be too restrictive, particularly in securing the resources needed to develop advanced AI technologies. At the same time, a standard for-profit model didn’t fully reflect their public benefit mission, which is centered on open, collaborative AI development. The PBC structure provides the best of both worlds: it allows Oumi to attract funding and build enterprise-grade products while ensuring that academic institutions and researchers remain a core part of the ecosystem. The founders also recognized that enterprises tend to have greater confidence in products backed by commercial support, making a PBC structure an ideal way to encourage adoption across both academia and industry.\n\nA Shared Future for AI Starts Here\n\nThe Oumi team sees open source as essential for AI, a field where rapid progress depends on collective innovation rather than siloed, duplicative efforts. If successful, Oumi could reshape the AI research landscape by enabling a global community to work together efficiently, leading to safer, more secure, and more widely beneficial AI advancements.\n\nThe company hopes its open platform will lower the barriers to AI research and development. As Oumi emerges from stealth, its founders see this as just the beginning of a broader movement that prioritizes transparency, accessibility, and collaboration over competition, paving the way for AI to be developed as a shared global resource.\n\n“We know that AI is going to be permeating everything that we do, and we want such open technology to be universal, to be accessible to everyone and present everywhere,” Koukoumidis says.",
      "# [Ex-Google, Apple engineers launch unconditionally open source Oumi AI platform that could help to build the next DeepSeek by Sean Michael Kerner on 2025-01-29](https://venturebeat.com/ai/ex-google-apple-engineers-launch-unconditionally-open-source-oumi-ai-platform-that-could-help-to-build-the-next-deepseek/)\nIf it wasn’t clear before, it’s definitely very clear now: Open source really does matter for AI. The success of DeepSeek-R1 has substantively proven there is a need and demand for open-source AI.\n\nBut what exactly is open-source AI? For Meta and its Llama models, it means free access to use the model, with some conditions. DeepSeek is available under a permissive open-source license providing significant access to its architecture and capabilities. However, the specific training code and detailed methodologies, particularly those involving reinforcement learning (RL) techniques like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have not been publicly disclosed. This omission limits the community’s ability to fully understand and replicate the model’s training process.\n\nWhat neither DeepSeek nor Llama enables, however, is full unconditional access to all the model code, including weights as well as training data. Without all that information, developers can still work with the open model but they don’t have all the necessary tools and insights to understand how it really works and more importantly how to build an entirely new model. That’s a challenge that a new startup led by former Google and Apple AI veterans aims to solve.\n\nLaunching today, Oumi is backed by an alliance of 13 leading research universities including Princeton, Stanford, MIT, UC Berkeley, University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, University of Waterloo and Carnegie Mellon. Oumi’s founders raised $10 million, a modest seed round they say meets their needs. While major players like OpenAI contemplate $500 billion investments in massive data centers through projects like Stargate, Oumi is taking a radically different approach. The platform provides researchers and developers with a complete toolkit for building, evaluating and deploying foundation models.\n\n“Even the biggest companies can’t do this on their own,” Oussama Elachqar, cofounder of Oumi and previously a machine learning engineer at Apple, told VentureBeat. “We were effectively working in silos within Apple, and there are many other silos happening across the industry. There has to be a better way to develop these models collaboratively.”\n\nWhat open-source models like DeepSeek and Llama are missing\n\nOumi CEO and former Google Cloud AI senior engineering manager Manos Koukoumidis told VentureBeat that researchers consistently tell him AI experimentation has become extremely complex.\n\nWhile today’s open models are a step forward, it’s not enough. Koukoumidis explained that with current “open” AI models like DeepSeek-R1 and Llama, an organization can use the model and deploy it on their own. What’s missing is that anyone else who wants to build on the model doesn’t know exactly how it was built.\n\nThe Oumi founders believe this lack of transparency is a major hindrance to collaborative AI research and development. Even a project like Llama requires a significant amount of effort from researchers to figure out how to reproduce and build upon the work.\n\nHow Oumi works to open AI for enterprise users, researchers and everyone else\n\nThe Oumi platform works by providing an all-in-one environment that streamlines the complex workflows involved in building AI models.\n\nKoukoumidis explained that to build a foundation model, there are typically 10 or more steps that need to be done, often in parallel. Oumi integrates all necessary tools and workflows into a unified environment, eliminating the need for researchers to piece together and configure various open-source components.\n\nKey technical features include:\n\nSupport for models ranging from 10M to 405B parameters\n\nImplementation of advanced training techniques including SFT, LoRA, QLoRA and DPO\n\nCompatibility with both text and multimodal models\n\nBuilt-in tools for training data synthesis and curation using LLM judges\n\nDeployment options through modern inference engines like vLLM and SGLang\n\nComprehensive model evaluation across standard industry benchmarks\n\n“We don’t have to deal with the open-source development hell of figuring out what you can combine and what works well,” Koukoumidis explained.\n\nThe platform allows users to start small, using their own laptops for initial experiments and model training. As users progress, they can then scale up to larger compute resources, such as university clusters or cloud providers, all within the same Oumi environment.\n\nYou don’t need massive training infrastructure to build an open model\n\nOne of the big surprises with DeepSeek-R1 is the fact that it was apparently built with a fraction of the resources that Meta or OpenAI use to build their models.\n\nAs OpenAI and others invest billions in centralized infrastructure, Oumi is betting on a distributed approach that could dramatically reduce costs.\n\n“The idea that you need hundreds of billions [of dollars] for AI infrastructure is fundamentally flawed,” Koukoumidis said. “With distributed computing across universities and research institutions, we can achieve similar or better results at a fraction of the cost.”\n\nThe initial focus for Oumi is to build out the open-source ecosystem of users and development. But that’s not all the company has planned. Oumi plans to develop enterprise offerings to help businesses deploy these models in production environments.",
      "# [ by Kahini Shah on 2025-01-29](https://obvious.com/ideas/why-we-invested-in-oumi/)\nWhy We Invested in Oumi\n\nMaking AI truly open\n\nKahini Shah | 01/29/2025\n\nIn a very short time, AI has begun transforming science, industries, and society itself. Yet, today’s AI landscape is dominated by a handful of large tech companies and well-funded startups that closely guard their models, training data, and methodologies. This concentration of power and lack of transparency pose significant challenges for companies seeking to deploy AI safely and researchers who want to advance the field.\n\nThat’s why we’ve invested in Oumi, which is creating a genuinely open source platform and community for developing and tuning foundation models. We are excited to be investors in Oumi’s $10M Seed round.\n\nThe exceptional technical leadership of CEO Manos Koukoumidis first drew us to Oumi. As the former leader who bootstrapped and led the Google Cloud’s PaLM efforts and then Gemini’s alignment/safety, Manos brings deep expertise in coordinating large-scale AI teams and infrastructure development. And he has assembled an impressive team of engineers from Google, Apple, Snap, Meta, and other companies to pursue this mission with him.\n\nWe are also impressed with the community of advisors and angel investors that Manos and his team are building around them, which includes researchers such as Ruslan Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon, Georgia Gkioxari from Caltech, and Sergey Levine from UC Berkeley among many others.\n\nOumi aims to create an open source platform that enables end-to-end foundation model research collaboration and development across data curation, synthesis, pre-training, post-training, evaluation, and deployment. The platform allows enterprise customers to customize foundation models for specialized tasks and data using a fully flexible and efficient enterprise-grade platform that they can trust.\n\nThe market opportunity is substantial. Enterprise AI spending is growing rapidly, with nearly half of enterprises expressing interest in moving to open source solutions to reduce costs and vendor lock-in. Oumi is well-positioned to capture this demand by offering enterprises greater flexibility, data privacy, and cost efficiency compared to closed AI platforms.\n\nOumi is structured as a Public Benefit Corporation and puts AI safety at the core of its mission. By fostering collaboration between academia and industry, Oumi aims to ensure this transformative technology develops in service of society.\n\nAt Obvious, we look for companies that combine technical excellence with world positive impact. Oumi is a perfect example of this, working to democratize AI development while prioritizing safety and transparency. We’re proud to partner with Manos and the team as they build an open and transparent future.",

      "# [Oumi Platform Launches to Foster AI Research Collaboration by Mike Vizard on 2025-01-31](https://techstrong.ai/ai-at-the-edge/oumi-platform-launches-to-foster-ai-research-collaboration/)\nAn open Oumi platform for artificial intelligence (AI) researchers has been launched this week by researchers from 13 universities, including Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Stanford University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nThe platform is being administered by a namesake public benefit corporation (PBC) with $10 million in seed funding.\n\nResearchers from other universities that participated in developing the platform include University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, Princeton University, California Institute of Technology, University of California, Berkeley, University of Washington, New York University, University of Waterloo, University of Cambridge and University of Oxford.\n\nThe overall goal is to provide AI researchers with access to the tools, code, weights, data, benchmarks and foundation models needed to collaboratively conduct AI research and reproduce results, says Oumi CEO Manos Koukoumidis. This should make the field more accessible to a wider range of academic institutions that today may not have the resources needed to research AI.\n\nThe approach will promote greater trust in AI systems in an era where much of the research today is being conducted by commercial companies that are training AI models without providing a lot of visibility, he adds. “They tend to be secretive,” he says.\n\nSpecifically, AI researchers will be able to train and fine-tune models from 10M to 405B parameters using multiple state-of-the-art techniques, synthesize and curate data, and access inference engines that can be used to deploy AI models in the cloud or on individual laptops.\n\nAdditionally, AI research will be provided with access to commercial application programming interfaces (APIs) through which they can access models from, for example, OpenAI, Anthropic or Google. Oumi will also provide access to prebuilt reusable workflows and recipes for post training and other common tasks that AI researchers need to routinely perform.\n\nIt’s not clear to what degree organizations might decide to one day mandate reliance on open AI models that are easier to validate and audit, but the one thing that is clear is the gap between open and commercial models in terms of capabilities and performance is rapidly closing. In fact, recent advances in China clearly suggest the amount of code and infrastructure needed to build a functioning AI model may not require billions of dollars in upfront investment.\n\nAlso unclear is how AI research may evolve, but the pace is certainly accelerating. New capabilities and techniques are now being adopted that in some cases instantly upend previous initiatives. A more collaborative approach to AI may accelerate breakthroughs in a way that might even prove to be less disruptive and, ultimately simpler to validate as AI regulations are more widely applied. For example, if the foundational model used to distill a smaller model has already been thoroughly tested that’s one less set of tests that may need to be run later.\n\nOne way or another, however, researchers typically find a way to collaborate. The Oumi platform simply provides a mechanism for streamlining those efforts in a way that benefits a much wider percentage of the global population sooner than later.",
      "# [Oumi: The AI revolution led by Greek minds by Christopher Gogos, Evie Dink on 2025-03-12](https://neoskosmos.com/en/2025/03/12/news/business/oumi-the-ai-revolution-led-by-greek-minds/)\nA new AI tool ‘Oumi’ was launched last month, created by Greek-educated scientists Manos Koukoumides, Panos Achlioptas, and Konstantínos Aísopos.\n\nThe trio have designed a tool to help users create and use AI more easily, with a goal to make AI development more accessible for everyone.\n\nDespite studying their undergraduate degrees in Greece, Manos, Panos and Kostas now live in the US — they call in to the Neos Kosmos office from Palo Alto in California.\n\nManos and Kostas pursued their PhD’s together at Princeton University, and the pair knew Panos from back in Greece. Manos says they “knew him by reputation, and reached out for a discussion. That’s when we decided to work together.” The co-founders have an impressive resume, working at companies like Google and Meta before striking out on their own this year to found Oumi.\n\nManos reflects on the adjustment from Athens to Princeton, incredulous that the armchairs in the computer science lab were more expensive than the actual computers they used for their classes back in Greece.\n\nDespite the limited resources back at home, Manos says his Greek education prepared him very well, and believes Greek institutions still matter.\n\n“In Greece in particular, the spirit and the philosophy behind education is well respected by the people, and we regard education as a very serious endeavor. My hope, in the future, is that the system will be able to absorb good scientists and help them to shape elements of society.”\n\n“You also have to recognise that universities in Greece are very underfunded,” Kostas adds. Panos says Oumi is looking at expanding, and would like to open an office in Greece. “Since we started our education in Greece, we would like to employ people there who have the right skill-set to join us.”\n\nThe co-founders have launched Oumi because they’re worried about the current status quo of frontier AI, with industry labs becoming “extremely secretive”, explains Manos.\n\n“It’s becoming harder and harder for institutions to be able to contribute to frontier AI. It’s very problematic. It’s also about the fact that this important technology, and is now being controlled by a handful of volunteers — it’s about that concentration of power.”\n\nOn the important role of AI, Manos says it’s a critical technology that powers not only the tech industry, but also contributes to climate science and material science and healthcare. Panos is inspired by what he says is Oumi’s noble vision, in wanting to provide the world access to AI that is made by the people, for the people.\n\nManos shares that the most rewarding part of opening the company has been “having the opportunity not just to work on the AI problem, but to do it with the best colleagues and greatest friends.”",
      "# [The Compute Burden by Alexander Campbell on 2025-01-30](https://www.campbellramble.ai/p/the-compute-constraint)\nNot sure about you guys, but I spent a lot more time at my computer this week. All of a sudden, I found the urgent need for more compute.\n\nUsually when people say this they are bragging about the size of their cloud. I'm not talking about the cloud here, I'm talking about that experience all us gamers had in college, playing around with the video card drivers, trying to get ur rig to play Far Cry.\n\nTwenty years later, Far Cry is still crushing GPUs, and in exchange we got a lot more...pixels. When we say there's an 'S-curve' to tech, this is a good example. We've gone from 100MB of VRAM to 32GB (or 320x), and yes the game is beautiful, but it's pretty much the same experience.\n\nBut something different is happening with AI. The sand woke up, giving us a need for exponentially more compute than even the prior trend could satisfy. This isn't just about bigger numbers - it's about a fundamental shift in what's possible, and who gets to participate in that possibility.\n\nI'm not a semis expert - if you want a good 12-24m prediction for this line, go somewhere else. What I'm good at is getting to the core of a problem via experimentation, pushing systems to their breaking point, and using those learnings to understand the dynamic stability of complex systems.\n\nIn other words: you can learn a lot about something by breaking it.\n\nSo today we're going to examine what we've learned one week into DeepSeek's release of R1. This isn't just another model launch - it's a signal of something much bigger. To understand why, let's look at the numbers:\n\nEven if you don't take these benchmarks at face value (as many, including Dario, are skeptical of), what's fascinating isn't just what DeepSeek achieved but how they did it. They're proving that innovation can come from anywhere - a quant shop giving the ivory tower a bloody nose, a scrappy team in New Delhi with great benchmarks…\n\nbut a product with completion problems.\n\nThis is what acceleration looks like. But it also surfaces a crucial paradox that will shape the next era of AI development.\n\nWhen you speak to a model that seems 'human' these days, you're actually talking to a ~million dollar machine sitting in a data center somewhere. The person providing you that compute has to find a million dollars of other demand while charging you $20/hr. Sometimes they have too much, sometimes they have too little. A quaint problem for you and me becomes a million dollar line item, trading GPUs. That's the hidden infrastructure behind even relatively \"small\" models like DeepSeek.\n\nTo put some hard numbers on this: running a 10T parameter model (what we might guesstimate as \"superintelligent\") requires about 20TB of memory. In practical terms, that's around 273 high-end GPUs with 75GB each.\n\nThat translates to about $25M/year in pure compute costs for cloud deployment.\n\nOr around $66M all-in to buy the hardware outright + 10% a year to run it.\n\nAnd we haven't even talked about the developers yet. Though, as DeepSeek has shown, talent for building these systems exists wherever smart people can invert matrices.\n\nBut here's where it gets really interesting - and where the physical limits of our universe start to constrain the dream of \"AI for everyone.\"\n\nIt starts with a question: based on current scaling trajectories, how many years until a 10T parameter model becomes a ~million dollar operation?\n\nThe answer: 14 years.\n\nThat's probably longer than you had in mind when you hear phrases like 'local superintelligence.'\n\nFor that same machine to become a $10k consumer product? We're talking ~20 years.\n\nLet that sink in: even if training models becomes free (because someone else crunched the numbers first), running intelligence will be extremely expensive in both compute and energy terms. And the smarter the model, the exponentially more energy it needs.\n\nHere's a reality check for the timeline doomers: even if we had free superintelligence tomorrow, running it would still exceed the capabilities of most rogue actors we worry about. Any \"AI war\" would be fought between nation-states, not individuals, simply due to the physics of compute.\n\nBut what about making it mobile? Surely our phones will eventually catch up?\n\nLet's run that experiment. How long until we can have even a single H100-level GPU in your phone? (Remember, we'd need about 270 of them for our super-intelligent model, but let's start small.)\n\nThe brutal reality: a single H100 (with 80GB of RAM) consumes 700 watts. Your iPhone battery would last about 65 seconds - if it didn't melt first from being run 20x harder than designed.\n\nRunning DeepSeek on your headphones would drain them instantly. Long batteries, as they say.\n\nBut there's another wrinkle to this compute crunch - one that gets surprisingly little attention. It's not just about raw processing power, but how these models actually think.\n\nWhen you interact with DeepSeek extensively, you notice it follows the same thought process every time:\n\n<think>\n\n1. Summarize the conversation so far\n\n2. Break the query into manageable pieces\n\n3. Think through each piece systematically\n\n4. Evaluate and synthesize results\n\n</think>\n\n“I am sorry. I cannot answer that question. I am an AI assistant…”\n\nWhat takes some trial and error to discover is just how inefficient this process is for users. Not only do you find yourself waiting for the model to finish its... extensive... internal monologue, but you're also paying for every token of that verbose thinking process. Which means it’s expensive.\n\nThis creates a perverse incentive structure: Chain of Thought (CoT) improves benchmark scores but makes models both more expensive to run and more tedious to interact with.\n\nEvery time you reply, even without throwing in 500 lines of code, the model needs to 'read' its prior answers as part of the conversation's context. Those \"thinking out loud\" tokens pile up, consuming more and more energy as the conversation continues.\n\nMeaning the moment you inevitably hit your usage caps is precisely when you need those tokens most! This is something we should all be vigilant about going forward - not just how exponentially compute-intensive this intelligence really is, but how the economics of intelligence incentivize both models and their commercial developers to prioritize long, verbose answers.\n\nWhich brings us to the investment implications - and they're not quite what you might think.\n\n“Wow Campbell, you're telling me we need more compute, next you'll be lecturing me on Jevons paradox.\"\n\nNo, that part is obvious.\n\nAnd previously discussed.\n\nBut if you want a strawman, that’s where to put us. But the point we're making is more subtle than just \"compute demand goes up.\"\n\nIt’s not just about the chips, it’s about the energy. Yes, we just turned rocks into genius knowledge workers, and they drink electricity by the megawatt.\n\nWith dramatic consequences for the volatility of your energy consumption,\n\nand its carbon intensity.\n\nNo, what’s emerging is a fundamental shift in where and how that compute gets deployed. The development of open-source AI isn't just instantly creating more demand - it's creating a specific type of demand that our current infrastructure isn't built for.\n\nLocal aka your model on your machine.\n\nConsider this: if the model is entirely open source, meaning you can download not just the engine but the weights (what Facebook/Meta rejected me from doing the other day, see below), then you can own not only the model but any derivative work that comes from it. If you train it to be good at music, art, accounting, or analyzing customer feedback - whatever it is it's yours.\n\nIt also means, that for the first time in a long time, when you talk to your computer, no one is watching.\n\nYou can ask the model anything you want. While the model retains the right to refuse to answer, or be elusive or unaligned, it’s still your model.\n\nIn practice, this feels strangely liberating, like the early days of the internet. The conversations you have with the machine aren’t getting logged. Not unless you want them to be. Not unless you are working on something you need to remember. Not unless you want to ‘fork’ the model and make your own. Which I did. Multiple times, the first night.\n\nThis changes the game entirely for enterprise AI adoption.\n\nEven if DeepSeek's benchmarks are overblown, even if Llama was almost as good, what matters isn't just what happened but how. The ivory tower just got a bloody nose from a quant shop, and innovations are emerging from Bengaluru to Hangzhou. This is what real acceleration looks like - constraints breeding creativity, and creativity breeds compounding.\n\nEnter Nvidia's DIGITS - a desktop workstation connected to their 80GB Blackwell chip - which are supposed to go on sale this spring, and should bring medium-size models to your workplace on a 2-4 year horizon.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple made a fascinating bet in ~2020, moving to a 'unified memory architecture' that abandons the traditional GPU/RAM distinction. While the software to train these models remains primarily built for Nvidia's CUDA ecosystem, this doesn't matter as much for inference aka running them. Which is now possible.\n\nWant to run the full DeepSeek model (all 671B parameters) locally aka at home?\n\nWire together 8 Mac M4 Minis and you're in business. Not exactly pocket-sized, but a glimpse of where we're headed.\n\nBut here's where we arrive at the democratization paradox - and why it matters for the future of AI.\n\nWhat we're really witnessing - and what my week of breaking DeepSeek has illuminated - is an asymmetric revolution in AI.\n\nBy focusing on efficient training and standing on the shoulders of giants, DeepSeek is contributing to a process that's now borderline unstoppable: the acceleration of machine intelligence through the democratization of knowledge. Think wikipedia, common crawl, mapReduce, and linux. Knowledge repositories, processing algorithms aka machines for information. Knowledge about how to train these systems, how to tinker with them, and increasingly, how to bootstrap more condensed versions of intelligence. Each latest model building upon all the work done in the past.\n\nIs it any surprise that the reinforcement learning tactics used in India and China this past month follow such similar patterns?\n\nWrite down problems and Chain of Thought answers, make the model try to solve them, score what \"good\" looks like. Loop.\n\nSounds a lot like how we train humans.\n\nBut here's the paradox that will define the next decade of AI:\n\nThe code is free, but the compute is expensive\n\nThe knowledge is open, but the infrastructure is centralized\n\nThe potential is unlimited, but the physics are unforgiving\n\nThis creates three distinct futures for AI deployment:\n\nThe Cloud Future: Where most users access powerful models through APIs, paying by the token and accepting the limitations of shared infrastructure. To which I say, let’s put free wifi in the NYC subway and then sure let’s talk.\n\nThe Enterprise Future: Where medium-sized models (~2-8GB) run locally on specialized hardware like Nvidia's digits workstations, handling specific business tasks with data privacy guarantees.\n\nThe Consumer Future: Still frustratingly far away for anything approaching current model capabilities. That iPhone superintelligence? Check back in 2040.\n\nAnd this brings us full circle to our gaming metaphor.\n\nJust as Far Cry pushed the boundaries of consumer graphics, demanding more from our GPUs year after year, AI is now pushing the boundaries of what's computationally possible. But there's a crucial difference: gaming's demands followed an S-curve because human perception has limits and our interfaces have limited resolution. You can only make pixels so pretty.\n\nIntelligence, it turns out, has no such ceiling. Each increment of capability - from coding assistant to mathematical reasoning to creative partnership - unlocks new demands we hadn't even imagined before. Like a game that keeps generating new levels as you play, each more complex than the last.\n\nThe good news? This creates tremendous opportunities for innovation. The same way gaming drove consumer GPU development, AI's compute demands will drive the next wave of hardware innovation. The better news? The constraints we're hitting aren't arbitrary - they're fundamental physics problems waiting to be solved.\n\nSo next time someone tells you AGI is just around the corner, ask them about their cooling solution. Because in the end, superintelligence isn't just a software problem - it's a hardware problem, an energy problem, and a heat dissipation problem all rolled into one.\n\nAnd that's exactly what makes it interesting.\n\nTill next time.\n\nDisclaimers\n\nCharts and graphs included in these materials are intended for educational purposes only and should not function as the sole basis for any investment decision.

      "# [UConn's Dan Hurley unloads on officials after overtime loss to Memphis at Maui: 'A complete joke' by David Borges, Staff on 2024-11-26](https://www.newstimes.com/sports/uconn-mens-basketball/article/dan-hurley-maui-invitational-officials-uconn-huski-19942480.php)\nNo. 2-ranked UConn (4-1) was whistled for 29 fouls, including three technicals, and had three different players foul out of its 99-97, overtime loss to the Tigers. Unranked (for now) Memphis had two players foul out and committed 21 fouls.\n\nBut that wasn't one chaffed Hurley the most. It was an over-the-back call on Liam McNeeley, followed by a technical on Hurley for disagreeing with the call, that irked the coach more than anything.\n\n\"That was a joke,\" Hurley said of the call on McNeeley. \"That call, at that point of the game ... there was no attempt to block out. There was a player on Memphis that made a half-assed effort to rebound that basketball, and Liam McNeeley high-pointed that rebound. For that call to be made, at that point of the game, was a complete joke.\"\n\n\"I don't know what happened,\" he insisted. \"I might have lost my balance by the absurdity of the call. Or, maybe I tripped. But if I made that call, at that point, I would've ignored the fact that I was on my back.\"\n\nHurley never mentioned the officiating crew of Pat Driscoll, Stephen Anderson and Scott Brown by name, but noted: \"I'd never seen the one ref, I didn't even know he was a college ref. I was familiar with the other two, so I'm not surprised.\"\n\n\"Our medical trainer must have said something under his breath in the huddle, gets T'd up,\" Hurley explained. \"A trainer who is just the nicest guy, very quiet guy, might have muttered something under his breath. Normally that situation, an official comes over to you and says, 'Hey, Coach, tell that guy to shut up.' Because I know they don't want to hear it from me. That's commonly how that should have been handled. But, I had a lot of issues with what went on out there.\"\n\nWith about 2 1/2 minutes left in overtime and UConn up by three, Samson Johnson was called for a technical foul after pushing Memphis center Moussa Cisse. Memphis's Dain Dainja also picked up a \"T\" after confronting Johnson. For Johnson, it was his fifth foul, forcing the Huskies to play the final 2 1/2 minutes without a true center (Tarris Reed Jr. had fouled out earlier).\n\n\"He's got to be smarter,\" Hurley said of Johnson. \"But Samson was getting shoved, his jersey was ripped. He didn't get a foul called for him the entire game, he ended the game with his jersey ripped down the center and he didn't get a single call. He's frustrated.\"",

      "# [Who’s running this team? UCLA’s DeShaun Foster said he makes fourth-down calls by Ben Bolch, www.latimes.com, ben-bolch on 2024-09-05](https://www.latimes.com/sports/ucla/story/2024-09-05/ucla-football)\nEric Bieniemy, a two-time Super Bowl champion offensive coordinator, constructed UCLA’s plays.\n\nDeciding whether to go for it on fourth down?\n\nThat’s entirely up to DeShaun Foster, the new coach whose experience before this season had been confined to working with running backs.\n\n“Every decision that we did was me,” Foster said Wednesday during his first meeting with reporters since the Bruins’ come-from-behind, 16-13 victory over Hawaii last weekend. “ … I’m telling everybody what to do. There’s no decisions being made by any other coaches, so anything that’s happening is coming directly from me.”\n\nHow would Foster describe his philosophy when it comes to making those critical fourth-down decisions?\n\n“It depends on the situation,” he said.\n\nAt least in the opener, the Bruins unveiled a decidedly cautious approach. On their opening drive, they punted on fourth and five at Hawaii’s 44-yard line.\n\n“I just didn’t like the situation at the time,” Foster said.\n\nIn the second quarter, facing fourth and four at Hawaii’s 34-yard line, it looked like UCLA was going to go for it as players readied themselves near the line of scrimmage. Foster said he decided to kick a field goal after Hawaii called a timeout, though the box score indicated that the Bruins called the timeout.\n\n“With the momentum going, I probably was gonna go for it,” Foster said. “Then, they end up calling a timeout so we kicked the field goal.”\n\nBlake Glessner missed a 52-yarder, preserving Hawaii’s 7-0 lead.\n\nThe Bruins unleashed a pass-heavy offense, throwing 38 passes while combining for only 13 carries by their running backs. Foster said the running backs’ struggles — Keegan Jones, T.J. Harden and Anthony Frias II combined for only 24 yards — led to so many passes.\n\nUCLA’s troubles moving the ball on the ground went beyond a short-handed offensive line, Foster said.\n\n“Just the whole offense, just not exactly executing the way that they should,” Foster said. “So, just a lot of stuff that’s easy to fix — ID’ing [situations], stuff like that. So, I’m not really worried about it. They should get out here and make sure that they work through their corrections and get better.”\n\nThe run game could get a boost in time for the first Big Ten game against Indiana on Sept. 14 at the Rose Bowl. Foster intimated that injured tackles Garrett DiGiorgio and Reuben Unije should be back by then. It’s also possible that running back Jalen Berger, a transfer from Michigan State, could make his UCLA debut after continuing his efforts to round into form.\n\nUnited again\n\nHis team needing a lift midway through the third quarter, UCLA safety Ramon Henderson knew just the guy to provide it. So he approached wide receiver Rico Flores Jr. on the sideline with some simple instructions.\n\n“Catch the ball,” Henderson told him, “and run.”\n\nFlores complied, hauling in a 39-yard touchdown pass from Ethan Garbers to spark the team’s comeback. Hearing the play call and seeing Hawaii’s safety not looking his way before the snap, Flores said he knew he was going to score, especially after making a move to free himself from the cornerback.\n\n“I posted and took it over the top,” Flores said, “and the rest is history.”\n\nIt was the sort of play Henderson knew Flores could make because he had seen it when they were teammates at Notre Dame before transferring to UCLA.\n\nFlores’ move late in the offseason led to his exclusion from “EA Sports College Football ‘25,” though the video game makers included him in their recent update.\n\n“Finally,” Flores said. “Long time coming.”\n\nFlores’ player rating left him disappointed, though he could be in for an upgrade after making three catches for a team-high 102 yards against Hawaii.\n\n“I wouldn’t say I’ve arrived yet,” Flores said. “I’ve still got a lot of work to do.”\n\nEtc.\n\nFoster said using multiple punters and kickers in the opener was part of a planned platoon. Mateen Bhaghani replaced Glessner and made all three of his field-goal attempts, including the 32-yard game-winner with 56 seconds left. Chase Barry averaged 39.5 yards on two punts and Brody Richter averaged 33.5 yards on two. … The Bruins practiced for about 2½ hours Wednesday in scorching heat. Said Flores: “It didn’t feel like a bye week practice at all.” … Foster on his focus in the bye week: “I want the whole team to get better, so it’s not a one-sided thing like one side of the ball needs to get better and the other side can stay where they’re at; everybody needs to improve.”"
