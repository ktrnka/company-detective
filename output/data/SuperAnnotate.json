The only thing you need to spend a little time on is to understand how to write the ML Backend for auto-labelling and ML assisted labelling - and they have very nice examples for all usual vision tasks which you can just copy paste.

I never heard back from Outlier for some reason. I failed the writing portions of Invisible AI and Mindrift somehow (I have an English degree).

LSS, I believe Outlier.ai is researching the evolution of the labor market behavior in the Gig economy to determine the % change in  price for time that dictates behavior change in workers.\n \nNotes on the experience:\n\n\nPROS:\n easy sign up, live on-boarding session,  Slack channels initially helpful, Pay $40/hr(Non-Coding), feedback was helpful, weekly pay via PayPal, Bonus Pay, Paid Training,  Enablement or Assessment Pay, help ticket system, project and skill based pay\nCONS:\nInconsistent Volume-$500 one day to 2 weeks of no work *unreliable source of income,  final payment never received,  possible identify theft after sign up, dropped from platform with no explanation, my tax form verification was flagged after they had been paying me for 2 months, Slack and Outlier.ai will randomly disappear and come back during the day, feedback contains spelling and grammar errors, I opened about 11 help tickets for issues related to administration- i.e late payment,  task not recognized,  task errors,  projects being suspended,  EQ often, 3 months w/ no team lead assigned,  no human support. \n\n\nHere's my TED Talk on pay and why I think this is research and not real. \nIn May, they changed their pay structure and dropped Training Pay Rates across the platform, up to 75% an hour for some people. Outlier.ai was allegedly revisiting that policy because some people were claiming their training pay was dropped as low as $6.84/hour. I think mine was supposed to go down to $25 for training only,  but I was dropped from the platform before it went into effect. This disproportionately impacts subjugation populations and exploits low wage workers willing to take less than minimum wage because it is more than $0. \n\n\nThe pay drop for thousands of users was a red flag for me. I do not do business that way. As a policy, It seemed to coincide with labor market changes. Pay rate decreases exploit taskers who left their full-time job for this income,  then it decreased by over 50% for thousands of people. That is so awful it is laughable.  It would be like leaving a job making $30/hrs for a new job @ $40/hrs in a written offer, Then have your new job say \"actually we're going to pay you $20/hr sometimes,  no guarantee of any work either and we're closing for 2 weeks, all projects on hold indefinitely, go talk to each other in Slack.\" At which point every hour you work at $20/hr also cost you -$10/hr in pay difference/opportunity cost. \nTechnically your net is $10/hr, no benefits, supplemental income at best. Now you have to re-enter the labor market,  but stagflation says you're now competing with 200 people for your old job title at $25/hour. Best case scenario you take a pay cut to get your old job back. \nI think Outlier.ai behaves a lot more like a post pandemic wage elasticity experiment that's examining the evolution of the Gig economy while shilling Grammarly and Slack under the guise of training LLMs. They don't care if you can beat the AI model to \"delight the user\" as the platform claims,  they are trying to determine at what price people will work to beat the AI models.  In other words, what is the least amount of money they have to pay a person to beat a computer? At what price does AI win?\n\n\nDNR\n\n### Comment ID l766d4u with +1 score by [(NorthAge2517, Reddit, 2024-06-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/1cyb9dv/dropped_from_dataannotation_what_are_some_other/l766d4u/) (in reply to ID l5yno09):\nDang this is brilliant… I guess lucky us for being among the first few to get caught up in this where they are paying higher than later down the road when it’s like $2 per hour…\n\n## Comment ID l6vf0b1 with +1 score by [(RedheadRJ, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/1cyb9dv/dropped_from_dataannotation_what_are_some_other/l6vf0b1/) (in reply to ID 1cyb9dv):\nI’ve been trying to find a work from home job for months now.

The company offers a platform that allows customers to build, fine-tune, and iterate dataset creation to accelerate the development lifecycle for modern LLM and Gen AI applications.\n\nSuperAnnotate operates globally, with offices and customers worldwide including Databricks, Canva, and Motorola Solutions.\n\nFinSMEs\n\n18/11/2024",
      "# [SuperAnnotate helps companies manage their AI datasets by Kyle Wiggers on 2024-11-18](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/superannotate-helps-companies-manage-their-ai-data-sets/)\nHigh-quality data may be the key to high-quality AI. With studies finding that dataset curation, rather than size, is what really affects an AI model’s performance, it’s unsurprising that there’s a growing emphasis on dataset management practices. According to some surveys, AI researchers today spend much of their time on data prep and organization tasks.\n\nBrothers Vahan Petrosyan and Tigran Petrosyan felt the pain of having to manage lots of data while training algorithms in college. Vahan went so far as to create a data management tool during his PhD research on image segmentation.\n\nA few years later, Vahan realized that developers — and even corporations — would happily pay for similar tooling. So the brothers founded a company, SuperAnnotate, to build it.\n\n“During the explosion of innovation in 2023 surrounding models and multimodal AI, the need for high-quality datasets became more stringent, with each organization having multiple use cases requiring specialized data,” Vahan said in a statement. “We saw an opportunity to build an easy-to-use, low-code platform, like a Swiss Army Knife for modern AI training data.”\n\nSuperAnnotate, whose clients include Databricks and Canva, helps users create and keep track of large AI training datasets. The startup initially focused on labeling software, but now provides tools for fine-tuning, iterating, and evaluating datasets.\n\nWith SuperAnnotate’s platform, users can connect data from local sources and the cloud to create data projects on which they can collaborate with teammates. From a dashboard, users can compare the performance of models by the data that was used to train them, and then deploy those models to various environments once they’re ready.\n\nSuperAnnotate also provides companies access to a marketplace of crowd-sourced workers for data annotation tasks. Annotations are usually pieces of text labeling the meaning or parts of data that models train on, and serve as guideposts for models, “teaching” them to distinguish things, places and ideas.\n\nTo be frank, there are several Reddit threads about SuperAnnotate’s treatment of the data annotators it uses, and they aren’t flattering. Annotators complain about communication issues, unclear expectations, and low pay.\n\nFor its part, SuperAnnotate claims it pays fair market rates and that its demands on annotators aren’t outside the norm for the industry. We’ve asked the company to provide more detailed information about its practices and will update this piece if we hear back.\n\nEdit: A few hours after this story was published, SuperAnnotate sent this statement via email: “About eight months ago, during a period of rapid scaling, we encountered challenges in maintaining clear communication with some annotators working on our projects. As is sometimes the case during rapid growth, a few process gaps emerged. We took this feedback seriously and have since made improvements to both how annotators interact with the platform and communication processes.”\n\nThere are several competitors in the AI data management space, including startups like Scale AI, Weka, and Dataloop. San Francisco-based SuperAnnotate has managed to hold its own, however, recently raising $36 million in a Series B round led by Socium Ventures, with participation from Nvidia, Databricks Ventures, and Play Time Ventures.\n\nThe fresh capital, which brings SuperAnnotate’s total raised to just over $53 million, will be used for augmenting its current team of around 100, for product R&D, and for growing SuperAnnotate’s customer base of roughly 100 companies.\n\n“We aim to build a platform capable of fully adapting to enterprises’ evolving needs and offering extensive customization in data fine-tuning,” Vahan said.",

      "# [Data Labeling in the Era of AI by Sabrina Wu, Vivek Ramaswami on 2024-05-03](https://aspiringforintelligence.substack.com/p/data-labeling-in-the-era-of-ai)\nThe big news in AI recently was undoubtedly Meta releasing Llama 3 on April 18th. Quickly dubbed as the “most capable open source model” to date, Llama3 featured two model weights, with 8B and 70B parameters, and claims to measure more favorably on several benchmarks relative to Gemma 7B, Mistral 7B, and Claude 3.\n\nWhile the initial euphoria was (understandably) around the massive context windows and top marks in public benchmarks, it was one of the less hyped aspects that we thought was the most interesting:\n\nIn an interview on the Dwarkesh Podcast, Mark Zuckerberg commented:\n\n“The 8 billion is nearly as powerful as the biggest version of Llama-2 that we released. So the smallest Llama-3 is basically as powerful as the biggest Llama-2.”\n\nSo what was instrumental in driving Llama3’s performance relative to Llama2, if not size? The answer is in the data. Meta was able to train Llama3 with high-quality annotated data, revealing that data quality may matter more than the volume of data in training a model.\n\nMartin Casado, GP at Andreessen Horowitz, echoed a similar point, tweeting that LLMs are not as restricted on CPU or size of data, but that the main bottleneck is access to “high quality annotated data.”\n\nSo what is data annotation anyway, and why is it important?\n\nLet’s dive in\n\nWhat is Data Annotation And Why Is It Important?\n\nData annotation is the process of labeling, identifying, and classifying specific elements in data to train ML models. This annotated data should serve as a ground truth for the model to predict and respond to real-world data and information.\n\nIn a pre-LLM world, drawing bound boxes around objects (as depicted below) was a common task in computer vision, especially in object detection and image segmentation applications. Today, in a post-LLM world, data annotation has evolved into a broader array of tasks including cleaning, sorting, and filtering data. Many of these LLMs are often pre-trained on vast datasets and then fine-tuned for specific tasks.\n\nAt the core, the success of a model relies on accurately trained data. These models are trained on billions of diverse datasets including text, internet articles, videos, images, and more. Poorly labeled data and inaccurate annotation can lead to incorrect conclusions, biased models, and unreliable AI systems. Many of us have heard of the '“garbage in, garbage out” saying. If you start with poorly trained data (e.g., the model thinks that a “stop” sign is a “go” sign), then the model will draw wrong conclusions about when a car should go vs. stop.\n\nIn an article questioning whether or not we are “running out of training data”, The Information describes how “developers could experiment with retraining models on a smaller, high-quality subset of their original training data to improve their performance”, demonstrating the critical importance of why having high-quality training data is valued among developers building in ML.\n\nWhere Are We In The Evolution of Data Annotation?\n\nInba Thiru wrote an excellent blog post last month detailing the evolution of data labeling techniques, arguing that there were three main phases of data labeling and annotation:\n\nFully Manual → The traditional method employed by most organizations, where all data labeling and annotation is outsourced to typically low or mid-cost human annotators, often offshore.\n\nSemi-Supervised → A middle ground between manual and fully automated approaches, where software is used to help augment and streamline the annotation process but human oversight is still required.\n\nFully Automated → The “holy grail”, where advanced techniques such as AI and machine learning algorithms are employed to fully automate data labeling with software, and human / manual intervention is no longer required.\n\nWhile in the “Pre-LLM” world, data annotation and labeling was still a very manual process (Amazon launched Mechanical Turk way back in 2005), we are seeing more and more “Semi-Automated” and “Automated” vendors pop up in recent years. Startups like Scale, SuperAnnotate, Snorkel, and others have gathered traction and landed major logos by offering a spectrum of software + services enabling enterprises to complete their data labeling and annotation at scale.\n\nFrom the market checks we’ve done, many large customers prefer the “Semi-Automated” approach, where a thin layer of human services enhances the underlying software. Why have humans “in the loop” at all? Though we are moving past the traditional use cases of “draw a bounding box around a stop sign”, there are still plenty of edge cases and domain-specific data sets where manual intervention is helpful. Many of the data analysts and engineers working with annotators emphasize the need for accessing and running quality checks with the humans in the loop.\n\nWhile humans may not be made redundant in the near-term, we are certainly marching towards being “fully automated” in the long term.\n\nWho is competing in this space?\n\nThe “Data Collection and Labelling” market is large, with some estimates pegging the TAM at ~$12B today growing to ~$30B by 2030. This massive global spend has attracted a wide range of competitors, ranging from mature BPOs to scaled startups and emerging entrants.\n\nScale AI\n\nPerhaps the largest and most well-known startup in the category is Scale AI, founded in 2016 and originally focused on providing data labeling and annotation for machine learning models. Early traction came from use cases centered around autonomous vehicles, but the company has since developed a platform with a suite of products for Generative AI & RLHF, testing and evaluation, LLM optimization and more. The expansion has not gone unnoticed by the market; annual revenue is estimated at ~$700M+ and Accel is said to be leading a new investment into Scale at a whopping $13B.\n\nSuperAnnotate\n\nSuperAnnotate was founded in 2018 by two brothers who dropped out of their PhD programs when they realized they could apply their research accelerating pixel-accurate annotations into the real world. Originally focused on image annotation for mostly computer-vision use cases, SuperAnnotate has expanded to supporting multi-modality and enabling enterprises to fine-tune, explore, and orchestrate their data more efficiently. Their product suite aligns with a thesis behind a “thin layer” of services augmented with software tools. Current customers include AI-centric companies like Databricks and Adept, as well as more “traditional” companies like Qualcomm and Motorola.\n\nSnorkel\n\nSnorkel began life in 2015 as a research project in the Stanford AI Lab where five researchers “set out to explore training data programming, a new interface layer for machine learning”. The team then spun out in 2019 to build a commercial company, quickly receiving funding from Lightspeed, Greylock, and others. Today, Snorkel offers two main products: Snorkel Flow to programmatically label and curate data for AI models; and Snorkel Custom, a more white-glove approach applying Snorkel AI experts to accelerate enterprise adoption of AI.\n\nOthers\n\nThere are plenty of other companies in the space, ranging from:\n\nTraditional manual vendors (e.g. Appen, Mechanical Turk, Wipro)\n\nSoftware-enabled vendors (e.g. Labelbox, HumanSignal, Hive, Surge, Invisible)\n\nAnd many additional emerging startups (e.g. Data Curation companies like Cleanlab, Datology, and Visual Layer that aim to improve data quality and accuracy for LLMs), and other newer entrants like Refuel.ai\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is no doubt that the resurgence of interest in AI & ML and the evolution of advanced models like Llama 3 has accelerated the need for high-quality annotated and labeled data. Semi-supervised vendors like Scale, SuperAnnotate, and others are likely benefiting from these trends, and we don’t expect the appetite for high-quality data to recede anytime soon.\n\nWhile the market for data annotation is certainly large, there are a few questions we believe should be top of mind:\n\nCustomer concentration → Will just a handful of large model providers (e.g. Meta, Google, OpenAI) dominate the need for data labeling, or will all enterprises require this in some form or fashion?\n\nMargins → Traditionally manual data labeling operates at low margins given the commoditization of human labor. For example Appen, an Australian data labeling company using mostly manual services, operates at 36% gross margins and carries a market cap of ~$150M despite nearly $300M in revenue. How do the new vendors avoid this fate and trade more like pure software companies?\n\nEvolving techniques → There is a school of thought that we are in an interesting “middle ground” era of AI where the need for high-quality data is actually peaking and that there will be other techniques to fulfill model requirements (like synthetic data or reusable data). How can vendors in this space build and maintain moats in an evolving ecosystem?\n\nWe are tracking this space closely and are excited to see how things play out!\n\nPlease subscribe, and share the love with your friends and colleagues who want to stay up to date on the latest in artificial intelligence and generative apps!🙏🤖",
