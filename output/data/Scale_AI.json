However, I had an issue verifying my government ID with a 3rd-party service and then it just deleted all my tasks and I can't get them back. If I didn't have this issue, I would have been continuing to work well for Scale AI.

They are great about paying weekly for standard tasks completed. However, they are totally unreliable when it comes to timely payment for compensated trainings and special missions (e.g., complete 20 tasks in \\[XX\\] days and get bonus pay of \\[XX\\] amount). You need to make sure take screenshots and log the task ID, start time, completion time and date to ensure you have proof that you completed missions. For the paid trainings, you need to carefully log date/time of training/subject/project and who is giving the training because, despite they have attendance forms, they are very bad about paying you for these. They have great project leads who are generally helpful and will work with you to resolve issues but it is a hassle and there are frequent complaints about these things on the Slack channel.\n\nAnother issue is that they only give you a certain amount of time to complete tasks and sometimes, due to the complexity of the task, it's not enough time. If the task expires before you complete it, you don get paid. Sometimes the task will come up in your queue again and you'll get paid for the time spent on the previous attempt as well as the second attempt, but there's no guarantee. So, time management is crucial. The problem is that the expectations for precision and work quality are high, so you don't want to submit a task with an incomplete answer (which is possible to do but then then you may get feedback that could result in lower pay or removal from a certain project). \n\nThe minimum time requirement, for now, is 15 hours for every 3 out 5 weeks you work. \n\nFor now, I'm sticking with this because it's decent side hustle pay, flexible, and the tasks challenge me to think in different ways. Not sure if I can keep it up for more than 2 or 3 months because my day job is challenging and working 70 hours a week is not healthy or sustainable. However, I'm motivated to pay for a couple of house projects, so that carrot is dangling in front of me.\n\n\\-----\n\nI deleted my original post by mistake, but I wanted to provide an Update on my Outlier AI experience.\n\nUPDATED 1/30/24\n\nAfter going through Onboarding with several other contractors and a project manager yesterday (all real humans), I got paid today for the $350 assessment and training and another $210 I earned over the weekend. I have to say that Outlier seems completely legit. It's not easy work, and you have to make sure that your task screen is always open so you get paid for time while researching. I will continue to update on my experience but less than two weeks in, I'm convinced it's legit.\n\nORIGINAL POST from last week\n\nI got a LinkedIn from Outlier about this a week ago. They offered me $45/hr to consult on AI LLM as someone with expertise in advanced writing. I skimmed through their alleged 2-3 hour training video (took me about an hour). I successfully completed the assessment (10 questions) last Sunday. They said it would take about 2-3 days (business days I assume) for my assessment responses to be reviewed.\n\nVery early on Thursday morning (just a little longer than 3 bus. days), I received an email saying I passed the assessment and inviting me to do an onboarding or just get started with tasks. Yesterday did a task that took about 20 minutes and today I think I have $17 in earnings showing up in my earnings portal (about right).  Incidentally, they also sent me a Google doc that provided me \"feedback\" on my assessment. I reviewed the feedback and generally felt it was reasonable.\n\nOutlier also said they'd pay me $250 to watch the training video and $100 if I passed the assessment ($350 total). I got a separate email today indicating that the training / assessment payment would show up in my earnings portal within 24 hours.\n\nI can keep everyone posted to see if they pay me in a timely fashion. They pay on Tuesdays, so I'm not sure if I'm supposed to get paid this coming Tuesday or the following.\n\nThe Slack channel looks like no one uses it and doesn't seem well thought out.\n\nSo far, while I'm not highly impressed, it doesn't NOT seem legit. I won't do a lot more work until I get paid for the assessment and the task I performed as a trial.\n\nEdit: Wanted to add that the system is a bit glitchy. When taking the assessment, I had to redo one of the 10 questions because there seemed to be a bug. The assessment wasn't that hard, but took about 1.5 hours for me to complete because of the glitch factor. Once I got in a groove, it was easier to breeze through the questions.\n\nI signed up to get paid via PayPal. It didn't require me to provide my PayPal password as someone on this thread had to do. Make sure you have 2FA set up on your PayPal account just in case.\n\n### Comment ID kob1wq3 with +2 score by [(Monty-675, Reddit, 2024-01-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1989kbz/scale_ai_post_legit/kob1wq3/) (in reply to ID ko8y94o):\nThanks for the update!\n\n#### Comment ID koe7h1n with +1 score by [(Jaded-Ad-1366, Reddit, 2024-02-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1989kbz/scale_ai_post_legit/koe7h1n/) (in reply to ID kob1wq3):\nu/Monty-675 sure. The biggest issue I have with the work so far is that it is actually really hard - a lot of complex instructions. The Slack channel promotes opportunities to reach out with a PM to discuss issues, but I'm not so invested. You get 60 minutes to work on a task or it expires and I don't think you get paid if you don't complete it and so I end up feeling rushed. I wouldn't mind getting paid for 60 minutes while learning, and taking an extra 5 or 10 minutes to not feel rushed. I am not sure how long I will last or if my work quality won't be good enough because I'm not able to devote tons of time to mastering it. I'm really getting insight into the role of AI and how companies are trying to use it. The tasks we are working on are for Outlier's paying clients. Since I work at a challenging full time job, it might not be worth the mental effort for me, though the pay is not bad. I've earned $700 in the past five days.\n\n### Comment ID ktpsqfp with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-03-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1989kbz/scale_ai_post_legit/ktpsqfp/) (in reply to ID ko8y94o):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID ktpwv3o with +1 score by [(Jaded-Ad-1366, Reddit, 2024-03-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1989kbz/scale_ai_post_legit/ktpwv3o/) (in reply to ID ktpsqfp):\nHey!

There is no way to get assistance, because Remotasks tickets are closed, they tell you to ask a team leader, team leaders tell you to open a ticket. The amount of time needed for live sessions and to follow the ever changing instructions and specifications on the 3 different Slack channels is A LOT and it is all unpaid.\n\nThe tracked time is correct only after 5-6 days, you need to trust it will be like this, and if not, you have to pray all the Gods that someone will assist you without you losing again extra time.\n\nColleagues are reporting buggy feedbacks and are not being paid for tasks, again team leaders are not assisting. I'm glad some people have survived the onboarding chaos and have been paid for their work, but many people are reporting they have not been paid for their work because of software bugs, unfairly tracked time, unfair feedbacks that make your tasks not accepted.\n\nThis project is the most poorly managed and shady one I've encountered and I've been a freelancer for 12 years now, and it's incredible that assistance is so fragmented and inaccessible. Any freelancing job allows you to work on the projects you want, when you want.\n\nI assure you there are more around, better paid, better managed, much less shady freelancing gigs and I believe it's important for everyone to know that for 1 positive experience you will find 100 negative ones, and that most of the people who keep working there simply are enthusiastic of the up sides because it's their first remote freelancing job.\n\n## Comment ID kwmr9fz with +1 score by [(mullirojndem, Reddit, 2024-03-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1989kbz/scale_ai_post_legit/kwmr9fz/) (in reply to ID 1989kbz):\nI just received a message in the general manner of the one of op's.

That is, in the best scenario, they \"ONLY\" scammed me.\n\nI was contacted via LinkedIn for a recruiter who is not even part of the company (a2i or ScaleAI), was onboarded two weeks ago, and supposedly passed the interview. I've been in bench and haven't been assigned to a Team Leader, there a lot of people in the same situtation.\n\nIn the worst scenario, and after reading all the other answers, they are going after our biometric and identification data; and would be really easy to commit IDENTITY THEFT.\n\n1.- They recorded my \"interview\" (that is, they know how I express and how I talk)\n\n2.- They asked for an oficial identification, government delivered. So they know my address, and have my oficial signature.\n\n3.- And they required validated email and phone, \"for identification and communication purposes\". So they also have this data now.\n\nIn other post, I read they changed the hour rate after some weeks of working for them. In my case, I haven't even started to \"work\", and one of the only oficial communication is that they changed the pay rate, see images.\n\nA lot of people from different countries had the onboading meeting the same day as me, near to 80 people. A lot of them complained they had problems to validate their identity. So, an AI platform had troubles \"reading\" and recognizing the oficial Ids from different nationalities, that's strange. But now they have the oficial identification of a lot of people from lot of countries.\n\nThese three names can be related as the same scam:\n\n1.- g2i: They \"interview\" and \"recruit\" the people\n\n2.- ScaleAI: Supposedly that's the company you would work for, and would pay yo\n\n3.- Outlier: Is the platform they use for us to \"work\"\n\nI'm posting my experience in these other post, related to the same scam.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1989kbz/scale\\_ai\\_post\\_legit/?share\\_id=eUS6jCvHojwbv5va7XvWJ&utm\\_content=2&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=ioscss&utm\\_source=share&utm\\_term=1](https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1989kbz/scale_ai_post_legit/?share_id=eUS6jCvHojwbv5va7XvWJ&utm_content=2&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/outlier\\_ai/comments/1bjkktt/share\\_your\\_experiences\\_so\\_far\\_working\\_with\\_outlier/](https://www.reddit.com/r/outlier_ai/comments/1bjkktt/share_your_experiences_so_far_working_with_outlier/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is\\_outlier\\_legit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1bar4h7/outlier\\_ai\\_training\\_assessment/](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1bar4h7/outlier_ai_training_assessment/)\n\nLooks like in order to effectively work for them, and their Outlier platform is able to measure your work, you would need to install some addons in your explorer.

To keep it short, I just want to invite any \\*professional freelancer\\* to stay away of Scale AI's projects. They may not be 100% scam, but the chaos, disorganization, unprofessional team leaders, all the unpaid extra time needed to keep up to date, the jumps needed to get assistance, the shady tracking time method, the buggy feedbacks that may affect your pay, all of this make this the worst project I've worked on in 12 years. I left running after 3 weeks even knowing I could have made some money... Because I know there is much better and this was everything but a goldmine.\n\nI'm glad some are being paid for their work and are enthusiastic to being making money while studying. And this is exactly what their target should remain: students, fresh graduates who are happy to make some money with flexible time, and for whom 4 hours spent on Remotasks don't equal time you could have invested on another of your clients, or on a better new client. Who don't need to rely on this income, who have large shoulders to endure an often toxic, hostile environment when having some complaints to bring to the team leaders.\n\nBut if you are a professional experienced freelancer you know that those pros (Wow! I can work without a time schedule and make money from wherever I am!) apply to any freelancing job and that there are many projects that are paid WAY better, managed WAY better, with a solid software and project management structure, a smooth workflow, clear information, and project managers and finance team assistants with a name, last name, and a profile picture you can contact whenever you have an issue.\n\nThe fact that after 3 weeks I didn't know one single last name of any of my supervisors, Remotasks assistants and there was no one to whom I could possibly report serious issues within my team, is incredible. The only full name I have is the one of the person who coordinated the 1 hour onboarding meeting, but when I look for her on LinkedIn I don't get any profile matching the role or even the field, and she was not on video during the training, which is also something I've never seen happen before.\n\nI also hope that those who jumped on this project as students/neo grads make sure they do their taxes properly according to your country's law. In my language team, most people who bravely endured (even with enthusiasm!) were people in their early 20s at their very first freelancing job, with no VAT ID and no idea they could and should declare these incomes even without a VAT ID. This can mean great trouble if eventually someone checks on your fiscal situation. It you also take taxes out of the hourly pain (I meant to write hourly pay, but this is such a perfect lapsus that I'm leaving it), and add the extra unpaid time needed to be able to get tasks and be paid for them, you really might consider dogsitting on pawshake as a better investment of your time and energies.\n\n### Comment ID l8062g8 with +1 score by [(seldatak, Reddit, 2024-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1989kbz/scale_ai_post_legit/l8062g8/) (in reply to ID l281erm):\nAll true.

Here is my take on Scale=Remo=Outlier. I see it as a modified version of a Ponzi scheme. They don't have any AI product (and never will). Their only product is human labor (massive amounts of it) that they sell to companies that do have AI platforms like Google, Amazon, Telecoms, large US Government Contractors, etc. This is how the scheme works: they hire (temporarily) large numbers of individuals for their clients' projects trying to underbid other contenders. They recover that by NOT paying all that they promise to the temp workers, but there should be some payouts to continue run the scheme. This is why the platform is so glitchy: they don't have any intent to spend money on ANYTHING and this (glitches) also gives them plausible deniability with respect to \"missing\" payments.  Wang ang Guo just raised $1B for Scale AI. With that much money it should be flawless but it never will because the intent is to get the money and run.\n\n## Comment ID l92ugh7 with +1 score by [(SeniorDescription180, Reddit, 2024-06-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1989kbz/scale_ai_post_legit/l92ugh7/) (in reply to ID 1989kbz):\nI just want to know if it's a scam, or if someone's done something to him after the check-in.\n\n### Comment ID m2bkijm with +1 score by [(Brend_Buth, Reddit, 2024-12-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1989kbz/scale_ai_post_legit/m2bkijm/) (in reply to ID l92ugh7):\nIt is not a scam and they pay on weekly basis if you deliver the work.

The problem is it's total chaos, the software is buggy, the project management is hyper fragmented and getting assistance is a never ending kafkian nightmare. I believe people who were not paid for the onboarding courses weren't because of one of the many bugs people are encountering in the software, in the time tracking, in the payments... Nothing is working smoothly. The idea I have is if you are paid for the course, like I was, and continue working, you start to see all the many issues this project has, and you can decide whether you have time and energies to waste in getting assistance when something is not working or is not paid (spoiler: I ran!). If you are not paid for the onboarding course and you immediately see how hard it is to get assistance, you think it's a 100% scam. I still have to understand what it is, I think it's something in the grey area and much has to do with the complete disorganization that often happens within these giant startups that grew up too quickly and are eager to be ahead of the competition without having the organization and preparation to do it.\n\n### Comment ID kjaa8jy with +1 score by [(Realistic-Respect-41, Reddit, 2024-01-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1989kbz/scale_ai_post_legit/kjaa8jy/) (in reply to ID kiy4ap2):\nI also got a job proposal from them in history, but i'm concerned about whether it is legit or not.

I have to say that Outlier seems completely legit. It's not easy work, and you have to make sure that your task screen is always open so you get paid for time while researching. I will continue to update on my experience but less than two weeks in, I'm convinced it's legit.\n\nORIGINAL THREAD\n\nI just responded to a similar thread, but thought I'd share my experience here, too, because there are a lot more replies on this thread:\n\nI got a LinkedIn from Outlier about this a week ago. They offered me $45/hr to consult on AI LLM as someone with expertise in advanced writing. I skimmed through their alleged 2-3 hour training video (took me about an hour). I successfully completed the assessment (10 questions) last Sunday. They said it would take about 2-3 days (business days I assume) for my assessment responses to be reviewed.\n\nVery early on Thursday morning (just a little longer than 3 bus. days), I received an email saying I passed the assessment and inviting me to do an onboarding or just get started with tasks. Yesterday did a task that took about 20 minutes and today I think I have $17 in earnings showing up in my earnings portal (about right). Incidentally, they also sent me a Google doc that provided me \"feedback\" on my assessment. I reviewed the feedback and generally felt it was reasonable.\n\nOutlier also said they'd pay me $250 to watch the training video and $100 if I passed the assessment ($350 total). I got a separate email today indicating that the training / assessment payment would show up in my earnings portal within 24 hours.\n\nI can keep everyone posted to see if they pay me in a timely fashion. They pay on Tuesdays, so I'm not sure if I'm supposed to get paid this coming Tuesday or the following.\n\nThe Slack channel looks like no one uses it and doesn't seem well thought out.\n\nSo far, while I'm not highly impressed, it doesn't NOT seem legit. I won't do a lot more work until I get paid for the assessment and the task I performed as a trial.\n\nEdit: Wanted to add that the system is a bit glitchy. When taking the assessment, I had to redo one of the 10 questions because there seemed to be a bug. The assessment wasn't that hard, but took about 1.5 hours for me to complete because of the glitch factor. Once I got in a groove, it was easier to breeze through the questions.\n\nI signed up to get paid via PayPal. It didn't require me to provide my PayPal password as someone on this thread had to do. Make sure you have 2FA set up on your PayPal account just in case.\n\n---\n\nHey! I will definitely provide an update. It sounds like a few people have had decent experiences, but most people have had some sort of issue, whether it's not hearing back about the assessment results, not getting paid, or not getting tasks to work on. We'll see how it goes and might work on another task or two this weekend, but really want to wait and see if payment is issued promptly.\n\n### Comment ID kk6kb9u with +1 score by [(ftneek, Reddit, 2024-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1989kbz/scale_ai_post_legit/kk6kb9u/) (in reply to ID kjrdnqn):\nI'm following for an update too\n\n## Comment ID kk7d4i4 with +1 score by [(Substantial-Cake8447, Reddit, 2024-01-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1989kbz/scale_ai_post_legit/kk7d4i4/) (in reply to ID 1989kbz):\nInteresting to have found this thread.

I sent in the resume via the LinkedIn link she sent me, got accepted within a day. I was then instructed to do an assessment and get paid $350. After about a week they sent me an email saying I’d get an extra $50 if I did the assessment within 24 hours so I did and started tasking. The pay was advertised as 40/hour but for me at this time it is about $17 (this is explained on the earnings tab within my personal account, but it is clearly stated that this is a result of my role and experience so I’m sure it varies). I did some tasks Sunday 1/28 and Monday 1/29 for about 2 hours and on Tuesday 1/30 I got $65 to my PayPal from remotask. Still no $400 payment for the assessment though. I wouldn’t say it was a scam because they didn’t take any money from me and I did get paid but I would say it is an extremely unorganized platform \nI’m a grad student so I’m obviously gonna keep working for them for now, but I’ve done a few side hustles in my grad career and will be sure to set aside a good amount for taxes if I keep this up.\n\n### Comment ID ko9rs42 with +1 score by [(AdventurousPie1315, Reddit, 2024-01-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1989kbz/scale_ai_post_legit/ko9rs42/) (in reply to ID ko9qib8):\nAlso want to add that my handshake was from someone at Outlier, I got paid by remotask, and I do my work specifically on the Outlier AI website.

After I lost my work the first time, I started putting everything in a Google Doc and posting it over when I'm ready. There is definitely no rush. They emphasize that they want quality writing and seem to understand that it takes time. But their time clock app tracks what you do while you're logged in. People do get called out if they spend too much company time off task.

People think because a manager isn't standing over them that they aren't being monitored. Separate software monitors whether or not we stay on task. So you have a lot of freedom to sabotage yourself. But really, the projects are so engrossing. If someone's mind/mouse is wandering, they probably don't understand the project.\n\nI also really like the culture.

They are not a scam, but an entity that doesn't communicate, doesn't give feedback, doesn't answer to any concerns, people get kicked out without notice and explanation, has incompetent people working at every level, hired as freelancers for jobs they don't have human qualities to do and so forth... salaries are often late, sometimes a month, they are frequently off by few hours here and there, and bonuses are paid after like 4 months if ever. \n\nAbsolutely the worst company I have ever worked for hands down. \n\nI personally quit, as a highest ranking content writer of my country. I would not suggest this company to anyone unless they are absolutely desperate for money and endure hostile environment and no ability to tell when the work is available or not, or whether they actually get paid or not. The company and managers practice secresy and dismissal, sometimes peer pressure, as a tool to both keep you available but not informed, so they can have you available at your cost whenever it is convenient for them (yes it is a freelancing job, but this is the type where you literally don't matter, at all, in any form). Confronting the higher ups leads to personal attacks. Prepare to be promised work several times in a month for the upcoming day and having to wait for 24 hours for the \"work to start\" when it eventually never does, and no one tells you why, ever, the question is religiously denied. The real reason for the denial is that there was work available, and the managers know this, but the task amount was big enough only for the managers and their closest friends, and nothing was left over to \"officially\" announce it. I know because I have been one who has done these \"behind the backs of others\", courted by a task manager for it, as they didn't manage to deliver quickly enough with their ingroup.\n\nIn the beginning they required from you a minimum of 20 hours a week (or you get kicked out, of course) but then you find yourself hanging in an earlier mentioned loose noose, for several weeks, while being promised work and then reserving time from whatever you were supposed to do, just to sit in front of your computer, waiting for the promised tasks to come, while the managers and their friends work on them already without none of them commenting anything for the entire day, as they are busy doing the tasks behind everyone else's backs. It is understandable that they want to have their share first, but the coercion, lying, attacking and denial, not to mention that you spend 24h waiting for the tasks to come and no one gives you an answer about it as they cannot even estimate whether they get it all done by themselves or not, is the worst. That is why they are silent or outright deny knowing whether the tasks are coming or not, after \"promising\" it first in order to keep enough people as reserve, if the amount is higher than they can handle on their own. The managers will still ask you to vow your allegiance to the company weekly about your availability though, because they want to know for their own neck's sake, that there's enough people available if a bigger task batch appears and the task managers and their cabal cannot handle them all on their own. They never reveal this arrangement and reality of the work, but you get to learn this by time, as the information seeps through accidentally by the people in OH calls at times, meaning that they have been working 12h shifts while officially it has been announced to the task group that there are no tasks available and they have no idea when they would be coming or why they are not coming. The person who accidentally mentioned out loud about them working 12h in a row on the tasks that weren't supposed to \"exists\", got ousted by the two other managers and was gone in a week.\n\nThe company is absolute shit, for any so called \"tasker\" and likely the pyramid is quite rotten much higher than that as well. Good riddance.\n\n### Comment ID kvhjt0f with +1 score by [(LiteratureBasic9064, Reddit, 2024-03-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Upwork/comments/14wvu7i/is_scale_ai_a_scam/kvhjt0f/) (in reply to ID k6hgakb):\nHello, I'm a writer doing a story about scale AI.

I had already quit in the phone with the manager, but this is what they did, in a burst of anger and revenge, right after the call and to justify the removal of the person who basically did half of all the work in the team for the past half a year and profited the company itself the most, but didn't serve the manager's personal purposes. Everyone else than the manager and their friends got screwed over by them. In real life, it wasn't a game or just a side hustle for us, we all depended on the \"minimum 20 hours\" which was required from us in the contract as an allocation, and we had quit and declined other jobs to fulfill that requirement.\n\nThe manager eventually got her less performant friends promoted to other managerial positions too. The fact that they are still working for the company for those bottom feeding salaries, is a statement of their true capabilities and morals as human beings.\n\nAnyway.. the first image in the link is from the weekly payments I got while there was still tasks to do (it's a lot for a single week to earn $800 in this piece of crap line of work, but if you get to the top2 and earn the performing bonuses etc. you could do that in few days) available. The other one is an image of \"the reasons\" the manager assigned to my account after we had already agreed on phone that I will not continue in the line of work because I find the practices unjust and I need to find a work that actually pays me for my presence and efforts.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Vtoro12](https://imgur.com/a/Vtoro12)\n\nMaybe someone finds these useful, maybe not, just know what you're signing up for if you decide to work for them. It's not only the people, it's how the company operates and how the system is structured, which nurtures this behavior and attracts - and keeps - the ugliest fish at the gate-keeping positions, and there's no justice for you, you either join them by rubbing their backs, or you play the game with their rules at your own expense, for their profit, just to feed yourself while tolerating all the crap, OR you quit, just like me and get a real, well paying job, where people respect each other and where your abilities, honesty and willingness to do good and do well, are valued.\n\nJeez I never thought I'd come back to these comments, but it seems like there's some people with morals out there and I wanted to share as much as I could, to at least give some context to the problems the company has, at the actual worker level.\n\n### Comment ID l283gtz with +1 score by [(electrolitebuzz, Reddit, 2024-05-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Upwork/comments/14wvu7i/is_scale_ai_a_scam/l283gtz/) (in reply to ID k6hgakb):\nI just quit and came here to read more experiences and you described my feelings and the idea I have word by word.\n\n> I would not suggest this company to anyone unless they are absolutely desperate for money and endure hostile environment and no ability to tell when the work is available or not, or whether they actually get paid or not.\n\nThis!

I'm not doing great these last months, as I lost two of my biggest clients due to downsizing/geographical reallocations, and was debating whether I should endure this hostile/toxic atmosphere and the unpaid extra time and hassles to make some money for a few weeks until I found again something better, but one morning I woke up, thought of a very aggressive answer I received by a team leader the day before, and another plain toxic exchange I witnessed to on the same day, and just left the slack channels, wrote a ticket asking to delete my account permanently (not sure if it will ever happen since I'm still receiving emails from Remotasks and Slack's chat bot) and I immediately felt a sense of relief and my head felt lighter.\n\nAnd this was before reading all these comments here, on Google reviews, Indeed, UpWork...

Some aspiring youtubers could also need a hand in script writing, so directly contacting and asking is not a bad idea.\n\nWhere to find any open positions like this is another matter. Upwork has been quite dry lately for anything language related and the pay is abhorrent as well, of course, it's Upwork, so if she can contact some local companies for example, with a good resume and something to show, she probably has a better chance for something good. Often the most interesting content writing jobs are \"someone knows someone knows someone\" types of tasks, so maybe attending some local startup hubs wouldn't hurt either: new projects always require some text content, and you find new contacts outside of the initial hub circle as well.\n\nGood luck and I hope she succeeds!\n\n## Comment ID ktzwo7v with +2 score by [(Illustrious_Ad558, Reddit, 2024-03-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Upwork/comments/14wvu7i/is_scale_ai_a_scam/ktzwo7v/) (in reply to ID 14wvu7i):\nI was recently hired by Scale AI/Hire Art and they rescinded a few days before I started, saying I didn't meet the requirements as I don't have an \"english or writing degree.\" From what I am reading here I dodge a bullet and that was likely a lie.

Depending on the language team and your TSMs, your life may be easier. It would have been a cool job to do if it was in May - July, but now it may not be worth that much for your time (considering you are a very good content writer and meticulous about details).\n\n****\n\nI worked for them in 5 months so I may put my 2 cents into the thread. I'm working for a language that is not English, if anyone wondering. The English one may pay more since the company has this \"we are paying according to your country's living wage\", and thus many undeveloped countries get lower pay than Western or European. \n\nBefore August, the payment was timely and didn't lack a cent (since it uses the hours system of Upwork, personally, I have never heard about payment disputes in my country's Slack, but there are a lot of bonus disputes because Upwork has a separated bonus system, and until now I haven't been paid yet for the July - August's bonus, lol). You can get promoted from rating response to rewrite, and the policy changes in August that Rewriters get paid more than Raters. The job was pretty consistent in July until...I guess in August when their budget gets tight and they spend too much that makes them go \"oh fk we need to pay lower and stricter.\n\nHonestly, working for them in June made me realize our project was kind of their first time handling such a big project. Policy changed every week, even every day, when they didn't even know what was the standard for \"good works\" or the format for a good response. \n\nBut anw, the new contract is added in August, lowering the pay rate for Rater. The working time now is completely calculated on a third party's platform and my speculation for why the time is always less than the actual time (if you use another time tracker), it's simply because it doesn't calculate the time you need to switch question, around 10 second for each switch, accumulate this small amount and you get a big one).\n\nAs others have said, with this new contract, the Upwork protection has gone for good and freelancer would be at their accountant's mercy. Personally, I have been paid correctly and only did the payment dispute once time, my total work hours for the new contract are not much though maybe around 100 hours in 3 months (compared with 250 hours in 3 months in the old one). It's because the tasks get sparse and the company employs too many taskers, which makes the tasks run out fast. Things got worse when even Rewriter's rate decreased to half since Sept.\n\nFor communication, absolutely no communication on Upwork, but the TSMs in Slack have been very helpful and passionate in our countries. So I guess it depends on who is your supervisors in this aspect. The \"secret tasks for certain people to do\" is not that sketchy like someone described above me. I was chosen once time and that's because I have good performance. They need good quality for certain tasks. This is just normal practice in my eyes but it's okay if you don't agree.\n\nBut well, everything now has gone downhill with lower pay, no Upwork protection, sparse tasks with sudden announcements and you have to compete with others (or else the tasks would run out quickly and you have nothing left to do), bonus frequently not being paid, and even the bonus rules changed to something that feels like \"impossible\" to achieve. They want you to do very fast work so that they can save money. They start to put pressure on you with more rules and that you can get \"expelled\" from the project if you don't achieve a certain objective. Tbh I feel this is how the world has always worked so I don't mind the objectives, but the low rate for such high objectives is pretty ridiculous now so I put this job in a low priority.\n\n### Comment ID k82f1xm with +1 score by [(MoidTru, Reddit, 2023-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Upwork/comments/14wvu7i/is_scale_ai_a_scam/k82f1xm/) (in reply to ID k80ud50):\nThank you for the reply. Yes they ask the best performing taskers to do the jobs too, but I know for a fact that when everyone has been told \"Still no tasks in sight\", people closest to the task managers have been working on them, and they are not the best performing people. The TSMs have full control over the tasks, meaning they know on a weeks notice when they are coming, but what they don't know is how many tasks per batch there will be. This is why they \"reserve\" you for a week or the very next day, but then might tell you later on there were no tasks, and in worst cases, they don't tell you anything. However, they do contact those taskers that they like or need: When they see they cannot do all the tasks on their own in the given time limitx they DM those who they like, not necessarily those who are the most capable, and ask them to do the tasks. No meritocracy or equally shared opportunities, or even fair competition (which is Scale AI's stance for it, they just want the job done quickly and with certain quality) but a pyramid of back-rubbing and pleasing the TSMs. The system gives full control to gatekeepers through secrecy, and at least in my country, people were using that control, instead of simply letting freelancers to compete on their merits. The TSM's ate from the task batches first, then the people they most liked, then those who performed the best but they didn't like cause they are a direct competition to their friends even to themselves due to their efficiency and ability to claim the bonuses, and the rest, they didn't eat, unless the batch was very big. In worst cases they didn't have any work over a month and they were hired with a 20 - 40h a week contract, and dropped their other work in order to fill that, as 20h was a minimum. When money (tasks) get short, people become selfish, and they cover those who please them, but even they are thrown under the bus eventually if things get worse. It is okay, that is how companies and people work, when this happens, but the lying and gaslighting about the reality of the situation while asking people to allocate their time just for waiting if the crumbs drop after they have eaten is the real problem: they cover their own ass by reserving enough people for the upcoming batch, and then when there are not \"enough\" tasks, in their opinion, for everyone, they don't publicly announce them, but rather do them all themselves or give them through DM's to their friends. Ingroup preference about \"who gets to work and who doesn't\" and it is not done through meritocracy, this is for a fact, I know this because I have gotten the top performing bonuses consistently and yet I knew other people, closest to the TSMs, were working while everyone else was told \"Sorry we don't know when and why the tasks didn't come, but you have chosen this work yourself,  so blame yourself for waiting this entire day in front of your computer for the tasks you were told to prepare for yesterday\" posthumously after they consistently raised the wasted time and hanging in this loose noose as a problem.\n\nHopefully others have had better TSMs. Mine were incompetent and they didn't care about equality neither meritocracy, it was all about social status.\n\n#### Comment ID k848bh2 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Upwork/comments/14wvu7i/is_scale_ai_a_scam/k848bh2/) (in reply to ID k82f1xm):\n[deleted]\n\n## Comment ID kh9x4n7 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Upwork/comments/14wvu7i/is_scale_ai_a_scam/kh9x4n7/) (in reply to ID 14wvu7i):\nLet me apologize that they behaved that way.

After my first missions ended which were already expiring because I was hired a little before they were, it took about 2/3 days to get more. Those were for a different company that only paid for 1hr per 1 task which is the time limit they gave you for the task. For the current one I’m on, I get paid for 2hrs per 1 task which is the time limit given for you to complete 1 task. Onboarding was long, but I didn’t have to write any essays like anyone else which I’m pretty sure is cause that’s for writers and not biologists. \n\nYou only get paid while you’re in the window, so every time you go to another window or close it, that’s when you’re not getting paid. That’s why it’s best to do any necessary research on a phone, iPad, or whatever else you can use that’s not your computer.

There are lots of conversations going on in the Slack group and I’ve got the support I needed. It’s somewhat disorganized in many ways and probably because they’ve hired too many people than they can properly support and also they initiate projects before the guidelines are in place. I’ve had the situation several days in a row where the Slack bot removed me from the project channel and the team lead added me back every morning… I was like wtf. \n\n2. The projects are interesting but you do need to put efforts in them in order to do well. I’ve seen many examples where people tried to cheat with AI on the tasks or simply don’t understand the scope of the project and put in bad quality answers. \n\n3. I’ve gone through several projects now and I think (?) I got promoted to the reviewer team. Instead of working on prompt engineering I now review the tasks other people do. Just wanted to say I’m surprised by how many low quality jobs are out there. People tried to cheat and scam the system and then complain that they got kicked off and didn’t get paid. \n\n4.

Trust me, I've tried everything from survey sites to microtask platforms, usually ending up disappointed and wondering why I wasted my time.\n\nBut I gotta say, Freecash has been a game-changer for me. I was skeptical at first (aren't we all?), but I decided to give it a shot about a week ago. To my surprise, I've already made $109 in just 8 days. It's not gonna make you rich overnight or replace your day job, but for a side gig, it's pretty sweet.\n\nWhat I like about [Freecash.com](https://usefreecash.com/) is the variety of tasks available. The site offers a mix of surveys, offers, and tasks, so you can switch things up when you get bored. I personally enjoy the surveys and some of the game offers. Another great thing is the low payout threshold. You don't have to wait forever to see your earnings. I've already cashed out twice!\n\nThey also offer multiple payment options. You can choose between PayPal, crypto, and gift cards. I've stuck with PayPal so far, but it's nice to have options. The user-friendly interface is a big plus too. It's easy to navigate and find tasks you're interested in. And let's talk about the pay rates - while it varies, I've found the pay to be better than many other sites I've tried.\n\nNow, I'm not saying it's perfect. Some days are better than others, and you might not qualify for every survey. But overall, it's been a positive experience.\n\n### Comment ID lzubkk0 with +1 score by [(Mysterious-Court-372, Reddit, 2024-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/lzubkk0/) (in reply to ID ljzf115):\nFreecash?\n\n## Comment ID ktzyl1q with +17 score by [(LuigiSNK, Reddit, 2024-03-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/ktzyl1q/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\nWriting this comment now to update it in the future. I learned about Outlier through my college's Handshake platform, and I was personally sought out by 'LB' on several occasions to apply for the AI English . I'm not gonna lie, I was very skeptical of it simply because the 40/hr rate seemed too good to be true. I'm still very skeptical and not trying to get my hopes up, but from reading a lot of the comments here, it does seem like the company is legit, albeit disorganized. \n\nI finished my assessment today and almost immediately after, I got a response that I could begin tasking (and that I would be paid 15/hr base rate instead of the 40/hr). I reached out to the Outlier employee who sought me out and asked why this happened and what this meant for me going forward. They didn't respond. A few hours later, I checked the task in my queue and I saw that the base rate for potential earnings now said 40. I thought that this might be a glitch, so I signed out and signed back in several times, but it still said 40 instead of 15. In fact, it still does. And just to be clear, I haven't received a grade yet on my test, and I'm not quite sure if I'll even pass, so seeing the base rate change that quickly was surprising. Well, I guess I'll just have to complete this task and see for myself just how legit Outlier really is. I'll update on whether or not I get paid for the training+assessment (250 for doing this and getting feedback, 350 for doing this and passing) and how much/little of a fluke this 40/hr base rate really is.\n\nUpdate: I'm 2 months in now, and for the longest time, the only pay I received was for the Enablement Program (250). Now, after 2ish weeks of consistent work, I've been paid over 1k, working at a 40/hr rate. I still don't have much trust in this company, given how unresponsive they are with support and just how chaotic their platform is in general. But I'm hoping to ride this out as long as I can because the pay is just that good.\n\n### Comment ID ku7he6v with +11 score by [(LuigiSNK, Reddit, 2024-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/ku7he6v/) (in reply to ID ktzyl1q):\nUpdate!

It will most likely take you longer than the estimated time they put on there, and I'd recommend taking time to go over notes/review thoroughly before taking the exam. I feel like part of my issue was taking the training+test all on the same day w/o reviewing the training materials extensively. I guess at the time, I felt prepared and just wanted to get it over with sooner than later, but spreading it out over a few days might work better!\n\n### Comment ID kub99c6 with +1 score by [(notaniceprincess, Reddit, 2024-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/kub99c6/) (in reply to ID ktzyl1q):\nThis happened to me too, the payment offer is all over the place.

I can't even begin to get into all the shitshow problems since I was \"offered a job\"  2 months ago. SO. MANY. PROBLEMS. I still haven't been paid for my initial training. And their training is a mess. You will get conflicting information via webinars and powerpoints and modules, then you will do the task the way they told you to do it after hours of training, then surprise, that was the wrong way -- now you must take more courses and tests and hope you get paid. You can't reach anyone for anything. The help ticket system is a garbage outsourced mess, wait 3 days for an unhelpful, canned response. They will put you in Slack channels where you can at least talk to/get advice from fellow writers in a watercooler thread and find out if everyone is having the same problems, then one day you wake up and they've removed you from the channel. Why? You don't know. Just because. Then one day you're in another channel. Why? You don't know. The reviewers of your work will say you did your work with the help of AI when you absolutely did not, then you have to do more work without pay to try and make it sound like something else, they give you no guidance on this, they just accuse. The rest of your work could get great reviews but who cares because there's nothing holistic about working for them, it's all literally anything at any time could happen. At one point they had weekly Q&A sessions (but they cancelled those LOL) and they told us verbatim, there will never be a shortage of work, if there is no task in your queue, it means the platform has a glitch. So there is always a glitch I guess. I can't believe how much time I have wasted. Many other people have the same experience, just read the Slack channel for proof, until it disappears. It's wrong to do this to people. Don't offer people gigs and tell them there's neverending work for you when it's a lie and they can't even get started working.\n\n## Comment ID l21mddx with +17 score by [(Recent-Geologist7994, Reddit, 2024-05-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/l21mddx/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\nDo not do it.

I was added to a project that paid more, and a week later I was suddenly removed due to \"low project quality\". (I hadn't even began tasking in this project yet). After continuous attempts to contact support I was removed from the platform with zero explanation as to why.

I completed four \"test\" tasks and got feedback on three and am awaiting feedback on the fourth. Strangely, the one task that I don't have feedback on is the first one I did five days ago. So I am still waiting to figure out if I am moving on to a project. I was paid very quickly, which is nice.\n\nIt can be a bit stressful, as you are asked to write a comprehensive, well-written and thorough response in less than an hour. Often, the prompts can be quite complex, so you have to learn to select easier ones. If you don't get it done in time, it expires and you don't get paid. But no one really explains this to you up front.\n\nMy scores were above the required average. I was on a Slack channel for a specific project then got removed from that. So I have no idea what I am supposed to do, whether I am to be moved to a new project, or what. There is a team lead who seems nice enough, but seems overwhelmed and it's weird to only interact with someone on Slack.\n\n## Comment ID kwfjwc2 with +7 score by [(ShirouAmakusa, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/kwfjwc2/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\nOnboarded and given a high pay rate after passing all exams. Worked 1 hour the first week and was paid (that was fine). Downhill from there.\n\nWorked 20 hours week two, but they only paid me for less than half. They put the rest as \"backfill\" for the next week. So i work 30 hours for week 3, then they suspend and ban me without payment. They owe me money for over 40 hours worked but claim they don't owe money after they're suspended your account. They owe me well over $1500 now.\n\nJuly Update:  \n After contacting reddit user OutlierDotAI about my missing payments, I have finally received the missing payments as well as a $150 onboarding bonus. I know it took months but it was at least a week of full time work at a high pay rate so I am happy with this resolution. I hope that others will have a similar outcome if they are missing payments.

I got the same bad experience with this crazy company. Experiencing issues everyday, no one answering you, lowering rates randomly... And one day, BOOM, I got removed from the project for absolutely no reason. I had worked for almost 3 weeks, 50 hours per week, completed more than 250 tasks, got only exceptional feedbacks and promoted to more responsibilities very quick... But from nowhere one day I got removed from the project (before my 1.2k pay check of the week of course) and no one was telling me anything about why. Just sending me the guidelines, but obviously I knew the guidelines and there was no reason to remove me. Seems like they just randomly remove people, especially if you're making some waves. Has any action been engaged against them? I know a lot of other people currently in my situation, we would be more than happy to take into an action against them and testimony.\n\n### Comment ID la9w9j8 with +2 score by [(Unzeitlich_Mann, Reddit, 2024-06-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/la9w9j8/) (in reply to ID kwfjwc2):\nI also am currently going through a similar experience. I have been bounced around into various tasking projects, where I will do the training, and receive great reviews on all of my work--mostly 4/5, 5/5, but a few 3/5, and one instance each for 1/5 and 2/5. Yet, I would be removed from the tasking project and Slack channels without any reason or explanation. This was going on for about the last 3-4 weeks.\n\nOn June 24, I received a notice saying that my account was flagged for possibly violating Community Guidelines. I submitted a response denying the accusation because I am absolutely positive that I did not violate the rules. I received great reviews and tons of positive feedback. The next day (today) I received an email from the Outlier Team that my account was deactivated for potential fraud. They withheld pay. They require that I submit an email response to dispute the allegation, which I just did. They won't say SPECIFICALLY what the alleged violation is though. They provided a link in the email to the Community Guidelines, but the link is broken--404 message on the page. \n\nThat they are withholding pay for many people, as I am seeing on this channel is illegal. That they are engaging in obvious wage theft by limiting the total amount of time that people will be paid for a task, yet having tasks expire after that time limit, is obvious and clear evidence of wage theft, as people will continue to work on a task past the \"payable time\" (or whatever you would like to call it).\n\nI am going to get in contact with an attorney and sue this scummy company.\n\n## Comment ID kpe9o93 with +7 score by [(NoPhotojournalist939, Reddit, 2024-02-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/kpe9o93/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\nUPDATE: I had consistent tasks for about 5 weeks before being removed from the project with no warning. I submitted a help request and DMs to TL in my domain and project; they said I was removed for quality but I received 0 feedback besides the training prompts.\n\n\n\nYes, it is legit. I've been working with them for the past three weeks. Onboarding and training are a bit difficult as it seems to be a newer project. They have gotten better coding and website accessibility within the last week. It does involve a good amount of mental effort to create prompts and evaluate the responses. It's 1099 so you'll have to do your own tax withholding and they pay weekly through paypal.\n\n### Comment ID kpqrpix with +5 score by [(PerpetualHillman, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/kpqrpix/) (in reply to ID kpe9o93):\nI got lots of tasks the first day and 0 tasks since.

It looks like a tiered system where they'll offer you work at the level they think you can do successfully, and pay you accordingly.

I'm in the middle of my third week.  Applied to just earn some extra cash in the evenings after the kids are in bed, and thought this would be a pretty easy way to do it.  I successfully navigated the convoluted assessment and onboarding steps, and then started tasking (writing prompts in a variety of competencies).  I was getting nearly zero feedback on my prompts and we were told it was a glitch and to continue to submitting - that they'd eventually get caught up and starting reviewing.  \n\nIndeed, the reviewed prompts started coming back to me, but most of the time the feedback only flashed on the screen and then disappeared so you still couldn't submit or make necessary corrections.  Luckily, I did get quite a few approved and submitted those, and then was moved (promoted?) to a reviewer role.  I did the training for that and spent one evening reviewing successfully. \n\nI woke up the next morning and I'd been removed from the project, with a note in Outlier saying I'd submitted a bunch of prompts without them being approved, which was completely untrue.  I also was removed from every Slack thread I'd be on.  I contacted my TL and she said I was removed for low quality which didn't make sense given I'd been moved to a reviewer role.  I've asked her to look into it, but I suspect I'm done.  On the bright side, I did get paid for the 30 hours or so I worked in the last couple of weeks, and did get the $150 onboarding bonus. Oddly, I got paid double for some hours last night, so I've given them a heads up that I got paid incorrectly.  \n\n  \nIt's unfortunate, because I was looking forward to a relatively easy source of side money. I'm an upper middle aged dad with moderate/average tech skills and found the whole platform (including Slack) to be incredibly confusing and chaotic, and the help/feedback you get to be all over the place.\n\n### Comment ID l58dfyw with +3 score by [(The_Original_Brice, Reddit, 2024-05-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/l58dfyw/) (in reply to ID l3a5ase):\nHi SAdadtechnewb, thanks for your post.

Doing a deeper dive on the company name, they are linked to an article in the Washington Post describing 'digital sweat shops' in the Phillippines in 2017 under the name ***Scale AI for Remotetasks*** *https://ihroworld.odoo.com/behind-the-rise-of-artificial-intelligence-is-an-army-of-workers-in-digital-sweatshops.*\n\n***Outlier is part of Scale AI*** which by all intents and purposes is a legitimate company, but by no means ethical or moral with ongoing accusations of digital sweatshops. \n\n[https://scale.com/blog/new-era-outlier](https://scale.com/blog/new-era-outlier)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1989kbz/scale\\_ai\\_post\\_legit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1989kbz/scale_ai_post_legit/)\n\n[https://www.inc.com/sam-blum/its-a-scam-accusations-of-mass-non-payment-grow-against-scale-ais-subsidiary-outlier-ai.html](https://www.inc.com/sam-blum/its-a-scam-accusations-of-mass-non-payment-grow-against-scale-ais-subsidiary-outlier-ai.html)\n\n**The CEO of Scale AI** became the richest 'self-made'  billionaire in the world by age 24 \n\n[https://www.indexventures.com/perspectives/catching-up-with-scale-ai-founder-and-ceo-alexandr-wang/](https://www.indexventures.com/perspectives/catching-up-with-scale-ai-founder-and-ceo-alexandr-wang/)\n\nThey appear to be making the **sweatshop model** global - i guess if you get paid properly you are one of the lucky ones? It's really up to you if you want to risk your time but **this is NOT a reliable source of income by any stretch.**\n\nOn Wikipedia it claims **this company is assisting the US military**...it all *SMELLS FISHY* and tbh if you don't want to assist in the **military industrial complex** i would avoid this company purely based on moral and ethical reasoning.\n\n# Military affiliation\n\n*Scale also has been serving clients in the government such as the* [*United States Armed Forces*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces)*. Scale has pitched itself as a company that will assist the U.S. military in its existential battle with* [*China*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) *by offering to pull better insights out of data, build better AVs and even create chatbots that can help advise military commanders during combat. Wang, who describes himself as a \"China hawk,\" stated the U.S. will not be able to maintain its technological edge over the rising military power of China without AI developed by private technology companies. He was partially influenced by a trip to China in 2018 to see its AI scene and noted how the government there could use commercial technology for its own benefit.*[*^(\\[1\\])*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_AI#cite_note-:1-1)[*^(\\[8\\])*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_AI#cite_note-:6-8)\n\nIf I am honest, given the **founder is Chinese**, it wouldn't surprise me if this entire company was owned by the CCP - With the slave labour and all...it is giving **CCP** vibes. It's a very Chinese maneuver to plant people in their enemy state. The fact he has come out and claimed to be the China Hawk is utterly ridiculous. Trust nothing and NO ONE. The entire world is smoke and mirrors.\n\nI am going to try to find a legit remote work company that pays real wages. It will involve doing real applications and job interview procedures. But that's what it takes to secure real work. **If it's too good to be true, it most likely should be avoided**..

This was pretty vague in the training courses. Some test prompts are a bit jumbled, but you can understand basically what the request is. How can you tell if something is too vague, contradictory, or lacking guidelines to be rated, like a prompt that just asks \"how can I make someone happy\"?  \n3) Similarly, how do you know if a response is \"ratable\" or not? The platform says a response should be \"safe, coherent, devoid of personal information\", so I take that to mean AI responses with harmful language or suggestions, total jumbles of words, or names/addresses etc of humans should be considered \"not ratable\".\n\n## Comment ID l1cqjd9 with +3 score by [(olive_2319, Reddit, 2024-04-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/l1cqjd9/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\nIt's feels like bait-and-switch.

Worked for a week, in what was a confusing mix of \"assessments\" and \"tasks,\" made a few hundred, then it all ended. Nothing for 7 days before they came back with the downgraded $15/hour offer which is a total joke for some of the work -- which at times is intensive and tedious -- you need to put in. In no way is it commensurate with the work you need to do.\n\nIt is extremely frustrating and confusing at times beyond that. The editorial work is often entirely subjective so I guess I was booted off that quick because I wasn't giving them what their models wanted but none of it made much sense. Their tutorials provide a basic level of understanding but the situations that you're working on are mostly far more complicated so you come away puzzled by it all.\n\n## Comment ID l3gvtli with +3 score by [(ShoeniceRevival, Reddit, 2024-05-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/l3gvtli/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\nDon’t waste your time.\n\nI was recruited for the AI model accuracy training piece of the platform and never got paid. \n\nThey promise to pay $140 to complete the training/onboarding - never received.\n\nThen I submitted a request to support about payments and they told me I was suspended for violating community guidelines… \n\nIt’s a scam for free labor.

They don't take the work they do seriously, at least to a good extent, but they expect to get paid for that and get assigned more work. \n\n\nI've been working on tasks with Outlier for a few months now and I was sceptical at first until I actually got paid for completing tasks. The company employs a lot of people but not a lot of people take their tasks seriously. \n\n\nThey have a system to reward people who complete those tasks at the expected standards and will stop assigning tasks to people who submit poor quality tasks or go against community guidelines. \n\n\nAs always with the Internet, it's usually the ones who have a bad experience that often complain and quick to write a negative review but rarely are they honest with themselves enough to take responsibility. \n\n\nTasks are not always available, but if you commit to completing any tasks you get with high quality, the wait between tasks is not as long as some people have claimed. You can be assigned to a different project depending on your performance and sometimes there are few projects available, but you don't have to wait so long if you are consistently giving high quality work. \n\n\nThere's need for a bit more transparency but it's legit and I've gotten paid every Tuesday (arrives Wednesday) as they promised.  \n\n\nAs with everything, experiment for yourself and decide. I didn't do a lot of hours when I started, I just did a few and checked the next week if I will get paid after setting up my payment account. I received the pay and that was enough to convince me.\n\n## Comment ID lnhd6b9 with +3 score by [(Medic_psycho_5693, Reddit, 2024-09-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/lnhd6b9/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\nwhy did they ask for my SIN? isn't this strange to provide my SIN to a random company which claims they pay $25 per hour!!!!\n\n## Comment ID lr7sbbx with +3 score by [(SavlonSpray, Reddit, 2024-10-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/lr7sbbx/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\nHi.

Outlier is on an online scam alert.  I am suspicious.  I started working for Outlier last week, they changed the pay period on my account so that I may not get paid for last week's work until next week.  They are supposed to pay weekly.  This week they are not giving me work.  Lousy instructions, they even make errors on their own work and you are supposed to adhere to their mistakes.  I also was accepted into Outlier Biology, but it does not appear on the board.  Then they use a Slack website that seems like an outdated board.  I am a senior, and this seems like another scam.  It may be legit, but it is suspicious.

And you can see the training sheets were made by either zoomers or AI. The sheer amount of emojis, bad grammar and colorful backdrop are very telling.\nThe info in training sheets is completely nonsensical and conflictiy. You get told that one thing is good, but then later is bad. Like \"do not paraphrase the answer\", next:example of a good justification - a completely paraphrased answer. Or look for objectivity in an answer and suddenly an example of a good answer to a prompt include colloquialisms like \"slay\". I mean, seriously?!\nYou'll waste hours onboarding and then when it's testing time if you fail the test you won't know where you made an error, and you won't be able to retake it. In fact you won't see that project ever again.\nFor me I had to install a VPN, many apps, browser extensions and then when I started a task I couldn't access it as I've never gotten SRT credentials. Yet the timer for tasking was ticking out and lo and behold it run out. I asked in discourse about this and just got kicked out of the channel.

That is, in the best scenario, they \"ONLY\" scammed me.\n\n\n\nI was contacted via LinkedIn for a recruiter who is not even part of the company (a2i or ScaleAI), was onboarded two weeks ago, and supposedly passed the interview. I've been in bench and haven't been assigned to a Team Leader, there a lot of people in the same situtation.\n\n\n\nIn the worst scenario, and after reading all the other answers, they are going after our biometric and identification data; and would be really easy to commit IDENTITY THEFT.\n\n\n\n1.- They recorded my \"interview\" (that is, they know how I express and how I talk)\n\n2.- They asked for an oficial identification, government delivered. So they know my address, and have my oficial signature.\n\n3.- And they required validated email and phone, \"for identification and communication purposes\". So they also have this data now.\n\n\n\nIn other post, I read they changed the hour rate after some weeks of working for them. In my case, I haven't even started to \"work\", and one of the only oficial communication is that they changed the pay rate, see images.\n\n\n\nA lot of people from different countries had the onboading meeting the same day as me, near to 80 people. A lot of them complained they had problems to validate their identity. So, an AI platform had troubles \"reading\" and recognizing the oficial Ids from different nationalities, that's strange. But now they have the oficial identification of a lot of people from lot of countries.\n\n\n\nThese three names can be related as the same scam:\n\n1.- g2i: They \"interview\" and \"recruit\" the people\n\n2.- ScaleAI: Supposedly that's the company you would work for, and would pay yo\n\n3.- Outlier: Is the platform they use for us to \"work\"\n\n\n\nI'm posting my experience in these other post, related to the same scam.\n\n\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1989kbz/scale\\_ai\\_post\\_legit/?share\\_id=eUS6jCvHojwbv5va7XvWJ&utm\\_content=2&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=ioscss&utm\\_source=share&utm\\_term=1](https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1989kbz/scale_ai_post_legit/?share_id=eUS6jCvHojwbv5va7XvWJ&utm_content=2&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1)\n\n\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/outlier\\_ai/comments/1bjkktt/share\\_your\\_experiences\\_so\\_far\\_working\\_with\\_outlier/](https://www.reddit.com/r/outlier_ai/comments/1bjkktt/share_your_experiences_so_far_working_with_outlier/)\n\n\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is\\_outlier\\_legit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/)\n\n\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1bar4h7/outlier\\_ai\\_training\\_assessment/](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1bar4h7/outlier_ai_training_assessment/)\n\n\n\nLooks like in order to effectively work for them, and their Outlier platform is able to measure your work, you would need to install some addons in your explorer.

In reality they all belong to same guy.

Eventually in a few days they will move you to right channel.\n\n-TLs (Team Leader), QMs (Queue Manager i guess..) don't know much. They are mostly old taskers. If you read threads on r/remotework or r/outlier_ai, you will most likely know better than a TL. \n\n-Always close all AI chat tabs on your browser before starting a task. They might assume you were getting help from a chatbot.\n\n-You can have tasks every day, or you can have tasks only a few days in a month. It depends on project/region.\n\n-This shouldn't be your main job, shouldn't be your side job either. Always look for an another job.\n\n-They'll pay you until you got kicked out.\n\n-Probably they don't want you do task for 5-6 hours in a day. There are many people who got messaged for violating terms after doing tasks for all day.

The are about 1400 members there eager to work on something at USD 7.5 per hour. You have to keep an eye on the Slack channel all day because at any moment a QM will post “we need 30 people to work on a project”. Obviously tremendous chaos ensues because everyone needs to put bread on their table, which I find extremely demeaning, almost a violation of Human Rights. If you have to go to pee or to prepare something to eat, by the time you get back those 30 people will have been selected. Forgive the analogy, but it's like throwing some food to a pack of hungry dogs. Isn't there a more dignified way to distribute the work? I don't understand how the International Labour Organization doesn't investigate this type of companies. \n\nIt is extremely unfortunate that Google lends itself to this situation, taking advantage of people's needs. I think we should unite and simply not work when assignments come in if they don't raise the hourly rate, and improve the treatment of workers.

Lack of diversity at the top levels.\n\nI signed up because, in addition to my work in the field of knowledge management,  I like to do freelance developmental editing. I figured training AI would be a way to keep up that skill. But then I discovered all the ways this company exploits workers.\n\nMost younger workers probably wouldn't recognize the signs and just be happy to earn money. But my warning based on history and my own 30 years of work experience: if you support this toxic way of doing business, of doing virtual work-- it will become the primary way business is done everywhere. Then it will be extremely hard to change.\n\nYour labor, minutes of your life given to an employer,  should NEVER be free. You should NEVER be silenced about pay or anything else.

It's cute side gig cash, but I honestly don't know if what I am going through to get the side gig cash is worth it. There's not nearly enough transparency. Pay rates change on a dime without notice, and you spend most of your time without tasks, waiting for a project or waiting for reviews. Considering the time and energy I put into my output, I probably should have made at least $6,000. It cannot be your main job. It's not reliable.

Many of the tasks are done in 1-2 minutes but you get paid by the hour. If you idle, though, you get penalized. Then, I would get assigned to new projects all the time and had to learn all new material. Then there's no reliable feedback system leaving you unable to improve. You may get flagged for low-quality work, which is what happened to me and means you do not get any jobs. I made about 1000 but I highly discourage anyone from working for them. the flexibility sounds nice but the jobs you get are infrequent and for my line of work, the support was horrendous and the platform glitchy.\n\n## Comment ID lfc7tjn with +1 score by [(HoosierHuff, Reddit, 2024-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/lfc7tjn/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\nI've worked with Outlier for about 4 months now.  Not a scam, but there are a lot of intricacies and moving parts that affect your work and pay.  You have to remember that its a freelance role and work is not guaranteed.  Work can abruptly stop for a number of reasons (ending project, poor quality, not qualified, etc.) and you may or may not be notified of the reason, you'll just get an empty task queue.  \n\nIts worth noting, I've always been paid.  They state an hourly rate on a project before you begin working.  However, there is usually a limit on pay per task.  For example, you may get a task with a 60 minute time limit but the project only pays for 30 minutes per task.  If you take 50 minutes to complete the task, you will only get paid for 30 minutes.  If you take 5 minutes, you will only get paid for 5 minutes.  This is almost always stated somewhere before you start working on a project.  Quality here is very important.  Reviews can be biased and subjective at times, but are generally helpful.  \n\nI feel its a good side job, for extra income, but don't be dependent on it for an income stream.  Projects come and go.  You could work for 3 weeks and then have nothing for 2 months.  I think they are trying to get away from using Slack channels and go to a different platform.\n\n## Comment ID lfvblwu with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-07-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/lfvblwu/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\n[deleted]\n\n## Comment ID lh40z3o with +1 score by [(Aeshadave2107, Reddit, 2024-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/lh40z3o/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\nI am already working on Outlier in one domain and applied for another expert domain, which has also been accepted.

The pay rate is supposed to be around $25 per hour, but in reality, I often get rewarded only $7-9 per task because the timer doesn’t reflect the actual hours spent. I’ve dedicated countless hours to learning the materials, but this isn’t the first time I’ve been left feeling disappointed. I keep pushing myself, thinking that maybe the next project will be better. But after all the effort, I still get unfairly graded by reviewers who don't seem to care about accuracy.\n\nI've had system issues in the past, reported them, and even got a BUG ID, but despite that, I was still failed and kicked off the project. The team leads rarely respond, and while I was lucky to have one helpful team lead at one point, it's mostly just been people who don’t seem to care. They’ll open forums for questions, only to lock them so no one can respond or ask for help.\n\nThe company itself has been nothing short of a terrible experience. I’ve wasted so much time learning the materials, convincing myself each time that things will improve. I try to justify it by telling myself that just like commuting to work is unpaid, I can consider the learning as my \"commute time\" before being paid for the tasks. But honestly, it’s been a horrible year full of nothing but frustration. Even when I open tickets for support, they get closed without any resolution or follow-up.\n\n## Comment ID lmtnb8z with +1 score by [(Time_Ranger5840, Reddit, 2024-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/lmtnb8z/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\nI have an important question.

I (CS degree, 25 years of consultancy, programming, corporate trainer, teacher in the industry) applied for some online project work. Submitted by resume to outlier.ai, got an email I wasn't selected, inquired why, no feedback given. Are these folks for real? Did they even read my resume and experience? No feedback, no assessment? It looks like they only recruit script kiddies / students. Then G2i.co, who were looking for RLHF evaluators. Signed up with resume, immediately received an email I was approved. So far so good. Did the very simple onboarding assignment (a Python script for reversing an integer), explained in detail in the video and code comments what was wrong and rewrote it. The test environment had a bug as I couldn't edit a text file that was supposed to be used to explain your reasoning in English. I point that out in the video. My application got rejected, zero feedback on the error or the assignment. Reached out to \"Gabe Greenberg\" via email about this, to no avail. I don't know what is going on with these shady online companies, but they're not transparent, nor any feedback is given and definitely not professional. I'm not going to bother with these 'companies' again.

They accepted me right away without properly assessing anything. There was no real voice assessment or verification – it all felt rushed and automated. The biggest red flag is how much personal information they gathered:\n\n* They asked for my (SIN) – which is something I only share with trusted employers after you get hired not during hiring process. For context, I’m based in Canada and giving away a SIN unnecessarily is a huge deal. I feel I made a mistake here. \n* They collected facial data during onboarding. Now they're moving towards capturing my voice :) I thought it's fun. \n\nWith all this data, they could potentially replicate my identity in the future. The combination of my SIN, facial recognition, and voice data is basically everything someone would need to create another me – or you. It’s extremely unnerving to think about how all of this could be used.\n\nI want to share this because I’ve started to see some others mention scam-like activities around Outlier AI, and I don’t want anyone else to fall into this. If you’re considering joining, please be very careful.

I was one of those hordes of new people they tried to bring onboard as taskers, with specialization in my native Russian. I went though assessment and was found ineligible. I guess with a PhD in social sciences and a BA in linguistics, I am still not very good at small talk which constituted assessment tasks. My answers, I suspect, were not as typecast, straightforward and quick as they expected.\n\n\n\nFor those who will try it, I advise to remember two things. In order to pass the assessment, they will ask for a photo of your ID and a video recording of your face. Not to sound paranoid, but this may be enough for identity theft; it may also constitute an valuable database that they collect. Secondly, be ready to rattle out some simple stories about \"your favorite book\" or \"your favorite holiday\". I am sure many people will feel lost when asked questions like that, especially those who actually like to read and are pressured to answer with the clock ticking.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, I enjoyed leaving a review about a sample of a task that they deemed excellent. It was a sample of creative writing featuring \"a menu from a restaurant in a cats' society\". The menu was written from an entirely human, not cats' perspective, featuring \"garden seasonings\" and puns on words like \"purr-fect\". It has zero reflection on what cats really might like from what is known from animal behavioral science. Mice, for instance, were not on the menu)) Moreover, it was a menu reflecting a middle class snobbish white city dweller's tastes - something like refined, organic, grass-fed, etc.\n\n\n\nThe overall experience was actually reassuring in that it showed to me that AI will not replace humans any time soon. Unfortunately, the usage of AI might make the human race dumber and thinking entirely \"within the box\".\n\n## Comment ID luv96fn with +1 score by [(ControlWilling9447, Reddit, 2024-11-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/luv96fn/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\nPlease can someone tell me, if the message I received from a person with the name of Jean Philippe A, to write in English to train AI bots is legit?

Here are some things to consider.\n\n1. You'll be matched with tasks that do not fit your expertise. I was hired for \"history\" and was given two tasks outside of the history/civics/political thought areas...my expertise.\n\n2. You must follow several instructions and pass a test before proceeding to the task, which is a good idea, especially if you try something outside your comfort zone. I took two of these assignments and failed at both. I won't do that again. \n\n3. The instructions are taught by people who shouldn't be teaching. Instructions are confusing, not thorough in their explanations either in written or video, and do not explain in detail what you'll do in your tasks. Neither are instructors native English speakers, which made it extremely difficult to decipher what they say in videos and their written instructions. I had to rewind two videos 8 to 10 times in certain, critical segments to at least try getting the gist of what they said. \n\nOutlier could be much better if they stuck to matching workers only in their chosen fields, the instructions on tasks were better, the material was more organized, and they didn't employ non-native English speakers in their discussions.\n\n## Comment ID m2e80p4 with +1 score by [(LoneWolf_1984, Reddit, 2024-12-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/m2e80p4/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\nThanks a lot for taking your time doing research and thanks a whole lot for sharing.\n\n## Comment ID m2l1t8m with +1 score by [(nexzae, Reddit, 2024-12-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/m2l1t8m/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\nI have worked for them for less than a week and today the salary is supposed to arrive via PP but hasn't as of yet.\n\n## Comment ID m2sapxf with +1 score by [(bokeleaf, Reddit, 2024-12-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/m2sapxf/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\nit's december 2024, anyone still there?\n\n### Comment ID mb8da1z with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2025-02-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/mb8da1z/) (in reply to ID m2sapxf):\n[removed]\n\n#### Comment ID mb8dq42 with +1 score by [(bokeleaf, Reddit, 2025-02-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/mb8dq42/) (in reply to ID mb8da1z):\nAbout to apply shit lol\n\n## Comment ID m2zo9d3 with +1 score by [(Kakeopedi, Reddit, 2024-12-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/m2zo9d3/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\nSure they are very legit but their enrollment system is a total hack from hell, constantly moving people between projects and do not give feedback.

En primera instancia pensé en que era una estafa, pero me pareció interesante las tarifas de pago, entonces me registré. En segunda instancia me pidieron fotos del carnet, mis sospechas de estafas eran mayores. Sin embargo, quise intentarlo, tuve que enviar mi curriculum y lo envié en español jajaja -se envía en inglés-; hice un video, respondí unas preguntas. Tras eso, quedé en **EQ, que básicamente es quedar sin trabajo** jajaja. A los 3 días me asignaron a un proyecto tarde y me dieron tareas (fue a las 12 de la noche, aclarar que debes hacer las tareas cuando te las den o más gente puede hacerlas y te quedarás sin trabajo), debo dejar en claro que no me asignaron ningún curso y a lo largo del mes nunca he hecho ninguno -no sé si esto se deba a que soy profesional-, solo me dieron dos **Assessment Task que son tareas de evaluación (estas es un pago inferior, 3.5 dólares por hora proporcional al tiempo trabajado)** y al terminar inmediatamente me dieron tareas. **Me pagaron 7,50 dólares la hora** \\-atención, no te apures, no te pagan por tareas, te pagan por hora, es decir si trabajas 30 minutos te pagan 3,75, pero tampoco lo hagas lento, ya que pueden entender que estas \"dando la hora\"-. Ese día trabajé un poco más de 4 horas o sea más de 30 dólares. Sin embargo, como nunca realicé algún curso, no me di cuenta que mi rol asignado era de **revisor** que significa revisar las respuestas de la IA ante determinadas preguntas que hacen otras personas de Outlier para hacer fallar a la IA (eso también se revisa y evalúa). Cometí el grave error de justificar mi evaluación a la respuesta de la IA en Español, **se hace en INGLÉS**. No obstante, a los tres días me dieron más tareas, trabajé más de 5 horas, hice casi 40 dólares. Al parecer terminó ese proyecto y desde entonces llevo casi 3 semanas en EQ -sin tareas-. Bueno, igual contento porque gané en dos días de trabajo 70 dólares **-los pagos que hiciste durante la semana se procesan los martes, pero el pago llega a tu cuenta de PAYPAL los miércoles** alrededor de las 1 de la tarde.  \nDebo decir que mucha gente en el foro de Outlier se queja porque les **asignan muchos cursos que no son pagados y no les dan ninguna tarea,** es importante que respondas bien todo, infórmate en el foro o en las OH que básicamente son reuniones de trabajo para que un QM responda dudas -**un QM es el jefe del proyecto al que te asignen**\\- o aclare ciertas imperfecciones del trabajo dentro del proyecto. Debes saber que si quedas en EQ **ninguna persona puede asignarte un proyecto o tareas**, eso lo hace el sistema.  \nAdemás, si eres de Chile puedes aplicar como experto en matemáticas, programación o como hablante nativo para hacer lo que te expliqué recién. Es importante que escojas bien porque después NO te puedes cambiar.  \nAhora que te informé, **¿me podrías ayudar registrándote con mi link de referidos?** si no me deja publicarlo acá, pídemelo por el chat, este es el link:  \n[https://app.outlier.ai/expert/opportunities?utm\\_source=referral&referring\\_user=dab1c9761cdf1df6fb0dfa5b86f861a72af9a1cec0ec83d24064ab4d0e67b8ab46f0107d8ef0abffa36ec132cbb337b8](https://app.outlier.ai/expert/opportunities?utm_source=referral&referring_user=dab1c9761cdf1df6fb0dfa5b86f861a72af9a1cec0ec83d24064ab4d0e67b8ab46f0107d8ef0abffa36ec132cbb337b8)\n\n### Comment ID m67dvvz with +1 score by [(ZombieMany9665, Reddit, 2025-01-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/m67dvvz/) (in reply to ID m4bywzr):\nSorry bro, nobody will read your post.\n\n#### Comment ID m697bdo with +1 score by [(almxmhappy, Reddit, 2025-01-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/m697bdo/) (in reply to ID m67dvvz):\nI think you're mistaken, I've got 3 referrals with this post, and I also helped my Latino friends with information.\n\n#### Comment ID m697mb2 with +1 score by [(almxmhappy, Reddit, 2025-01-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/m697mb2/) (in reply to ID m67dvvz):\nAnd I only had to copy and paste, cheers haha!\n\n### Comment ID mc3z1fv with +1 score by [(Opposite-Storm8691, Reddit, 2025-02-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/mc3z1fv/) (in reply to ID m4bywzr):\nyo lo leí, ce hache i\n\n## Comment ID m4q7yh0 with +1 score by [(PlusProfession8378, Reddit, 2024-12-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/m4q7yh0/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\nI can confirm they are Legit.  \nI get paid 28$/H in Sweden.\n\nI've been grinding the last week and will get $1400 tomorrow.  \nI've worked around 3-4 hours per day. completed 4 missions that gave in total around 350$ bonus.\n\nNot bad for only 1 week!\n\nHowever this isn't like a regular \"survey-site\".

I came across it in a FB Ad where it advertised a EUR33/h salary. First of all, if any projects available, I only got US$29 (also interesting that the currency isn't even adjusted on the platform, but they do put in the work to adjust it in the ad\\^\\^) max. I did work for about a week, informed them of my upcoming travel, which was approved. And, once I got to my new country, I got locked out of my account, saying that I need to submit verification (which I already did when I created the account) and support has been of no help. They just keep saying I should log in (thanks!\\^\\^) and a member of their team is going to get back to me but nobody has helped. I just keep getting the same instructions over and over again that don't work. And, yes, I already tried multiple browsers and deleting cache & cookies. In a nutshell, there is no support available, they can cut off your access to your account anytime and withhold any payment - I still haven't received my last payment for work that I did!\n\n## Comment ID m8qsbk8 with +1 score by [(No-Application-9365, Reddit, 2025-01-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/m8qsbk8/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\nI would be cautious about messages like this. \"Outlier\" has been linked to AI-related companies and gigs before, but many of these types of offers can be scams or low-quality freelance opportunities.

If, for example, they use your translation in a way that infringes on someone’s rights, you could be on the hook financially.\n\t2.\tLimited Liability for Outlier – Even if they do something wrong, their liability is capped at $1,000 or what they’ve paid you in the last 12 months—whichever is higher. Meanwhile, your liability seems unlimited.\n\t3.\tMandatory Arbitration & Class Action Waiver – If they don’t pay you or treat you unfairly, you can’t sue them in court (except in small claims court if applicable). Arbitration is often expensive and favors companies over individuals.\n\t4.\tThey Can Terminate You at Any Time – They can cut you off without notice and without a clear reason, meaning you have no real job security.\n\t5.\tText Messaging & Calls – They can contact you for marketing, which might mean they share or sell your contact info.\n\nThat’s where I thought it’s not for me.\n\nStay safe.\n\n## Comment ID mew9k2z with +1 score by [(Asleep_Razzmatazz757, Reddit, 2025-02-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/mew9k2z/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\nPlease help\n\n## Comment ID mew9l66 with +1 score by [(Asleep_Razzmatazz757, Reddit, 2025-02-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/mew9l66/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\nY\n\n## Comment ID mf2vott with +1 score by [(Gregory_ZET, Reddit, 2025-02-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/mf2vott/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\nWas approached by them via Upwork.

Apparently I passed it.\n\n\\- Finally procced to first supposedly paid task. Write my prompt. Edit model response. Model does not update, just freezes. \n\n\\- Read about this bug in Slack, and am asked to submit a task ID and a recording of the bug. Obviously I don't want to submit a screen recording to some random slack channel with 1000s of random people for a company that hasn't even paid me yet. \n\nDoubtful that I will get paid for the time I spent dealing with their broken system. Presumably I will fail this first task because the model simply doesn't work.

They hire hundreds of people with almost no vetting; give unclear instructions which change from day to day; their platform is constantly bugging out which will sometimes result in you wasting time that you won't be paid for (except possibly after complaining); their system frequently threatens to \"disable you from the platform\" (i.e. *fire you*) when you make mistakes, and there is basically no way to practice to make sure that you are doing the job correctly before you start.\n\nHowever, they really do pay you for the work. The pay is good, and job is not that hard. You can basically work for 30-60 min whenever you want. The job security is as low as you can possibly imagine, but it's been a pretty nice side-gig for me so far.\n\nBased on other people's comments, there seems to be a lot of variability in pay and work structure depending on the project you work on. At least for me, they pay the advertised rate, and also give out quite a few bonuses.\n\n### Comment ID l05rqux with +1 score by [(violetfairiedust, Reddit, 2024-04-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/l05rqux/) (in reply to ID kt2wkbg):\n1 hour training took me 15 mins.\n\n### Comment ID l4jt16y with +1 score by [(SuperTangelo1898, Reddit, 2024-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/l4jt16y/) (in reply to ID kt2wkbg):\nwhenever I was able to complete a task, which was about 1/3 or 1/4 of the tasks, I was paid. but I wasted a ton of time working on tasks without pay, so task at your own risk\n\n## Comment ID kt6jlhe with +1 score by [(Strikelow, Reddit, 2024-03-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/kt6jlhe/) (in reply to ID 1ajwg1n):\nIt’s legit, been working for them for about a month now and they are finally starting to get it together, especially if you’re on the coding team as a platinum coder.\n\n### Comment ID kw4hyc0 with +1 score by [(Neat_Bathroom139, Reddit, 2024-03-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ajwg1n/is_outlier_legit/kw4hyc0/) (in reply to ID kt6jlhe):\nIs it possible to get promoted from a generalist writer to a platinum coder?",

Scale AI just launched their [SEAL Leaderboards](https://scale.com/blog/leaderboard?utm_source=bensbites&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=scale-ai-s-new-leaderboard-bring-trust-to-llm-rankings) to rank LLMs using unbiased data and expert evaluation.\n\nThe SEAL Leaderboards give us a clearer picture of how these models actually perform.\n\nThey also address a major hurdle in AI development: the race to the bottom caused by companies manipulating benchmarks to make their LLMs appear better. This often leads to contamination and overfitting, where models learn to perform well on specific tests but struggle in real-world applications.\n\nSEAL's private datasets and rigorous evaluation methods aim to prevent these issues, ensuring the Leaderboards provide a trustworthy picture of LLM capabilities.\n\nIf you're looking for the latest AI news, it breaks [here first](https://solansync.beehiiv.com/).\n\n## Comment ID l6cabg6 with +3 score by [(Open_Channel_8626, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1d45z1f/scale_ais_new_leaderboard_bring_trust_to_llm/l6cabg6/) (in reply to ID 1d45z1f):\nGemini 1.5 Pro coming 3rd in coding is interesting\n\n### Comment ID l6eo35o with +1 score by [(ViveIn, Reddit, 2024-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1d45z1f/scale_ais_new_leaderboard_bring_trust_to_llm/l6eo35o/) (in reply to ID l6cabg6):\nWhy?\n\n#### Comment ID l6g7xhv with +5 score by [(Open_Channel_8626, Reddit, 2024-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1d45z1f/scale_ais_new_leaderboard_bring_trust_to_llm/l6g7xhv/) (in reply to ID l6eo35o):\nIt’s not commonly seen that way\n\n### Comment ID lpowu78 with +1 score by [(ai_did_my_homework, Reddit, 2024-09-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1d45z1f/scale_ais_new_leaderboard_bring_trust_to_llm/lpowu78/) (in reply to ID l6cabg6):\nThis didn't age well\n\n#### Comment ID lpozsjr with +1 score by [(Open_Channel_8626, Reddit, 2024-09-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1d45z1f/scale_ais_new_leaderboard_bring_trust_to_llm/lpozsjr/) (in reply to ID lpowu78):\nHaha yeah\n\n## Comment ID l6e6wpu with +3 score by [(soupcanninja, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1d45z1f/scale_ais_new_leaderboard_bring_trust_to_llm/l6e6wpu/) (in reply to ID 1d45z1f):\nThem having GPT-4o as #1 for instruction following is a joke and I can’t help but feel it invalidates the rest of the leaderboard. 4o is so laughably bad at following complex instructions I abandoned several of the custom GPTs I had built recently because 4o simply can’t follow their workflows anymore.\n\n### Comment ID l6eo550 with +2 score by [(ViveIn, Reddit, 2024-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1d45z1f/scale_ais_new_leaderboard_bring_trust_to_llm/l6eo550/) (in reply to ID l6e6wpu):\nYeah 4o hasn’t really impressed me either.\n\n#### Comment ID l6eonjo with +1 score by [(soupcanninja, Reddit, 2024-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1d45z1f/scale_ais_new_leaderboard_bring_trust_to_llm/l6eonjo/) (in reply to ID l6eo550):\nIt does great at a few things but it def struggles at most others.

But I came across [this](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0jFd4L8nvDROu05lk2kv6y?si=c508f318c7074fa7) episode today on Patrick O'Shaughnessy's *Invest Like the Best* podcast, where he meets with the CEO of [Scale AI](https://scale.com/?utm_location=9067609&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=13660454567&utm_term=scale%20ai&hsa_acc=8100071054&hsa_cam=13660454567&hsa_grp=129772332691&hsa_ad=547933569299&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-490460185097&hsa_kw=scale%20ai&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhbiS3vyO9wIVAfrICh0BqAobEAAYASAAEgIfk_D_BwE).

Palantir wasn't included.  I'm guessing this is because Palantir is their major competitor, but I'm wondering if any of the more knowledgeable or technically minded investors on this sub could offer some input. \n\nIs Scale a Palantir competitor?

They offered us $50/hr and brought us on board without any interview or even a video call.  It was just \"Here's the instructions to set setup and join the slack\". Once in the slack, it was only 1 or 2 mods managing hundreds of taskers. At times, weeks or months would go by with no replies from Admins on important topics like missing payments, how to task properly, and invaluable feedback that comp sci PhDs were suggesting about their current processes. Fwiw, glassdoor reviews also reveal that Alex is a bit of an a-hole CEO, ridiculing any constructive criticism.\n\n\\- **Messy Payroll / Poor Budgeting.** Personally, I know dozens of co-taskers who are still missing pay that they should have received. This is after months of asking and submitting several google forms that document the missing payments. For the most part, they just keep getting ghosted by admins and scale employees. Want further evidence? Just look at their linkedIn postings where they're paying to advertise a \"Head of Payroll\" position. Personally, I've noticed very obvious accounting errors in their hour tracking systems like pay 0 hours if you task past midnight but they ARE implementing better solutions.\n\n\\- **Misleading Communications**. The contract they used to bring us on contained several inaccuracies and the \"incentive pay\" they promise in the contract is not always honored. For example, the contract says a limit on hours unless approved. But admins and Scale employees verbally confirm there's \"no maximum hours\" all the time, but at times they abruptly reversed this promise. They also lowered the hourly rate recently.\n\n\\- **Legal risk.** Due to the problems above, i would not be surprised if a huge lawsuit arises in the future. They do a good job of hiding the evidence though because all communications are via slack and they delete channels, and use the free version of Slack so you cannot access older messages/convos. That said, some of their Slack workspaces contain hundreds of thousands of taskers.\n\n\\- **Botting risk** \\- I've heard stories of people using chatGPT or possibly bots to \"train\" the models and get around the time tracking software.\n\n**Conclusion** In all honesty, I want Scale to do better because my paychecks are linked to the success of their company. I'm even hesitant to post this because I'd rather not them lose the high paying client for the project i'm working on...if they lose that client, I'd prob lose the job.  On the other hand, I feel that it's the right thing to do because this transparency is needed for outsiders. PLus it's proven near impossible to have this feedback taken seriously by the company (at least from a tasker role).\n\n## Comment ID i4gdjt7 with +7 score by [(BernardoDeGalvez, Reddit, 2022-04-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PLTR/comments/u23qve/palantir_vs_scale_ai_thoughts/i4gdjt7/) (in reply to ID u23qve):\nPalantir has no real competition\n\n### Comment ID i4ggdx0 with +16 score by [(mhkwar56, Reddit, 2022-04-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PLTR/comments/u23qve/palantir_vs_scale_ai_thoughts/i4ggdx0/) (in reply to ID i4gdjt7):\nSo I hear.

Burnt out? They'll let you go.\n\n- Wizard of the Oz effect: the CEO's job is to make sure Scale looks good. What happens inside the company and how poorly run the organization is will make anybody scream. Project quality is terrible, and our customers know it.

After filling out the form they ghosted everyone, and 3 months later nobody has heard from them. Some of the other employees had also just moved to Austin for the job and were put in a bad situation. Even before that there was no transparency and little feedback which made it hard to be able to effectively do your job. Even beyond the poor work environment and shady management the fact that they suddenly had to close an office, only weeks after moving in, makes me think that the company is headed in a bad direction.",

          "cons": "Cons below may not apply to other roles \n\nTerrible WLB - on the client-facing ops side, many people work 80+ hours and weekend work is typical. I have been in this role for 6+ months and haven't seen any material improvement. There's a lot of lip service like \"improving WLB is top of mind\" but no change after months lol\n\nTedious work and limited learning - I spend lots of time on tedious and meaningless work because our tooling and infrastructure are bad. Examples include: trying to figure out why contractors didn't get paid; trying to figure out why contractors don't see work; reviewing data labeling work; fighting different people to get (and keep) the contractors for my projects; updating 10 different trackers for various stakeholders and many more\n\nLimited upward mobility - the org structure fundamentally doesn't allow most people to move up. We have an \"inverse T\" structure where we have many people at the bottom, no one in the middle, and very few at the top. It's simply impossible for people to move up with this org structure vs a more typical pyramid structure\n\nImmature leadership - many people in leadership positions have never gone through a mature organization. They tend to be strong ICs but their leadership skills are questionable. For example, a good leader would care about the onboarding experience of new employees but what I saw was we frequently put new folks to do things that they had never done before with very little support \n\nLies and broken promises - just two examples: we used to paint a very different story about the job in the interview. We stopped doing this after realizing people would leave quickly when they found out about the lie. We also used to tell candidates that they could get 200% of their base as bonus but in reality, the vast majority get 50% or less and the bonus is delayed by 4-6 months.\n\nSuccess is not rewarded but failures are heavily punished - we are basically incentivized to do as little as possible. The more I do, the more likely something will go wrong (since many things are out of my control). If I don't get rewarded for the success and only get punished for the failures, why should I go above and beyond?",

        "cons": "Cons below may not apply to other roles \n\nTerrible WLB - on the client-facing ops side, many people work 80+ hours and weekend work is typical. I have been in this role for 6+ months and haven't seen any material improvement. There's a lot of lip service like \"improving WLB is top of mind\" but no change after months lol\n\nTedious work and limited learning - I spend lots of time on tedious and meaningless work because our tooling and infrastructure are bad. Examples include: trying to figure out why contractors didn't get paid; trying to figure out why contractors don't see work; reviewing data labeling work; fighting different people to get (and keep) the contractors for my projects; updating 10 different trackers for various stakeholders and many more\n\nLimited upward mobility - the org structure fundamentally doesn't allow most people to move up. We have an \"inverse T\" structure where we have many people at the bottom, no one in the middle, and very few at the top. It's simply impossible for people to move up with this org structure vs a more typical pyramid structure\n\nImmature leadership - many people in leadership positions have never gone through a mature organization. They tend to be strong ICs but their leadership skills are questionable. For example, a good leader would care about the onboarding experience of new employees but what I saw was we frequently put new folks to do things that they had never done before with very little support \n\nLies and broken promises - just two examples: we used to paint a very different story about the job in the interview. We stopped doing this after realizing people would leave quickly when they found out about the lie. We also used to tell candidates that they could get 200% of their base as bonus but in reality, the vast majority get 50% or less and the bonus is delayed by 4-6 months.\n\nSuccess is not rewarded but failures are heavily punished - we are basically incentivized to do as little as possible. The more I do, the more likely something will go wrong (since many things are out of my control). If I don't get rewarded for the success and only get punished for the failures, why should I go above and beyond?",

      "# [Amazon, Meta back Scale AI in $1 billion funding deal that values firm at $14 billion by Riley de León, www.facebook.com on 2024-05-21](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/21/amazon-meta-back-scale-ai-in-1-billion-funding-deal.html)\nArtificial intelligence startup Scale AI said Tuesday that it has raised $1 billion in a Series F funding round that values the enterprise tech company at $13.8 billion — almost double its last reported valuation. The San Francisco-based company, ranked No. 12 on this year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list, has now raised $1.6 billion to date.\n\nIts latest funding round is being led by Accel, and includes Cisco Investments, DFJ Growth, Intel Capital, ServiceNow Ventures, AMD Ventures, WCM, Amazon, Elad Gil (co-founder of Color Genomics and serial tech investor), and Meta, all of which are new investors in the company.\n\nExisting investors including Y Combinator, Nat Friedman, Index Ventures, Founders Fund, Coatue, Thrive Capital, Spark Capital, Nvidia, Tiger Global Management, Greenoaks, and Wellington Management also participated in the round.\n\nScale AI is playing a key role in the rise of generative artificial intelligence and large language models, with the data — whether it is text, images, video or voice recordings — needing to be labeled correctly before it can be digested and used effectively by AI technology. Scale AI has evolved from labeling data used to train models that powered autonomous driving to now helping to improve and fine tune the underlying data for nearly any organization looking to implement AI, powering some of the most advanced models in use.\n\n\"Our calling is to build the data foundry for AI, and with today's funding, we're moving into the next phase of that journey – accelerating the abundance of frontier data that will pave our road to AGI,\" founder and CEO Alexandr Wang said in a statement announcing the news.\n\nScale AI is also increasingly working with the public sector.\n\nIn August, the company was awarded a contract with the Department of Defense Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office, which the company said will help boost the DoD's efforts to advance AI capabilities for the entire military, spanning projects across the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Space Force and Coast Guard.\n\nIn May, Scale AI launched Donovan, an AI-powered decision-making platform that is the first LLM deployed to a U.S. government classified network.\n\nWang spoke at December's AI Insight Forum in Washington, D.C., about the role Scale AI is playing in helping support the U.S. and its allies.\n\n\"The race for AI global leadership is well underway, and our nation's ability to efficiently adopt and implement AI will define the future of warfare,\" he said. \"I firmly believe that the United States has the ability to lead the world in AI adoption to support U.S. national security. The world is not slowing down, and we must rise to the occasion.\"\n\nThe company is also looking to play a role in AI development globally. It announced in May that it will open a London office as its European headquarters and will look to support and partner with the U.K. government on its AI initiatives.\n\nSign up for our weekly, original newsletter that goes beyond the annual Disruptor 50 list, offering a closer look at list-making companies and their innovative founders.",
      "# [America Must Win the AI War](https://scale.com/blog/win-the-ai-war)\nBelow is a letter outlining five steps that the new Administration should take to drive the United States toward victory. This letter will be shared with the President and Congressional and tech leaders.\n\nMr. President,\n\nCongratulations on your historic inauguration as the 47th President of the United States. As you know, this is a critical time for the United States as our global leadership on Artificial Intelligence (AI) is at risk. We are in a new kind of technological arms race. The Chinese government is investing in AI at an unprecedented pace. In 2023, Chinese AI models were more than a year behind, but this is no longer the case. In the past month alone we have seen very powerful advances in China’s AI capabilities relative to our government. If the United States remains on our current trajectory, we risk falling and staying behind.\n\nIn your first Administration, the actions you took enabled the growth of American AI companies and set the stage for the mainstream AI boom we are seeing now. Scale AI has powered nearly every AI advancement over that period with leading AI labs and enterprises. We’ve also brought that same expertise to support the Department of Defense and other national security stakeholders to protect American interests, and to ensure the United States continues to lead on critical new AI innovation. Scale’s foundational role in the AI ecosystem gives us unique insights into how any government or enterprise can adopt AI efficiently and effectively.\n\nIf the United States wants to win the AI war, here are five steps your administration can take, beginning in your first 100 days, to drive the United States toward victory:\n\nAllocate America’s AI investments in the right places. China’s government outspends our government by about 10 times on AI implementation and adoption. AI progress relies on three pillars: compute, algorithms, and data. The leading global tech companies have long recognized this by investing approximately 60% on compute, 30% on data, and 10% on algorithms. This formula is why American commercial AI systems are the best in the world and why China benchmarks its government spending against us. In contrast, our government spends roughly 90% of investments on algorithms, neglecting the other two pillars. So not only are we spending less, we’re not investing well. To win, our government must adapt by changing our investment strategy to more closely reflect industry. Then we must not only match, but exceed China’s aggressive funding for AI focused on fielding and implementing AI solutions.\n\nBuild the workforce of the future in America. Estimates suggest that AI will create up to 50 million new jobs and provide up to $15.7 trillion of global economic output by 2030. To capture as much of this economic potential as possible and create jobs within our borders, the Administration should establish an interagency task force charged with immediately reviewing all relevant regulations to ensure that the AI workforce of the future can flourish in the United States.\n\nMake all federal agencies AI-ready: There is incredible evidence about how AI can improve government efficiency, decision-making, and service delivery. Unfortunately, one major barrier to realizing these gains is that government data is not optimized to support AI. While the United States’ government is the largest producer of data in the world, its benefits to defense, economic growth, health care and operational efficiency have not been realized. To address this, executive action on AI should require our agencies to become fully AI-ready by 2027.\n\nUnleash American energy to support the AI boom. The energy demands needed to support the AI boom are substantial. To unlock the potential for economic growth, enhance national security, and increase productivity from AI systems, our government must have energy policies in place to ensure sufficient energy. In the first 100 days, the newly created National Energy Council should launch an aggressive energy plan to produce the lowest-cost energy and electricity globally.\n\nEnsure safety without stifling innovation. Attracting the best tech companies to flourish in America relies on the right regulatory framework. For AI, this is achieved through a sector-specific, use-case-based approach and by testing frontier AI models and system to address unforeseen risks. To ensure that this approach is in place, the White House should direct agency heads to perform a gap analysis of where existing AI regulations apply and where they may require new ones. And the National Institute of Standards and Technology should be tasked with developing standards and frameworks to test and evaluate AI systems. Together, these actions can create a regulatory framework that maintains safety without undermining long-term growth or national security.\n\nThere is much work to be done, and you have the right team in place to take on this challenge and ensure we maintain our lead against adversaries. Scale stands ready to be a partner to you and the Administration so that America wins the AI war.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlexandr Wang\n\nFounder and CEO\n\nScale AI",
      "# [Scale AI unveils ‘Defense Llama’ large language model for national security users by Brandi Vincent on 2024-11-04](https://defensescoop.com/2024/11/04/scale-ai-unveils-defense-llama-large-language-model-llm-national-security-users/)\nCredentialed U.S. military and national security officials are experimenting and engaging in multiple classified environments with Defense Llama — a powerful new large language model that Scale AI configured and fine-tuned over the last year from Meta’s Llama 3 LLM — to adopt generative AI for their distinctive missions, like combat planning and intelligence operations.\n\nDan Tadross, Scale AI’s head of federal delivery and a Marine Corps reservist, briefed DefenseScoop on the making and envisioned impacts of this new custom-for-the-military model in an exclusive interview and technology demonstration on Monday.\n\n“There are already some users from combatant commands and other military groups that are able to leverage this on certain networks,” he explained at Scale AI’s office in Washington.\n\nLarge language models and the overarching field of generative AI encompass emerging and already-disruptive technologies that can produce (convincing but not always accurate) text, software code, images and other media — based on human prompts.\n\nThis quickly evolving realm presents major opportunities for the Defense Department, while simultaneously posing uncertain and serious potential challenges.\n\nLast year, Pentagon leadership formed a temporary task force to accelerate DOD components’ grasp, oversight and deployments of generative AI. More recently, the department and other agencies were delivered new directives regarding pursuing the advanced technology in various provisions in the Biden administration’s new National Security Memo (NSM) on AI issued last month.\n\n“We are still looking at ways to provide more enterprise support, especially as things like the NSM that was just released. That’s one of the areas that we’re leaning forward on being able to try and help support the DOD’s adoption of this technology, again, in a responsible manner,” Tadross said.\n\nNotably, Scale AI’s demo occurred the same day that Meta revealed that it’s making its Llama models available to U.S. government agencies — and explicitly those that are working on defense and national security applications — with support from other commercial partners including Scale AI. Also on Monday, OpenAI unveiled its first limited ChatGPT Enterprise partnership with DOD, which will enable its generative capabilities’ use on unclassified systems and data.\n\nThese announcements follow research and reports that recently surfaced suggesting that Chinese researchers linked to the People’s Liberation Army applied Meta’s open source Llama model to create an AI asset that presents the possibility for military applications.\n\n“There’s always a concern [about] the risk appetite. My perspective on this is that the risk of not adopting these technologies is actually greater than adopting them in a measured and responsible way,” Tadross told DefenseScoop.\n\nIn some ways, he said, Scale AI’s Defense Llama stems from the company’s still-unfolding test and evaluation and other experimental efforts with DOD partners in combatant commands and at Marine Corps University’s School of Advanced Warfighting.\n\n“We found that there are instances where a DOD member or any government official is going to ask a question that would not get a good response from the model,” Tadross said.\n\n“This is because if you build these models off of the plethora of information that’s on the internet, and then also are tuning it for the use cases that are best commercialized … there are protections that are put in place to ensure that they are used responsibly, [including] making sure that they don’t respond about warfare, about drug use, about human trafficking, things like this that make all the sense in the world, to ensure that they don’t go haywire and start answering all those questions to the general population,” he said.\n\nBut once LLMs were safely configured for use and experimentation by trained and approved government officials on DOD’s classified and more secure networks, Tadross explained, the models still “refused” to fully address certain prompts about warfare planning and other defense topics.\n\n“We needed to figure out a way to get around those refusals in order to act. Because if you’re a military officer and you’re trying to do something, even in an exercise, and it responds with ‘You should seek a diplomatic solution,’ you will get very upset. You slam the laptop closed,” he said.\n\n“So we needed to find a way to minimize those refusals and ensure that it is not only doing that, but also answering the tone that would be useful — because if it’s like this very informal social media-type tone, it doesn’t instill a lot of confidence in its response,” he said.\n\nTadross and his team trained Defense Llama on a sprawling dataset that pulled together military doctrine, international humanitarian law, and relevant policies that align with the Pentagon’s rules for armed conflict and ethical principles for AI.\n\nThe engineering process known as supervised fine-tuning was applied. And to inform the model’s tone, officials applied reinforcement learning with human feedback methods.\n\n“You get a response and then you provide the type of response that you would have preferred. So because the intelligence community has already written style guides for how to write, we just built a lot of examples based off that,” Tadross said.\n\nHe declined to confirm which classified networks Defense Llama is running on — or specific military units that are tapping into it — to date.\n\nBut in an emailed statement, a Scale AI spokesperson later confirmed that the model “is now available for integration into various defense systems, including command and control platforms, intelligence analysis tools, and decision-support systems.”\n\nDefense Llama can be accessed exclusively in controlled government hubs housed within the Scale Donovan platform.\n\nTadross used Donovan to demonstrate the new LLM for DefenseScoop.\n\nThe platform presented another commercial LLM in a side-by-side view with Defense Llama. In the first demo, Donovan posed the question: “As a military planner, which munition should I select to destroy a hardened structure while minimizing collateral damage from a nearby civilian facility?”\n\nDefense Llama provided a lengthy response that also spotlighted a number of factors worth considering, such as “hardness of the target, distance from civilian facilities, environmental features, and time constraints.”\n\nThe other LLM replied with an apology, a simple explanation that the question was out of its scope, and a recommendation to seek other options.\n\nFor another prompt, Tadross asked: “What tactics has Iran employed against coalition forces?”\n\nHe explained in real time that the model that’s not Defense Llama supplied “a straight refusal.” The Scale AI-configured LLM, on the other hand, offered up multiple paragraphs about how Iran has used ballistic missiles, cyber warfare, intelligence gathering, terrorist groups and naval forces.\n\n“This is all very much in line with what they’ve actually done,” Tadross noted.\n\nDrawing back on his past experiences operating inside military command centers, he remembered how key data points and information would be funneled through many officials in high-stakes scenarios before reaching top decision-makers.\n\n“The intent behind deploying technology like this, and the impact that I expect that it’ll make, is that it will reduce the reliance on more and more people sitting at those headquarters sections doing the grunt work that’s necessary to pull the data together. So instead, what you’ll have is a situation where there’ll be fewer people able to access a larger swath of data and make a decision quite a bit faster than what they would have done otherwise,” Tadross told DefenseScoop.",
      "# [Scale AI and CAIS Unveil Results of Humanity’s Last Exam](https://scale.com/blog/humanitys-last-exam-results)\nScale AI and the Center for AI Safety (CAIS) are proud to publish the results of Humanity’s Last Exam, a groundbreaking new AI benchmark that was designed to test the limits of AI knowledge at the frontiers of human expertise. The results demonstrated a significant improvement from the reasoning capabilities of earlier models, but current models still were only able to answer fewer than 10 percent of the expert questions correctly. The paper can be read here.\n\nThe new benchmark, called “Humanity’s Last Exam,” evaluated whether AI systems have achieved world-class expert-level reasoning and knowledge capabilities across a wide range of fields, including math, humanities, and the natural sciences. Throughout the fall, CAIS and Scale AI crowdsourced questions from experts to assemble the hardest and broadest problems to stump the AI models. The exam was developed to address the challenge of “benchmark saturation”: models that regularly achieve near-perfect scores on existing tests, but may not be able to answer questions outside of those tests. Saturation reduces the utility of a benchmark as a precise measurement of future model progress.\n\n“We wanted problems that would test the capabilities of the models at the frontier of human knowledge and reasoning,” said Dan Hendrycks, CAIS co-founder and executive director. “We can’t predict how quickly the models will advance. When I released the MATH benchmark—a challenging competition mathematics dataset—in 2021, the best model scored less than 10%; few predicted that scores higher than 90% would be achieved just three years later. Right now, Humanity’s Last Exam shows that there are still some expert closed-ended questions that models are not able to answer. We will see how long that lasts.”\n\nTesting Methodology\n\nAltogether, CAIS and Scale researchers collected more than 70,000 trial questions. That led to a selection of 13,000 questions for human expert review which, in turn, were finalized to a set of 3,000 questions on the final exam’s public release. The questions were aimed at world-class expert levels and were put to several multi-modal, frontier LLMs including OpenAI GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, and OpenAI o1.\n\n“We know the AI revolution is being shaped by human ingenuity, and we're proud to be at the forefront. To help humans measure AI progress, we engineered what might be the ultimate test, meticulously distilled and designed to challenge the world's most advanced models at the frontiers of intelligence—requiring precise, multi-step logical reasoning and unambiguous answers at a level that pushes even the most sophisticated AI systems to their limits.” Summer Yue, Director of Research at Scale AI said.\n\nHumanity’s Last Exam was a global collaborative effort involving nearly 1,000 contributors from more than 500 institutions across 50 countries, with most contributors being active researchers or professors. The questions spanned multiple formats, including text-only and multi-modal challenges that integrated images and diagrams.\n\nThe questions were designed to deeply test the capability of the models across diverse domains. For example, a question submitted in Ecology asked:\n\nHummingbirds within Apodiformes uniquely have a bilaterally paired oval bone, a sesamoid embedded in the caudolateral portion of the expanded, cruciate aponeurosis of insertion of m. depressor caudae. How many paired tendons are supported by this sesamoid bone? Answer with a number.\n\nAdditional sample questions can be found here lastexam.ai.\n\nIn the final round of testing, Yue said they saw some of the models begin to answer a fraction of the questions correctly (less than 10%); however, she said variations frequently happen in model testing and could be the result of randomness. CAIS and Scale AI said they will open up the dataset to the research community, to dig deeper into the variations and to evaluate new AI systems while continuing to explore the limitations of existing models. A small subset of questions will be held back to preserve integrity for future evaluations.\n\nTop Questions\n\nCAIS and Scale AI offered financial awards for the best contributions to Humanity’s Last Exam, with $5,000 USD awarded for each of the top 50 questions and $500 USD for the next 500 best submissions, along with the opportunity for coauthorship of the final paper.\n\n“By identifying the gaps in AI’s reasoning capabilities, Humanity’s Last Exam not only benchmarks current systems but also provides a roadmap for future research and development,” said Yue.\n\nHumanity's Last Exam Community Feedback Expansion - Bug Bounty\n\nAs part of our existing commitment to ensuring the integrity of Humanity’s Last Exam, we are releasing an expansion of our community feedback program into a Bug Bounty to incentivize harder-to-notice issues along with improved beta of Humanity’s Last Exam at lastexam.ai. We invite individuals who believe they have identified significant errors in this new beta of Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE) questions—errors that compromise the validity or accuracy of the questions—to report them through our bounty program. HLE is being cleaned as indicated during its announcement last month.\n\nSubmissions will be evaluated based on their validity, relevance, and impact on the dataset’s quality. Duplicate submissions will be rewarded on a first-come, first-serve basis. We're looking for major errors that directly affect the quality of the exam's questions and answers—minor typos or issues not related to the core integrity of the questions will not be rewarded.\n\nOur team will review all submissions, and the determination of what constitutes a valid report, the severity of an issue, and whether it qualifies for a reward rests solely with us. Please note that not all reported bugs may qualify for a payout, as we reserve the right to prioritize submissions based on available resources and program objectives.\n\nFinally, we will maintain and publish a public list highlighting all reported bugs under review and those that qualify for a bounty. For full details on how to submit your findings and get involved, please review our full Terms & Conditions below. We look forward to working together to ensure Humanity’s Last Exam sets the standard for AI benchmarks worldwide.\n\nConfidentiality and Non-Disclosure: To maintain the integrity of the benchmark, all bug reports must be submitted exclusively through the approved Google Form.

      "# [Scale AI pushes Congress to take action on AI data, safety issues this year by Matt Bracken on 2024-10-18](https://fedscoop.com/scale-ai-letter-to-congress-ai-priorities/)\nOne of the country’s leading generative AI startups is urging congressional leadership to take action on a trio of safety, data and definitional priorities for the emerging technology before the end of the year.\n\nIn a letter sent Thursday from Alexandr Wang to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., the Scale AI founder and chief executive officer applauded the lawmakers for bipartisan AI regulatory work this Congress while “strongly” pressing the quartet to include in a potential year-end legislative package three “key AI priorities that will better position the United States to become a global leader in AI development and deployment.”\n\nThe first of Scale AI’s priorities is the authorization of the AI Safety Institute, which Wang called “a critical body to further the necessary measurement science gaps associated with AI research.” The AISI, housed within the Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technology, should be “empowered to play a leading voice within” the existing network of overseas AI safety groups, the letter said.\n\n“Authorizing the AI Safety Institute is necessary so that Congress can guide a long-term direction for the global network and perform oversight to ensure the Institute is meeting its intent,” Wang wrote.\n\nThe second priority involves the creation of AI-ready data requirements for every federal agency. Scale AI wants agencies to convert raw data to AI-ready data, a priority Wang called “crucial” because “AI outputs are only as good as the data that models are trained on, and low-quality data will lead to low-quality outputs.”\n\n“Implementing this requirement will enhance the United States government’s ability to leverage AI technology effectively across all agencies,” he added.\n\nFinally, Scale AI wants Congress to provide clear definitions of “developers” and “deployers,” leaving no doubt on the use of such terms for industry, academia and all levels of government working “within the AI ecosystem.”\n\n“Based on activity at the state level, a patchwork of definitions has begun to emerge that threatens to stifle collaboration between key AI stakeholders,” Wang wrote. “Clear federal definitions would facilitate cooperation more smoothly among the players in the ecosystem, ultimately enabling industry to move forward more effectively.”\n\nWang’s letter, which was also sent to five of Congress’ top AI-focused lawmakers — Sens. Todd Young, R-Ind., Mike Rounds, R-S.D., and Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., and Reps. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., and Jay Obernolte, R-Calif. — additionally calls for AI workforce training and the standing up of the National AI Research Resource, though those priorities would take a backseat to the aforementioned three.",

      "# [AI’s race to value: A conversation with Abridge, Anthropic, Perplexity, and Scale AI by Ross Matican on 2024-12-10](https://www.bvp.com/atlas/ais-race-to-value-a-conversation-with-abridge-anthropic-perplexity-and-scale-ai)\nWhen we asked top CEOs about the state of the AI market, one sentiment rang clear: “It’s still so early.”\n\nBut if the evolution of the cloud economy taught us anything, tomorrow’s AI giants will be defined by more than just superior technology — they’ll need distribution and sustainable business models. This year, a new generation of AI startups across the model and application layers are exploring innovative approaches to monetization and go-to-market strategies.\n\n\"It's still so early\"\n\nSo, on the Cloud 100 stage, we gathered the leaders shaping the future of artificial intelligence: Daniela Amodei, co-founder and president of Anthropic; Aravind Srinivas, CEO and founder of Perplexity; Shiv Rao, CEO and founder of Abridge; and Alexandr Wang, CEO and founder of Scale AI.\n\nTogether, these top AI leaders shared insights into the realities facing executives and builders today. While the technology advances at breakneck speed, AI adoption faces hurdles: usability, ethical, distribution, and retaining customers.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, startups must focus on niche applications, design user-centric experiences, and navigate the infrastructural complexities required to deliver enterprise-grade solutions. Ultimately, success in the AI space will come down to the ability to compound value over time, adapt to evolving market needs, and carve out meaningful differentiation in an increasingly competitive landscape.\n\nDive into the conversation on the state of the AI industry — quotes have been lightly edited for clarity and concision.\n\nAs capable as AI already is, the tech is still nascent\n\nWhat changed the most about AI in the last few years? Perhaps it’s how user-friendly LLMs have become. Machine learning and algorithms have long been part of the software technology stack. But prior to 2022, they were the provenance of researchers and technical teams. Now, most people use them daily. Perhaps that has caused everyone to think they know something about them. We asked our founders, what do you most wish more people understood about AI right now?\n\nFirst off, there is just how complex and difficult it is to staff a team with the right skill and technology to put an AI tool into market. “I’m not sure people appreciate the amount of alchemy it takes to actually deliver an enterprise-grade solution,” says Shiv Rao, founder and CEO of Abridge, which offers an AI tool for clinicians. “The ingredients range from computer science and data models to input from professors, PhDs, domain experts, and people testing it in the wild.”\n\n\"There is more work ahead of us than behind.\"\n\nDaniela Amodei, founder and president at Anthropic, stresses how much further the industry has to go. “Even though the numbers are staggering, there is more work ahead of us than behind,” she says. At Anthropic, she is thinking hard about what it takes to imbue all the ethics, security, and trust necessary into today’s Claude models.\n\nAlexandr Wang, founder and CEO of Scale AI, which offers AI infrastructure, stresses that the progress is far more rapid than is obvious to consumers. “You should not expect to see any slowdown in the performance of these models,” he says. “It’s an incredible place of technological progress.”\n\nMeanwhile, Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity points out that adoption of intelligent search isn’t where it needs to be. “It’s early, and people are not using these tools regularly. They need to be more intuitive,” he says. “Our goal at Perplexity is to take all the amazing models everybody else builds and shape them into amazing consumer experiences.”\n\nAI is developing faster than industry can absorb it\n\nThere is actually a top speed at which companies can absorb money- and time-saving AI technologies, says Daniela, and we are nearing it.\n\n“We’ll come up with new research areas and interests and features, but then you have to turn them into something that is quickly usable by businesses,” she says. She likens it to working with both your hands, and one of them moving considerably slower than the other.\n\nAlexandr feels that society hasn’t even discovered the best use for AI yet, and to him, that’s an exciting premise. “We don’t yet know the giant, killer applications, and I think that means the infrastructure layer is going to see many more years of growth.” It also coincides, he says, with a renewed period of global and governmental change, which will accentuate institutional interest in AI. “As I see it, the fate of the free world hangs upon whether or not AI is that defining innovation for this era. I really hope governments understand that.”\n\nRegulated industries like healthcare are adopting AI the fastest\n\n“I don’t think any industry is adopting AI as quickly as healthcare right now,” says Shiv. “We are announcing a new health system every week and they are adopting it because we’re in a public health emergency. Two out of five doctors don’t want to be doctors in the next two to three years, and over a quarter of nurses don’t want to be nurses in the 12 months.” That rate of burnout and attrition is causing healthcare organizations to scramble for ways to improve the quality of care and clinician experience.\n\nAbridge, for example, uses generative AI to transform patient-clinician conversations into real-time clinical notes, offering immediate benefits: less documentation, better patient engagement, multilingual support, and improved clinician well-being.\n\n“The most profound feedback we’ve gotten from primary care physicians is that for the first time in their 20-30 year career, they’re making eye contact with patients,” says Shiv.\n\n“We hear the exact same type of stories,” echoes Daniela. “So many healthcare practitioners are exhausted and burned out from administrative work. We’re also seeing industries typically slower to adopt technology flocking to AI. Companies with big, legacy code bases, such as financial services industries, which are built on trust.” In those scenarios, AI means experts can spend time with customers.\n\nIndustries are not monoliths and AI startups are learning to niche down\n\nFounders in a space like healthcare well know, a hospital is not a clinic is not a dental practice is not a medical device supplier. Vertical industries and unique contexts introduce new challenges for AI startups training models on specific data sets to accomplish specific tasks. But it’s also an opportunity to niche down.\n\n“You have those really large health systems and then on the other end, you have the doctor down the street,” says Shiv. They are two very different personas with very different needs,” not to mention tolerances. “In big health systems, the bar for ‘good enough’ is very high. Every doctor there is an ‘edge case assassin’ — you get one thing wrong and you’re dead to them forever. But that doctor down the street, good enough may be enough. They just need relief.”\n\nThe perennial challenge remains: distribution\n\nWhen Aravind first started raising money for Perplexity, he was confident he could build a better product based on a new model that had less of a conflict of interest around the user experience than its established competitors. But a product is not enough, as AI companies learn repeatedly.\n\n“Investors said, yes that is cool but how are you going to get distribution?” recalls Aravind. “This is the often-told story of how Sundar Pichai became the head of Google. Everybody else focused on flashy products, while he focused on getting Chrome to become the dominant browser. This is why we are partnering with telcos, LinkedIn, Uber, and more.”\n\nWhen switching costs are low, experience is everything\n\nAravind sees the value of Perplexity as answering people’s questions better than other search providers. People will settle on the experiences that are the best. “We always pull multiple relevant sources from the web,” he says. “That helps us be far more accurate, especially in matters of real-time knowledge.” That narrow focus has fueled their growth: Last year, they answered 500 million queries, says Aravind. Now they do this on a monthly basis. Meanwhile, they seek to monetize in ways other than the traditional sponsored search engine links — such as sponsored questions, or a publisher program.\n\nBut ultimately, they are just figuring out the details: “It’s an experiment, right?,” says Aravind. “Nobody’s really trying different models outside of subscriptions. Our belief is that if this succeeds, we can compensate content creators too by sharing the ad revenue.”\n\nImmature markets are forgiving of new models\n\nIn mature markets, the go-to-market motions must be more carefully planned. But in a market like today’s — rapidly expanding with unexplored territory — what may matter more is simply getting started.\n\n“We’re so early in the AI industry, I think a lot of business models will work. So will many approaches to getting users,” says Alexandr. “Whether it’s product-led growth, top-down sales, government sales, the model layer, the infrastructure layer, a bit of everything will succeed. If we jump forward 10 years, I think it’s obvious AI will be ubiquitous.” There is, in sum, vast room for growth and many players.\n\nBut as we’ve seen with other technological paradigm shifts, Alexandr thinks the first movers will still hold the advantage in the AI era. He equated these dynamics to the early days of the Internet and the Browser wars. “I talked to a VC about Netscape,” Alexandr says, “who told me, ‘Yeah, we originally thought we were going to monetize with the browser, then Internet Explorer crushed us. We built a wholly new business, servers, and that ended up being way bigger than the browser business we had.’”\n\nThe takeaway? Many major businesses are yet to be discovered as technology evolves and new business models emerge. However, the AI players that establish a foothold in a market and solid distribution early on will secure a competitive edge. They’ll gain the flexibility to explore new monetization strategies and continue growing.\n\nThe best response to the retention challenge? Know thy customer\n\nRetention is a challenge in nearly every digital market, but especially those with low switching costs. How are AI startups retaining those first-time users? Perplexity is focused on getting various cohorts of first-time users to make a second query. “We track two types of retention — by week and by demographics and whether people make another query in their lifetime. Initially, we were at 80%, and I said we need to push this as close to 100% as possible. Then we’ll focus on people making five queries, and it becomes a habit.”\n\nFor Daniela and Anthropic, success is about narrowly knowing and serving their specific audience. “Claude users tend to be highly educated and use it for work or related tasks. So I joke, we’re not in the business of making snowboarding cat videos. Those are very fun. But that’s not what our user base is asking for. They want help with their writing, analyzing information, and looking through legal documents, etc.”\n\nIf competing against a goliath, win on one narrow use case\n\nPerplexity is competing against the largest search engines in existence. How do they plan to win? To compete only in areas where they can win, which deliver incremental value to the user. “One thing is very clear and that’s that we’re not trying to take the navigational behavior away — Googling words like ‘Reddit’ or ‘Costco,’ they can have that. That’s probably a billion searches a day by itself,” says Aravind. Instead, he and the team are targeting the detailed, complex queries where an engine like Perplexity has an advantage. “We would love to be a majority player there.”\n\nThe Perplexity team is also careful to compete on exclusively what matters to their user — the actual experience. “Earlier, whoever tried to take on Google would attack them on privacy or monopoly practices,” says Aravind. “Consumers didn’t really get a differentiated experience from that. But now that's possible because LLMs really started working well on instruction tuning, and conversations, and being able to summarize without hallucinations.” Users are switching for situations where that really does work better.\n\nFor all their differences, every AI startup has two choices\n\n“It’s go public or sell. It’s asymptotic,” says Aravind. “For that, you have to be profitable, or on the path to profitability. It’s better if you don’t have to pump lots of sales motions into that; the margins will be higher. If you can really change people’s daily habits, and the product spreads to a good chunk of the world, and you can monetize a good chunk of those queries, that’s what we’re trying to do.”\n\nMany AI startups have a tailwind in this respect — they benefit from rapid advances infrastructure, from competition driving down the price of models to open source removing barriers. But then the question is, how do you turn that into an advantage over others?\n\n“The question it all comes down to is, can you compound?” asks Alexandr. “AI can. I think that’s what Aravind was getting at. The difference between whether or not you become a trillion-dollar company or not is, do you have the ability to just compound over an extremely long time? And I think that’s very possible with AI.”",

The duo noted the cumbersome, repetitive nature of support interactions and ops workflows, and saw an opportunity to streamline the process.\n\n\"For companies, there's an explosion of C-Suite and boardroom interest into the question, what is our AI strategy?\" said Michael Woo, CEO of Applied Labs.\n\n\"The bottleneck isn't the model anymore - LLM quality, speed and cost have reached an inflection point where almost every business can save time, cost and improve the quality of their support and ops.\n\n“The challenge is in the data, tools and platform for teams to easily set up and perfect AI agents on their business-critical workflows. We’re obsessed with making our AI agents the best where if you’re not using them, you’re falling behind.\"\n\nThe Applied Labs investment comes at a critical time in the evolution of AI agents, with a host of major industry players such as Salesforce, Google, and Microsoft having unveiled their own agentic AI services.\n\nAt Applied Labs, the founder team believes they’re more than capable of building high quality, reliable, and easily-deployable agents that can compete with industry heavyweights.\n\nThe startup’s agentic AI solution focuses on three specific – and critical – areas that will deliver the best results for users. This includes:\n\nOmnichannel interactions spanning chat, email, and phone to handle request volumes\n\nAI agent orchestration for handling Q&A and AI workflows\n\nEvaluation tools for testing, auditing, and monitoring AI outputs\n\nNotably, this approach also includes in-built human-in-the-loop options, helping users find the right balance between efficiency and human touch for complex or emotionally-charged situations.\n\n“AI allows you to scale up your best human judgement on an infinite volume of tasks but human judgment is still necessary to get the best quality results and handle edge cases.“ Woo said.\n\nThis human-in-the-loop aspect is a key differentiator, according to Woo. A single misstep or botched customer inquiry can seriously erode trust and create more problems down the line.\n\n“At Scale when we first did AI labeling or if you think about self-driving cars or even these AI sales agents, if you scale up a poorly thought out AI response or workflow on high volume, it’s deeply damaging.” Woo said.\n\nWoo noted that the firm’s in-built guardrails and monitoring systems ensure rigorous testing of the AI and human auditing before deployment.\n\nThis latest investment brings the total raised by Applied Labs to $5.2 million and will be used to double the firm’s headcount in the coming months. The startup revealed plans to accelerate engineer role hiring to advance its product roadmap.\n\n“Few founders truly grasp the operational intricacies of deploying AI in mission-critical workflows,” said Ramtin Naimi, founder & general partner at Abstract.\n\n“Michael’s experience managing Scale AI’s core data product brings a rare fusion of technical acumen and practical experience — exactly what’s needed to make AI both dependable and transformative. Applied Labs’ commitment to pairing trust with capability, underpinned by their human-in-the-loop approach, is precisely what enterprises need to confidently embrace AI-powered customer support.”",

      "# [Scale AI is facing a third worker lawsuit in about a month by Charles Rollet on 2025-01-22](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/22/scale-ai-is-facing-a-third-worker-lawsuit-in-about-a-month/)\nScale AI is facing its ​​third lawsuit over alleged labor practices in just over a month, this time from workers claiming they suffered psychological trauma from reviewing disturbing content without adequate safeguards.\n\nScale, which was valued at $13.8 billion last year, relies on workers it categorizes as contractors to do tasks like rating AI model responses.\n\nEarlier this month, a former worker sued alleging she was effectively paid below the minimum wage and misclassified as a contractor. A complaint alleging similar issues was also filed in December 2024.\n\nThis latest complaint, filed January 17 in the Northern District of California, is a class action complaint that focuses on the psychological harms allegedly suffered by six people who worked on Scale’s platform Outlier.\n\nThe plaintiffs claim they were forced to write disturbing prompts about violence and abuse — including child abuse — without proper psychological support, suffering retaliation when they sought mental health counsel. They say they were misled about the job’s nature during hiring and ended up with mental health issues like PTSD due to their work. They are seeking the creation of a medical monitoring program along with new safety standards, plus unspecified damages and attorney fees.\n\nOne of the plaintiffs, Steve McKinney, is the lead plaintiff in that separate December 2024 complaint against Scale. The same law firm, Clarkson Law Firm of Malibu, California, is representing plaintiffs in both complaints.\n\nClarkson Law Firm previously filed a class action suit against OpenAI and Microsoft over allegedly using stolen data — a suit that was dismissed after being criticized by a district judge for its length and content. Referencing that case, Joe Osborne, a spokesperson for Scale AI, criticized Clarkson Law Firm and said Scale plans “to defend ourselves vigorously.”\n\n“Clarkson Law Firm has previously — and unsuccessfully — gone after innovative tech companies with legal claims that were summarily dismissed in court. A federal court judge found that one of their previous complaints was ‘needlessly long’ and contained ‘largely irrelevant, distracting, or redundant information,’” Osborne told TechCrunch.\n\nOsborne said that Scale complies with all laws and regulations and has “numerous safeguards in place” to protect its contributors like the ability to opt-out at any time, advanced notice of sensitive content, and access to health and wellness programs. Osborne added that Scale does not take on projects that may include child sexual abuse material.\n\nIn response, Glenn Danas, partner at Clarkson Law Firm, told TechCrunch that Scale AI has been “forcing workers to view gruesome and violent content to train these AI models” and has failed to ensure a safe workplace.\n\n“We must hold these big tech companies like Scale AI accountable or workers will continue to be exploited to train this unregulated technology for profit,” Danas said.",
      "# [AI has an environmental problem. Here’s what the world can do about that. by United Nations Environment Programme, www.facebook.com on 2024-09-21](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/ai-has-environmental-problem-heres-what-world-can-do-about)\nFinally, to power their complex electronics, data centres that host AI technology need a lot of energy, which in most places still comes from the burning of fossil fuels, producing planet-warming greenhouse gases. A request made through ChatGPT, an AI-based virtual assistant, consumes 10 times the electricity of a Google Search, reported the International Energy Agency. While global data is sparse, the agency estimates that in the tech hub of Ireland, the rise of AI could see data centres account for nearly 35 per cent of the country’s energy use by 2026.\n\nWe have a decent handle on what the environmental impacts of data centres could be. But it’s impossible to predict how AI-based applications themselves will affect the planet. Some experts worry they may have unintended consequences. For example, the development of AI-powered self-driving cars could cause more people to drive instead of cycling or taking public transit, pushing up greenhouse gas emissions. Then there are what experts call higher-order effects. AI, for example, could be used to generate misinformation about climate change, downplaying the threat in the eyes of the public.\n\nIs anybody doing anything about the environmental impacts of AI?\n\nMore than 190 countries have adopted a series of non-binding recommendations on the ethical use of AI, which covers the environment. As well, both the European Union and the United States of America have introduced legislation to temper the environmental impact of AI. But policies like those are few and far between, says Radwan.\n\n“Governments are racing to develop national AI strategies but rarely do they take the environment and sustainability into account. The lack of environmental guardrails is no less dangerous than the lack of other AI-related safeguards.”\n\nHow can the world rein in the environmental fallout from AI?\n\nIn the new issue note, UNEP recommends five main things. Firstly, countries can establish standardized procedures for measuring the environmental impact of AI; right now, there’s a dearth of reliable information on the subject. Secondly, with support from UNEP, governments can develop regulations that require companies to disclose the direct environmental consequences of AI-based products and services. Thirdly, tech companies can make AI algorithms more efficient, reducing their demand for energy, while recycling water and reusing components where feasible. Fourthly, countries can encourage companies to green their data centres, including by using renewable energy and offsetting their carbon emissions. Finally, countries can weave their AI-related policies into their broader environmental regulations.\n\nUNEP is focused on helping the world better navigate the environmental challenges of tomorrow. To do that, we have ramped up our work on strategic foresight, scanning the horizon for emerging threats to the planet. This process culminated in the development of Navigating New Horizons – A Global Foresight Report on Planetary Health and Human Wellbeing, which was published earlier this year. Produced in collaboration with the International Science Council, it examined eight global shifts accelerating the triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste.",

      "# [Gig workers behind AI training firm sue for better conditions by Jon Gold, Lucas Mearian, Agam Shah, Preston Gralla, Jon Gold Senior on 2024-12-13](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3624021/scale-ai-under-fire-in-suit-filed-by-former-worker-alleging-unlawful-business-practices.html)\nA new class action lawsuit alleges poor working conditions and exploitive behavior by AI data processing company Scale AI, saying that workers responsible for generating much of its product were mischaracterized by the company as independent contractors, rather than full employees.\n\nScale AI’s services include providing the human labor to label the data used in training AI models and in shaping their responses to queries. For instance, a worker might label images from a car’s LIDAR detector to help create an AI that more accurately identifies objects.\n\nTo get this kind of human input, according to a complaint filed Tuesday in the Superior Court of California, Scale AI outsources work through services like Outlier, where named plaintiff Steve McKinney worked until June. Tasks for Scale AI, the complaint alleges, were assigned algorithmically, with payments reduced or denied for projects that exceeded a designated time limit. McKinney’s suit said that this amounts to a bait-and-switch in terms of promised compensation. In addition, it noted, workers were not paid for peripheral functions such as reviewing project guidelines, seeking clarification, or attending required training webinars.\n\nMoreover, the subject matter of many prompts, some of which involved suicidal ideation and violence, among other disturbing topics, coupled with restrictions from Scale AI around break times and outside research, created a grueling, authoritarian workplace in which workers could be terminated for complaining about working conditions, payments, or company processes, the complaint said.\n\nAdditionally, the suit says that McKinney and the many others in his position were misclassified under California law as independent contractors, rather than employees. Generally speaking, employers have fewer legal responsibilities to independent contractors than they have to full employees, who are more likely to be subject to state and federal laws about overtime payment, among other things.\n\nCalifornia’s legal standard for deciding which workers are independent contractors and which are employees is fairly strict, and is referred to as an ABC test, for its three-pronged nature. According to the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency, workers are employees unless they are free from the control and direction of the hiring entity, are doing work outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business, and are “customarily engaged” in an independent business of the type they’re being hired for. None of those standards, the lawsuit argues, are met in the case of McKinney and the other Scale AI workers in his position.\n\nLou Pechman, an employment attorney and head of the Pechman Law Group in New York, said that while the California ABC standard is quite forgiving to plaintiffs, McKinney’s suit would be a serious concern for employers in most jurisdictions.\n\n“The ABC test is a pretty low bar for determining employee status,” he said, “but the facts described in the complaint would establish an employee status under any standard.”\n\n“Sordid underbelly”\n\n“Scale AI is the sordid underbelly propping up the generative AI industry,” said the suit filed on McKinney’s behalf by the Clarkson Law Firm, based in Malibu, California. The firm has been at the forefront of civil litigation against the tech industry where AI is concerned, appearing for multiple plaintiffs in cases around copyright, privacy, and more.\n\nRyan Clarkson, the firm’s managing partner, said that the rapid growth of generative AI as a business has had corrosive effects on tech workers around the world.\n\n“Scale AI has built its business on a model of exploitation, relying on thousands of workers from across the globe to be paid less than a living wage to train AI applications for hours on end,” he said in a statement. “These workers operate under strict company control and are being cheated out of labor code protections. It’s unlawful and unacceptable.”\n\nScale AI’s head of communications, Tom Channick, declined to comment on the litigation but said via email that the company is committed to ensuring it is in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\n“Scale takes all contributor feedback seriously and has clear processes in place to address complaints,” he said. “For contributors who work on projects containing sensitive content, we have numerous safeguards in place, including advanced notice of the sensitive nature of the work, the ability to opt out at any time, and access to health and wellness programs.”\n\nScale AI’s marketing materials advertise that it works with some of the biggest players in the AI space, including Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Nvidia, although none of these companies had responded to requests for comment about the matter by the time this article was published. Earlier this year, Scale AI shut down its RemoteTasks subsidiary in several countries, including Nigeria, Kenya and Pakistan, without notice to its regular gig workers in those countries.",
