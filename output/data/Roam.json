That's the jg.\n\nJg is basically roam+. You do what roam does and then some extra. On one hand, you're probably going to be using heroes that have some of the most obnoxious power spikes and playmaking potential, on top of two buffs and a fast level 4. On the other hand, that means the team has *you* to look to to find the straws that will break the camel's back, and turn the tides of an even or even a losing game.\n\nThe stakes are higher, too. If the roam is sent to base multiple times or has some bad sets/kill secures, it's fine, they have utility that is nonreliant on maintaining a lead and can always play from behind, leaving the teammates to pull off the heavylifting of damage and objective secure. As jg, *you are the damage and objective secure*. If you go down, if you can't find a way to outplay your enemy or lose your lead, your entire team is probably doomed.\n\n## Comment ID lnugpd7 with +7 score by [(Maximum-Shrimping, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnugpd7/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nA good roam makes jungling easier. \nA good jungle makes winning the game easier. \n\nThey coexist.\n\n### Comment ID lnugukq with +1 score by [(NoobzProXD, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnugukq/) (in reply to ID lnugpd7):\nThis one seems to be the most reasonable, mlbb is a coop game after all\n\n#### Comment ID lnuhnos with +5 score by [(Maximum-Shrimping, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuhnos/) (in reply to ID lnugukq):\nI have 1 thing to add. \n\nPeople that think roamer is easy are also the same one that thinks that roamer should babysit gold lane.\n\n### Comment ID lnuipzs with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuipzs/) (in reply to ID lnugpd7):\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o180is0uwopd1.jpeg?width=449&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=279ade612825bc2c8c3b510b8ac522207084671b\n\n## Comment ID lnu8o1l with +11 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnu8o1l/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nYes it is.\n\nCome on all roles are important but the fact that a Jungler can guarantee you a lord and turtles is what it makes challenging and important \n\nAnd yes Roaming IS the easiest role for me\n\nYou can say roamers die protecting their teammates, but that is uncommon, mostly after a gank or set roamers survive, with low health but they do\n\nRoamer is least likely to be killed \n\nSurvival is the easy part\n\nBut to use their skills to set up cc and change the game is really difficult\n\n### Comment ID lnuaewf with +7 score by [(MiloCAD, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuaewf/) (in reply to ID lnu8o1l):\nYes, perhaps roamer is easier, but finding a decent roamer is like finding a needle in a haystack.\n\n#### Comment ID lnuakg1 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuakg1/) (in reply to ID lnuaewf):\nOf course\n\n### Comment ID lnuhwl3 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuhwl3/) (in reply to ID lnu8o1l):\nhaha, by reading this I know you don't roam that often.\n\n### Comment ID lnuynfk with +1 score by [(Rgamingchill, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuynfk/) (in reply to ID lnu8o1l):\nI'm both a good Jungler and a good roamer. I can assure you roaming is harder unless you are playing very high skill cap junglers such as Fanny. \n\nIf your teammate dies while they are behind you, it's your fault. If the mm hiding behind the tank is pierced through the tank, it's the tank's fault. If your Jungler is bonkers in the head you have to do his part of ganking too. \n\nOn the other side, junglers can hide under the excuse they were farming or that the ganking of a lane isn't I  their rotation. If the roamer babysits a lane, it's a Jungler's job to gank the other. More often than not, if both Jungler and Roamer are in a single lane, the enemy team will win one of the others. \n\nTL;DR Jungling is more lightheaded outside objectives.

Imo, yes for most matches in normal ranked games, junglers need to manage farming, ganking, dictation of teamfights and securing neutral objectives, all the while dealing with random variables like whether the mage and roam is on point and helping to defend against jungle invasions/providing vision etc, and also needing to read the flow of your laners, to provide extra assistance and attention if your laners are particularly weak to their counterparts either by drafting compatibility or skill gap.\n\nRoamers on the other hand, simply need to provide vision, stuns and/or support, defend against or support jungle invasions, and frontlining in teamfights but majority of roam players cant do that even decently, while always looking to blame someone for problems of their own making (usual targets for verbal abuse being MM and Jungler). Proper roamers also do not need to farm, so that takes a load of pressure off their shoulders (not considering assassins mainly as assassin roamers are pretty gimmicky, and usually work out lesser the higher the elo, not to mention that it usually attracts players with terrible roamer competencies even if they are good at the hero). Also roam hero mechanics are amongst the easiest while jungler heroes tend to be more dificult relatively on average, so its pretty difficult to argue in any dimension that roaming is harder than jungling in usual circumstances.\n\nHowever, thats a little different in the pro scene, because most pro players are near the very limits of their effective capacity and rarely makes any fundamental mistakes in their roles. Rather teamfights are the nexus event that determines whether the game is won or lost, and roamers have a outsized role when it comes to teamfight initialisation, frontlining or disrupting the enemy's flow by clouding their judgement and forcing them to use skills at the wrong time. Kills are also rarely secured 1v1 in that level due to the high competency of everyone on that level, which means any kill from another person at least involves the mage or jungler, but probably the roamer, so roamers play incredibly important roles in the pro scene, serving as the difference makers. That doesnt apply to most people on this subreddit however, even MI wouldnt be close to the pro scene standard.\n\n## Comment ID lnuj1m3 with +1 score by [(Present-Difficulty-6, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuj1m3/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nThere’s a reason why Roams are the usual captains/shotcaller of the team.\n\n### Comment ID lnv19pp with +1 score by [(Tenmashiki, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnv19pp/) (in reply to ID lnuj1m3):\nThey are the shotcallers because it is not as micro intensive, allowing them to focus their attention on the overall flow and macro and make decisions from there.\n\n#### Comment ID lnvbl3s with +1 score by [(Present-Difficulty-6, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnvbl3s/) (in reply to ID lnv19pp):\nExactly why I think Junglers are harder to play..

A good Jungler with a bad roamer can't win a game by themselves against half-decent players. I've seen that firsthand in my games, either me or a team mate was Jungling and the roamer was awful, or in the enemy team where they had a great jungler and a God awful roamer. The jungler has higher expectations on their shoulders, but they need a roamer to pull them off. You can steal infinitely many objectives if you are good with retri, a bad roamer will make all of that useless. \n\nFurthermore, if a Jungler is bad, what they fail to do falls on the roamer. If a jungler wastes Retribution, it's the roamer who is expected to delay or halt the enemy team from taking the objectives while the cooldown is on. A roamer can often salvage something from a Jungler's mistake, which isn't true the other way around. \n\nLet me put it this way. Roaming is easy to learn, hard to master, while Jungling is hard to learn, but easy to master. As such, In the middle Point of the learning curve, Roaming definitely feels(and is) harder. That is, of course, not the case if the roamer in question is not a setter tank.\n\n## Comment ID lnv0sdv with +1 score by [(TerracottaaBanana, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnv0sdv/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nNeither they both are equally hard the roamer have the utility to be useful in the game no matter what stage they are in and jungler have DPS  to be useful in the game no matter what stage but they gotta to see care of objectives while roamer take care of other imo they both basically support each other as a role (I play both roam and jungle) I always ask for my roam to babysit me or I babysit my jungler until 5 minute and feed him roamer and jungle are the same role with different objective if you really think about it too they both roam they both support teammate while jungle put Damage on the table, Tank put utility so they are equally hard but if I have to choose I would say roam because they can't solo carry like jungle\n\n## Comment ID lnv3cjw with +1 score by [(LandscapeFeisty951, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnv3cjw/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nAs a roamer I think jungler is harder.

So it seems easier to us, because we look at this (idiot on the enemy team) that we used to have to protect XD  and now he's just ready to be taken out",

I beat the game a while ago and enjoy just free roaming around the map with no objective, just wondering around, discovering things, places, people, random events. Sometimes hunting and fishing, etc... Is there any game out for the ps4 that is similar to this type of game play experience? Doesn't even need to be western themed.\n\n## Comment ID h6t4cm7 with +16 score by [(Queeflet, Reddit, 2021-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/oszpl5/any_game_similar_to_rdr2_single_player_free_roam/h6t4cm7/) (in reply to ID oszpl5):\nNo other game does this as well as rdr2, I’ve played almost all of the big popular open world games on PS4 and all of them feel dead and sterile compared.\n\n### Comment ID h6x5cgf with +3 score by [(Ace_OPB, Reddit, 2021-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/oszpl5/any_game_similar_to_rdr2_single_player_free_roam/h6x5cgf/) (in reply to ID h6t4cm7):\nAgreed.

I haven't found anything quite as good as RDR2 for immersive free roaming. Titles I have enjoyed in no particular order are:\n\nWitcher 3: a little less focused on interactive free roam world but definitely lots to explore.\n\nGhost of Tsushima: again less interactive free roam but a fantastic experience (I actually preferred it over RDR2).\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn: definitely a fun game to go exploring in. I loved this despite it being a setting I traditionally don't enjoy.\n\nFar Cry 5: first person shooter with an interesting world to explore. It has many flaws, imo, but can be fun to wander about. The fishing is, imo, better than RDR2.\n\nGhost Recon Wildlands: suggesting this over the newer Breakpoint as it has a better world with the possibility of creating more intense situations.\n\nWatch Dogs 2: all three games are on ps4 but 2 in my opinion has the best map for exploration and the most potential to create interesting situations.\n\n## Comment ID h6s73ef with +12 score by [(DarkIxis, Reddit, 2021-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/oszpl5/any_game_similar_to_rdr2_single_player_free_roam/h6s73ef/) (in reply to ID oszpl5):\nDays Gone is the sandbox I'm trudging through, good mechanics, decent story, and lots of exploring.

The higher the Elo the harder it is for a mid roam to work.\n\nYet in Wildrift, it works every time. Roaming works because people lack the basic fundamentals of map awareness. Not every champion in mid can roam. If side lanes can react to roams and their mid didn't move mid that means they won the trade super hard. \n\nObviously to climb you have to adapt. So I find myself roaming even though I know it's the wrong decision. I do the same on PC when I'm playing in lower Elo.

Sometimes, the Mid-Laner has no choice but to let the invade happen, or maybe they're just dumb and don't understand the matchup. Wild Rift is very young, so most people don't have every bit of knowledge unlocked.\n\nNow, don't argue that you've played LoL PC before, I did too, but there are several nuances that are different in this and that. We have no starter items, no potions, but we have honeyfruit in the lane, the lane is shorter, etc. The macro concepts are similar, but it's still a different experience than in PC.\n\nIs this an excuse for the people who don't know Macro? No, I've beaten challengers by applying Macro several times before, and when I'm negligent about macro and the enemy team knows how to, I will lose even to Emerald players. But we haven't perfected Wild Rift the same way that we've perfected the art of PC, it may take a few more years before we see WR Challengers have the same skill as PC Challengers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THIS IS WHERE THE ACTUAL EXPLANATION BEGINS**\n\n \n\nThere are several reasons why Mid-Lane just can't come over to help you, but the two I want to talk about is Priority/Lane State, and Matchup.\n\nPriority and Lane State - Picture this, you're a ranged Mid-Laner vs an assassin, who do you think gets priority in this lane? 9 times out of 10, you should have total control of the wave if you're playing it properly. Every time he steps up or goes for CS, he should lose his HP for being so disrespectful. In this lane, you have priority, and the lane state should be pushing into him, now let's transition to the next concept.\n\nMatchup - Picture this, you're a Lee Sin vs. Evelynn, and your Mid-Laner is Orianna vs Akali. No one is level 5 yet. Now, Orianna has Akali pinned down under tower, she's shutting down any attempts she makes and she's forced to be stuck under tower until 5. \n\nBut let's reverse the roles for a moment. You're now Evelynn, your Akali is stuck under tower, she has a big cannon wave to collect, and you're here dueling LEE SIN of all people for scuttle. You see Orianna coming over to help Lee beat you up until you see grey. You should've conceded earlier, but you need to leave NOW. You don't. You die, and there's nothing Akali could've done for you there. You need to pay attention to the matchup, you shouldn't even show your face to Lee Sin at all, and Orianna is a ranged champion vs Akali in early game, you shouldn't expect anything to happen cause she can't do anything. Just because your Mid-Laner didn't come to help you, doesn't mean she's stupid, the circumstances just didn't allow her to do anything about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow all of those things I told you about? Don't forget them, they're important, but your Mid-Laner just wasn't paying attention to the map at all LMAO.\n\n## Comment ID hr12ii9 with +23 score by [(RefanRes, Reddit, 2022-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr12ii9/) (in reply to ID rur90t):\nSome champs in mid arent that good at roaming.

Roaming is matchup reliant. There is absolutely no point in let's say a Ziggs following an Ahri in to the river. Some champs are build to roam, and some aren't. It's up to the rest of the team to identify that and acknowledge that if enemy mid is off the map then play safer, because your mid doesn't have as much agency. \n\nNot that a ziggs should never roam, but by design, the champion is better at sieging than roaming for kills. Othe thing to consider is 2v2 matchup. If you're expecting your mid to rotate, when you're Evelyn and Lee Sin and for example a zed rotate and you're expecting your Kayle mid to come help. Yes people troll when not roaming when they should, but also people troll just as much taking skirmishes when they have no idea how the 2v2 matchup *should* work. - then blame mid for not rotating.\n\n### Comment ID hr5eoyp with +1 score by [(BlitzBlotz, Reddit, 2022-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr5eoyp/) (in reply to ID hr1z8g7):\n>There is absolutely no point in let's say a Ziggs following an Ahri in to the river.\n\nDepending on the situation you should clear the wave which shouldnt take more than 2/3 sec for ziggs and than follow ahri through your jungle, not river to the lane she tries to gank so you can ult into the gank if necessary.\n\nI see so many Ziggs players not utilizing his almost global presence properly.\n\n#### Comment ID hr77n61 with +1 score by [(Awwbelt, Reddit, 2022-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr77n61/) (in reply to ID hr5eoyp):\nAgree maybe walk to *your red buff* and use Ur ult as support damage. Then more than likely return to mid and attempt to take plates and deny waves. You will more than likely lose a 3v3 as ziggs - because he's suited to siege. Not roam. Nothing you have said counters my point, and in fact you agree ziggs shouldn't walk down river with Ahri. \n\nThat alone gives Ahri time to gank while I'm still walking through my jungle. Ziggs isn't a roamer. Ori isnt a roamer. Some champs want to deny waves instead. If it's ziggs Vs kat, and kat keeps roaming bot for double kills - that's not mid diff, that's bot diff.\n\n## Comment ID hr24e26 with +8 score by [(Sgrinfio, Reddit, 2022-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr24e26/) (in reply to ID rur90t):\nI find the opposite quite common lol.

TF however can roam even though he's not a strong early game champ because he can teleport. Galio is also a roaming mid because he's pretty good early and has teleport. Assassins should try to win lane and roam whenever possible because they have mobility to move quickly to other lanes or escape from enemy jungler when caught, need kills to snowball, and are usually quite strong in the early game.\n\nMy experience being a midlane Orianna main for the last two seasons is that when I roam too much, my gold advantage just disappears even though my jungler helped me get first blood. So when I face a relatively equal matchup, I rarely roam unless a fight around neutral objectives is happening, or I am very certain that I can get a kill or help my teammates get a kill when roaming (enemy laners are very low on hp, skills on cooldown, overpush, enemy jungler is in the opposite lane, laners/jungler are ready to skirmish, etc.)\n\n## Comment ID hr208a3 with +2 score by [(BLAST_V, Reddit, 2022-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr208a3/) (in reply to ID rur90t):\nIts mostly lane priority\n\n## Comment ID hr1818o with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr1818o/) (in reply to ID rur90t):\nI only roam after t1 mid is down.

People doesnt figured it out that 2 waves worth more than one kill, its just doesnt show in the scoreboard.\n\n### Comment ID hr1oncr with +3 score by [(Vrast, Reddit, 2022-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr1oncr/) (in reply to ID hr1818o):\n???Most Mid lane champs take towers slow AF, Tf isn't even designed to win his lane, most games Bot and top towers go down first that means you're useless I hope you're never in my games\n\n\n\n### Comment ID hr1qrld with +1 score by [(ItsLoudB, Reddit, 2022-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr1qrld/) (in reply to ID hr1818o):\nThat kata getting a double kill because you didn’t follow up is way worse than losing one plate.

2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/13u877w/what_are_the_easiest_champions_to_roam/)\nLately i was playing a lot of Pantheon since i'm maining him, and i went up from Bronze IV to Silver I in like a few days just playing him, and now i know why, with his ult i can roam the map very easily, if i'm winning mid i can also gank bot or top using it and get free kills, If i'm losing, i can help botlane and get a kill or assist from time to time and get back in the game.\n\nI could pretty much carry the majority of games doing just that, but i was afraid i was gonna be useless whenever Pantheon was banned so i tried playing other champions like Jax and... yup, i couldn't perform nearly as well, so now i'm looking for champions that can easily roam the map for Top or Mid, so i could use a similar strategy, the ones i know from the top of my head are:\n\n* Pantheon: because of his ultimate\n* Shen: because of his ultimate as well\n* Quinn: because of her movespeed\n* Aurelion Sol: not as well as the others, but if you get a lot of stacks you can roam bot with your W\n\nAre there any other champions that are extremely easy to roam/gank other lanes that

They had maybe 3 seconds to react to this and considering this is plat they don't even look at the minimap. \n\nThat being said, I do NOT recommend TF to anyone below gold.

      "# Post ID 1amz7sx: Recommendations for games like Genshin. (Single player; free roam; exploration with puzzles) with +5 score by [(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/)\nHi,\n\nDo you have any recommendations for games like Genshin Impact. I mean: single player mainly; free roaming open-world and exploration with puzzles.\n\nFrom what I know:\n\n\"Zelda Breath of the Wild\" and \"Tears of Kingdom\"\n\nImmortal Fenyx Rising\n\nWuthering Waves (not yet released but I still count it)\n\n* What I do **NOT** look for:\n\nGames mainly focused on multiplayer (example: Tower of Fantasy) (I have a bad connection, so my ping is quite bad. It's still okay when Internet is only a bit required like Genshin, but once other players are involved, I often have a lag of a few seconds)\n\nNon free-roaming games (example: Honkai Star Rail) (The puzzles often make me feel like I found a rubik's cube on the side of the road instead of the puzzle being hidden and part of the world. What I am looking for is to explore, find secrets and be rewarded for solving them; all that in a fluid way, instead of the puzzle interrupting my freedom of movement).\n\n* What make no difference for me:\n\nCombat: Combats can be action or turned based\n\nClimbing: There can be no climbing. It can even be no jumping. As long as the environment allow falling from edges to find secret (think Dark Souls. No real jumping, but you can find a lot of secrets anyway\n\nDoes anyone know of games like that?\n\nEdit: For more precision: What I am looking for is environmental puzzle; puzzle where you still control your character to solve the puzzle. Not puzzle that feels more like a minigame totally separated from the main gameplay.\n\nAnd the feeling I am looking for is: you explore the world, find a puzzle out in the wild. You try to solve it; if you can't solve it, no problem, you can just return to it later. The other puzzles aren't locked because you didn't complete the previous ones; while at the same time you find puzzles through exploring, it's not a serie of room with puzzle in each of them.\n\n## Comment ID kpphbg1 with +8 score by [(Due-Distribution-463, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpphbg1/) (in reply to ID 1amz7sx):\nFallout 4 and Skyrim are the best open world games although both are graphically out of date.

Wow, I never thought about it, but *yeah*, the Tallnecks ARE puzzles, where you have to observe the terrain and the machines guarding it, then approach carefully. \n\nMany fights are also puzzles, as (unless you play on the lightest difficulty) it's best to start stealthy and go noisy only when you're not going to get attacked from four different directions. Stealth games are IMHO partly puzzle games where you're trying to solve how to move from point A to point B with a minimum of fuss. \n\nThe sequel has a LOT more puzzles, some of which I remember very fondly; climbing up a pair of overgrown skyscrapers in San Francisco or delving a ruin in the remains of Las Vegas.\n\n#### Comment ID kptrxtg with +1 score by [(Toutanus, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kptrxtg/) (in reply to ID kpphrd1):\nForbiden West has more puzzles\n\n## Comment ID kppgsqd with +3 score by [(Mar_ZP, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kppgsqd/) (in reply to ID 1amz7sx):\nI'm not sure it matches your description but I'll throw it anyways...

Oblivion and Morrowind, too.  Elex is essentially a double-A version of this, if you're really desperate. \n\n\nA bunch of open world jrpgs would match your criteria, too. Try xenoblade, modern final fantasy, etc. \n\n\nDark souls is even heavier on combat and lighter on puzzles than skyrim, but some are free roam. Elden ring is similar, but with much more free roam than dark souls. \n\n\nFallout and starfield could be stretched to meet your criteria. Puzzles are almost non existent tho. \n\n\nAt this point, you're running out of games. Nier and Nier Automata are less free roam than you'd like, and have no focus on puzzles.\n\n### Comment ID kpvoi0q with +3 score by [(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpvoi0q/) (in reply to ID kpqiicx):\nI am looking for these puzzles. I am looking for the type of games where you explore, then suddenly, a wild puzzle appears. If you can't solve it, you just return to it later. But the puzzle is environmental, you are still in controls of your characters. A lot of JRPG have the \"rubik's sube\" feeling: you no longer control you character, and instead control the puzzle. It's often because map movement/interaction is limited.\n\nOne of the rare exception for JRPG, is Golden Sun.

Great memories of sword only and that one bow challenge in the inazuma quest where java spent days to get around it. \n\nOfc without an audience you don't have that much of an incentive to not cheat if you're stuck but you can give you hard penalties, e.g. 1 cheat costs a 10pull on the standard banner or something like that. \n\nBut that's just if you're reeeeaaally into a challenge, otherwise it'll likely burn you out\n\n### Comment ID kpvi8lg with +2 score by [(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpvi8lg/) (in reply to ID kpr0ifs):\nI am more looking at something casual.

It's kinda free roaming but not a true open world, to open some area you have to play the story first just like genshin\n\n\nThe puzzle, well.. the puzzle is tied to the exploration. Example: to open a door to the next room, you have to climb here, climb there activate this and that, like prince of persia. The puzzle is basically mandatory, so maybe you won't like that.\n\n### Comment ID kpr6lgs with +2 score by [(AMadTeaParty81, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpr6lgs/) (in reply to ID kpr36ua):\nDarksiders 2 was a banger.\n\n### Comment ID kpvihoq with +1 score by [(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpvihoq/) (in reply to ID kpr36ua):\nIt's more of a traditional Zelda/metroidvania.

It's not totally open world but there are several expansive areas that you can go to find stars. There are little guys you need to fight off, but no character building. There are a ton of puzzles that you can play and ditch if you want to work on other puzzles (all give you stars so that you can fight the boss and move to the next area).

You appreciate the wildlife, the trees, the weather, the landscape and the music a lot more when you're not blazing past it at 100mph. \n\nBut that's the downside: most game companies are about providing intense action at all times. Very few games want to give the player a slow moment because those are moments that a player is likely to stop playing in. Even comparing RDR1 to RDR2 illustrates this as RDR1, fantastic as it is, plays more like a _video game_ than a _simulation_, which is the core difference in my eyes\n\n### Comment ID gsbh2i9 with +9 score by [(LexB777, Reddit, 2021-03-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbh2i9/) (in reply to ID gsb7qjk):\nReally interesting point.

I'm the kind of player that buys about 1 or 2 games per year.\n\nNow that I'm in the last Chapter of the whole game, I wish I had taken it even slower (even though I have 180 hours logged into the first save, not sure if that's normal but it feels like a lot).

I’m a support on a hs league of legends team and I do consider myself a good support but as I went from Top laner to a Support main, there are a lot of things that seem very different to me. For example, roaming.\n\nMy ADC is very talented and no doubt he can freeze the minion wave if need be, but he doesn’t make lane priority, a *priority*. We’ve won many matchups with this dynamic, but when I watch tutorials over how to be a better support, roaming when you have lane priority is a great element. I play Lulu most often, Taric as an alternative matchup, and Yuumi as a last resort. Obviously, roaming with Yuumi may be a little risky, but I’ve heard that roaming with Lulu is encouraged. I just never know when I should!\n\nHelping out in mid lane is also encouraged, but that goes hand in hand with roaming. I just never know when! I’d love to be a little independent and help out the jungle and mid lander when I can, but I just feel to unsure to leave my ADC’s side. What can I do differently?\n\nI’d like to also mention that when I say my ADC is talented, he is *talented* If I help boost with with my W, he’s chasing down a double kill like a torpedo. Usually when the lane is clear again, he Backs, so I see how that would be a good opportunity, but I’ve been told by my team that it’s best I back with him. Tips?\n\nTL;DR: I want to roam the jungle and ward or roam to mid lane and help there but I feel too unsure as to when I should roam that I end up just sticking by my ADC’s side the whole landing phase.\n\n## Comment ID is5tfcn with +83 score by [(Dspawn2, Reddit, 2022-10-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/supportlol/comments/y301mb/when_do_i_roam/is5tfcn/) (in reply to ID y301mb):\nI can't offer much advice but I do wanna say how lucky you are to be on a high school LOL team... that was like a pipe dream for me when I was in high school it's cool to see that professional gaming is taking off in this regard.\n\n### Comment ID is68g6q with +22 score by [(themooseyoufear, Reddit, 2022-10-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/supportlol/comments/y301mb/when_do_i_roam/is68g6q/) (in reply to ID is5tfcn):\nThank you!

Me for instance, I know a bit of theory, but since I don't really play ranked I don't put in the effort to be able to learn to do it effectively in game.\n\n\\- First thing to understand is wave management. You need to be able to predict where the wave is gonna be in the near future whenever you think of roaming. Simple example, you shouldn't roam and leave your ADC alone when the enemy is currently freezing the wave near their tower. You should help breaking that freeze. Another example is when you and your ADC are backing, if you notice a slow push towards your tower then it's a good moment to go elsewhere after your back since it will not really put your ADC in a bad situation.\n\n\\- Second thing is what champions is in botlane. If your ADC has a Sivir, an Ezreal or a Tristana, it is much more safe to roam than if it's a Varus, Ashe or Jinx. Same with the enemy ADC, if they have Ashe or Varus for instance, they could catch your ADC from afar very easily, and get a kill with the cc-chain from their support. Finally, you have the enemy support pick, the most important I would say. A Leona is ultra dangerous for a lone ADC, as opposed to a Yuumi or a Braum (this is a scenario where the wave is not frozen near the enemy turret obviously, as the Braum could easily deny your ADC minions). Champions like Xerath or Lux can be super annoying as well, since they can free poke your ADC on cooldown without any threat from you, even under tower. You also have to analyze the roaming potential of the enemy support. Does he have mobi boots? Do you? Could he catch up to you fast for a counter gank or a counter invade? Is it a Pantheon that can come with his ult super fast? Is it a Bard that could arrive very fast, with a friend of his thanks to his tunnel? Try to see who has the \"roaming advantage\" in order to decide if you can/should roam at any moment. Also, if the enemy has picks like Twisted Fate, Karthus, Gangplank, Pantheon... Remember that they can all help from far away, and some of them can easily cut you in your roam if they see you with a ward a bit too deep.\n\n\\- Last thing imo is the state of the lane. Are you stomping the enemy? Are you getting stomped? Roaming when you're behind can be very hard for your ADC. If he's fed enough to be able to stand his ground in a 1v2, then you can roam much more. What I like to do sometimes when we're ahead is go in a botlane bush that I know is not warded, then hexflash towards the bush behind me, and go to the river through fog of war. This way, the enemy thinks you'll be in the bush all this time trying to cheese something. This is only doable with an advantage though, because it leaves your ADC with a pushed lane 1v2.\n\nThat's about it for my advice. Disclaimer though, I am not a master/challenger pro support. I am currently a low gold that barely plays ranked (I think I have like \\~35 ranked for this season). I think I could get mid-plat if I were to tryhard and climb, but probably not much more. I love the theory, but I'm not so good at practice. So if a challenger tells you something that is the opposite of what I said, you should listen to him haha.\n\nIf you have some questions about all this, don't hesitate! I like to brainstorm :)\n\n### Comment ID is6851h with +4 score by [(themooseyoufear, Reddit, 2022-10-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/supportlol/comments/y301mb/when_do_i_roam/is6851h/) (in reply to ID is5yx8z):\nThank you!

It makes a lot of sens.\n\nUltimately, I feel like there's no strategy set in stone when deciding if you should roam more when behind or when ahead. Because it really depends in the match-up as well imo.\n\nFor instance, if you have Braum vs an enchanter and you're ahead, you might want to roam more to help the map while your ADC can still get minions. But if you're behind in this match-up, you roaming makes farming for your ADC much harder imo.\n\nI may be wrong though, what do you think?\n\n## Comment ID is60onw with +4 score by [(FellowCookieLover, Reddit, 2022-10-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/supportlol/comments/y301mb/when_do_i_roam/is60onw/) (in reply to ID y301mb):\n\" I should roam that I end up just sticking by my ADC’s side the whole landing phase\"\n\nUsually, you want to push a wave under tower, then you have 3 possible scenarios, when your adc takes a plate, and the enemy botlane recalled.\n\na) You don't know where the enemy jungler is: you stay! The adc is NOT grieving by taking a plate that takes 6 secs, and delays his back by 15 sces.

If you're full health and 50% mana, your adc recalled and you see how your jg is about to be collapsed on between enemy jg and mid, that may be a good roam to take.  \n\n\n\\-sincerely, a jungle main.\n\n### Comment ID is67my7 with +1 score by [(themooseyoufear, Reddit, 2022-10-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/supportlol/comments/y301mb/when_do_i_roam/is67my7/) (in reply to ID is61f4q):\nThank you!

At first, you may only see such a chance once every few matches, but as you get the hang of it you will slowly become a threat the enemy has to take into consideration before making big plays.\n\n## Comment ID is6i1fv with +3 score by [(sadlife00000, Reddit, 2022-10-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/supportlol/comments/y301mb/when_do_i_roam/is6i1fv/) (in reply to ID y301mb):\nWhen your enemy is forced to back (died, or too chunked) you can match their back, and instantly run to a solo lane.\n\nMeanwhile ur adc pushes the wave, and have a free time until they come back, than she backs, and walks back to lane. (lets hope she doesn't die 1v1 to a gank, or gets cheesed by a fake back by the enemy) \n\nThe free time between the enemy backing and ur adc getting back to lane is probably the most simple and safest roam timing.\n\nIt is important that you need to be decisive when roaming. Walk straight to a sololane, engage, look for a 2v1 (or 3v1 with jungler) and the moment it doesn't work out, just head back to bot\n\n\n\nObviously there are other timings to roam, most notably when ur adc questionmark pings you 2 or more times in quick succession, it is perfect to leave bot and go roaming for an indefinite time. Timings like this give you opportunity to sit in mid/top bush for a good 30 seconds hoping for a play.\n\n## Comment ID is5wtws with +2 score by [(ScottMcPot, Reddit, 2022-10-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/supportlol/comments/y301mb/when_do_i_roam/is5wtws/) (in reply to ID y301mb):\nIf you're healthy roam before you back with the adc.

For instance, when we know they’ve backed and we’re going to bounce the wave, I look at minimap to see if there’s anything interesting. If I see mid is slightly pushed to either side, it tells me either wave is bouncing, or it’s a freeze. I then look with my camera to see if there’s potential. If there’s no potential, I don’t even bother. I will also look top in some cases. The other thing I do is walk through jg to lane. The time you lose going through jg isn’t that much and you have the option to gank mid. If your ADC is really good at freezing, since it’s coordinated play, you could pick something like thresh and just roam with your jg taking objectives and getting kills. There are times where if I’m super behind in lane but there’s another close, volatile matchup that I can impact positively, I’m leaving to go there. Same goes for I’m I have my ADC super far ahead and I can leverage my lead onto another lane. \n\nI will say, having played enchanters, I very much prefer roaming with tank/engage such as naut/thresh/Leo.\n\n## Comment ID is77o9g with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-10-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/supportlol/comments/y301mb/when_do_i_roam/is77o9g/) (in reply to ID y301mb):\nAm I useful in lane, and can my adc be easily killed 2v1.  \nY.

Will you gain more by roaming than by staying bot? A perk of roaming if your lane partner gets solo xp and you potentially put another enemy laner behind.

If he bases and you're still on decent health and mana, you got around 30 seconds to make a play happen mid lane without hurting your ADC.\n\nAnother time you should both roam is when the wave is in tower and enemies aren't bot lane. The ADC can base or follow you on a roam without losing anything during this timing, but you've got a free roam opportunity here no matter what.\n\nLastly, whenever something is going on in the river near bot lane or in your team's bot side jungle, you should roam to it. You can roam if it's in the enemy team's jungle, but you don't want to go all in and get collapsed on by multiple opponents. Play it safe and careful when in enemy territory, only taking the engage if you can look at the map and confirm the enemy mid laner's location. And a caveat to roaming in your bot side jungle is that, if you can see your jungler is probably going to die and you're probably not going to do anything with moving except waste your time and risk dying yourself, stay bot. Move your camera at it and look for a few things:\n\nIs your jungler below half health, while at least one enemy is above? If so, the roam isn't worth it.\n\nAre you and your jungler together still outnumbered if nobody else moves? If so, the roam isn't worth it.\n\nAre you leaving your ADC in a dangerous position? IE, he's in lane alone pushed to enemy tower against 2 people? If so, at least ping him to back off so that he has no excuse if he dies while you're gone. I often die because I had poor enough nap awareness to not notice my support was roaming, so pinging me back if I'm in a dangerous spot and you want to roam at least leaves me no excuse for it.\n\n## Comment ID is9e5z0 with +1 score by [(BloodlessReshi, Reddit, 2022-10-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/supportlol/comments/y301mb/when_do_i_roam/is9e5z0/) (in reply to ID y301mb):\nFinding windows of opportunity to roam is directly related to game state, for example, you and your ADC get a double kill bot and you know the enemy jungler is topside and midlaner is in mid? let your ADC get solo plates and recall before them, this will give you a brief window of time that you can use to help shove mid or drop a few deep wards with your jungler.\n\nTaric and Lulu can certainly roam, tho tehy are not the greatest at it, they rely heavily on what your teammates are playing, for example if you have a Sylas mid then a Taric roam is great, since you can link with W, then let sylas use the E dash to set up your stun and follow with their own stun, also if coordinated properly, you can roam mid with your ADC following you (im still talking about taric here), and force a dive with your ult in the mid tower getting some plates and pressure.\n\nRoaming in organized play is very different than roaming in soloQ thats for sure, in organized play your roams sometimes are just to deny the enemy from gaining pressure (depends on lane prio and all that stuff) on the map, while in soloQ roams tend to be to create advantages.\n\nSo, things to look at when trying to roam, wave state of lanes, jungler position (both ally and enemie if possible), goal of the roam (wether its stopping the enemy, making a play, or setting vision).\n\nAnd last but not least, depending on what the enemy lane is playing, you may be able to roam more often than you think, but that doesnt mean you should, every time you gank mid or top you are stealing exp from your solo laner, so unless your roam is successful, you could be putting your ally at a disadvantage in the long term.\n\n## Comment ID is9u5kl with +1 score by [(SneaKyHooks, Reddit, 2022-10-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/supportlol/comments/y301mb/when_do_i_roam/is9u5kl/) (in reply to ID y301mb):\nReal answer: when the opportunity is right and you either have nothing to lose from it, or the upside is huge.\n\nWhat this means:\n\n\\-You have to do it when it's safe for you and your ADC - in terms of neithe of you dying while one is alone and while you go up river or wtv, and when your lane is pushed, they are freezing, the lane is slow, no one is fighting, they have no hard engage, etc...\n\n\\-When you come from base is a pretty good time usually - one of the best tips I learned is to go back to bot throw the middle of the jungle between mid and bot - you'll basically be half way from either of those lanes and if mid is gankable then it's free, if it isn't you simply took a longer way bot that delayed you only about 5 seconds.\n\n\\-Check to see if your presence there you'll have bigger upside than just a kill, for example take herald/drake/turret after the fight (even if you don't kill anyone but they all runaway low, allowing you to take the objectives).\n\n\\-Sometimes you see people going back to base when they just came from there, which would be a good time to roam - let's say you based bought an item, got to bot, pick a fight but everyone stays low, and you stay half hp, and they back. Your first instinct might be to go back to base and purchase another ward or a very small item. Don't. Push the lane (if it isn't already) and go straight to mid to gank, or if it isn't gankable at that moment, roam aroun the enemy jungle to ward and after that mid might be worth a gank now. If it's still not, at least you got more vision and now can head back bot safely.\n\n## Comment ID ise7x94 with +1 score by [(Conman2205, Reddit, 2022-10-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/supportlol/comments/y301mb/when_do_i_roam/ise7x94/) (in reply to ID y301mb):\nAfter you have crashed a big wave into enemy tower, if your ADC needs to back and you don’t, if you have successfully frozen the wave on your side. \n\nFor the last one, don’t roam though if you assess that the enemy bot has very high tower dive threat (think where jg is and what champs they are playing)\n\nYou can roam immediately after backing if you see that by auto pathing bot lane there’s nothing you would be able to do",

Usually wave state, the mobility of your champion, matchup, your jungler’s location and the enemy jungler’s location.\n\nI tend to go for the plates that will net me the most safe amount of gold, which is usually staying in lane and getting plays and cs.\n\nHowever, I play top and a bad roam can doom your lane. And since the lane is long your wave state is going to be more important than mid.\n\nI’m not sure your elo, but you might be best securing plates and gold until you get to higher elo.\n\nMost roams by lower elo players are frequent and are not very gold efficient.\n\nWhen I play Normal games and go mid or top against a gold or lower player almost all their roams (and they roam a lot) lose them their lane.\n\nI don’t even need to kill them, they miss so much xp and lose plates off a roam that I’ll just win the lane hard.\n\nIf your lane opponent is an assassin you can’t easily roam on snydra.

When in doubt, start moving, move your camera, and see if it's worth following. If not just back off, worst case you lose a minion.\n\nLater on you can check your replay and see what was missing, maybe following a lost roam made you lose 2 plates, it really depends on the situation, just do x and see if doing y was better. Practice, really.\n\nI'll just add, the worst thing is not sticking with your decision.

You have to think of the variables during that specific game. For instance let's say you don't follow the roam but enemy jng shows up at turret to catch wave. That means you lose the roam and don't get mid. So once that happens you'll think oh ok I can't just shove and get plates if jng is nearby, etc. \n\nIf I follow the roam, can I actually catch up and kill someone, etc. \n\nIt kinda just comes as you play more. Only champion I play out of your 3 is Diana and tbh you should be the one roaming. I watched this Korean challenger Diana and tried to mimic similar to what he does. Literally all he does is just sit under turret till lvl 3. And then on repeat shoves fast and roams.

For instance, if they are roaming bot lane then 99% of the time I have already pinged the ever living hell out of bot lane to warn them.  \n\nInstead I will shove lane for cs, plates, and a back if I need it.  Usually people only roam when they get the chance depending on where the wave is or if they get a kill, etc.  so by the time you push out the wave enough to not lose minions then they’re already 75% of the way there.  \n\nThe dumb thing is that the more dangerous the opponent, the less likely it seems that my team will respond to pings lol. But that lane will be the first to throw everyone else under the bus for the 12/0 katarina with 5 cs. \n\nThis topic is all about opportunity cost.

Top and bot lanes are longer and allow more waves to pile up in slow pushes aka minions stay alive in lane longer. Mid has a shorter lane where minions get to lane faster and you can more easily break any freeze. You cannot get a 3-4 wave slow push mid like your can top and bot. So when you follow a roam from mid after your enemy mid is pushing, you are not losing that much xp and cs as if a top or not laner would roam on a wave pushing to them. Giving the enemy mid laner roams is a nightmare for early game. Preventing the enemy mid laner from roaming by poking them out of lane, killing them, or controlling the wave is what makes you win the lane. If you are playing diana, has good waveclear and good at 1v1s, you need to exert those strengths so the enemy isn’t able to roam. Level 1-5 may be a little tough into some matchups but then your jungler should realize that mid does not have prio and can’t go for some fight at scuttle at 3 or 4 minutes. You should also spam ping caution and that your lane is missing so they know not to do anything aggressive.\n\nYou want to follow roams where you can reach the same destination as the other mid laner roughly at the same time or less than 5 seconds apart. \n\nHere are 2 scenarios:\n\n1) The wave is in the middle of the lane and your junglers start fighting for the bot scuttle. Since you and the enemy mid have equal prio, you can rotate to the fight safely on your side of river even if the enemy mid leaves slightly before you. You can do this because you will get to the fight at roughly the same time and you will not miss much xp and cs mid from wave state.\n\n2) The enemy slow pushes in 2 waves into your turret and disappears. You have no vision in the enemy jungle or river and you do not see where the enemy mid laner went. The enemy mid could have either recalled, gank bot, gank top, or invaded your jungle somewhere. When you finally see the enemy mid fighting your jungler on their blue buff, he dies within 8 seconds of you seeing the enemy mid on the map. You has no clue where the enemy mid could have been so it was impossible to follow anywhere quick enough. If you were to see the enemy mid on vision in pixel bush walk into your jungle, now you just saved 10+ seconds of finding out where the enemy mid went and you CAN and SHOULD roam to help protect your jungle, if your team can win the 2v2 or if the friendly top comes for a 3v3. \n\nVision is extremely important in the game and definitely mid lane. I just pointed out how one pixel bush ward that you can get after u crash your can save or win you the game.\n\n## Comment ID jsmm8ud with +1 score by [(doom_man44, Reddit, 2023-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/153wjga/when_should_i_follow_my_lane_opponents_roam/jsmm8ud/) (in reply to ID 153wjga):\nI only roam if my wave is in a good state and the fight is moving towards me (on certain champions). Unless the fight is very close will I leave a doomed wave state (slow pushing towards you without laner -> good, crashing under your tower -> insanely bad, -> frozen near your tower -> slightly favored for you -> frozen near their tower -> pretty bad but could be mitigated, slow pushing towards them -> super doomed and do not roam, even wave -> go for it, shoving 1 wave won't do much against the enemy if they get a kill/double kill). A slightly frozen wave on your side of the map allows you to counter-roam farther. This is more important in top lane than mid, but both concepts apply I think.\n\n## Comment ID jsmny5n with +1 score by [(Hatchie_47, Reddit, 2023-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/153wjga/when_should_i_follow_my_lane_opponents_roam/jsmny5n/) (in reply to ID 153wjga):\nUnder any circumstances do not do it it's unsafe! If there is no vision between mid and the lane your opponent roams and you can't afford to facecheck them, do not attempt to follow them!

I’ll always try and go for the play that has the greatest net benefit, even if there’s a risk that I’ll take a hit if it goes bad (mainly because I know how to play from behind 9/10 times)\n\n## Comment ID jsoz1zg with +1 score by [(jforrest1980, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/153wjga/when_should_i_follow_my_lane_opponents_roam/jsoz1zg/) (in reply to ID 153wjga):\nI play Vladimir, so this may not pertain to you as much, except maybe with Syndra. The rule I follow is that if the roam is \"guaranteed\" to net more coin than staying in lane, then I will roam. Which is almost never. Staying for an extra wave, a plate, is more consistent than wasting time on a roam. You also need to consider the exp and gold you will deny the enemy laner that roamed, by punishing them for roaming (by shoving the wave).\n\nIf I see a laner leave, I will shove as hard as possible, get a plate if possible, and attempt to back to get an item advantage.\n\nYou also really need to consider that if you do roam, if you can win a potential jungle skirmish on the way.\n\nYou need to look at staying in lane, shoving, and backing, as a way to get a gold, exp, and item advantage. Those 3 things alone could be more valuable than 300 gold from a kill.\n\n## Comment ID jsyng33 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-07-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/153wjga/when_should_i_follow_my_lane_opponents_roam/jsyng33/) (in reply to ID 153wjga):\nOnly if you don’t die 1v1 if opponent decides to turn, on top of that they don’t have a big wave shoved under ur tower AND you’re 70 percent sure you win the 2v2"

      "# [Sonos Roam WILL NOT register](https://en.community.sonos.com/controllers-and-music-services-229131/sonos-roam-will-not-register-6894671)\nPage 1 / 1\n\nYep exactly the same problem here but interestingly I have 2 Sonos roams and this only happens with one of them. The other one works and updated to latest software. I have tried everything and thought the latest update to the app might fix it but it didn’t. Weird that it only affects one roam and not the other? Customer support has not been much help either. I think this might be a hardware issue as opposed to a software issue.\n\nwell…. At least I’m not the odd duck out here:) I got a replacement roam and ran into this issue when I was connecting it to my system last night. The Sonos support team has ALWAYS been exceptional and I have always just “chatted” with them online and always had my problem resolved. I see now that the humans aren’t available much and we’re getting stuck with a “Bot”… GRRRRRR If you’re listening Sonos, DO NOT GO DOWN THE AI road. Your tech staff have ALWAYS been exceptional and one of the reasons I buy Sonos products…..\n\nAnyhow, my question is why can’t there be a manual way to type in the info on my Sonos app/account to add the speaker????\n\nFYI, I CAN connect to my Roam via bluetooth…. Guess it’s gonna be my golf speaker for now….\n\nSOLVED Problem after trying Recommendation from another Thread!!!\n\nThe FIX was based on info in another thread. Make sure you have most updated Sonos software. Then SIGN OUT and... SIGN BACK into your Sonos account again. Then go through the steps you have probably done a dozen or more times (that all failed - LOL) - and your Roam should register with no issues.\n\nI have no idea why this particular step was needed (nowhere does Sonos recommend it) - but it did. Thanks to the other Sonos community members who provided this fix. Hope it works for others.\n\nTried all that. Signed in and out and in and out. Went through all the steps but still have a paperweight instead of a speaker. Can’t connect via Bluetooth. I see the Roam Not Registered in the app, which is the latest version and when I click Fix It it goes to Let’s finish adding your roam to your system, then There is an update that is available for your Sonos Roam that must be completed (several minutes) before you can use it, then Adding your Sonos Roam, then it flashes on the update screen for a second Tune with Trueplay Adapt the sound of your speakers to the acoustics of the room. Updating your product. This should take several minutes but a second later goes to We couldn't update your Sonos Roam. Check your Wi-Fi connection and try again later. Error code - 1,002 When I click Continue I get There was a problem adding your Sonos Roam to your system. Try again later.\n\nDoes anyone on here think 100 minutes wait time on hold for customer support is reasonable?\n\nI clicked for a call back and 4 hours later I missed the call as I was on a call to someone else and they never rang back.\n\nI do hope you all find a solution to your issues online because it looks like Sonos aren’t able to help with this one.\n\nSOLVED Problem after trying Recommendation from another Thread!!!\n\nThe FIX was based on info in another thread.

Thanks to the other Sonos community members who provided this fix. Hope it works for others.\n\nThis helped with the new App! Thanks a lot!\n\nSame issue. The registration could not be complete - got as far as the prompt to press the play button on top. Interestingly, one time I was prompted to press both the play and volume up button to the right and it sounded like something more was happening… but sadly no. In any case, I kept getting prompted to try again and to contact sonos. Ha! waiting time on phone was always well over 1 hour. I sent a message through the online help and never heard back. I have the updated app. I tried multiple times, on different phones and my ipad. I did a factory reset. I restarted my modem. I reinstalled the app. I crossed my fingers. Nothing worked.\n\nThe whole reason for getting a sonos portable product was to integrate it with the other sonos components I have. Unfortunately, I will now return it and just buy a (less expensive!) portable speaker.\n\nI think if/when it works it’s great but if not…..\n\nSOLVED Problem after trying Recommendation from another Thread!!!\n\nThe FIX was based on info in another thread.

I was getting very frustrated! 8-)\n\nThanks for the suggestion. In the course of uninstalling and reinstalling the app I logged out and back in and it didn’t work. I read another thread indicating the issue may be with the ROAM SL and that when the user returned the SL and got the newer version of the ROAM it all worked as expected. Just to clarify, I was able to set up the speaker and use it via bluetooth but I couldn’t group it with the other Sonos speakers I have (two Ones and a Beam). Also - connectivity on bluetooth wasn’t great - it dropped several times, with my phone right next to it. I just sent back the SL and am going to try again. This time with the newer model (ROAM 2). Will report back :)\n\nOn another note - I can’t believe I was never able to connect with someone from Sonos to problem solve and/or figure out an exchange. When submitting the request for a return, there was no option for trying to “make it right” before just returning. On the plus side, it was easy to return. Hopefully I won’t have to do this again with the new one!\n\nOn another note - I can’t believe I was never able to connect with someone from Sonos to problem solve and/or figure out an exchange.

Hopefully I won’t have to do this again with the new one!\n\nI suspect that Sonos Support is very busy right now with the chaos cause by the new App.\n\nIf you have to return a Move 2 I think it will show that the new App is messing up Sonos even more that I thought.\n\nI ordered the Roam 2. But maybe I could have waited a bit more and tried again. The latest app update from 4 days ago might have fixed the problem! Now I will never know… unless I can’t set up the Roam 2!\n\nAfter spending at least 12 combined hours of trying to get my new roam to connect, update and register I finally got it to work. I connected the roam to my existing system but it needed a firmware update and would not register. I kept either getting stuck on the update needed screen or it would try to update and I would go between error codes 1000 and/or 1002. I tried multiple fixes found online (transferring account to myself, signing in and out multiple times, resetting Sonos app within the app, uninstalling and reinstalling app, trying from multiple devices (IOS, Android - both phones and tablets))\n\nToday after signing in and out of the app about 50 times I downloaded the desktop app and reset my mobile apps. The desktop app initialized the firmware update and was successful. I then signed back in to the mobile app and initialized the registration, I was prompted to use the microphone to verify it or enter the PIN at the bottom of the roam. I opted to enter the PIN manually. It then started to chime and prompted me to press the play/pause button. After trying this multiple times I kept getting a message something like “could not verify the button has been pressed”. I then went to my home screen on my phone while leaving the Sonos app on the screen asking to “try again”. I opened my settings and removed all Sonos app permissions and then immediately reenabled all permissions. I went back into the Sonos app and “tried again”. This time the button press registered and prompted me to press the play/pause and volume up button at the same time. That finally registered the roam and I am now able to use it. An extremely frustrating experience to say the least. Hope this helps save someone some time trying to get their roam working and/or avoiding spending hours on hold with customer care.\n\nWhich version of the roam do you have? Roam SL, Roam or Roam 2?\n\nWhich version of the roam do you have? Roam SL, Roam or Roam 2?\n\nI have the Roam\n\nUPDATE. I gave up on setting up the Roam SL and returned it. I ordered the Roam 2 and it was just delivered. In less than 5 minutes, I unpacked it, plugged it in, updated the software and set it all up.\n\nThere must be an issue with Roam and Roam SL?\n\nThere should be some sort of bulletin about the Roam/RoamSL set up issues!!\n\nSo - as another reader wrote - the solution is to return the Roam/Roam SL and order a Roam 2!\n\nI had a problem with the Sonos Roam 2. Updated to the latest version of the app. Went through the setup, and the app indicated there was a problem with the setup, and directed me to turn off the roam 2, turn back on, and register the speaker through the settings. I tried this several times, and the product would not register. I have an Orbi RBRE960 router. I updated the firmware for the router via the mobile orbi app. After the firmware update for the router was complete, I tried to register the sonos roam 2, and it worked perfectly. Hope this helps.\n\nTried all that. Signed in and out and in and out. Went through all the steps but still have a paperweight instead of a speaker. Can’t connect via Bluetooth. I see the Roam Not Registered in the app, which is the latest version and when I click Fix It it goes to Let’s finish adding your roam to your system, then There is an update that is available for your Sonos Roam that must be completed (several minutes) before you can use it, then Adding your Sonos Roam, then it flashes on the update screen for a second Tune with Trueplay Adapt the sound of your speakers to the acoustics of the room. Updating your product. This should take several minutes but a second later goes to We couldn't update your Sonos Roam. Check your Wi-Fi connection and try again later. Error code - 1,002 When I click Continue I get There was a problem adding your Sonos Roam to your system. Try again later.\n\nDoes anyone on here think 100 minutes wait time on hold for customer support is reasonable?\n\nI clicked for a call back and 4 hours later I missed the call as I was on a call to someone else and they never rang back.\n\nI do hope you all find a solution to your issues online because it looks like Sonos aren’t able to help with this one.\n\nThank you, at least I feel I’m not going crazy, I too have bought a paper weight Roam and was similarily gaslit by SONOS support with byzantine, dead-end instructions, error codes and non-fixes.\n\nMy issue slightly different as the above fixes didn't work. It was down to the auto steering setting on the router. I turned that off, forced the roam to use the 2.4 GHz band on the router, then once it registered switched auto steering back on. All good now.\n\nJust got a Roam 2 delivered. Won’t register to my account. Tired the sign and sign out fix..it didn’t fix. I don’t have hours and hours to sort this.Will be returning. This issue comes on top of multiple addressing issues and the inability of the sales team to see what address DHL had been given by them! Oh Sonos what a fall from being such a great company. Where did it all go wrong?? Poor hires into operations?\n\nWaited on hold for 30 minutes then gave up.\n\nAfter spending at least 12 combined hours of trying to get my new roam to connect, update and register I finally got it to work.

And if instead of join an existing system, I click on start a new system, it just takes me back to the webpage where I downloaded the app. This is just nuts\n\nSOLVED: By way of update for anyone else in my position, I’m including what worked for me. And I would just echo the astounding INCOMPETENCE of the customer service agents at Sonos, none of whom came up with this solution themselves, and in fact even gave me incorrect information about my router being incompatible (it’s not even on the sonos list of incompatible but workable devices, let alone the fully incompatible list) just so they could get off the phone. I’m sorry, but the level of idiocy and lack of training is out of control\n\nMy set up is as follows: have a spectrum router (SAX2V1S), a sonos boost, two fives and subwoofer and now a roam. I had used the boost to successfully add the fives and the sub, but when adding the roam I kept getting 1,002 and 1,008 as errors, both of which deal with not being able to update the roam. I would add the roam but then get stuck after trying the “fix it” button when it said the roam was “not registered”. I tried downloading the desktop app but my roam wouldn’t appear and there were no prompts to update anything (despite this being a solution widely reported by others)\n\nSince the roam apparently doesn’t work with the boost, I did the following: disconnected the boost and restarted my router and set it to 2.4ghz (the spectrum app has a setting where it just transmits in 2.4ghz for 30 minutes if you click a button in the spectrum app). I then factory reset my roam and at that point I deleted my sonos app and reinstalled it and then when the time came I clicked on set up a new system. It recognized the roam and had me do the same thing as before where I needed to further update the roam after the initial steps of adding the roam, except this time it actually started and finished the update without an error message\n\nI then basically reversed everything. I reconnected the boost to my router, I restarted the router and then unplugged and replugged my boost. After everything was done rebooting, I logged into sonos app and it recognized my initial setup of the two fives and the subwoofer (if yours doesn’t do that, you may need to delete and reinstall the sonos app so that it forgets the new system that you set up with just your roam and recognizes the old system again). Finally, I factory reset the roam again and added it to my system with the two fives and the subwoofer, but this time it asked me to do some other steps such as playing a chime from the roam and then pressing the play and plus buttons at the same time, and VOILA, the roam was added successfully and plays music along with the rest of my system\n\nI must end by again mentioning the COMPLETE LACK OF UTILITY from the ENTIRE Sonos customer service team (or at least the 8 different people, including supervisors, that I spoke to across three days, four phone calls, three web chats and 9 hours)\n\nWow the sign out trick worked.\n\nOne of the worst unboxing experience I’ve ever had. Too bad because the only reason I didnt buy a 7th Bose was my experience with the full Sonos system at a friend’s.\n\nDespite good sound and a now working Roam 2, would NOT recommend it to anyone due to the first time user experience requiring digging through forums to resolve.",

Could be worth some thread merging down the line, but I will leave it alone for now or for TR reps to handle if they see the need.\n\nthat thread title is misleading in that this is a 2025 item??? which is why I did not look there for some “2025 news” but thanks for not merging it.\n\nThe reddit account is brand new and named “anotherwahooligan” which I believe people who work there call themselves . Also their device flair on that sub is “Rival” which is a give away because only people who work at Wahoo use the Rival watch .\n\nin the Wahoo community, ie their forum etc, that is a really common thing to talk about a Wahooligan. The other interesting thing is how many cycling news outlets have jumped on this. It would be interesting if it is a farce. Only time will tell.\n\nLooks like a new head unit is launching from Wahoo on 3rd Dec. What are we expecting any new features to include? I love my Roam (v1) but it’s due a refresh and the v2 didn’t offer anything compelling for me so hoping this could be more than just a bump in storage.",

      "# [Wahoo ACE Cycling GPS In-Depth Review: The Best or Unbaked? by Ray Maker on 2024-12-03](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/12/wahoo-elemnt-ace-in-depth-review-bike-computer.html)\nAfter years of waiting, we’ve finally got a new Wahoo cycling GPS – and it’s a beast. At least, in terms of size and weight. And in the future, Wahoo also hopes in terms of features and position in the market. The new unit sports a full color touchscreen display, roughly similar to that of cell phones, while also including a speaker, bike-bell, and wind sensor. Of course, like other high-end bike computers introduced this year, it also includes a much higher price tag – $599USD.\n\nUnfortunately, to spoil this review – it’s half-baked. It’s missing a vast array of features that previously existed on every other Wahoo bike computer to date, it’s even missing features listed on the front of the box and marketing site, and the battery life falls far short of claims. I’d argue this is the perfect product to see which reviewers are actually riding with it, versus just taking pretty shots of it.\n\nBut, we’re getting ahead of ourselves here. I’ve been riding the crap out of it, everything from near-daily 3-4 hour rides, to mountain biking, structured workouts, gravel riding, and more. All with the goal of figuring out what actually works.\n\nFinally, note that this unit is a media loaner, and once this review is complete, it will go back to Wahoo. As always, I don’t accept advertising from any company I review – so, if you found this review useful, consider becoming a DCR Supporter, which gets you an ad-free site, plus the behind-the-scenes video series between both myself (and my wife) on everything that happens in the DCR Sports Tech Cave/universe.\n\nHow it Differs:\n\nIn some ways, it’s hard to compare a watermelon to a kiwi, as that’s roughly what it’s like comparing the Wahoo ACE to a Wahoo ROAM. So yes, while both are fruit (bike computers), beyond that, they are actually quite a bit different – both good and bad. Still, assuming the standard Wahoo bike computer as a baseline (which is a massive assumption as you’ll see), here are the most notable differences:\n\n– Increased size of unit a cargo-ship-sized boatload\n\n– Increased screen size to 3.8” (2.7” on ROAM V2)\n\n– Increased screen colors to 16 million (64 colors on ROAM V2)\n\n– Added touchscreen capability\n\n– Added a very loud bike bell (digital)\n\n– Added voice navigation prompts\n\n– Added wind sensor\n\n– Added new sensor pairing dashboard\n\n– Added map layers option\n\n– Added street names on maps to (some) streets\n\n– Added Activity Profiles (e.g., Road/MTB/etc…)\n\n– Added time to upper edge, and always-on/seen\n\n– Revamped ‘Ready to Ride’ dashboard\n\n– Changed to Wahoo App (from Wahoo ELEMNT App)\n\n– Changed a ton of the user interface\n\n– No more lights/LEDs along upper edge\n\n– No Live Tracking yet (firmware update in H1 2025)\n\n– No Strava Live Segments yet (firmware update in H1 2025)\n\n– No more full-route elevation view (coming in TBD update)\n\n– No more filtering of routes on device (coming in TBD update)\n\n– No more naming of saved locations (coming in TBD update)\n\n– No more custom alerts (e.g., hydration/nutrition alerts, coming in update)\n\n– No more choosing location on Wahoo App map to route to (only device)\n\n– No more changing gear ratios (electronic shifting) in new Wahoo app\n\n– No nacho cheese dispenser\n\n– No TrainerRoad Outside Workouts at present (‘coming soon’)\n\n– Increased battery life claim to 30 hours (Note: This isn’t even vaguely close to real, as I’ll show)\n\n– Increased internal storage from 32GB to 64GB (for maps)\n\n– Included new aluminum mount (versus plastic previously)\n\n– Removed screw for bike computer to mount (allowed UCI Pro teams to count unit weight as bike weight)\n\n– Price is $599USD/$849CAD/€599EUR/£549GBP/$999AUD/¥99,000JPY\n\nNow, when it comes to features that are in the pipeline, Wahoo has confirmed some of them, per the table below, though, many of the ones listed above don’t have exact dates yet.\n\nThe first set is these updates not in the 2025 table:\n\n“Planned December 2024 Updates. A post launch update will take place in December. This update will include the following features below:\n\n– Strava Live Segments\n\n– Offline configuration support (to supplement cloud based architecture)\n\n– “Workout Profiles” rebrand to “Activity Profiles”\n\n– Additional UI/UX Refinement and bug fixes”\n\nAnd then the second category is this, for H1 2025 and H2 2025.\n\nFor example, language support includes focusing on French, German, Spanish, and then the remaining 14 languages Wahoo currently supports. Today, it’s only English on the ACE. For advanced route management, that’s allowing you to ride routes on a trainer, while showing the virtual route location on your map on the ACE.\n\nIn the case of the battery optimizations, they’re aiming to strike a better balance between the 5-second timeout mode, and the Auto mode, basically in hopes of getting the battery life better within Auto, versus the only way to get good battery life today is 5-second mode (more on that later).\n\nFor H2, they’re looking at additional map layers such as custom POIs from Strava or Komoot, as well as some functions around the wind sensor, including breaking out how much power is required to overcome the grade (on a climb, steep or otherwise) vs wind (which might help on positioning). These are all certainly interesting ideas. Though, I fear some of these aspirations could become derailed with trying to get all the existing features ported first, before they can focus on new items.\n\nSo with that, let’s get into the box.\n\nIn the Box:\n\nFirst up we’ll quickly get the unit unboxed. Inside, you’ll find the ACE just chilling:\n\nBut here’s what’s inside the box once you get rid of all the paper. Kudos to Wahoo in that there’s no plastic in the box.\n\nInside you’ve got:\n\n– The beefcake of a bike computer (ACE)\n\n– The beefcake of a metal mount\n\n– The lanyard to tether the ACE in case it snaps the mount\n\n– The USB-C cable to charge it\n\n– A warranty paper you’ll never read.\n\nHere’s a few close-up shots of all those things.\n\nOk, let’s get into the size. Or, over the size. Or, wrap ourselves around the size.\n\nThe Size:\n\nLike it or not, the size is going to be a polarizing aspect of the Wahoo ACE. And it’s near impossible to understand in photos. It’s not really due to any singular dimension, but rather, the complete girthiness of it. It’s a tank in all ways.\n\nOfficially it measures 208g on the scale, but it’s mostly the thickness and width you’ll notice. Here’s how it looks side-by-side:\n\nThe thing is, I’m a unique duck here. I’m used to all assortment of stupid-large things on my handlebars for testing, including drone remote controls and more. So frankly, the size actually doesn’t bother me. Neither does the weight.\n\nHowever, it’s impossible not to notice it. It’s huge. Wahoo says much of the size is to account for the larger battery, which in turn provides it with a claimed 30 hours of battery life (a number I can’t get *anywhere near* in my testing).\n\nWhen it comes to mounts, it has much the same problem as the Edge 1050 did at launch – it needs an XL mount of some sort. In Wahoo’s case though, that’s actually twofold. First, it needs a strong (realistically metal) mount to support the much heavier weight. Very heavy, so heavy in fact that Wahoo is specifically not designing a GoPro adapter for the bottom of their mount because the combined weight will likely snap it (after hitting a pothole or cobbles).\n\nHere’s their stock mount on my mountain bike:\n\nThe second piece is the length. It needs to be long enough to handle that, which is longer than the Edge 1050, but because the mount is centered differently than the Edge 1050, it can squeeze into most Edge 1050 compatible mounts. But barely. In the case of my Canyon bike with the stock Canyon out-front mounts, it basically skids (physically touches) across the handlebar as I rotate inwards:\n\nBut it does get in there, after snuggling. And that particular mount is designed to support a light on the bottom, so it’s used to the weight. Though, I haven’t tried it with both Wahoo ACE + Light to see if it’ll snap. Here’s to hoping it doesn’t.\n\nThe point is, this will be frustrating for some users (actually, many users) who want to mount a GoPro or other action camera below. The combined weight is simply well beyond what any mount on the market today is going to safely handle (I’ve snapped metal mounts with far less weight on them). Hopefully we’ll see some viable Ace+GoPro mounts soon. After all, Wahoo does have GoPro action cam control on the unit.\n\nRiding Basics:\n\nProbably the first thing you’ll need to know is now you’ll be using Wahoo’s new bike computer app on your smartphone, simply called ‘Wahoo’. Previously with their bike computers, you used the Wahoo ELEMNT app. But over the last year or two, Wahoo’s been slowly moving devices under the consolidated Wahoo App instead. At a high level, this works. But if you’re a long-time Wahoo user, you’ll quickly find the gaps for which there are no solutions.\n\nWithin the Wahoo app, you’ll pair up the Wahoo ACE, as well as link any partner accounts you have, like Strava, TrainingPeaks, or Komoot. However, the list is a bit messy right now. A number of the existing Wahoo partners aren’t working in the new Wahoo app/platform, which is required for the ACE.\n\nFurther, one thing that’s rather silly, is that by default, it won’t automatically upload your completed activities to each of these platforms. You have to expand out the box and check ‘Auto-Share’. Why?!? So much why.\n\nWithin the Wahoo app, you can set up heart rate zone, and power zones (plus bits like metric/imperial/custom display of measurements).\n\nNext, this is the first Wahoo cycling computer to support sport/bike profiles, such as creating a set of data pages for road cycling, and a different one for mountain biking. To do so, you’ll open the Wahoo app, and then select to ‘Add Workout Profile’. Here you’ll choose something within the ‘Cycling’ category, in order to get it to show up on the ACE:\n\nHere I’ve created a Mountain Biking profile, where I can then configure workout pages, alerts, general settings (such as Auto Lap), as well as heart rate zones:\n\nWhen it comes to workout data pages, there’s a boatload of options as before, both in terms of custom data fields, as well as dedicated pages like Music Control, GoPro Control, and Strava Live Segments (when that feature gets rolled out in a few months).\n\nAnd, because someone in the comments section got really angry that I didn’t show how many data fields the map page can display, here ya go, all the data fields – including the elevation data field at the bottom, and wind on the side.\n\nOnce you’ve got all that configured, you can then select it at the top of your ACE:\n\nAfter which, all of your data pages/settings/etc will be available for that ride.\n\nBut here’s the (extremely annoying) rub: This won’t correctly tag the ride type on Strava or other platforms upon upload. The *singular* feature that people have been asking for, for countless years, Wahoo hasn’t completed. Thus everything is listed on Strava as a generic ride, unless you go on Strava and manually toggle it to Mountain Bike, Gravel, etc…\n\nWahoo says that adding in the correct sub-type is on their near-term radar, but they don’t have a timeframe for it. Keeping in mind, this is literally just a single field in the .FIT file they have to set.\n\nNow, one of the things you’ll notice is the new sensor pairing menu at the bottom. This shows your paired sensors, and whether or not they’re connected. It even has nifty-proper icons for each of them.\n\nIn fact, kudos to Wahoo here. Not only did they make picture-perfect icons for all their own devices (e.g. Wahoo POWRLINK Zero power meter pedals look like Wahoo speedplay pedals), but they also did it for at least some other power meters. For example, the Garmin Rally pedals look roughly like Garmin Rally pedals. Quarq cranksets and Favero power pedals just look like generic crank arms. Still, well done Wahoo.\n\nWhen it comes to shifting, you can pair up both ANT+ Shifting (e.g. SRAM eTAP/AXS) as well as Shimano Di2. In the case of both, you can use the remote shifter buttons to change data pages or set a lap marker. However, at present the new Wahoo App doesn’t support customizing gear ratios like the Wahoo ELEMNT app did.\n\nNow, that said, I will note that it seems to take a little longer than I’d like to find sensors sometimes. Not a huge deal, but it’s not quite as instant as Wahoo’s other devices or Garmin/Hammerhead. Sometimes it’s more like 20-30 seconds before it seems to notice its sensor friends are awake.\n\nStill, once it finds it, I’ve had zero issues on all my rides across numerous bikes, including: SRAM AXS RED XPLR (and FORCE AXS), Shimano Di2, Quarq power meters, Favero Assioma MX power meter, Garmin Rally power meter, Wahoo TRACKR heart rate sensor, Garmin HRM-PRO Plus HR sensor, and Garmin Varia RTL-515 radar.\n\nSo with all that configured, let’s go and ride. Again, I’ll cover navigation later on. As you ride, you’ll see your data pages automatically displayed. You can swipe through them using your fingers, or press the page button:\n\nYou’ll notice above the coloring for my heart rate and wattage, this is based on my zones. It’s a nice touch that Wahoo has, and also appears in other fields, like gradient.\n\nWahoo also has the concept of increasing/decreasing data field quantities. Meaning, by simply pressing the up/down buttons (on the right side), it’ll change how many data fields are displayed on the page, per the priority you set on the app. As you do this, it’ll change how big each field is. Such as below:\n\nNote that while Wahoo got rid of the LED bar seen on past Wahoo computers, it does retain much of that same concept through colorized data fields and a strip that updates at the top of the screen. Further, I appreciate always having the time displayed at the top of the screen, no matter what data page you’re on. They also use that area to display upcoming turns (albeit, kinda late usually).\n\nNext, regardless of whether you have a route enabled or not, you’ll automatically get upcoming climb information. As you approach a climb, it’ll automatically trigger and show you details of that upcoming climb, such as this:\n\nYou’ll see details about the gradient displayed within the color of the chevrons on the map. You can tap through a few different data pages that show details about the climb.\n\nNext, you can execute structured workouts from Wahoo’s own app, or TrainingPeaks. At present, TrainerRoad is not yet supported. As part of the migration to the Wahoo App, these connections haven’t been completed yet. And others are missing as well. TrainerRoad says that’s coming soon.\n\nIn any case, you can open up the structured workout on the workouts page to see a list of scheduled workouts. In my case, I manually created one in TrainingPeaks, since my TrainerRoad ones weren’t coming through anymore.\n\nAs you execute it, you’ll see details about each step automatically, and alerts accordingly…sometimes. You see, there’s a ton of bugs here.\n\n– Skipped showing the progress bar during the warmup\n\n– Didn’t show any interval alerts if I wasn’t on the interval page (so if I was on another data page, zero notification of the start of an interval) [Update: It apparently does, except that option is now hidden deep in a menu setting, and set for default off. Why? WHY?!?!]\n\n– Didn’t adhere to TrainingPeaks ‘pause till lap’ option\n\n– Didn’t show my current power line, as Wahoo’s own marketing site says it should\n\nI do like the little pop-over at the bottom, but again, it only shows on the workout page, which kinda defeats the point of a popover.\n\nAnd here’s Wahoo’s page (main Wahoo ACE site), indicating I should be seeing my actual power line shown, but it doesn’t work either:\n\nFinally, with everything finished, you can end your ride. Here you’ll get a ride summary screen, with information as such:\n\nThat said, one super frustrating piece is that despite having the new activity profiles (e.g., Mountain Bike, Gravel, etc…), none of those carry into Strava. Wahoo isn’t setting that attribute like all of their competitors are, and thus, you’ll still need to update these in Strava after the fact.\n\nNonetheless, all of your data otherwise does appear correctly there.\n\nThe Bike Bell:\n\nI was going to include the bike bell within the ‘Basics’ section above, but I figured I’d break it out. If for no other reason than to have one section that’s mostly positive.\n\nSomewhat humorously, Wahoo seemed keen to hide its best feature. All of Wahoo’s initial PR efforts almost entirely ignored the bike bell. Thankfully, at the last minute, they changed their mind. The Wahoo digital bike bell allows you to double-tap the screen to instantly hear a very loud and audible bike bell sound. It’s virtually indistinguishable from the Garmin Edge 1050 bike bell/sound.\n\nIt’s hard to visually show you the bike bell, because there’s no menu item. It just exists audibly, and as noted, you can double-tap anywhere on the screen to make it sound instantly. Well, sorta.\n\nAs long as that screen isn’t the map screen. For some odd reason, it doesn’t work on the map screen. Or the workout screen. Or the elevation screens. Wahoo said that was because there were concerns about people using touch on that map screen and thus accidentally ding-donging. Except, by default, touch on the map screen is already disabled (it has that little lock icon at right). Thus, no amount of rubby-rubby would have moved the map anyway. Certainly, simply unlocking the screen would have disabled the bike bell? Or, using the accelerometer to detect a double-tap would have been possible, no?\n\nIn any event, that (moderate) annoyance aside, the bike bell is awesome. You can also tap just below the pause button in the center of the screen:\n\nOne other thing to note about the bike bell is that it’s *always* at full volume. Meaning, no matter what settings you configure the rest of your audio alerts for (e.g. a less imposing volume), the bike bell remains the same volume. I actually appreciate this.\n\nHowever, I should also mention that unfortunately there is no method to configure the bike bell from the shifter buttons like on the Garmin Edge 1050 (or Hammerhead Karoo 3), which allows you to configure the extra shifter/bonus buttons to trigger the bike bell, which is super cool. Hopefully Wahoo will add that down the road.\n\nNavigation:\n\nWhen it comes to navigation, the ACE can route much the same as past Wahoo devices, though, there are some differences to be aware of that we’ll dive into.\n\nFirst though, is getting routes to your device. For most people, those routes will come from platforms like Strava, Komoot or other 3rd party entities. That said, you can import GPX/FIT/TCX files directly into it, using the Files app on your phone, and opening it with the Wahoo app. Or selecting a previous route from history.\n\nOnce that’s done, it’ll show up on the ‘Routes’ listing on your device, such as this:\n\nThat said, at the moment, this Routes listing is a giant shaker bottle of routes, without any ability to order the routes. In my case, I had Strava routes from years ago imported in, which is fine. But what’s not fine is that I can’t sort them in any way. I can only search them by name, which then requires me to remember exactly what I named each route that someone else might have created. Most bike computers, including all of Wahoo’s existing ones, have a sorting option at the top (such as by Date, A-Z, Starred, Length, and Proximity – as is the case on the Wahoo ROAM V2).\n\nDespite showing this on Wahoo’s marketing site, it’s not there today:\n\nWahoo says this will come at some point, hopefully soon. This is one of a number of examples of things being shown on the box, that are not on the unit in real-life.\n\nIn any case, once you’ve managed to find your route and select it, you’ll see an elevation profile and overview of the route.\n\nI do appreciate the easy option to ‘Reverse’ the route though, something that despite all logic and years of requests, doesn’t exist on a Garmin Edge series device (but does exist on their wearables).\n\nWith the route loaded, we’ll head out riding. If we were to look at the map page first, you’ll see the route as a series of chevrons on the route line. Moreover, the color of those chevrons indicates the climb gradients as you ride along, which is clever/handy:\n\nI do appreciate the coloring and map styles here. The way Wahoo has selected to colorize the different bits of info on the map screen (such as other streets/landscapes/etc…) makes this screen really easy to understand, and the thick chevrons make it easy to confirm your direction at a glance. That said, when dimmed (as effectively required to get half-decent battery life), it’s much harder to read.\n\nIf you tap the layers icon, you can adjust various map layers, including points of interest, custom waypoints, street names, wind, and Summit Segments. Note that in this context, ‘Wind’ doesn’t mean an overlay of the wind direction/forecast, but rather, just wind from the wind sensor.\n\nNote that Wahoo does include street names now on some streets. I haven’t quite figured out the exact pattern to which streets it shows them on, and which zoom levels. While some people love street names on maps, I rarely use them either way – likely because I’m more interested in the actual route line itself, which Wahoo does a good job on. I think they’ve found a good balance between the coloring of the map and the clarity of the chevron line.\n\n(Top: Wahoo ACE, left COROS Dura, right Hammerhead Karoo 3, bottom Garmin Edge 1050, right handlebar – badly in need of new bar tape.)\n\nLikewise, you can tap to enable the cue sheet as well at any time, if you’d prefer to see that:\n\nIn the event you’re on another data page (not the map page), and you have an upcoming turn, it’ll show a turn written prompt and give you an audible alert, and even voice directions to turn.\n\nBut again, there are two problems here. First, by default, none of these occur. You need to enable these voice turn alerts in the settings. Why on earth navigation and voice prompts aren’t enabled by default is beyond my pay grade.\n\nHowever, that gets to the second issue, the speaker volume. To be very clear: The speaker is loud AF (which is great for certain things). Seriously, it’s bone-jarringly loud. So loud your riding buddies will quickly try and body-check you into the nearest herd of cows they can find.\n\nFear not though, Wahoo has a solution for that, the volume slider. This slider has three levels: Loud AF, blah, and unbearable.\n\nFor navigation voice prompts, Loud AF is OK. I’d quibble that the voice should be slightly higher pitched, so it’s easier to hear in the wind, but that’s an easy change they could make. However, once you go down to the middle option, the voice is impossible to hear in the wind. And while the bike bell ignores the volume settings (as it should), there isn’t a way to separate voice prompt volume from the rest of the beeps your unit makes.\n\nAgain, their competitors have two sliders for a reason here: Voices are harder to hear in the wind than high-pitched beeps. Anyone who’s gone on a ride with friends knows this.\n\nIn any case, back to our ride. The next piece is your route profile that’s showing the elevation profile up ahead, seen at the bottom there. That elevation profile shows the next 2KM of your route….and only the next 2KM of your route:\n\nWhile past Wahoo units allowed far greater lengths than that (cough…the entire route), the ACE is limited here to 2KM.\n\nOnce again, the Wahoo box (and everything on the Wahoo site) shows this enumerating the full route as an elevation profile (showing ’Total’). And again, I’m not trying to be nit-picky here, but rather illustrating that this unit simply isn’t ready. Hard stop.\n\nI know this may come as a surprise to some: But stop shipping products that don’t do what it says on the box and your marketing site. Simply delay. The fastest way to get a reviewer angry is to literally not do the thing printed on the front of your box.\n\nNext, when it comes to on-demand routing, you can save locations at any point and navigate back to them, as well as drag to a point on the map (on unit) and route to it. Both of these are under the ‘routes’ option, then ‘Route To’ option).\n\nThese worked perfectly fine, and instantly, for me. Except the ability to rename saved waypoints, that doesn’t work at all right now. Thus, it’s just named whatever random street name you tapped (not ‘Home’ or ‘Work’ or ‘Hot Dog Stand’). Wahoo says that’s on the way too, though that too is listed as being a current feature on their marketing site.\n\nLikewise, the ability to select a point on the map from the Wahoo app doesn’t work either anymore (coming soonish). However, you can send a location from Google Maps or Apple Maps to the Wahoo app, and that worked intermittently for me.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that there are existing navigation providers that Wahoo hasn’t yet ported to the new Wahoo app yet. There’s no timelines on these, other than the second half of next year. But exactly which ones are getting re-added isn’t clear.\n\nThe Wind Sensor:\n\nRepeat after me: This is not an aero sensor, this is not an aero sensor, this is not an aero sensor.\n\nIt is however, a wind sensor capable of measuring wind speed coming into it. And while most aero sensors have that same starting point, that’s about where it ends. In fact, the jump from measuring aerodynamic drag is massive – but not so much hardware, rather, software and user education. It’s why almost every company that enters the cycling aero sensor landscape has failed. And almost all of those remaining that haven’t failed, have invariably pivoted towards coaching services instead. So get aero sensor out of your head, and let’s focus on what it actually is.\n\nInstead, the Wahoo ACE has a wind sensor for measuring the wind speed, then combining it with your known ground speed, and calculating whether you’ve got a headwind, tailwind, or some sort of drafting boost. It calls this “Wahoo Wind Dynamics”, which admittedly makes me giggle a little bit like a 6-year-old boy and think about the “wind dynamics” after eating Taco Bell.\n\nWhile riding, Wahoo gives you a single color-coded data field, titled Airspeed, which is shown in either Airspeed MPH or Airspeed KPH, just like the below (lower half is Airspeed, I’ve added ground speed to the upper half):\n\nThe coloring is basically the following groupings:\n\nThe idea being that you can quantify how much you’re saving when you tuck in behind someone to draft, because you’ll see those two numbers differ. If the AirSpeed is higher than the ground speed, you’ve got a headwind. If it’s lower, you’ve either got a tailwind or are drafting.\n\nI could then take the ground speed number, compare it to the airspeed number, do some mental math, and figure out exactly what the wind speed is (tailwind or headwind). Which…is yes, as silly as it sounds. To me, I shouldn’t have to be doing mental math on a ride constantly. It should simply do this automatically, and instead show me the final number – as either a headwind or tailwind/draft.\n\nAt the end of the ride, you’ll see the numbers shown on the unit with percentages of time spent in the different color-coded zones (labeled as either AirBoost or AirDrag):\n\nMy complaint here isn’t adding a wind sensor to the Wahoo bike computer. Instead, it’s that it’s just not providing any value beyond what I already know. And the singular area it could have provided value (showing impacts of drafting), is far too cumbersome of a number to be constantly doing mental math on. Just give me a number that we’re all calculating in our heads anyway.\n\nLong term, it remains to be seen how Wahoo can leverage this differently. I don’t see any viable path for Wahoo to use this for CdA calculations. Plenty of companies have tried, and given up there. Not because the tech wasn’t ready, but because 98% of riders don’t understand the *VAST* amounts of knowledge required to get proper aero testing done. Silly things like knowing the difference between your shoulders being firm or relaxed will hugely impact testing. Or that moving your fingers 1cm will impact testing. Or doing multiple test runs, etc…\n\nIt’s why virtually every aero sensor company on the market today that started life as a consumer aero sensor company/device, has shifted to being a coaching device, whereby the coach goes and does a seminar first to learn how to use the aero sensor, and then spends an absurd amount of time with athletes ensuring they execute tests correctly.\n\nPoint is, I feel like that weight could have been much better spent on an LED light (even as an emergency light because you’re running behind, or a built-in safety camera (akin to Cycliq Fly12), or…anything else.\n\nNow, all that said, for those geeks in the crowd, I will give Wahoo credit for properly populating the .FIT File with this data. In fact, they populate it with much more data than they show you on the screen. This includes the raw wind speed values, the categorization value (which of those color coded categories above), as well as a power to grade ratio value that they’ve been playing with in Alpha testing (you just don’t see the data field on our units, as that’s not available yet).\n\nIf you load any ACE file into the DCR Analyzer, you can see all this data using the ‘Developer Field’ toggle (which simply shows .FIT file data fields). Here’s the windy ride I did in the Netherlands with the 50KPH winds that day:\n\nNow, there’s a lot to look at. I’ve set my dot/curser at the highest wind point, where you can see the wind categorization is higher. The wind speed is shown in 1000 x m/s (meters/second), otherwise known as millimeters/second. The cool part is the data is there for people to use.\n\nAnd most critically, they do separate out the wind speed component here. Thus, I’d love for them to allow/show me a data field with just the wind speed component too. Note, that if you want to play with that original .FIT file, it’s located under the download link on the DCR Analyzer set page.\n\nBattery Burn:\n\nLook, it’s not good. There’s no two ways to say it. It falls *FAR* short of their claims of 30 hours of battery life, and is roughly in line with the Hammerhead Karoo 3’s battery life when the Karoo 3 is at 50% brightness (which is far brighter than the ACE screen can go). It falls behind the Garmin Edge 1050’s battery burn, and is leagues behind the Edge 1040 or Edge 1040 Solar battery. Again, in real-life numbers.\n\nSo, let’s look at the official claim and then a crap-ton of testing I’ve done. Officially, the claim is simply “up to 30+ hours”, depending on which part of the site you look at. Here’s the quote from their press release:\n\nBut in subsequent conversations, Wahoo clarified the actual claim is ’30 hours of GPS battery life with the backlight in 5-second off setting’. This means that after 5 seconds of touching the unit, the backlight turns off, and is unreadable depending on your lighting conditions. When in direct sunlight – no problems. But in the winter shade? Problems, especially on screens with smaller fonts (more data fields), or zoomed out maps.\n\nEven worse, the default configuration setting for the Wahoo ACE is the so-called “Auto” mode, which basically changes the backlight constantly, though short of summer sun on the beach, it seems to keep it at 100%. In that mode, I was burning roughly 8-12%/hour (across numerous 3-4 hour rides), depending on exactly which screen I was on. Yes, that puts it on target for 10-15 hours of battery life.\n\nThe ‘best’ battery scenario I could muster was 5.71%/hour (thus 17-hours) when I set it for 5-second off, on a mountain bike ride two days ago. Though, one couldn’t see the screen half the time, and given I was mountain biking, it wasn’t like I could just touch the screen easily to see it again.\n\nInterestingly, after a bunch of rides and different configurations, I noticed:\n\n– Plain data field pages obviously burned the least battery, though, if they had any color blocks in them (e.g. zone changing color blacks), they *destroyed* battery life, even more than the map page. This was true even with just two data fields, if one was color (e.g. the wind page),\n\n– There was no meaningful difference in the number of sensors paired impacting battery life.\n\n– There was no obvious difference between having navigation enabled or not, battery life seemed to burn equally.\n\n– None of these figures include LiveTracking or Strava Live Segments, as both are unavailable at this time. Further, none of these figures included screen recording enabled.\n\n– As noted, by far, the biggest impact was which backlight time setting was enabled.\n\nNow, Wahoo says a secondary low-power saving backlight mode is coming in the first half of 2025. This mode will find a better balance between the backlight setting and battery burn. Though honestly, I’m not convinced that’s the issue. I think Wahoo needs to look more carefully at the rest of the code running and optimize there instead.\n\nThe reason I say that, is if we look at the Hammerhead Karoo 3 and Edge 1050, both of which have *FAR* more demanding screens (in terms of battery burn), both can outperform it, even in far brighter settings with far smaller batteries. And then if we look at similar screen technology types, like the Edge 1040, that too easily outperforms it on any setting you want.\n\nPoint is, I don’t really understand why the battery burn is as bad as it is, for as big a battery as Wahoo has. And while I say the term “bad” here despite the Hammerhead Karoo 3 being similar, keep in mind the Karoo is basically half the size, and far brighter.\n\nGPS & Elevation Accuracy:\n\nWhile this review hasn’t been packed with good news, fear not, this section delivers in that realm. The quick version is the GPS accuracy via the dual-frequency GPS chipset, as well as the elevation accuracy, is spot on.\n\nOf course, let’s get into the data. In this case, most of my data sets have at least three other devices running, thus making the full set:\n\nWahoo ELEMNT ACE\n\nGarmin Edge 1050\n\nHammerhead Karoo 3\n\nCOROS DURA\n\nI also had an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and an AmazFit T-Rex 3 on most rides to cross-validate if I needed, but didn’t bother pulling them into these data sets, simply to keep things a little less jumbled.\n\nFirst up, let’s look at a four-hour road ride into the mountains. Here’s the high-level overview, where things obviously look identical:\n\nAfter zooming in on the entire track, it’s basically perfect. Nonetheless, let’s look at some of the mountain switchback sections, just to demonstrate it.\n\nAbove, you can see a descent. The way you can tell is how ‘tight’ the tracks are (or, by knowing my direction of travel…). In this case, the tracks are slightly looser (above), then below, which is a descent. Still, in both cases, the tracks are all within the roadway of the map, and nobody is doing anything funky.\n\nHere’s another very tight switchback section, with complete 180* turns:\n\nOf course, GPS accuracy is only one part of the picture. This route had plenty of climbing on it, and all four units were quite close. I’d quibble that the COROS DURA’s altimeter seems the least accurate of the four in my testing, sometimes being a bit offset, but hardly by much.\n\nWhen it comes to sensor data, I had both a power meter and heart rate sensor connected to all computers, all to the same sensor. Thus, you’d want to see identical data across them. And sure enough, that’s the case. Below is the heart rate graph, merely because it’s a bit “prettier” (easier) data set to look at since heart rate is far more stable than power. Point is, I’m not seeing any data connectivity or capture issues.\n\nFinally, I rarely include ‘totals’ stats in my accuracy sections, because they can be easily misleading. A device can undershoot and overshoot corners and still end up with the same distance as an accurate device. Nonetheless, for fun, here’s the total distance and ascent highlighted here. The COROS Dura is slightly further out on distance than the others, but is in the mix for ascent.\n\nOk, let’s quickly look at another data set, this one a three-hour ride, partially near the sea (some interesting tidbits there on elevation in a second), and partially up into the mountains.\n\nHere on one of the tight switchback sections (ascending), you notice a little bit of variance from the Edge 1050. That makes sense, as I was trying to get some pretty shots of the ACE solo on the handlebars, so the Karoo 3 and Edge 1050 were on my top-tube, and the Edge 1050 was closest to my crotch (with my body blocking it). In case you’re curious, that very photo is the last photo in this review (for the summary section). In any case, despite that, all three were very close:\n\nAnd even in the straightaways, all were fine too (you’d be surprised how often GPS units screw-up straightaways).\n\nThat said, the elevation is actually super interesting. To begin, it’s perfectly fine by most definitions. That said, we notice a few things. The first arrow is alongside the sea/water on the dock. Thus the Edge 1050 is clearly the most correct at 2.4 meters. Whereas the Karoo and Wahoo are a bit high there. However, as I ascend all the units seem to consolidate. The second arrow is where we stopped at a grocery store for about 20 minutes. Notice the very slight altimeter drift there on the ACE. Only about 1-2 meters, but I thought it was geeky interesting.\n\nIn any event, nobody likely cares about 1-2 meters of elevation drift (and frankly, neither do I).\n\nSo instead, let’s look at one more data set, a mountain bike set. This is a blend of trees, some riding near cliffs, and some open terrain. Here’s the overall view:\n\nI wouldn’t say this is crazy challenging GPS terrain (my road rides were actually tougher), but nonetheless, MTB it is (though I have gravel biked this route, but it’s spicy rough).\n\nIn any case, let’s start off with this tree section at a high view. Things look good, right?\n\nBut here’s the kicker when you zoom in: This is actually a loop, with repeated passes (from different directions). Very solid.\n\nHere’s some higher-speed descent stuff (doubled back up too), without any issues:\n\nThe elevation is again fodder for geeks. Those three arrows? It’s when I went down to the beach. I didn’t wheel dip, but was up on the shore at about 2m in altitude. You can see the ACE presents it as much higher at 5m in altitude. Not a huge deal there, though, the 15m offset on one of the climbs is surprising. Albeit, by the second climb, it is perfectly aligned.\n\nIn this case, my geekery aside, overall GPS and elevation on much longer/bigger/complex routes looks very solid. Zero issues there, and the same goes for data sensor connectivity, where I haven’t had any drops or connection issues once paired with sensors.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nCyclists kept asking Wahoo to make a bike computer with a better and bigger display, and on that specific point, they checked the box. In fact, I’ll even agree that their new home screen/dashboard is better than before. And that their map styling pages are very solid. And yes, the bike bell is awesome. Seriously, that’s (by far) the best feature on this unit.\n\nBut in almost every other category, Wahoo simply launched this device too early, and at too high of a price relative to their competitors or the capabilities the ACE has today. It lacks significant features and integrations seen on the Wahoo ROAM V2 or BOLT V2 (their current bike computers), and falls far short of the claimed 30 hours of battery life in my testing. And that’s before we talk about the screen visibility, or the value of the aero sensor. I just don’t understand why Wahoo keeps launching bike computers too early each time, while they stick the landing perfectly on trainer launches most times. There was zero reason to launch this in early December, versus waiting till next March.\n\nIn fact, it seems to be an industry trend this year. We saw the COROS Dura launch far too early, so much so the company then had to repeatedly delay shipping for both hardware and software reasons. We’ve seen startups JESPR and Absolute One also launch at both crazy-high prices and with the feature sets of a 2012 bike computer. Still, Hammerhead did launch their Karoo 3 this past spring to appropriate pricing, finished features with most of the polish required, and solid accuracy. And Garmin also launched their Edge 1050 this past summer at the same price as their previous top-end device, with virtually no complaints from reviewers or consumers alike.\n\nThe problem is, launching unbaked early gets you reviews like this. Reviews that live for *years* on the internet. Sure, perhaps I’ll update it as Wahoo improves in future firmware, but that won’t change the YouTube video, which can’t be updated. And sure, I could publish another YouTube video down the road each month they restore new features, but reviews months later rarely top the charts in consumer searches.\n\nI want companies like Wahoo or COROS to challenge the growing bike computer monopoly. I think both have significant unique things to offer there. In the case of COROS, it’s crazy battery life and extremely good pricing. In the case of Wahoo it tends to be simplicity and ease of use. But launching half-baked products like this only damages their reputation, furthering their competitors’ position.\n\nSigh.\n\nWith that, thanks for reading (or supporting independent reviews like this)!"
