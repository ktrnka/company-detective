      "# [98point6 Technologies on 2024-03-08](https://www.98point6.com/platform/)\nAsynchronous care, or “async,” is a type of virtual care with no scheduling requirements, giving the patient the flexibility and convenience to seek care for non-urgent concerns whenever and wherever they’d like. Whereas a response from a provider may occur quickly, there is no real-time interaction between the patient and the medical staff. This type of dedicated care also helps with capturing revenue by incorporating patient messages from a provider’s inbox back into the patient chart to enhance the continuity of care. 98point6 can support your clinicians in asynchronously diagnosing and treating more than 140 common conditions for patients across all ages—from pediatrics to geriatrics.\n\nOur AI-powered solution leverages evidence-based clinical content, machine learning, and automation to recommend the optimal care option, while also giving patients the ability to choose the format they prefer. Customizable to the specific workflow of the healthcare organization, the clinician can direct the patient to real-time care or prompt them to seek in-person care if their medical concern cannot be treated asynchronously.\n\nReal-time virtual care can consist of text-based messaging, audio, or video interactions, or any combination of the three. Additionally, real-time care can be facilitated as an on-demand or scheduled visit. On-demand visits allow patients to immediately start a visit, any time, from anywhere. Patients can report symptoms and concerns and our product gathers relevant history, before connecting the patient to a clinician. Wait times in the queue are dependent on clinician availability. Scheduled visits allow patients to choose a date and time in the future that is most convenient for them.\n\nOur patient intake automates much of the administrative tasks associated with taking a history. Our product is trained, based on millions of patient encounters, to respond to patient-reported symptoms with question sets, written by physicians, that elicit relevant clinical details for provider review. It works like this: the patient enters their chief complaint as free text. They can write as much or as little as they want to communicate the reason for their visit and their symptoms. The 98point6 platform intakes all of that information and then generates the appropriate follow-up questions.\n\nOur patient intake process significantly reduces the administrative burden on clinicians – and automatically captures an accurate transcript of patient-reported symptoms.\n\nWe have been applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to medical encounters since 2015. As a result, we have a vast data set that is one-of-a-kind in the field of natural language processing for medical applications. We utilize Al and machine learning to improve both efficiency and medical quality by automating time-consuming tasks, allowing clinicians to focus their judgment on key decision points in the clinical encounter. Our system provides information and actions for the clinician to consider; however, the clinician is in complete control of the visit diagnosis, and care planning.\n\nData integration is cornerstone to the 98point6 platform. EMR data can be automatically pulled into the clinician console, and once the visit is complete, data is automatically sent to the EMR to be recorded in the patient’s medical record. Our standards-based integration supports Epic and Cerner, as well as other EMRs. The platform also supports data integrations for analytics, reporting, security and compliance and other administrative needs.",

      "# [Press Release on 2023-03-06](https://www.98point6.com/press_release/98point6-press-release_03062023/)\nVirtual Care Pioneer Intends to Become 98point6 Technologies Delivering the Digital Infrastructure Third-Party Health Systems Need to Capture More Revenue\n\nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON - March 6, 2023 - 98point6 today announced its plan to relaunch as licensed software provider, 98point6 Technologies, on the heels of the intended sale of its multi-million dollar Care Delivery division to health and care experience company, Transcarent. As part of the deal, hundreds of 98point6 enterprise customers including Boeing, Kindercare and Banner|Aetna employing millions of eligible members will have access to an even wider selection of primary and behavioral health services through Transcarent. The newly emerged 98point6 Technologies plans to remain solely focused on licensing its software to third-party health care providers such as MultiCare Health System, the first to license the 98point6 Technology Platform within its hybrid ambulatory care platform, Indigo Health.\n\n“Our evolution to 98point6 Technologies answers the need for purpose-built technology created by physicians, for physicians, and is the culmination of work our front-line team of clinicians spent years perfecting,” said Jay Burrell, President and Chief Executive Officer of 98point6 Technologies. “This comes at a time when every provider in the health services industry is on an urgent mission to remain competitive in what has become an increasingly crowded and undifferentiated marketplace.”\n\nIn today’s market, demand for telehealth services has stabilized at 38 times higher than pre-pandemic levels and healthcare providers are scrambling to catch up, citing telehealth implementation as a top challenge. According to new research only 13% of hospitals and health systems consider themselves ahead of the pace of change that patients expect and new market rivals are setting, and only 11% of health systems report being in the implementation phase of their personalized care and digital transformation journeys.\n\nHealth systems recognize they must move quickly to solidify their brand presence and physical footprint, starting with the expansion of their ambulatory care business and introduction of new technology and consumer-centered services. Gartner’s Hype Cycle for Healthcare Providers, 2022 corroborated the shift, stating “we see greater provider interest and focus on virtual care and total experience to meet clinical and business demands.”\n\nTechnology Built to Give Health Care Providers a Competitive Edge\n\nThe 98point6 Technology Platform provides a turn-key, cloud-based solution for scaling up a virtual care operation complete with software, professional services and support from a team who built and operated a successful, nationwide virtual clinic for the past several years. The platform provides a quick and cost effective way to create new revenue opportunities, better support the workforce, improve care and boost the bottom line. Implementation includes a client-branded app and assistance in configuring the platform.\n\n“Our strategic partnership with 98point6 will help us scale our digital capabilities to meet community demand and bring a new level of meaningful engagement to our customers,” said Ryan Fix, President of Retail Health at MultiCare.\n\nAt the heart of the 98point6 Technology Platform is a web-based Clinician Console, which encapsulates a refined set of best practices designed to help providers deliver high quality virtual care based on years of clinical experience. Built-in logic in the form of artificial intelligence (AI) and automated practice standards guide providers to quickly make the right medical decisions or recommend in-person care when needed. This level of automation limits care variability, optimizes patient time by streamlining the intake process and reduces cognitive load on the provider to support top-of-licensure practice.\n\nThe 98point6 Technology Platform includes:\n\nA standalone digital clinic hosted in the cloud, including AI-powered patient engagement, workflow and EHR integration, care follow-up and documentation.\n\nWeb-based Clinician Console for providers to conduct visits.\n\nAn SDK to create a fully-branded patient experience.\n\nTraining and development for clinicians and staff.\n\nEngagement marketing support to activate new users and drive utilization.\n\nWorkforce management guidance to help define hybrid staffing and scheduling plans.\n\nFor more information on 98point6 Technologies, visit 98point6.com.\n\nAbout 98point6 Technologies\n\n98point6 Technologies builds and licenses software to power exceptional virtual care experiences for providers and patients based on years of clinical use across millions of patients.

By enabling healthcare organizations to license this additional model of care delivery, 98point6 once again sets the bar with an integrated, purpose-built clinician solution that future-proofs virtual clinic operations. In related news, the company announced it has doubled-down on its growth strategy, acquiring the remaining assets of Bright.md following the sale of its technology to Evernorth, and continuing to service long-time customers Baptist Health, UAB Medicine and 14 others.\n\nThe Balancing Act: Addressing Clinician Burnout and Patient Preferences\n\nClinician burnout is rampant, with over 45% of healthcare workers feeling burnout often or very often.

      "# [The Doctor Will See You Right Now: 98point6 Introduces On-Demand Primary Care with Digital Platform Launch on 2018-05-01](https://www.98point6.com/press_release/the-doctor-will-see-you-right-now/)\n98point6 combines AI with board-certified physicians to provide primary care anytime, anywhere\n\nSEATTLE – May 1, 2018 – 98point6 today announced the launch of its on-demand primary care service to deliver personalized consultation, diagnosis and treatment to patients across the country. The service enables primary care beyond what’s ever been possible, combining innovative AI technology with board-certified physicians to deliver affordable and high-quality care right to a patient’s smartphone. 98point6 physicians are currently seeing patients in 10 states: California, Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington. 98point6 will roll out the service to patients in all 50 states and Washington D.C. by the end of 2018, reinventing primary care coast to coast.\n\nPrimary care is a necessity for all, serving as the front line for healthcare and disease prevention. However, seeing a doctor is increasingly difficult with an average wait time of 24 days just for an appointment. Coupled with rising medical costs, patients are left wondering whether they need the treatment enough to warrant the time and cost. These factors have led to patient disengagement, with more than 21 percent of adults not having a primary care physician, and are the driving forces behind 98point6 – for all the times you want to see a physician but can’t.\n\nTo provide patients primary care anywhere and anytime, 98point6 leverages machine learning and automation, helping doctors optimize and complete tasks that don’t require direct physician interaction, such as the initial gathering of information. Rather than having doctors ask administrative questions, gather patient history or chart information, 98point6’s AI technology does it for them. Patient profiles are automatically built and the 98point6 system learns from each visit, avoiding redundancy.\n\nFrom there, 98point6 board-certified physicians take over and engage with the patient via private and secure in-app messaging to diagnose, treat and answer any health-related questions, no matter how large, small, or embarrassing. Patients will then receive a personalized care plan detailing their diagnosis and treatment, including prescriptions and labs as needed.\n\n“There are far too many people that aren’t getting the primary care they need, and that’s a problem. Our mission is to make primary care accessible and affordable, inspiring early and frequent use, leading to better overall health and material cost of care savings,” said Robbie Cape, CEO and co-founder of 98point6. “The ubiquity of smartphones, combined with consumer expectations for simple, life-changing solutions underscores the opportunity for on-demand care. 98point6 meets consumers where they are through private, text-based primary care that’s available when and where they need it.”\n\nNow, anyone 18 years and older – whether they have health insurance or not – can download the 98point6 app and receive unlimited access to primary care for 12 months for a one-time introductory fee of $20. That’s a full year of primary care services for less than the cost of a typical copay.\n\nFor employers, 98point6 increases primary care utilization among those not actively or appropriately engaged in their healthcare. Employees can now access primary care in between meetings, during their commute or while getting ready in the morning. And similar to the consumer pricing model, 98point6 offers a low subscription fee for employers, resulting in little to no cost for employees while enabling earlier medical intervention and reducing overall cost of care.\n\nOne of the country’s preeminent children’s hospitals, Seattle Children’s, recently became a 98point6 customer and will roll out the service to their employees later this month.\n\n“Seattle Children’s is committed to providing top quality care to those in need, and that includes the health and well-being of our highly valued team members,” said Myra Gregorian, Senior Vice President and Chief People Officer at Seattle Children’s. “98point6’s solution allows us to provide an additional layer of care that complements current healthcare plans and fits within our team’s busy lifestyle.”\n\nTo begin using 98point6, download the app from the Apple App Store or Google Play, create a secure account, and the doctor will see you right now.\n\nFor additional information, please visit www.98point6.com.\n\nAbout 98point6"

Just wait it out.” I get that some Doctors just hand out prescriptions to everyone and they certainly don’t want to be the online pharmacy, but with the warning before you even meet the Dr you get a sense they’ll take your insurance company’s money, but not any risk to actually treat someone.\n\nThe advantage to the Doctors is that they never get a personal review because the Doctor who will diagnose you will be chosen by the app.\n\nAnyway if you want a Doctor’s sympathy this is the app for you.",

I told the doctor my issue and asked if it were possible for a script (nothing with painkillers or anything they aren’t allowed to prescribe), to which the doctor essentially ignored me and recommended things I have been doing to no avail throughout being sick. I informed the doctor that his advice was not something that was working, however I would give one of his solutions a try (it was clear he had no interest in helping me, as my primary care would have) and wrapped up the conversation asap.

If she had taken the time to speak with me over the zoom, she could have ascertained that I do in fact have a bacterial infection. Instead, she texted a very general, “one size fits all” recommendation. I think it’s a waste of money for business to use this service for their employees. Their doctor told me I had to be sick for at least 10 days for her to consider antibiotics. Update 2, woke up with severe conjunctivitis in my left eye.  I was unable to open it because of hardened puss - a sign of a bacterial infection according to CDC.",

I used the app for the first time today, answered the pre-“visit” questions (not bad there), and then when my virtual doctor joined, it was more or less the doctor messaging the entire time, not letting me really get a word in, and trying to push things on me without me getting to tell him what I was looking for as an end result. I told the doctor my issue and asked if it were possible for a script (nothing with painkillers or anything they aren’t allowed to prescribe), to which the doctor essentially ignored me and recommended things I have been doing to no avail throughout being sick. I informed the doctor that his advice was not something that was working, however I would give one of his solutions a try (it was clear he had no interest in helping me, as my primary care would have) and wrapped up the conversation asap.

      "# Post ID bg7ip2: Internet medicine is awesome, 98point6 was so so helpful for me with +55 score by [(FrugalChef13, Reddit, 2019-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/)\n**TL;DR- $20 got me an awesome appointment with a nice doctor and a prescription for a medication I could afford that solved my issue.**\n\n*Disclaimer: This particular thing worked well for me so I'm going to tell you about it. Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I'm not compensated or connected to the website I'm discussing.*\n\nSo like a lot of people on here I'm usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it's underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I've got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I'd run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn't been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn't, it's weird.\n\nSo I was fucked.  Can't sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can't afford the $100+ for a doctor's appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there's a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\n\nSo I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It's $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I'm drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I'm still in bad shape tomorrow morning it's worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\n\nGuys, it was amazing.  It's not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I'd already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn't help.  She was so kind, and didn't make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor's appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it's faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can't prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I'd taken in the past wasn't an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What's the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\n\nUsually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it's what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you'll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can't estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\n\nThis amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I'll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn't shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that's a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\n\nI would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It's not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it's a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\n\nIf anyone else has recommendations or critiques or thoughts on internet medicine stuff I'd love to hear it.\n\n## Comment ID elj1h0o with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/elj1h0o/) (in reply to ID bg7ip2):\nThat sounds like a great resource!

Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.\n\nA prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\n\nControlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\n\nSo the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.  Neither medication can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor, but Vicodin is super extra hard to get prescribed.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nEDIT: I tried to clarify the original post to make it more obvious that although she couldn't prescribe the thing I'd taken in the past, she did prescribe a thing that helped a lot.  It actually helped even more than the thing I'd taken in the past and without making me drowsy, which is AWESOME!\n\n#### Comment ID elkh6df with +3 score by [(Mr_Fuzzo, Reddit, 2019-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/elkh6df/) (in reply to ID eljx9uw):\nControlled substances, for the un-initiated are medications like opiates, barbiturates, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, etc.\n\nSo, meds like Xanax, OxyContin, Ritalin, etc.\n\n#### Comment ID eljy54o with +2 score by [(AnotherDay_RS, Reddit, 2019-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/eljy54o/) (in reply to ID eljx9uw):\nThat's great!!

I also called a steward to verify what y’all said about the note so I can cover my ass. I’ll be sure to let my colleagues know that the sick slip is only if u have no hours to cover it:\n\nAnd to the small handful of weirdos in the comments. I’m not risking a wreck driving in while I’m puking my guts out. If I was healthy enough to drive I woulda gone in. I’ve always wanted to work for Boeing since I was a kid, as my childhood dream, and I still don’t boot lick as bad as y’all. \n\n## Comment ID lf0tolo with +10 score by [(Jayden_Ebi, Reddit, 2024-07-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/boeing/comments/1ecm7g6/calling_sick/lf0tolo/) (in reply to ID 1ecm7g6):\nYou don't need a doctor's note to use your sick leave. just call the hotline and put in 8 hours of sick leave in your ETS the next day\n\n## Comment ID lf19kr0 with +11 score by [(PlayfulOtterFriend, Reddit, 2024-07-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/boeing/comments/1ecm7g6/calling_sick/lf19kr0/) (in reply to ID 1ecm7g6):\nI know Boeing is big with several different attendance policies, which range by region, division, job role, and union status.

You probably want a General Practitioner or Family Doctor, to start with.\n\nHave you ever gone to a dentist?

I don’t have to rent cars often but the process is so stinking simple with Costco. It was also a minimum of 10 dollars cheaper than I could find anywhere else, usually more, and it was free to reserve. Plus the free additional driver. This was one of the only things about one of my recent trips that went exactly as planned with no complications along the way.\n\n#### Comment ID i5h743x with +10 score by [(didyouseemynipple, Reddit, 2022-04-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/u7mkpr/most_underrated_costco_benefit/i5h743x/) (in reply to ID i5g414h):\nThanks for this - I never rent elsewhere again\n\n#### Comment ID i5hkuv8 with +2 score by [(nicoco2211, Reddit, 2022-04-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/u7mkpr/most_underrated_costco_benefit/i5hkuv8/) (in reply to ID i5g414h):\nInteresting that you’re finding it to be cheaper.

Just the extra driver for free can save you a bundle.\n\n### Comment ID i5gjtw2 with +43 score by [(alexdelicious, Reddit, 2022-04-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/u7mkpr/most_underrated_costco_benefit/i5gjtw2/) (in reply to ID i5fqp30):\nJust returned a rental in Maui, where everything is super expensive, this morning.

I currently use National as I have the AMEX Executive deal and just pick a car and go, but the prices on Costco Travel are decently cheaper.

Words can’t describe how much I hate that stupid company. I’d recommend calling your primary care provider and explaining the situation. Most of the time they can write it as long as you can show a diagnosis and proof you’ve taken it before. \n\nThat’ll also protect you from losing your prescription when the pandemic exemption eventually expires— it’s a general rule for controlled substances that you need at least one in-person meeting with the doctor before they can fill it. I think some places don’t require this, but AFAIK it was a requirement pre-2020. I know they did also always require the person who prescribed it to be in-state back then as well. \n\nAt least they stopped requiring you to physically deliver HANDWRITTEN prescriptions. That was the stupidest thing. You’d normally get 3 at a time, and if you lost one for the month? Sucks to suck. Can’t think of a less adhd-friendly system. I think that changed 2018-ish?

I love the simplicity and often lower cost of telehealth, but I honestly wonder if they ever decline to give out a prescription. If you want Adderall, you just pay the online provider and get a script. There are even telehealth services for testosterone replacement therapy prescribing 200mg of testosterone to 19 year old kids who basically want legal anabolic steroids. I've seen guys with testosterone levels of 800pg/dL getting TRT scripts for quadruple the normal dosage. While some providers may be acting responsibly, there are countless services that are not.\n\nAdderall works great for a lot of people, there are plenty of people that depend on it. It is also a dangerous stimulant that is wickedly over-prescribed. I can understand the pharmacy having hesitations about this. In the not-so-distant past, it was opioids being handed out like candy.

Basically pill mills started up, and doctors at them would write scripts for millions of pills for \"patients\" all over the country that they could never have possibly seen. So as a response Walgreens (and CVS, I believe), the two largest pharmacy chains in the US, have instituted a policy that if you are presenting a new script, the prescriber is not local, and you've not been on the medication before, the pharmacist can, and usually will require that they speak to the doctor to confirm the script, dosage, and DX before dispensing the drug. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get telehealth can be a good thing, but for psychoactive medication that can be abused like stimulants, I think what Walgreens and CVS are doing is a reasonable control mechanism on  MDs/DOs/PAs/APNs just writing scripts like crazy.\n\n#### Comment ID isvvl0w with +6 score by [(Tragically_Fantastic, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/isvvl0w/) (in reply to ID isve0mi):\nI do think it's an ok policy, but basically what this pharmacist said was if they can get in touch with my prescriber, they'll fill it one time, but after that they won't do it again, which feels kinda backwards to me?

I have not had one ounce of ill will or trouble from anyone at Mayo, and I can just go to their pharmacy and get my Rx filled. The worst part is waiting between appointments... The journey from initial consult to CBT appointments and then confirmation with a psych eval and prescribing meds took about a year, not because they were unsure, but because the calendars were (and remain) pretty well booked up. Side note: I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder (recurrent), and that's why I had CBT appointments mixed in there. They had to rule out anxiety before ADHD, but the doc smartly suggested the ADHD was leading to my anxiety, so he is treating the ADHD first.

I promise we aren’t trying to make life miserable for you. I have adhd too. We have a duty to fill a prescription “in good faith” - I can lose my license otherwise. Example: There are 2 providers from telehealth that I see hundreds and hundreds of Adderall rx from - from their FL, CO, and CA office. I do not see them prescribe *anything* except Adderall. At all. That is a massive red flag for me. They have also (confirmed) never met with any of their patients in person. Another red flag. \n\nI can also understand that seeing a doctor in person is difficult for some people and their schedules- I have to schedule an appt once every 3 months in person myself and it is very difficult with my unpredictable schedule. Bottom line is our license and livelihood is on the line. I think of telehealth as a non-permanent solution while establishing a provider in your community.\n\nLastly, with so many rx now coming from telehealth we are hitting our max of many stimulants that we can order from the DEA on a monthly basis. I cannot take care of our current clientele with the massive influx - we already hit our DEA limit as it is. I usually suggest folks try another pharmacy in a more suburban area (we are urban and Adderall-sense) so you don’t have to go weeks without your medication. \n\nAlso as some others have mentioned, C2s cannot be transferred so you will need to have your prescriber send in a new rx to the pharmacy at which you want to have it filled. \n\nWe’re also extremely understaffed which complicates everything. Please be nice to us. It is hell on earth at most pharmacies right now. \n\n**I would suggest doing mail order pharmacy to get your med (Amazon has a pharmacy) or any independent pharmacy in your area.** I hope this helps clarify some misunderstandings.\n\n### Comment ID isyt1l9 with +2 score by [(Tragically_Fantastic, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/isyt1l9/) (in reply to ID isyqlmt):\nYeah, I understand that.

It used to be sooo easy with my psychiatrist. Dr. Awesome would prescribe my meds for 90 days. So I would call her once every 3 months and l would... get this... only have to leave her a message. All her phone calls went directly to voice mail. And if I left her with my name, meds refilled and phone number to reach me I would get a notification 1 hour later that she sent my script in. I would see her in person every six months as a general check up. So fucking easy. \n\nBut she retired... now i go to my practioner because I'm fucking stable! (Honestly super proud of that accomplishment) however, this new doctor can't prescribe them for 90 days only 30. So every month I have to remember to call their office. Explain to the person on the phone what I need. That yes I have two meds with the same name. I've been through this routine so many times I can pronounce dexemethlyfenidate. She passes it along to the doctor. Doctor approves it and after two days if the pharmacy doesn't call me I have to call them to make sure it got pushed through. Wait another day. Now it takes them a week or so to figure out billing me. By the time they do bill me I forget about it and it ends up getting close to being over due. I pay the bill.

I wonder if its a blessing in disguise for some people. Guys if you are going through this, do not let it stress you. This is what I did, now be prepared because it is going to sound cheesy because I am a very cheesy person... When Walgreens made me wait 3 weeks for my newly prescribed telehealth Adderall 10mgs during the last few weeks of school (including finals), it made me feel like... worse than poop. I will admit when I got the RX, I had the most surreal sense of calm and peace. Like finally my war was over and I could be treated like a normal person. I didn't have to seek illegal alternatives anymore and feel like a criminal. I could finally get help for my issues and my life was about to improve dramatically. Then doubt crept in, I am not worth this RX, I am not worth getting better, I am a criminal, I am a bad person. I do not deserve to be high functioning like my friends and family. I deserve to live the life I am living. (Obviously have self-esteem issues) With all this thinking floating around in my head, I called Walgreens to see if they ahd received my medication, and this started the whole awkward \"Oh, the medication is on back-order and we do not know when it will be in.\" If a pharmacy wants to fill your RX, the alternative to this wil be \"Oh, your medication is not in stock but go ahead and get your RX sent in so we can get it in stock ASAP.\" There is no such thing as just telling a patient who has been prescribed a medication by a licensed physician that their medication is just not available with no explanation. I did not know this though. It took me weeks to learn this. I thought the medication was really out of stock! It took calling other pharmacies and hearing the condescending tone in their nvoice that made me realize this was a catch all resposne to telehealth prescriptions. They even started denying the other script that I had been getting for over 5 years through telehealth! (Suboxone - huge deal to be cut off).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was so down in the dumps. Then I was taught a new method of thinking by a person I look up to. I started ending all the negative shit. I started saying positive stuff to myself to build myself up... \"You are a pre-med student and will get any treatment you need for any illness you are diagnosed with.\" I looked on reddit for pharmacies that other students of UCF were using and not having trouble getting their rX'S filled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI basically changed up my thinking and if I got a negative response from a pharmacy (I did, a few times...) I simply acted confused (Because deep down I was anyways)... If someone treats you in a way you know for a fact you do not deserve, do not get upset back at them, do not get upset period... It is okay to show confusion, which is justified. Acting confused changed up the dynamics so much that a few pharmacy techs even explained to me what was actually going on, Walgreens had decided to implement a policy where the prescribing doctor had to be within a 30 mile radius of the patient and had seen the patient in the last year. Other pharmacies were following their lead. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a good person. I do however have ADHD. I deserve treatment. I deserve to be treated with respect. Trust me, okay, there is a way to get your RX filled. It may not be through Walgreens, but there is a way if you keep up your spirits and be true to what you deserve. Do not use this as an excuse to get frustrated and head back to the streets for illegal adderall. Fight for your own prescription!!!!  \n\n\nI ended up getting mine filled at a Costco, a pharamcy which has been deemed to be problematic for telehealth prescriptions. However I did not have one single problem with them and they treated me like a decent human being.

Even when I got my supplement prescription, I take a 10 mg extended release once per day and also I'm prescribed a 10 mg instant release once per day, when they added that instant release they were really cool about it too, they even helped reach out to my insurance company to get it covered.",

But you gotta go in the AtoZ and resign so it shows up in the system that you no longer work there. don’t just stop going to work because you will still show as an employee for awhile"

Every time I have attempted to seek treatment for extremely basic/common urgent care illnesses i have ended up having to seek treatment from another company/provider bc the 98point6 providers have refused to actually listen to me or I have been sent for unnecessary laboratory tests that take days to come back and refuse to actually meanwhile I was suffering from a bladder infection that became a kidney infection while waiting for a lab test to tell the provider that it’s okay to give antibiotics!!! I was told to go to the ER for PINK eye and I $$$  for another telehealth provider whom immediately recognized the acute illness provided the proper treatment and I made a full recovery but lost more $$! Every time you  access the app to seek medical treatment the providers will classify every illness you have been treated for in the past as a “chronic” condition and will refuse to treat you and tell you to go seek a health care provider!! Lol I mean I thought that was what I was doing but I guess not! It’s just a waste of time and $$ and you will never be bc able to get a refund on your subscription plan that doesn’t actually exist bc the providers only care about making their $$",

I have had strep throat and sent pictures in and the provider argued with me that it was not strep and I wouldn’t know and told me to see someone in person. Of course it was.

I told the doctor my issue and asked if it were possible for a script (nothing with painkillers or anything they aren’t allowed to prescribe), to which the doctor essentially ignored me and recommended things I have been doing to no avail throughout being sick. I informed the doctor that his advice was not something that was working, however I would give one of his solutions a try (it was clear he had no interest in helping me, as my primary care would have) and wrapped up the conversation asap. Again, I like the concept of this app; I think it’s a great idea…just not so much the staff that partners with the app. It all felt impersonal and like a quick cash grab.",

I understand some people abuse antibiotics- but this doctor didn’t even talk to me other than to verify my name and birthday. If she had taken the time to speak with me over the zoom, she could have ascertained that I do in fact have a bacterial infection. Instead, she texted a very general, “one size fits all” recommendation. I think it’s a waste of money for business to use this service for their employees. Their doctor told me I had to be sick for at least 10 days for her to consider antibiotics. Update 2, woke up with severe conjunctivitis in my left eye.  I was unable to open it because of hardened puss - a sign of a bacterial infection according to CDC.",

Then there were layoffs and more employees at all levels left on their own. Goals have not changed. More have been added and all dead lines were kept the same. Of course when these deadlines are not met the next company meeting is negative with a lot of general blaming and saying we all just need to work harder. Communication overall has been terrible with \"we don't know yet\" being the usual answer for any concerns. Weeks without answers. Any answers are just as rushed and poorly thought out as the changes. This toxic attitude is starting with the top level but you can see it affecting teams as they feel more pressure.",

In other words don’t just reply to Glassdoor reviews promising you’ll change but then doing the same thing. Let’s see some action. \r\n\r\n2. Implement change management best practices. Try to anticipate, listen to, and address concerns from employees about the upcoming changes. Allow people adequate time to process a change. Even when you’ve had time to process the change, remember that the news is still fresh for others and they may need more time to process and talk through concerns. Multiple events over the past few years had indicated that change management is not a strength that we have internally, so maybe it’s time to bring in some consultants who could assist with this culture shift.\r\n\r\n3. Prioritize your people. It hurts me to see how many people have had negative experiences at 98point6 and who have left since they felt they could not develop there or continue to succeed in such a psychologically unsafe culture. Sacrificing people to meet your financial goals will not work due to the expense of that turnover. Prioritize your people and the rest of the goals will follow.",

          "cons": "It’s taken a few months of reflection for me to process my experience at 98point6 since leaving and be able to summarize the numerous red flags into this one review. If you are considering a job there, please be aware that you are entering a culture that is extremely toxic to individual contributors. While 98point6 has a neat mission and some great people, it has some major cons that I’ve attempted to summarize below: \r\n\r\n1. Lack of Change Management\r\nAnnounces major leadership changes right before holiday weekends, when many are out of office. When they host AMAs, the leadership is defensive and not open to discourse. Little is done to support the employees struggling with the effects of the change.\r\n\r\n2. Minimal Development of Talent\r\nThere is a very slow performance review structure which is annual and takes ~3 months to complete. Even for a start-up they pay well below the market value, and the salary increases are minimal with little to no role/title development. This was particularly noticeable for those in coordinator roles.\r\n\r\n3. Incompetent Support for Employees\r\nThe COO does not have the competencies to direct the People Team to adequately support employees at this toxic company. When my team aimed to take the correct route and pull in the People Team for support, the People Team’s response was extremely slow and resulted in a solution that did more harm than good. I have heard similarly from many others in different departments, and other Glassdoor reviewers have reported this as well. \r\n\r\n4. Lack of Accountability for Management\r\nAt many times I heard comments from people managers that were sexist, racist, and downright disrespectful to others at the company. There is little accountability for those in management or leadership roles. The combination of this with an incompetent People Team results in a culture that is victim-blaming and generally unhealthy for individual contributors.\r\n\r\n5. Financial Instability Results in Deprioritzation of Employees\r\nTo meet our financial goals as a start up, the company implemented many measures which may have been financially wise but were extremely detrimental to employees. For example, in 2021 they entered a 6+ month hiring freeze which meant that even when a team lost multiple people they would not re-staff and instead would expect remaining team members to take on that work with no change in title or salary. Note that 98point6 refuses to make title or salary changes outside of the annual performance review even when this type of drastic change occurs. This has resulted in very high turnover (even when taking into account the “great resignation”) from those burnt out employees.\r\n\r\nTo summarize my experience at 98point6…Did I expand the scope of my role, take on new responsibilities, and learn new skills in the process? Absolutely! That’s what helped me land my next job.\r\n\r\nDid I receive any promotion, increase in formal recognition, other rewards or support at 98point6 as a result of my new responsibilities? Not at all. That’s what drove me to the realization that if I didn’t want my career trajectory to plateau I would need to pursue a job elsewhere.",

I sincerely enjoy the company of the people who work here.\n\nA lot of companies have a list of core values that employees can rattle off, but rarely do you see them weave the core values into everything they do. 98point6 really does weave their core values into all of their work, from the interview process to our day-to-day interactions.\n\nThe company adapted well to remote work during the pandemic, and is being very thoughtful about how we adapt and cater to all employees as we move to a hybrid environment.\n\nRelentless Improvement is a core value that I've seen the company take seriously. I've seen leadership act on feedback given by employees, and continual improvements made in policies and processes, such as our interview process. Leadership and the company doesn't get things right 100% of the time, but they are passionate about making improvements when opportunities arise and when we are put in situations where the company needs to adapt.",

I sincerely enjoy the company of the people who work here.\n\nA lot of companies have a list of core values that employees can rattle off, but rarely do you see them weave the core values into everything they do. 98point6 really does weave their core values into all of their work, from the interview process to our day-to-day interactions.\n\nThe company adapted well to remote work during the pandemic, and is being very thoughtful about how we adapt and cater to all employees as we move to a hybrid environment.\n\nRelentless Improvement is a core value that I've seen the company take seriously. I've seen leadership act on feedback given by employees, and continual improvements made in policies and processes, such as our interview process. Leadership and the company doesn't get things right 100% of the time, but they are passionate about making improvements when opportunities arise and when we are put in situations where the company needs to adapt.",

In other words don’t just reply to Glassdoor reviews promising you’ll change but then doing the same thing. Let’s see some action. \r\n\r\n2. Implement change management best practices. Try to anticipate, listen to, and address concerns from employees about the upcoming changes. Allow people adequate time to process a change. Even when you’ve had time to process the change, remember that the news is still fresh for others and they may need more time to process and talk through concerns. Multiple events over the past few years had indicated that change management is not a strength that we have internally, so maybe it’s time to bring in some consultants who could assist with this culture shift.\r\n\r\n3. Prioritize your people. It hurts me to see how many people have had negative experiences at 98point6 and who have left since they felt they could not develop there or continue to succeed in such a psychologically unsafe culture. Sacrificing people to meet your financial goals will not work due to the expense of that turnover. Prioritize your people and the rest of the goals will follow.",
        "cons": "It’s taken a few months of reflection for me to process my experience at 98point6 since leaving and be able to summarize the numerous red flags into this one review. If you are considering a job there, please be aware that you are entering a culture that is extremely toxic to individual contributors. While 98point6 has a neat mission and some great people, it has some major cons that I’ve attempted to summarize below: \r\n\r\n1. Lack of Change Management\r\nAnnounces major leadership changes right before holiday weekends, when many are out of office. When they host AMAs, the leadership is defensive and not open to discourse. Little is done to support the employees struggling with the effects of the change.\r\n\r\n2. Minimal Development of Talent\r\nThere is a very slow performance review structure which is annual and takes ~3 months to complete. Even for a start-up they pay well below the market value, and the salary increases are minimal with little to no role/title development. This was particularly noticeable for those in coordinator roles.\r\n\r\n3. Incompetent Support for Employees\r\nThe COO does not have the competencies to direct the People Team to adequately support employees at this toxic company. When my team aimed to take the correct route and pull in the People Team for support, the People Team’s response was extremely slow and resulted in a solution that did more harm than good. I have heard similarly from many others in different departments, and other Glassdoor reviewers have reported this as well. \r\n\r\n4. Lack of Accountability for Management\r\nAt many times I heard comments from people managers that were sexist, racist, and downright disrespectful to others at the company. There is little accountability for those in management or leadership roles. The combination of this with an incompetent People Team results in a culture that is victim-blaming and generally unhealthy for individual contributors.\r\n\r\n5. Financial Instability Results in Deprioritzation of Employees\r\nTo meet our financial goals as a start up, the company implemented many measures which may have been financially wise but were extremely detrimental to employees. For example, in 2021 they entered a 6+ month hiring freeze which meant that even when a team lost multiple people they would not re-staff and instead would expect remaining team members to take on that work with no change in title or salary. Note that 98point6 refuses to make title or salary changes outside of the annual performance review even when this type of drastic change occurs. This has resulted in very high turnover (even when taking into account the “great resignation”) from those burnt out employees.\r\n\r\nTo summarize my experience at 98point6…Did I expand the scope of my role, take on new responsibilities, and learn new skills in the process? Absolutely! That’s what helped me land my next job.\r\n\r\nDid I receive any promotion, increase in formal recognition, other rewards or support at 98point6 as a result of my new responsibilities? Not at all. That’s what drove me to the realization that if I didn’t want my career trajectory to plateau I would need to pursue a job elsewhere.",

By enabling healthcare organizations to license this additional model of care delivery, 98point6 once again sets the bar with an integrated, purpose-built clinician solution that future-proofs virtual clinic operations. In related news, the company announced it has doubled-down on its growth strategy, acquiring the remaining assets of Bright.md following the sale of its technology to Evernorth, and continuing to service long-time customers Baptist Health, UAB Medicine and 14 others.\n\nThe Balancing Act: Addressing Clinician Burnout and Patient Preferences\n\nClinician burnout is rampant, with over 45% of healthcare workers feeling burnout often or very often. Meanwhile, patients are embracing digital solutions: 64% want to receive some, most, or all of their health care virtually or online in the future. By giving providers the flexibility to support multiple modes of digitally communicating with patients based on their lifestyle and care preferences, 98point6’s asynchronous virtual care module helps mitigate clinician burnout while enhancing the patient experience.\n\n“In more than two years on the platform, Bright.md exceeded our high expectations for an asynchronous digital health partner,” said Brett Oliver, MD, Chief Medical Information Officer at Baptist Health. “As our patient and clinician needs evolve, we look forward to establishing a new partnership with 98point6 Technologies to extend our patient offerings, drive operational efficiencies and further advance our mission of providing innovative, quality care to the people of Kentucky and southern Indiana.\"\n\nAsynchronous care delivery represents the next service offering for 98point6 and a commitment to growth since launching as a licensed software provider last year. The async software offering enables providers to respond when their schedule allows, backed by a solution that takes clinical decision support to the next level. The robust technology deploys machine learning models to establish an intelligent engine that supports providers with intake, diagnosis, and care documentation. Developed by a team with a proven track record of building and managing a successful nationwide virtual clinic serving millions of patients, the module paves the way for further innovations.\n\n\"Our mission at 98point6 is to build market leading technology that empower healthcare providers with the tools they need to broaden access, enhance patient engagement, and achieve cost savings through greater provider efficiency,” said Jay Burrell, CEO of 98point6 Technologies. “With the Bright.md acquisition we are dramatically accelerating our efforts to offer a robust, multi-functional virtual care software platform and it’s a tremendous opportunity to engage with these 16 innovative health systems.”\n\nFor more information on the new asynchronous offering, visit 98point6.com.\n\nAbout 98point6 Technologies\n\n98point6 Technologies builds and licenses software to power exceptional virtual care experiences for providers and patients based on years of clinical use across millions of patients. Its flagship 98point6 Technology Platform consists of turnkey, cloud-based software that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence bundled with time-tested, automated practice standards and electronic health record (EHR) integration.

      "# [Celebrating One Year, One Team, One Place – Transcarent](https://transcarent.com/blog/celebrating-one-year-one-team-one-place)\nGlen Tullman, Chief Executive Officer, Transcarent\n\nBuilding great businesses is something that I love to do, and part of that includes knowing when and how to effectively scale. Acquisitions allow companies to grow by incorporating existing innovations, increasing market share, and many times, expanding the workforce for greater impact. In my 30+ years of building businesses, I have led dozens of mergers and acquisitions of all sizes and on both sides of the transaction. Having witnessed many successes and a few pitfalls, I believe that a shared mission and like-cultures are strong determinants of whether or not a transaction will be successful.\n\nI always say that it is easier to fix something, than to start from scratch. So long as the leadership teams who are involved in a transaction share similar values and relentlessly believe that together, they can deliver a better experience for the end user, M&A activity can be incredibly powerful, improve outcomes and business operations, and be a smart investment.\n\nWhen I first met with the team at 98point6, the leader in AI-enabled virtual care, I saw the value their technology, their clinic, and their wildly talented team, could bring to the future of Transcarent and our Members. With experience dating back to 2017 they were forward-thinking, ahead of the curve in healthcare AI, had a robust portfolio of clients and Members, and most importantly, shared a similar mission as Transcarent. Simply put, they were committed to making health and care better for people, including the physicians and others who deliver care and those of us who receive it. They were looking for directional support, commitment, and leadership that would put their technology in the hands of many more people . . . a strength of ours at Transcarent, and we were in search of forward-looking technology that could transform the virtual primary care experience. After our first discussions, the transaction was complete.\n\nOver the past year, our teams came together with the mindset of “one.” One Team. One Mission. One Place for Health and Care. This cultural mindset was ingrained from the start and made for a nearly flawless integration. Yes, we dropped a few balls along the way, but people always knew what our intent was . . . to make this the best place people ever worked and to create an experience of health and care that was new, better, and different than anything else they had come across. I am proud to say we can celebrate one year as one company that has undeniably achieved more together than we ever could have achieved alone.\n\nNothing is more important than our health and care. And no industry will have more impact on our success as a country in the future. However, despite its importance, no industry is more in need of change and improvement. 98point6 made it easy to access care 24x7x365 – easier and faster than ever before – without losing the physician connection. Since acquiring 98point6, we have continued to invest in their revolutionary AI-powered health and care experience. We even had the opportunity to highlight in front of Congress how we are delivering an experience, leading with clinical expertise, from start to finish, that is private and secure, and built to meet and exceed the needs of health consumers. Additionally, we introduced point-of-care navigation capabilities by combining the power of Transcarent's digital platform and benefit ecosystem with virtual care delivery. Expect to hear more from us regarding AI and the ways it will transform virtual primary care visits.\n\nOne of the things we are most proud of is that we are leveraging one of our greatest assets, clinicians, for the part of the visits that require their intellect and experience. Due to the personal nature of this industry, we can’t rely on technology alone. When considering the acquisition with 98point6, their affiliated Physician Group was one of the strongest selling points. The talented and caring physicians, nurses, and other clinicians who comprise the group complete the experience we’re trying to create at Transcarent . . . one that people love, offers high-quality health and care, and does so at a price that people can afford.\n\nWhen we founded Transcarent, we knew the vision of bringing all of health and care, both virtual and in-person, together on a single platform, wasn’t going to be easy or fast. But we’re here, committed as ever, with a steadfast focus on our mission of providing access to high-quality, affordable health and care. We’ve taken the steps necessary, including M&A activity and integrating other innovative solutions into our platform, to build an easy-to-use platform for our Members and clients and company for our employees.\n\nOur work is well underway, we’ve come a long way, but as Bill Gates wisely said, “If I'd had some set idea of a finish line, don't you think I would have crossed it years ago?”\n\nThanks to everyone at Transcarent for your hard work and commitment to making the last year a success.",

      "# [Powered Consumer Health Experience – Transcarent](https://transcarent.com/press-releases/transcarent-introduces-wayfinding-an-ai-powered-consumer-health-experience)\nSan Francisco, CA May 15, 2024 - Today, Transcarent, the One Place for Health and Care, announced WayFinding, a new experience that seamlessly combines generative AI with instant access to care providers to integrate benefits navigation, clinical guidance, and care delivery on one easy to use platform. WayFinding personalizes each person’s experience, orienting and guiding them through their health and care journeys, with human support never more than a tap away.\n\nWayFinding provides Members with personalized support and guidance, beginning with questions about what’s covered and what it might cost. It moves them seamlessly to the next best clinical action to take through specific guidance, and then instantly connects them to medical professionals or provides direct access into digital point solutions uniquely suited to address specific issues.\n\nAccording to a 2023 KFF poll, more than 50 percent of insured adults in America say it is difficult to understand at least some aspect of their health insurance. Forty percent of Americans with employer sponsored coverage said they didn’t understand what their health insurance covers, while 27 percent lacked understanding about specific terms their health insurance uses such as \"deductible,\" \"copay,\" and \"co-insurance.\" Increasing a person’s access to benefits information is critical as uncertainty often leads to unexpected cost, and medical debt is the number one cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. Most Americans find their healthcare to be more confusing, more complex, and more costly than ever before and getting worse, not better, with 70 percent feeling failed by the healthcare system.\n\nWayFinding addresses this complexity, uniquely combining new advancements made possible through generative AI with better information and on-demand access to clinicians, along with access to virtual point solutions and local in-person care. With WayFinding, Transcarent Members can access the care they deserve and employers can be confident their benefits are being used efficiently and effectively.\n\n“Imagine if you could go to one place, 24 hours a day, to access all your benefits, get the unbiased medical guidance you need, and then have instant access to a doctor or other healthcare professional or connect to the leading point solutions with no separate logins and membership cards needed. That’s what we’ve all been dreaming about and today Transcarent is delivering on that vision,” said Glen Tullman, Chief Executive Officer of Transcarent. “This is not just better than traditional navigation, it’s completely different. It’s like moving from a flip phone to an iPhone. The flip phone did one thing. The iPhone does everything. And we’re doing it all at half the price of traditional navigators.”\n\nThe launch of WayFinding builds on Transcarent's earlier work to responsibly incorporate AI-enabled care into the Member experience, starting with the acquisition of the 98point6 care platform, the industry-leading AI-powered care delivery solution, which facilitates immediate access to high-quality, virtual care. Using our database of close to one million documented physician chats, which informs our proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs), paired with significant investments in building an AI team over the last year, Transcarent is set apart from others in the industry. Additionally, Transcarent uses custom testing, validation, and monitoring tools to enable responsible AI development and has built a proprietary multi-pronged safety system that acts as a common safety layer across all our AI products. Our membership in and work with the Data & Trust Alliance has also informed how to use AI safely and securely.\n\nWayFinding is the answer to the challenge of getting people the right information, when and where they need it. It also reduces the burden on human resources and benefits professionals, having to spend hours answering questions from confused employees. WayFinding will drive significant improvements in utilization and engagement.\n\n“WayFinding orients you. By pulling in every detail of an employer’s plan, any offered ancillary benefits, your medical history, and pairing that information with our team of top-rated virtual care clinical specialists, we can create a personalized understanding of each Member’s unique care needs, getting them exactly where they need to be every single time,” said Snezana Mahon, PharmD, Chief Operating Officer of Transcarent. “Your health and care should know you. With WayFinding, that’s now possible. This is the future of navigation and more.”\n\nTranscarent has a proven track record of delivering care experiences that Members value, returning to the experience time and again to meet their health and care needs. Of the Transcarent Members that activate, our 70 percent utilization and retention rates demonstrate that we are delivering on our mission of making it easy to access high-quality, affordable health and care.\n\nClick here to schedule a WayFinding demo.\n\nAbout Transcarent\n\nTranscarent is the One Place for Health and Care.

      "# [Transcarent Raises $126 Million Series D – Transcarent](https://transcarent.com/press-releases/transcarent-raises-usd126-million-series-d)\nSan Francisco, CA, May 2, 2024 – Transcarent, the One Place for Health and Care, announced a $126 million Series D investment led by General Catalyst and 7wireVentures, joined by new investors Geodesic Capital and Memorial Hermann Health System, with support from previous investors Threshold Ventures, Kinnevik, Ally Bridge Group, Human Capital, Merck Global Health Innovation Fund, Alta Partners, and Leaps by Bayer.\n\nThis round brings Transcarent’s total funding raised to approximately $450 million from a diverse group of investors at a valuation of $2.2 billion. The pre-emptive outreach from investors interested in a Series D underscores the confidence in Transcarent's vision and its relentless commitment to cutting through the confusion and complexity while at the same time removing cost from the healthcare system. The additional investments will be leveraged to accelerate AI capabilities, support commercial growth, and for strategic growth opportunities.\n\nTranscarent’s industry leading health and care platform makes it easy for people to access care and employers to provide and pay for the care. It is the only platform that brings together medical, surgery, pharmacy, and mental health care into one place. The Transcarent platform connects Members to comprehensive care experiences including Everyday Care (which includes Care in 60 Seconds), Pharmacy Care, Surgery Care (from the country's leading health systems, ambulatory care providers, and Centers of Excellence), Weight Health, and end-to-end Cancer Care.\n\n“Everyone asked, 'can you make it easier for our people to access high-quality, affordable care?', and we have. Transcarent is the One Place for Health and Care,” said Glen Tullman, Transcarent Chief Executive Officer. “One platform --- your mobile phone --- for everything you want and need. And an experience people don’t just like but love. High-quality care and cost reductions with a relentless focus on quality. Just what the doctor ordered.”\n\n\"Rising healthcare costs place a significant strain on employers and limit US economic growth and vitality,\" said Ken Frazier, Executive Chairman, Transcarent; Chairman, Health Assurance Initiatives, General Catalyst; and former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Merck. “I am proud of the progress Transcarent has made to improve the current system for employers and employees alike who are demanding a better, more affordable health and care experience. The outcomes that Transcarent has delivered allow all stakeholders to focus on what matters most: empowering employees with improved access to health and wellness care.\"\n\n\"Our continued support in Transcarent is driven by their technology, in what we believe is an unmatched integration of software, AI, robust data science, and tailored health guidance. This combination has sparked real change in the delivery of health and care, aligning with our founding mission: to empower millions in navigating the complexities of the healthcare system and achieve better health outcomes,” said Hemant Taneja, CEO and Managing Director, General Catalyst.\n\n“For too long consumers have been left behind by our healthcare system,” said Lee Shapiro, Managing Partner, 7wireVentures. “Transcarent has proven that putting consumers first pays off. By meaningfully engaging consumers in their care, empowering them with the real-time information they need to make the best decisions about their health and care, we see higher quality outcomes and costs go down.”\n\n“Transcarent is bending the healthcare cost curve for consumers and employers, demonstrating that you can deliver great care and a great experience while also decreasing costs,” said John Roos, Founding Partner, Geodesic Capital. “The Transcarent platform is redefining how care is accessed and delivered for millions of Americans.

The U.S. spent $4.4 trillion on healthcare in 2022, projected to reach $7.2 trillion in 20311. Health spending is expected to grow an average of 5.4% per year on average between 2022 and 2031, outpacing growth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and accounting for 19.6% of the nation’s overall economy by 20312.\n\nSince the Series C round in January 2022, Transcarent has launched comprehensive Weight Health, Cancer, Behavioral Health and Pharmacy Care Experiences in addition to growing their industry-leading, value-based Surgery Centers of Excellence program.

      "# [Members eliminate medications and see significant, sustained weight loss on its Type 2 diabetes reversal program through Virta Health](https://www.banneraetna.com/en/about-us/news/type-2-diabetes-reversal-program-through-virta-health.html)\nIn one year, members eliminated 66% of diabetes medications through the personalized, nutrition-first approach\n\nPhoenix, AZ (August 28, 2024): Banner|Aetna, a joint venture health plan owned by Banner Health and Aetna, a CVS Health company, announced one-year member outcomes from its diabetes reversal program powered by Virta Health, a leader in diabetes reversal and sustainable weight loss.\n\nAfter just six months, Banner|Aetna members saw transformational health outcomes. In one year, those results are even more dramatic and demonstrate the long-lasting success of Virta’s program. Sustained metabolic health improvements for Banner|Aetna members enrolled at one year include:\n\nPrescription reduction: Members eliminated 66% of diabetes medications (excluding metformin), including an 83% reduction in insulin dosages. Of those on insulin, 58% eliminated it completely.\n\nBlood sugar reduction: On average, members saw a 1.4% reduction in A1c blood sugar levels. Every one-point decrease in A1c reduces the risk of long-term diabetes complications by up to 40%.\n\nClinically significant weight loss: Members experienced 11% weight loss on average (5% is considered clinically significant). Clinically significant weight loss can lead to better sleep, reduced inflammation, improved blood pressure, reduced risk of heart disease and positive impacts on arthritis and fatty liver disease.\n\nBanner|Aetna members nationwide receive care that fits their unique lifestyle, culture, dietary preferences, and budget thanks to Virta’s expert care and personalized approach to nutrition.\n\n“Virta is flexible, and that’s why it works,” said Robert Groves, MD, executive vice president and chief medical officer at Banner|Aetna. “With one-on-one support and individualized nutrition plans, our members are achieving life-changing outcomes that last, without the need for expensive medications like GLP1s.”\n\nBanner|Aetna member David—a middle school teacher in Yuma, AZ—spent years struggling with his out-of-control Type 2 diabetes. Even while injecting two types of insulin up to six times per day, David’s blood sugar jumped to dangerous levels and he continued to gain weight. After losing several family members to the disease, he knew it was time to make a change.\n\nSince starting Virta in 2022, David has eliminated his insulin and lost 45 pounds, while lowering his blood sugar below the diabetes threshold. Most importantly, he no longer lives in fear.\n\n“After having a stroke and losing my sister to Type 2 diabetes, I was scared,” said David. “But with Virta, I’ve taken control of my health and can be excited for the future—it’s truly been life-changing.”\n\nBanner|Aetna currently offers Type 2 diabetes reversal to eligible members of fully insured and Administrative Services Only groups. The program to reverse prediabetes is also available to self-insured groups.\n\nAbout Banner|Aetna\n\nBanner|Aetna is a health insurance company focusing on bettering member outcomes at a lower cost, all while improving the overall member experience for employers and consumers in Arizona. The collaboration combines Banner Health’s high-quality, local providers and delivery systems with Aetna’s health-plan experience, care management and health information technology.

      "# [Seattle Chicken Chain Mt. Joy Wants to Conquer the World, Then Save It by Harry Cheadle on 2023-12-13](https://seattle.eater.com/2023/12/13/23999134/mt-joy-fried-chicken-sandwich-regenerative-farming-seattle-robbie-cape)\nIt’s a bright, windy fall day on Capitol Hill, and Robbie Cape has crouched down to futz with the legs on the inflatable tube man outside Mt. Joy, his food truck. “It’s not straight,” Cape says, making an adjustment before muttering, “That’ll have to do.”\n\nCape is a bald, middle-aged man with the infectious energy of a tech entrepreneur and the plastic-rimmed glasses of a tech entrepreneur. He worked at Microsoft before founding and then selling the family-scheduling app Cozi; he followed that up by co-founding the chatbot telemedicine startup 98point6 and serving as its CEO until the board replaced him in 2021. That’s an unusual resume for the operator of a fried chicken sandwich joint, but Mt. Joy is so much more than a food truck and a nearby brick-and-mortar restaurant. To hear Cape tell it, the inflatable tube man marks the beachhead of a chain that will one day have hundreds of locations. Mt. Joy already has a sleek website, an app, and a team that includes Ethan Stowell, Seattle’s most bankable restaurateur, who is a co-founder.\n\nBut Cape is dreaming even bigger: He envisions a future where Mt. Joy pressures the nation’s food-supply system to reform in a way that will improve conditions for livestock, raise wages for farmworkers, and even fight climate change. Oh, and at that point, Mt. Joy will be a billion-dollar company.\n\n“When I started looking for my next gig after Cozi,” Cape tells Eater Seattle, “I wanted to work on companies that checked two boxes… Number one, the companies had to be multibillion-dollar opportunities — like, at scale, they could be valued at billions of dollars. And number two, that at that scale they could repair the world in a meaningful way.” This makes Mt. Joy possibly the most ambitious, audacious food business in Seattle. It’s certainly the most ambitious business that started in the parking lot of a former Starbucks.\n\nAfter leaving 98point6, Cape was trying to figure out his next move, and he wasn’t thinking about restaurants. He was thinking about the environment. His research, which included watching the 2020 documentary Kiss the Ground, led him to focus on “regenerative agriculture,” a somewhat vague term that refers to a set of practices that advocates say are more in tune with nature and better for the planet than industrial farming methods.\n\nSometimes, those advocates for regenerative agriculture make grandiose claims. In Kiss the Ground, over a montage of climate change-related disasters, narrator Woody Harrelson says that there’s “a simple solution, a way to heal our planet and keep our species off the extinction list.” He goes on:\n\nWe call it soil, earth, or ground. And due to its vast scale and its ability to sequester immense quantities of greenhouse gases, it could just be the one thing that can balance our climate, replenish our freshwater supplies, and feed the world.\n\nRegenerative Organic Alliance, an organization that certifies farms as “Regenerative Organic” and therefore has to be more rigorous than Woody Harrelson, has a list of practices farmers should adopt to meet its standards. This includes crop rotation or the seasonal use of cover crops (rather than using a plot of land to grow only one thing, aka monoculture); tilling, or breaking the soil with a plow or other machine, as little as possible; raising livestock alongside crops; and not using synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. The goal of all this is to maintain a healthy ecosystem of insects, worms, and fungus in the soil, which makes it more resistant to erosion, more able to hold water, and capable of sequestering carbon from the air, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help fight climate change. To be certified by ROA, farms must pay their workers fairly and treat them well (a standard not all farms have lived up to). They must also care for their animals better than industrial farms do — allowing chickens to roam freely on pastures, for instance — which advocates say makes the meat taste better.\n\n“The concept of regenerative agriculture, it set my brain on fire,” Cape says. “Here’s a methodology that is better for the farmer, better for the animals, better for the land. And it produces a product that’s better for the people. Why aren’t more people doing it?”\n\nCape set out to talk to regenerative farmers. One of them was Grant Jones, the owner of Hungry Hollow Farm in Shelton, a couple hours southwest of Seattle. “The big bottleneck is demand,” Jones tells Eater Seattle. “We need more people to buy our product; we need more people to care about what we’re doing.”\n\nEventually, the Mt. Joy founder talked to Joel Salatin, one of the country’s most famous regenerative farmers. “He’s like, ‘Robbie, if you want to get more farmers to farm this way, you need to launch a restaurant,’” Cape recalls of the conversation. “‘If you build demand for food that is grown this way, the supply will follow.’” (Salatin, who at one point was a sort-of spokesperson for the regenerative agriculture movement, is also a right-wing political eccentric who flouted pandemic lockdown rules. He has no association whatsoever with Mt. Joy.)\n\nCape initially rejected the idea because he knew nothing about the restaurant industry. But after conversations with friends and restaurant industry professionals, including Ethan Stowell — who owns How to Cook a Wolf, Rione XIII, and too many other restaurants to name — he gradually became convinced that a restaurant was the right path forward. Cape is an entrepreneur who believes, maybe unfashionably, that a for-profit business can make the world a better place. “For all of the issues I have with Elon Musk,” he says, “he showed the market that you could build a great car business worth a lot of money as an electric-vehicle company.” What Musk did to popularize electric cars, Cape could maybe do for chickens.\n\nNationwide, there are a lot of entrepreneurs like Cape trying to disrupt the food industry for the better, whether that means investing in plant-based “meat” or lab-grown chicken; chickens and eggs that are labeled “regenerative” or “pasture-raised” are now commonplace in grocery stores and direct-to-consumer sites. In one sense, Cape is hopping on a trend; in another, he’s trying to accelerate it.\n\nAs Cape set out to develop Mt. Joy, he met with Stowell frequently to learn the restaurant business, and brought the restaurateur on as a co-founder. Cape also staged (the restaurant equivalent of working an unpaid internship) at two of Stowell’s restaurants, Victor’s Tavern and the Woodinville location of Ballard Pizza — the 54-year-old’s first-ever restaurant experience. “It was great! I loved it!” Cape says. “Restaurants are very often balancing on the tip of a needle, between organized and chaos. It’s amazing how they do it.” He has a scar on his arm from a pizza oven, which he is happy to show off.\n\nSo: Why chicken? From the very first meeting, Cape says, Stowell “intuited” that their venture should be a fried chicken restaurant. “It turns out that’s the right answer for a lot of reasons,” Cape says. For one thing, chicken, particularly fried chicken, is exploding in popularity. (There’s a Korean fried chicken place across the street from the Mt. Joy truck, and Dave’s Hot Chicken, a Nashville-style chain, opened on Capitol Hill the same week as the Mt. Joy restaurant.) Another reason has to do with the short lives of chickens. “Given that we’re building a new supply chain, it turns out that an animal with a relatively short gestation period and a relatively short lifespan is better, because it allows us to cycle up the supply chain faster,” Cape says.\n\nAlready, he says, Mt. Joy’s presence is encouraging local farms to produce regeneratively farmed chicken. Jones, of Hungry Hollow, has joined the company as a co-founder and chief agricultural officer, and Mt. Joy is using four other Western Washington farms to supply it with chickens. While a small farm might have to predict the appropriate amount of chickens to raise annually, having consistent preordering from a customer allows farms to invest in raising more birds. “Within a few months, we were able to get additional production out of them that they were not counting on producing,” Cape says, because Mt. Joy could commit to buying their chickens. (Regeneratively farmed chickens are expensive; Mt. Joy pays nearly $8 a pound for whole birds.)\n\nThe company has also recruited Mark Anderson, a farmer and the owner of Anderson Hay in Ellensburg, Washington. Anderson raises grass-fed beef cattle using regenerative methods, and next year will be raising chickens for Mt. Joy, early proof of Cape’s theory that he can create the supply chain he needs as his business grows. Anderson will be processing chickens as well; he says he can process tens of thousands of animals if Mt. Joy needs it. (As of mid-December, the company has used about 4,000 chickens total, Cape says.)\n\n“I’m very, very aligned with Robbie, I think his vision and mission is spot-on,” says Anderson. “I don’t think he does anything he doesn’t deeply believe in... He’s a great visionary.”\n\nMt. Joy’s first brick-and-mortar restaurant opened on December 1 on 11th Avenue and Pine Street, just across the street from Cal Anderson Park. If Cape’s dreams come true, that restaurant will be followed swiftly by others in Western Washington, then more in other regions, until one day Mt. Joy is as ubiquitous and numerous as Chipotle. (Cape is looking to expand to the East Side, though he says he needs to “raise additional capital” before any expansion.) At some point, Mt. Joy would become such a big buyer of chicken that it would have influence over how chickens are raised across a broader supply chain. “Our goal is to reach a scale where we can impact the entire industry,” Cape says.\n\nIf Mt. Joy achieves whatCape envisions — a daunting prospect — it will have to contend with the slippery nature of the word “regenerative.”\n\n“A person can say, ‘I’m farming regeneratively,’ and you don’t really know exactly what that means,” says Melissa Spear, the executive director of Tilth Alliance, a nonprofit that promotes regenerative farming, among other food- and farming-related policies. As regenerative farming has become hip, large companies like General Mills have touted regenerative initiatives that stop well short of what advocates like Spear would like to see — General Mills promotes low- and no-till farming, “which is actually really important,” Spear says, but continues to use pesticides, which are generally frowned upon in the regenerative community.\n\nOne way to cut through the ambiguity around the term regenerative is the regenerative organic certification process, by which farms can get an outside stamp of approval. But many small and midsize farmers interested in these practices aren’t taking this route, Spear says, because it is expensive and time-consuming. “Part of what needs to happen in general is we need to make getting certified easier,” she says.\n\nMt. Joy hasn’t focused on getting its farms certified primarily due to cost, Cape says. “Our perspective is that we want to be completely transparent,” he says. “We don’t need the certification because we want to show you the farm.” (On the Mt. Joy website, you can see videos of the chickens in pastures.)\n\nSpear isn’t necessarily satisfied with Mt. Joy’s current level of disclosure, however. She wants to know how much the company pays its workers, among other things — “total transparency.” (Cape says Mt. Joy offers a “very competitive wage,” benefits, and equity in the company after three months.)\n\nIf Mt. Joy ever did become so large and powerful that it could tell farmers how to raise chickens, Cape has already sketched out some ideas for what he would request of its future suppliers: He would ask them to raise the Freedom Ranger Color Yield, chickens specifically bred to live outside, and to put the birds on fresh pasture every day. “We want our chickens to live in their natural habitat and be intelligently incorporated into the farm ecosystem,” he says. This is better for the chickens and better for the soil, too: As the chickens scratch and peck at the earth and fertilize it with their manure, they improve the soil health.\n\nWould those practices be enough for advocates like Spear to agree their chickens are “regenerative”? Maybe, maybe not.\n\nAnother question around regenerative farming is exactly how much carbon soil can sequester, and for how long. This is a highly technical matter and researchers are looking into it, but the planet-saving portrayal in Kiss the Ground is almost certainly too optimistic. (Spear calls the film “kind of like propaganda” while praising the attention it’s brought to regenerative farming.)\n\nMt. Joy’s marketing materials don’t lean too hard into the save-the-climate messaging, and Cape says that’s because he believes the question “How much carbon can the soil sequester and for how long?” is a “red herring.” More importantly, he says, regenerative farming is better for the soil and animals and provides better wages for the people working in the supply chain than traditional industrial farming.\n\nCould Mt. Joy help push the U.S. toward regenerative practices? First, it has to be a successful business, which requires it to make a sandwich people love. As Cape puts it: “The conduit of our platform is the fried chicken sandwich.” The conduit’s breading has a briny, umami bite to it, while the meat inside is juicy and flavorful. Unusually, Mt. Joy sells a dark meat sandwich, which gives you an extra layer of richness and gaminess. Though the chicken is the star ingredient, it’s balanced out by tangy pickles and a slightly crunchy tomato. Mt. Joy also sells fries with a variety of sauces and high-quality shakes in flavors like strawberry basil.\n\nThe in-utero chain may be setting out to revolutionize the chicken industry on the supply side. But in terms of customer experience, no wheel is getting reinvented here. It’s the typical 21st-century fast-casual journey, where you walk in, order on a touchscreen, and get a pretty good, pretty satisfying sandwich for around $15.\n\nMt. Joy is also, apart from all that other stuff, a pretty typical food truck. It’s centered around a single dish, aided by some splashy branding, and run by a dreamer with more than the usual amount of energy — the kind of person who gets into the restaurant industry, when you get right down to it. In the days before the restaurant opened, Cape was at the truck a lot, he says, “doing whatever needs to be done,” adjusting inflatable men, saying hello to customers, asking how the food was, telling them he looks forward to seeing them come back.\n\nIs this fun for the former tech CEO, owning a restaurant? “Oh,” he says with a smile, “I love it!”",

Virtual Therapeutics, which approaches mental health through VR-enabled games, and Akili Interactive, with online prescription games designed for ADHD and other cognitive impairments, yesterday announced plans to merge. The new company will retain the Virtual Therapeutics name and go private, with Akili operating as a subsidiary. The cash buyout to Akili shareholders will be based on $0.4340 per share of common stock (Nasdaq) or $34 million, a premium around 4%. Akili had announced on 29 April that it was seeking “strategic alternatives”. Shares were trading then at $0.235 so the offering is over an 80% premium to that time. In May, Akili announced a reduced Q1 2024 net loss compared to Q4 2023. The transaction is expected to close in Q3, subject to Akili retaining a specified cash position and a tender conversion. Management transitions have not been disclosed. Release, MedTechDive\n\nWhy are all the health tech clinics struggling–at once? CNBC polls a group of experts and deduces that what it calls the “2.0 version of primary care” in Walmart Health, CVS Minute Clinics (closing dozens of Minute Clinics in Southern California and New England), and Walgreens’ VillageMD, is foundering under:\n\nThin to non-existent margins–reimbursements are low, but the expenses of running them are high\n\nLack of ‘volume selling’\n\nLack of workforce–doctors don’t want to go to rural areas, which was Walmart’s bet. Nurse-practitioners can’t care for patients (and bill) if they also are detailed to do cleanup\n\nCross-selling a flop–if you’re in for a pint of milk, Advil, or shampoo, you’re not going into the clinic, and vice versa\n\nA 3.0 model may have a lot of variants, such as One Medical’s subscription model ($9/month for Amazon Prime members). Walgreens is opening a few in-store health clinics in the Hartford, Connecticut area to be run by Hartford HealthCare. In Arizona, a local Be Well Health Clinic near Arizona State University operates in a Walgreens and treats only sexual health issues. Kroger’s Atlanta-area Little Clinics will focus only on senior care.\n\nOne 3.0 experiment, DocGo’s vans in Dollar General parking lots, is over. Last year’s headscratching move to place DocGo’s urgent, preventative, and chronic care vans at specified hours in rural Dollar General parking lots [TTA 24 Jan 2023] was canceled some weeks ago. It never expanded beyond the three Tennessee locations, two in Clarksville and one in Cumberland Furnace that started last year.

Mobihealthnews\n\nOracle’s Glueck kicks back hard at Business Insider’s ‘deadly gamble’ article, Epic’s Faulkner (now with additional audio commentary)\n\nOracle is making great progress at the VA. And they want EHR interoperability. Epic doesn’t. Take that, Business Insider! And Judy Faulkner! Ken Glueck, an EVP at Oracle, authored an Oracle blog post (or at least one written under his name) that has generated much industry controversy. It first goes after Business Insider for daring to criticize the problems on the Oracle Cerner rollout that made it into five (count ’em, five) VA regional systems, calling it a ‘regurgitated story’. It calls the ‘deadly gamble’ headline ‘clickbait’, moves to patting itself on the back for the apparently non-problematic EHR rollout in about 3,900 locations in the DOD-Military Health System (partnering with Leidos), then swerves to stating the obvious in kicking around poor old, outdated VistA that meets very different needs and a massive population at the VA, and ends with a tap dance around the Oracle Cerner EHR problems at the VA citing all the progress that Oracle is making. It builds to a final slam fest, taking a minor quote in the article regarding why Oracle’s Larry Ellison preferred to buy Cerner–a ‘more relaxed approach to data privacy’–and expanding that to hard personal takedowns of Epic and its founder Judy Faulkner. It then gets personal with BI, depicting the publication as “rooting against us” which he finds “invigorating”.\n\nOne can understand the craving for Oracle management to respond to BI. It’s a media outlet that apparently doesn’t have the most friendly relationship with Oracle. (But since when is that a feature of the Fourth Estate?) The article vividly takes Oracle to task, weaving together an accessible story out of dry facts and the many technical failures well documented by the VA, the OIG, and in Congressional hearings. It’s framed in the noble ambitions of Oracle’s founder Larry Ellison to transform healthcare which, in this Editor’s view, are treated sympathetically. The extremely well-read review last week of the BI article notes all, as well as the lack of contrast with the non-eventful DOD-Military Health System’s implementation and why it went largely according to plan, including the joint Lovell MHS/VA EHR. While this Editor tends to cast a gimlet eye at the clichéd mention of ‘transforming healthcare’, she still has some hope that progress in simplification, transparency, better-informed decisions, and truly intelligent assistance that enables human providers to heal their patients will be made in the next decade. And in that, she is on the side of Mr. Ellison as well as most founders and companies in health tech chronicled in TTA’s articles since 2005.\n\nYou have to give Mr. Glueck some credit for not holding back on how he really feels. Unfortunately, he was writing a corporate communication even if it was slotted in Oracle’s blog pages. He’s worked in corporate for decades and early in his career in government in the late Senator Joe Lieberman’s (D-CT) office. From the blunt view of a marketer, he should know better. Tone matters. And the frostier the tone, the better. If even a response is needed. Consider: is responding to this a smart move? What are the knock on effects?\n\nIn fact, it’s almost a textbook on how not to respond to negative press.\n\nThe headline sets up a straw man argument: Business Insider is not responsible for healthcare modernization, nor conceivably will ever be. It’s a cheap shot.\n\nThe overly personal tone, written (one can guess) as he was seething about the BI article, undermines the response.\n\nNearly all of the same points could have been made in a concise, objective, fact-by-fact rebuttal that would be far more powerful in its restraint.\n\nIt meanders. It’s defensive. It’s easy to read into the Congressional Record or at the next hearing of the Veterans Affairs committee by a House member or Senator who’d like to see Oracle Cerner derailed at the VA.\n\nWhere it truly goes off the rails is the personal invective directed at their competition. “…Epic’s CEO Judy Faulkner is the single biggest obstacle to EHR interoperability. She opposes interoperability because it threatens Epic’s franchise.” Mr. Glueck goes further in stating that Oracle enables provider collaboration across silos, while “Epic’s contracts expressly appropriate all patient EHR data as Epic’s own.” This is a fair criticism if true but maybe Epic’s hospital customers like it that way for their own reasons like security.\n\nThe blog comes across as barely restrained and defensive, especially versus Epic, the #1 EHR. When your EHR is losing ground to the competition, this is not a good look. It hands Epic another club to beat Oracle with. When your audience consists of professional hospital and practice executives, plus the VA and Congress, who right now aren’t overly happy with your EHR and are firing Oracle or considering it, this is almost guaranteed to backfire. It also gives a provocative article in a small online publication (ask Elon Musk) what Oracle doesn’t want–very long legs and a long shelf life. Plus now, there is even more reason for BI to beat up on Oracle.\n\nPerhaps ignoring it, coupled with a sober internal communication (email/intranet/Slack) on the progress being made with the VA EHR (given that internal comms leak onto Reddit and similar), would have been the best response choices. And what about a conversation with BI?\n\nLike the old Sicilian saying about revenge, dishes like this should be served cold.\n\nSome interesting responses to the Oracle blog post are in HIStalk Reader Comments 5-31-24 Also Becker’s\n\nAnd if anyone at Oracle wants a free tutorial in what not to do to respond to negative press, from the perspective of someone who’s had to deal with it in two industries….donna.cusano@telecareaware.com\n\nListen to Editor Donna provide extra commentary–a take on this take–on the Ken Glueck blog and this article. Now on Soundcloud (~18 minutes).\n\nPerspectives: How Collaborative Care Combats Physician Burnout\n\nTTA has an open invitation to industry leaders to contribute to our Perspectives non-promotional opinion and thought leadership area. Today’s contribution is from Sussan Nwogwugwu, DNP, PMHNP, Clinical Leader at Done. In this article, Dr. Nwogwugwu discusses physician burnout, how it can affect delivery of care, and how collaborative and comprehensive care can mitigate burnout.\n\nDone is a leading provider of telehealth services for individuals with ADHD, dedicated to delivering comprehensive, patient-first care. With a network that spans more than 35 states, Done connects individuals with ADHD to experienced, board-certified providers for personalized treatment plans and medication management.\n\nPhysician burnout is a significant concern, as it affects not only physician well-being but the quality of care they deliver.\n\nThe state of primary physician burnout\n\nThe American Medical Association found that at the end of 2021, nearly 63% of physicians had reported burnout symptoms. This was roughly a 66% increase from the preceding year, highlighting the urgent need for systemic changes to support physician mental and emotional health. Increasing burnout is attributed to excessive workload, administrative burdens and lack of support and resources.\n\nCollaborative care and its benefits\n\nCollaboration between a team of multidisciplinary healthcare professionals decreases clinician workload and leads to enhanced job satisfaction. Additionally, feelings of isolation and burnout among physicians are reduced. Most importantly, the continued skill building and exchange of knowledge contribute to professional growth.\n\nFor mental health patients, collaborative care ensures holistic care and access to specialized services and continuity of care, particularly for patients managing chronic conditions.\n\nComprehensive care supports providers\n\nA collaborative care model is designed to reduce the burden on primary care providers; and enhance clinician well-being and patient care by integrating comprehensive behavioral health support within the primary care framework. Comprehensive care supports providers in several ways:\n\nImpact analysis\n\nImpact analysis, primarily powered by data analytics software, provides insights into treatment effectiveness. It is particularly helpful in guiding interventions.\n\nImpact analysis further addresses burnout and other issues by identifying areas for improvement, ultimately guaranteeing effective resource allocation and helping track the progress of interventions over time for better adjustments.\n\nEvidence-based interventions (EBI)\n\nEBI enables providers to use resources efficiently by enlightening them on what works and does not. It also enhances job satisfaction and morale, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes. Finally, using evidence-based treatments reduces the chances of facing legal action if something goes wrong.\n\nPhysicians leverage technology to learn more about EBIs across various medical fields; that can include digital libraries/databases, clinical decision support systems, mobile applications, telehealth platforms and online resources.\n\nFrequent reviews and an inclusive patient approach\n\nFrequent reviews help identify and address areas for practice improvement due to informative feedback they provide. An inclusive patient approach reduces burnout and provides a sense of fulfillment among providers by nurturing greater patient engagement and increasing satisfaction.\n\nComprehensive care supports patients\n\nIn addition to benefiting health care providers, comprehensive care benefits patients, too.\n\nImpact analysis\n\nImpact analysis fosters an in-depth understanding of a patient’s needs and responses to treatment, leading to more personalized care. Patients can also make informed decisions about their health and treatment options, guided by physician recommendations on helpful online resources.\n\nEvidence-based interventions\n\nEBI supports patients, reduces the risk of adverse effects, and ascertains that patients receive appropriate, high-quality, rigorously tested and proven care. Additionally, since EBI is founded on research and clinical evidence, it guarantees better health outcomes.\n\nFrequent reviews and an inclusive patient approach\n\nFrequent reviews enable personalized care and continuous treatment plan adjustment per each patient’s progress and feedback. Remote patient monitoring technologies like smart watches or mobile health apps help to track key health metrics and symptoms, thereby fostering patient empowerment and ensuring adherence to treatment plans by involving them in their own care.\n\nWhy medicine is shifting toward value-based care\n\nMedicine is gradually shifting to a value-based care model to deliver patient-centered, effective, cost-efficient healthcare. This is in response to the conventional fee-for-service model that incentivizes quantity over quality, which results in unnecessary procedures, fragmented care and unsustainable healthcare costs.\n\nTechnology, a key defining factor in value-based care, leverages EHRs, telemedicine platforms and data analytics tools to refine ADHD care and eliminate draining tasks that lead to burnout.\n\nTelemedicine platforms enable remote consultations, making it easier for patients to access specialized services without the need for physical visits. Additionally, data analytics tools track patient outcomes and identify trends, allowing for more personalized and effective treatment plans.\n\nThrough integrating EHRs, telemedicine platforms and advanced data analytics, multidisciplinary healthcare teams can streamline communication and coordination. EHRs provide team members access to up-to-date patient information, thereby reducing errors and enhancing continuity of care.\n\nCollaborative + comprehensive care = value-based care\n\nCollaborative and comprehensive care, combined with technology tools, contribute to value-based care by enhancing patient experience and treatment outcomes; and optimizing resource utilization.\n\nThese care models collectively promote improved population health, foster accountability and transparency and encourage continuous improvement.\n\nThrough collaborative care models, the value of health care is maximized and aligns with value-based care goals, alleviating increasing levels of physician burnout.\n\nNews roundup: Waystar $1B IPO is on (updated); CVS looking for Oak Street PE partner; 23andMe net loss doubles to $667M, may go private; Otsuka dives into digital therapeutics; HoneyNaps’ $12M no snooze\n\nWaystar finally getting around to starring in its IPO. Again. The on-again/off-again public offering for this healthcare payments software platform developer is back on, according to their Form S-1 filed yesterday (28 May) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Their first filing draft was in October 2023 on Nasdaq which would have valued the company at $8 billion. The IPO was again revived in December and postponed. This filing for WAY floats 45 million shares valued between $20 and $23 which would raise $1 billion with a far more reasonable valuation of $3.7 to $3.83 billion (latter updated per Waystar). Lead book-running managers are JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, and Barclays.\n\nCornerstone investors, who purchase stock before the formal listing, have expressed interest in buying up to $225 million in shares; these investors include funds managed by Neuberger Berman and a wholly-owned subsidiary of sovereign wealth fund Qatar Investment Authority.\n\nUnderwriters have a 30-day option to purchase up to 6.75 million shares at the IPO price less the underwriter discount. Their current investors are EQT AB, Bain Capital, Francisco Partners, and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. The net proceeds from the offering will repay outstanding indebtedness. No timing is stated for when the IPO will happen. Usually, there are roadshows for institutional investors that showcase the prospectus (in the S-1) and positive points such as their $5 billion in annual transactions. After the listing, the current investors will still have substantial shares: EQT, CPPIB, and Bain will own about 29.2%, 22.3%, and 16.8% stakes respectively.\n\nRelease, Morningstar, FierceHealthcare, Reuters\n\nCVS Health is reaching out for a private equity partner to expand Oak Street Health’s clinics. Bloomberg News reported this unusual move by CVS with a handful of private equity firms to explore what was termed by ‘insiders’ as a joint venture. It’s all very preliminary and a JV may not be the final form. OSH is far smaller than rivals One Medical (Amazon) and VillageMD (Walgreens) but CVS apparently does not want to go it alone to fully take on the development cost. On February investor calls, CVS projected building out to 300 clinics by 2026. Reuters\n\nEven in early 2023 with rivals Amazon (One Medical), Walgreens (VillageMD), and Walmart Health on primary care clinic buying and building binges, CVS’ buy for $10.6 billion for the ‘runt of the litter’ was widely derided as a waste of money [TTA 16 Feb, 2 Mar 2023]. OSH had only 169 offices in 21 states. It was also a money loser, $510 million in the red in 2022 and $200 million projected in 2023, with no breakeven predicted until 2025. A large part was due to OSH’s patient population, heavily skewed towards Medicare Advantage and underserved, high-risk patients. Those factors have gotten worse, not better. CMS has now tightened payments on MA with new rates and on reimbursement for diagnoses, making the growth of this population even riskier. Further dimming prospects for a willing partner: Walmart Health is shutting at end of June and VillageMD has shed or is shedding 140 locations to perhaps 620.\n\n23andMe’s losses double while revenue shrinks by 31%. Things continue to dim at the beleaguered genetics testing company. Their Q4 ending 31 March 2024 (FY24) closed with a net loss of $209 million on $64 million in revenue, compared to a net loss of $64 million on $94 million in revenue in the prior year Q4. In adjusted EBITDA, Q4 lost $33 million, compared to a loss of $39 million in prior year Q4. Net loss in full year FY24 was $667 million on revenue of $220 million, versus prior year’s loss of $312 million on revenue of $299 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $176 million versus prior year’s $161 million. As previously reported [TTA 20 Apr], CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki may offer to buy out the 80% of shares she does not already own. In developments, 23andMe has introduced an ancestry feature called Historical Matches, three new genetic reports for 23andMe+ members covering breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer based on polygenic risk scores, and some clinical trials moving forward. 23andMe also lost revenue in mid-year from GSK’s expiring agreement, had an impairment relating to Lemonaid Health, and of course (but not mentioned here) their massive 6.9 million record data breach. Shares closed today at $0.61, slightly up from April’s lows. Release\n\nOtsuka America bucks the down trend, moves into digital therapeutics with Otsuka Precision Health. The Japanese pharmaceutical company’s US division is moving forward with a new digital health unit, Precision Health (OPH), headed by 14 year veteran Sanket Shah. Their first rollout later this summer will be based on the newly FDA-cleared Rejoyn, the first prescription digital therapeutic authorized for the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) symptoms. Rejoyn was developed in conjunction with Click Therapeutics. Mr. Shah and Otsuka are taking the longer view in terms of development, that future developments will be about both partnerships and solo effort, and that the road is long–and littered with the burnt-out shells of failed companies like Pear Therapeutics, Babylon Health, and way back to Happtique. Otsuka has had its own digital health learning experience. They partnered in 2017 with Proteus Digital Health’s smart pill tech for its Abilify MyCite anti-depressant. After abruptly ending the partnership, Otsuka bought the smart pill technology out of bankruptcy [TTA 19 Aug 2020]. Release, Healthcare Dive\n\nOne funding of note this week is HoneyNaps‘ $11.6 million Series B. Hi Investment Partners, QUAD Investment Management, and Industrial Bank of Korea led the South Korean sleep diagnostics company’s funding. HoneyNaps has an FDA-cleared (2023) bio-signal monitoring and AI-assisted sleep diagnosis software, SOMNUM, that will be introduced to the US market. In the release, the company CFO announced plans to “further advance the AI to expand its application to other critical areas such as cardiovascular disease, dementia, and Parkinson’s disease”. Mobihealthnews\n\nBreaking news: Veradigm may sell, merge, or seek ‘strategic alternatives’; appoints new interim CEO effective June (updated)\n\nBreaking: Veradigm puts itself up for sale or ‘strategic alternatives’–but in the meantime replaces its interim CEO. The pre-holiday week and weekend break was undoubtedly a busy one at healthcare data systems/services Veradigm, the former Allscripts.\n\nSale? Merger? Something else? Crossing the wires today (Tuesday) at 7am Eastern Time US was the announcement that Veradigm is exploring “potential strategic alternatives that may include, but are not limited to, a sale, merger, strategic business combination or other transaction.” What was a puzzle was the next line in the carefully worded release: “The Company cannot assure that its exploration will result in Veradigm pursuing a transaction or that any transaction, if pursued, will be completed on attractive terms, if at all.” The release goes on to explain that there is no timetable for “any transaction” and that it was the last word until if and when something happens.\n\nThe doubt around ‘attractive terms’ seems unwarranted, as the same release also reaffirms their 2024 guidance of annual revenue between $620 million and $635 million and adjusted EBITDA between $104 million and $113 million. As of calendar Q1 close, they had cash/equivalents on hand of $343 million, funded debt of $208 million (the principal of 2019 convertible notes), creating net cash of $135 million.\n\nVeradigm appears in good shape, despite their delisting from Nasdaq earlier this year due to financial reporting problems two years running (2022, 2023, and 2024 to date), created by bad software, leading to continuing violations of Nasdaq listing rules. This led to the December resignations of CEO Richard J. Poulton and CFO Leah S. Jones and their replacement for a six-month term by Dr. Shih-Yin (“Yin”) Ho, coming from the board, as CEO, and Lee Westerfield from Clearsense as CFO. At that time, the board announced a search for permanent replacements [TTA 14 Dec 2023].\n\nShares trade on the ‘pink sheets’ (OTC Markets OTCPK) under MDRX closing today at $8.70, up over $1.00 from last Friday.\n\nInterim CEO departs, interim CFO stays. A second release today announced that Dr. Ho will depart the interim CEO slot on 7 June but interim CFO Lee Westerfield will continue. Dr. Ho’s place as interim CEO will be taken by Tom Langan, Veradigm’s president and chief commercial officer (CCO), reporting directly to executive chairman Greg Garrison and the board. No interim president/COO was named. From the release, Dr. Ho will not be returning to the board or any other function with Veradigm which is a most interesting exit. During her time, the company in February acquired ScienceIO, a generative AI/LLM company to add AI capabilities, and in January bought Koha Health, which fit into their revenue cycle management functions for MSK [TTA 27 Feb]. Lee Westerfield will be continuing as interim CFO until 24 December. Another change: this release made it clear that no permanent executive appointments will be made “while the separately announced exploration of strategic alternatives is in process.”\n\nWhat does this mean? This Editor projects that offers for parts or all of Veradigm’s business are in the pipeline, whether they are relisted on Nasdaq or not. In a company of this size, breadth, and apparent good health, the jobs of CEO, president, and chief commercial officer (CCO), typically two to three positions, are never collapsed into one person. In this unique situation, this eliminates one or two C-level compensation packages. Going back to December 2023, a CEO had to be temporarily slotted in as the company was still listed on Nasdaq. Leaving a vacancy would not have been acceptable. Regarding the CFO position, in a sale or other “strategic alternative to maximize shareholder value”, a CFO is more important than even a CEO in working out the financial details, which for Veradigm are more complicated than usual.\n\nIn fact, this move could be seen as telegraphed in February. When accepting its Nasdaq delisting, Veradigm’s board adopted a limited duration stockholder rights plan that issues by means of a dividend one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of Company common stock to stockholders of record on the close of business on 8 March 2024. This becomes exercisable only if a person or group secures beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding shares in the next year. The rights plan is obviously designed to compensate shareholders in the event of a takeover not approved by the board (i.e. a hostile takeover) via accumulation of stock and make a sale to an unapproved buyer less attractive, though it hasn’t stemmed the filing of various shareholder class-action lawsuits. Crain’s Chicago Business, Healthcare Innovation\n\nEditor’s further note: It is not unknown to break up a company in order to maximize shareholder value. The parts can be worth more than the whole. GE is the most recent example. More akin to Veradigm, Cendant Corporation, in which this Editor was once part of as a manager/director in the Avis Rent A Car unit, was sold or spun off in parts in 2005-6. Once a giant in hotel, car rental, timesharing, real estate brokerage, online booking, and other parts of travel, by 2005 the primary shareholder/CEO decided that the share value was not reflective of the company value, and proceeded to sell and spin off its businesses–rather smartly before the real estate crash in 2007-8. Perhaps Veradigm does not see a way forward in running its diverse healthcare businesses even where it has a strong and currently profitable position or there is pressure from its largest shareholders to cash out. It is always worth looking at shareholders. Close to 22% of its shares are institutionally held but widely distributed among them. The largest holders are Silver Point Capital (2.29%), Tyro Capital Management (1.5%), and a host of Vanguard and DFA funds totaling under 10%. Insiders hold only 1.3% Yahoo Finance\n\nOur Readers should not be surprised at any one of several outcomes in the coming months.\n\nShort takes: Cue Health shuts (updated for Ch. 7), Walmart Health lays off, Walgreens sells $400M share in Cencora, $26M Series B for Expressable\n\nCue Health gets the clue to shut down operations. It will be a Memorial Day to remember for the 480 remaining US employees of the San Diego-based company. Come Tuesday, none of them will be returning to work. The 230 scheduled earlier this month to wind up in July, plus the remaining 250, have their last day and paycheck on Friday 24 May, according to the WARN Act paperwork filed with the state of California. Notices were doled out to employees by the chief human resources office. The notice includes company leadership, presumably also including the new (since March) CEO Clint Sever. Cue has overseas operations in Hyderabad, India; it is unknown whether that will be affected.\n\nUpdate 28 May: Cue Health filed for Chapter 7 today in the District of Delaware to formally wind down its business. The press release stated that the board attempted to pursue additional financing or a strategic transaction. The next steps will be a bankruptcy trustee appointment to sell the Company’s assets. This will be used to pay creditors in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. Release\n\nCue Health’s collapse follows the news on 15 May that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) invalidated Cue Health’s main business in Covid-19 Tests for Home and OTC Use and for the authorized lab test version, advising that the tests be tossed in the trash. Their remaining test is one for Mpox on an EUA. Two other tests developed for flu and RSV are still under FDA review. At its peak, it had over 1,500 employees and was valued at $3 billion. Undoubtedly, none of this is a surprise to Cue’s employees who’ve been hanging on. Presumably the released employees will be lucky to receive their final paychecks and can forget about severance or health insurance via COBRA since that requires an existing business. Our best wishes to all of them. San Diego Union-Tribune, Becker’s, MedTechDive\n\nAnother unsurprising layoff is that of 74 workers at Walmart Health Virtual Care located in Phoenix. Last month, Walmart announced the closing of Virtual Care along with its 51 Health Centers for primary and urgent care, having never scaled its model. The WARN Act notice was filed with Arizona on 17 May. Employees were offered severance of 90 days if they were unable to close another Walmart position. This is on top of Walmart relocating most positions, including remote, to Bentonville, with some in the San Francisco and NYC areas. Becker’s, FierceHealthcare The Health Centers are closing on 28 June per an update from Walmart.

Release Hat tip to past colleague Amy VanStee, VP of content and marketing.\n\nNews roundup: 100+ medical orgs pile on Change/UHG; Teladoc hit with second class-action suit; Congress demands Oracle EHR improvement–or else; Transcarent intros WayFinding; Centivo buys Eden Health\n\nThe fallout from the Change cyberhack hangs like smog over UHG. On Monday, the American Medical Association (AMA), along with about 100 other signatories from nationwide medical associations including CHIME and AHIMA, sent a strongly worded letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra. It requested a clear delineation of responsibilities for breach reporting requirements created by the 21 February Change Healthcare ALPHV/Blackcat ransomware attack. Reporting is required by HHS’ Office of Civil Rights (OCR) under HIPAA.\n\nSpecifically, the AMA letter requested 1) more public clarity around reporting responsibilities to patients for the data breach and 2) that all reporting and notification responsibilities will be handled by Change Healthcare, not the providers. “OCR should publicly state that its breach investigation and immediate efforts at remediation will be focused on Change Healthcare, and not the providers affected by Change Healthcare’s breach”. To date, this doesn’t seem to be OCR’s position.\n\nThe AMA and signatory organizations maintain that it “is the responsibility of the covered entity which experienced the breach—UHG—to fulfill its obligations in regard to reporting the breach to OCR, notifying each affected individual, as well as any further HIPAA breach reporting requirements that may be applicable, such as notifying state Attorneys General and media outlets.”\n\nOCR, on the other hand, has gone on the record in April as stating in their FAQs that “while the covered entity is ultimately responsible for ensuring individuals are notified, the covered entity may delegate the responsibility of providing individual notices to the business associate. Covered entities and business associates should consider which entity is in the best position to provide notice to the individual, which may vary, depending on the circumstances, such as the functions the business associate performs on behalf of the covered entity and which entity has the relationship with the individual.” (Providers can be considered business associates)\n\nIn other words, the providers want the full responsibility of contacting patients, state attorneys general, media, and others (e.g. class action lawyers) to be Change Healthcare’s. They do not want to be forced to contact their patients and, in all fairness, at this point do not know which patients were affected because they are not privy to Change Healthcare’s information. UHG has not yet produced a breach report to OCR. AMA letter to Becerra, Healthcare Finance News\n\nWhen the stock falls, blame the marketing spend! The latest class-action lawsuit filed against Teladoc blames the company for spending money in digital and other media advertising promoting BetterHelp, their telementalhealth unit.

Yet spending increased in 2023. The lawsuit charges that this directly deteriorated the company’s revenue, leading to a substantial fall in its stock price. Charged are Teladoc, and at the time CEO Jason Gorevic and CFO Mala Murthy. Stary v. Teladoc Health, Inc. et al., was filed on May 17 in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. No response yet from Teladoc. Docket on Justia, Mobihealthnews\n\nThe House and Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committees jointly introduce legislation on VA’s EHR modernization. The Senator Elizabeth Dole 21st Century Veterans Healthcare and Benefits Improvement Act would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to exercise even greater oversight of the Oracle Cerner implementation in these areas:\n\nThe quarterly reports to Congress would include additional quality metrics on user adoption, employee satisfaction, and employee retention/turnover where the Oracle Cerner EHR is introduced. This adds to existing required reporting on spending and performance.\n\nRegarding additional rollouts, the VA secretary must certify that the sites are ready. He also must furnish corroborating data to Congress “demonstrating that all facilities currently using the Oracle Cerner EHR system have recovered to normal operational levels.”\n\nIf there is no improvement (presumably to this standard) at Oracle Cerner locations within two years of the bill’s enactment, the program will be terminated.\n\nVA must also report on the status of VistA with details about “the operation and maintenance costs and development and enhancement costs” of the software and “a list of modules, applications or systems” within VistA that VA plans to retire or continue to use.\n\nHIStalk 17 May, NextGov/FCW\n\n‘Not for sale’ Transcarent introduces an AI-assisted platform, WayFinding. The platform designed for end users of Transcarent’s enterprise health navigator combines generative AI with instant access to care providers to integrate benefits navigation, clinical guidance, and care delivery on a single platform. The personalized guidance enables the member to find a provider, find out costs, and guides to the best clinical action to take next. It then connects them to medical professionals or provides direct access into digital point solutions. It integrates information on details of the employer plan, ancillary benefits, the member’s medical history, and connection to clinical specialists. There is no information in the overly padded release on when the new platform will be available or how it will be offered to existing and new customers. This follows on Transcarent’s $124 million Series D funding two weeks ago. FierceHealthcare, Mobihealthnews, TTA 8 May\n\nCentivo acquires Eden Health virtual care. The purchase price was not disclosed. Centivo, headquartered in Buffalo NY, is a health plan for self-funded employers. Eden, also providing services to employers, is a concierge provider that offers through a mobile app primary care, mental health, and care navigation services, plus workplace pop-up clinics. Eden also has technology that connects providers’ EMRs to their app. Eden’s services will be fully integrated into Centivo, which will enable it to expand to 50 states and increase from its current 120 employer base to 160. The combined organizations cover about 2 million eligible patients in companies ranging from Fortune 100 size to small businesses. Eden’s CEO will serve as a senior advisor to Centivo, but there is no other indication of employee transition. Release, FierceHealthcare\n\nMust read: Oracle’s ‘deadly gamble’ on Cerner (new with audio file!)\n\nLarry Ellison’s $28 billion bet on Cerner is drawn and quartered in this Must Read. If any further confirmation is needed that Cerner was the proverbial pig-in-poke for Ellison’s Big Vision of welding all that Cerner EHR data with Oracle’s massive technology, it is right here. Ashley Stewart and Blake Dodge, writing for Business Insider, do a masterful job of painting how badly Ellison and Oracle misjudged what they were getting into with what proved to be Cerner’s “broken and dysfunctional system” that in the VA implementation has been put on hold, with one exception, for a year or maybe more.\n\nWhat Ellison thought he was buying in 2021 could be summarized by what he said at Oracle CloudWorld in fall 2023. FTA: What if, instead of guesswork, doctors could lean on generative AI to comb through a patient’s medical records, along with those of millions of other patients? With such a massive database, doctors could spot the warning signs of disease faster, reduce the need for trial and error, and make better-informed decisions about treatment. In other words, pump all that massive data into Oracle’s AI models and watch all that data, now going to waste, transform healthcare.\n\nThe problem was Cerner itself. Its EHR was not the wonder that Ellison saw circa 2005 when he first approached them and was rebuffed as a Silicon Valley interloper. It had become a system that wore lead boots compared to Epic. In the provider market, it was sinking to a distant #2. But one revelation in the article is that by 2020 Oracle saw Cerner as a must-have. As a smaller system, it was perceived as more interoperable between health systems, providers, and with third parties. Data would be more readily accessible. Pandemic-era relaxations on data sharing further loosened restrictions on access. The looseness appealed to Ellison and Company–and Cerner’s book of business would also help Oracle compete in cloud computing with Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft.\n\nBut Healthcare Reality dawned with the first implementations in the VA that started in 2020, a big win that turned into a rolling disaster that led to unknown queues, vanishing prescriptions, records, and appointments, and much more as chronicled here in the past four years, by Congressional investigations, and the VA’s OIG. No, the problems weren’t easily ‘fixable and addressable’ in Mike Sicilia’s (Oracle) words to Congress in hearings shortly after the acquisition closed. In fairly short order, the rollout came to a screeching halt after thousands of Oracle fixes, with only five systems implemented through last June, no end of disasters, patient deaths, and exacerbated illnesses. Other than the Lovell/MHS joint facility March rollout, there will be no further installations planned by the VA until the next fiscal year that starts in October. The most optimistic timeline for resumption is by end of this calendar year. As Congress is making clear, without proof of improved performance par with VistA in the current systems, do not hold your breath for any new ones.\n\nAn additional revelation in the article is that over time, VistA had become so customized to each VA medical center that Cerner could never meet those demands expected by the staff. It stopped trying, leading to more dissatisfaction. Perhaps that standardization looks good at the 40,000 foot level, but there were reasons for the customizations based on the veteran population and practice. Things that took two minutes in VistA now took ten in Cerner–if you were lucky. In the closed VistA system, those customizations were passed around other centers and regions–in VA-speak, Veterans Integrated Services Networks or VISNs. (Editor’s note: recalling from one of her former companies, any IT vendor implementing a system VISN by VISN soon learned about each one’s unique demands at multiple levels.)\n\n“Oracle is still learning what they have actually acquired from Cerner,” according to an Oracle executive quoted in the article. The VA has become a ‘shackle’ trapping the Ellisonian Grand Vision of Oracle’s Transforming Healthcare–in time for him to enjoy his victory. Cerner’s slide to a distant #2 has reduced All That Data that made Cerner worth $28 billion, adding to a crushing debt load that this Editor and others noted in 2022. Layoffs and freezes haven’t made much difference, but have led to the loss of experienced Cerner support. The VA failures and drain of resources to fix it, the vacuum in support, and technical problems have led to, in a Providence system executive’s words, the perception that Cerner is ‘circling the drain’. And perception becomes reality. Health systems are choosing the costly route of moving now rather than later. The article mentions two major systems defecting to Epic, Intermountain and UPMC, but they are only two out of the 12 that announced in 2023.\n\nThe narrative succeeds in bringing together many threads, but most of all in bringing to life the dry facts of Cerner’s many patient failures in the VA, including the individual deaths from the unknown queues [TTA 18 Mar 2023] and the human story of the Two Charlies–Charlie Bourg (himself affected by the unknown queue) and Charlie Monroe, both veterans near Spokane’s Mann-Grandstaff VA medical center. They advocate for veteran patients affected by the Cerner EHR’s many flaws.\n\nOne of the flaws not mentioned is Cerner’s odd lack of concentration on training criticized by Congress in 2023 [TTA 19 Apr 2023]. Another sequel or extension to this article could delve into the DOD-Military Health System’s implementation, a Leidos-Cerner project that has had few of the reported problems of Cerner Millenium in the VA. This was quoted by a former VA official as a ‘terrible decision’ that knocked onto the VA in implementing into a much larger and more complex healthcare system. Hat tip to HIStalk 5/22/24\n\nEditor’s Closing Note: A wise doctor told me once that most errors in practice are made at the beginning and at the end of one’s career. In business, your Editor has seen this parallel happen time and time again. Even the smartest of chairmen and CEOs, when they stay too long at the fair, often make poor decisions. Is it age? Illness? No one left with the courage to tell them no, this is a bad move, this isn’t working? I think of the last years of Centene’s leader Michael Neidorff, 25 years in leadership, ousted by an activist shareholder. Mark Bertolini of Aetna, shoved aside from the merger with CVS he engineered. Frank Lorenzo, who created the biggest airline combine ever, Texas Air Corporation. Even legends like Larry Ellison at 79 may not be what they were.

Enovation is a Netherlands-based digital health company with a connected care platform for care monitoring across prevention, early detection, medication checks, and remote healthcare. Its customer base includes ambulances, pharmacies, clinics, hospitals, and home care. With distribution in healthcare organizations across 18 countries, including Scottish Digital Telecare [TTA 11 Aug 2021], it will join the equally international Legrand’s Assisted Living and Healthcare (AL&HC) business unit with Intervox, Neat, Tynetec, Jontek, and Aid Call. Acquisition cost was not disclosed. Release Legrand and Tynetec are long-time supporters of TTA.\n\nThe hammer drops on embattled Cue Health. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has invalidated Cue Health’s Covid-19 Tests for Home and OTC Use and for the authorized lab test version. Home users were advised to discard unused kits in household trash. Both consumers and providers were advised to retest if symptoms persisted after a negative test result. This followed an FDA inspection of their operations that determined that unauthorized changes to the test kit design were made along with failures in performance testing. A Warning Letter was issued to Cue on 9 May. The company has not yet responded. FDA Safety Communication\n\nCue was one of many biotech manufacturers that marketed Covid-19 point of care/lab, and home testing kits after obtaining Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) in 2020 and 2021. It exploded in size and went public in September 2021 at $200 million and $16/share with a valuation of $3 billion. Today HLTH shares trade on NasdaqCM at a little bit over $0.13. Their headquarters facilities in San Diego that once had 1,500 employees must be a lonely place, as the company reported another layoff of 230 employees, about half of remaining staff, after earlier layoff rounds of 245 in February and 880 in 2023. Their remaining test is one for Mpox on a EUA. Two other tests developed for flu and RSV are still under FDA review. Cue Health’s financial reports for 2023 were dismal with revenue down to $71 million, an 85% reduction versus 2022, and a net loss of $373.5 million.

Impacted systems include their EHR, MyChart, and some hospitals are diverting emergency care. The update page now has 12 regional updates and a general + patient FAQ. Update: in these states, Ascension’s retail pharmacies cannot fill prescriptions: Florida, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia. Their website recommends that patients bring paperwork and prescription containers. Lab and imaging results are delayed. Since the hospitals are on manual systems, overall there are delays in admissions–bring documentation. And the class-action suits have started, with reports that three have been filed already. Healthcare IT News\n\nWho dunnit? DataBreaches.net reported over the weekend that Ascension’s hack has been attributed to interestingly named ransomwareistes Black Basta. Late last week, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an alert on Black Basta.

Their business says so.\n\nOnce again, ‘healthcare transformation’ may be A Bridge Too Far but definitely a Long Slog for Oracle. A highly critical Bloomberg report details the flat and deteriorating business of Oracle Health, the division that includes the former Cerner. Since their much-touted acquisition of Cerner two years ago [TTA 14 June 2022], Oracle has not righted the basic health system EHR business. Revenue and clients have stagnated with high-profile losses, versus the massive gains predicted only two years ago, and Cerner falling further behind the hospital/practice EHR leader, Epic, with a 26% hospital bed share compared to Epic’s 48%.\n\nBloomberg’s internal sources indicated that sales reached $5.9 billion in 2023, but are projected to slip to $5.6 billion both in 2024 and 2025.\n\nIn 2023, 12 accounts did not renew and announced they would replace Cerner with Epic. These are major names such as Northwell Health and Boston Children’s Hospital. In 2022, clients with a combined capacity of 4,658 patients were lost, according to KLAS Research. This is despite the fact that EHRs are not moved lightly. The average commitment is 15 years or more since the ramp-up is taxing and costs are astronomical.\n\nCommon complaints cited by KLAS center around Cerner’s legacy software and the Cerner transition: tracking clinical revenue, tool integration, technical glitches, and uncertainty or worsened service associated with the Oracle takeover.Boston moved to improve data exchange with surrounding hospitals and Northwell for Epic’s set of better integrated tools.\n\nOracle laid off many involved with customer accounts. The consulting and sales area laid off 3,000 in one year from March 2023 to February 2024, according to Bloomberg. These may have been as early as May 2023. In June 2023, there were reports that the VA’s pause of Cerner Millenium for at least a year coupled with the completion of MHS Genesis triggered 500 to 1,200 additional Federal service area layoffs plus rescinded job offers. The layoff total may be as high as 4,200 on a pre-acquisition employee base of 28,000, with salaries and promotions frozen. On the executive level, Don Johnson, who once was a successor to CEO Larry Ellison, departed from leading Oracle Health and AI. Reportedly, Dr. David Feinberg, who briefly headed Cerner prior to the sale, is now a ‘ceremonial’ chairman of Oracle Health. [TTA 18 May 2023] Dr. Feinberg also joined Aegis Ventures as a senior advisor and is on Humana’s board, which sounds like a winddown of Oracle responsibilities [TTA 11 Jan]. The layoffs and freezes have improved the former Cerner’s operating margin from 22% to 33%, but not as high as Oracle’s 46% margin.\n\nSince the acquisition and chairman Larry Ellison’s Big Vision promises of creating ‘healthcare transformation’ and ‘better information’, Oracle’s challenge with Cerner has been not only to move their legacy systems onto the cloud but also to integrate Cerner systems with Oracle–and Oracle may have underestimated that complexity as well.\n\nOracle has stated that most customers have been moved to Oracle’s cloud, but inside sources have qualified them as Oracle Health’s smallest and least technically complicated. The big systems with their own domains have yet to be touched.\n\nCerner applications had about 8,000 bugs to be fixed.\n\nOn the people management/integration side, there are substantial differences between ‘legacy’ Cerner and Oracle people, often centering around not understanding the nuances and complexities inherent in healthcare–as well as compensation and working conditions. This Editor, who as a marketer has had to deal peripherally with ‘legacy systems’ (to the point of tears) through acquisitions on the payer side, knows this is common.\n\nWhere Oracle has had success with Cerner’s EHR is in international markets less saturated with EHRs or with home-grown systems, winning contracts in Sweden, the UK and Saudi Arabia. As previously noted, they are a supplier for the NHS. Oracle has moved forward on population health software, modernizing Cerner’s revenue-tracking tool, and planning for an AI-assisted ambient listening voice note system.\n\nWhat remains up in the air is if the VA will restart Millenium transitioning from VistA this year. Oracle is pushing to restart it and its revenue stream this summer as projected last year [TTA 18 May 2023]. This counters VA Secretary Denis McDonough’s testimony last month to the House Veterans Affairs Committee that the VA does not intend to resume deploying it until FY 2025, which does not start until October 2024, and use carryover funding. This FY, there are no funds or plans allocated except for Lovell FHCC, which seems to be going well. The contract, already tightened last April with multiple metrics, demanded improvements, oversight, and annual renewals, is running into more Congressional headwinds this year. Three senators on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee called for the VA “to use the opportunity the new contract structure provides to re-review terms and add additional accountability and oversight provisions to protect veterans and taxpayers.” pointing to the OIG report issued in March. The contract is up for renewal this coming Thursday 16 May. NextGov, Becker’s\n\nThe final burden on Oracle–only alluded to in the article–is the debt load undertaken to finance the $28 billion Cerner acquisition. A complex set of bridge and term loans were used to finance the buy [TTA 27 Oct 2022]. At the time, Oracle’s $90 billion debt load was one of the largest in tech. While Oracle’s stock value has been buoyed by its investments in AI, in the current environment, this debt load becomes suspect. Yahoo Finance, Quartz\n\nSeparation or sale?

Bloomberg and other sources on Monday reported that WBA is now once again searching for buyers for the UK-based Boots pharmacy chain. Earlier reports from end of 2023 into Q1 [TTA 5 March] that it was up for sale were later denied. WBA is at a preliminary stage in working with advisers to seek out some buyers.\n\nThe price will be steep. Boots’ estimated value is £7 billion (about $8.78 billion). One rumored possibility other than a sale is a UK IPO. The news sent WBA shares up by 5% during Monday trading to a close of $18.12. If a sale or spinoff does go through, it will bring to an end an unusual trans-Atlantic alliance for Walgreens, though other than some Boots beauty products in the No. 7 line, there’s little crossover between the two chains, at least here in the US. Reuters, Crain’s Chicago Business\n\nMeanwhile, back in the trenches, Walgreens’ Chicago-area pharmacists wrapped up on Friday a month-long protest at Walgreens’ Deerfield HQ. These actions, which have been rolling since last year, center around increased staff and hour cutbacks plus the rise of telepharmacy. This replaces pharmacists with technicians for filling prescriptions, with patient questions answered by a remote pharmacist via an iPad. Pharmacists represented by the National Pharmacists Association-Laborers’ International Union of North America (NPhA-LIUNA) have been working without a contract since last May. In the past seven years, they have received a 2% wage increase. The local dispute has been mirrored at Walgreens and CVS locations nationwide. Crain’s Chicago Business\n\nShort takes: Medicare telehealth flexibilities may extend; ‘no interest’ in Transcarent sale; NeueHealth ekes out positive net income; Cigna and Oscar break up; DocGo, Ascension cyberattacked (updated)\n\nTwo-year extension of telehealth flexibilities advances in Congress. A small telehealth victory was notched in the House, where the powerful Ways and Means Committee passed the Preserving Telehealth, Hospital, and Ambulance Access Act by a vote of 41-0. The bill would extend many of the Medicare and Federal program telehealth waivers and flexibilities established during the pandemic to the end of 2026. It is now expected that the House will bring the bill to the floor for a full House vote in the fall session. Ways and Means’ jurisdiction is over most financial and revenue-raising Federal measures, such as taxation, Social Security, and Medicare. Highlights of the bill:\n\nGeographic and originating-site waivers\n\nAbility for Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) to continue to furnish telehealth services\n\nExpanded list of eligible Medicare providers, allowing physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech language pathologists, and audiologists to render telehealth services\n\nAbility to offer audio-only services\n\nRepeal of telemental health in-person requirement\n\nPreservation of the Acute Hospital Care at Home Program through CY2029\n\nParts are controversial, such as the telemental in-person requirement, hospice recertification, and guardrails around durable medical equipment (DME) and clinical diagnostics requiring reports to prevent fraud, waste and abuse. The bill did not include remote prescribing of controlled substances. Expect further markups to be made before passage in the House, later in the Senate, and the joint bill. The American Telemedicine Association (ATA) applauded the bill with the main caveat being around telehealth controlled substance prescribing. Full text, FierceHealthcare, ATA release\n\nGlen Tullman rules out a sale of Transcarent–but not an IPO. On the heels of a substantial $126 million in Series D funding and a jumbo $2.2 billion valuation [TTA 8 May], Transcarent’s CEO Tullman, in an interview with MedCityNews, stated that he had “no interest” in selling the company. Transcarent is already run “like a public company”, has a strong leadership team already in place, and “we’ll make any exit decisions for the right reasons.” Mr. Tullman has already run four public companies and IPO’d three: CCC Information Systems (in auto insurance), Livongo, Allscripts (now Veradigm), and Enterprise Systems. Livongo was sold to Teladoc in 2020, with consequences. Veradigm, the former Allscripts, went public in 1999–25 years ago in a vastly different world. Their big bet in enterprise health navigation is now on AI for both physicians and members.\n\nBack to the New Reality, Bizarro World edition. NeueHealth, which is achieving a world record in Dodging Disaster while paying out leadership bonuses, eked out a decent Q1. The former Bright Health Group managed to squeak out revenue of $245.1 million, operational net income of $5.7 million, and an adjusted EBITDA of $2.5 million compared to a Q1 2023 loss of $5.7 million. This doesn’t mean it was profitable because its net income for Q1 was a negative $28.5 million. Revenue dropped by 18%–$55 million–compared to Q1 2023. New Enterprise Associates (NEA) must be pleased, as they are now 60% owner of the operation with another loan of $30 million secured by penny warrants [TTA 16 Apr]. The full year guidance was reaffirmed at $1 billion in revenue with 70% coming from its NeueSolutions business (their management services for ACOs and IPAs), and adjusted EBITDA between $15 million and $25 million. What remains, of course, are the UXBs–the problems with their financial reporting as noted in their 2023 results and that ever-so-nasty $400 million in payments due to CMS in March 2025, as well as to Texas on their exited ACA plans. But NeueHealth has played both ends against the middle and tied up creditors in Gordian knots for a couple of years, so why not keep on keepin’ on for now? Release, earnings call transcript, FierceHealthcare TTA 5 April\n\nThe much-touted partnership of big Cigna and insurtech Oscar Health is breaking up. The Cigna + Oscar joint program covers the small group business. As of the end of Q1, it had 61,428 members enrolled. The program, which had no forecast of profitability, will end in 2025. CEO Mark Bertolini’s statement was rather forceful in this regard. Oscar is shifting to marketing ICHRA, or individual coverage health reimbursement arrangements that permit small businesses to offer employees individual health plans subsidized by employer contributions. Cigna will continue to offer plans for the small and midsize group market. Becker’s\n\nCyberattacks strike DocGo, Ascension Health. DocGo reported a data breach in its 7 May Form 8-K filed with the SEC. It involved a limited but unspecified amount of protected health information (PHI) of patients using its ambulance services, but was confined only to that. No other report of the breach has been made. This followed a positive Q1 report of revenue up to $192.1 million, from $113 million in the same quarter 2023. Net income was $10.6 million versus last year’s net loss of $3.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA went up to $24.1 million versus $5.6 million. DocGo provides telehealth/RPM, mobile urgent care, disease management, and medical transportation services. It recently lost its lucrative but controversial NYC migrant service contract but retains city Health + Hospitals contracts and some smaller housing service contracts. Mobihealthnews Ascension Health, on the other hand, has had a serious disruption in some clinical operations affecting an undisclosed number of hospitals and systems, but was reported in Michigan. On Wednesday, Ascension detected unusual activity in select technology-network systems. They advised business partners to sever connections to their systems and have brought in Mandiant to assist in investigation and remediation efforts. Ascension is one of the largest health systems in the US, with 140 hospitals in 19 states plus the District of Columbia. Healthcare Finance, Detroit Free Press, Ascension website\n\nAscension Update: Reports since yesterday are now far more exact. Its EHR, MyChart, several systems for ordering tests and medications, plus some phone systems are unavailable across the system. Some appointments and surgeries have been postponed. There are emergency diversions of care in some locations. Ascension’s statements to media has been that ‘downtime procedures’ will be in place ‘for some time’. There is no timeline given for restoration. Becker’s, Healthcare Dive\n\nNews roundup: Transcarent raises $126M; 98point6 lays off; Oscar notches first profit; Steward Health’s Ch. 11; Amazon Clinic GM leaves; Amwell’s down but hopeful Q1; Hims founder gets political\n\nA study in contrasts\n\nAlready well-funded Transcarent gains another $126 million in a Series D round. Total outside funding is $424 million that boosts its valuation to $2.2 billion. This round will fund expansion and development efforts plus enhancing the platform’s AI capabilities. The Series D round was led by General Catalyst and Glen Tullman’s 7wireVentures, with participation from new investors Memorial Hermann Health System and Geodesic Capital, along with existing investors. As noted in our Rock Health analysis (but not in the company’s release), this raise had a ‘sweetener’ of a 2.5x return should the company IPO or M&A. Transcarent is an enterprise health navigator that enables employees to use a single platform to navigate their needs for medical, surgery, pharmacy, and mental health care. Transcarent’s differentiator in this space for large self-insured employers is that Transcarent steers employees to higher quality, lower cost care settings. Their pricing is also based on actual users only in risk-based agreements, versus the more common per member per month (PMPM) care management model. Transcarent also pays health systems up front for surgical procedures.\n\nTullman, who is also Transcarent’s CEO, is well known for creating high profile companies that eventually are sold or IPO’d for high valuations. These deals make his followers money, but often not the buyers (ask Teladoc) or the employees left in the lurch. This Editor does wonder, given the state of US business right now, how this competitive enterprise care management niche earns this kind of investment and valuation. Release, Mobihealthnews\n\nOne of Transcarent’s buys last year was 98point6’s virtual care and related assets that included 98point6’s physician group, self-insured employer business, and an irrevocable software license in a deal worth potentially $100 million according to publicity. 98point6 then had a well publicized and $32 million-financed pivot to being a software company and licensor, acquiring remaining assets from asynchronous telehealth provider Bright.md this past January for 55% in equity and 45% in cash. Despite all this, little noted was that at the end of April was that 98point6 laid off an undisclosed number of its estimated 100 US-based staff. One wonders if this affects service to Bright.md’s provider customers. GeekWire\n\nOn the health plan side, rebooted insurtech Oscar Health finally got into the black with $177.4 million in net income for Q1 and beat earnings per share estimates. It’s no surprise to those of us who’ve followed the modus operandi of Mark Bertolini, who took the reins a year ago March [TTA 30 Mar 2023] and stated at the time that his focus was moving Oscar to profitability. Total revenue was $2.1 billion, a 46% increase versus Q1 2023, driven primarily by higher membership, rate increases, and lower risk adjustment as a percentage of premiums. Release. Becker’s, FierceHealthcare Their full 2024 is projected at $8.3 to $8.4 billion in revenue, $125 to $175 million in adjusted EBIDTA. Oscar solely offers ACA exchange plans for individuals and small groups, having exited Medicare Advantage after 2022. Release\n\nSteward Health Care filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy on 6 May. As forecast when the company moved to sell its provider group Stewardship Health to Optum [TTA 18 Apr], Steward’s debt load in its 31 hospitals and operations forced the restructuring on Monday. What’s owed: $1.2 billion in total loan debts, about $6.6 billion in long-term lease payments, north of $600 million to 30 of its largest lenders (Change Healthcare, Philips North America LLC, Medline Industries, AYA Healthcare and Cerner). There’s $289.8 million in unpaid compensation obligations: $68 million to its own workers in unpaid employee salaries, $105.6 million in payments for physician services and $47.7 million owed to staffing agencies. Topping it off–$979.4 million outstanding in trade obligations, of which approximately 70% are over 120 days past due.\n\nDebtor-in-possession is now Medical Properties Trust (MPT) which will finance $75 million up front extending to $225 million more if Steward’s asset selloff milestones are completed on time. MPT will need to be far more forthcoming about Steward’s finances than Steward has been. The Stewardship Health sale to Optum now has to pass through the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas as well as Massachusetts regulators. Becker’s, Healthcare Dive 6 May, 7 May\n\nAmazon Clinic loses its general manager, Nworah Ayogu, MD. He departed for Thrive Capital, a secretive VC (based on its website) that invests in technology, internet, and software companies. Dr. Ayogu, who doubled as chief medical officer of Amazon Pharmacy, stated the move will enable him to focus “exclusively on healthcare” after nearly four years with Amazon. He launched Clinic in November 2022 to a full 50-state rollout of the asynchronous and synchronous telehealth service last August, after a privacy challenge that escalated to the Senatorial level and forced a rollout delay [TTA 1 Aug 2023]. It sounds more like the doctor needs to go on a break. Amazon has not announced a replacement nor has Thrive issued any information. Becker’s, Modern Healthcare\n\nAmwell’s soft Q1 reflective of telehealth as a whole. Its Q1 revenue of $59.5 million was 7% below Q1 2023’s $64 million, and missed Mr. Market’s forecasts. Where there was improvement was that net loss narrowed considerably to $73.4 million from prior year’s $398.5 million, when it took a hefty non-cash goodwill impairment charge. The bright spot Amwell is forecasting is that their Federal contract with Defense Health Agency, jointly with Leidos, will impact by Q4. Their part of the Digital First initiative for the Military Health System (MHS) will replace the current system, MHS Video Connect, with Amwell Converge [TTA 15 May]. Their pending NYSE stock delisting they plan to remedy with a reverse stock split to be announced. Healthcare Dive, Amwell’s SEC Form 10-Q\n\nHims CEO and founder Andrew Dudum Does a Dumb. Mr. Dudum made a statement that on X that was interpreted by most to be encouraging the disruptive anti-Israel university and elsewhere protests which have roiled cities like New York and Los Angeles for weeks and are canceling graduations at Columbia University and University of Southern California. A statement like “If you’re currently protesting against the genocide of the Palestinian people & for your university’s divestment from Israel, keep going. It’s working.” and went on to say that companies would be eager to hire them is plain and clear. It immediately garnered criticism from investment group, industry, and software heads, as well as conservative and moderate media. This Editor will put on her marketing cap and remind Mr. Dudum of Marketing 101–be memorable, but do not offend the customer or investors who give you money. You have, after all, a company that depends upon appealing to a wide spectrum of people with easy and recurring telehealth prescriptions for hair loss, weight loss, skin problems, women’s health concerns, and erectile dysfunction. Your statement was not only completely unnecessary but also inflammatory at a bad time–it offended many customers no matter what religion or beliefs. Stock dropped. Customers canceled. Note to Mr. Dudum: if you want a thriving business, don’t live up to your name. FoxBusiness"
