      "# [98point6 Technologies on 2024-03-08](https://www.98point6.com/platform/)\nAsynchronous care, or “async,” is a type of virtual care with no scheduling requirements, giving the patient the flexibility and convenience to seek care for non-urgent concerns whenever and wherever they’d like. Whereas a response from a provider may occur quickly, there is no real-time interaction between the patient and the medical staff. This type of dedicated care also helps with capturing revenue by incorporating patient messages from a provider’s inbox back into the patient chart to enhance the continuity of care. 98point6 can support your clinicians in asynchronously diagnosing and treating more than 140 common conditions for patients across all ages—from pediatrics to geriatrics.\n\nOur AI-powered solution leverages evidence-based clinical content, machine learning, and automation to recommend the optimal care option, while also giving patients the ability to choose the format they prefer. Customizable to the specific workflow of the healthcare organization, the clinician can direct the patient to real-time care or prompt them to seek in-person care if their medical concern cannot be treated asynchronously.\n\nReal-time virtual care can consist of text-based messaging, audio, or video interactions, or any combination of the three. Additionally, real-time care can be facilitated as an on-demand or scheduled visit. On-demand visits allow patients to immediately start a visit, any time, from anywhere. Patients can report symptoms and concerns and our product gathers relevant history, before connecting the patient to a clinician. Wait times in the queue are dependent on clinician availability. Scheduled visits allow patients to choose a date and time in the future that is most convenient for them.\n\nOur patient intake automates much of the administrative tasks associated with taking a history. Our product is trained, based on millions of patient encounters, to respond to patient-reported symptoms with question sets, written by physicians, that elicit relevant clinical details for provider review. It works like this: the patient enters their chief complaint as free text. They can write as much or as little as they want to communicate the reason for their visit and their symptoms. The 98point6 platform intakes all of that information and then generates the appropriate follow-up questions.\n\nOur patient intake process significantly reduces the administrative burden on clinicians – and automatically captures an accurate transcript of patient-reported symptoms.\n\nWe have been applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to medical encounters since 2015. As a result, we have a vast data set that is one-of-a-kind in the field of natural language processing for medical applications. We utilize Al and machine learning to improve both efficiency and medical quality by automating time-consuming tasks, allowing clinicians to focus their judgment on key decision points in the clinical encounter. Our system provides information and actions for the clinician to consider; however, the clinician is in complete control of the visit diagnosis, and care planning.\n\nData integration is cornerstone to the 98point6 platform. EMR data can be automatically pulled into the clinician console, and once the visit is complete, data is automatically sent to the EMR to be recorded in the patient’s medical record. Our standards-based integration supports Epic and Cerner, as well as other EMRs. The platform also supports data integrations for analytics, reporting, security and compliance and other administrative needs.",

As part of the deal, hundreds of 98point6 enterprise customers including Boeing, Kindercare and Banner|Aetna employing millions of eligible members will have access to an even wider selection of primary and behavioral health services through Transcarent. The newly emerged 98point6 Technologies plans to remain solely focused on licensing its software to third-party health care providers such as MultiCare Health System, the first to license the 98point6 Technology Platform within its hybrid ambulatory care platform, Indigo Health.\n\n“Our evolution to 98point6 Technologies answers the need for purpose-built technology created by physicians, for physicians, and is the culmination of work our front-line team of clinicians spent years perfecting,” said Jay Burrell, President and Chief Executive Officer of 98point6 Technologies. “This comes at a time when every provider in the health services industry is on an urgent mission to remain competitive in what has become an increasingly crowded and undifferentiated marketplace.”\n\nIn today’s market, demand for telehealth services has stabilized at 38 times higher than pre-pandemic levels and healthcare providers are scrambling to catch up, citing telehealth implementation as a top challenge. According to new research only 13% of hospitals and health systems consider themselves ahead of the pace of change that patients expect and new market rivals are setting, and only 11% of health systems report being in the implementation phase of their personalized care and digital transformation journeys.\n\nHealth systems recognize they must move quickly to solidify their brand presence and physical footprint, starting with the expansion of their ambulatory care business and introduction of new technology and consumer-centered services. Gartner’s Hype Cycle for Healthcare Providers, 2022 corroborated the shift, stating “we see greater provider interest and focus on virtual care and total experience to meet clinical and business demands.”\n\nTechnology Built to Give Health Care Providers a Competitive Edge\n\nThe 98point6 Technology Platform provides a turn-key, cloud-based solution for scaling up a virtual care operation complete with software, professional services and support from a team who built and operated a successful, nationwide virtual clinic for the past several years. The platform provides a quick and cost effective way to create new revenue opportunities, better support the workforce, improve care and boost the bottom line. Implementation includes a client-branded app and assistance in configuring the platform.\n\n“Our strategic partnership with 98point6 will help us scale our digital capabilities to meet community demand and bring a new level of meaningful engagement to our customers,” said Ryan Fix, President of Retail Health at MultiCare.\n\nAt the heart of the 98point6 Technology Platform is a web-based Clinician Console, which encapsulates a refined set of best practices designed to help providers deliver high quality virtual care based on years of clinical experience. Built-in logic in the form of artificial intelligence (AI) and automated practice standards guide providers to quickly make the right medical decisions or recommend in-person care when needed. This level of automation limits care variability, optimizes patient time by streamlining the intake process and reduces cognitive load on the provider to support top-of-licensure practice.\n\nThe 98point6 Technology Platform includes:\n\nA standalone digital clinic hosted in the cloud, including AI-powered patient engagement, workflow and EHR integration, care follow-up and documentation.\n\nWeb-based Clinician Console for providers to conduct visits.\n\nAn SDK to create a fully-branded patient experience.\n\nTraining and development for clinicians and staff.\n\nEngagement marketing support to activate new users and drive utilization.\n\nWorkforce management guidance to help define hybrid staffing and scheduling plans.\n\nFor more information on 98point6 Technologies, visit 98point6.com.\n\nAbout 98point6 Technologies\n\n98point6 Technologies builds and licenses software to power exceptional virtual care experiences for providers and patients based on years of clinical use across millions of patients.

      "# [Transcarent to Acquire 98point6 AI-Powered Virtual Care Platform and Care Business on 2023-03-06](https://www.98point6.com/press_release/press-release_2023-03-06/)\nCare Business includes over 100 mid-size and larger self-insured employers, leading health systems, and innovative payors who use 98point6 as their consumer interface More than 3 million health consumers have access to the 98point6 Virtual Care Platform Palo Alto, CA, March 6, 2023 – Transcarent, a health and care experience company that makes it easy for people to access high-quality, affordable care announced plans to acquire the leading AI-powered virtual care platform and care business of on-demand primary care company, 98point6. The acquisition gives Transcarent access to the leading AI-powered virtual care technology and an affiliated medical group of providers skilled at delivering high quality, on-demand care. Since 2015, 98point6 has been the acknowledged leader in using AI to create quality, personalized text-based care experiences for people while significantly improving physician productivity. The agreement will provide current 98point6 self-insured enterprise customers, health systems, and payors easy access to Transcarent’s comprehensive health and care experience platform including EveryDay Care, Pharmacy Care, Care@Home, Surgery Care, and Complex Care. The transaction is expected to close March 31st, after which 98point6 Technologies will continue to develop innovative technology solutions and focus its efforts on licensing its 98point6 Technology Platform software to third-party health care providers. “In healthcare, complexity is the problem and simplicity is the answer. Transcarent is committed to creating an easy-to-use health and care experience that people love, that improves care, and that reduces the cost of that care,” said Transcarent Chief Executive Officer, Glen Tullman. “By combining the 98point6 AI-powered virtual care technology and an affiliated group of world class physicians with Transcarent’s comprehensive care platform, we will deliver consumers and employers what they really want and need. Leveraging AI to drive personalization and access to care will revolutionize the virtual care experience, for the first time combining best in class technology with human touch. That’s a winning combination.” “We can think of no better company to continue nurturing our customers and Members than Transcarent as we enter our next phase of growth, which will focus on software licensing under the 98point6 Technologies brand,” said Jay Burrell, President and Chief Executive Officer of 98point6 Technologies. “Virtual care is the bedrock of health care. We remain committed to innovating new technology solutions and business models that work upstream to give health care providers the infrastructure they need to succeed with consumers.” The 98point6 acquisition is the latest step in Transcarent’s journey to design a health and care experience for health consumers while aligning with the organizations that pay for that care. Transcarent’s acquisition of 98point6’s industry leading care technology and the ability to closely partner with an affiliated provider group will complement its in-house capabilities and partnerships with top local providers and health systems across a full spectrum of virtual and in-person care, providing a more personalized Member health and care experience that integrates across solutions. Transcarent Members will have the flexibility to opt into a best-in-class, text based virtual clinic experience including on-demand access to high quality primary care anytime and anywhere in the United States, with direct access to follow-on specialty care at home or in their local communities from our provider partners including many of the leading health systems across the country. This transaction also strengthens our relationships with some of the most innovative payors in the country who are embracing innovative technologies to offer more consumer directed care. “At Banner|Aetna, we strive to do everything possible to keep our members healthy, and that includes offering them the gold standard in virtual care through 98point6,” said Tom Grote, CEO of Banner|Aetna. “I’m confident that Transcarent, supported by 98point6 Technologies, will continue to meet that high bar, and look forward to learning about other services we can potentially fold into our health plan to exceed our members’ expectations.”\n\nAbout Transcarent\n\nTranscarent is a health and care experience company that makes it easy for people to access high quality, affordable care.

      "# Post ID bg7ip2: Internet medicine is awesome, 98point6 was so so helpful for me with +60 score by [(FrugalChef13, Reddit, 2019-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/)\n**TL;DR- $20 got me an awesome appointment with a nice doctor and a prescription for a medication I could afford that solved my issue.**\n\n*Disclaimer: This particular thing worked well for me so I'm going to tell you about it. Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I'm not compensated or connected to the website I'm discussing.*\n\nSo like a lot of people on here I'm usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it's underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I've got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I'd run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn't been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn't, it's weird.\n\nSo I was fucked.  Can't sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can't afford the $100+ for a doctor's appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there's a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\n\nSo I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It's $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I'm drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I'm still in bad shape tomorrow morning it's worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\n\nGuys, it was amazing.  It's not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I'd already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn't help.  She was so kind, and didn't make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor's appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it's faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can't prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I'd taken in the past wasn't an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What's the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\n\nUsually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it's what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you'll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can't estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\n\nThis amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I'll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn't shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that's a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\n\nI would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It's not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it's a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\n\nIf anyone else has recommendations or critiques or thoughts on internet medicine stuff I'd love to hear it.\n\n## Comment ID elj1h0o with +7 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/elj1h0o/) (in reply to ID bg7ip2):\nThat sounds like a great resource!

Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.\n\nA prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\n\nControlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\n\nSo the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.  Neither medication can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor, but Vicodin is super extra hard to get prescribed.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nEDIT: I tried to clarify the original post to make it more obvious that although she couldn't prescribe the thing I'd taken in the past, she did prescribe a thing that helped a lot.  It actually helped even more than the thing I'd taken in the past and without making me drowsy, which is AWESOME!\n\n#### Comment ID elkh6df with +3 score by [(Mr_Fuzzo, Reddit, 2019-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/elkh6df/) (in reply to ID eljx9uw):\nControlled substances, for the un-initiated are medications like opiates, barbiturates, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, etc.\n\nSo, meds like Xanax, OxyContin, Ritalin, etc.\n\n#### Comment ID eljy54o with +2 score by [(AnotherDay_RS, Reddit, 2019-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/eljy54o/) (in reply to ID eljx9uw):\nThat's great!!

A friendly return desk person told me that I could simply buy a new item on discount, then return it immediately and they would refund the higher price - effectively letting me buy the item at a discount.\n\n### Comment ID i5g6z6p with +27 score by [(mynameroro, Reddit, 2022-04-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/u7mkpr/most_underrated_costco_benefit/i5g6z6p/) (in reply to ID i5fsgxj):\nThis also works if you KNOW something is going to go on sale in the next 30 days but also likely to sell out quickly.

They will try to fill it for me once if they can get in touch with the person who prescribed in to me, but idk if that's actually going to happen. I might try to transfer my prescription elsewhere but the only other pharmacy anywhere near me is a CVS and from what I've seen, they also don't fill many telehealth prescriptions for controlled substances. \n\nAnd yeah, I understand caution with controlled substances, but it's really weird to me that if any other certified provider had prescribed this, it would have been fine, but because it was a certified provider online it's not ok???

Words can’t describe how much I hate that stupid company. I’d recommend calling your primary care provider and explaining the situation. Most of the time they can write it as long as you can show a diagnosis and proof you’ve taken it before. \n\nThat’ll also protect you from losing your prescription when the pandemic exemption eventually expires— it’s a general rule for controlled substances that you need at least one in-person meeting with the doctor before they can fill it. I think some places don’t require this, but AFAIK it was a requirement pre-2020. I know they did also always require the person who prescribed it to be in-state back then as well. \n\nAt least they stopped requiring you to physically deliver HANDWRITTEN prescriptions.

I love the simplicity and often lower cost of telehealth, but I honestly wonder if they ever decline to give out a prescription. If you want Adderall, you just pay the online provider and get a script. There are even telehealth services for testosterone replacement therapy prescribing 200mg of testosterone to 19 year old kids who basically want legal anabolic steroids. I've seen guys with testosterone levels of 800pg/dL getting TRT scripts for quadruple the normal dosage. While some providers may be acting responsibly, there are countless services that are not.\n\nAdderall works great for a lot of people, there are plenty of people that depend on it. It is also a dangerous stimulant that is wickedly over-prescribed. I can understand the pharmacy having hesitations about this. In the not-so-distant past, it was opioids being handed out like candy. We are approaching a similar situation with psychostimulants.\n\n\n\n#### Comment ID isw0m6l with +1 score by [(Random_182f2565, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/isw0m6l/) (in reply to ID isu7f5c):\nIsn't that just bad faith tho?\n\n#### Comment ID isx707b with +1 score by [(NegotiationTx, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/isx707b/) (in reply to ID isu7f5c):\nThey can ef off with that policy.

Basically pill mills started up, and doctors at them would write scripts for millions of pills for \"patients\" all over the country that they could never have possibly seen. So as a response Walgreens (and CVS, I believe), the two largest pharmacy chains in the US, have instituted a policy that if you are presenting a new script, the prescriber is not local, and you've not been on the medication before, the pharmacist can, and usually will require that they speak to the doctor to confirm the script, dosage, and DX before dispensing the drug. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get telehealth can be a good thing, but for psychoactive medication that can be abused like stimulants, I think what Walgreens and CVS are doing is a reasonable control mechanism on  MDs/DOs/PAs/APNs just writing scripts like crazy.\n\n#### Comment ID isvvl0w with +4 score by [(Tragically_Fantastic, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/isvvl0w/) (in reply to ID isve0mi):\nI do think it's an ok policy, but basically what this pharmacist said was if they can get in touch with my prescriber, they'll fill it one time, but after that they won't do it again, which feels kinda backwards to me?

I have not had one ounce of ill will or trouble from anyone at Mayo, and I can just go to their pharmacy and get my Rx filled. The worst part is waiting between appointments... The journey from initial consult to CBT appointments and then confirmation with a psych eval and prescribing meds took about a year, not because they were unsure, but because the calendars were (and remain) pretty well booked up. Side note: I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder (recurrent), and that's why I had CBT appointments mixed in there. They had to rule out anxiety before ADHD, but the doc smartly suggested the ADHD was leading to my anxiety, so he is treating the ADHD first.

I promise we aren’t trying to make life miserable for you. I have adhd too. We have a duty to fill a prescription “in good faith” - I can lose my license otherwise. Example: There are 2 providers from telehealth that I see hundreds and hundreds of Adderall rx from - from their FL, CO, and CA office. I do not see them prescribe *anything* except Adderall. At all. That is a massive red flag for me. They have also (confirmed) never met with any of their patients in person. Another red flag. \n\nI can also understand that seeing a doctor in person is difficult for some people and their schedules- I have to schedule an appt once every 3 months in person myself and it is very difficult with my unpredictable schedule. Bottom line is our license and livelihood is on the line. I think of telehealth as a non-permanent solution while establishing a provider in your community.\n\nLastly, with so many rx now coming from telehealth we are hitting our max of many stimulants that we can order from the DEA on a monthly basis. I cannot take care of our current clientele with the massive influx - we already hit our DEA limit as it is. I usually suggest folks try another pharmacy in a more suburban area (we are urban and Adderall-sense) so you don’t have to go weeks without your medication. \n\nAlso as some others have mentioned, C2s cannot be transferred so you will need to have your prescriber send in a new rx to the pharmacy at which you want to have it filled. \n\nWe’re also extremely understaffed which complicates everything. Please be nice to us. It is hell on earth at most pharmacies right now. \n\n**I would suggest doing mail order pharmacy to get your med (Amazon has a pharmacy) or any independent pharmacy in your area.** I hope this helps clarify some misunderstandings.\n\n### Comment ID isyt1l9 with +2 score by [(Tragically_Fantastic, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/isyt1l9/) (in reply to ID isyqlmt):\nYeah, I understand that.

It used to be sooo easy with my psychiatrist. Dr. Awesome would prescribe my meds for 90 days. So I would call her once every 3 months and l would... get this... only have to leave her a message. All her phone calls went directly to voice mail. And if I left her with my name, meds refilled and phone number to reach me I would get a notification 1 hour later that she sent my script in. I would see her in person every six months as a general check up. So fucking easy. \n\nBut she retired... now i go to my practioner because I'm fucking stable! (Honestly super proud of that accomplishment) however, this new doctor can't prescribe them for 90 days only 30. So every month I have to remember to call their office. Explain to the person on the phone what I need. That yes I have two meds with the same name. I've been through this routine so many times I can pronounce dexemethlyfenidate. She passes it along to the doctor. Doctor approves it and after two days if the pharmacy doesn't call me I have to call them to make sure it got pushed through. Wait another day. Now it takes them a week or so to figure out billing me. By the time they do bill me I forget about it and it ends up getting close to being over due. I pay the bill.

I wonder if its a blessing in disguise for some people. Guys if you are going through this, do not let it stress you. This is what I did, now be prepared because it is going to sound cheesy because I am a very cheesy person... When Walgreens made me wait 3 weeks for my newly prescribed telehealth Adderall 10mgs during the last few weeks of school (including finals), it made me feel like... worse than poop. I will admit when I got the RX, I had the most surreal sense of calm and peace. Like finally my war was over and I could be treated like a normal person. I didn't have to seek illegal alternatives anymore and feel like a criminal. I could finally get help for my issues and my life was about to improve dramatically. Then doubt crept in, I am not worth this RX, I am not worth getting better, I am a criminal, I am a bad person. I do not deserve to be high functioning like my friends and family. I deserve to live the life I am living. (Obviously have self-esteem issues) With all this thinking floating around in my head, I called Walgreens to see if they ahd received my medication, and this started the whole awkward \"Oh, the medication is on back-order and we do not know when it will be in.\" If a pharmacy wants to fill your RX, the alternative to this wil be \"Oh, your medication is not in stock but go ahead and get your RX sent in so we can get it in stock ASAP.\" There is no such thing as just telling a patient who has been prescribed a medication by a licensed physician that their medication is just not available with no explanation. I did not know this though. It took me weeks to learn this. I thought the medication was really out of stock! It took calling other pharmacies and hearing the condescending tone in their nvoice that made me realize this was a catch all resposne to telehealth prescriptions. They even started denying the other script that I had been getting for over 5 years through telehealth! (Suboxone - huge deal to be cut off).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was so down in the dumps. Then I was taught a new method of thinking by a person I look up to. I started ending all the negative shit. I started saying positive stuff to myself to build myself up... \"You are a pre-med student and will get any treatment you need for any illness you are diagnosed with.\" I looked on reddit for pharmacies that other students of UCF were using and not having trouble getting their rX'S filled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI basically changed up my thinking and if I got a negative response from a pharmacy (I did, a few times...) I simply acted confused (Because deep down I was anyways)... If someone treats you in a way you know for a fact you do not deserve, do not get upset back at them, do not get upset period... It is okay to show confusion, which is justified. Acting confused changed up the dynamics so much that a few pharmacy techs even explained to me what was actually going on, Walgreens had decided to implement a policy where the prescribing doctor had to be within a 30 mile radius of the patient and had seen the patient in the last year. Other pharmacies were following their lead. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a good person. I do however have ADHD. I deserve treatment. I deserve to be treated with respect. Trust me, okay, there is a way to get your RX filled. It may not be through Walgreens, but there is a way if you keep up your spirits and be true to what you deserve. Do not use this as an excuse to get frustrated and head back to the streets for illegal adderall. Fight for your own prescription!!!!  \n\n\nI ended up getting mine filled at a Costco, a pharamcy which has been deemed to be problematic for telehealth prescriptions. However I did not have one single problem with them and they treated me like a decent human being. Yes its 1 hour from my house, but I will gladly pass all the pharmacies that literally are 100% fine with prescribing 1,000,000s of lethal Oxycontin pills but not 1 helpful stimulant or OUD MAT therapy.\n\n## Comment ID j6dvo6h with +1 score by [(PenaltyParticular909, Reddit, 2023-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/j6dvo6h/) (in reply to ID y7elk6):\nThat's why I stopped going to Big box pharmacies because they're always looking at you sideways like they don't drink their bottles of wine as soon as they get home.

If you're not spending much each year, it's your best option. If you're worried about catastrophic scenarios, the HSA does have a maximum out-of-pocket of $6,500, so you won't have to pay more than that in any given year. The only reason you might look at the other plans is if you fall somewhere in between.\n\nAs for your concern about \"too good to be true\", the reality is that for the company, it's still the cheapest option even with the annual HSA contribution since few will hit that maximum unless there is a catastrophic health event.

Making sure that you put that premium savings into the HSA via paycheck contributions and use it to pay for medical expenses, you'll at least break even with the Traditional plans.\n\nHIgh deductible health plans save companies money because people mentally don't consider annual healthcare expenses to be a sunk cost and will forego care because they are scared of the first couple bills before they meet their deductible when in reality if they had other plans that money would be spent on premiums regardless of their healthcare needs.\n\nThere is advice out there not to choose a HDHP if one is having a baby that year or anticipates a lot of healthcare expenses, but that is actually not generally the thing to do based on how Boeing prices the plans.",

I knew exactly what was wrong with me and was under the care of a specialist. After more than three months of conservative treatment, my symptoms were continuing to worsen so we decided to do surgery and just fixed it. Insurance denied it three times. Finally, the day before my scheduled surgery and on the third denial, my arm stopped feeling like it was connected to my brain and was basically a heavy sack of meat. My doctor advised me to go to the ER for the hospital where he consults. It took four hours for the NP at the ER  to call him-after additional tests and meds I didn’t need. They did finally admit me, though, and insurance was finally like “ok, I guess you can have surgery to prevent permanent nerve damage.”  Insurance is a scam.\n\n#### Comment ID f6enmsx with +38 score by [(Melipuffles, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6enmsx/) (in reply to ID f6drvm8):\nUgh, I had chest pains back in February and went to an urgent care because I was pretty sure it was anxiety caused and they sent me to the ER and I got charged $800 after insurance for them to take some bloodwork and scans and go “yeah it’s most likely anxiety.” \n\nI was just hoping to get a refill of some anxiety medication I’ve used in the past, but because I take birth control they said it could’ve been a clot and rushed me to the ER.\n\n#### Comment ID f6dt6sl with +31 score by [(grapholalia, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6dt6sl/) (in reply to ID f6drvm8):\nI'm aware, but I was also in insane amounts of pain and talked to my sister (who is a nurse), and she advised me to go to the ER with my symptoms.

A regular gp can do it, but if the results indicate an issue you really need a specialist to diagnose what type and treat it. Look into state funded insurance or low income federal,  because you will need it. Unfortunately autoimmune disease is not so unlike cancer in that it can be very life threatening and won't generally improve on its own. I have heard of some people getting some relief by following an autoimmune diet where high inflammation foods like nightshades and refined carbohydrates are avoided, but it's only complimentary to treatment obviously.

Although from the sound of it it's likely some other underlying problem, but this could help a bit in the meantime.\n\n#### Comment ID f6h1aju with +2 score by [(poodlepunk0907, Reddit, 2019-11-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6h1aju/) (in reply to ID f6dg8m6):\nHey there’s a ton of comments so you may not see this but for a while I was getting a T O N of canker sores out of nowhere; like you, I would have several at once and was hurting all the time. One thing that helped me is those cough drops with actual numbing medicine in them - Cepacol is the brand, I think. They’re a little on the pricey side for cough drops (like $5ish I think for a pack of 16 or so?) but were a godsend towards the end of a rough day when I was simply at my wit’s end with the pain. Definitely not ideal, but not too bad if you use them sparingly for when you really can’t stand it.\n\nI also later found out I got more prone to them because I was prone to dry mouth - which, funny enough, was a side effect of a medication I was taking. I started using that biotene stuff regularly and drinking a TON of water and it really helped. Your sores might be due to any number of things, but if they’re related to dry mouth, that’d be pretty easy to determine and then relatively easy to fix. \n\nI’m so sorry you’re going through this, canker sores hurt SO much and any health issue without answers is maddening. Hope you’re hanging in there ok.\n\n#### Comment ID f6h3fde with +2 score by [(eraser-dust, Reddit, 2019-11-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6h3fde/) (in reply to ID f6dg8m6):\nI've been there.  I had to alter my diet to low acid and gluten-free and quit using toothpastes with sulfates in them.  I used to get extremely painful canker sores constantly.  Ever since removing foods that upset my stomach as well as my mouth and quitting sulfates, my canker sores went away.  Might be something to check into if you can since it's something you can proactively do.

You take the capsule, crack it open, and mix the powdered drug with water. It worked wonders at clearing them up. You could also crack one open and put it right on there and cover with a cotton ball or anything to keep the taste off of your tongue. \n\nNot sure how helpful this is without be able to get your hands on a prescription but just an idea if you're there anyway.

Brush your teeth with baking soda at night before bed. Swishing baking soda water around your mouth during the day will also help too. \n\nIf you have a night where you know you can sleep in, plan to sleep as long as possible. I would even say take a benedryl or some cheaper sleep time aid just so you’re relaxed for a long time. Don’t do this regularly though because the ingredient in it means your brain doesn’t dream as much as it normally should do overtime you’ll feel more exhausted. For me I feel best if once a week I sleep for 10+ hours but that’s just me. If I’m not sleeping enough, it’s usually I need to wash my bedsheets or something. \n\nGood luck and honestly see where you can rearrange your schedule for your health, overlap days off if needed or be on that hunt for the elusive better paying job.\n\n### Comment ID f6e5gxn with +4 score by [(FiggNewton, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6e5gxn/) (in reply to ID f6dwhur):\nI take benedryl for everything.

HOWEVER, the er does not exist to diagnose, they don't exist to do anything past make sure that if you are in serious trouble, you can walk out of the er without that critical problem. \n\ni understand your back pain was absolutely terrible, but if they didn't find any life-threatening causes for it, they really don't have the time or space to diagnose something that has a myriad of causes that are not life-threatening. i know that sucks, it's part of the system we keep voting to maintain, but it's the truth. besides getting you hooked on pain medication, they can't do anything about your back pain, and keeping you longer in an attempt to diagnose would have shot your bill up like crazy when even a specialist wouldn't cost so much. \n\ni'm really sorry your experiences have turned you off to healthcare so much, but please know that family practice doctors don't make enough money to pay off their student loans, and usually live in loan-based poverty for 10+ years after becoming a doctor- they're not there for the money, they're there because they truly do care about their patients. i'm so incredibly sorry you didn't get to experience that.\n\n#### Comment ID f6fboxg with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6fboxg/) (in reply to ID f6edv3c):\n[deleted]\n\n## Comment ID f6dhio5 with +5 score by [(mcnicfer, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6dhio5/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nDon’t take this as medical advice, but have you googled at home treatments for canker sores?

There are other services like that and they are legitimate actual qualified services, it's what I'd use first because I have a high deductible plan since I'm generally pretty healthy. They don't charge you if they can't help you\n\nAnother edit: if I lost insurance i also have access to this no insurance clinic. As a single person I'd pay an 80 dollar monthly fee and then you can go for anything you might need whether it's check ups, physicals, or urgent care. This type of service is popping up more and more and becoming popular to combat expensive insurance policies.\n\n## Comment ID f6dzinp with +2 score by [(lurklurklurky, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6dzinp/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nI used to get canker sores regularly as a kid - when I switched to a toothpaste without sodium laurel sulfate in it, it reduced my canker sores dramatically to where I barely get them anymore - the brand I use is Sensodyne.

Even though I’m not. And when I try to tell my SO that I’m suffering, he just says ‘you need to stop being so depressed and get into a hobby.’ Then tells me we have no money for this supposed hobby (he just wants me to get into one of his hobbies that I don’t enjoy) and to suck it up and stop being so negative. He can’t handle me when I get like this because he feels that I have to be emotionally strong all the time and be there for him when he’s suffering from depression and anxiety.

When you’re having sores, flu, other general body stuff that isn’t a broken bone etc— I highly recommend just taking sodium ascorbate (it’s about $15 for a three-month supply!) and some elderberry syrup or echinacea. It will save you SO much money. I hope that it helps. Sodium ascorbate has essentially saved me. I’m a student working full-time without the ability to pay my medical bills.

If you have vomiting that won't stop and you can't keep anything down, or if the vomit looks like coffee grounds, you should see a doctor. If blood comes out of places it shouldn't be coming out of, you should see a doctor.\n\nSee if your clinic has a phone number you can call to speak to a nurse. Sometimes they can help you decide what to do without costing money.\n\nAs for your canker sores, rinsing and gargle with salt water a few times a day should help them heal. Make sure you're flossing and brushing your teeth, maybe without toothpaste if it's irritating. If they don't go away, they could be an indication of something more, so keep an eye on it.  You might be able to use oragel on them if they hurt too much to eat. Try to just have soft foods. As someone said below, nutrition may be a factor.

You pay $20 a year for access to real doctors via your phone. It’s only $1 per visit too! Basically, you chat with a doctor, and if need be, you take pictures with your phone if they need to see what you’re describing. I used it last week for an infection, got diagnosed, but before I could start the required medication, the doctor ordered a lab test for me at my local clinic (LabCorps). This was to see if I was healthy enough for the medication. Once the clinic sent back my results to the doctors at 98point6, they were able to prescribe me the medication and get it sent to my local pharmacy. I used GoodRx and brought the price of the medication down from $20 to $8. All in all, I spent $63 ($20 for the yearly 98point6 membership + $1 for initial visit + $33 for the blood test + $1 for second visit to discuss results and get prescription + $8 for the actual medicine). With my insurance, I would’ve paid more than that on just the doctor’s visit. I think it does jump to $100-something for the yearly membership with them after the first year, but I will gladly pay that next year. Obviously if you have an emergency you should totally call 911, but for something simple, 98point6 will do the trick. Really glad I ran across them and will continue spreading the word.

I probably broke my nose about a year ago and never went. Have had severe illnesses like the flu and what was probably bronchitis, but I just refuse to \"waste\" time and money by going to the doctor.\n\nThe only thing I will regularly go for is mental health upkeep (I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and have battled depression my whole life) and if I am convinced I am about to die. Even then, I've told everyone to only call an ambulance if I will not survive the drive to the ER otherwise and I'll hold out until I can get in to a regular clinic so I don't have ER prices to deal with. A couple of weeks ago I went to the dentist for the first time in about 15 years because I knew I wouldn't be able to afford any work I might need.

No scans, no blood work, nothing... Basically a quick exam.\n\nAlmost every time I have been sick and tried to go to the Dr I have gotten a bill and the insurance did not cover it because they claim that they do not cover anything that would be considered \"Investigative\".

And then they put me to sleep and did an upper endoscopy, and when I woke up he just said he wants to see me again to go over what they found, and they probably ran the wrong test, I should've been more specific (I was very specific with all my symptoms) and he walked away. And then later found out I wouldn't be able to get an appointment for 3 months, so I just bailed.

Spending $1000 on insulin is nothing compared to even one DKA episode ($100k bare minimum), plus any loss of income while you're recovering, plus any loss of reputation for calling in sick (let's not pretend that doesn't happen), plus the cost of late fees since you lost income and couldn't pay on time\n\nIf there is anyone UNDER 10 YEARS OLD in your home, YOU MUST KEEP ON HAND LIQUID TYLENOL AND LIQUID IBUPROFEN AT ALL TIMES AND IN ENOUGH AMOUNT that you'll have enough for 18 hours for the biggest one, but ideally all of them separately.\n\n#\n\nPredicting the future is required to conclusively know those factors, but if you sit down and think about it, you'd just be comparing yourself to your own past behavior.\n\n## Comment ID f6fr9h1 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6fr9h1/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\n[deleted]\n\n## Comment ID f6fs4zv with +1 score by [(PatchworkStar, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6fs4zv/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nI have hypothyroidism.

I rarely go to the doctor myself because of the cost. I lived with a double hernia for 5 years before I finally got enough money for the scan and the co-pay for the operation. The only time I've been to the ER was when I got hit by a car on my bike as a kid. A couple of years ago I had food poisoning really badly and was considering going, but it cleared up by the next day and although I felt weak, I was able to rest and take the day off work. \n\nI get those cold sores also. Here are some things that have helped me.\n\n\"Canker Cover\" patches. They absorb moisture and turn into a gelatin-like bubble to protect the sore. It helps a ton because the sores then don't get irritated by teeth touching them and such. If they're inside near your lips, they can be a little cumbersome because they'll be bumping your teeth as you try to talk, but still manageable. Link:  [https://www.amazon.com/DenTek-Canker-Cover-Patch-Relief/dp/B017GQYYXO](https://www.amazon.com/DenTek-Canker-Cover-Patch-Relief/dp/B017GQYYXO) \n\nOil-pulling: Take a tablespoon of coconut oil and slowly swish it around your mouth for about 20 minutes. You don't have to gargle, just gently move it around. It will absorb impurities and help your mouth get healthier. I did it every day for a couple of weeks and then went to once every 2 weeks, although I've neglected that for a few months now. I need to get back to it. Spit the oil out after 20 minutes, preferably in the trash with some paper towels. It solidifies at room temperature and may clog pipes. \n\nHydrogen peroxide rinse: Make a 50/50 mix of hydrogen peroxide and water and swish it around for about a minute. \n\nI can understand how you feel for having gone and not getting any help from the doctor. I get frustrated about that stuff too. I use Insight Timer app to do guided meditation to help me relax. I also take Magnesium and Theanine supplements that help with mood.

Do whatever you possibly can to afford health insurance - the lower-tier plans should be free with subsidies and the silver tier plans should be free or nearly free, especially if you're in the kind of straits that most folks here find themselves in.  Don't worry too much about coverage for severe injury and accidents since those will bankrupt you even with a pretty good silver plan (and even some gold plans, depending on whether or not you can afford to soak a few thousand dollars of deductible on top of the actual costs), what you want to make sure you get are at least a couple of biannual checkups/physicals for free, and ideally some kind of limited copay for specialist consults.\n\nYou will lose a ton of money by not going to see a doctor to get preventable illnesses and conditions addressed before they can become serious problems.  Infections lead to lost work.  Lost work leads to lost pay.  Lost pay can lead to a debt spiral that can literally take decades to escape.\n\nIn the meantime, make sure you are taking a daily multivitamin.  It's possible that malnutrition is contributing to these sores, and making it difficult for them to heal.  Shoestring \"bread and water\" budgets don't often make room for crucial micronutrients, and a once-a-day multi can help limit the damage.\n\nYou may also want to look into a bottle of Listerine or other mouth cleanser.  If you've got multiple open sores, that's bacteria and clearing your mouth and a throat gargle could help.  You can also try rinsing and gargling with warm salt water.\n\n## Comment ID f6hj2k7 with +1 score by [(heyieatjunk, Reddit, 2019-11-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6hj2k7/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nI feel really sorry for you.

It’s pretty common for me to get 5-10 in my mouth. So I did a bunch of research once in desperation and found someone say to take L-Lysine, a vitamin and that it cuts the healing time. I took it and oh my god does it work. Now I take it whenever it feels like I’m about to get some and it prevents it.\n\nApparently some people have a vitamin deficiency, I guess from a lack of it in the diet that makes them more common. I get them when I’m stressed because stress can cause your immune system to weaken and allows the virus that lives in your mouth to run rampant. Anyway, take it, it’s cheap and it works. Also, get some numbing spray for the throat that’s what I do when they are killing me and I can’t sleep.\n\nEdit: P.S. do not gargle with peroxide, peroxide does kill bacteria but it also damages cells and since the wound is in your mouth the virus just gets more contact with the open wound causing them to get worse. Salt water can help, but gods does it hurt and I’ve never had them go away from it. By the way, my doctor told me the only real thing they can do is give you a antivirus like the one they give you for the flu, but  not many doctors will do that since they go away on their own.\n\n### Comment ID f6hylwt with +1 score by [(Nikeagogo79, Reddit, 2019-11-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6hylwt/) (in reply to ID f6hlddl):\nI can vouch for (admittedly anecdotal) success with L-Lysine.

Go me? Currently its at 100.9 so much better than it was before.\n\nBut ya since the dirty little secret of holiday day entails that you don't get the pay if you don't work the previous and next shifts between that day. I didn't want to call out I really didn't want to I knew probably by about 7 tonight that there was no way I was going to be able to go in.\n\nWe have to give notice an hour before our shift right? Normally that would be fine just one problem. I open. This morning in 4 hours. I looked up the unum number and called it but an automated message told me UNUM hours and disconnected the call. So clearly not the number I have called before.\n\nI haven't got a test because I can't find a pharmacy nearby that stocked any my mom ordered one offline that said it would get there on friday (when she was ordering it for herself) then it said sunday and now it says TBD)\n\nI seriously considered just calling out ahead of time on Friday Night but figured what kind of lunatic calls out sick over a day before their shift. Now that the temperature isn't as high and hallucinations have faded from the frying of my brain I realize the lunatic is the one who DOESNT call out a day before knowing full well you won't be better a day after having a 104 degree fever.\n\nBut like protocols and all that right.

They have nothing to do with reporting an absence. You just have to call your store as soon as possible, like at 4 AM when the first employees arrive.\n\nYou will still get holiday pay if you provide a doctor's note (although given Covid, the store might not even bother asking for one).\nAs of the new year, Costco is no longer uses TelaDoc..the new company is www.98point6.com, maybe they can provide you a doctors note?\n\n## Comment ID hqwj5b4 with +6 score by [(lonelyempath__, Reddit, 2022-01-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/ru2atc/costco_employee_trying_to_call_out_sick_but_cant/hqwj5b4/) (in reply to ID ru2atc):\nDo you have any of your managers or supervisors phone numbers ?\n\n## Comment ID hqwivu3 with +3 score by [(SpudInSpace, Reddit, 2022-01-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/ru2atc/costco_employee_trying_to_call_out_sick_but_cant/hqwivu3/) (in reply to ID ru2atc):\nJust call out whenever office employees arrive at your building, tell them it's for symptoms.\n\nSort out any issues about pay later, that's not as important as health.\n\n## Comment ID hqwhbmo with +3 score by [(erikathecashier, Reddit, 2022-01-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/ru2atc/costco_employee_trying_to_call_out_sick_but_cant/hqwhbmo/) (in reply to ID ru2atc):\njust leave a message at your sick line \neven if no one is in \nit says what time you called so they’d know if you did an hour of notice and as a payroll person the first thing i do is check sick callouts \nif you know the manager on duty at the time i’d text them and let them know that you left a message and you were supposed to open.\n\n### Comment ID hqxn29n with +4 score by [(Pawn01, Reddit, 2022-01-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/ru2atc/costco_employee_trying_to_call_out_sick_but_cant/hqxn29n/) (in reply to ID hqwhbmo):\nNot all stores have a sick line.

He gets shamed by the doctors for not having a doctor to see in person, even though his condition is well managed and he’s told them he can’t afford any other care. We pay out of pocket for routine labs and do everything they ask, but each appointment makes him feel worse than the last. They also act like they’re going to cut him off and stop treating him any day now, which would likely trigger permanent harm and complications due to lack of access to his maintenance meds, which are safe and he’s been using for many years. \n\nIt’s time to start shopping around for a new telemedicine service.",

Then there were layoffs and more employees at all levels left on their own. Goals have not changed. More have been added and all dead lines were kept the same. Of course when these deadlines are not met the next company meeting is negative with a lot of general blaming and saying we all just need to work harder. Communication overall has been terrible with \"we don't know yet\" being the usual answer for any concerns. Weeks without answers. Any answers are just as rushed and poorly thought out as the changes. This toxic attitude is starting with the top level but you can see it affecting teams as they feel more pressure.",

Then there were layoffs and more employees at all levels left on their own. Goals have not changed. More have been added and all dead lines were kept the same. Of course when these deadlines are not met the next company meeting is negative with a lot of general blaming and saying we all just need to work harder. Communication overall has been terrible with \"we don't know yet\" being the usual answer for any concerns. Weeks without answers. Any answers are just as rushed and poorly thought out as the changes. This toxic attitude is starting with the top level but you can see it affecting teams as they feel more pressure.",

I sincerely enjoy the company of the people who work here.\n\nA lot of companies have a list of core values that employees can rattle off, but rarely do you see them weave the core values into everything they do. 98point6 really does weave their core values into all of their work, from the interview process to our day-to-day interactions.\n\nThe company adapted well to remote work during the pandemic, and is being very thoughtful about how we adapt and cater to all employees as we move to a hybrid environment.\n\nRelentless Improvement is a core value that I've seen the company take seriously. I've seen leadership act on feedback given by employees, and continual improvements made in policies and processes, such as our interview process. Leadership and the company doesn't get things right 100% of the time, but they are passionate about making improvements when opportunities arise and when we are put in situations where the company needs to adapt.",

      "# [98point6 Technologies Announces the Acquisition of Bright.md to Accelerate the Launch of its Asynchronous Care Module on 2024-01-10](https://www.98point6.com/press_release/acquisition-brightmd-launch-asynchronous-care/)\nNew Module to Offer More Robust Integrated Virtual Care Delivery Options\n\nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON - January 16, 2024 - 98point6 Technologies, a leader in licensed on-demand virtual care software, announced the addition of a new asynchronous module to its flagship technology, allowing providers the option of delivering both live and asynchronous care capabilities. By enabling healthcare organizations to license this additional model of care delivery, 98point6 once again sets the bar with an integrated, purpose-built clinician solution that future-proofs virtual clinic operations. In related news, the company announced it has doubled-down on its growth strategy, acquiring the remaining assets of Bright.md following the sale of its technology to Evernorth, and continuing to service long-time customers Baptist Health, UAB Medicine and 14 others.\n\nThe Balancing Act: Addressing Clinician Burnout and Patient Preferences\n\nClinician burnout is rampant, with over 45% of healthcare workers feeling burnout often or very often. Meanwhile, patients are embracing digital solutions: 64% want to receive some, most, or all of their health care virtually or online in the future. By giving providers the flexibility to support multiple modes of digitally communicating with patients based on their lifestyle and care preferences, 98point6’s asynchronous virtual care module helps mitigate clinician burnout while enhancing the patient experience.\n\n“In more than two years on the platform, Bright.md exceeded our high expectations for an asynchronous digital health partner,” said Brett Oliver, MD, Chief Medical Information Officer at Baptist Health. “As our patient and clinician needs evolve, we look forward to establishing a new partnership with 98point6 Technologies to extend our patient offerings, drive operational efficiencies and further advance our mission of providing innovative, quality care to the people of Kentucky and southern Indiana.\"\n\nAsynchronous care delivery represents the next service offering for 98point6 and a commitment to growth since launching as a licensed software provider last year. The async software offering enables providers to respond when their schedule allows, backed by a solution that takes clinical decision support to the next level. The robust technology deploys machine learning models to establish an intelligent engine that supports providers with intake, diagnosis, and care documentation. Developed by a team with a proven track record of building and managing a successful nationwide virtual clinic serving millions of patients, the module paves the way for further innovations.\n\n\"Our mission at 98point6 is to build market leading technology that empower healthcare providers with the tools they need to broaden access, enhance patient engagement, and achieve cost savings through greater provider efficiency,” said Jay Burrell, CEO of 98point6 Technologies. “With the Bright.md acquisition we are dramatically accelerating our efforts to offer a robust, multi-functional virtual care software platform and it’s a tremendous opportunity to engage with these 16 innovative health systems.”\n\nFor more information on the new asynchronous offering, visit 98point6.com.\n\nAbout 98point6 Technologies\n\n98point6 Technologies builds and licenses software to power exceptional virtual care experiences for providers and patients based on years of clinical use across millions of patients. Its flagship 98point6 Technology Platform consists of turnkey, cloud-based software that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence bundled with time-tested, automated practice standards and electronic health record (EHR) integration. Their solutions include a physician-facing Clinician Console, white-labled patient-facing app and professional support services. Available as licensed software, the 98point6 Technology Platform empowers health systems to create and grow premium virtual care offerings in a rapidly evolving and competitive healthcare marketplace.

      "# [Celebrating One Year, One Team, One Place – Transcarent](https://transcarent.com/blog/celebrating-one-year-one-team-one-place)\nGlen Tullman, Chief Executive Officer, Transcarent\n\nBuilding great businesses is something that I love to do, and part of that includes knowing when and how to effectively scale. Acquisitions allow companies to grow by incorporating existing innovations, increasing market share, and many times, expanding the workforce for greater impact. In my 30+ years of building businesses, I have led dozens of mergers and acquisitions of all sizes and on both sides of the transaction. Having witnessed many successes and a few pitfalls, I believe that a shared mission and like-cultures are strong determinants of whether or not a transaction will be successful.\n\nI always say that it is easier to fix something, than to start from scratch. So long as the leadership teams who are involved in a transaction share similar values and relentlessly believe that together, they can deliver a better experience for the end user, M&A activity can be incredibly powerful, improve outcomes and business operations, and be a smart investment.\n\nWhen I first met with the team at 98point6, the leader in AI-enabled virtual care, I saw the value their technology, their clinic, and their wildly talented team, could bring to the future of Transcarent and our Members. With experience dating back to 2017 they were forward-thinking, ahead of the curve in healthcare AI, had a robust portfolio of clients and Members, and most importantly, shared a similar mission as Transcarent. Simply put, they were committed to making health and care better for people, including the physicians and others who deliver care and those of us who receive it. They were looking for directional support, commitment, and leadership that would put their technology in the hands of many more people . . . a strength of ours at Transcarent, and we were in search of forward-looking technology that could transform the virtual primary care experience. After our first discussions, the transaction was complete.\n\nOver the past year, our teams came together with the mindset of “one.” One Team. One Mission. One Place for Health and Care. This cultural mindset was ingrained from the start and made for a nearly flawless integration. Yes, we dropped a few balls along the way, but people always knew what our intent was . . . to make this the best place people ever worked and to create an experience of health and care that was new, better, and different than anything else they had come across. I am proud to say we can celebrate one year as one company that has undeniably achieved more together than we ever could have achieved alone.\n\nNothing is more important than our health and care. And no industry will have more impact on our success as a country in the future. However, despite its importance, no industry is more in need of change and improvement. 98point6 made it easy to access care 24x7x365 – easier and faster than ever before – without losing the physician connection. Since acquiring 98point6, we have continued to invest in their revolutionary AI-powered health and care experience. We even had the opportunity to highlight in front of Congress how we are delivering an experience, leading with clinical expertise, from start to finish, that is private and secure, and built to meet and exceed the needs of health consumers. Additionally, we introduced point-of-care navigation capabilities by combining the power of Transcarent's digital platform and benefit ecosystem with virtual care delivery. Expect to hear more from us regarding AI and the ways it will transform virtual primary care visits.\n\nOne of the things we are most proud of is that we are leveraging one of our greatest assets, clinicians, for the part of the visits that require their intellect and experience. Due to the personal nature of this industry, we can’t rely on technology alone. When considering the acquisition with 98point6, their affiliated Physician Group was one of the strongest selling points. The talented and caring physicians, nurses, and other clinicians who comprise the group complete the experience we’re trying to create at Transcarent . . . one that people love, offers high-quality health and care, and does so at a price that people can afford.\n\nWhen we founded Transcarent, we knew the vision of bringing all of health and care, both virtual and in-person, together on a single platform, wasn’t going to be easy or fast. But we’re here, committed as ever, with a steadfast focus on our mission of providing access to high-quality, affordable health and care. We’ve taken the steps necessary, including M&A activity and integrating other innovative solutions into our platform, to build an easy-to-use platform for our Members and clients and company for our employees.\n\nOur work is well underway, we’ve come a long way, but as Bill Gates wisely said, “If I'd had some set idea of a finish line, don't you think I would have crossed it years ago?”\n\nThanks to everyone at Transcarent for your hard work and commitment to making the last year a success.",

      "# [Powered Consumer Health Experience – Transcarent](https://transcarent.com/press-releases/transcarent-introduces-wayfinding-an-ai-powered-consumer-health-experience)\nSan Francisco, CA May 15, 2024 - Today, Transcarent, the One Place for Health and Care, announced WayFinding, a new experience that seamlessly combines generative AI with instant access to care providers to integrate benefits navigation, clinical guidance, and care delivery on one easy to use platform. WayFinding personalizes each person’s experience, orienting and guiding them through their health and care journeys, with human support never more than a tap away.\n\nWayFinding provides Members with personalized support and guidance, beginning with questions about what’s covered and what it might cost. It moves them seamlessly to the next best clinical action to take through specific guidance, and then instantly connects them to medical professionals or provides direct access into digital point solutions uniquely suited to address specific issues.\n\nAccording to a 2023 KFF poll, more than 50 percent of insured adults in America say it is difficult to understand at least some aspect of their health insurance. Forty percent of Americans with employer sponsored coverage said they didn’t understand what their health insurance covers, while 27 percent lacked understanding about specific terms their health insurance uses such as \"deductible,\" \"copay,\" and \"co-insurance.\" Increasing a person’s access to benefits information is critical as uncertainty often leads to unexpected cost, and medical debt is the number one cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. Most Americans find their healthcare to be more confusing, more complex, and more costly than ever before and getting worse, not better, with 70 percent feeling failed by the healthcare system.\n\nWayFinding addresses this complexity, uniquely combining new advancements made possible through generative AI with better information and on-demand access to clinicians, along with access to virtual point solutions and local in-person care. With WayFinding, Transcarent Members can access the care they deserve and employers can be confident their benefits are being used efficiently and effectively.\n\n“Imagine if you could go to one place, 24 hours a day, to access all your benefits, get the unbiased medical guidance you need, and then have instant access to a doctor or other healthcare professional or connect to the leading point solutions with no separate logins and membership cards needed. That’s what we’ve all been dreaming about and today Transcarent is delivering on that vision,” said Glen Tullman, Chief Executive Officer of Transcarent. “This is not just better than traditional navigation, it’s completely different. It’s like moving from a flip phone to an iPhone. The flip phone did one thing. The iPhone does everything. And we’re doing it all at half the price of traditional navigators.”\n\nThe launch of WayFinding builds on Transcarent's earlier work to responsibly incorporate AI-enabled care into the Member experience, starting with the acquisition of the 98point6 care platform, the industry-leading AI-powered care delivery solution, which facilitates immediate access to high-quality, virtual care. Using our database of close to one million documented physician chats, which informs our proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs), paired with significant investments in building an AI team over the last year, Transcarent is set apart from others in the industry. Additionally, Transcarent uses custom testing, validation, and monitoring tools to enable responsible AI development and has built a proprietary multi-pronged safety system that acts as a common safety layer across all our AI products. Our membership in and work with the Data & Trust Alliance has also informed how to use AI safely and securely.\n\nWayFinding is the answer to the challenge of getting people the right information, when and where they need it. It also reduces the burden on human resources and benefits professionals, having to spend hours answering questions from confused employees. WayFinding will drive significant improvements in utilization and engagement.\n\n“WayFinding orients you. By pulling in every detail of an employer’s plan, any offered ancillary benefits, your medical history, and pairing that information with our team of top-rated virtual care clinical specialists, we can create a personalized understanding of each Member’s unique care needs, getting them exactly where they need to be every single time,” said Snezana Mahon, PharmD, Chief Operating Officer of Transcarent. “Your health and care should know you. With WayFinding, that’s now possible. This is the future of navigation and more.”\n\nTranscarent has a proven track record of delivering care experiences that Members value, returning to the experience time and again to meet their health and care needs. Of the Transcarent Members that activate, our 70 percent utilization and retention rates demonstrate that we are delivering on our mission of making it easy to access high-quality, affordable health and care.\n\nClick here to schedule a WayFinding demo.\n\nAbout Transcarent\n\nTranscarent is the One Place for Health and Care. We cut through complexity, making it easy for people to access high-quality, affordable health and care. We create a personalized experience tailored for each Member, including an on-demand care team, and a connected ecosystem of high-quality, in-person care and virtual point solutions. Transcarent eliminates the guesswork and empowers Members to make better decisions about their health and care.\n\nTranscarent is aligned with those who pay for healthcare and takes accountability for results – offering at-risk pricing models and transparent impact reporting to ensure incentives support a measurably better experience, better health, and lower costs.

      "# [Members eliminate medications and see significant, sustained weight loss on its Type 2 diabetes reversal program through Virta Health](https://www.banneraetna.com/en/about-us/news/type-2-diabetes-reversal-program-through-virta-health.html)\nIn one year, members eliminated 66% of diabetes medications through the personalized, nutrition-first approach\n\nPhoenix, AZ (August 28, 2024): Banner|Aetna, a joint venture health plan owned by Banner Health and Aetna, a CVS Health company, announced one-year member outcomes from its diabetes reversal program powered by Virta Health, a leader in diabetes reversal and sustainable weight loss.\n\nAfter just six months, Banner|Aetna members saw transformational health outcomes. In one year, those results are even more dramatic and demonstrate the long-lasting success of Virta’s program. Sustained metabolic health improvements for Banner|Aetna members enrolled at one year include:\n\nPrescription reduction: Members eliminated 66% of diabetes medications (excluding metformin), including an 83% reduction in insulin dosages. Of those on insulin, 58% eliminated it completely.\n\nBlood sugar reduction: On average, members saw a 1.4% reduction in A1c blood sugar levels. Every one-point decrease in A1c reduces the risk of long-term diabetes complications by up to 40%.\n\nClinically significant weight loss: Members experienced 11% weight loss on average (5% is considered clinically significant). Clinically significant weight loss can lead to better sleep, reduced inflammation, improved blood pressure, reduced risk of heart disease and positive impacts on arthritis and fatty liver disease.\n\nBanner|Aetna members nationwide receive care that fits their unique lifestyle, culture, dietary preferences, and budget thanks to Virta’s expert care and personalized approach to nutrition.\n\n“Virta is flexible, and that’s why it works,” said Robert Groves, MD, executive vice president and chief medical officer at Banner|Aetna. “With one-on-one support and individualized nutrition plans, our members are achieving life-changing outcomes that last, without the need for expensive medications like GLP1s.”\n\nBanner|Aetna member David—a middle school teacher in Yuma, AZ—spent years struggling with his out-of-control Type 2 diabetes. Even while injecting two types of insulin up to six times per day, David’s blood sugar jumped to dangerous levels and he continued to gain weight. After losing several family members to the disease, he knew it was time to make a change.\n\nSince starting Virta in 2022, David has eliminated his insulin and lost 45 pounds, while lowering his blood sugar below the diabetes threshold. Most importantly, he no longer lives in fear.\n\n“After having a stroke and losing my sister to Type 2 diabetes, I was scared,” said David. “But with Virta, I’ve taken control of my health and can be excited for the future—it’s truly been life-changing.”\n\nBanner|Aetna currently offers Type 2 diabetes reversal to eligible members of fully insured and Administrative Services Only groups. The program to reverse prediabetes is also available to self-insured groups.\n\nAbout Banner|Aetna\n\nBanner|Aetna is a health insurance company focusing on bettering member outcomes at a lower cost, all while improving the overall member experience for employers and consumers in Arizona. The collaboration combines Banner Health’s high-quality, local providers and delivery systems with Aetna’s health-plan experience, care management and health information technology.

You need a cohesive strategy around this population.\n\nOn 2/15, join me, the NeuroFlow team, and a panel of experts in a virtual event.\n\nWe’ll have a much-needed conversation around how health systems, payors, and risk-bearing orgs can proactively measure and address the behavioral health of their complex patient populations.\n\nRegister Today!\n\nCigna sells MA business to HCSC for $3.7 billion\n\nAnnounced on Jan. 31, Cigna is selling its 600,000 member Medicare Advantage business to Health Care Services Corp for a disclosed $3.7B. Jared Strock had a nice breakdown of the valuation implications and the segments included on LinkedIn here.\n\nCigna added some color on its earnings call as well, noting the plan generated $12 billion in revenue in 2023. Cigna also secured a 4-year deal for its pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts to continue providing services for the plan, and Evernorth as a whole will have opportunities to sell other services like clinical care coordination into the newly secured HCSC asset. Overall, the deal is expected to close in early 2025.\n\nInterestingly (maybe perplexing is a better word), Cigna still described the MA market as attractive despite the sale. What’s up with that?\n\nThe answer lies in Evernorth – its services segment – and bolstering the Evernorth footprint. Cigna was happy with the structure of the deal since it locked in Express Scripts for a number of years, while offloading an asset that wasn’t worth the trouble. From here, Cigna can prioritize Evernorth bolt-on acquisitions and find growth in working on the services side of MA, Medicaid – as a payor agnostic option.\n\nwe’ve been quite deliberate now for several years, working to expand the service portfolio and the value proposition within Evernorth for health plan partners as it relates to their government services, be it Medicare, be it duals, be it Medicaid, et cetera. And we’re demonstrating a very attractive proven track record of growing our government reach but through the services franchise. And we will continue to fuel that on a go-forward basis and see that as an attractive trajectory for us.\n\nWe see the Evernorth service portfolio as an attractive capital-light high visibility way to grow this portfolio.\n\nFinally, with all of the hubbub happening around Medicare Advantage and utilization right now, it’s interesting to see a company as massive as Cigna go at the MA market without a vertically aligned strategy, but the puzzle pieces must not have been fitting well together. It wouldn’t surprise me to see Cigna make a big acquisition in a better-run MA plan down the line. While peak growth is up and profitability is declining in the segment, there’s still money to be made in all aspects of the entitlement program.\n\nA Fall from Grace for Cano Health and Steward Health Care\n\nI’ve written about Cano’s troubles in the past (and covered Steward’s from afar), but I did want to highlight some important updates and great reporting on each of these.\n\nAs Steward Health Care struggles to stay afloat and deals with the repercussions of its poor operations in Massachusetts and elsewhere, its CEO Ralph De la Torre has plenty to answer for given the state of operations at his hospitals and their financial turmoil post-pandemic. Things have gotten even worse in 2024 as the Boston Globe found out – e.g., physicians buying their own surgical equipment, nurseries closed at birthing centers, and other egregious conditions these clinicians are dealing with.\n\nThere has never been a clearer microcosm for things gone wrong in healthcare than what we’re seeing unfold here.\n\nA health system in financial and operational disarray.\n\nPotential for patient harm rampant.\n\nPrivate capital and real estate involvement in debt-fueled acquisitions, unusual, fraud-like loan structures, and sale-leasebacks causing hospitals to buckle in underserved communities.\n\nAnd then the CEO spotted in the Galapagos – something I’ll probably never see beyond the Planet Earth documentary – on his $40M yacht.\n\nTHIS is how you sow mistrust in public institutions. I mean, it’s the easiest dunk session in history from the media’s perspective. The optics from the outside looking in are worse than bad with de la Torre and Medical Properties Trust shenanigans. This from the WSJ was back in 2022, and then we saw this follow-up from the WSJ paints the full picture of financial back alley deals happening for years. I mean, you’re just asking for it at this point. I hope you all can agree with me that we need to get this crap out of healthcare. And stories like these only equip members the media, public, and ultimately policymakers to crack down on hospitals.\n\nThis Boston Globe essay (paywall) was so well done and worth the read.\n\nMassachusetts Wakes Up to a Hospital Nightmare\n\nThis timeline of Steward Health Care was phenomenal as well: How Steward Health Care went from hospital savior to the precipice of failure\n\nSteward Health Care employees, patients grapple with turmoil (paywall – Boston Globe)\n\nIn similar fashion, Cano Health has left its physician equity holders out to dry. (If any of you are following this newsletter, feel free to reach out to me.) Earlier on Monday, Cano Health officially filed for bankruptcy after hemorrhaging cash for sometime from failing to appropriately manage risk or right-size the sinking ship. Cano’s stock will be delisted, wiping out common shareholders, and likely doing the same to its physician ‘partners,’ many of whose practice buyouts (and retirements) were funded via a combination of cash and equity.\n\nNobody should feel bad (other than for the patients and care teams, obviously) for this piece of junk getting taken out. At least the bankruptcy restructuring is assuring that staff gets paid and patients still get care, but the result here was a foregone conclusion after the history of mismanagement. There’s a reason why CVS backed out, and Humana – despite having a right of first refusal – STILL hasn’t touched it!! Cano Health put a sour taste on value-based care initiatives, and I’m glad I can move on from these guys in order to cover players actually trying to fix healthcare. By the way, CareMax is probably next.\n\nCano Health’s downfall offers a warning for Medicare Advantage (Stat paywall)\n\nAlright, that’s enough of that. You guys please send me some awesome folks, organizations, and health systems doing cool things the right way for their communities now.\n\nStrategy Updates:\n\nAnything affecting decision making in healthcare – notable moves and strategies to keep on your radar.\n\nStrong Tenet Results Bolster Utilization Outlook: As Tenet makes divestitures in the acute care space, its USPI portfolio is outperforming. In a pre-announced earnings release, Tenet noted that strong surgical growth in USPI resulted in higher than expected profitability – above the high end of its adjusted EBITDA guidance for ‘23. Will cover this in more detail once the full release is out. (Link)\n\n2025 MA Rates Disappoint: Although CMS’ advanced MA rate notice increases the base rate by 3.7% (if that’s characterized incorrectly don’t sue me), changes to overall MA risk score trends will result in a net 0.2% decline to MA rates in 2025. More info here → (Link)\n\nFirst Healthcare IPO disappoints: BrightSpring Health Services debuted on the public markets to an unfortunately muted response, which disappointed me. We need more upbeat energy around healthcare IPOs. I’m hoping the up and coming firms inject some positivity – and working business models – into the public markets.\n\nScathing LifeStance Short Report: Famous short-selling shop Hindenburg Research put out an infamous short report on hybrid behavioral health player LifeStance Health this week, noting a number of perceived issues at the firm, including issues around retention rate, compensation numbers, CFO turnover, ease of prescription access for controlled substances, and more. (Link)\n\nOverall, we think LifeStance is a classic example of what happens when private equity meets a ‘hot’ healthcare sector: Massive debt fueling a grinding, metric-focused corporate culture resulting in worse quality of care for patients, a worse environment for clinicians and long-term losses for the average investor.\n\nWhich reminds me of the short report Citron Research put together on agilon. Guess they were vindicated after all, huh?\n\nPartnership, Products, and Pilot Announcements:\n\nAllina Health is offloading 2,000 admin employees to Optum in an outsourcing deal we’ve seen a few times over the past couple of years. Interestingly, though SSM Health ended its contract with Optum after outsourcing 2,100 employees to them. I guess that’s one way to conduct layoffs at a nonprofit health system huh?\n\nAcadia Healthcare enters into a joint venture partnership with Ascension Seton to expand behavioral health services in Austin, Texas.

Read Optum’s petition to the Oregon State Health Authority here. Un-redact the purchase price, you cowards!!\n\nAtlantic Health System and Saint Peter’s Healthcare System plan to merge:\n\n“Under the terms of the LOI, Atlantic Health System would make significant investments in Saint Peter’s and the service area, helping Saint Peter’s to continue to evolve as a high-quality, resourceful, and comprehensive healthcare system serving communities throughout central New Jersey.

In total, 3,442 physicians have used Nabla to help with documentation, and 968 of those have used it during 100+ encounters.\n\nTL;DR – ambient documentation is great, letting physicians have more meaningful patient interactions and spending less time on admin work. Patients were also generally fine with MDs using Nabla’s tool\n\nIt’s also crazy accurate!! a review of 35 AI-generated transcripts resulted in an average score of 48 of 50 in 10 key domains\n\nThe study also listed next steps for AI ambient players: “Ongoing enhancements of the technology are needed and are focused on direct EHR integration, improved capabilities for incorporating medical interpretation, and enhanced workflow personalization options for individual users…ongoing attention must be paid to ensure that the technology supports clinicians while also optimizing ambient AI scribe output for accuracy, relevance, and alignment in the physician–patient relationship.”\n\nInteresting applications of Apple’s new mixed reality headset Vision Pro are surfacing – like in diagnostic imaging; pretty dang cool. I’m incredibly excited to see potential new use cases for mixed reality from the surprisingly well-polished product. I mean, radiologists are pretty used to staring at screens in dark rooms so maybe this means they can actually get some sunlight!\n\nThe first Neuralink implant called Telepathy was implanted into a willing recipient.

We shot an 82 at the home course and the game felt…alright. I’ve played a few times since baby Madden, but I’m definitely rusty, and rust is noticeable in the feel of the hands on shorter wedge shots and putting. The swing is surprisingly coherent though, which is good considering I have a big golf trip coming up in early April at Pine Dunes in east Texas, if any of you have ever played out there. One of my favorites.\n\nAnother fun little anecdote. My wife and I were at the mall ordering coffee, and you know how they ask for your name? Well I told the barista my name, but either I didn’t speak clearly or she was having some fun with me. When I got my coffee the name on it was “Spleck.” Spleck?! So…now I have a new nickname!\n\nSPONSORED BY AHA MEDIA GROUP\n\nYou guys heard from Aha Media Group during our virtual event on 1/31.

      "# [Mt. Joy (restaurant) by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2024-03-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Joy_(restaurant))\nRestaurant chain based in Seattle, Washington, U.S.\n\nMt. Joy is a restaurant chain specializing in chicken sandwiches, based in Seattle, Washington. The business launched a food truck on Capitol Hill in September 2023, followed by a brick-and-mortar restaurant on December 1. Ethan Stowell is among the co-owners of Mt. Joy, which specializes in fried chicken sandwiches.\n\nDescription\n\n[edit]\n\nMt. Joy has been described as a fast-casual restaurant chain specializing in chicken sandwiches that \"focuses on pasture-raised chickens sourced from local farms who have an environmentally-friendly focus\", according to The Seattle Times.[1] The magazine Seattle Metropolitan has said the sandwiches \"double as a means to overhaul agricultural processes that contribute to climate change\".[2] Mt. Joy bills itself as the \"first ever regenerative-focused\" restaurant in the Pacific Northwest.[3]\n\nThe business operates a brick-and-mortar restaurant on Seattle's Capitol Hill, as well as a food truck. The restaurant's interior has shades of green and white.[4] Spicy or mild versions of fried chicken sandwiches have breasts or thighs, as well as lettuce, tomato, and a house sauce on a brioche bun.[2] Mt. Joy also serves a portobello sandwich.[5] The menu also includes chicken tenders,[6] milkshakes, as well as French fries with five dipping sauces made in-house.[2] Mt. Joy sources ingredients locally and also serves beer. The custom buns are made by Franz Bakery.[2]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nConception and development\n\n[edit]\n\nRobbie Cape conceived of the business after watching Kiss the Ground, a 2020 documentary film about regenerative agriculture; he recruited regenerative farmer Grant Jones to co-found the restaurant, and also brought on chef and restaurateur Ethan Stowell to be a partner.[1][2][7]\n\nIn October 2022, The Seattle Times reported that owners hoped to open the first restaurant in Seattle by the Fall 2023, with additional locations planned throughout the Pacific Northwest. Mt. Joy's three-day pop-up and fried chicken sandwich test run was held at the Capitol Hill location of Stowell's Italian restaurant Tavolàta in October 2022.[1][2] The chickens were supplied by Hungry Hollow, Jones's family farm in Shelton, Washington.[8] During the pop-up, Mt. Joy also served the portobello sandwich, fries, and three varieties of milkshakes (chocolate, huckleberry, and vanilla).[8] Mt. Joy had another three-day pop-up at Stowell's restaurant Rione XIII in May 2023.[9][10][11]\n\nFirst food truck and brick-and-mortar restaurant\n\n[edit]\n\nIn September 2023, Mt. Joy launched a food truck on East Olive Way, in the parking lot of a former Starbucks shop. According to GeekWire, Mt. Joy had fifteen employees at the time.[5][12] Mt. Joy also announced plans to open a brick-and-mortar restaurant on Capitol Hill,[13] on the ground level of the Sunset Electric apartment building near the intersection of 11th and Pine Street.[3][14]\n\nThe restaurant opened on December 1, 2023, with a reported $1.5 million in funding from multiple investors.[15][16] Harry Cheadle of Eater Seattle noted how Mt. Joy opened in close proximity to multiple fried chicken eateries,[17] and even launched the same week as a Dave's Hot Chicken restaurant.[18] In addition to Hungry Hollow, four other farms in Western Washington have supplied chickens to Mt. Joy, as of late 2023.[18]\n\nAccording to Eater Seattle, the owners hope to expand to thousands of locations.[8]\n\nLeadership\n\n[edit]\n\nCape is the chief executive officer. Pat Snavely is another founding partner as well as chief marketing officer.[8] Justin Kaufman is a co-founder as well as Mt. Joy's chief technology officer.[7]\n\nDionne Himmelfarb, who has been a chef for Stowell, is the chief culinary officer,[2] and Jones is the chief agricultural officer.[7]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nGeorge Burquest of Seattle University's student publication The Spectator gave the white meat chicken sandwich a rating of 7 out of 10 and wrote, \"All in all, Mt. Joy was a very pleasant experience, but nothing to write home about. The sandwich looked like a dictionary definition ... and the flavors were by book as well.\"[4]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nFood portal\n\nChicken sandwich wars\n\nFried chicken restaurant\n\nList of chicken restaurants\n\nList of food trucks\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",

      "# [Expert Tips For High Availability Through Workload Orchestration by Expert Panel® on 2024-12-02](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/12/02/expert-tips-for-high-availability-through-workload-orchestration/)\nMaintaining a seamless, uninterrupted user experience is central to effective workload orchestration. With today’s tech environments spanning on-premises and cloud networks, diverse teams, and connected devices, flexible and well-considered strategies are essential.\n\nIt’s a complex challenge, and expert advice can be invaluable. Below, members of Forbes Technology Council share their experience and advice for developing an effective workload orchestration system. Tap into their expertise to help your team deliver reliable, optimized services and an excellent user experience.\n\n1. Integrate Multicloud Platforms With Automated Failover\n\nBy integrating multicloud platforms with automated failover mechanisms, workloads can dynamically shift from one cloud provider to another in the event of an outage, ensuring minimal downtime. This also allows for the application of load balancing techniques that dynamically distribute traffic across multiple regions, ensuring optimal performance while preventing overload on any single node. - Bhaskar Gangipamula, Quadrant Technologies\n\n2. Combine Workload Distribution With Monitoring And Recovery\n\nThe strategy should include two parts. First, have workloads distributed across multiple availability zones to ensure high availability. Second, have monitoring and recovery systems in place that include prompt alerts, self-healing capabilities and regular backups. - Ravi Laudya, SAP Concur\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify?\n\n3. Leverage Container Orchestration\n\nA strategy for high availability and fault tolerance is to use container orchestration tools like Kubernetes. These tools split your app into smaller containers distributed across multiple servers. If one server fails, Kubernetes automatically shifts the workload to the other, healthy containers, ensuring minimal downtime and uninterrupted service—like a backup system that keeps everything running smoothly. - KJ Dhaliwal, Lotus Health AI\n\n4. Set Up Autonomous AI Agents\n\nAutonomous AI agents provide real value by analyzing patterns in system logs, performance metrics and error rates. They can proactively detect issues before they result in downtime. By identifying anomalies and predicting potential failures, these agents can trigger preventive actions, such as scaling resources, rerouting traffic or spinning up services, to ensure high availability. - Manjula Iyer, 98point6 Technologies\n\n5. Consider This Three-Step Approach\n\nHaving built a high-availability and fault-tolerant VoIP soft switch, we took three major steps. First, we deployed across multiple cloud providers to eliminate outages caused by underlying data center failures. Second, end-user devices were registered to different nodes, preventing the entire site from experiencing issues. Lastly, we utilized active-active environments that are always in sync, allowing us to reprioritize traffic in real time. - Hamed Mazrouei, Milagro\n\n6. Validate Your Availability And Fault Tolerance In Noncrisis Situations\n\nThere is no substitute for validating your high availability and fault tolerance strategy on a regular basis in noncrisis situations. Make needed adjustments during these validation periods to improve the durability of your solution. A best practice would be to spend the appropriate amount of time up front designing the strategy and then validating it with current operations to make updates as required. - Russ Kennedy, Nasuni\n\n7. Use A Hybrid Setup\n\nAn effective strategy is using a multicloud or hybrid setup. This spreads workloads across different cloud providers, reducing the risk of downtime. Combine this with auto-scaling and load balancing, which adjust resources based on demand, and use automation to detect and fix issues early, keeping systems running smoothly without manual intervention. - Ehsan Ahmadi, Vox Solutions\n\n8. Leverage A Microservices-Based Architecture\n\nA microservices-based architecture helps prevent single points of failure by distributing functionality. Design services to be idempotent and stateless, decoupling state to enhance resilience and scalability. Utilize self-healing orchestration tools like Kubernetes, and adopt active-active configurations for data and state management to ensure continuous availability and robust fault tolerance. - Koushik Sundar, Citibank\n\n9. Build A Decoupled System\n\nYou can achieve high availability and fault tolerance in many ways, but at what cost? Tools like Kubernetes and load balancers can help. But to effectively achieve high availability and fault tolerance, you should build a decoupled system so that different components are isolated and have only the necessary dependencies between them. This will allow you to orchestrate the workload only for those components that require it. - Oleg Lola, MobiDev\n\n10. Focus On Optimization\n\nOne strategy for ensuring high availability and fault tolerance through effective workload orchestration is to focus on optimization. Not every node needs the same amount of processing power; it’s important to have load balance functionality and do stress testing to stay ahead of the game. - Syed Ahmed, Act-On Software\n\n11. Follow The Principle That ‘Everything Fails, All The Time’\n\nThis may be a bit more philosophical, but when designing any critical system, I follow this principle: “Everything fails, all the time.” This mindset drives designs that eliminate single points of failure, favor distributed systems with “shared nothing” architecture, and incorporate queuing mechanisms. Though it’s often overlooked, non-software resilience—like multiregion deployments and robust network configurations—is also important, even in the cloud. - Elliott Cordo, Data Futures\n\n12. Use Containerization And Automated Scaling\n\nOne effective way to keep things running smoothly is to use containerization and automated scaling. This allows you to isolate applications, which makes them consistent across environments. Orchestrators help by automatically managing these containers and distributing workloads evenly while monitoring for failures. When an issue is detected, the orchestrator can adjust with little to no downtime. - Thomas Griffin, OptinMonster\n\n13. Implement Messaging Queues And Asynchronous Processing Patterns\n\nBased on our experience building healthcare apps, implementing message queues and asynchronous processing patterns is essential. By decoupling services and using tools like RabbitMQ, we create buffer zones that prevent system overload. If one component slows down, messages stay in the queue until processing capacity recovers. - Marc Fischer, Dogtown Media LLC\n\n14. Utilize Active-Passive Failover Architectures\n\nUtilize active-passive failover architectures by designing your system with an active instance and a passive standby. The passive instance takes over in the event of a failure, ensuring minimal downtime. - Manasi Sharma, Microsoft\n\n15. Ensure Multiple Redundancies\n\nUse redundant hardware, software and network components. Implement load balancing to evenly distribute workloads and clustering to allow multiple servers to operate as a single system, improving performance. Utilize database replication to ensure data accessibility across locations, even during failures. Together, these strategies ensure high availability and fault tolerance, creating a resilient infrastructure. - Brian Sathianathan, Iterate.ai\n\n16. Use Service Mesh Architecture With Open-Source Tools\n\nOne overlooked strategy I would like to highlight is using service mesh architecture with open-source tools like Istio or Linkerd. By abstracting network traffic management between services, you gain fine-grained control over load balancing, retries and automatic failovers. This approach will ensure high availability and fault tolerance without adding complexity to the application code. - Santhosh Vijayabaskar\n\n17. Implement ‘Degraded Mode’ Capabilities\n\nImplement “degraded mode” capabilities across all critical services. Instead of binary up-down states, design systems to gracefully reduce functionality when under stress. For example, disable real-time updates while keeping core transactions running, or serve cached data instead of live queries. This ensures business continuity even during partial failures. - Chandra Kuchi, Robinhood\n\n18. Take A Proactive Approach",
      "# [2024 Medical Plans](https://epc.org/benefits/2024medical/)\nEPC Benefit Resources, Inc., offers five medical benefit plans that vary in richness from platinum to bronze levels, and include traditional copay and high-deductible plan options. This allows EPC churches and ministries to select plans that meet their health care commitment to their pastors and staff while working within their budget constraints. It is important to note that the EPC has established its own plans with customized coverages, so the program rates charged will never support procedures that are not ethically consistent with our values as Christians. Our traditional plans include Platinum, Gold, and Silver POS (Point of Service) Plans, and we offer Gold- and Bronze-level High-Deductible Health Plans (HDHP) that allow for use of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs).\n\nAll five plans utilize the broadest unrestricted national networks available through our plan administrators. These networks cover approximately 95% of all hospitals, doctors, specialists, and medical practitioners nationally and almost 100% of pharmacies. It is always to your benefit to select in-network service providers, whether it is a family doctor, specialist, hospital, lab, or an administration clinic. You can confirm that your provider is in-network simply by calling them, asking when you present your ID card, or by going to the medical or prescription program provider links provided below to see if the doctor, hospital, clinic, pharmacy, etc. is listed. If you select an out-of-network provider your benefit level will be reduced and you may see balance billing from a provider.\n\nThere is no requirement in any of our Plans to select a Primary Care Physician (PCP) to coordinate your care. Prescription drug coverage is automatically included when you enroll in a Medical Plan. All plans include wellness programs, 24/7 virtual doctor visits through telemedicine, and special assistance programs to support those with chronic or serious medical conditions, or who encounter medical emergencies. Please refer to the appropriate Summary of Benefits document for your Plan or the Medical/Prescription Drug Plan Document for more information on coverage levels.\n\nUnder the prescription benefit it is likewise important that you use an in-network pharmacy whenever you are filling a doctor’s prescription order. For users of longer-term supplies (90 day) of maintenance medicines you will receive the lowest co-pays by when utilizing mail order home delivery services or your local pharmacy. For high-cost, specialty medication users, participants are directed to specialty pharmacies where pharmacists and clinicians will provide advice on usage and administration procedures for the medication. For our members utilizing such costly medications, the EPC offers a special benefit that covers some—and in many cases, all—of the co-pay costs. For more information on the EPC’s Prescription Drug Plan, see Appendix 7 of the Medical/Prescription Drug Plan Document or your individual Plan’s summary of benefits.\n\nFor your reference, the handy side-by-side comparison chart below shows the deductibles, co-pays, out-of-pocket limits, and coverages for each of the Medical and Prescription Drug plans.\n\nClick here for answers to frequently asked questions about BRI’s 2024 Medical Plans.\n\nUse these quicklinks to navigate to a specific section of this page:\n\nMedical Plan Documents\n\nPrograms for Medical Plan Participants\n\nProvider Network Resources\n\nMedical Plan Resources\n\nLogging Into Your Meritain Health Account\n\nVirtual Primary Care\n\nHigh-Deductible Health Plans (HDHP) and Health Savings Accounts (HSA)\n\nHealth Savings Accounts Resources\n\nMaking Changes to Your Coverage\n\nMachine Readable Files (MRFs)\n\nEnter the following information, then select “Submit.”\n\n• Member ID (located on your member ID Card).\n\n• First name (employee, spouse, or dependent).\n\n• ZIP code.\n\n• Date of birth (mm/dd/yyyy).\n\n• Group ID #18191.\n\n• Last name (employee, spouse, or dependent).\n\n• Email (personal address).\n\nYou will be prompted to create a username and password.
