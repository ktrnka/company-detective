      "# [98point6 Technologies on 2024-03-08](https://www.98point6.com/platform/)\nAsynchronous care, or “async,” is a type of virtual care with no scheduling requirements, giving the patient the flexibility and convenience to seek care for non-urgent concerns whenever and wherever they’d like. Whereas a response from a provider may occur quickly, there is no real-time interaction between the patient and the medical staff. This type of dedicated care also helps with capturing revenue by incorporating patient messages from a provider’s inbox back into the patient chart to enhance the continuity of care. 98point6 can support your clinicians in asynchronously diagnosing and treating more than 140 common conditions for patients across all ages—from pediatrics to geriatrics.\n\nOur AI-powered solution leverages evidence-based clinical content, machine learning, and automation to recommend the optimal care option, while also giving patients the ability to choose the format they prefer. Customizable to the specific workflow of the healthcare organization, the clinician can direct the patient to real-time care or prompt them to seek in-person care if their medical concern cannot be treated asynchronously.\n\nReal-time virtual care can consist of text-based messaging, audio, or video interactions, or any combination of the three. Additionally, real-time care can be facilitated as an on-demand or scheduled visit. On-demand visits allow patients to immediately start a visit, any time, from anywhere. Patients can report symptoms and concerns and our product gathers relevant history, before connecting the patient to a clinician. Wait times in the queue are dependent on clinician availability. Scheduled visits allow patients to choose a date and time in the future that is most convenient for them.\n\nOur patient intake automates much of the administrative tasks associated with taking a history. Our product is trained, based on millions of patient encounters, to respond to patient-reported symptoms with question sets, written by physicians, that elicit relevant clinical details for provider review. It works like this: the patient enters their chief complaint as free text. They can write as much or as little as they want to communicate the reason for their visit and their symptoms. The 98point6 platform intakes all of that information and then generates the appropriate follow-up questions.\n\nOur patient intake process significantly reduces the administrative burden on clinicians – and automatically captures an accurate transcript of patient-reported symptoms.\n\nWe have been applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to medical encounters since 2015. As a result, we have a vast data set that is one-of-a-kind in the field of natural language processing for medical applications. We utilize Al and machine learning to improve both efficiency and medical quality by automating time-consuming tasks, allowing clinicians to focus their judgment on key decision points in the clinical encounter. Our system provides information and actions for the clinician to consider; however, the clinician is in complete control of the visit diagnosis, and care planning.\n\nData integration is cornerstone to the 98point6 platform. EMR data can be automatically pulled into the clinician console, and once the visit is complete, data is automatically sent to the EMR to be recorded in the patient’s medical record. Our standards-based integration supports Epic and Cerner, as well as other EMRs. The platform also supports data integrations for analytics, reporting, security and compliance and other administrative needs.",

As part of the deal, hundreds of 98point6 enterprise customers including Boeing, Kindercare and Banner|Aetna employing millions of eligible members will have access to an even wider selection of primary and behavioral health services through Transcarent. The newly emerged 98point6 Technologies plans to remain solely focused on licensing its software to third-party health care providers such as MultiCare Health System, the first to license the 98point6 Technology Platform within its hybrid ambulatory care platform, Indigo Health.\n\n“Our evolution to 98point6 Technologies answers the need for purpose-built technology created by physicians, for physicians, and is the culmination of work our front-line team of clinicians spent years perfecting,” said Jay Burrell, President and Chief Executive Officer of 98point6 Technologies. “This comes at a time when every provider in the health services industry is on an urgent mission to remain competitive in what has become an increasingly crowded and undifferentiated marketplace.”\n\nIn today’s market, demand for telehealth services has stabilized at 38 times higher than pre-pandemic levels and healthcare providers are scrambling to catch up, citing telehealth implementation as a top challenge. According to new research only 13% of hospitals and health systems consider themselves ahead of the pace of change that patients expect and new market rivals are setting, and only 11% of health systems report being in the implementation phase of their personalized care and digital transformation journeys.\n\nHealth systems recognize they must move quickly to solidify their brand presence and physical footprint, starting with the expansion of their ambulatory care business and introduction of new technology and consumer-centered services. Gartner’s Hype Cycle for Healthcare Providers, 2022 corroborated the shift, stating “we see greater provider interest and focus on virtual care and total experience to meet clinical and business demands.”\n\nTechnology Built to Give Health Care Providers a Competitive Edge\n\nThe 98point6 Technology Platform provides a turn-key, cloud-based solution for scaling up a virtual care operation complete with software, professional services and support from a team who built and operated a successful, nationwide virtual clinic for the past several years. The platform provides a quick and cost effective way to create new revenue opportunities, better support the workforce, improve care and boost the bottom line. Implementation includes a client-branded app and assistance in configuring the platform.\n\n“Our strategic partnership with 98point6 will help us scale our digital capabilities to meet community demand and bring a new level of meaningful engagement to our customers,” said Ryan Fix, President of Retail Health at MultiCare.\n\nAt the heart of the 98point6 Technology Platform is a web-based Clinician Console, which encapsulates a refined set of best practices designed to help providers deliver high quality virtual care based on years of clinical experience. Built-in logic in the form of artificial intelligence (AI) and automated practice standards guide providers to quickly make the right medical decisions or recommend in-person care when needed. This level of automation limits care variability, optimizes patient time by streamlining the intake process and reduces cognitive load on the provider to support top-of-licensure practice.\n\nThe 98point6 Technology Platform includes:\n\nA standalone digital clinic hosted in the cloud, including AI-powered patient engagement, workflow and EHR integration, care follow-up and documentation.\n\nWeb-based Clinician Console for providers to conduct visits.\n\nAn SDK to create a fully-branded patient experience.\n\nTraining and development for clinicians and staff.\n\nEngagement marketing support to activate new users and drive utilization.\n\nWorkforce management guidance to help define hybrid staffing and scheduling plans.\n\nFor more information on 98point6 Technologies, visit 98point6.com.\n\nAbout 98point6 Technologies\n\n98point6 Technologies builds and licenses software to power exceptional virtual care experiences for providers and patients based on years of clinical use across millions of patients.

The dr said to get him tested for covid. What?! He had an ear at infection not covid. He has really bad allergies that causes fluid in his ears. Well it caused an ear infection in his left ear. The dr said it is probably a cold causing the redness in the ear and will go away in a few days. I told her no it’s an ear infection and he needs antibiotics . She wouldn’t help.

The first two visits were really good.  I would have highly recommended. Then the last two visits happened. I not only will no longer use this but I’m going share with everyone I know not to use! Both visits all the Doctors cared about was COVID and pushing the COVID vaccination. We understand being concerned with COVID but not everything is COVID! And when they are told you already tested negative and they continue only talking about COVID. That’s unacceptable! Also no vaccination is supposed to be given to anyone who is sick. Adults, children, infants, the elderly.  It doesn’t matter and a medical doctor SHOULD KNOW THIS! They did nothing to help at either visit. And we mean nothing! They didn’t listen to any of the list of things that you answer before logging in. Anything said while chatting. Neither Doctor ever got on the video chat like they are supposed to do. Oh and the wait times were way longer then estimated. So if you want no help, to waste your money, and to waste an hour or more off your day then this is perfect! Seems like a great idea to get seen without going to a hospital, urgent care ,etc. or your primary can’t get you in and you don’t have to risk catching something else. BUT they do nothing to actually treat you. After both visits we had the family members taken to our local urgent care and both times they needed medical treatment and or medication.  Medication that should have and could have been given through the doctors on this app. Also 98.6 sends you emails asking how you’re visit went. Both times the surveys were answered with the truth and how bad the service was. Do you think we heard anything back?

      "# Do not recommend!!!!, 1 stars [(bobbyemc, Apple App Store, 2021-05-03)](https://apple/7295542298)\nOur insurance signed my family up for this during the pandemic. The first two visits were really good.  I would have highly recommended. Then the last two visits happened. I not only will no longer use this but I’m going share with everyone I know not to use! Both visits all the Doctors cared about was COVID and pushing the COVID vaccination. We understand being concerned with COVID but not everything is COVID! And when they are told you already tested negative and they continue only talking about COVID. That’s unacceptable! Also no vaccination is supposed to be given to anyone who is sick. Adults, children, infants, the elderly.  It doesn’t matter and a medical doctor SHOULD KNOW THIS! They did nothing to help at either visit. And we mean nothing! They didn’t listen to any of the list of things that you answer before logging in. Anything said while chatting. Neither Doctor ever got on the video chat like they are supposed to do. Oh and the wait times were way longer then estimated. So if you want no help, to waste your money, and to waste an hour or more off your day then this is perfect! Seems like a great idea to get seen without going to a hospital, urgent care ,etc. or your primary can’t get you in and you don’t have to risk catching something else. BUT they do nothing to actually treat you. After both visits we had the family members taken to our local urgent care and both times they needed medical treatment and or medication.  Medication that should have and could have been given through the doctors on this app. Also 98.6 sends you emails asking how you’re visit went. Both times the surveys were answered with the truth and how bad the service was. Do you think we heard anything back? NOPE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! \n\nSo This review is being written and we hope that it will be a cautionary tale about this app and what to expect.",

      "# Post ID bg7ip2: Internet medicine is awesome, 98point6 was so so helpful for me with +56 score by [(FrugalChef13, Reddit, 2019-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/)\n**TL;DR- $20 got me an awesome appointment with a nice doctor and a prescription for a medication I could afford that solved my issue.**\n\n*Disclaimer: This particular thing worked well for me so I'm going to tell you about it. Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I'm not compensated or connected to the website I'm discussing.*\n\nSo like a lot of people on here I'm usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it's underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I've got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I'd run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn't been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn't, it's weird.\n\nSo I was fucked.  Can't sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can't afford the $100+ for a doctor's appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there's a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\n\nSo I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It's $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I'm drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I'm still in bad shape tomorrow morning it's worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\n\nGuys, it was amazing.  It's not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I'd already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn't help.  She was so kind, and didn't make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor's appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it's faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can't prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I'd taken in the past wasn't an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What's the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\n\nUsually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it's what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you'll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can't estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\n\nThis amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I'll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn't shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that's a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\n\nI would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It's not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it's a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\n\nIf anyone else has recommendations or critiques or thoughts on internet medicine stuff I'd love to hear it.\n\n## Comment ID elj1h0o with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/elj1h0o/) (in reply to ID bg7ip2):\nThat sounds like a great resource!

Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.\n\nA prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\n\nControlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\n\nSo the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.  Neither medication can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor, but Vicodin is super extra hard to get prescribed.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nEDIT: I tried to clarify the original post to make it more obvious that although she couldn't prescribe the thing I'd taken in the past, she did prescribe a thing that helped a lot.  It actually helped even more than the thing I'd taken in the past and without making me drowsy, which is AWESOME!\n\n#### Comment ID elkh6df with +3 score by [(Mr_Fuzzo, Reddit, 2019-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/elkh6df/) (in reply to ID eljx9uw):\nControlled substances, for the un-initiated are medications like opiates, barbiturates, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, etc.\n\nSo, meds like Xanax, OxyContin, Ritalin, etc.\n\n#### Comment ID eljy54o with +2 score by [(AnotherDay_RS, Reddit, 2019-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/eljy54o/) (in reply to ID eljx9uw):\nThat's great!!

They will try to fill it for me once if they can get in touch with the person who prescribed in to me, but idk if that's actually going to happen. I might try to transfer my prescription elsewhere but the only other pharmacy anywhere near me is a CVS and from what I've seen, they also don't fill many telehealth prescriptions for controlled substances. \n\nAnd yeah, I understand caution with controlled substances, but it's really weird to me that if any other certified provider had prescribed this, it would have been fine, but because it was a certified provider online it's not ok???

Words can’t describe how much I hate that stupid company. I’d recommend calling your primary care provider and explaining the situation. Most of the time they can write it as long as you can show a diagnosis and proof you’ve taken it before. \n\nThat’ll also protect you from losing your prescription when the pandemic exemption eventually expires— it’s a general rule for controlled substances that you need at least one in-person meeting with the doctor before they can fill it. I think some places don’t require this, but AFAIK it was a requirement pre-2020. I know they did also always require the person who prescribed it to be in-state back then as well. \n\nAt least they stopped requiring you to physically deliver HANDWRITTEN prescriptions. That was the stupidest thing. You’d normally get 3 at a time, and if you lost one for the month? Sucks to suck. Can’t think of a less adhd-friendly system. I think that changed 2018-ish?

I love the simplicity and often lower cost of telehealth, but I honestly wonder if they ever decline to give out a prescription. If you want Adderall, you just pay the online provider and get a script. There are even telehealth services for testosterone replacement therapy prescribing 200mg of testosterone to 19 year old kids who basically want legal anabolic steroids. I've seen guys with testosterone levels of 800pg/dL getting TRT scripts for quadruple the normal dosage. While some providers may be acting responsibly, there are countless services that are not.\n\nAdderall works great for a lot of people, there are plenty of people that depend on it. It is also a dangerous stimulant that is wickedly over-prescribed. I can understand the pharmacy having hesitations about this. In the not-so-distant past, it was opioids being handed out like candy.

Basically pill mills started up, and doctors at them would write scripts for millions of pills for \"patients\" all over the country that they could never have possibly seen. So as a response Walgreens (and CVS, I believe), the two largest pharmacy chains in the US, have instituted a policy that if you are presenting a new script, the prescriber is not local, and you've not been on the medication before, the pharmacist can, and usually will require that they speak to the doctor to confirm the script, dosage, and DX before dispensing the drug. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get telehealth can be a good thing, but for psychoactive medication that can be abused like stimulants, I think what Walgreens and CVS are doing is a reasonable control mechanism on  MDs/DOs/PAs/APNs just writing scripts like crazy.\n\n#### Comment ID isvvl0w with +5 score by [(Tragically_Fantastic, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/isvvl0w/) (in reply to ID isve0mi):\nI do think it's an ok policy, but basically what this pharmacist said was if they can get in touch with my prescriber, they'll fill it one time, but after that they won't do it again, which feels kinda backwards to me?

The last straw was when I called ahead to make sure they got my 3 year old daughters meds and that they were in stock. I was told yes, and they would be filled by the time I got there in half an hour. I get there, with my daughter who is having problems breathing and needs meds to help clear out her bronchial tubes, the meds arent filled. They will be ready in another half an hour I am told. So I wait. I come back to pick them up and they tell me, \"oops they are out of stock.\" I was livid. \n\nThe time before that they suggested I drive 2 hours away to a store to get an out of stock med. Terrible pharmacy. Ill never go to a walgreens again. Ive gone to meijer for almost a decade now. Best decision I ever made.

I have not had one ounce of ill will or trouble from anyone at Mayo, and I can just go to their pharmacy and get my Rx filled. The worst part is waiting between appointments... The journey from initial consult to CBT appointments and then confirmation with a psych eval and prescribing meds took about a year, not because they were unsure, but because the calendars were (and remain) pretty well booked up. Side note: I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder (recurrent), and that's why I had CBT appointments mixed in there. They had to rule out anxiety before ADHD, but the doc smartly suggested the ADHD was leading to my anxiety, so he is treating the ADHD first. Side side note, for anyone who has had problems with Mayo, I'm sorry you went through that, and this is just my own personal experience.\n\n## Comment ID isxwa5n with +3 score by [(Ryan7032, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/isxwa5n/) (in reply to ID y7elk6):\nGood faith policy?\n\n## Comment ID isyafr6 with +3 score by [(fairybabybug, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/isyafr6/) (in reply to ID y7elk6):\nI don’t take Adderall, but I take another ADHD medication and it took me SOOOOOOO long to get that sucker filled!

I promise we aren’t trying to make life miserable for you. I have adhd too. We have a duty to fill a prescription “in good faith” - I can lose my license otherwise. Example: There are 2 providers from telehealth that I see hundreds and hundreds of Adderall rx from - from their FL, CO, and CA office. I do not see them prescribe *anything* except Adderall. At all. That is a massive red flag for me. They have also (confirmed) never met with any of their patients in person. Another red flag. \n\nI can also understand that seeing a doctor in person is difficult for some people and their schedules- I have to schedule an appt once every 3 months in person myself and it is very difficult with my unpredictable schedule. Bottom line is our license and livelihood is on the line. I think of telehealth as a non-permanent solution while establishing a provider in your community.\n\nLastly, with so many rx now coming from telehealth we are hitting our max of many stimulants that we can order from the DEA on a monthly basis. I cannot take care of our current clientele with the massive influx - we already hit our DEA limit as it is. I usually suggest folks try another pharmacy in a more suburban area (we are urban and Adderall-sense) so you don’t have to go weeks without your medication. \n\nAlso as some others have mentioned, C2s cannot be transferred so you will need to have your prescriber send in a new rx to the pharmacy at which you want to have it filled. \n\nWe’re also extremely understaffed which complicates everything. Please be nice to us. It is hell on earth at most pharmacies right now. \n\n**I would suggest doing mail order pharmacy to get your med (Amazon has a pharmacy) or any independent pharmacy in your area.** I hope this helps clarify some misunderstandings.\n\n### Comment ID isyt1l9 with +2 score by [(Tragically_Fantastic, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/isyt1l9/) (in reply to ID isyqlmt):\nYeah, I understand that.

It used to be sooo easy with my psychiatrist. Dr. Awesome would prescribe my meds for 90 days. So I would call her once every 3 months and l would... get this... only have to leave her a message. All her phone calls went directly to voice mail. And if I left her with my name, meds refilled and phone number to reach me I would get a notification 1 hour later that she sent my script in. I would see her in person every six months as a general check up. So fucking easy. \n\nBut she retired... now i go to my practioner because I'm fucking stable! (Honestly super proud of that accomplishment) however, this new doctor can't prescribe them for 90 days only 30. So every month I have to remember to call their office. Explain to the person on the phone what I need. That yes I have two meds with the same name. I've been through this routine so many times I can pronounce dexemethlyfenidate. She passes it along to the doctor. Doctor approves it and after two days if the pharmacy doesn't call me I have to call them to make sure it got pushed through. Wait another day. Now it takes them a week or so to figure out billing me. By the time they do bill me I forget about it and it ends up getting close to being over due. I pay the bill. And now its time to  start the whole refill process over again.

I wonder if its a blessing in disguise for some people. Guys if you are going through this, do not let it stress you. This is what I did, now be prepared because it is going to sound cheesy because I am a very cheesy person... When Walgreens made me wait 3 weeks for my newly prescribed telehealth Adderall 10mgs during the last few weeks of school (including finals), it made me feel like... worse than poop. I will admit when I got the RX, I had the most surreal sense of calm and peace. Like finally my war was over and I could be treated like a normal person. I didn't have to seek illegal alternatives anymore and feel like a criminal. I could finally get help for my issues and my life was about to improve dramatically. Then doubt crept in, I am not worth this RX, I am not worth getting better, I am a criminal, I am a bad person. I do not deserve to be high functioning like my friends and family. I deserve to live the life I am living. (Obviously have self-esteem issues) With all this thinking floating around in my head, I called Walgreens to see if they ahd received my medication, and this started the whole awkward \"Oh, the medication is on back-order and we do not know when it will be in.\" If a pharmacy wants to fill your RX, the alternative to this wil be \"Oh, your medication is not in stock but go ahead and get your RX sent in so we can get it in stock ASAP.\" There is no such thing as just telling a patient who has been prescribed a medication by a licensed physician that their medication is just not available with no explanation. I did not know this though. It took me weeks to learn this. I thought the medication was really out of stock! It took calling other pharmacies and hearing the condescending tone in their nvoice that made me realize this was a catch all resposne to telehealth prescriptions. They even started denying the other script that I had been getting for over 5 years through telehealth! (Suboxone - huge deal to be cut off).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was so down in the dumps. Then I was taught a new method of thinking by a person I look up to. I started ending all the negative shit. I started saying positive stuff to myself to build myself up... \"You are a pre-med student and will get any treatment you need for any illness you are diagnosed with.\" I looked on reddit for pharmacies that other students of UCF were using and not having trouble getting their rX'S filled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI basically changed up my thinking and if I got a negative response from a pharmacy (I did, a few times...) I simply acted confused (Because deep down I was anyways)... If someone treats you in a way you know for a fact you do not deserve, do not get upset back at them, do not get upset period... It is okay to show confusion, which is justified. Acting confused changed up the dynamics so much that a few pharmacy techs even explained to me what was actually going on, Walgreens had decided to implement a policy where the prescribing doctor had to be within a 30 mile radius of the patient and had seen the patient in the last year. Other pharmacies were following their lead. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a good person. I do however have ADHD. I deserve treatment. I deserve to be treated with respect. Trust me, okay, there is a way to get your RX filled. It may not be through Walgreens, but there is a way if you keep up your spirits and be true to what you deserve. Do not use this as an excuse to get frustrated and head back to the streets for illegal adderall. Fight for your own prescription!!!!  \n\n\nI ended up getting mine filled at a Costco, a pharamcy which has been deemed to be problematic for telehealth prescriptions. However I did not have one single problem with them and they treated me like a decent human being. Yes its 1 hour from my house, but I will gladly pass all the pharmacies that literally are 100% fine with prescribing 1,000,000s of lethal Oxycontin pills but not 1 helpful stimulant or OUD MAT therapy.\n\n## Comment ID j6dvo6h with +1 score by [(PenaltyParticular909, Reddit, 2023-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/j6dvo6h/) (in reply to ID y7elk6):\nThat's why I stopped going to Big box pharmacies because they're always looking at you sideways like they don't drink their bottles of wine as soon as they get home.

Do you want to be a doctor or not?\n\nIf you don't want to be a doctor, you probably won't like actually being a doctor and practicing medicine.  So why would you spend 4 years in medical school, then at least 3 years, probably five or more, in residency just to do a job that you don't like because you think it's got job security?\n\nYou can make a great living as a developer and it still has pretty decent job security. Yes there are a bunch of layoffs in Tech right now, but most tech jobs aren't with tech companies. Neither of my previous employers, both of which are multi-billion dollar Fortune 50 companies laid any tech employees off.\n\nI actually had dreams of following My Father's footsteps and becoming a physician too. I thought about perhaps becoming an ER doc. Then I took my mom to the hospital and had her get treated. I learned two things. One, I'm amazed and have the utmost respect for what physicians do.

I always nervously laughed when people said you shouldn’t go into medicine unless you were super into it, but I was still moderately interesting and it seemed a good, stable path. Tech was intriguing but I didn’t know much about the industry and while I was a hobbyist who really enjoyed it, I wasn’t a CS major so had no internships/experience.\n\nIn the end I managed to get a job as a SWE at a startup and took that instead of going to med school. I did try to defer just in case, but it was after the deadline so unsurprisingly wasn’t successful.\n\nLooking back, I’m very happy with my decision. I’ve gotten to enjoy so much over the last 5 years that I wouldn’t have if I was stuck doing homework every night and dealing with grueling residency hours (and making little/no money).\n\nWhat I do miss is that sometimes tech feels so pointless. Like it doesn’t feel like what I’m good at is a life skill but a corporate skill. Medicine feels so much more useful. And I look at aging grand/parents and how helpful it is that they have a doctor in the family that they can refer to and wish I could provide that for my family.\n\nBut like you’ve said in other comments, you can always go back to medicine if you choose.

I wanted to go to medical school more than anything but I didn’t have the grades because I was working full time as a dish washer and busboy to pay my bills throughout school. I graduated with a useless BS in Bio with a low gpa. Thought about retaking some classes then applying to DO schools, but I knew that wasn’t very realistic. \n\nSo after a year of trying to figure out what to do with my life I decided to get a second bachelors in CS. I graduated and am a junior dev now and I make ok money for the average person, but my salary is peanuts compared to big tech. My job is ok, but I’d be lying if I didn’t say I still wish I could’ve gone to med school. \n\nDon’t choose just based on what you want right now. In 5 years, 10 years, when you retire, do you think you will wish you had been a doctor? If so, go for med school. If not be a dev.\n\nAlso, tech isn’t all sunshine and roses like it was made out to be during the pandemic. Most companies are forcing people to work at least part of the time from the office, there are mass layoffs, and it’s pretty easy to see salaries are being driven down and most likely will continue to considering all of the people going into CS as a result of the hype from the pandemic.\n\n## Comment ID jcig2l5 with +1 score by [(PattayaVagabond, Reddit, 2023-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11sykyt/am_i_insane_for_turning_down_an_acceptance_to_a/jcig2l5/) (in reply to ID 11sykyt):\nyes you are insane\n\n## Comment ID jio9pms with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11sykyt/am_i_insane_for_turning_down_an_acceptance_to_a/jio9pms/) (in reply to ID 11sykyt):\nWhat decision do you choose?

Unthankfully ADMIN is closed as well and  I am sick have been for several days and it is very likely the transformer variant Omicron. I don't know yet because I was to busy trying to remain alive barely able to move except to sip water or gatorade while looking at the ever increasing temperature reading on my thermometer 104.1 is my record so far? Go me? Currently its at 100.9 so much better than it was before.\n\nBut ya since the dirty little secret of holiday day entails that you don't get the pay if you don't work the previous and next shifts between that day. I didn't want to call out I really didn't want to I knew probably by about 7 tonight that there was no way I was going to be able to go in.\n\nWe have to give notice an hour before our shift right? Normally that would be fine just one problem. I open. This morning in 4 hours. I looked up the unum number and called it but an automated message told me UNUM hours and disconnected the call. So clearly not the number I have called before.\n\nI haven't got a test because I can't find a pharmacy nearby that stocked any my mom ordered one offline that said it would get there on friday (when she was ordering it for herself) then it said sunday and now it says TBD)\n\nI seriously considered just calling out ahead of time on Friday Night but figured what kind of lunatic calls out sick over a day before their shift. Now that the temperature isn't as high and hallucinations have faded from the frying of my brain I realize the lunatic is the one who DOESNT call out a day before knowing full well you won't be better a day after having a 104 degree fever.\n\nBut like protocols and all that right. I am pretty damn sure I have it but I have not officially been tested as such have no documented proof to give other than 5 of the 17 people at family christmas party have it. Ive been vaccinated J&J but not boostered (had planned to eventually should have acted sooner) I don't even care about the covid pay my brain and muscles hurt to much for me to care about anything but this hell ending. But I do care about accountability and not being marked as a no call no show because I didn't give an hours notice. When I can't because if I work at 4am and managers enter the building at 345 am wtf am I supposed to do?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. If anyone has the unum number that redirects to the afterhours thing or the teledoc I would appreciate it. If it matters I work in SE in GA\n\n## Comment ID hqwjxln with +16 score by [(cursesonyourmom, Reddit, 2022-01-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/ru2atc/costco_employee_trying_to_call_out_sick_but_cant/hqwjxln/) (in reply to ID ru2atc):\nPer the 2019 employee agreement\n\n4.

I went ahead and looked up each service to verify they are legit, and listed the basic details of each one. \n\nAs always, shop around. Depending on what you need, some services may be cheaper than others.\n\n\n**—** Digital Doctor Services **—**\n\n**K Health**\n\n*        $14 for one appointment with 2 weeks open for questions and follow-up.\n*        $39 per year for unlimited appointments. \n*        Subscription not required for the $14 appointments. \n*        You can get labs and prescriptions.\n*        Can use with or without insurance.\n*        Monthly subscription service for anxiety/depression with benefits of normal yearly subscription + mental health specific consultations, treatment plans, referrals, and monthly medication delivery. Must consult app to sign up and get approved for this particular service.\n\n\n**HeyDoctor**\n       \n*        $20 for most appointments, though costs can vary depending on what you need an appointment for. Most typical appointments are $20, but check the website for all prices.\n*        You can get labs and prescriptions \n*        Can use with or without insurance.\n \n\n*The prices of the next two digital doctor services are extremely comparable to typical cash prices for seeing a regular doctor. Not all that budget friendly in my opinion, but I’ll list them and their prices since they were in the comment section of the previous post.*\n\n\n**Teladoc**  \n\n*        $49 or less for typical doctor consultations.\n*        $75 or less for Dermatology consultations\n*        $80 per visit for licensed Therapist.\n*        $95-$200 per visit with licensed Psychiatrist.\n*        Can provide prescriptions.\n\n\n**Doctor on Demand**\n\n*        $75 for 15 minute consultation with doctor.\n*        $129-$179 for 25-50 minute consultation with psychologist. \n*        $299 for 45 minute consultation with Psychiatrist.\n*        $129 for 15 minute follow-up with psychiatrist.\n*        Consultations can be extended for additional fees.\n*        Prices above are cash prices, but this service also accepts insurance.\n*        Can provide prescriptions.\n\n\n*In addition to the services listed above, you should also consult your insurance, if you have any, to see what telehealth services they might offer. You may already be paying for this type of service in your insurance package.*\n\n\n**—** Migraine Only **—**\n\n**Cove**\n\n*        $4 monthly subscription fee.\n*        Migraine-specific help.\n*        Not for other medical issues.\n*        Can get prescriptions.\n\n\n**—** In-Person Medical Help **—**\n\n**Planned Parenthood**\n\n*        Discounted and free services for sexual health, birth control, routine testing, pregnancy, and more. \n\n**FQHC Clinics**\n\n*        I couldn’t find too much about this, other than that it is considered a low-cost health service. It’s worth a try to look it up and what might be available where you live.\n\n**Cash Discounts**\n\n*        Some doctors accept a discounted cash payment for treatment, so shop around where you live to see what options might be available to you.\n\n**Local Health Districts**\n\n*        You can get low cost or free vaccinations at local health districts. \n*        Also ask them about other preventative vaccines, like HPV and Flu Shots. It doesn’t hurt to check if your town/city offers free or discounted preventative vaccines.\n\n\n**—** Medication Discounts **—**\n\n**GoodRX**\n\n*        Medication discount up to 80%.\n*        Lists the after-discount cost of all local pharmacies, as some are cheaper than others.\n*        Use discount coupons when you pick up your prescriptions from your pharmacy.\n*        Will call your pharmacy for you if they initially refuse to accept it, or don’t understand what it is.\n*        Free service. No subscription needed.\n\n**Blink Health**\n\n*        Buy online and pick up medications at your pharmacy, or have them delivered.\n*        Free delivery.\n*        Can get consult with doctor if you don’t currently have a prescription.\n*        Free service, no subscription needed.\n*        See their website for a list of participating pharmacies.\n*        Can request refills, transfer prescriptions, and consult a licensed pharmacist with any questions.\n\n**Manufacturer’s Website**\n\n*        Every medication manufacturer may offer huge discounts on their medications on their own websites.\n\n**Grocery store discount programs**\n\n*        Your local grocery stores, including Walmart, likely have prescription discount plans, so make sure to ask your pharmacy about theirs!\n*        Typically it’s a yearly fee to sign up for these services. For instance, at Kroger it is $36/year. \n\n**Honeybee Health**\n\n*        Online discount pharmacy.\n*        No insurance accepted.\n*        Free Delivery.\n*        Offers medications at wholesale prices.\n\n**Pharmacychecker**\n\n*        Price comparison service for online pharmacies.\n*        Free to use.\n*        Does not provide medications, just helps you compare prices.\n\n**The Pill Club**\n\n*        Birth Control Only.\n*        $0 medication with most insurance.\n*        $15 consultation fee + cost of medication with no insurance, or if out of market insurance.\n*        Free medication delivery with a few feminine goodies.\n\n**Nurx**\n\n*        Sexual Health only.\n*        $15 consultation fees for each various service. The $15 consultation fees cannot be billed to insurance.\n*        $0 typically for birth control through insurance.\n*        As low as $15 per month for birth control without insurance.\n*        Testing prices vary depending on the test and if you do or do not have insurance. Consult their FAQ page for detailed test prices.\n*        Medications can be billed to insurance.\n*        Provides sexual health medications, including birth control and Plan B.\n*        Provides home testing kits for sexual-related illness such as STI testing and HPV screening.\n*        Can also order lab testing if preferred over home testing.\n\n**Simple Health**\n\n*        Birth Control Only.\n*        $0 prescription with most insurance.\n*        $20 annual fee for the care package, includes initial consultation with doctor.\n*        As low as $15 per month prescription cost with no insurance.\n*        Free shipping.\n*        Automatic Refills.\n\n\n**—** Prescription Skin Care **—**\n\n**Curology**\n\n*        $19.95 per month, plus shipping.\n*        Includes ability to talk to provider\n*        Includes customized skin care formula.\n*        Includes cleanser and moisturizer.\n*        Includes 2 minute skincare routine to follow with the above products.\n\n\nWith any prescription that is more than you’re able to afford, you should also ask your pharmacist about alternative options, as they likely know something cheaper, or they can point out an over-the-counter medication or supplement that can help in the meantime if you can’t afford a doctor. I’ve personally had my pharmacist show me what over the counter medications would help with anxiety medication withdrawal that happens with certain anxiety and depression medications when you stop taking it. They helped me pick a vitamin that would help keep the anxiety at bay a bit so I didn’t have a complete breakdown while waiting for more meds. Pharmacists are a fantastic resource, and they’re happy to help.\n\nAlso, try applying for free healthcare. It is available for people in hardship, and there is no shame in getting help from the government when you need it. It doesn’t hurt to just see if you qualify. I’ve used it before, and it can help relieve a little of the stress from poverty to at least know you’re covered if something happens. \n\nThanks everyone for all your input on the previous post. If you know of other free and low-cost medical services, please comment below and tell us about them!\n\nEdit: formatting\n\nEdit2: Another user has had success using GoodRX at Publix. If a Publix refuses it, call customer support for GoodRX so they can talk to the pharmacy for you.\n\n## Comment ID fdk9hse with +272 score by [(walker21619, Reddit, 2020-01-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/elryxp/ive_compiled_all_the_lowcost_medical_resources/fdk9hse/) (in reply to ID elryxp):\nDamn this is possibly one of the best sets of data I’ve seen on reddit.

You have truly helped me more than you could know by posting this. I've been worrying and fretting over seeing a mental health professional for over a year because every place I've called and looked into is a minimum $150-$200 just for a consult/diagnosis, and I simply do not have that kind of money to spend after monthly bills and what have you, even with my insurance I have to meet a deductible before I get any coverage for the services I need. I've been battling with worsening anxiety and symptoms of adult ADHD, and have felt nothing short of hopeless about it. But now I've just signed up for K Health and am currently waiting to speak to a doctor now, all at an *affordable* price.\n\nOP, you're a rockstar. Thank you *thank you.* And thank you to everyone who contributed to this amazing list!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit/update: after filling in my info, waited \\~25 mins for a doctor to speak to me. Did a 2 minute meet via video call, then went back to chat where he diagnosed me officially and is now sending medication to try right to my door. I can reach out any time for help or with questions, and he will follow up in a couple weeks. I'm in awe how easy this was, and the relief of not having to worry how I'll afford this is overwhelming. Give this a try if needed, folks! Good luck to you all!\n\nEdit 2: Sorry, I should clarify I’m being sent anti-anxiety medication, not something for ADHD. The doctor could not prescribe me a controlled substance through the app but could diagnose and refer me to somebody in person who could. I hope this helps!\n\n### Comment ID fdkiwtw with +41 score by [(annetteisshort, Reddit, 2020-01-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/elryxp/ive_compiled_all_the_lowcost_medical_resources/fdkiwtw/) (in reply to ID fdkhzuk):\nI know exactly what that is like, and I’m so sorry you had to go through that.

I think we’re conditioned at this point to not trust anything like this, because it just seems too good to be true, and life is rarely that easy for people in our shoes.\n\n### Comment ID fdlq3k7 with +10 score by [(Hobo-and-the-hound, Reddit, 2020-01-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/elryxp/ive_compiled_all_the_lowcost_medical_resources/fdlq3k7/) (in reply to ID fdkhzuk):\nIf you don’t mind me asking, what medication?

You pay a one time $59 fee to join, and then they subsidize the costs of your therapy appointments (if you see one of the providers listed on the website). Therapy appointments are $30-60 a session depending on the provider and your financial need. This is 1/3-1/2 of what you'd pay a therapist out of pocket without mental health insurance.\n\nThis is specifically for therapy, not psychiatry. A regular doctor can write a RX for psychiatric meds, you don't have to see an expensive psychiatrist for this.  So if you're wanting medication and therapy, go to a regular doctor for the meds, and use a low-cost therapy resource.\n\nIf you are on Medicaid or Medicare, community mental health agencies will give you free mental health therapy and usually free psychiatric medication also.\n\n### Comment ID fdkr0iy with +13 score by [(annetteisshort, Reddit, 2020-01-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/elryxp/ive_compiled_all_the_lowcost_medical_resources/fdkr0iy/) (in reply to ID fdkqrut):\nThis is fantastic info.

I used to manage the private practice for a psychiatrist. I dealt with insurance every day for 3 years. Still have a hard time navigating healthcare related stuff. And I didn’t know many of these resources. \n\nAlso, can confirm that going through the manufactures website is super helpful. You can find specific coupons and resources not available on GoodRx or through your pharmacy. I take Vyvanse for ADHD, which does not have a generic yet. With a coupon (without insurance) it costs almost $300 for a month supply. I found a program called Shire Cares (through the manufacture) that gives you a coupon to get Vyvanse (and some of their other meds) at no cost if you make less than around $80,000. It took around 3 months for it all to go through (they make it difficult for a reason), but I did end up getting it! As a grad student, this was a lifesaver.

YMMV depending on location and. Co-op structure.\n\nCommunity Health Centers (not Health Department) are sliding scale fee for all medical visits, they also provide psych services (counseling, group sessions, medication management , prescription's) they generally have on site pharmacy as well. If your unable to pay some will bill you .\n\nEdited to add : Forgot to mention larger hospital networks sometimes have their own \"insurance\" plans .

Also, I’ve updated one of my responses on the other post but Publix DOES accept GoodRX. If a pharmacy location rejects your discount card or coupon, it’s because the pharmacy manager or district manager is forcing everyone’s hand into not mentioning other discount programs or accepting said discounts, which is NOT okay. If this happens to you, immediately transfer your prescription(s) to a different pharmacy. If this is a regular occurrence at multiple pharmacies in a certain area, go to a different chain or if another city is close enough try one there. I’ve had this happen many times to me when I worked in that field and I feel like it’s totally unfair.\n\nAnother thing to note would be that if they reject your discount one time, it may not be the same another time. If they tell you their price for a prescription is cheaper than your GoodRX price, this is for a SCRIPT BY SCRIPT BASIS. If they tell you this and their price is cheaper it does NOT mean you can’t use GoodRX there for your other scripts that are cheaper via GoodRx or another site.\n\nAlso, a coupon is different from a discount/savings program. A coupon is something you can ONLY get from a manufacturer website (not all discounts from these sites are coupons though) or through your provider if said manufacturer has given them coupons, or sometimes through other programs. It is MANDATORY that these are accepted. An example of a coupon vs savings/discount would be that a coupon would state you can get x quantity for free, but a discount would just lower the cost. Coupons almost always make your prescription cheaper than savings/discount sites and must always be accepted.\n\n### Comment ID fdlzkv3 with +2 score by [(annetteisshort, Reddit, 2020-01-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/elryxp/ive_compiled_all_the_lowcost_medical_resources/fdlzkv3/) (in reply to ID fdkmumt):\nYou’re fantastic!\n\n## Comment ID fdkojpe with +9 score by [(ThePersnicketyBitch, Reddit, 2020-01-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/elryxp/ive_compiled_all_the_lowcost_medical_resources/fdkojpe/) (in reply to ID elryxp):\nJust a suggested edit - Publix absolutely *does* take GoodRX!

So my question is, I found a doctor that will inject my depo shot for cheap but on this list it says that Publix doesn't honor the goodrx coupons for birth control, so should I use something else? Has anyone had experience getting the depo shot from any of the sites mentioned, I checked out the pill club but it doesn't have depo shot as an option which makes sense, but I didn't know if anyone else had any ideas? Also, has anyone had any experience with getting a yearly gynecology appointment without insurance? I don't have Planned Parenthood in my area sadly so I can't use them.\n\n### Comment ID fdkil8b with +6 score by [(annetteisshort, Reddit, 2020-01-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/elryxp/ive_compiled_all_the_lowcost_medical_resources/fdkil8b/) (in reply to ID fdkg2xx):\nAre there other pharmacies in your area, like Kroger, Walmart, Albertsons, Smith’s, Walgreens, CVS?

When you download the app, you make a profile and the AI, K, will help you out by asking a bunch of questions about your history and symptoms. You pay $14, and then she will connect you to a doctor. Takes 10-20 minutes to have a doctor connect to you.\n\nOnce the doctor joins chat, they confirm your symptoms, and ask any additional questions they need to know. If you’ve got an anti-depressant you already like that works well with you, let them know what that is, and how long you’ve been off of it. They’ll let you know what they want to prescribe. They should be able to send the prescription directly to your pharmacy, or you can get it from K Health and have it mailed to you. From other comments, it sounds like the cost of meds from the app was comparable to a pharmacy with a discount coupon. \n\nHope this helps. :)\n\n#### Comment ID fdmgc2h with +2 score by [(hologram_girl, Reddit, 2020-01-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/elryxp/ive_compiled_all_the_lowcost_medical_resources/fdmgc2h/) (in reply to ID fdluy11):\nOmg, this is amazing.

For example your doctor might refer you for imaging like an ultrasound. You call the radiology place and they say the ultrasound will be something like $250 or $100+ with the Medicare rebate. If you're not very low income and don't have a healthcare card, they'll just say that's what it costs. But if you call a different imaging centre like Capital, they're usually bulk billing for anyone, not just healthcare card holders or pensioners. If that helps anyone. You can use the request form even if the header is a different radiology place.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID j8x33mp with +3 score by [(No_Pomegranate_3709, Reddit, 2023-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/elryxp/ive_compiled_all_the_lowcost_medical_resources/j8x33mp/) (in reply to ID elryxp):\nWhat online doctors help prescribe medication for mental health like Xanax ?

You can import up to a 90-day supply for personal use if you have a prescription from a US Dr. I’ve had some of my meds that my insurance refused to cover and they were just too expensive here, I got them from a pharmacy in India and they worked just as well.

I'm just a Certified Pharmacy Technician who has been working for 8 years in pharmacy and I want to help people. Most of these will *NOT* work with a government funded plans (VA, Medicaid, Medicare, etc.).  \n\n[NeedyMeds](https://www.needymeds.org/) compiles numerous savings cards for brand name medications. Some of these cards, I see every day.  \n\nExamples of common ones I see frequently.  There's also patient assistance programs that, if you meet income requirements, you can get **FREE** medication directly from the manufacturer. I've seen patients get 3-4 month supplies of insulin without spending a dime.\n\n[Novolog insulin](https://www.needymeds.org/coupons.taf?_function=name_list&gname=insulin%20aspart%20rDNA%20origin)\n\n[Eliquis blood thinner](https://www.needymeds.org/coupons.taf?_function=name_list&gname=apixaban)  \n\nA lot of these kind of discounts will work with your commercial insurance, or if you have no insurance at all. These can be useful especially this time of year when your deductible has reset and you may need to spend $2,000 or more out of pocket. \n\nAlways check with your pharmacist if you're preferred pharmacy accepts discount cards.

I have had 8-10 canker sores in my throat and all over my mouth nonstop for the past few months. I don't ever have normal, non-painful days anymore. \n\nWell, I finally gave in and went to the doctor. Even the low income clinic here is a $60 visit. She gave me no answers. She told me it's stress related. Well, yes, I'm poor and stressed and that isn't something I can control or fix right now. No solutions, but I still have to pay 60. \n\nThis isn't the first time I felt like going to the doctor was fruitless. I'm to the point where I don't think I will ever go back to the doctor unless I am throwing up blood. It's all so useless.\n\nSo, my fellow poor friends, what's your red line? When do you decide it's time to see a doctor? I'm feeling like a fool right now for going.\n\n## Comment ID f6d8ujh with +568 score by [(grapholalia, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6d8ujh/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nUnless I'm bleeding, dying, or have been sick for months--I avoid the doctor.

I don't agree with the hyped-up cost of medicine in general, but you can't really judge the quality of healthcare by the end result when the presentation can vary. Had the user actually had something like renal cell carcinoma, $600 for a cancer diagnosis might seem cheap.

My doctor advised me to go to the ER for the hospital where he consults. It took four hours for the NP at the ER  to call him-after additional tests and meds I didn’t need.

A regular gp can do it, but if the results indicate an issue you really need a specialist to diagnose what type and treat it. Look into state funded insurance or low income federal,  because you will need it. Unfortunately autoimmune disease is not so unlike cancer in that it can be very life threatening and won't generally improve on its own. I have heard of some people getting some relief by following an autoimmune diet where high inflammation foods like nightshades and refined carbohydrates are avoided, but it's only complimentary to treatment obviously.

One thing that helped me is those cough drops with actual numbing medicine in them - Cepacol is the brand, I think. They’re a little on the pricey side for cough drops (like $5ish I think for a pack of 16 or so?) but were a godsend towards the end of a rough day when I was simply at my wit’s end with the pain. Definitely not ideal, but not too bad if you use them sparingly for when you really can’t stand it.\n\nI also later found out I got more prone to them because I was prone to dry mouth - which, funny enough, was a side effect of a medication I was taking. I started using that biotene stuff regularly and drinking a TON of water and it really helped. Your sores might be due to any number of things, but if they’re related to dry mouth, that’d be pretty easy to determine and then relatively easy to fix. \n\nI’m so sorry you’re going through this, canker sores hurt SO much and any health issue without answers is maddening.

Brush your teeth with baking soda at night before bed. Swishing baking soda water around your mouth during the day will also help too. \n\nIf you have a night where you know you can sleep in, plan to sleep as long as possible. I would even say take a benedryl or some cheaper sleep time aid just so you’re relaxed for a long time. Don’t do this regularly though because the ingredient in it means your brain doesn’t dream as much as it normally should do overtime you’ll feel more exhausted. For me I feel best if once a week I sleep for 10+ hours but that’s just me. If I’m not sleeping enough, it’s usually I need to wash my bedsheets or something. \n\nGood luck and honestly see where you can rearrange your schedule for your health, overlap days off if needed or be on that hunt for the elusive better paying job.\n\n### Comment ID f6e5gxn with +4 score by [(FiggNewton, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6e5gxn/) (in reply to ID f6dwhur):\nI take benedryl for everything.

You pay $20 a year for access to real doctors via your phone. It’s only $1 per visit too! Basically, you chat with a doctor, and if need be, you take pictures with your phone if they need to see what you’re describing. I used it last week for an infection, got diagnosed, but before I could start the required medication, the doctor ordered a lab test for me at my local clinic (LabCorps). This was to see if I was healthy enough for the medication. Once the clinic sent back my results to the doctors at 98point6, they were able to prescribe me the medication and get it sent to my local pharmacy. I used GoodRx and brought the price of the medication down from $20 to $8. All in all, I spent $63 ($20 for the yearly 98point6 membership + $1 for initial visit + $33 for the blood test + $1 for second visit to discuss results and get prescription + $8 for the actual medicine). With my insurance, I would’ve paid more than that on just the doctor’s visit. I think it does jump to $100-something for the yearly membership with them after the first year, but I will gladly pay that next year. Obviously if you have an emergency you should totally call 911, but for something simple, 98point6 will do the trick. Really glad I ran across them and will continue spreading the word.

Low B12/zinc/folate/iron can cause those.  Cheap fix that might help.\n\nAlong with avoiding ALL acidic foods and ingredients.  Are you regularly taking any over the counter meds?  Aspirin/NSAID, and various other things can also trigger them.\n\nI used to get them every time I ever bit my tongue or cheek - for 30+ years - - they disappeared permanently when I was put on a one week series of Valtrex (Valacyclovir) pills for a corneal ulcer.  Since it's usually a herpes virus, that may work for you too.

We were literally there for about 30 mins, including the wait time. They looked her over, took BP and weight, then told her they believed she had a severely pulled muscle. No scans, no blood work, nothing... Basically a quick exam.\n\nAlmost every time I have been sick and tried to go to the Dr I have gotten a bill and the insurance did not cover it because they claim that they do not cover anything that would be considered \"Investigative\". In my mind, maybe I am wrong but, when I go to the dr to find out what is wrong it would be medically necessary for him to investigate to come to a conclusion.... \n\n* I also pay what I consider an insane amount of money to have insurance only to have to fight with them every single time then they decide that basically anything is not \"Medically Necessary\". Do not feel bad, if you obtain a higher salary and insurance, it doesn't get much better.

And then they put me to sleep and did an upper endoscopy, and when I woke up he just said he wants to see me again to go over what they found, and they probably ran the wrong test, I should've been more specific (I was very specific with all my symptoms) and he walked away. And then later found out I wouldn't be able to get an appointment for 3 months, so I just bailed. They also prescribed a compounded medication that they weren't very sure would work and was expensive so fuck that I'm not taking something that might just make it worse I'll live with this as I have my whole life I guess.

Spending $1000 on insulin is nothing compared to even one DKA episode ($100k bare minimum), plus any loss of income while you're recovering, plus any loss of reputation for calling in sick (let's not pretend that doesn't happen), plus the cost of late fees since you lost income and couldn't pay on time\n\nIf there is anyone UNDER 10 YEARS OLD in your home, YOU MUST KEEP ON HAND LIQUID TYLENOL AND LIQUID IBUPROFEN AT ALL TIMES AND IN ENOUGH AMOUNT that you'll have enough for 18 hours for the biggest one, but ideally all of them separately.\n\n#\n\nPredicting the future is required to conclusively know those factors, but if you sit down and think about it, you'd just be comparing yourself to your own past behavior.\n\n## Comment ID f6fr9h1 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6fr9h1/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\n[deleted]\n\n## Comment ID f6fs4zv with +1 score by [(PatchworkStar, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6fs4zv/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nI have hypothyroidism.

I rarely go to the doctor myself because of the cost. I lived with a double hernia for 5 years before I finally got enough money for the scan and the co-pay for the operation. The only time I've been to the ER was when I got hit by a car on my bike as a kid. A couple of years ago I had food poisoning really badly and was considering going, but it cleared up by the next day and although I felt weak, I was able to rest and take the day off work. \n\nI get those cold sores also. Here are some things that have helped me.\n\n\"Canker Cover\" patches. They absorb moisture and turn into a gelatin-like bubble to protect the sore. It helps a ton because the sores then don't get irritated by teeth touching them and such. If they're inside near your lips, they can be a little cumbersome because they'll be bumping your teeth as you try to talk, but still manageable. Link:  [https://www.amazon.com/DenTek-Canker-Cover-Patch-Relief/dp/B017GQYYXO](https://www.amazon.com/DenTek-Canker-Cover-Patch-Relief/dp/B017GQYYXO) \n\nOil-pulling: Take a tablespoon of coconut oil and slowly swish it around your mouth for about 20 minutes. You don't have to gargle, just gently move it around. It will absorb impurities and help your mouth get healthier. I did it every day for a couple of weeks and then went to once every 2 weeks, although I've neglected that for a few months now. I need to get back to it. Spit the oil out after 20 minutes, preferably in the trash with some paper towels. It solidifies at room temperature and may clog pipes. \n\nHydrogen peroxide rinse: Make a 50/50 mix of hydrogen peroxide and water and swish it around for about a minute. \n\nI can understand how you feel for having gone and not getting any help from the doctor. I get frustrated about that stuff too. I use Insight Timer app to do guided meditation to help me relax. I also take Magnesium and Theanine supplements that help with mood.

Do whatever you possibly can to afford health insurance - the lower-tier plans should be free with subsidies and the silver tier plans should be free or nearly free, especially if you're in the kind of straits that most folks here find themselves in.  Don't worry too much about coverage for severe injury and accidents since those will bankrupt you even with a pretty good silver plan (and even some gold plans, depending on whether or not you can afford to soak a few thousand dollars of deductible on top of the actual costs), what you want to make sure you get are at least a couple of biannual checkups/physicals for free, and ideally some kind of limited copay for specialist consults.\n\nYou will lose a ton of money by not going to see a doctor to get preventable illnesses and conditions addressed before they can become serious problems.  Infections lead to lost work.  Lost work leads to lost pay.  Lost pay can lead to a debt spiral that can literally take decades to escape.\n\nIn the meantime, make sure you are taking a daily multivitamin.  It's possible that malnutrition is contributing to these sores, and making it difficult for them to heal.  Shoestring \"bread and water\" budgets don't often make room for crucial micronutrients, and a once-a-day multi can help limit the damage.\n\nYou may also want to look into a bottle of Listerine or other mouth cleanser.  If you've got multiple open sores, that's bacteria and clearing your mouth and a throat gargle could help.  You can also try rinsing and gargling with warm salt water.\n\n## Comment ID f6hj2k7 with +1 score by [(heyieatjunk, Reddit, 2019-11-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6hj2k7/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nI feel really sorry for you.

It’s pretty common for me to get 5-10 in my mouth. So I did a bunch of research once in desperation and found someone say to take L-Lysine, a vitamin and that it cuts the healing time. I took it and oh my god does it work. Now I take it whenever it feels like I’m about to get some and it prevents it.\n\nApparently some people have a vitamin deficiency, I guess from a lack of it in the diet that makes them more common. I get them when I’m stressed because stress can cause your immune system to weaken and allows the virus that lives in your mouth to run rampant. Anyway, take it, it’s cheap and it works. Also, get some numbing spray for the throat that’s what I do when they are killing me and I can’t sleep.\n\nEdit: P.S. do not gargle with peroxide, peroxide does kill bacteria but it also damages cells and since the wound is in your mouth the virus just gets more contact with the open wound causing them to get worse. Salt water can help, but gods does it hurt and I’ve never had them go away from it.

(I was curious about dosage so I looked it up before taking.)\n\n## Comment ID f6hlpds with +1 score by [(bubblesfix, Reddit, 2019-11-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6hlpds/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nWhen I'm dying and they force me to go.

I was having persistent, painful stomach issues this summer and finally made an appointment. Said it was probably stress (tried to give me life advice about taking time for myself, finding a less stressful job) and wanted me to do some additional testing. But for that 15 minute appointment, I got a $450 bill which has thrown me off for months. I was afraid of how much the additional appointments, x-rays etc, would be so I'm just holding out until I hopefully get better insurance.\n\nETA: If anyone has insurance with the teledoctor feature, I used that when I had an ear infection recently and that was only $10 and they prescribed an antibiotic.\n\n## Comment ID f6i4fct with +1 score by [(Nikeagogo79, Reddit, 2019-11-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6i4fct/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nI get cluster headaches and migraines and I absolutely refuse to see anyone for them because, well, I had Medicaid for a bit there. I also had really great private insurance. Now, I am uninsured but we are looking at my partner's coverage through work- but, on Medicaid: literally everyone I ever saw for this treated me like shit and really not much ever got done. The private insurance? Totally different story. It has been probably 10, maybe 15 years since I last went to an ER for this- but my god, no. Not ever. Not only do they treat you like shit, but god help you if you self advocate enough to \"Uh, opoids make these worse, and if you think imatrex is a party drug maybe you shouldn't be a nurse.\" it's mildly satisfying but doesn't help. lol   \n\n\nIn any case, while maxalt and imatrex kinda help- the two things that do ACTUALLY work: well, one is illegal but being studied for it. The other is way off label but legal- but, being treated like a drug seeker because you asked for a steroid shot to the back of your head's a trip, too. (And I found out BOTH of those things while on private insurance because, apparently you've got to have money to be seen as a human being and it happened I got a neurologist who not only did, but was familiar with them. Go freaking figure.)\n\n## Comment ID f6i56ce with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-11-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6i56ce/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nFish meds.... If you have sick fish, you give them fish meds. Apparently they are the same ones given to humans, so when my fish are sick... I used to give them fish meds. :)\n\nAs far as your canker sores go, do you drink juice or eat a lot of citrus? That always causes them for me. I think some people react to spicy food also. I think there's a product called camphophenique that helps. There's something else out there also that coats over it until it heals.\n\n## Comment ID f6i6diz with +1 score by [(galaxystarsmoon, Reddit, 2019-11-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6i6diz/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nI don't know if anyone has said this and I'm not scrolling through 600+ comments to find out, but try changing your toothpaste.

And that is\n\nDoctor Office Visits\n\nAND\n\nLab Work\n\nAre two different departments. A doctor is only as good as the lab work requested. \n\nIf I just have a cold, I dont bother going because there isnt anything the doctor can do. I just need to have plenty of fluids - clean water and maybe some orange juice, plenty of rest. And take things for symptoms.\n\nIf I suspect I have the flu OR I am frequently getting sick every month or so, I will talk to a doctor but with the impression they will run blood work.\n\nDo these things cost money? Yeah. Sometimes clinics are the way to go since it might be cheaper. 60-100 $ for an officr visit and 60-100% for lab work. It does help to have a clinic you like going to and building up a report with them and as they get to know more about you medically it can help to have a quicker diagnosis.\n\nOr\n\nUrgent Care / ER, I tell them I have no insurance and bill me later. The bill can range from a couple hundred dollars to 1k, unless you get admitted then good luck. Try not to get admitted unless its life threatening. The upside to this is you dont have to pay out of pocket right then and there. I have did this in between jobs.\n\n## Comment ID f6jlu1w with +1 score by [(callmekohai, Reddit, 2019-11-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6jlu1w/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nOff topic, but as someone with cronic canker sores for years, using an antiseptic mouth rinse after every meal (and usually brushing and flossing after every meal) helped a bunch. Orajel has a great one, but if thats too pricy, salt water will also work well to sanitize your mouth. Using Oral anesthetic/Benzocaine really helps with the sores you can reach to apply it to, and it numbs the surrounding area to help with overall pain\n\n## Comment ID f6elw2o with +1 score by [(comehomedarling, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6elw2o/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nRe: your health: I’m guessing you have looked up remedies, so you might already tried this one—gargle warm salt water?\n\n## Comment ID f6eruxg with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6eruxg/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nNever.

Plus, daycare requires doctors note if we wanted to get a partial refund on the tuition for missing days - this app allows us (at no cost since it is offered as a benefit) from the comfort of our home get in touch with a doctor at any time of the day.

The dr said to get him tested for covid. What?! He had an ear at infection not covid. He has really bad allergies that causes fluid in his ears. Well it caused an ear infection in his left ear. The dr said it is probably a cold causing the redness in the ear and will go away in a few days. I told her no it’s an ear infection and he needs antibiotics . She wouldn’t help. I took him to his pediatrician she confirmed the ear infection and prescribed antibiotics. I was hoping the app would of been useful but it’s a joke along with the crappy drs.",

I not only will no longer use this but I’m going share with everyone I know not to use! Both visits all the Doctors cared about was COVID and pushing the COVID vaccination. We understand being concerned with COVID but not everything is COVID! And when they are told you already tested negative and they continue only talking about COVID. That’s unacceptable! Also no vaccination is supposed to be given to anyone who is sick. Adults, children, infants, the elderly.  It doesn’t matter and a medical doctor SHOULD KNOW THIS! They did nothing to help at either visit. And we mean nothing! They didn’t listen to any of the list of things that you answer before logging in. Anything said while chatting. Neither Doctor ever got on the video chat like they are supposed to do. Oh and the wait times were way longer then estimated. So if you want no help, to waste your money, and to waste an hour or more off your day then this is perfect! Seems like a great idea to get seen without going to a hospital, urgent care ,etc. or your primary can’t get you in and you don’t have to risk catching something else. BUT they do nothing to actually treat you. After both visits we had the family members taken to our local urgent care and both times they needed medical treatment and or medication.  Medication that should have and could have been given through the doctors on this app. Also 98.6 sends you emails asking how you’re visit went. Both times the surveys were answered with the truth and how bad the service was. Do you think we heard anything back? NOPE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! \n\nSo This review is being written and we hope that it will be a cautionary tale about this app and what to expect.",

We pay out of pocket for routine labs and do everything they ask, but each appointment makes him feel worse than the last. They also act like they’re going to cut him off and stop treating him any day now, which would likely trigger permanent harm and complications due to lack of access to his maintenance meds, which are safe and he’s been using for many years. \n\nIt’s time to start shopping around for a new telemedicine service.",

I sent details and pictures of the area of concern and all I wanted was advice on whether or not I needed to be seen in person. The doctor rudely told me that he couldn’t help because I was treated for the same thing 7 months ago. He said to continue to do the things I was already doing to treat the problem. No other advice given. Turns out I have a massive infection in my lymph node and needed to be out on antibiotics immediately. No testing done at urgent care, I was simply diagnosed by my symptoms and the doctor looking at the are. Same I provided to the DR in this service.

Then there were layoffs and more employees at all levels left on their own. Goals have not changed. More have been added and all dead lines were kept the same. Of course when these deadlines are not met the next company meeting is negative with a lot of general blaming and saying we all just need to work harder. Communication overall has been terrible with \"we don't know yet\" being the usual answer for any concerns. Weeks without answers. Any answers are just as rushed and poorly thought out as the changes. This toxic attitude is starting with the top level but you can see it affecting teams as they feel more pressure.",

I've seen leadership act on feedback given by employees, and continual improvements made in policies and processes, such as our interview process. Leadership and the company doesn't get things right 100% of the time, but they are passionate about making improvements when opportunities arise and when we are put in situations where the company needs to adapt.",

In addition, I saw at least three specific situations in the last few months where the CTO acted with questionable professional integrity.\r\n* There is not strong alignment between Product Management and Engineering (although, it is improving slowly).\r\n* The annual compensation adjustments are primarily based on the initial salary an employee negotiates when they start working at the company.

There are about 10 weeks off per year between PTO, monthly personal days and all-company summer and winter breaks. PTO is use-it-or-lose it which encourages people to take time off.\r\n* The core value of \"relentless improvement\" is a big aspect of the culture -- people are striving to do better.\r\n* High-quality user experiences are valued, and customer-facing issues are taken seriously.",

I've seen leadership act on feedback given by employees, and continual improvements made in policies and processes, such as our interview process. Leadership and the company doesn't get things right 100% of the time, but they are passionate about making improvements when opportunities arise and when we are put in situations where the company needs to adapt.",

      "# [Powered Consumer Health Experience – Transcarent](https://transcarent.com/press-releases/transcarent-introduces-wayfinding-an-ai-powered-consumer-health-experience)\nSan Francisco, CA May 15, 2024 - Today, Transcarent, the One Place for Health and Care, announced WayFinding, a new experience that seamlessly combines generative AI with instant access to care providers to integrate benefits navigation, clinical guidance, and care delivery on one easy to use platform. WayFinding personalizes each person’s experience, orienting and guiding them through their health and care journeys, with human support never more than a tap away.\n\nWayFinding provides Members with personalized support and guidance, beginning with questions about what’s covered and what it might cost. It moves them seamlessly to the next best clinical action to take through specific guidance, and then instantly connects them to medical professionals or provides direct access into digital point solutions uniquely suited to address specific issues.\n\nAccording to a 2023 KFF poll, more than 50 percent of insured adults in America say it is difficult to understand at least some aspect of their health insurance. Forty percent of Americans with employer sponsored coverage said they didn’t understand what their health insurance covers, while 27 percent lacked understanding about specific terms their health insurance uses such as \"deductible,\" \"copay,\" and \"co-insurance.\" Increasing a person’s access to benefits information is critical as uncertainty often leads to unexpected cost, and medical debt is the number one cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. Most Americans find their healthcare to be more confusing, more complex, and more costly than ever before and getting worse, not better, with 70 percent feeling failed by the healthcare system.\n\nWayFinding addresses this complexity, uniquely combining new advancements made possible through generative AI with better information and on-demand access to clinicians, along with access to virtual point solutions and local in-person care. With WayFinding, Transcarent Members can access the care they deserve and employers can be confident their benefits are being used efficiently and effectively.\n\n“Imagine if you could go to one place, 24 hours a day, to access all your benefits, get the unbiased medical guidance you need, and then have instant access to a doctor or other healthcare professional or connect to the leading point solutions with no separate logins and membership cards needed. That’s what we’ve all been dreaming about and today Transcarent is delivering on that vision,” said Glen Tullman, Chief Executive Officer of Transcarent. “This is not just better than traditional navigation, it’s completely different. It’s like moving from a flip phone to an iPhone. The flip phone did one thing. The iPhone does everything. And we’re doing it all at half the price of traditional navigators.”\n\nThe launch of WayFinding builds on Transcarent's earlier work to responsibly incorporate AI-enabled care into the Member experience, starting with the acquisition of the 98point6 care platform, the industry-leading AI-powered care delivery solution, which facilitates immediate access to high-quality, virtual care. Using our database of close to one million documented physician chats, which informs our proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs), paired with significant investments in building an AI team over the last year, Transcarent is set apart from others in the industry. Additionally, Transcarent uses custom testing, validation, and monitoring tools to enable responsible AI development and has built a proprietary multi-pronged safety system that acts as a common safety layer across all our AI products. Our membership in and work with the Data & Trust Alliance has also informed how to use AI safely and securely.\n\nWayFinding is the answer to the challenge of getting people the right information, when and where they need it. It also reduces the burden on human resources and benefits professionals, having to spend hours answering questions from confused employees. WayFinding will drive significant improvements in utilization and engagement.\n\n“WayFinding orients you. By pulling in every detail of an employer’s plan, any offered ancillary benefits, your medical history, and pairing that information with our team of top-rated virtual care clinical specialists, we can create a personalized understanding of each Member’s unique care needs, getting them exactly where they need to be every single time,” said Snezana Mahon, PharmD, Chief Operating Officer of Transcarent. “Your health and care should know you. With WayFinding, that’s now possible. This is the future of navigation and more.”\n\nTranscarent has a proven track record of delivering care experiences that Members value, returning to the experience time and again to meet their health and care needs. Of the Transcarent Members that activate, our 70 percent utilization and retention rates demonstrate that we are delivering on our mission of making it easy to access high-quality, affordable health and care.\n\nClick here to schedule a WayFinding demo.\n\nAbout Transcarent\n\nTranscarent is the One Place for Health and Care. We cut through complexity, making it easy for people to access high-quality, affordable health and care. We create a personalized experience tailored for each Member, including an on-demand care team, and a connected ecosystem of high-quality, in-person care and virtual point solutions.

      "# [Transcarent to acquire fellow health benefits navigator Accolade for $621M by Emily Olsen on 2025-01-09](https://www.hrdive.com/news/transcarent-acquire-accolade-621-million-health-benefits-navigation/736869/)\nDive Brief:\n\nTranscarent, a healthcare platform for self-insured employers, will acquire benefits navigator Accolade for about $621 million, the companies announced Wednesday.\n\nThe deal will combine Transcarent’s offerings — including an artificial intelligence-backed information and navigation service, health benefits guidance and virtual care — with Accolade’s services, like providing virtual primary care and specialist consultations, as well as patient advocates and care navigation.\n\nThe acquisition will net Accolade stockholders $7.03 per share in cash, an approximately 110% premium over the company’s closing stock price on Tuesday. Transcarent’s CEO, noted entrepreneur and investor Glen Tullman, will head up the combined organization, according to a spokesperson.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nFounded in 2020, Transcarent says it aims to provide a one-stop shop for workers navigating their benefits, looking for providers and accessing healthcare services. The company is a unicorn, most recently raising a $126 million Series D funding round in May last year that brought its total valuation to $2.2 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Accolade was founded nearly two decades ago and went public in 2020. The company offers a suite of navigation offerings, largely to employers, to assist employees with managing and understanding their benefits.\n\nThe combination of the two benefits technology companies, funded through financing from venture capital firm General Catalyst and Tullman’s 62 Ventures, will take Accolade private and create a single firm with more than 1,400 employer and payer clients, according to a press release.\n\nThe boards of both companies have already approved the acquisition, which is expected to close in the second quarter.\n\nThe deal would bring together both navigators’ services, including Transcarent’s WayFinding offering — a generative AI product launched last year where users could ask questions about which healthcare services are covered and how much they might cost, the companies said.\n\n“The two companies share a focus on embracing AI and advanced technology to change the way consumers experience the healthcare system,” Rajeev Singh, Accolade’s CEO, said in a statement.\n\nThe acquisition comes after Accolade reported a nearly $100 million net loss during its 2024 fiscal year ended last February, compared with a nearly $460 million loss in 2023. The company reported revenue of $414 million in fiscal 2024, an 18% increase from the prior year.\n\nThe benefits navigator is expected to release earnings for its third quarter of fiscal 2025 on Thursday. Accolade expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to be a loss between $3 million and $5 million and revenue between $104 million and $107 million.",

Transcarent is the one place for health and care,\" Glen Tullman, Transcarent CEO, said in a statement.\n\n\"One platform – your mobile phone – for everything you want and need. And an experience people don’t just like but love. High-quality care and cost reductions with a relentless focus on quality. Just what the doctor ordered.\"\n\nMARKET SNAPSHOT\n\nTranscarent emerged from stealth in March 2021, led by Livongo vet Glen Tullman.\n\nThe company announced it raised $200 million in Series C funding in 2022, and rolled out its pharmacy benefit offering the same year.\n\nTranscarent Pharmacy Care allows members to search for the lowest-cost drug option and compare prices across pharmacies. They can also transfer their prescription within Transcarent's app and access 24/7 support.\n\nLast year, the company announced plans to acquire assets from 98point6, including its AI-enabled virtual care platform and care business, in a deal worth up to $100 million.",
      "# [Over With Transcarent's $621M Acquisition by Marissa Plescia, Arundhati Parmar, www.facebook.com on 2025-01-09](https://medcitynews.com/2025/01/accolade-transcarent-acquisition/)\nA notable marriage is occurring in the world of digital health: Transcarent has claimed Accolade for $621 million. But by no means is this a marriage of equals given how the latter is being taken private after faltering in its aim to achieve profitability.\n\nDuring the pandemic, care navigation company Accolade’s stock was trading at nearly $60, a far cry from all of last year when the stock formally sank into the single digits. The Seattle company offers virtual primary care and mental health, as well as expert medical opinion, in addition to care navigation, and serves primarily self-insured employers.\n\nTranscarent, for its part, is known for its use of generative AI to simplify healthcare navigation by integrating benefits information, clinical guidance, and care delivery into a single platform — especially for people seeking surgery or oncology care. The San Francisco company has swooped in to purchase Accolade, taking advantage of its diminished stature. In 2022, Accolade lost its marquee customer, Comcast, which hit the company hard, believes Christina Farr, managing director at consulting firm Manatt Health.\n\nIn fact, Accolade’s stock has jumped 110% over its closing stock price on Tuesday, so investors are already seeing the merger as a winning move. But is that an indication of future success? After all, the transaction is being led by Transcarent’s CEO, Glen Tullman, who is perhaps best known for engineering a mega digital health deal back in August 2020, an $18.5 billion merger with Teladoc that everyone initially cheered. But since then, the combined company largely struggled to gain traction. In fact, in the first quarter of 2022, Teladoc took a whopping $6.6 billion charge to write down the value of its Livongo acquisition.\n\nSo will a similar fate befall the two companies that collectively serve 1,400 employer and payer clients? The short answer appears to be “no.”\n\nTullman wasn’t running Livongo after the acquisition, so “whatever happened post acquisition” can’t be “put at [Tullman’s] feet,” said Michael Greeley, cofounder and general partner of VC firm Flare Capital Partners, and a respected industry veteran.\n\nAnother industry follower echoed Greeley, explaining that the Teladoc-Livongo merger was actually a success if you were a Livongo shareholder. That deal, along with the Transcarent/Accolade deal, is another example of “Glen Tullman having the rarest strategic skill: the ability to identify when to buy or sell a healthcare asset,” said Seth Joseph, founder and managing director of healthcare consulting firm Summit Health Advisors.\n\nOther assets bought by Transcarent recently have been successful, said Alyssa Jaffee, partner at 7wireVentures, pointing to the company’spurchase of a part of 98point6. That has done “very well, with impressive client retention and great outcomes for members and clients,” Jaffee said.\n\nA similar infusion of new capital to turn around valuable but depressed assets is the story being repeated in the Accolade deal.\n\n“I think something like this, that kind of provides some capital and allows them to expand into some other areas that maybe have a different margin profile, that makes sense,” Farr said of Accolade’s prospects under Transcarent.\n\nShe noted that with Transcarent’s focus on AI through its WayFinding navigation product, it will be interesting to see if AI makes its way into Accolade’s capabilities after Transcarent takes the company private.\n\nAccolade’s interest in selling is likely an acknowledgement among Accolade’s investors that turning a business around in the public market is a challenging task.\n\n“I think it’s a quality asset, but once you’re trading at $1 or below $1 for a prolonged period of time, it’s really hard to come out of that,” Greeley said. “And it doesn’t mean that the assets are bad. It just is hard to do that in the public context.”\n\n[Greeley is technically wrong — Accolade’s stock never traded at $1 or below it but the spirit of his statement stands given before the transaction was announced, it was trading around $4 — in the penny stock category as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission]\n\nJoseph, the healthcare consultant, noted that while it’s not accurate to call this deal a fire sale for Accolade, it is a “sign of the times.” Accolade has tripled its revenue in four years and is sitting on more than $200 million of cash, but the company’s growth has “slowed to a crawl, they lack a clear plan to profitability, and operate in an increasingly competitive market,” he said.\n\nUltimately, the two companies are highly complementary, Jaffee noted.\n\n“Accolade is a leader in health advocacy, expert medical opinion, and primary care, which will now be combined with Transcarent’s AI-powered WayFinding capabilities and their care experiences (Surgery Care, Cancer Care, Weight Health) as well as pharmacy benefits. Employers and health plans are looking to simplify their benefits ecosystems and to ensure their employees and plan members actually use the services they are offering,” she said. “Today, that’s been lacking among point solutions, and clearly Transcarent believes creating a next generation platform is the answer.”\n\nEven a competitor of Accolade and Transcarent — navigation company Included Health — is applauding the deal.\n\n“We see Transcarent’s acquisition of Accolade as validation of the much needed personalized all-in-one healthcare approach, one that does not pivot from treating a person as a ‘patient’ for clinical needs to then treating a person as a ‘member’ for benefits’ needs; but rather, pulls together the power of clinical experts, modern technology and support to engage people across all clinical, financial, and administrative needs ongoing,” said Owen Tripp, CEO of Included Health.\n\nWhen asked what the name of the combined company will be, Transcarent told MedCity News that these details will be determined through the integration process. Tullman will be CEO of the new entity, while other leadership decisions, including the fate of Accolade CEO Rajeev Singh, will also be evaluated during the integration.\n\nTullman told MedCity News that his ultimate goal through the acquisition is to provide members with “one place to go for instant answers about their benefits, support for their health decisions, and on-demand access to care.” They will also receive “more personalized and integrated support across a wide range of health and care needs with the addition of Accolade’s capabilities,” he added.\n\nSingh echoed Tullman’s comments, saying in an email that by “bringing together Transcarent’s generative AI-powered WayFinding and comprehensive care experiences with Accolade’s advocacy, expert medical opinions, and primary care, we are delivering one place for health and care.”\n\nUltimately, the deal, which is expected to close in the second calendar quarter of 2025, is truly an indication of what didn’t occur as much as it was predicted in 2024 but may well take place this year — the continued consolidation of point solutions in the world of digital health.\n\nPhoto: designer491, Getty Images",

      "# [Expert Tips For High Availability Through Workload Orchestration by Expert Panel® on 2024-12-02](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/12/02/expert-tips-for-high-availability-through-workload-orchestration/)\nMaintaining a seamless, uninterrupted user experience is central to effective workload orchestration. With today’s tech environments spanning on-premises and cloud networks, diverse teams, and connected devices, flexible and well-considered strategies are essential.\n\nIt’s a complex challenge, and expert advice can be invaluable. Below, members of Forbes Technology Council share their experience and advice for developing an effective workload orchestration system. Tap into their expertise to help your team deliver reliable, optimized services and an excellent user experience.\n\n1. Integrate Multicloud Platforms With Automated Failover\n\nBy integrating multicloud platforms with automated failover mechanisms, workloads can dynamically shift from one cloud provider to another in the event of an outage, ensuring minimal downtime. This also allows for the application of load balancing techniques that dynamically distribute traffic across multiple regions, ensuring optimal performance while preventing overload on any single node. - Bhaskar Gangipamula, Quadrant Technologies\n\n2. Combine Workload Distribution With Monitoring And Recovery\n\nThe strategy should include two parts. First, have workloads distributed across multiple availability zones to ensure high availability. Second, have monitoring and recovery systems in place that include prompt alerts, self-healing capabilities and regular backups. - Ravi Laudya, SAP Concur\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify?\n\n3. Leverage Container Orchestration\n\nA strategy for high availability and fault tolerance is to use container orchestration tools like Kubernetes. These tools split your app into smaller containers distributed across multiple servers. If one server fails, Kubernetes automatically shifts the workload to the other, healthy containers, ensuring minimal downtime and uninterrupted service—like a backup system that keeps everything running smoothly. - KJ Dhaliwal, Lotus Health AI\n\n4. Set Up Autonomous AI Agents\n\nAutonomous AI agents provide real value by analyzing patterns in system logs, performance metrics and error rates. They can proactively detect issues before they result in downtime. By identifying anomalies and predicting potential failures, these agents can trigger preventive actions, such as scaling resources, rerouting traffic or spinning up services, to ensure high availability. - Manjula Iyer, 98point6 Technologies\n\n5. Consider This Three-Step Approach\n\nHaving built a high-availability and fault-tolerant VoIP soft switch, we took three major steps. First, we deployed across multiple cloud providers to eliminate outages caused by underlying data center failures. Second, end-user devices were registered to different nodes, preventing the entire site from experiencing issues. Lastly, we utilized active-active environments that are always in sync, allowing us to reprioritize traffic in real time. - Hamed Mazrouei, Milagro\n\n6. Validate Your Availability And Fault Tolerance In Noncrisis Situations\n\nThere is no substitute for validating your high availability and fault tolerance strategy on a regular basis in noncrisis situations. Make needed adjustments during these validation periods to improve the durability of your solution. A best practice would be to spend the appropriate amount of time up front designing the strategy and then validating it with current operations to make updates as required. - Russ Kennedy, Nasuni\n\n7. Use A Hybrid Setup\n\nAn effective strategy is using a multicloud or hybrid setup. This spreads workloads across different cloud providers, reducing the risk of downtime. Combine this with auto-scaling and load balancing, which adjust resources based on demand, and use automation to detect and fix issues early, keeping systems running smoothly without manual intervention. - Ehsan Ahmadi, Vox Solutions\n\n8. Leverage A Microservices-Based Architecture\n\nA microservices-based architecture helps prevent single points of failure by distributing functionality. Design services to be idempotent and stateless, decoupling state to enhance resilience and scalability. Utilize self-healing orchestration tools like Kubernetes, and adopt active-active configurations for data and state management to ensure continuous availability and robust fault tolerance. - Koushik Sundar, Citibank\n\n9. Build A Decoupled System\n\nYou can achieve high availability and fault tolerance in many ways, but at what cost? Tools like Kubernetes and load balancers can help. But to effectively achieve high availability and fault tolerance, you should build a decoupled system so that different components are isolated and have only the necessary dependencies between them. This will allow you to orchestrate the workload only for those components that require it. - Oleg Lola, MobiDev\n\n10. Focus On Optimization\n\nOne strategy for ensuring high availability and fault tolerance through effective workload orchestration is to focus on optimization. Not every node needs the same amount of processing power; it’s important to have load balance functionality and do stress testing to stay ahead of the game. - Syed Ahmed, Act-On Software\n\n11. Follow The Principle That ‘Everything Fails, All The Time’\n\nThis may be a bit more philosophical, but when designing any critical system, I follow this principle: “Everything fails, all the time.” This mindset drives designs that eliminate single points of failure, favor distributed systems with “shared nothing” architecture, and incorporate queuing mechanisms. Though it’s often overlooked, non-software resilience—like multiregion deployments and robust network configurations—is also important, even in the cloud. - Elliott Cordo, Data Futures\n\n12. Use Containerization And Automated Scaling\n\nOne effective way to keep things running smoothly is to use containerization and automated scaling. This allows you to isolate applications, which makes them consistent across environments. Orchestrators help by automatically managing these containers and distributing workloads evenly while monitoring for failures. When an issue is detected, the orchestrator can adjust with little to no downtime. - Thomas Griffin, OptinMonster\n\n13. Implement Messaging Queues And Asynchronous Processing Patterns\n\nBased on our experience building healthcare apps, implementing message queues and asynchronous processing patterns is essential. By decoupling services and using tools like RabbitMQ, we create buffer zones that prevent system overload. If one component slows down, messages stay in the queue until processing capacity recovers. - Marc Fischer, Dogtown Media LLC\n\n14. Utilize Active-Passive Failover Architectures\n\nUtilize active-passive failover architectures by designing your system with an active instance and a passive standby. The passive instance takes over in the event of a failure, ensuring minimal downtime. - Manasi Sharma, Microsoft\n\n15. Ensure Multiple Redundancies\n\nUse redundant hardware, software and network components. Implement load balancing to evenly distribute workloads and clustering to allow multiple servers to operate as a single system, improving performance. Utilize database replication to ensure data accessibility across locations, even during failures. Together, these strategies ensure high availability and fault tolerance, creating a resilient infrastructure. - Brian Sathianathan, Iterate.ai\n\n16. Use Service Mesh Architecture With Open-Source Tools\n\nOne overlooked strategy I would like to highlight is using service mesh architecture with open-source tools like Istio or Linkerd. By abstracting network traffic management between services, you gain fine-grained control over load balancing, retries and automatic failovers. This approach will ensure high availability and fault tolerance without adding complexity to the application code. - Santhosh Vijayabaskar\n\n17. Implement ‘Degraded Mode’ Capabilities\n\nImplement “degraded mode” capabilities across all critical services. Instead of binary up-down states, design systems to gracefully reduce functionality when under stress. For example, disable real-time updates while keeping core transactions running, or serve cached data instead of live queries. This ensures business continuity even during partial failures. - Chandra Kuchi, Robinhood\n\n18. Take A Proactive Approach",

      "# [Health and Safety on 2024-09-05](https://allegheny.edu/academics/global-education/health-and-safety/)\nHealth Concerns\n\nInsurance and Study Abroad\n\nAllegheny purchases a global emergency and medical assistance insurance policy for every study abroad student. This plan offers Medical Assistance Services, Medical Evacuation & Repatriation Services, Security & Natural Disaster Evacuation Services, Worldwide Destination Intelligence, and Personal Travel Assistance Services. See full coverage details on the summary of benefits. Students will receive their individual insurance cards prior to departure. Note that this policy does not carry any coverage in the United States and is only in effect between the official start and end dates of the student’s program abroad.\n\nStudents must also retain their existing US-based health insurance: study abroad insurance does NOT replace comprehensive, US-­based health insurance as required by Allegheny college. You may not participate in an Allegheny study abroad program without certifying that you have US-based coverage or are purchasing the Allegheny College student health plan.\n\nRead more about our global emergency and medical assistance coverage.\n\nDomestic travelers\n\nStudy away travelers within the U.S.A. are not part of the above mentioned plan. Domestic travelers must maintain their regular US-based insurance policy and should ensure they are aware of their coverage and claim process when traveling outside of Meadville.\n\nHealth Precautions\n\nRemaining healthy while studying abroad in an unfamiliar environment is always a challenge. The majority of study away students will experience some sort of health problem during their time abroad, most likely digestive troubles, dehydration, exhaustion, stress, and anxiety as they adjust to their host culture.\n\nFor any student going away, to any location, you need to make an appointment with your doctor at least 6 weeks prior to departure. This is a good time for your annual check-up to ensure you have no new health concerns. During the appointment make sure to talk about any current and on-going health conditions and how studying abroad might impact your health.\n\nTraveling with Prescription Medicine\n\nIf you are currently taking prescription or over the counter medications, you will need to make sure that you have access to these medications while you are abroad.\n\nTalk to your physician about getting a supply of your prescription medication to last the entire time that you are abroad. However, be aware that many countries will only allow quantities of medication for personal use.\n\nResearch the laws and regulations of the country to make sure that your prescription and over-the-counter medications are permissible and available. Be aware that in many countries amphetamine-based medications used for attention deficit disorders are illegal or highly restricted.\n\nPack your prescription medications, in original containers, in your carry-on luggage. Do not pack the medications in your checked luggage.\n\nHave a letter on letterhead from the prescribing physician for all prescribed medications (including their generic names), indicating your diagnosis, treatment, and medication regimen. This is extremely important in case you need treatment or a medication refill abroad.\n\nDo not plan on sending medications abroad.\n\nDon’t stop taking your medications or adjust your dosage unless advised to do so by a medical professional. Students may have feelings of excitement and exhilaration when they arrive abroad and sometimes decide to stop taking their medication. Don’t do this.\n\nIf you need a refill while abroad, you must see a local doctor to get a similar prescription. It will be critical to have a letter on letterhead from the prescribing physician for all prescribed medications (including their generic names), indicating your diagnosis, treatment, and medication regimen.\n\nAccessibility\n\nStudents who receive accommodations for medical issues on campus should discuss this with the Global Education Office along with other concerns about studying away. They should also consult with the Student Accessibility and Support Services Office to plan for their time off-campus. Many study away programs are able to provide similar or modified accommodations. In order for this to happen, students must complete the Study Away Accessibility & Accommodations Request Form during the pre-departure process. This form is confidential and will only be used by staff in Global Education, Student Accessibility and Support Services, and on-site staff involved in requesting accessibility accommodations for your study away program. Laws are different in other countries around the world and not all accommodations provided on campus are available in all places.\n\nMental Health Support While Away\n\nStudents in need of immediate mental health support should contact 911 or local emergency services.\n\nVirtual mental wellness support is also available for DOMESTIC study away students who remain in the USA during their studies through CampusCare / 98point6. This service offers 24/7 virtual primary healthcare (by text and/or video-based access to licensed and board-certified U.S. physicians in all 50 states, including Pennsylvania). The program also give access through the primary physician to appointment-based behavioral telehealth with counseling services. To access services, download the 98point6 iOS app or Android app, confirm your cell phone number, and complete your profile.\n\nNOTE: These services are not available to students who are not located in the USA due to legalities. Study abroad students located outside the USA can contact the 24/7 Line above or contact their on-site staff for referrals to on-site, English-speaking mental health and wellness counseling.",
