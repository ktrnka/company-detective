      "# [98point6 Technologies on 2024-03-08](https://www.98point6.com/platform/)\nAsynchronous care, or “async,” is a type of virtual care with no scheduling requirements, giving the patient the flexibility and convenience to seek care for non-urgent concerns whenever and wherever they’d like. Whereas a response from a provider may occur quickly, there is no real-time interaction between the patient and the medical staff. This type of dedicated care also helps with capturing revenue by incorporating patient messages from a provider’s inbox back into the patient chart to enhance the continuity of care. 98point6 can support your clinicians in asynchronously diagnosing and treating more than 140 common conditions for patients across all ages—from pediatrics to geriatrics.\n\nOur AI-powered solution leverages evidence-based clinical content, machine learning, and automation to recommend the optimal care option, while also giving patients the ability to choose the format they prefer. Customizable to the specific workflow of the healthcare organization, the clinician can direct the patient to real-time care or prompt them to seek in-person care if their medical concern cannot be treated asynchronously.\n\nReal-time virtual care can consist of text-based messaging, audio, or video interactions, or any combination of the three. Additionally, real-time care can be facilitated as an on-demand or scheduled visit. On-demand visits allow patients to immediately start a visit, any time, from anywhere. Patients can report symptoms and concerns and our product gathers relevant history, before connecting the patient to a clinician. Wait times in the queue are dependent on clinician availability. Scheduled visits allow patients to choose a date and time in the future that is most convenient for them.\n\nOur patient intake automates much of the administrative tasks associated with taking a history. Our product is trained, based on millions of patient encounters, to respond to patient-reported symptoms with question sets, written by physicians, that elicit relevant clinical details for provider review. It works like this: the patient enters their chief complaint as free text. They can write as much or as little as they want to communicate the reason for their visit and their symptoms. The 98point6 platform intakes all of that information and then generates the appropriate follow-up questions.\n\nOur patient intake process significantly reduces the administrative burden on clinicians – and automatically captures an accurate transcript of patient-reported symptoms.\n\nWe have been applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to medical encounters since 2015. As a result, we have a vast data set that is one-of-a-kind in the field of natural language processing for medical applications. We utilize Al and machine learning to improve both efficiency and medical quality by automating time-consuming tasks, allowing clinicians to focus their judgment on key decision points in the clinical encounter. Our system provides information and actions for the clinician to consider; however, the clinician is in complete control of the visit diagnosis, and care planning.\n\nData integration is cornerstone to the 98point6 platform. EMR data can be automatically pulled into the clinician console, and once the visit is complete, data is automatically sent to the EMR to be recorded in the patient’s medical record. Our standards-based integration supports Epic and Cerner, as well as other EMRs. The platform also supports data integrations for analytics, reporting, security and compliance and other administrative needs.",

As part of the deal, hundreds of 98point6 enterprise customers including Boeing, Kindercare and Banner|Aetna employing millions of eligible members will have access to an even wider selection of primary and behavioral health services through Transcarent. The newly emerged 98point6 Technologies plans to remain solely focused on licensing its software to third-party health care providers such as MultiCare Health System, the first to license the 98point6 Technology Platform within its hybrid ambulatory care platform, Indigo Health.\n\n“Our evolution to 98point6 Technologies answers the need for purpose-built technology created by physicians, for physicians, and is the culmination of work our front-line team of clinicians spent years perfecting,” said Jay Burrell, President and Chief Executive Officer of 98point6 Technologies. “This comes at a time when every provider in the health services industry is on an urgent mission to remain competitive in what has become an increasingly crowded and undifferentiated marketplace.”\n\nIn today’s market, demand for telehealth services has stabilized at 38 times higher than pre-pandemic levels and healthcare providers are scrambling to catch up, citing telehealth implementation as a top challenge. According to new research only 13% of hospitals and health systems consider themselves ahead of the pace of change that patients expect and new market rivals are setting, and only 11% of health systems report being in the implementation phase of their personalized care and digital transformation journeys.\n\nHealth systems recognize they must move quickly to solidify their brand presence and physical footprint, starting with the expansion of their ambulatory care business and introduction of new technology and consumer-centered services. Gartner’s Hype Cycle for Healthcare Providers, 2022 corroborated the shift, stating “we see greater provider interest and focus on virtual care and total experience to meet clinical and business demands.”\n\nTechnology Built to Give Health Care Providers a Competitive Edge\n\nThe 98point6 Technology Platform provides a turn-key, cloud-based solution for scaling up a virtual care operation complete with software, professional services and support from a team who built and operated a successful, nationwide virtual clinic for the past several years. The platform provides a quick and cost effective way to create new revenue opportunities, better support the workforce, improve care and boost the bottom line. Implementation includes a client-branded app and assistance in configuring the platform.\n\n“Our strategic partnership with 98point6 will help us scale our digital capabilities to meet community demand and bring a new level of meaningful engagement to our customers,” said Ryan Fix, President of Retail Health at MultiCare.\n\nAt the heart of the 98point6 Technology Platform is a web-based Clinician Console, which encapsulates a refined set of best practices designed to help providers deliver high quality virtual care based on years of clinical experience. Built-in logic in the form of artificial intelligence (AI) and automated practice standards guide providers to quickly make the right medical decisions or recommend in-person care when needed. This level of automation limits care variability, optimizes patient time by streamlining the intake process and reduces cognitive load on the provider to support top-of-licensure practice.\n\nThe 98point6 Technology Platform includes:\n\nA standalone digital clinic hosted in the cloud, including AI-powered patient engagement, workflow and EHR integration, care follow-up and documentation.\n\nWeb-based Clinician Console for providers to conduct visits.\n\nAn SDK to create a fully-branded patient experience.\n\nTraining and development for clinicians and staff.\n\nEngagement marketing support to activate new users and drive utilization.\n\nWorkforce management guidance to help define hybrid staffing and scheduling plans.\n\nFor more information on 98point6 Technologies, visit 98point6.com.\n\nAbout 98point6 Technologies\n\n98point6 Technologies builds and licenses software to power exceptional virtual care experiences for providers and patients based on years of clinical use across millions of patients.

As a provider responsible for handling calls from subscribed employees, it is crucial that her professionalism and respect reflect the value of the service that employers pay for. The purpose of this service is to provide employees with prompt and convenient care, and it is essential that her behavior aligns with this objective.\n\nUnfortunately, my experience with Nurse  was far from satisfactory. After expressing a differing opinion, she abruptly terminated the visit, displaying a lack of professionalism and cowardice.

I used the app for the first time today, answered the pre-“visit” questions (not bad there), and then when my virtual doctor joined, it was more or less the doctor messaging the entire time, not letting me really get a word in, and trying to push things on me without me getting to tell him what I was looking for as an end result. I told the doctor my issue and asked if it were possible for a script (nothing with painkillers or anything they aren’t allowed to prescribe), to which the doctor essentially ignored me and recommended things I have been doing to no avail throughout being sick. I informed the doctor that his advice was not something that was working, however I would give one of his solutions a try (it was clear he had no interest in helping me, as my primary care would have) and wrapped up the conversation asap. Again, I like the concept of this app; I think it’s a great idea…just not so much the staff that partners with the app. It all felt impersonal and like a quick cash grab.",

Also, from my experience the physicians are not well qualified and don’t take your symptoms into consideration whatsoever. For example: I have had a sore throat for almost 2 weeks now and can never get to the doctors office because they work the same hours I do… I told the doctor my symptoms and told him that I have been taking antihistamines and nasal spray that have been working but my throat is still killing me; he proceeded to prescribe me the same antihistamines and nasal spray that I had already been taking none of which would help my throat whatsoever… It also takes a good 30-45 minutes to finish your appointment because it’s ALL texting.

Unfortunately, I have been experiencing symptoms that lead me to suspect I may have contracted strep throat, although I cannot be entirely certain. In an attempt to seek medical advice conveniently, I decided to utilize the 98.6 app, a service provided by our employer. Previously, we had been using Teldoc for the past 20 years, but our employer recently switched to 98.6, which has proven to be an inconvenience and a waste of time, with no added convenience.\n\nDuring my recent interaction with the 98.6 app, I had the opportunity to consult with the FNP-BC, a Nurse Practitioner based in New York, NY. As a provider responsible for handling calls from subscribed employees, it is crucial that her professionalism and respect reflect the value of the service that employers pay for. The purpose of this service is to provide employees with prompt and convenient care, and it is essential that her behavior aligns with this objective.\n\nUnfortunately, my experience with Nurse  was far from satisfactory. After expressing a differing opinion, she abruptly terminated the visit, displaying a lack of professionalism and cowardice.

I told the doctor my issue and asked if it were possible for a script (nothing with painkillers or anything they aren’t allowed to prescribe), to which the doctor essentially ignored me and recommended things I have been doing to no avail throughout being sick. I informed the doctor that his advice was not something that was working, however I would give one of his solutions a try (it was clear he had no interest in helping me, as my primary care would have) and wrapped up the conversation asap.

Also, from my experience the physicians are not well qualified and don’t take your symptoms into consideration whatsoever. For example: I have had a sore throat for almost 2 weeks now and can never get to the doctors office because they work the same hours I do… I told the doctor my symptoms and told him that I have been taking antihistamines and nasal spray that have been working but my throat is still killing me; he proceeded to prescribe me the same antihistamines and nasal spray that I had already been taking none of which would help my throat whatsoever… It also takes a good 30-45 minutes to finish your appointment because it’s ALL texting.

      "# Post ID bg7ip2: Internet medicine is awesome, 98point6 was so so helpful for me with +55 score by [(FrugalChef13, Reddit, 2019-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/)\n**TL;DR- $20 got me an awesome appointment with a nice doctor and a prescription for a medication I could afford that solved my issue.**\n\n*Disclaimer: This particular thing worked well for me so I'm going to tell you about it. Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I'm not compensated or connected to the website I'm discussing.*\n\nSo like a lot of people on here I'm usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it's underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I've got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I'd run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn't been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn't, it's weird.\n\nSo I was fucked.  Can't sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can't afford the $100+ for a doctor's appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there's a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\n\nSo I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It's $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I'm drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I'm still in bad shape tomorrow morning it's worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\n\nGuys, it was amazing.  It's not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I'd already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn't help.  She was so kind, and didn't make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor's appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it's faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can't prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I'd taken in the past wasn't an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What's the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\n\nUsually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it's what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you'll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can't estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\n\nThis amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I'll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn't shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that's a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\n\nI would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It's not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it's a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\n\nIf anyone else has recommendations or critiques or thoughts on internet medicine stuff I'd love to hear it.\n\n## Comment ID elj1h0o with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/elj1h0o/) (in reply to ID bg7ip2):\nThat sounds like a great resource!

Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.\n\nA prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\n\nControlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\n\nSo the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.  Neither medication can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor, but Vicodin is super extra hard to get prescribed.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nEDIT: I tried to clarify the original post to make it more obvious that although she couldn't prescribe the thing I'd taken in the past, she did prescribe a thing that helped a lot.  It actually helped even more than the thing I'd taken in the past and without making me drowsy, which is AWESOME!\n\n#### Comment ID elkh6df with +3 score by [(Mr_Fuzzo, Reddit, 2019-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/elkh6df/) (in reply to ID eljx9uw):\nControlled substances, for the un-initiated are medications like opiates, barbiturates, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, etc.\n\nSo, meds like Xanax, OxyContin, Ritalin, etc.\n\n#### Comment ID eljy54o with +2 score by [(AnotherDay_RS, Reddit, 2019-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/eljy54o/) (in reply to ID eljx9uw):\nThat's great!!

A friendly return desk person told me that I could simply buy a new item on discount, then return it immediately and they would refund the higher price - effectively letting me buy the item at a discount.\n\n### Comment ID i5g6z6p with +27 score by [(mynameroro, Reddit, 2022-04-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/u7mkpr/most_underrated_costco_benefit/i5g6z6p/) (in reply to ID i5fsgxj):\nThis also works if you KNOW something is going to go on sale in the next 30 days but also likely to sell out quickly.

They will try to fill it for me once if they can get in touch with the person who prescribed in to me, but idk if that's actually going to happen. I might try to transfer my prescription elsewhere but the only other pharmacy anywhere near me is a CVS and from what I've seen, they also don't fill many telehealth prescriptions for controlled substances. \n\nAnd yeah, I understand caution with controlled substances, but it's really weird to me that if any other certified provider had prescribed this, it would have been fine, but because it was a certified provider online it's not ok???

Words can’t describe how much I hate that stupid company. I’d recommend calling your primary care provider and explaining the situation. Most of the time they can write it as long as you can show a diagnosis and proof you’ve taken it before. \n\nThat’ll also protect you from losing your prescription when the pandemic exemption eventually expires— it’s a general rule for controlled substances that you need at least one in-person meeting with the doctor before they can fill it. I think some places don’t require this, but AFAIK it was a requirement pre-2020. I know they did also always require the person who prescribed it to be in-state back then as well. \n\nAt least they stopped requiring you to physically deliver HANDWRITTEN prescriptions.

I love the simplicity and often lower cost of telehealth, but I honestly wonder if they ever decline to give out a prescription. If you want Adderall, you just pay the online provider and get a script. There are even telehealth services for testosterone replacement therapy prescribing 200mg of testosterone to 19 year old kids who basically want legal anabolic steroids. I've seen guys with testosterone levels of 800pg/dL getting TRT scripts for quadruple the normal dosage. While some providers may be acting responsibly, there are countless services that are not.\n\nAdderall works great for a lot of people, there are plenty of people that depend on it. It is also a dangerous stimulant that is wickedly over-prescribed. I can understand the pharmacy having hesitations about this. In the not-so-distant past, it was opioids being handed out like candy.

My state requires a physical paper prescription be presented every time, no refills, no digital, no call-ins. My psych writes them 3 months at a time and post-dates them with “do not fill before m/d/yy” on each one. Took me a year to learn that the pharmacy I use for my Cotempla will take them all at once if they’re post-dated.

Basically pill mills started up, and doctors at them would write scripts for millions of pills for \"patients\" all over the country that they could never have possibly seen. So as a response Walgreens (and CVS, I believe), the two largest pharmacy chains in the US, have instituted a policy that if you are presenting a new script, the prescriber is not local, and you've not been on the medication before, the pharmacist can, and usually will require that they speak to the doctor to confirm the script, dosage, and DX before dispensing the drug. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get telehealth can be a good thing, but for psychoactive medication that can be abused like stimulants, I think what Walgreens and CVS are doing is a reasonable control mechanism on  MDs/DOs/PAs/APNs just writing scripts like crazy.\n\n#### Comment ID isvvl0w with +7 score by [(Tragically_Fantastic, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/isvvl0w/) (in reply to ID isve0mi):\nI do think it's an ok policy, but basically what this pharmacist said was if they can get in touch with my prescriber, they'll fill it one time, but after that they won't do it again, which feels kinda backwards to me?

I was told yes, and they would be filled by the time I got there in half an hour. I get there, with my daughter who is having problems breathing and needs meds to help clear out her bronchial tubes, the meds arent filled. They will be ready in another half an hour I am told. So I wait. I come back to pick them up and they tell me, \"oops they are out of stock.\" I was livid. \n\nThe time before that they suggested I drive 2 hours away to a store to get an out of stock med. Terrible pharmacy. Ill never go to a walgreens again. Ive gone to meijer for almost a decade now. Best decision I ever made. They are cheaper, they dont give me shit about my ADHD scripts, and are always kind and respectful to me.\n\n## Comment ID isxgkh4 with +3 score by [(Ohthatcal, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/isxgkh4/) (in reply to ID y7elk6):\nActually, the DEA said that pharmacies aren’t allowed to fill scripts for controlled medications that were prescribed from telehealth doctors. \n\nDuring covid they relaxed the regulations around telehealth but that led to places like Cerebral over diagnosing and is one of the reasons that ADHD medication right now is on back order everywhere.

I have not had one ounce of ill will or trouble from anyone at Mayo, and I can just go to their pharmacy and get my Rx filled. The worst part is waiting between appointments... The journey from initial consult to CBT appointments and then confirmation with a psych eval and prescribing meds took about a year, not because they were unsure, but because the calendars were (and remain) pretty well booked up. Side note: I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder (recurrent), and that's why I had CBT appointments mixed in there. They had to rule out anxiety before ADHD, but the doc smartly suggested the ADHD was leading to my anxiety, so he is treating the ADHD first. Side side note, for anyone who has had problems with Mayo, I'm sorry you went through that, and this is just my own personal experience.\n\n## Comment ID isxwa5n with +3 score by [(Ryan7032, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/isxwa5n/) (in reply to ID y7elk6):\nGood faith policy?\n\n## Comment ID isyafr6 with +3 score by [(fairybabybug, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/isyafr6/) (in reply to ID y7elk6):\nI don’t take Adderall, but I take another ADHD medication and it took me SOOOOOOO long to get that sucker filled!

I promise we aren’t trying to make life miserable for you. I have adhd too. We have a duty to fill a prescription “in good faith” - I can lose my license otherwise. Example: There are 2 providers from telehealth that I see hundreds and hundreds of Adderall rx from - from their FL, CO, and CA office. I do not see them prescribe *anything* except Adderall. At all. That is a massive red flag for me. They have also (confirmed) never met with any of their patients in person. Another red flag. \n\nI can also understand that seeing a doctor in person is difficult for some people and their schedules- I have to schedule an appt once every 3 months in person myself and it is very difficult with my unpredictable schedule. Bottom line is our license and livelihood is on the line. I think of telehealth as a non-permanent solution while establishing a provider in your community.\n\nLastly, with so many rx now coming from telehealth we are hitting our max of many stimulants that we can order from the DEA on a monthly basis. I cannot take care of our current clientele with the massive influx - we already hit our DEA limit as it is. I usually suggest folks try another pharmacy in a more suburban area (we are urban and Adderall-sense) so you don’t have to go weeks without your medication. \n\nAlso as some others have mentioned, C2s cannot be transferred so you will need to have your prescriber send in a new rx to the pharmacy at which you want to have it filled. \n\nWe’re also extremely understaffed which complicates everything. Please be nice to us. It is hell on earth at most pharmacies right now. \n\n**I would suggest doing mail order pharmacy to get your med (Amazon has a pharmacy) or any independent pharmacy in your area.** I hope this helps clarify some misunderstandings.\n\n### Comment ID isyt1l9 with +2 score by [(Tragically_Fantastic, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/isyt1l9/) (in reply to ID isyqlmt):\nYeah, I understand that.

It used to be sooo easy with my psychiatrist. Dr. Awesome would prescribe my meds for 90 days. So I would call her once every 3 months and l would... get this... only have to leave her a message. All her phone calls went directly to voice mail. And if I left her with my name, meds refilled and phone number to reach me I would get a notification 1 hour later that she sent my script in. I would see her in person every six months as a general check up. So fucking easy. \n\nBut she retired... now i go to my practioner because I'm fucking stable! (Honestly super proud of that accomplishment) however, this new doctor can't prescribe them for 90 days only 30. So every month I have to remember to call their office. Explain to the person on the phone what I need. That yes I have two meds with the same name. I've been through this routine so many times I can pronounce dexemethlyfenidate. She passes it along to the doctor. Doctor approves it and after two days if the pharmacy doesn't call me I have to call them to make sure it got pushed through. Wait another day. Now it takes them a week or so to figure out billing me. By the time they do bill me I forget about it and it ends up getting close to being over due. I pay the bill. And now its time to  start the whole refill process over again.

I wonder if its a blessing in disguise for some people. Guys if you are going through this, do not let it stress you. This is what I did, now be prepared because it is going to sound cheesy because I am a very cheesy person... When Walgreens made me wait 3 weeks for my newly prescribed telehealth Adderall 10mgs during the last few weeks of school (including finals), it made me feel like... worse than poop. I will admit when I got the RX, I had the most surreal sense of calm and peace. Like finally my war was over and I could be treated like a normal person. I didn't have to seek illegal alternatives anymore and feel like a criminal. I could finally get help for my issues and my life was about to improve dramatically. Then doubt crept in, I am not worth this RX, I am not worth getting better, I am a criminal, I am a bad person. I do not deserve to be high functioning like my friends and family. I deserve to live the life I am living. (Obviously have self-esteem issues) With all this thinking floating around in my head, I called Walgreens to see if they ahd received my medication, and this started the whole awkward \"Oh, the medication is on back-order and we do not know when it will be in.\" If a pharmacy wants to fill your RX, the alternative to this wil be \"Oh, your medication is not in stock but go ahead and get your RX sent in so we can get it in stock ASAP.\" There is no such thing as just telling a patient who has been prescribed a medication by a licensed physician that their medication is just not available with no explanation. I did not know this though. It took me weeks to learn this. I thought the medication was really out of stock! It took calling other pharmacies and hearing the condescending tone in their nvoice that made me realize this was a catch all resposne to telehealth prescriptions. They even started denying the other script that I had been getting for over 5 years through telehealth! (Suboxone - huge deal to be cut off).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was so down in the dumps. Then I was taught a new method of thinking by a person I look up to. I started ending all the negative shit. I started saying positive stuff to myself to build myself up... \"You are a pre-med student and will get any treatment you need for any illness you are diagnosed with.\" I looked on reddit for pharmacies that other students of UCF were using and not having trouble getting their rX'S filled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI basically changed up my thinking and if I got a negative response from a pharmacy (I did, a few times...) I simply acted confused (Because deep down I was anyways)... If someone treats you in a way you know for a fact you do not deserve, do not get upset back at them, do not get upset period... It is okay to show confusion, which is justified. Acting confused changed up the dynamics so much that a few pharmacy techs even explained to me what was actually going on, Walgreens had decided to implement a policy where the prescribing doctor had to be within a 30 mile radius of the patient and had seen the patient in the last year. Other pharmacies were following their lead. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a good person. I do however have ADHD. I deserve treatment. I deserve to be treated with respect. Trust me, okay, there is a way to get your RX filled. It may not be through Walgreens, but there is a way if you keep up your spirits and be true to what you deserve. Do not use this as an excuse to get frustrated and head back to the streets for illegal adderall. Fight for your own prescription!!!!  \n\n\nI ended up getting mine filled at a Costco, a pharamcy which has been deemed to be problematic for telehealth prescriptions. However I did not have one single problem with them and they treated me like a decent human being. Yes its 1 hour from my house, but I will gladly pass all the pharmacies that literally are 100% fine with prescribing 1,000,000s of lethal Oxycontin pills but not 1 helpful stimulant or OUD MAT therapy.\n\n## Comment ID j6dvo6h with +1 score by [(PenaltyParticular909, Reddit, 2023-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/j6dvo6h/) (in reply to ID y7elk6):\nThat's why I stopped going to Big box pharmacies because they're always looking at you sideways like they don't drink their bottles of wine as soon as they get home.

Unthankfully ADMIN is closed as well and  I am sick have been for several days and it is very likely the transformer variant Omicron. I don't know yet because I was to busy trying to remain alive barely able to move except to sip water or gatorade while looking at the ever increasing temperature reading on my thermometer 104.1 is my record so far? Go me? Currently its at 100.9 so much better than it was before.\n\nBut ya since the dirty little secret of holiday day entails that you don't get the pay if you don't work the previous and next shifts between that day. I didn't want to call out I really didn't want to I knew probably by about 7 tonight that there was no way I was going to be able to go in.\n\nWe have to give notice an hour before our shift right? Normally that would be fine just one problem. I open. This morning in 4 hours. I looked up the unum number and called it but an automated message told me UNUM hours and disconnected the call. So clearly not the number I have called before.\n\nI haven't got a test because I can't find a pharmacy nearby that stocked any my mom ordered one offline that said it would get there on friday (when she was ordering it for herself) then it said sunday and now it says TBD)\n\nI seriously considered just calling out ahead of time on Friday Night but figured what kind of lunatic calls out sick over a day before their shift. Now that the temperature isn't as high and hallucinations have faded from the frying of my brain I realize the lunatic is the one who DOESNT call out a day before knowing full well you won't be better a day after having a 104 degree fever.\n\nBut like protocols and all that right. I am pretty damn sure I have it but I have not officially been tested as such have no documented proof to give other than 5 of the 17 people at family christmas party have it. Ive been vaccinated J&J but not boostered (had planned to eventually should have acted sooner) I don't even care about the covid pay my brain and muscles hurt to much for me to care about anything but this hell ending. But I do care about accountability and not being marked as a no call no show because I didn't give an hours notice. When I can't because if I work at 4am and managers enter the building at 345 am wtf am I supposed to do?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. If anyone has the unum number that redirects to the afterhours thing or the teledoc I would appreciate it. If it matters I work in SE in GA\n\n## Comment ID hqwjxln with +16 score by [(cursesonyourmom, Reddit, 2022-01-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/ru2atc/costco_employee_trying_to_call_out_sick_but_cant/hqwjxln/) (in reply to ID ru2atc):\nPer the 2019 employee agreement\n\n4.

If you're not spending much each year, it's your best option. If you're worried about catastrophic scenarios, the HSA does have a maximum out-of-pocket of $6,500, so you won't have to pay more than that in any given year. The only reason you might look at the other plans is if you fall somewhere in between.\n\nAs for your concern about \"too good to be true\", the reality is that for the company, it's still the cheapest option even with the annual HSA contribution since few will hit that maximum unless there is a catastrophic health event.

Just make sure u fill out a medical LOA for the date you left, make sure its under continuous leave and fill out the form. As long as you have an ACTIVE medical LOA case open, amazon has to give you 30 days for you to submit appropriate documents supporting ur case :) so even if ur negative u cant get terminated. How do i know this bc last tuesday i left work to care after my partner bc shes pregnant with my child and she has bad asthma. I was negative -6.43 and was told by hr they are sorry and hope all gets better but if i didnt make a DLS case withing 24 hrs itll result in termination. So i called and uplouded her doctors note explaining everything and how shes \"high risk pregnancy\" and they approved it and returned my time withing like 4-5 hrs.

Wonder what the fire to hire rate is. \n\nAs far as you taking a mental break, why not? My lowlife, piece of shit little brother has been unemployed for 3 months now. Just sits around drinking in someone else's basement (when he's not supposed to have alcohol in the house at all), sleeps all day and plays videogames all night. Guess he's only (beknownst to anyone else) left the house like 5x in 3 months. \n\nSo who's gonna stop ya? If you're able to take a break, might as well. Unless you're highly ambitious and motivated. Then you would probably go crazy doing nothing for more than a couple days or a week before you need to get back out there and climb the ranks.\n\nYeah, it seems i concealed a little rant in here.

I'm a homebody at heart but I work hard because that's what I'm there for. I was reaching my breaking point as mentioned in an earlier comment. I already applied to numerous jobs, but the waiting time inbetween drives me nuts, primarily because of shame than anything else.

But also when you reach 10 upt stop the leaving early or late arrival until it’s back up to 20 atleast. Or just wait until they offer vto . Most sites have an vto interest list you can sign up for at beginning of shift. I would ask about that as well , but stop letting yourself go into negative . If you have important things to take care of get an accommodation but it has to be important reason though. Can’t let easy cash flow get away lol . You may be eligible for rehire in 90 days .

      "# Post ID dr0x75: When do you finally decide to go to the doctor? with +1733 score by [(smallportrait, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/)\nI used part of my rent money (have to pay late now) to go to the doctor, because I thought I really needed to and that getting out of pain would be worth the sacrifice. I have had 8-10 canker sores in my throat and all over my mouth nonstop for the past few months. I don't ever have normal, non-painful days anymore. \n\nWell, I finally gave in and went to the doctor. Even the low income clinic here is a $60 visit. She gave me no answers. She told me it's stress related. Well, yes, I'm poor and stressed and that isn't something I can control or fix right now. No solutions, but I still have to pay 60. \n\nThis isn't the first time I felt like going to the doctor was fruitless. I'm to the point where I don't think I will ever go back to the doctor unless I am throwing up blood. It's all so useless.\n\nSo, my fellow poor friends, what's your red line? When do you decide it's time to see a doctor? I'm feeling like a fool right now for going.\n\n## Comment ID f6d8ujh with +571 score by [(grapholalia, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6d8ujh/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nUnless I'm bleeding, dying, or have been sick for months--I avoid the doctor.

I don't agree with the hyped-up cost of medicine in general, but you can't really judge the quality of healthcare by the end result when the presentation can vary. Had the user actually had something like renal cell carcinoma, $600 for a cancer diagnosis might seem cheap. That's one of the reasons I ask a patient so many questions and try to do a thorough exam when first seeing them- the more information I get, the better I can judge which tests are necessary and which aren't, which can hopefully save a patient some money.\n\n#### Comment ID f6hg7c6 with +1 score by [(the_real_fellbane, Reddit, 2019-11-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6hg7c6/) (in reply to ID f6deozt):\nI mean, it really is.

I knew exactly what was wrong with me and was under the care of a specialist. After more than three months of conservative treatment, my symptoms were continuing to worsen so we decided to do surgery and just fixed it. Insurance denied it three times. Finally, the day before my scheduled surgery and on the third denial, my arm stopped feeling like it was connected to my brain and was basically a heavy sack of meat. My doctor advised me to go to the ER for the hospital where he consults. It took four hours for the NP at the ER  to call him-after additional tests and meds I didn’t need. They did finally admit me, though, and insurance was finally like “ok, I guess you can have surgery to prevent permanent nerve damage.”  Insurance is a scam.\n\n#### Comment ID f6enmsx with +36 score by [(Melipuffles, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6enmsx/) (in reply to ID f6drvm8):\nUgh, I had chest pains back in February and went to an urgent care because I was pretty sure it was anxiety caused and they sent me to the ER and I got charged $800 after insurance for them to take some bloodwork and scans and go “yeah it’s most likely anxiety.” \n\nI was just hoping to get a refill of some anxiety medication I’ve used in the past, but because I take birth control they said it could’ve been a clot and rushed me to the ER.\n\n#### Comment ID f6dt6sl with +32 score by [(grapholalia, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6dt6sl/) (in reply to ID f6drvm8):\nI'm aware, but I was also in insane amounts of pain and talked to my sister (who is a nurse), and she advised me to go to the ER with my symptoms.

A regular gp can do it, but if the results indicate an issue you really need a specialist to diagnose what type and treat it. Look into state funded insurance or low income federal,  because you will need it. Unfortunately autoimmune disease is not so unlike cancer in that it can be very life threatening and won't generally improve on its own. I have heard of some people getting some relief by following an autoimmune diet where high inflammation foods like nightshades and refined carbohydrates are avoided, but it's only complimentary to treatment obviously. I have been dealing with lupus symptoms for 4 years now and it almost killed me last year when it attacked my kidneys. Please don't put your health care needs off.

One thing that helped me is those cough drops with actual numbing medicine in them - Cepacol is the brand, I think. They’re a little on the pricey side for cough drops (like $5ish I think for a pack of 16 or so?) but were a godsend towards the end of a rough day when I was simply at my wit’s end with the pain. Definitely not ideal, but not too bad if you use them sparingly for when you really can’t stand it.\n\nI also later found out I got more prone to them because I was prone to dry mouth - which, funny enough, was a side effect of a medication I was taking. I started using that biotene stuff regularly and drinking a TON of water and it really helped. Your sores might be due to any number of things, but if they’re related to dry mouth, that’d be pretty easy to determine and then relatively easy to fix. \n\nI’m so sorry you’re going through this, canker sores hurt SO much and any health issue without answers is maddening.

I wasn’t sleeping enough and i was working like 14 hour days between jobs. Switch to drinking alkaline water when you can. The acidity of water and your mouth just hurts them worse. Brush your teeth with baking soda at night before bed. Swishing baking soda water around your mouth during the day will also help too. \n\nIf you have a night where you know you can sleep in, plan to sleep as long as possible. I would even say take a benedryl or some cheaper sleep time aid just so you’re relaxed for a long time. Don’t do this regularly though because the ingredient in it means your brain doesn’t dream as much as it normally should do overtime you’ll feel more exhausted. For me I feel best if once a week I sleep for 10+ hours but that’s just me. If I’m not sleeping enough, it’s usually I need to wash my bedsheets or something. \n\nGood luck and honestly see where you can rearrange your schedule for your health, overlap days off if needed or be on that hunt for the elusive better paying job.\n\n### Comment ID f6e5gxn with +4 score by [(FiggNewton, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6e5gxn/) (in reply to ID f6dwhur):\nI take benedryl for everything.

HOWEVER, the er does not exist to diagnose, they don't exist to do anything past make sure that if you are in serious trouble, you can walk out of the er without that critical problem. \n\ni understand your back pain was absolutely terrible, but if they didn't find any life-threatening causes for it, they really don't have the time or space to diagnose something that has a myriad of causes that are not life-threatening. i know that sucks, it's part of the system we keep voting to maintain, but it's the truth. besides getting you hooked on pain medication, they can't do anything about your back pain, and keeping you longer in an attempt to diagnose would have shot your bill up like crazy when even a specialist wouldn't cost so much. \n\ni'm really sorry your experiences have turned you off to healthcare so much, but please know that family practice doctors don't make enough money to pay off their student loans, and usually live in loan-based poverty for 10+ years after becoming a doctor- they're not there for the money, they're there because they truly do care about their patients. i'm so incredibly sorry you didn't get to experience that.\n\n#### Comment ID f6fboxg with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6fboxg/) (in reply to ID f6edv3c):\n[deleted]\n\n## Comment ID f6dhio5 with +4 score by [(mcnicfer, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6dhio5/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nDon’t take this as medical advice, but have you googled at home treatments for canker sores?

It’s brutally expensive you get rushed through the door and nobody knows you or takes the time to talk to you so you get substandard care.

You pay $20 a year for access to real doctors via your phone. It’s only $1 per visit too! Basically, you chat with a doctor, and if need be, you take pictures with your phone if they need to see what you’re describing. I used it last week for an infection, got diagnosed, but before I could start the required medication, the doctor ordered a lab test for me at my local clinic (LabCorps). This was to see if I was healthy enough for the medication. Once the clinic sent back my results to the doctors at 98point6, they were able to prescribe me the medication and get it sent to my local pharmacy. I used GoodRx and brought the price of the medication down from $20 to $8. All in all, I spent $63 ($20 for the yearly 98point6 membership + $1 for initial visit + $33 for the blood test + $1 for second visit to discuss results and get prescription + $8 for the actual medicine). With my insurance, I would’ve paid more than that on just the doctor’s visit. I think it does jump to $100-something for the yearly membership with them after the first year, but I will gladly pay that next year. Obviously if you have an emergency you should totally call 911, but for something simple, 98point6 will do the trick. Really glad I ran across them and will continue spreading the word.

Do not feel bad, if you obtain a higher salary and insurance, it doesn't get much better. You will be making the same decisions n a cost-benefit analysis.\n\nThank you for attending my rant....\n\n## Comment ID f6f9j5o with +1 score by [(MirrorNexus, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6f9j5o/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nHmm I barely go to the doctor and when I have they've been useless, especially the last doctor, a gastro specialist, who after $1000 (would've been so much more without my work's insurance) entered the room as I was on the operating table and his very first words to me were like, \"so it seems you have cancer\" because he was reading my chart incorrectly, or the doctor who wrote the chart based on what I said wrote it incorrectly. And then they put me to sleep and did an upper endoscopy, and when I woke up he just said he wants to see me again to go over what they found, and they probably ran the wrong test, I should've been more specific (I was very specific with all my symptoms) and he walked away. And then later found out I wouldn't be able to get an appointment for 3 months, so I just bailed. They also prescribed a compounded medication that they weren't very sure would work and was expensive so fuck that I'm not taking something that might just make it worse I'll live with this as I have my whole life I guess. Also I worked at a mailorder pharmacy at the time so I got the privilege of seeing tons of doctors' prescriptions come through the system.\n\nSo I guess my answer is I'd get basic things if I had good insurance, and go to hospital if I'm throwing up blood or dying in some other way.\n\n### Comment ID f6gnndi with +1 score by [(moderndayathena, Reddit, 2019-11-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6gnndi/) (in reply to ID f6f9j5o):\nMy God, that's horrific I'm so sorry.

My Dr. scheduled an MRI with the local hospital  $ 2500 dollars..so I looked to a separate imaging facility $800 dollars. All of which would be out of pocket, since I had not reached my deductible However the imaging facilty said I could also get the same MRI for $400 cash, however it would not be reported to the insurance company, to come off of my deductible. I called Blue cross, and asked if I did this less expensive option, would they take off of my deductible if I reported it manually, and they said no! I mean I was gonna be out a few thousand over the upcoming surgery, and Blue Cross would have saved 400 bucks had they done that.

Spending $1000 on insulin is nothing compared to even one DKA episode ($100k bare minimum), plus any loss of income while you're recovering, plus any loss of reputation for calling in sick (let's not pretend that doesn't happen), plus the cost of late fees since you lost income and couldn't pay on time\n\nIf there is anyone UNDER 10 YEARS OLD in your home, YOU MUST KEEP ON HAND LIQUID TYLENOL AND LIQUID IBUPROFEN AT ALL TIMES AND IN ENOUGH AMOUNT that you'll have enough for 18 hours for the biggest one, but ideally all of them separately.\n\n#\n\nPredicting the future is required to conclusively know those factors, but if you sit down and think about it, you'd just be comparing yourself to your own past behavior.\n\n## Comment ID f6fr9h1 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6fr9h1/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\n[deleted]\n\n## Comment ID f6fs4zv with +1 score by [(PatchworkStar, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6fs4zv/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nI have hypothyroidism.

Put the suspension in your mouth, swish it around for 30 seconds to one minute, and spit it out. Do not swallow the rinse. \n\n**Topical medications to relieve pain**\n\n* Gels such as benzocaine (Orajel, Orabase) and [lidocaine](https://www.medicinenet.com/lidocaine_patch-topical/article.htm) (an anesthetic) are used directly on the canker sore to relieve pain or discomfort. Canker sore patches (Canker Cover) provide pain relief while covering and protecting the sore as it heals.

I rarely go to the doctor myself because of the cost. I lived with a double hernia for 5 years before I finally got enough money for the scan and the co-pay for the operation. The only time I've been to the ER was when I got hit by a car on my bike as a kid. A couple of years ago I had food poisoning really badly and was considering going, but it cleared up by the next day and although I felt weak, I was able to rest and take the day off work. \n\nI get those cold sores also. Here are some things that have helped me.\n\n\"Canker Cover\" patches. They absorb moisture and turn into a gelatin-like bubble to protect the sore. It helps a ton because the sores then don't get irritated by teeth touching them and such. If they're inside near your lips, they can be a little cumbersome because they'll be bumping your teeth as you try to talk, but still manageable. Link:  [https://www.amazon.com/DenTek-Canker-Cover-Patch-Relief/dp/B017GQYYXO](https://www.amazon.com/DenTek-Canker-Cover-Patch-Relief/dp/B017GQYYXO) \n\nOil-pulling: Take a tablespoon of coconut oil and slowly swish it around your mouth for about 20 minutes. You don't have to gargle, just gently move it around. It will absorb impurities and help your mouth get healthier. I did it every day for a couple of weeks and then went to once every 2 weeks, although I've neglected that for a few months now. I need to get back to it. Spit the oil out after 20 minutes, preferably in the trash with some paper towels. It solidifies at room temperature and may clog pipes. \n\nHydrogen peroxide rinse: Make a 50/50 mix of hydrogen peroxide and water and swish it around for about a minute. \n\nI can understand how you feel for having gone and not getting any help from the doctor. I get frustrated about that stuff too. I use Insight Timer app to do guided meditation to help me relax. I also take Magnesium and Theanine supplements that help with mood. If you get Insight Timer, let me know and I'll send you a couple of good meditations that I've found.\n\n## Comment ID f6h3hh2 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-11-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6h3hh2/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nIt's incredible that a thread like this even exists in the wealthiest nation in the world.

Do whatever you possibly can to afford health insurance - the lower-tier plans should be free with subsidies and the silver tier plans should be free or nearly free, especially if you're in the kind of straits that most folks here find themselves in.  Don't worry too much about coverage for severe injury and accidents since those will bankrupt you even with a pretty good silver plan (and even some gold plans, depending on whether or not you can afford to soak a few thousand dollars of deductible on top of the actual costs), what you want to make sure you get are at least a couple of biannual checkups/physicals for free, and ideally some kind of limited copay for specialist consults.\n\nYou will lose a ton of money by not going to see a doctor to get preventable illnesses and conditions addressed before they can become serious problems.  Infections lead to lost work.  Lost work leads to lost pay.  Lost pay can lead to a debt spiral that can literally take decades to escape.\n\nIn the meantime, make sure you are taking a daily multivitamin.  It's possible that malnutrition is contributing to these sores, and making it difficult for them to heal.  Shoestring \"bread and water\" budgets don't often make room for crucial micronutrients, and a once-a-day multi can help limit the damage.\n\nYou may also want to look into a bottle of Listerine or other mouth cleanser.  If you've got multiple open sores, that's bacteria and clearing your mouth and a throat gargle could help.  You can also try rinsing and gargling with warm salt water.\n\n## Comment ID f6hj2k7 with +1 score by [(heyieatjunk, Reddit, 2019-11-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6hj2k7/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nI feel really sorry for you.

It’s pretty common for me to get 5-10 in my mouth. So I did a bunch of research once in desperation and found someone say to take L-Lysine, a vitamin and that it cuts the healing time. I took it and oh my god does it work. Now I take it whenever it feels like I’m about to get some and it prevents it.\n\nApparently some people have a vitamin deficiency, I guess from a lack of it in the diet that makes them more common. I get them when I’m stressed because stress can cause your immune system to weaken and allows the virus that lives in your mouth to run rampant. Anyway, take it, it’s cheap and it works. Also, get some numbing spray for the throat that’s what I do when they are killing me and I can’t sleep.\n\nEdit: P.S. do not gargle with peroxide, peroxide does kill bacteria but it also damages cells and since the wound is in your mouth the virus just gets more contact with the open wound causing them to get worse. Salt water can help, but gods does it hurt and I’ve never had them go away from it. By the way, my doctor told me the only real thing they can do is give you a antivirus like the one they give you for the flu, but  not many doctors will do that since they go away on their own.\n\n### Comment ID f6hylwt with +1 score by [(Nikeagogo79, Reddit, 2019-11-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6hylwt/) (in reply to ID f6hlddl):\nI can vouch for (admittedly anecdotal) success with L-Lysine.

If you have sick fish, you give them fish meds. Apparently they are the same ones given to humans, so when my fish are sick... I used to give them fish meds. :)\n\nAs far as your canker sores go, do you drink juice or eat a lot of citrus? That always causes them for me. I think some people react to spicy food also. I think there's a product called camphophenique that helps. There's something else out there also that coats over it until it heals.\n\n## Comment ID f6i6diz with +1 score by [(galaxystarsmoon, Reddit, 2019-11-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6i6diz/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nI don't know if anyone has said this and I'm not scrolling through 600+ comments to find out, but try changing your toothpaste. Also, if you drink diet soda, cut that. Those sores are usually caused by a pH issue in the mouth.\n\n## Comment ID f6iad9u with +1 score by [(acornstu, Reddit, 2019-11-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6iad9u/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nAside from a gaping wound needing stitches and a motorcycle wreck where i tried to fight a 72' Ford pickup i shattered my heel and ankle.

It is a common cause of aphthous ulcers which can be mistaken for canker sores. Try some products without this compound for about a month and see if that helps.\n\n## Comment ID f6ibx1i with +1 score by [(hayilak_, Reddit, 2019-11-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6ibx1i/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nI don’t get sick often but when I do I get so afraid because I know I have to see a doctor that I cannot afford.

And that is\n\nDoctor Office Visits\n\nAND\n\nLab Work\n\nAre two different departments. A doctor is only as good as the lab work requested. \n\nIf I just have a cold, I dont bother going because there isnt anything the doctor can do. I just need to have plenty of fluids - clean water and maybe some orange juice, plenty of rest. And take things for symptoms.\n\nIf I suspect I have the flu OR I am frequently getting sick every month or so, I will talk to a doctor but with the impression they will run blood work.\n\nDo these things cost money? Yeah. Sometimes clinics are the way to go since it might be cheaper. 60-100 $ for an officr visit and 60-100% for lab work. It does help to have a clinic you like going to and building up a report with them and as they get to know more about you medically it can help to have a quicker diagnosis.\n\nOr\n\nUrgent Care / ER, I tell them I have no insurance and bill me later. The bill can range from a couple hundred dollars to 1k, unless you get admitted then good luck. Try not to get admitted unless its life threatening. The upside to this is you dont have to pay out of pocket right then and there. I have did this in between jobs.\n\n## Comment ID f6jlu1w with +1 score by [(callmekohai, Reddit, 2019-11-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6jlu1w/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nOff topic, but as someone with cronic canker sores for years, using an antiseptic mouth rinse after every meal (and usually brushing and flossing after every meal) helped a bunch. Orajel has a great one, but if thats too pricy, salt water will also work well to sanitize your mouth. Using Oral anesthetic/Benzocaine really helps with the sores you can reach to apply it to, and it numbs the surrounding area to help with overall pain\n\n## Comment ID f6elw2o with +1 score by [(comehomedarling, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6elw2o/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nRe: your health: I’m guessing you have looked up remedies, so you might already tried this one—gargle warm salt water?\n\n## Comment ID f6eruxg with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dr0x75/when_do_you_finally_decide_to_go_to_the_doctor/f6eruxg/) (in reply to ID dr0x75):\nNever.

This lack of consideration for customer satisfaction is disappointing and raises questions about the service's commitment to improving and addressing customer needs. I hope that you will take this feedback into consideration and implements a system that allows customers to express their concerns and provide feedback in the future.\n\nOver the past week, my children have been home sick from school, and we have been cautious about having any visitors. Unfortunately, I have been experiencing symptoms that lead me to suspect I may have contracted strep throat, although I cannot be entirely certain. In an attempt to seek medical advice conveniently, I decided to utilize the 98.6 app, a service provided by our employer. Previously, we had been using Teldoc for the past 20 years, but our employer recently switched to 98.6, which has proven to be an inconvenience and a waste of time, with no added convenience.\n\nDuring my recent interaction with the 98.6 app, I had the opportunity to consult with the FNP-BC, a Nurse Practitioner based in New York, NY. As a provider responsible for handling calls from subscribed employees, it is crucial that her professionalism and respect reflect the value of the service that employers pay for. The purpose of this service is to provide employees with prompt and convenient care, and it is essential that her behavior aligns with this objective.\n\nUnfortunately, my experience with Nurse  was far from satisfactory. After expressing a differing opinion, she abruptly terminated the visit, displaying a lack of professionalism and cowardice. It is concerning to think that someone with such behavior is responsible for caring for patients. I strongly urge you to review her patient transcripts for overall patient satisfaction and consider the impact her actions may have on the reputation of the service.",

I told the doctor my issue and asked if it were possible for a script (nothing with painkillers or anything they aren’t allowed to prescribe), to which the doctor essentially ignored me and recommended things I have been doing to no avail throughout being sick. I informed the doctor that his advice was not something that was working, however I would give one of his solutions a try (it was clear he had no interest in helping me, as my primary care would have) and wrapped up the conversation asap. Again, I like the concept of this app; I think it’s a great idea…just not so much the staff that partners with the app. It all felt impersonal and like a quick cash grab.",

Also, from my experience the physicians are not well qualified and don’t take your symptoms into consideration whatsoever. For example: I have had a sore throat for almost 2 weeks now and can never get to the doctors office because they work the same hours I do… I told the doctor my symptoms and told him that I have been taking antihistamines and nasal spray that have been working but my throat is still killing me; he proceeded to prescribe me the same antihistamines and nasal spray that I had already been taking none of which would help my throat whatsoever… It also takes a good 30-45 minutes to finish your appointment because it’s ALL texting. Long story short, Doctor On Demand is the way to go if you want a doctor who will actually take you seriously and respect your time.",

Then there were layoffs and more employees at all levels left on their own. Goals have not changed. More have been added and all dead lines were kept the same. Of course when these deadlines are not met the next company meeting is negative with a lot of general blaming and saying we all just need to work harder. Communication overall has been terrible with \"we don't know yet\" being the usual answer for any concerns. Weeks without answers. Any answers are just as rushed and poorly thought out as the changes. This toxic attitude is starting with the top level but you can see it affecting teams as they feel more pressure.",

Then there were layoffs and more employees at all levels left on their own. Goals have not changed. More have been added and all dead lines were kept the same. Of course when these deadlines are not met the next company meeting is negative with a lot of general blaming and saying we all just need to work harder. Communication overall has been terrible with \"we don't know yet\" being the usual answer for any concerns. Weeks without answers. Any answers are just as rushed and poorly thought out as the changes. This toxic attitude is starting with the top level but you can see it affecting teams as they feel more pressure.",

I sincerely enjoy the company of the people who work here.\n\nA lot of companies have a list of core values that employees can rattle off, but rarely do you see them weave the core values into everything they do. 98point6 really does weave their core values into all of their work, from the interview process to our day-to-day interactions.\n\nThe company adapted well to remote work during the pandemic, and is being very thoughtful about how we adapt and cater to all employees as we move to a hybrid environment.\n\nRelentless Improvement is a core value that I've seen the company take seriously. I've seen leadership act on feedback given by employees, and continual improvements made in policies and processes, such as our interview process. Leadership and the company doesn't get things right 100% of the time, but they are passionate about making improvements when opportunities arise and when we are put in situations where the company needs to adapt.",

Then there were layoffs and more employees at all levels left on their own. Goals have not changed. More have been added and all dead lines were kept the same. Of course when these deadlines are not met the next company meeting is negative with a lot of general blaming and saying we all just need to work harder. Communication overall has been terrible with \"we don't know yet\" being the usual answer for any concerns. Weeks without answers. Any answers are just as rushed and poorly thought out as the changes. This toxic attitude is starting with the top level but you can see it affecting teams as they feel more pressure.",

      "# [Celebrating One Year, One Team, One Place – Transcarent](https://transcarent.com/blog/celebrating-one-year-one-team-one-place)\nGlen Tullman, Chief Executive Officer, Transcarent\n\nBuilding great businesses is something that I love to do, and part of that includes knowing when and how to effectively scale. Acquisitions allow companies to grow by incorporating existing innovations, increasing market share, and many times, expanding the workforce for greater impact. In my 30+ years of building businesses, I have led dozens of mergers and acquisitions of all sizes and on both sides of the transaction. Having witnessed many successes and a few pitfalls, I believe that a shared mission and like-cultures are strong determinants of whether or not a transaction will be successful.\n\nI always say that it is easier to fix something, than to start from scratch. So long as the leadership teams who are involved in a transaction share similar values and relentlessly believe that together, they can deliver a better experience for the end user, M&A activity can be incredibly powerful, improve outcomes and business operations, and be a smart investment.\n\nWhen I first met with the team at 98point6, the leader in AI-enabled virtual care, I saw the value their technology, their clinic, and their wildly talented team, could bring to the future of Transcarent and our Members. With experience dating back to 2017 they were forward-thinking, ahead of the curve in healthcare AI, had a robust portfolio of clients and Members, and most importantly, shared a similar mission as Transcarent. Simply put, they were committed to making health and care better for people, including the physicians and others who deliver care and those of us who receive it. They were looking for directional support, commitment, and leadership that would put their technology in the hands of many more people . . . a strength of ours at Transcarent, and we were in search of forward-looking technology that could transform the virtual primary care experience. After our first discussions, the transaction was complete.\n\nOver the past year, our teams came together with the mindset of “one.” One Team. One Mission. One Place for Health and Care. This cultural mindset was ingrained from the start and made for a nearly flawless integration. Yes, we dropped a few balls along the way, but people always knew what our intent was . . . to make this the best place people ever worked and to create an experience of health and care that was new, better, and different than anything else they had come across. I am proud to say we can celebrate one year as one company that has undeniably achieved more together than we ever could have achieved alone.\n\nNothing is more important than our health and care. And no industry will have more impact on our success as a country in the future. However, despite its importance, no industry is more in need of change and improvement. 98point6 made it easy to access care 24x7x365 – easier and faster than ever before – without losing the physician connection. Since acquiring 98point6, we have continued to invest in their revolutionary AI-powered health and care experience. We even had the opportunity to highlight in front of Congress how we are delivering an experience, leading with clinical expertise, from start to finish, that is private and secure, and built to meet and exceed the needs of health consumers. Additionally, we introduced point-of-care navigation capabilities by combining the power of Transcarent's digital platform and benefit ecosystem with virtual care delivery. Expect to hear more from us regarding AI and the ways it will transform virtual primary care visits.\n\nOne of the things we are most proud of is that we are leveraging one of our greatest assets, clinicians, for the part of the visits that require their intellect and experience. Due to the personal nature of this industry, we can’t rely on technology alone. When considering the acquisition with 98point6, their affiliated Physician Group was one of the strongest selling points. The talented and caring physicians, nurses, and other clinicians who comprise the group complete the experience we’re trying to create at Transcarent . . . one that people love, offers high-quality health and care, and does so at a price that people can afford.\n\nWhen we founded Transcarent, we knew the vision of bringing all of health and care, both virtual and in-person, together on a single platform, wasn’t going to be easy or fast. But we’re here, committed as ever, with a steadfast focus on our mission of providing access to high-quality, affordable health and care. We’ve taken the steps necessary, including M&A activity and integrating other innovative solutions into our platform, to build an easy-to-use platform for our Members and clients and company for our employees.\n\nOur work is well underway, we’ve come a long way, but as Bill Gates wisely said, “If I'd had some set idea of a finish line, don't you think I would have crossed it years ago?”\n\nThanks to everyone at Transcarent for your hard work and commitment to making the last year a success.",

      "# [Powered Consumer Health Experience – Transcarent](https://transcarent.com/press-releases/transcarent-introduces-wayfinding-an-ai-powered-consumer-health-experience)\nSan Francisco, CA May 15, 2024 - Today, Transcarent, the One Place for Health and Care, announced WayFinding, a new experience that seamlessly combines generative AI with instant access to care providers to integrate benefits navigation, clinical guidance, and care delivery on one easy to use platform. WayFinding personalizes each person’s experience, orienting and guiding them through their health and care journeys, with human support never more than a tap away.\n\nWayFinding provides Members with personalized support and guidance, beginning with questions about what’s covered and what it might cost. It moves them seamlessly to the next best clinical action to take through specific guidance, and then instantly connects them to medical professionals or provides direct access into digital point solutions uniquely suited to address specific issues.\n\nAccording to a 2023 KFF poll, more than 50 percent of insured adults in America say it is difficult to understand at least some aspect of their health insurance. Forty percent of Americans with employer sponsored coverage said they didn’t understand what their health insurance covers, while 27 percent lacked understanding about specific terms their health insurance uses such as \"deductible,\" \"copay,\" and \"co-insurance.\" Increasing a person’s access to benefits information is critical as uncertainty often leads to unexpected cost, and medical debt is the number one cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. Most Americans find their healthcare to be more confusing, more complex, and more costly than ever before and getting worse, not better, with 70 percent feeling failed by the healthcare system.\n\nWayFinding addresses this complexity, uniquely combining new advancements made possible through generative AI with better information and on-demand access to clinicians, along with access to virtual point solutions and local in-person care. With WayFinding, Transcarent Members can access the care they deserve and employers can be confident their benefits are being used efficiently and effectively.\n\n“Imagine if you could go to one place, 24 hours a day, to access all your benefits, get the unbiased medical guidance you need, and then have instant access to a doctor or other healthcare professional or connect to the leading point solutions with no separate logins and membership cards needed. That’s what we’ve all been dreaming about and today Transcarent is delivering on that vision,” said Glen Tullman, Chief Executive Officer of Transcarent. “This is not just better than traditional navigation, it’s completely different. It’s like moving from a flip phone to an iPhone. The flip phone did one thing. The iPhone does everything. And we’re doing it all at half the price of traditional navigators.”\n\nThe launch of WayFinding builds on Transcarent's earlier work to responsibly incorporate AI-enabled care into the Member experience, starting with the acquisition of the 98point6 care platform, the industry-leading AI-powered care delivery solution, which facilitates immediate access to high-quality, virtual care. Using our database of close to one million documented physician chats, which informs our proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs), paired with significant investments in building an AI team over the last year, Transcarent is set apart from others in the industry. Additionally, Transcarent uses custom testing, validation, and monitoring tools to enable responsible AI development and has built a proprietary multi-pronged safety system that acts as a common safety layer across all our AI products. Our membership in and work with the Data & Trust Alliance has also informed how to use AI safely and securely.\n\nWayFinding is the answer to the challenge of getting people the right information, when and where they need it. It also reduces the burden on human resources and benefits professionals, having to spend hours answering questions from confused employees. WayFinding will drive significant improvements in utilization and engagement.\n\n“WayFinding orients you. By pulling in every detail of an employer’s plan, any offered ancillary benefits, your medical history, and pairing that information with our team of top-rated virtual care clinical specialists, we can create a personalized understanding of each Member’s unique care needs, getting them exactly where they need to be every single time,” said Snezana Mahon, PharmD, Chief Operating Officer of Transcarent. “Your health and care should know you. With WayFinding, that’s now possible. This is the future of navigation and more.”\n\nTranscarent has a proven track record of delivering care experiences that Members value, returning to the experience time and again to meet their health and care needs. Of the Transcarent Members that activate, our 70 percent utilization and retention rates demonstrate that we are delivering on our mission of making it easy to access high-quality, affordable health and care.\n\nClick here to schedule a WayFinding demo.\n\nAbout Transcarent\n\nTranscarent is the One Place for Health and Care. We cut through complexity, making it easy for people to access high-quality, affordable health and care. We create a personalized experience tailored for each Member, including an on-demand care team, and a connected ecosystem of high-quality, in-person care and virtual point solutions. Transcarent eliminates the guesswork and empowers Members to make better decisions about their health and care.\n\nTranscarent is aligned with those who pay for healthcare and takes accountability for results – offering at-risk pricing models and transparent impact reporting to ensure incentives support a measurably better experience, better health, and lower costs.

      "# [Major Players: Meet 38 of the Top Companies in Seattle Tech by Matthew Urwin on 2024-11-07](https://www.builtinseattle.com/articles/largest-companies-seattle-tech)\nWhile its neighbors to the south steal most of the West Coast attention, Seattle boasts a stunning landscape that features hiking trails, stunning vistas, and the majestic slopes of Mount Rainier. That’s why many tech professionals view the Emerald City as a breath of fresh air compared to the hustle and bustle of Silicon Valley. According to the CBRE Tech Talent report, Seattle remains a top destination for college graduates looking to jumpstart their careers.\n\nCompanies like Starbucks and Microsoft may have propelled Seattle into relevance, but the region has since attracted dozens of top companies. With a sprawling network of startups and businesses, Seattle has cemented its place on the list of top tech hubs.

      "# [Compassionate Cancer Care: How Employers Can Support Both Patients and Caregivers by Zoë Harte, the University of Exeter on 2024-10-09](https://www.springhealth.com/blog/employer-cancer-care-support)\nThere's one word that can instantly change someone's life and the lives of those who love them: cancer.\n\nIt's a diagnosis that affects millions of people globally, touching not just individuals, but entire families and communities. As HR leaders and employers, we have a unique opportunity—and responsibility—to support our team members through this challenging journey.\n\nThat’s why at Transcarent, we're here for our Members every step of the way through cancer. We've recently teamed up with Spring Health to bring top-notch mental health support right into our platform.\n\nWhy? We believe people deserve a community of care that truly understands what they’re going through and offers the very best support during what might be the most difficult period of their lives.\n\nThe need for comprehensive support\n\nAfter spending more than 25 years in human resources, including my current role as Chief People Officer at Transcarent, I've seen firsthand how cancer impacts our workforce. I also understand this issue on a deeply personal level. Both of my parents passed away from cancer in recent years.\n\nSomething I took away from those experiences is that every cancer journey is unique, and transformative. The complexity of decisions—from treatment options to finding caregiver support—can be overwhelming.\n\nIt’s difficult to know what the correct course of action should be in the middle of this complexity. What treatment regime should you follow? As a caregiver, how do you get support for your own mental health while holding up the person going through treatment? Is it possible to balance work and treatment or caregiving?\n\nThe whole person shows up at work\n\nGone are the days when we understood our \"work selves\" and \"real lives\" as separate. The past few years have highlighted a simple but profound truth: we bring our whole selves to work.\n\nAs HR leaders, we have the privilege and responsibility to support all aspects of our employees' lives, including their most vulnerable moments.\n\nI’ve had employees share cancer diagnoses and fertility challenges with me, needing to understand their benefits before talking to their families. This level of trust is a gift, and we must be prepared to honor it.\n\nA holistic approach to cancer support\n\nWhen we talk about cancer care, there’s more to it than scans and treatments. Care is also about supporting mental health and lifting up the unsung heroes—caregivers. Yet mental health often takes a backseat.\n\nGlobally, depression among those with cancer is estimated to be 27%. Other research suggests that 35-40% of people with cancer have a diagnosable mental health challenge affecting their quality of life.\n\nThe ups and downs take a toll on mental health\n\nCancer can be the most terrible emotional roller coaster, parked directly in the middle of a family's life.\n\nWhen my dad was living with cancer, there were times when we thought he’d be okay and that we’d have years left with him. And that would change, week to week, day to day, before he passed. His experience was completely different from my mum’s, who had cancer and dementia. One thing both experiences had in common is that the mental health of our family and support system was deeply challenged.\n\nNo employee should have to choose between treating their body or mind—both are essential for healing, which is why holistic support is so necessary.\n\nIn the sections that follow, we'll explore specific ways to implement a holistic support system, ensuring that no employee faces cancer alone.\n\nComprehensive support throughout the cancer journey\n\nSo, what might comprehensive support look like?\n\nAt Transcarent, we support people through every phase of their cancer journey, from screening through initial diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship. When a Member first reaches out, we discuss their diagnosis, staging, and treatment options. Our Oncology Nurse Navigators provide education, expertise, and, most importantly, compassionate support.\n\nI spoke with Nicole Reimer, Transcarent’s Director of the Oncology Nurse Navigator program for this blog. She’s been an Oncology Nurse for over 30 years and shared an insightful example of how we provide support for employees:\n\n\"Sometimes our Members want to speak with their Oncology Nurse Navigator every day for support, especially those facing challenges as caregivers. This is what we’re here for—to connect with and educate people so they feel confident in taking the next step.”\n\nAddressing mental health: a key component of cancer care\n\nWe begin each new Member intake by explaining the NCCN distress thermometer, which assesses the person’s current state and identifies specific sources of distress, whether financial difficulties, fear, or other factors. Understanding the root causes of anguish is essential to addressing it effectively.\n\nFor people undergoing cancer treatment and their caregivers, we always ask:\n\nHow are you coping with this?\n\nWhat is your support system?\n\nWhat helps make it better?\n\nWhat specific things do you need help with?\n\nBased on their responses, we create a personalized plan that may consist of comprehensive mental health support, including an Employee Assistance Program (EAP). We can also connect them with mental health experts who can provide guidance, a listening ear, and evidence-based coping strategies.\n\nTaking care of the caregivers\n\nIt's highly likely that employees within your organization work full-time, care for a family member with cancer, raise children, and/or support other dependents.\n\nCaregivers of people with cancer are often overlooked when it comes to mental health support. While the focus naturally centers on the person with cancer, it's crucial to remember that caregivers need support too—not just for their own well-being, but to be better equipped to care for their loved ones.\n\nAs Nicole pointed out, \"Taking care of the caregiver is not selfish. In order for someone to be the most effective caregiver, they have to take care of themselves.\"\n\nThe need for caregiver support is significant. A recent meta-analysis showed that about 42% of for cancer caregivers experience depression. This statistic underscores the importance of extending workplace support to this often-overlooked group.\n\nInterestingly, Nicole has observed a shift in who's reaching out for help: \"Every day, I’m speaking to caregivers who are so grateful to have this resource.\" This trend highlights the growing awareness of caregiver needs and the importance of addressing them.\n\nThe phrase \"you cannot pour from an empty cup\" may be overused, but it's profoundly true in this context. When I think about my own experiences as a caretaker, I imagine a pressure valve: without proper mental health support and self-care, the stress, anxiety, and depression of caregiving can build up and cause harm. There needs to be a healthy form of release.\n\nWhat can employers do?\n\nNormalizing asking for help and allowing people space to care for themselves at work can make a world of difference. As I experienced during my parents' illness, the humanity and support of team members can be invaluable during difficult times. Nicole pointed out, “My conversations with people illustrate that individual managers have a bigger impact than employers on the lives of employees with cancer.\"\n\nOften, support can be as simple as managers listening, being engaged, and asking, \"How can I support you and the people you love right now?\"\n\nHere are other concrete steps organizations can take:\n\nEnsure employees understand the benefits available concerning cancer care.\n\nOffer a dedicated cancer care solution.\n\nOffer comprehensive mental health support.\n\nProvide schedule flexibility for both those undergoing treatment and caregivers.\n\nPromote a supportive culture that openly discusses mental health.\n\nMake a public commitment to supporting employees with actions like signing the Working with Cancer pledge.\n\nDirect employees toward resource groups, mentorship, and survivorship support networks.\n\nReturning to work after treatment\n\nThe need for support doesn't end when treatment is over. Returning to work after cancer treatment brings its own set of challenges, particularly regarding mental health. It's not as simple as \"You're better, so get back to work.\" Reentry can be challenging and non-linear, which is both normal and okay.\n\nThe key is to give employees agency over their return whenever possible. Ask questions like, \"How do you want to handle reentry? What do you want me to tell your team members about your return to work?\"\n\nEmployees may need ongoing support, including:\n\nGradual return to full-time work\n\nContinued scheduling flexibility\n\nMental health support\n\nAccess to survivorship programs\n\nRegular check-ins with their manager and HR leader\n\nThis level of support is particularly crucial in the first year after treatment.\n\nExtending compassionate care\n\nWhat I want HR and benefits leaders to remember is that cancer's impact extends beyond the person diagnosed. Your caregiving employees are carrying heavy burdens. By embracing both groups with strong, thoughtful support systems, you're not only helping individuals—you’re building a workplace where empathy and resilience can thrive.\n\nOffering compassionate, comprehensive cancer care isn't just the right thing to do—it's also an investment in your most valuable asset: your people. When you support your team through life's toughest challenges, they'll go above and beyond for you in return.",

      "# [Expert Tips For High Availability Through Workload Orchestration by Expert Panel® on 2024-12-02](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/12/02/expert-tips-for-high-availability-through-workload-orchestration/)\nMaintaining a seamless, uninterrupted user experience is central to effective workload orchestration. With today’s tech environments spanning on-premises and cloud networks, diverse teams, and connected devices, flexible and well-considered strategies are essential.\n\nIt’s a complex challenge, and expert advice can be invaluable. Below, members of Forbes Technology Council share their experience and advice for developing an effective workload orchestration system. Tap into their expertise to help your team deliver reliable, optimized services and an excellent user experience.\n\n1. Integrate Multicloud Platforms With Automated Failover\n\nBy integrating multicloud platforms with automated failover mechanisms, workloads can dynamically shift from one cloud provider to another in the event of an outage, ensuring minimal downtime. This also allows for the application of load balancing techniques that dynamically distribute traffic across multiple regions, ensuring optimal performance while preventing overload on any single node. - Bhaskar Gangipamula, Quadrant Technologies\n\n2. Combine Workload Distribution With Monitoring And Recovery\n\nThe strategy should include two parts. First, have workloads distributed across multiple availability zones to ensure high availability. Second, have monitoring and recovery systems in place that include prompt alerts, self-healing capabilities and regular backups. - Ravi Laudya, SAP Concur\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify?\n\n3. Leverage Container Orchestration\n\nA strategy for high availability and fault tolerance is to use container orchestration tools like Kubernetes. These tools split your app into smaller containers distributed across multiple servers. If one server fails, Kubernetes automatically shifts the workload to the other, healthy containers, ensuring minimal downtime and uninterrupted service—like a backup system that keeps everything running smoothly. - KJ Dhaliwal, Lotus Health AI\n\n4. Set Up Autonomous AI Agents\n\nAutonomous AI agents provide real value by analyzing patterns in system logs, performance metrics and error rates. They can proactively detect issues before they result in downtime. By identifying anomalies and predicting potential failures, these agents can trigger preventive actions, such as scaling resources, rerouting traffic or spinning up services, to ensure high availability. - Manjula Iyer, 98point6 Technologies\n\n5. Consider This Three-Step Approach\n\nHaving built a high-availability and fault-tolerant VoIP soft switch, we took three major steps. First, we deployed across multiple cloud providers to eliminate outages caused by underlying data center failures. Second, end-user devices were registered to different nodes, preventing the entire site from experiencing issues. Lastly, we utilized active-active environments that are always in sync, allowing us to reprioritize traffic in real time. - Hamed Mazrouei, Milagro\n\n6. Validate Your Availability And Fault Tolerance In Noncrisis Situations\n\nThere is no substitute for validating your high availability and fault tolerance strategy on a regular basis in noncrisis situations. Make needed adjustments during these validation periods to improve the durability of your solution. A best practice would be to spend the appropriate amount of time up front designing the strategy and then validating it with current operations to make updates as required. - Russ Kennedy, Nasuni\n\n7. Use A Hybrid Setup\n\nAn effective strategy is using a multicloud or hybrid setup. This spreads workloads across different cloud providers, reducing the risk of downtime. Combine this with auto-scaling and load balancing, which adjust resources based on demand, and use automation to detect and fix issues early, keeping systems running smoothly without manual intervention. - Ehsan Ahmadi, Vox Solutions\n\n8. Leverage A Microservices-Based Architecture\n\nA microservices-based architecture helps prevent single points of failure by distributing functionality. Design services to be idempotent and stateless, decoupling state to enhance resilience and scalability. Utilize self-healing orchestration tools like Kubernetes, and adopt active-active configurations for data and state management to ensure continuous availability and robust fault tolerance. - Koushik Sundar, Citibank\n\n9. Build A Decoupled System\n\nYou can achieve high availability and fault tolerance in many ways, but at what cost? Tools like Kubernetes and load balancers can help. But to effectively achieve high availability and fault tolerance, you should build a decoupled system so that different components are isolated and have only the necessary dependencies between them. This will allow you to orchestrate the workload only for those components that require it. - Oleg Lola, MobiDev\n\n10. Focus On Optimization\n\nOne strategy for ensuring high availability and fault tolerance through effective workload orchestration is to focus on optimization. Not every node needs the same amount of processing power; it’s important to have load balance functionality and do stress testing to stay ahead of the game. - Syed Ahmed, Act-On Software\n\n11. Follow The Principle That ‘Everything Fails, All The Time’\n\nThis may be a bit more philosophical, but when designing any critical system, I follow this principle: “Everything fails, all the time.” This mindset drives designs that eliminate single points of failure, favor distributed systems with “shared nothing” architecture, and incorporate queuing mechanisms. Though it’s often overlooked, non-software resilience—like multiregion deployments and robust network configurations—is also important, even in the cloud. - Elliott Cordo, Data Futures\n\n12. Use Containerization And Automated Scaling\n\nOne effective way to keep things running smoothly is to use containerization and automated scaling. This allows you to isolate applications, which makes them consistent across environments. Orchestrators help by automatically managing these containers and distributing workloads evenly while monitoring for failures. When an issue is detected, the orchestrator can adjust with little to no downtime. - Thomas Griffin, OptinMonster\n\n13. Implement Messaging Queues And Asynchronous Processing Patterns\n\nBased on our experience building healthcare apps, implementing message queues and asynchronous processing patterns is essential. By decoupling services and using tools like RabbitMQ, we create buffer zones that prevent system overload. If one component slows down, messages stay in the queue until processing capacity recovers. - Marc Fischer, Dogtown Media LLC\n\n14. Utilize Active-Passive Failover Architectures\n\nUtilize active-passive failover architectures by designing your system with an active instance and a passive standby. The passive instance takes over in the event of a failure, ensuring minimal downtime. - Manasi Sharma, Microsoft\n\n15. Ensure Multiple Redundancies\n\nUse redundant hardware, software and network components. Implement load balancing to evenly distribute workloads and clustering to allow multiple servers to operate as a single system, improving performance. Utilize database replication to ensure data accessibility across locations, even during failures. Together, these strategies ensure high availability and fault tolerance, creating a resilient infrastructure. - Brian Sathianathan, Iterate.ai\n\n16. Use Service Mesh Architecture With Open-Source Tools\n\nOne overlooked strategy I would like to highlight is using service mesh architecture with open-source tools like Istio or Linkerd. By abstracting network traffic management between services, you gain fine-grained control over load balancing, retries and automatic failovers. This approach will ensure high availability and fault tolerance without adding complexity to the application code. - Santhosh Vijayabaskar\n\n17. Implement ‘Degraded Mode’ Capabilities\n\nImplement “degraded mode” capabilities across all critical services. Instead of binary up-down states, design systems to gracefully reduce functionality when under stress. For example, disable real-time updates while keeping core transactions running, or serve cached data instead of live queries. This ensures business continuity even during partial failures. - Chandra Kuchi, Robinhood\n\n18. Take A Proactive Approach",

      "# [Mt. Joy (restaurant) by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2024-03-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Joy_(restaurant))\nRestaurant chain based in Seattle, Washington, U.S.\n\nMt. Joy is a restaurant chain specializing in chicken sandwiches, based in Seattle, Washington. The business launched a food truck on Capitol Hill in September 2023, followed by a brick-and-mortar restaurant on December 1. Ethan Stowell is among the co-owners of Mt. Joy, which specializes in fried chicken sandwiches.\n\nDescription\n\n[edit]\n\nMt. Joy has been described as a fast-casual restaurant chain specializing in chicken sandwiches that \"focuses on pasture-raised chickens sourced from local farms who have an environmentally-friendly focus\", according to The Seattle Times.[1] The magazine Seattle Metropolitan has said the sandwiches \"double as a means to overhaul agricultural processes that contribute to climate change\".[2] Mt. Joy bills itself as the \"first ever regenerative-focused\" restaurant in the Pacific Northwest.[3]\n\nThe business operates a brick-and-mortar restaurant on Seattle's Capitol Hill, as well as a food truck. The restaurant's interior has shades of green and white.[4] Spicy or mild versions of fried chicken sandwiches have breasts or thighs, as well as lettuce, tomato, and a house sauce on a brioche bun.[2] Mt. Joy also serves a portobello sandwich.[5] The menu also includes chicken tenders,[6] milkshakes, as well as French fries with five dipping sauces made in-house.[2] Mt. Joy sources ingredients locally and also serves beer. The custom buns are made by Franz Bakery.[2]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nConception and development\n\n[edit]\n\nRobbie Cape conceived of the business after watching Kiss the Ground, a 2020 documentary film about regenerative agriculture; he recruited regenerative farmer Grant Jones to co-found the restaurant, and also brought on chef and restaurateur Ethan Stowell to be a partner.[1][2][7]\n\nIn October 2022, The Seattle Times reported that owners hoped to open the first restaurant in Seattle by the Fall 2023, with additional locations planned throughout the Pacific Northwest. Mt. Joy's three-day pop-up and fried chicken sandwich test run was held at the Capitol Hill location of Stowell's Italian restaurant Tavolàta in October 2022.[1][2] The chickens were supplied by Hungry Hollow, Jones's family farm in Shelton, Washington.[8] During the pop-up, Mt. Joy also served the portobello sandwich, fries, and three varieties of milkshakes (chocolate, huckleberry, and vanilla).[8] Mt. Joy had another three-day pop-up at Stowell's restaurant Rione XIII in May 2023.[9][10][11]\n\nFirst food truck and brick-and-mortar restaurant\n\n[edit]\n\nIn September 2023, Mt. Joy launched a food truck on East Olive Way, in the parking lot of a former Starbucks shop. According to GeekWire, Mt. Joy had fifteen employees at the time.[5][12] Mt. Joy also announced plans to open a brick-and-mortar restaurant on Capitol Hill,[13] on the ground level of the Sunset Electric apartment building near the intersection of 11th and Pine Street.[3][14]\n\nThe restaurant opened on December 1, 2023, with a reported $1.5 million in funding from multiple investors.[15][16] Harry Cheadle of Eater Seattle noted how Mt. Joy opened in close proximity to multiple fried chicken eateries,[17] and even launched the same week as a Dave's Hot Chicken restaurant.[18] In addition to Hungry Hollow, four other farms in Western Washington have supplied chickens to Mt. Joy, as of late 2023.[18]\n\nAccording to Eater Seattle, the owners hope to expand to thousands of locations.[8]\n\nLeadership\n\n[edit]\n\nCape is the chief executive officer. Pat Snavely is another founding partner as well as chief marketing officer.[8] Justin Kaufman is a co-founder as well as Mt. Joy's chief technology officer.[7]\n\nDionne Himmelfarb, who has been a chef for Stowell, is the chief culinary officer,[2] and Jones is the chief agricultural officer.[7]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nGeorge Burquest of Seattle University's student publication The Spectator gave the white meat chicken sandwich a rating of 7 out of 10 and wrote, \"All in all, Mt. Joy was a very pleasant experience, but nothing to write home about. The sandwich looked like a dictionary definition ... and the flavors were by book as well.\"[4]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nFood portal\n\nChicken sandwich wars\n\nFried chicken restaurant\n\nList of chicken restaurants\n\nList of food trucks\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",
