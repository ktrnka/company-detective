      "# [98point6 Technologies on 2024-03-08](https://www.98point6.com/platform/)\nAsynchronous care, or âasync,â is a type of virtual care with no scheduling requirements, giving the patient the flexibility and convenience to seek care for non-urgent concerns whenever and wherever theyâd like. Whereas a response from a provider may occur quickly, there is no real-time interaction between the patient and the medical staff. This type of dedicated care also helps with capturing revenue by incorporating patient messages from a provider’s inbox back into the patient chart to enhance the continuity of care. 98point6 can support your clinicians in asynchronously diagnosing and treating more than 140 common conditions for patients across all agesâfrom pediatrics to geriatrics.\n\nOur AI-powered solution leverages evidence-based clinical content, machine learning, and automation to recommend the optimal care option, while also giving patients the ability to choose the format they prefer. Customizable to the specific workflow of the healthcare organization, the clinician can direct the patient to real-time care or prompt them to seek in-person care if their medical concern cannot be treated asynchronously.\n\nReal-time virtual care can consist of text-based messaging, audio, or video interactions, or any combination of the three. Additionally, real-time care can be facilitated as an on-demand or scheduled visit. On-demand visits allow patients to immediately start a visit, any time, from anywhere. Patients can report symptoms and concerns and our product gathers relevant history, before connecting the patient to a clinician. Wait times in the queue are dependent on clinician availability. ScheduledÂ visits allow patients to choose a date and time in the future that is most convenient for them.\n\nOur patient intake automates much of the administrative tasks associated with taking a history. Our product is trained, based on millions of patient encounters, to respond to patient-reported symptoms with question sets, written by physicians, that elicit relevant clinical details for provider review. It works like this: the patient enters their chief complaint as free text. They can write as much or as little as they want to communicate the reason for their visit and their symptoms. The 98point6 platform intakes all of that information and then generates the appropriate follow-up questions.\n\nOur patient intake process significantly reduces the administrative burden on clinicians – and automatically captures an accurate transcript of patient-reported symptoms.\n\nWe have been applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to medical encounters since 2015. As a result, we have a vast data set that is one-of-a-kind in the field of natural language processing for medical applications. We utilize Al and machine learning to improve both efficiency and medical quality by automating time-consuming tasks, allowing clinicians to focus their judgment on key decision points in the clinical encounter. Our system provides information and actions for the clinician to consider; however, the clinician is in complete control of the visit diagnosis, and care planning.\n\nData integration is cornerstone to the 98point6 platform. EMR data can be automatically pulled into the clinician console, and once the visit is complete, data is automatically sent to the EMR to be recorded in the patient’s medical record. Our standards-based integration supports Epic and Cerner, as well as other EMRs. The platform also supports data integrations for analytics, reporting, security and compliance and other administrative needs.",

This intelligence engine empowers our system to efficiently prioritize case assignments and equip clinical care teams with instant, one-click text-based options during patient interactions.\n\nBecause of our extensive history with AI, we have a vast data set that is one-of-a-kind in the field of natural language processing for medical applications â and these learnings are a key component to our software.",

As part of the deal, hundreds of 98point6 enterprise customers including Boeing, Kindercare and Banner|Aetna employing millions of eligible members will have access to an even wider selection of primary and behavioral health services through Transcarent.

      "# [The Doctor Will See You Right Now: 98point6 Introduces On-Demand Primary Care with Digital Platform Launch on 2018-05-01](https://www.98point6.com/press_release/the-doctor-will-see-you-right-now/)\n98point6 combines AI with board-certified physicians to provide primary care anytime, anywhere\n\nSEATTLE â May 1, 2018 âÂ 98point6Â today announced the launch of its on-demand primary care service to deliver personalized consultation, diagnosis and treatment to patients across the country. The service enables primary care beyond whatâs ever been possible, combining innovative AI technology with board-certified physicians to deliver affordable and high-quality care right to a patientâs smartphone. 98point6 physicians are currently seeing patients in 10 states: California, Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington. 98point6 will roll out the service to patients in all 50 states and Washington D.C. by the end of 2018, reinventing primary care coast to coast.\n\nPrimary care is a necessity for all, serving as the front line for healthcare and disease prevention. However, seeing a doctor is increasingly difficult with an average wait time of 24 days just for an appointment. Coupled with rising medical costs, patients are left wondering whether they need the treatment enough to warrant the time and cost. These factors have led to patient disengagement, with more than 21 percent of adults not having a primary care physician, and are the driving forces behind 98point6 â for all the times you want to see a physician but canât.\n\nTo provide patients primary care anywhere and anytime, 98point6 leverages machine learning and automation, helping doctors optimize and complete tasks that donât require direct physician interaction, such as the initial gathering of information. Rather than having doctors ask administrative questions, gather patient history or chart information, 98point6âs AI technology does it for them. Patient profiles are automatically built and the 98point6 system learns from each visit, avoiding redundancy.\n\nFrom there, 98point6 board-certified physicians take over and engage with the patient via private and secure in-app messaging to diagnose, treat and answer any health-related questions, no matter how large, small, or embarrassing. Patients will then receive a personalized care plan detailing their diagnosis and treatment, including prescriptions and labs as needed.\n\nâThere are far too many people that arenât getting the primary care they need, and thatâs a problem. Our mission is to make primary care accessible and affordable, inspiring early and frequent use, leading to better overall health and material cost of care savings,â said Robbie Cape, CEO and co-founder of 98point6. âThe ubiquity of smartphones, combined with consumer expectations for simple, life-changing solutions underscores the opportunity for on-demand care.Â 98point6 meets consumers where they are through private, text-based primary care thatâs available when and where they need it.â\n\nNow, anyone 18 years and older â whether they have health insurance or not â can download the 98point6 app and receive unlimited access to primary care for 12 months for a one-time introductory fee of $20. Thatâs a full year of primary care services for less than the cost of a typical copay.\n\nFor employers, 98point6 increases primary care utilization among those not actively or appropriately engaged in their healthcare. Employees can now access primary care in between meetings, during their commute or while getting ready in the morning. And similar to the consumer pricing model, 98point6 offers a low subscription fee for employers, resulting in little to no cost for employees while enabling earlier medical intervention and reducing overall cost of care.\n\nOne of the countryâs preeminent childrenâs hospitals, Seattle Childrenâs, recently became a 98point6 customer and will roll out the service to their employees later this month.\n\nâSeattle Childrenâs is committed to providing top quality care to those in need, and that includes the health and well-being of our highly valued team members,â said Myra Gregorian, Senior Vice President and Chief People Officer at Seattle Childrenâs. â98point6âs solution allows us to provide an additional layer of care that complements current healthcare plans and fits within our teamâs busy lifestyle.â\n\nTo begin using 98point6, download the app from theÂ Apple App StoreÂ orÂ Google Play, create a secure account, and the doctor will see you right now.\n\nFor additional information, please visitÂ www.98point6.com.\n\nAbout 98point6"

As a provider responsible for handling calls from subscribed employees, it is crucial that her professionalism and respect reflect the value of the service that employers pay for. The purpose of this service is to provide employees with prompt and convenient care, and it is essential that her behavior aligns with this objective.\n\nUnfortunately, my experience with Nurse  was far from satisfactory. After expressing a differing opinion, she abruptly terminated the visit, displaying a lack of professionalism and cowardice.

For example: I have had a sore throat for almost 2 weeks now and can never get to the doctors office because they work the same hours I do… I told the doctor my symptoms and told him that I have been taking antihistamines and nasal spray that have been working but my throat is still killing me; he proceeded to prescribe me the same antihistamines and nasal spray that I had already been taking none of which would help my throat whatsoever… It also takes a good 30-45 minutes to finish your appointment because it’s ALL texting.

I told the doctor my issue and asked if it were possible for a script (nothing with painkillers or anything they aren’t allowed to prescribe), to which the doctor essentially ignored me and recommended things I have been doing to no avail throughout being sick. I informed the doctor that his advice was not something that was working, however I would give one of his solutions a try (it was clear he had no interest in helping me, as my primary care would have) and wrapped up the conversation asap.

With that being said, I had to do a video call with the doctor for my visit before she would start evaluating my issue. It was probably 5 or 10 seconds, nothing long, and then we began texting. I honestly wish we had just finished the visit through the video chat since we had to do it in the beginning anyway. I ended up having to type out long responses while tending to my infant son and trying to get ready for work at the same time. It ended up taking a lot longer than I had anticipated to create all these replies to all the questions she asked. If we already had to do the video chat, I wish we could have just finished the entire visit that way. \n\nSecond, the reason for my call was an earache. I woke up that morning with my ear killing me. I did a visit on this app and the doctor said to get Flonase and Sudafed and that should help. I asked about antibiotic ear drops and didn’t get any. I realize that my doctor couldn’t actually examine my ear so she couldn’t tell whether or not it was an infection, but honestly what would have been the harm in just giving me some ear drops? I dealt with the problem for 3 more months trying to get the issue to go away with Flonase and Sudafed before I woke up with a stabbing pain in my ear and went to my PCP, and as it turns out I’ve had an ear infection for the past 3 months. I understand not wanting to prescribe antibiotics unnecessarily but if have zero complaints about sinus issues, no drainage, doesn’t hurt on the outer ear, and it’s been going on for several weeks, what would have been the harm in some antibiotic ear drops? I don’t think there would have been any harm. \n\nThis format just isn’t effective and feels rushed, like you have to stop whatever you’re doing to reply so that you aren’t keeping the visit from ending. It sounds like it would be conducive to a busy lifestyle but I didn’t find it effective. And the care seems to be subpar. A coworker of mine had a visit the day after mine and she had a sinus infection. The doctor on the app didn’t give her antibiotics either. What do they have against antibiotics?!",

The first two visits were really good.  I would have highly recommended. Then the last two visits happened. I not only will no longer use this but I’m going share with everyone I know not to use! Both visits all the Doctors cared about was COVID and pushing the COVID vaccination. We understand being concerned with COVID but not everything is COVID! And when they are told you already tested negative and they continue only talking about COVID. That’s unacceptable! Also no vaccination is supposed to be given to anyone who is sick. Adults, children, infants, the elderly.  It doesn’t matter and a medical doctor SHOULD KNOW THIS! They did nothing to help at either visit. And we mean nothing! They didn’t listen to any of the list of things that you answer before logging in. Anything said while chatting. Neither Doctor ever got on the video chat like they are supposed to do. Oh and the wait times were way longer then estimated. So if you want no help, to waste your money, and to waste an hour or more off your day then this is perfect! Seems like a great idea to get seen without going to a hospital, urgent care ,etc. or your primary can’t get you in and you don’t have to risk catching something else. BUT they do nothing to actually treat you. After both visits we had the family members taken to our local urgent care and both times they needed medical treatment and or medication.  Medication that should have and could have been given through the doctors on this app. Also 98.6 sends you emails asking how you’re visit went. Both times the surveys were answered with the truth and how bad the service was. Do you think we heard anything back?

Won’t prescribe., 1 stars [(Jfkvkek dmckwns, Apple App Store, 2020-12-29)](https://apple/6807572935)\nGot this app for a quick prescription for a yeast infection without urgent care fees or time spent on an appointment. Tried 3 different docs. All of them told me to see someone in person or get labs done first??? I’m a female I know what a yeast infection feels like. Honestly this app is just an advertisement for LabCorp/Quest who they’re obviously partnered with because they tried to make me pay for labs or appointments with them every time. I found other apps who will write a simple antifungal rx without forcing labs and appointments down my throat (WHICH NEGATES THE PURPOSE OF MOBILE CARE). Don’t waste your money on this scam.",

Unfortunately, I have been experiencing symptoms that lead me to suspect I may have contracted strep throat, although I cannot be entirely certain. In an attempt to seek medical advice conveniently, I decided to utilize the 98.6 app, a service provided by our employer. Previously, we had been using Teldoc for the past 20 years, but our employer recently switched to 98.6, which has proven to be an inconvenience and a waste of time, with no added convenience.\n\nDuring my recent interaction with the 98.6 app, I had the opportunity to consult with the FNP-BC, a Nurse Practitioner based in New York, NY. As a provider responsible for handling calls from subscribed employees, it is crucial that her professionalism and respect reflect the value of the service that employers pay for. The purpose of this service is to provide employees with prompt and convenient care, and it is essential that her behavior aligns with this objective.\n\nUnfortunately, my experience with Nurse  was far from satisfactory. After expressing a differing opinion, she abruptly terminated the visit, displaying a lack of professionalism and cowardice.

Also, from my experience the physicians are not well qualified and don’t take your symptoms into consideration whatsoever. For example: I have had a sore throat for almost 2 weeks now and can never get to the doctors office because they work the same hours I do… I told the doctor my symptoms and told him that I have been taking antihistamines and nasal spray that have been working but my throat is still killing me; he proceeded to prescribe me the same antihistamines and nasal spray that I had already been taking none of which would help my throat whatsoever… It also takes a good 30-45 minutes to finish your appointment because it’s ALL texting.

Update to first review; two days later - I’ve followed her recommendations and used all the OTC products and I’m still sick - zero improvement, some deterioration. I understand some people abuse antibiotics- but this doctor didn’t even talk to me other than to verify my name and birthday. If she had taken the time to speak with me over the zoom, she could have ascertained that I do in fact have a bacterial infection. Instead, she texted a very general, “one size fits all” recommendation. I think it’s a waste of money for business to use this service for their employees.

Let me just say that this is where technology draws the line - getting healthcare over text (which is their primary communication method) seems ineffective. For a start, the amount of intake questions they ask you before you’re connected to an actual provider is insane. I quit the app on multiple occasions because I was annoyed at answering the questions. Another thing is there are limited situations that would warrant discussing a medical issue over text.

I told the doctor my issue and asked if it were possible for a script (nothing with painkillers or anything they aren’t allowed to prescribe), to which the doctor essentially ignored me and recommended things I have been doing to no avail throughout being sick. I informed the doctor that his advice was not something that was working, however I would give one of his solutions a try (it was clear he had no interest in helping me, as my primary care would have) and wrapped up the conversation asap.

With that being said, I had to do a video call with the doctor for my visit before she would start evaluating my issue. It was probably 5 or 10 seconds, nothing long, and then we began texting. I honestly wish we had just finished the visit through the video chat since we had to do it in the beginning anyway. I ended up having to type out long responses while tending to my infant son and trying to get ready for work at the same time. It ended up taking a lot longer than I had anticipated to create all these replies to all the questions she asked. If we already had to do the video chat, I wish we could have just finished the entire visit that way. \n\nSecond, the reason for my call was an earache. I woke up that morning with my ear killing me. I did a visit on this app and the doctor said to get Flonase and Sudafed and that should help. I asked about antibiotic ear drops and didn’t get any. I realize that my doctor couldn’t actually examine my ear so she couldn’t tell whether or not it was an infection, but honestly what would have been the harm in just giving me some ear drops? I dealt with the problem for 3 more months trying to get the issue to go away with Flonase and Sudafed before I woke up with a stabbing pain in my ear and went to my PCP, and as it turns out I’ve had an ear infection for the past 3 months. I understand not wanting to prescribe antibiotics unnecessarily but if have zero complaints about sinus issues, no drainage, doesn’t hurt on the outer ear, and it’s been going on for several weeks, what would have been the harm in some antibiotic ear drops? I don’t think there would have been any harm. \n\nThis format just isn’t effective and feels rushed, like you have to stop whatever you’re doing to reply so that you aren’t keeping the visit from ending. It sounds like it would be conducive to a busy lifestyle but I didn’t find it effective. And the care seems to be subpar. A coworker of mine had a visit the day after mine and she had a sinus infection. The doctor on the app didn’t give her antibiotics either. What do they have against antibiotics?!",

      "# Do not recommend!!!!, 1 stars [(bobbyemc, Apple App Store, 2021-05-03)](https://apple/7295542298)\nOur insurance signed my family up for this during the pandemic. The first two visits were really good.  I would have highly recommended. Then the last two visits happened. I not only will no longer use this but I’m going share with everyone I know not to use! Both visits all the Doctors cared about was COVID and pushing the COVID vaccination. We understand being concerned with COVID but not everything is COVID! And when they are told you already tested negative and they continue only talking about COVID. That’s unacceptable! Also no vaccination is supposed to be given to anyone who is sick. Adults, children, infants, the elderly.  It doesn’t matter and a medical doctor SHOULD KNOW THIS! They did nothing to help at either visit. And we mean nothing! They didn’t listen to any of the list of things that you answer before logging in. Anything said while chatting. Neither Doctor ever got on the video chat like they are supposed to do. Oh and the wait times were way longer then estimated. So if you want no help, to waste your money, and to waste an hour or more off your day then this is perfect! Seems like a great idea to get seen without going to a hospital, urgent care ,etc. or your primary can’t get you in and you don’t have to risk catching something else. BUT they do nothing to actually treat you. After both visits we had the family members taken to our local urgent care and both times they needed medical treatment and or medication.  Medication that should have and could have been given through the doctors on this app. Also 98.6 sends you emails asking how you’re visit went. Both times the surveys were answered with the truth and how bad the service was. Do you think we heard anything back? NOPE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! \n\nSo This review is being written and we hope that it will be a cautionary tale about this app and what to expect.",

      "# Post ID bg7ip2: Internet medicine is awesome, 98point6 was so so helpful for me with +57 score by [(FrugalChef13, Reddit, 2019-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/)\n**TL;DR- $20 got me an awesome appointment with a nice doctor and a prescription for a medication I could afford that solved my issue.**\n\n*Disclaimer: This particular thing worked well for me so I'm going to tell you about it. Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I'm not compensated or connected to the website I'm discussing.*\n\nSo like a lot of people on here I'm usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it's underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I've got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I'd run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn't been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn't, it's weird.\n\nSo I was fucked.  Can't sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can't afford the $100+ for a doctor's appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there's a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\n\nSo I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It's $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I'm drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I'm still in bad shape tomorrow morning it's worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\n\nGuys, it was amazing.  It's not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I'd already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn't help.  She was so kind, and didn't make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor's appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it's faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can't prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I'd taken in the past wasn't an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What's the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\n\nUsually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it's what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you'll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can't estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\n\nThis amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I'll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn't shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that's a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\n\nI would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It's not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it's a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\n\nIf anyone else has recommendations or critiques or thoughts on internet medicine stuff I'd love to hear it.\n\n## Comment ID elj1h0o with +9 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/elj1h0o/) (in reply to ID bg7ip2):\nThat sounds like a great resource!

Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.\n\nA prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\n\nControlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\n\nSo the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.  Neither medication can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor, but Vicodin is super extra hard to get prescribed.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nEDIT: I tried to clarify the original post to make it more obvious that although she couldn't prescribe the thing I'd taken in the past, she did prescribe a thing that helped a lot.  It actually helped even more than the thing I'd taken in the past and without making me drowsy, which is AWESOME!\n\n#### Comment ID elkh6df with +3 score by [(Mr_Fuzzo, Reddit, 2019-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/elkh6df/) (in reply to ID eljx9uw):\nControlled substances, for the un-initiated are medications like opiates, barbiturates, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, etc.\n\nSo, meds like Xanax, OxyContin, Ritalin, etc.\n\n#### Comment ID eljy54o with +2 score by [(AnotherDay_RS, Reddit, 2019-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/eljy54o/) (in reply to ID eljx9uw):\nThat's great!!

      "# Post ID 1ecm7g6: Calling Sick with +25 score by [(ElderberryPrior1658, Reddit, 2024-07-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/boeing/comments/1ecm7g6/calling_sick/)\nIm still in the FTC, fresh out of the military so I have 0 life experience. How does calling out sick work? I’ve been told you need a doctors note. But if I was sick and still healthy enough to drive I’d just show up to work. I’ve got a raging fever and can barely move. How am I supposed to go to the clinic for a note? Is there any way around it?\n\nAnd a separate issue. As part of having no civilian life experience, how do you know where to go for the note? I haven’t set up a primary care yet but I’ve set up the insurance. Would I just go to urgent care?\n\n___\n\n\nEDIT: thanks for all the help everyone. I’ve got sick hours to cover it. I also called a steward to verify what y’all said about the note so I can cover my ass. I’ll be sure to let my colleagues know that the sick slip is only if u have no hours to cover it:\n\nAnd to the small handful of weirdos in the comments. I’m not risking a wreck driving in while I’m puking my guts out. If I was healthy enough to drive I woulda gone in. I’ve always wanted to work for Boeing since I was a kid, as my childhood dream, and I still don’t boot lick as bad as y’all. \n\n## Comment ID lf0tolo with +11 score by [(Jayden_Ebi, Reddit, 2024-07-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/boeing/comments/1ecm7g6/calling_sick/lf0tolo/) (in reply to ID 1ecm7g6):\nYou don't need a doctor's note to use your sick leave. just call the hotline and put in 8 hours of sick leave in your ETS the next day\n\n## Comment ID lf19kr0 with +10 score by [(PlayfulOtterFriend, Reddit, 2024-07-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/boeing/comments/1ecm7g6/calling_sick/lf19kr0/) (in reply to ID 1ecm7g6):\nI know Boeing is big with several different attendance policies, which range by region, division, job role, and union status.

If you're not spending much each year, it's your best option. If you're worried about catastrophic scenarios, the HSA does have a maximum out-of-pocket of $6,500, so you won't have to pay more than that in any given year. The only reason you might look at the other plans is if you fall somewhere in between.\n\nAs for your concern about \"too good to be true\", the reality is that for the company, it's still the cheapest option even with the annual HSA contribution since few will hit that maximum unless there is a catastrophic health event.

Choosing the hsa puts me in a mindset where Im essentially thinking ok, paying out of pocket ( let's say OoP to keep the Boeing acronym thing going haha) , it's gonna be like $300 ish per doc visit which, is going to be a huge incentive to just NEVER GO, \n\nThe help desk lady I cled did say we can use that $1200 towards the deductible though, so essentially we get 2-3 \"free aka funded\" doc visits per year ..\n\nBut like, how are we supposed to bet we won't have any catastrophic health episodes ?

Making sure that you put that premium savings into the HSA via paycheck contributions and use it to pay for medical expenses, you'll at least break even with the Traditional plans.\n\nHIgh deductible health plans save companies money because people mentally don't consider annual healthcare expenses to be a sunk cost and will forego care because they are scared of the first couple bills before they meet their deductible when in reality if they had other plans that money would be spent on premiums regardless of their healthcare needs.\n\nThere is advice out there not to choose a HDHP if one is having a baby that year or anticipates a lot of healthcare expenses, but that is actually not generally the thing to do based on how Boeing prices the plans.",

Mostly because a lot of those people were more harmed by meds than helped. Also they don't work well for so many ( especially for depression). SSRI and other antidepressants triggered first manic symptoms for some. So I understand why some don't trust treatment after. Side effects can be terrible and often people suffer from them too long without acting on it because they blindly follow their psychiatrist not listening to their body. Some are deeply dangerous for a minority and considered lifesaving for the majority. But you don't know where you'll be. Metabolic effects of many meds aren't taken seriously enough. Trading diabetes for smaller depression, isn't great. Others saw close relatives getting worse on meds than before. For others it's the stigmatization associated with taking psych med. Others were pressured by family or laws and were traumatized. Others because of spiritual belief or because they hate big pharma. What I personally hate bout medication isn't the drugs itself but the lack of a real consent. People received meds without knowing why, the risk involved and not only short term risk. They didn't know that most of them create dependence or for some like benzo and stimulant, addiction. I know pharmacology isn't interesting to everyone. But some basic information should be told and not only received a  pharmaceutical monograph hard to read. I personally choose to use meds as I don't find anything wrong about using drugs to help me. I truly think doctors sincerely want to help their patients with the limited half working tools they got. But I don't like how new expansive medication with poor data on efficiency and safety are often pushed instead of older ones.\n\n## Comment ID l8256gy with +4 score by [(Suitable-Vehicle8331, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1dcx6q4/why_dont_some_people_want_meds/l8256gy/) (in reply to ID 1dcx6q4):\nMy husband heard his parents get in a fight one time and his dad screamed at his mom “why don’t you go take your crazy pills.”  \n\nThere’s more I could say about it, but I think it’s enough to know there are people who have somebody screaming “go take your crazy pills” during fights.\n\n### Comment ID l88l1bk with +2 score by [(imalrightifuralright, Reddit, 2024-06-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1dcx6q4/why_dont_some_people_want_meds/l88l1bk/) (in reply to ID l8256gy):\nMy sister said this to me one time during an argument.

Through the correct types of therapy with the right therapists you can improve significantly. I did a lot of therapy and I was willing to do the work! And I did, again and again. When I didn’t know it was bipolar I didn’t know that I needed meds to get that part of me better.\n\nAlso- some people are very sensitive to meds and get rare and unusual side effects (also me!). After many years I found the right psychiatrist who was willing to put me on just 150mg/day of lithium- the lowest dose, so low that it doesn’t even show up on my blood tests! And yet, it has worked for me and has improved my mood episodes. I like that it also repairs the damage that bipolar does to the brain.\n\nBefore, I saw psychiatrists who insisted I stay on meds that made me so sick that I couldn’t function. Of course I didn’t want that! Who would? When the side effects are worse than the treatment no one would want to take meds. I’m persistent thankfully and I kept trying, but it’s been so many years of trying different things and having so many things not work out or actively make things worse.\n\nAnd- my family is anti-meds. My dad took an anti-depressant which made him manic (didn’t know it was mania at the time) and told me the horror stories. And when I was put on Wellbutrin I had a horrible time with it, not even an SSRI. If I had taken an SSRI there’s no doubt that I’d have a full manic episode like my dad.

It was entirely my choice to go on meds again a couple years ago, and it being my choice made a world of difference and has actually helped.\n\nI was forced onto adhd meds of all things when I was 13, and already has a bipolar diagnosis. Wtf the psychiatrist was thinking, I have no idea. It was absolutely hellish. Didn't eat or sleep, dropped from 140 to 125 pounds in a month, and had meltdowns frequently.\n\nThen they actually put me on mood stabilizers, and the kind they gave me didn't work well for me either, but I was forced to stay on them anyway.\n\nOne of them was Abilify. I tried it again as an adult, and it caused one of the worst manic episodes I've ever had. I was on it for years as a teen, and it makes we wonder how many of my \"behavioral issues\" were caused by it. \n\nI also was forced to take Wellbutrin as a teen, and it made me feel horrible from the get-go, but it wasn't until it gave me rage issues and therefore became a concern for OTHER people that they took me off of it. \n\nShortly before my 21st birthday, I had been unmedicated for about four years and !>attempted suicide<! after a breakup. At that point, I went into a psych ward for five days or so and was put on a combination of Lithium and Cymbalta, despite my genetic predisposition for thyroid issues (a risk of Lithium). Apparently this combo is only meant to be used short-term because it's so intense, but I was on it for about a year. I did end up with hypothyroidism from it and will have to take medication for the rest of my life.\n\nI have severe PTSD from going through the troubled teen industry from ages 15 to 17. I was already having symptoms before I was put on the Lithium/Cymbalta combo, but that was my first time being medicated as an adult, and for whatever reason, it ramped up the PTSD symptoms ten-fold. I didn't have any support (couldn't afford therapy), and I couldn't handle it on my own. The flashbacks were damn near constant, and the nightmares had me waking up screaming literally every night. \n\nIt was all over when I discovered that weed makes all of that stop, especially since it makes you not dream, and therefore stopped the nightmares. I smoked so much in 2016 and early 2017 that it put me into a state of severe psychosis (as it can do for us bipolar folks, as a word of warning to you all), and I ended up going into an outpatient program for addiction and PTSD. It took MONTHS for my psychotic symptoms to go away. Thank God my parents bailed me out by getting me into treatment, or I genuinely don't think I would still be here. \n\nWhile I was in the treatment program, I tapered down my meds and went off of them entirely. I adamantly refused to take any others either. I remained unmedicated until summer 2022. \n\nAt that point, manic episodes (which I didn't recognize as manic episodes at the time) had been destroying my friendships and romantic relationships left and right for about a year or two. I was also angry a lot of the time and other times would have complete meltdowns sobbing on the floor over small things. \n\nIt was then that I finally, truly accepted my bipolar diagnosis. I had been diagnosed three times (ages 13, 20, and 22), but I had convinced myself that the diagnosis was wrong and that my extreme reactions to the world around me were normal. I tried medication one more time. I was absolutely terrified going into it because of my past experiences, but it was the first time ever that it was MY CHOICE to try it. It made all the difference. \n\nI used the genome testing that the treatment center had done to determine which meds would be good candidates (my genome has a fuck ton of variations that make me respond in unexpected ways to nearly all psychiatric meds, hence the awful med reactions in the past), and did extensive research on potential benefits and side effects of all the potential meds before going to a psychiatrist and essentially saying \"I want to try this medication (Lamotrigine). Here are my reasons as well as my genome testing to back up my decision. Can you please prescribe this to me?\" They agreed that it was a good option, and prescribed it to me. \n\nWe've increased it only when I've asked and I've refused the addition of other meds that I don't want to take. It has worked because I'm really aware of my moods and have asked my partner to make me aware of the few things that I might miss. Being in control of my medication and what's being done to my brain has made me feel okay about taking medication. I'm stable for the first time in my whole life, and have been (save some milder breakthrough symptoms) for almost two years.\n\nThe PTSD did worsen for a while, but I was actually in therapy this time around and had/have a supportive partner and was able to handle it way better. Having gone through PTSD recovery therapy while at the treatment center made a huge difference too because I was able to handle the symptoms on my own most of the time. \n\nLong story short, I didn't want meds because I had absolutely horrific experiences when I was forced onto meds as a kid and again as a young adult, and I also didn't believe my diagnosis for a long time. But I'm on meds now and it has improved my life dramatically.\n\n## Comment ID l8368te with +2 score by [(miss_Snork, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1dcx6q4/why_dont_some_people_want_meds/l8368te/) (in reply to ID 1dcx6q4):\nBecause I don't want to be neither fat (neuroleptics) nor dumb (lamotrigine).\n\n## Comment ID l83ruqr with +2 score by [(iamthpecial, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1dcx6q4/why_dont_some_people_want_meds/l83ruqr/) (in reply to ID 1dcx6q4):\nSome meds I took for long gave me night sweats and night terrors on top of feeling like I was living in a waking nightmare for years. There is also the matter of, it almost feels as if some meds dull your thoughts deliberately so that you cannot think clearly enough to get to the point of being able to start planning to do yourself in. Brainfog some call it.\n\nTo me what sucks most about meds it that they restrict my ability to have totally free agency in the world, and I mean that in a concrete capacity, for instance if I wanted to volunteer on a conservation project in Africa, or do months-long hike through a country or continent—I would need to have meds sorted ahead of time, and in most cases at least so far they arent willing to offer you more than three months, my ADHD medicine even shorter, only one month max Rx. So you see, medicine can be frustrating if you are the kind of person who wants to trip around the world at leisure, because they will always and forever dictate and put a limit to where you go and how long you can stay. It cuts out a lot of adventure imo.\n\n## Comment ID l84ey6m with +2 score by [(cathoderituals, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1dcx6q4/why_dont_some_people_want_meds/l84ey6m/) (in reply to ID 1dcx6q4):\nSide-effects, past negative experiences with mental health professionals pre-dx, or feeling like meds are on some level suppressing parts of their personalities that they \\*do\\* like.\n\nI wasn't properly dx'ed until later in life, and my experiences with psychiatrists, therapists and medication in my teens and early-mid 20s is a big part of why I went so long without giving it another shot.\n\n## Comment ID l84z4y4 with +2 score by [(Goat_lord_79, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1dcx6q4/why_dont_some_people_want_meds/l84z4y4/) (in reply to ID 1dcx6q4):\nIt's not that I don't want meds it's that after a few decades of going through 20 plus different medications and neverending med tweaks and changes I personally still have never recently a positive benefit from medication. Consistent increases in symptoms or paradoxical reactions or bad side effects and no positive benefit. I'd gladly take a medication that helped me even with a few side effects but as far as I can tell after 32 years of this none of the current meds are able to help me. The last medication I tried was Latuda and after the side of effects from that never again will I agree to try a medication for the purpose of letting a Dr see if it might work. I'm tired of being a free med test essentially being on a neverending train of med changes. Again if anything actually worked I'd love to be better able to maintain stability and mood. Nothing ever has, not clean and sober, drinking or not drinking, using substances not using substances. If psych medications get used my what they now say is BI polar type 2 gets unbearably worse and I have to suffer more than if I'm not on meds. I have a medical cannabis prescription which helps me level out my anger and irritable mood but I'm not currently planning on any more medications since I was weaned off of Latuda and I was more stable and better able to control my temper and my body was in much less pain and had way fewer muscle spasms etc.  Honestly I think that this is my body telling me that I'm basically un-medicatable, which is actually a huge pain in the ass and requires that I specifically have to spend hours of my time talking with every new mental health related professional telling them \"I've been on that drug or drug combination, it doesn't work,\" and then I get to spend twice as long defending cannabis use and by like appointment 15 I basically get to a point where they try and tell me shock treatment is awesome, which I happen to know is a complete fabrication. \nThat's why for me. I won't ever tell someone else to not seek medical help or not take their meds, that's irresponsible and potentially fatal, but I have no good experience with being medicated myself. It's more something that I survived than was helped by.\n\n## Comment ID l84zv0v with +2 score by [(AllKyleNoSubstance, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1dcx6q4/why_dont_some_people_want_meds/l84zv0v/) (in reply to ID 1dcx6q4):\nPart of it for me is not believing like I deserve to be stable. I also have a fear of doctors and anxiety about going outside so getting a prescription and actually picking it is incredibly difficult for me, especially when I'm in an episode and need it the most\n\n## Comment ID l85aqhk with +2 score by [(SugarSecure655, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1dcx6q4/why_dont_some_people_want_meds/l85aqhk/) (in reply to ID 1dcx6q4):\nAs long as I can get by without them it's my choice.

Started lamictal recently and have no side effects as far as I can tell and it's pretty much transformed my life, mostly on the level of how my thoughts work. That in turn allows my mood to be better, with less depression. I feel like I bounce back now more normally, more like I did when I was a kid and early adolescence. \n\nHowever, before the lamictal, years ago I was taking lithium and an antipsychotic. The latter caused weight gain and both caused tiredness. I also felt they made me less cognitively sharp, so I wanted to get off them if possible. I eventually did and was just on antidepressants. I didn't like them either because I think they caused emotional blunting. And they probably made the bp2 worse. I'm still on the antidepressants for now but with the lamictal I feel much better. Maybe I'll eventually get off the antidepressants\n\n## Comment ID l8179te with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1dcx6q4/why_dont_some_people_want_meds/l8179te/) (in reply to ID 1dcx6q4):\nI’m with you 100%.

This is exacerbated if the individual has other MH comorbidities. For some I'd wager that the process just isn't worth it because nothing seems to work.\n\n3) I haven't experienced this at all, but it would seem a fair amount of people feel \"numb\" on medications. I was concerned about this when I was prescribed medication but my psychiatrist told me that this often happens with people who are overmedicated and/or have comorbidities that make it significantly more difficult to get the right cocktail in the correct dosages.\n\n4) One of the top reasons BP peeps stop taking their medication is because they are stable and feel good and doubt about their diagnosis creeps in...imposter syndrome...I was just being overly dramatic and I think I'm fine now. I've had these doubts and have been tempted, but then I just think about the very scary mixed episodes (how could those possibly be \"just being overly dramatic\" as well as my depressive episodes where I'd come home and just sit on the back patio and stare at the mountains while I drowned myself in beer and vodka, completely withdrawn from my wife and kids. \n\n5) I was diagnosed relatively recently at 49...most people with BP are diagnosed in their early to mid 20s...the idea of taking a medication for the rest of their lives can be daunting and disturbing at that age. For myself, I've been on blood pressure medication since I was in my mid 30s and cholesterol medication since my early 40s and I also take a medication to prevent gout flares which I started on 4 years ago. My mood stabilizer is just another pill at this point. \n\nI hope to get off of some of the other medications with proper a good diet and exercise (and losing some weight) which is a lot easier to stay consistent with now that I'm stable. I feel fortunate I guess that my only medication is lamotrigine and it has thus far worked very well and has been a godsend\n\n## Comment ID l87agab with +1 score by [(DryHair3101, Reddit, 2024-06-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1dcx6q4/why_dont_some_people_want_meds/l87agab/) (in reply to ID 1dcx6q4):\nThere a myriad of reasons but for me it's been either; They work well enough to where I forget how bad it was before them and therefore decide the side effects (which do, tbf, suck) are worse than what the symptoms of BP were. Or I have a depressive episode that leads me to forgetting to take my meds and in a not so sound mental state, I decide to just not take them for a while. Usually I retake them within a week bc the symptoms of BP just get too bad\n\n## Comment ID l87ipbc with +1 score by [(xXJulius23Xx, Reddit, 2024-06-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1dcx6q4/why_dont_some_people_want_meds/l87ipbc/) (in reply to ID 1dcx6q4):\nFor me some of the side effects were really weird in a way I am being a but of a baby about them but the fucking adhedonia or whatever sucked. It makes me shy away from dose increases.\n\nAnd the change for me *feeeels* like its not doing much.  Objectively I am doing much better, but I am more aware of my mood swings now, so I dont feel like Im getting better, so the meds feel pointless.\n\nI know I need them.

Then there were layoffs and more employees at all levels left on their own. Goals have not changed. More have been added and all dead lines were kept the same. Of course when these deadlines are not met the next company meeting is negative with a lot of general blaming and saying we all just need to work harder. Communication overall has been terrible with \"we don't know yet\" being the usual answer for any concerns. Weeks without answers. Any answers are just as rushed and poorly thought out as the changes. This toxic attitude is starting with the top level but you can see it affecting teams as they feel more pressure.",

In other words don’t just reply to Glassdoor reviews promising you’ll change but then doing the same thing. Let’s see some action. \r\n\r\n2. Implement change management best practices. Try to anticipate, listen to, and address concerns from employees about the upcoming changes. Allow people adequate time to process a change. Even when you’ve had time to process the change, remember that the news is still fresh for others and they may need more time to process and talk through concerns. Multiple events over the past few years had indicated that change management is not a strength that we have internally, so maybe it’s time to bring in some consultants who could assist with this culture shift.\r\n\r\n3. Prioritize your people. It hurts me to see how many people have had negative experiences at 98point6 and who have left since they felt they could not develop there or continue to succeed in such a psychologically unsafe culture. Sacrificing people to meet your financial goals will not work due to the expense of that turnover. Prioritize your people and the rest of the goals will follow.",

          "cons": "It’s taken a few months of reflection for me to process my experience at 98point6 since leaving and be able to summarize the numerous red flags into this one review. If you are considering a job there, please be aware that you are entering a culture that is extremely toxic to individual contributors. While 98point6 has a neat mission and some great people, it has some major cons that I’ve attempted to summarize below: \r\n\r\n1. Lack of Change Management\r\nAnnounces major leadership changes right before holiday weekends, when many are out of office. When they host AMAs, the leadership is defensive and not open to discourse. Little is done to support the employees struggling with the effects of the change.\r\n\r\n2. Minimal Development of Talent\r\nThere is a very slow performance review structure which is annual and takes ~3 months to complete. Even for a start-up they pay well below the market value, and the salary increases are minimal with little to no role/title development. This was particularly noticeable for those in coordinator roles.\r\n\r\n3. Incompetent Support for Employees\r\nThe COO does not have the competencies to direct the People Team to adequately support employees at this toxic company. When my team aimed to take the correct route and pull in the People Team for support, the People Team’s response was extremely slow and resulted in a solution that did more harm than good. I have heard similarly from many others in different departments, and other Glassdoor reviewers have reported this as well. \r\n\r\n4. Lack of Accountability for Management\r\nAt many times I heard comments from people managers that were sexist, racist, and downright disrespectful to others at the company. There is little accountability for those in management or leadership roles. The combination of this with an incompetent People Team results in a culture that is victim-blaming and generally unhealthy for individual contributors.\r\n\r\n5. Financial Instability Results in Deprioritzation of Employees\r\nTo meet our financial goals as a start up, the company implemented many measures which may have been financially wise but were extremely detrimental to employees. For example, in 2021 they entered a 6+ month hiring freeze which meant that even when a team lost multiple people they would not re-staff and instead would expect remaining team members to take on that work with no change in title or salary. Note that 98point6 refuses to make title or salary changes outside of the annual performance review even when this type of drastic change occurs. This has resulted in very high turnover (even when taking into account the “great resignation”) from those burnt out employees.\r\n\r\nTo summarize my experience at 98point6…Did I expand the scope of my role, take on new responsibilities, and learn new skills in the process? Absolutely! That’s what helped me land my next job.\r\n\r\nDid I receive any promotion, increase in formal recognition, other rewards or support at 98point6 as a result of my new responsibilities? Not at all. That’s what drove me to the realization that if I didn’t want my career trajectory to plateau I would need to pursue a job elsewhere.",

People across all departments leave 98point6 for ridiculous compensation increases. Similar to other reviews, it seems like HR refuses to listen to complaints or utilize data to improve known problems. Internal complaints go no where and annual merit increases are a joke. \r\n\r\nAbout a year into joining, everyone quickly realizes the pros of the company mission are far outweighed by the lack of compensation, tone deaf leadership, and huge work loads. There has been a max exodus from the company for the last couple months in addition to the CEO, CPO, and CTO all departing the company. It does seem like the writing is on the wall and employees are showing their feedback by departing the company since it seems to be the only way to be heard.",

Try to anticipate, listen to, and address concerns from employees about the upcoming changes. Allow people adequate time to process a change. Even when you’ve had time to process the change, remember that the news is still fresh for others and they may need more time to process and talk through concerns. Multiple events over the past few years had indicated that change management is not a strength that we have internally, so maybe it’s time to bring in some consultants who could assist with this culture shift.\r\n\r\n3. Prioritize your people. It hurts me to see how many people have had negative experiences at 98point6 and who have left since they felt they could not develop there or continue to succeed in such a psychologically unsafe culture.

        "cons": "It’s taken a few months of reflection for me to process my experience at 98point6 since leaving and be able to summarize the numerous red flags into this one review. If you are considering a job there, please be aware that you are entering a culture that is extremely toxic to individual contributors. While 98point6 has a neat mission and some great people, it has some major cons that I’ve attempted to summarize below: \r\n\r\n1. Lack of Change Management\r\nAnnounces major leadership changes right before holiday weekends, when many are out of office. When they host AMAs, the leadership is defensive and not open to discourse. Little is done to support the employees struggling with the effects of the change.\r\n\r\n2. Minimal Development of Talent\r\nThere is a very slow performance review structure which is annual and takes ~3 months to complete. Even for a start-up they pay well below the market value, and the salary increases are minimal with little to no role/title development. This was particularly noticeable for those in coordinator roles.\r\n\r\n3. Incompetent Support for Employees\r\nThe COO does not have the competencies to direct the People Team to adequately support employees at this toxic company. When my team aimed to take the correct route and pull in the People Team for support, the People Team’s response was extremely slow and resulted in a solution that did more harm than good. I have heard similarly from many others in different departments, and other Glassdoor reviewers have reported this as well. \r\n\r\n4. Lack of Accountability for Management\r\nAt many times I heard comments from people managers that were sexist, racist, and downright disrespectful to others at the company. There is little accountability for those in management or leadership roles. The combination of this with an incompetent People Team results in a culture that is victim-blaming and generally unhealthy for individual contributors.\r\n\r\n5. Financial Instability Results in Deprioritzation of Employees\r\nTo meet our financial goals as a start up, the company implemented many measures which may have been financially wise but were extremely detrimental to employees. For example, in 2021 they entered a 6+ month hiring freeze which meant that even when a team lost multiple people they would not re-staff and instead would expect remaining team members to take on that work with no change in title or salary. Note that 98point6 refuses to make title or salary changes outside of the annual performance review even when this type of drastic change occurs. This has resulted in very high turnover (even when taking into account the “great resignation”) from those burnt out employees.\r\n\r\nTo summarize my experience at 98point6…Did I expand the scope of my role, take on new responsibilities, and learn new skills in the process? Absolutely! That’s what helped me land my next job.\r\n\r\nDid I receive any promotion, increase in formal recognition, other rewards or support at 98point6 as a result of my new responsibilities? Not at all. That’s what drove me to the realization that if I didn’t want my career trajectory to plateau I would need to pursue a job elsewhere.",

      "# [98point6 Technologies Announces the Acquisition of Bright.md to Accelerate the Launch of its Asynchronous Care Module on 2024-01-16](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/98point6-technologies-announces-the-acquisition-of-brightmd-to-accelerate-the-launch-of-its-asynchronous-care-module-302034295.html)\nNew Module to Offer More Robust Integrated Virtual Care Delivery Options\n\nSEATTLE, Jan. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- 98point6 Technologies, a leader in licensed on-demand virtual care software, announced the addition of a new asynchronous module to its flagship technology, allowing providers the option of delivering both live and asynchronous care capabilities. By enabling healthcare organizations to license this additional model of care delivery, 98point6 once again sets the bar with an integrated, purpose-built clinician solution that future-proofs virtual clinic operations. In related news, the company announced it has doubled-down on its growth strategy, acquiring the remaining assets of Bright.md following the sale of its technology to Evernorth, and continuing to service long-time customers Baptist Health, UAB Medicine and 14 others.\n\nThe Balancing Act: Addressing Clinician Burnout and Patient Preferences\n\nClinician burnout is rampant, with over 45% of healthcare workers feeling burnout often or very often. Meanwhile, patients are embracing digital solutions: 64% want to receive some, most, or all of their health care virtually or online in the future. By giving providers the flexibility to support multiple modes of digitally communicating with patients based on their lifestyle and care preferences, 98point6's asynchronous virtual care module helps mitigate clinician burnout while enhancing the patient experience.\n\n\"In more than two years on the platform, Bright.md exceeded our high expectations for an asynchronous digital health partner,\" said Brett Oliver, MD, Chief Medical Information Officer at Baptist Health. \"As our patient and clinician needs evolve, we look forward to establishing a new partnership with 98point6 Technologies to extend our patient offerings, drive operational efficiencies and further advance our mission of providing innovative, quality care to the people of Kentucky and southern Indiana.\"\n\nAsynchronous care delivery represents the next service offering for 98point6 and a commitment to growth since launching as a licensed software provider last year. The async software offering enables providers to respond when their schedule allows, backed by a solution that takes clinical decision support to the next level. The robust technology deploys machine learning models to establish an intelligent engine that supports providers with intake, diagnosis, and care documentation. Developed by a team with a proven track record of building and managing a successful nationwide virtual clinic serving millions of patients, the module paves the way for further innovations.\n\n\"Our mission at 98point6 is to build market leading technology that empowers healthcare providers with the tools they need to broaden access, enhance patient engagement, and achieve cost savings through greater provider efficiency,\" said Jay Burrell, CEO of 98point6 Technologies. \"With the Bright.md acquisition we are dramatically accelerating our efforts to offer a robust, multi-functional virtual care software platform and it's a tremendous opportunity to engage with these 16 innovative health systems.\"\n\nFor more information on the new asynchronous offering, visit 98point6.com.\n\nAbout 98point6 Technologies\n\n98point6 Technologies builds and licenses software to power exceptional virtual care experiences for providers and patients based on years of clinical use across millions of patients. Its flagship 98point6 Technology Platform consists of turnkey, cloud-based software that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence bundled with time-tested, automated practice standards and electronic health record (EHR) integration.

      "# [98point6 buys asynchronous telehealth company Bright.md’s remaining assets by Emily Olsen, Rebecca Pifer on 2024-01-17](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/98point6-buys-bright-md-assets/704661/)\nDive Brief:\n\n98point6 Technologies purchased the remainder of asynchronous telehealth provider Bright.md’s assets for an undisclosed sum, the virtual care software firm said on Tuesday.\n\nThe deal, a split of 45% cash and 55% equity, includes Bright.md’s commercial assets, including 16 customer contracts as well as the firm’s sales and customer success teams, a spokesperson told Healthcare Dive.\n\nThe acquisition comes months after Bright.md’s technology was scooped up by Evernorth, insurer Cigna’s health services division.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMerger and acquisition activity among healthcare technology companies could heat up in 2024 as venture capital funding declines and buyers look for more integrated product offerings, experts told Healthcare Dive.\n\nDigital health funding last year fell to the lowest level seen since 2019, according to a report by venture capital firm and consultancy Rock Health.\n\nStartups were able to raise funds from existing investors, bring in extensions to previous raises and scoop up unlabeled funding to stay afloat in 2023 — but those tactics likely won’t continue this year, paving the way for increased M&A.\n\nFounded in 2015, Seattle-based 98point6 recently pivoted away from care delivery to focus on licensing its telehealth software to providers. In the spring, the company sold its self-insured employer business, affiliated physician group and a software license to Transcarent in a deal worth up to $100 million.\n\nThe Bright.md purchase will help 98point6 offer asynchronous telehealth, which allows providers and patients to send messages and respond to questions when they’re available, instead of relying on a real-time virtual visit.",

Together, these leaders will provide an all-in-one virtual care offering to healthcare organizations that combines 98point6’s cloud-based, licensable technology with SteadyMD’s 50-state network of highly-trained clinicians to help short staffed healthcare organizations lower the unit economic cost of care operations, reduce provider burnout and manage escalating patient workloads.\n\nWith an estimated shortage of 200,000 nurses and 50,000 physicians over the next three years and with more than 50% of U.S. hospitals operating at a deficit in 2022, health systems face significant financial and operational challenges. The text-first 98point6 Technology Platform, coupled with SteadyMD’s technology, clinical operations and clinician workforce, will enable organizations, such as health systems with in-person care, to create new revenue streams, increase provider efficiency and reduce administrative burdens — making their hybrid and virtual care strategies a reality.\n\n“98point6 Technologies brings a keen understanding of how technology can lower the cost of care while also providing the best patient and provider experiences possible,” said Guy Friedman, co-founder and CEO of SteadyMD. “Our new all-in-one virtual care solution promises to revolutionize healthcare delivery, ensuring providers have the tools and support they need to provide accessible, high-quality patient care.”\n\nThe 98point6 Technology Platform provides the backend infrastructure that enables healthcare organizations to innovate and quickly reimagine new economic models at scale.

Automation built into the platform limits care variability, optimizes patient and provider time by streamlining the intake process and reduces cognitive load on clinicians so they can more effectively and efficiently practice at the top of their license.\n\nThe SteadyMD clinicians work shoulder to shoulder with a client success team and clinical operations team to deliver effective and efficient clinical care. Through careful planning and monitoring, the team ensures that patients are seen in a timely manner, programs are staffed effectively, and clinicians are trained and confident in their use of the technology platform and their knowledge of customer and use case-tailored clinical protocols.\n\nThe 98point6 and SteadyMD offering to healthcare organizations includes:\n\nA digital clinic hosted in the cloud that seamlessly integrates with existing systems including EHRs, and is secure and compliant (HIPAA, SOC 2)\n\nAn AI-enhanced patient entry point that can be white-labeled with a healthcare organization’s brand\n\nA Clinician Console with configurable workflows, automated clinical decision support tools, support for multi-patient chat, and care follow-up and documentation tools\n\nTraining and development for clinicians and staff\n\nA 50-state network of clinicians, a client success team and a clinical ops team delivering on-demand and scheduled virtual care\n\n“Together with SteadyMD, we’re paving new ground by equipping strained healthcare organizations with the tools they need to navigate the complexities of today’s healthcare environment,” said Jay Burrell, President and Chief Executive Officer of 98point6 Technologies. “At 98point6, we believe in being more than a digital health solution; we’re a helping hand in transforming the healthcare landscape.

What Is This Notice?\n\nThis Notice describes how medical information about you may be used and disclosed and how you can get access to this information. Throughout this Notice, we may refer to your medical information as Protected Health Information, or “PHI.” To be clear, your PHI includes information about your health and health care (such as medical records), your personal identifiers (such as your name, phone number, address, and geolocation during a visit with The Transcarent Clinic), and your billing and payment information when you receive care from The Transcarent Clinic. Please read this notice carefully.\n\nII. Our Responsibilities\n\nThe Transcarent Clinic is committed to protecting patient PHI and compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”).

Our Uses and Disclosures of Your PHI\n\nUses and Disclosures Related to Your Care\n\nThe following is a list of reasons why The Transcarent Clinic can use or disclose your PHI without first obtaining your permission.\n\n1. Treatment. We may use or disclose your PHI to provide you with medical treatment and related services or to help manage the health care treatment you receive. We may use or disclose your PHI with other professionals who are treating you. If we receive from a substance abuse treatment provider information about your treatment, we may redisclose that information as permitted by the HIPAA Rules, unless you instruct us not to.\n\nExample: A clinician treating you for an injury asks another clinician about your overall health condition.\n\nDisclosures related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test results, diagnosis of acquired immune deficiency virus (AIDS) or an AIDS-related condition, however, will not be made without your permission except as required or allowed by law. For example, applicable law may permit us to disclose this information in connection with submitting a claim to your insurance or health plan. We may also disclose your information without your consent if there is an immediate threat to your health or safety, or that of others.\n\n2. Payment. We may use and disclose your PHI to bill and receive payment for services provided to you.\n\nExample: We disclose PHI about you to your health plan to process and pay for the services provided to you.\n\n3. Health Care Operations. We may collect, use, and disclose your PHI to run our business, including technology development and program administration, to improve your care, to contact you, and for other purposes necessary to operate The Transcarent Clinic and provide you with health care services. As part of our health care operations, we may disclose your PHI to our accountants, attorneys, consultants, and others to ensure we are complying with laws applicable to us. We may also disclose your PHI with other health care providers and health plans for their business operations if they have or had a patient relationship with you. We may de-identify your PHI as part of these operations, at which point this Notice will no longer apply.\n\nAdditionally, to improve your care experience, we may send you surveys or requests for feedback regarding our services. You may opt out of these types of communications by following the instructions provided in the survey or feedback request; however, please know, we will continue to communicate with you about the care and services you have received or have scheduled.\n\nFinally, we deploy our AI Care Assistant to support your clinician in starting your visit and it may also explain your care plan to you. When this happens, we may disclose your PHI to third-parties that support our technology; any such disclosure will comply with HIPAA.\n\nExample: We use your PHI to review and improve the quality of services you received, the performance of the professionals who provided care to you, provide customer service, and other health care operations activities.\n\n4. Appointments and Services. We may contact you to remind you of an appointment, arrange follow up or other health care services, or provide a test result. We may also contact you to provide you with information about treatment alternatives or other services and benefits we offer.\n\nOther Uses and Disclosures Related to Your PHI\n\nWe are allowed or required by law to disclose your PHI without your authorization in some additional circumstances – usually in ways that contribute to the public good, such as public health and research. We must meet many conditions in the law before we can share your information for these purposes. These circumstances include:\n\n1. Help with Public Health and Safety Issues. We may disclose PHI in certain situations such as to prevent disease, support product recalls, report adverse reactions or product complaints, or reporting suspected abuse, neglect, or domestic violence\n\n2. Serious and Imminent Threats. We may disclose your information when needed to prevent or reduce a serious threat to you, another person, or the public.\n\n3. Conduct Research. We can use or disclose your information for health research without your permission if an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approves such use or disclosure. (An IRB is a committee that is responsible, under federal law, for reviewing and approving human subjects research to protect the safety of the participants and the confidentiality of PHI.) In the absence of such approval from an IRB, we may only use or disclose your information for research if we first obtain your permission.\n\n4. Health Information Exchange. We may share your PHI electronically with other organizations through a Health Information Exchange (HIE) network. These other organizations may include hospitals, laboratories, health care providers, public health departments, health plans, and other participants. We do this to get your health information to the health care providers treating you quickly and efficiently. HIE participants like The Transcarent Clinic are required to meet rules that protect the privacy and security of your health and personal information. Please note that, if your medical record contains certain information (such as from a substance use disorder program) that requires your authorization under state or federal law before information is shared, then we will not release that information to your other treating providers through HIE until you provide authorization.\n\n5. Comply with Applicable Laws. We may disclose PHI about you when required to do so by federal, state, or local law, judicial or administrative proceedings or law enforcement. For example, we may disclose PHI to government agencies or law enforcement personnel about victims of abuse, neglect or domestic violence or pursuant to federal, state or local laws, subpoena or court order, or other legal process.\n\n6.

Respond to Law Enforcement, Lawsuits, and Legal Actions. We can disclose health information about you for law enforcement purposes or with a law enforcement official, or in response to a court or administrative order, a subpoena request, or other lawful processes, such as if you are involved in a lawsuit or a dispute. However, we will not disclose PHI about you for either of the following activities:\n\nTo conduct a criminal, civil, or administrative investigation into or impose criminal, civil, or administrative liability on any person for the mere act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive health care, where such health care is lawful under the circumstances in which it is provided.\n\nThe identification of any person for the purpose of conducting such investigation or imposing such liability.\n\nWe also will obtain your consent before disclosing information we receive from a substance abuse treatment provider about your treatment.\n\nUses and Disclosures Requiring your Authorization\n\nIn certain cases, we may need your permission, called an Authorization, to use and/or disclose your PHI.\n\nOnce we receive your written revocation, it will apply to future PHI uses and disclosures. You may change your mind at any time. Let us know in writing if you change your mind.\n\nThis Notice of Privacy Practices Applies to the Following Organizations\n\nAll participants of the Transcarent Clinic Organized Health Care Arrangement.\n\nWe contract with third parties to perform some services for us, such as billing or consulting. These third-party service providers, known as Business Associates under HIPAA, can access PHI to perform these services on our behalf. They are required by law, and their agreements with us, to protect your PHI in the same way we do. Transcarent, Inc. is one of our Business Associates.\n\nIV. Your Rights\n\nWhen it comes to your health information, you have certain rights. This section explains your rights and some of our responsibilities to help you.\n\nYour Right to See and Obtain Copies of Your Health Information\n\nYou (or your legally authorized representative) can submit a request using this Medical Records Authorization Form to:\n\nrequest to see or get an electronic or paper copy of your medical record and your other PHI for your records, or\n\nsend your medical record and your other PHI to third-party health care providers or other entities.\n\nOnce we receive a request, we will provide a copy and/or summary within the time frames established by law, typically within 30 days. We may charge a reasonable cost-based fee to cover, for example, applicable copying or mailing costs.\n\nIn certain limited circumstances, we may deny your request to see or receive your PHI. If your request is denied, we will inform you in writing of our reasons for denying your request and explain how you may request a review of that decision, if applicable.\n\nYour Right to Ask Us to Correct or Update Certain PHI\n\nIf you believe that the information we have about you is incorrect or that a piece of important information is missing from your medical records, you may submit an amendment request to us. To do so, you must Contact Us in writing, identifying the specific correction, update, or addition you are requesting, as well as your reason for making such request.\n\nWe will review all requests.

      "# [Products, Competitors, Financials, Employees, Headquarters Locations](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/brightmd)\n98point6 buys contracts from Bright.md, launches asynchronous care module\n\nCare-automation company Bright.md sold its technology to Evernorth last year In March of last year, telehealth platform 98point6 revealed it was switching from being a provider of virtual care to a SaaS provider, meaning it would focus on licensing its software to third-party health care providers. Now, the company is ready to expand its services, announcing on Tuesday the acquisition of 16 customer contracts from care-automation company Bright.md, as well as the launch of a new asynchronous care module. Bright.md, which was founded in 2014, offered an AI-powered platform called SmartExam, which acted as a virtual physician assistant, enabling the physician to deliver efficient care remotely in a fraction of the time by asking patients questions about their symptoms and health history. This past October, the company sold its technology to Evernorth , and now 98point6 has purchased its remaining assets. No financial terms of the deal were disclosed. \"With these acquisitions, we’re not only expanding our reach and strengthening relationships with existing health systems, we’re also gaining valuable insights into the diverse needs of healthcare organizations so that we can continue to effectively tailor our products for patients and providers' evolving preferences,\" Jay Burrell, CEO of 98point6 Technologies, told VatorNews. The launch of the new asynchronous care module, which is backed by machine learning and AI, will allow 98point6 to service these new clients. The module allows providers to respond to patients when their schedule allows. The platform deploys an intelligent engine that supports providers with intake, diagnosis, and care documentation. When combined with the existing live solution, providers will have flexibility to support multiple modes of on-demand virtual care based on patients' lifestyle and care experience preferences. The timing of the two announcements was \"serendipitous,\" Burrell said, noting that, \"the timing of Bright.md’s divestiture offered an outstanding opportunity for 98point6 to accelerate its launch of an asynchronous telehealthcare solution.\" \"98point6 has always been focused on provider enablement and making the provider’s job easier. That positioning remains consistent today: we’re a technology company for healthcare providers. One of our strategies in becoming a SaaS company was focusing on the platform layer, and rolling out new features and functions, starting with the asynchronous module,\" he explained. Going forward, 98point6 will focus on offering a full suite of virtual care services that empower providers with technology-focused solutions that help mitigate clinician burnout, improve patient engagement, and provide substantial cost savings to healthcare organizations. \"We will continue to refine and expand our product offerings based upon feedback from Bright.md’s customers to create innovative technology solutions that solve care delivery organizations’ biggest challenges and improve the patient and provider experience,\" said Burrell. \"98point6 has a proven track record of building software to manage virtual care, and a history of managing a successful nationwide virtual clinic serving millions of patients. The new async care module paves the way for further innovations on the 98point6 Technology Platform.\"",
      "# [Celebrating One Year, One Team, One Place – Transcarent](https://transcarent.com/blog/celebrating-one-year-one-team-one-place)\nGlen Tullman, Chief Executive Officer, Transcarent\n\nBuilding great businesses is something that I love to do, and part of that includes knowing when and how to effectively scale. Acquisitions allow companies to grow by incorporating existing innovations, increasing market share, and many times, expanding the workforce for greater impact. In my 30+ years of building businesses, I have led dozens of mergers and acquisitions of all sizes and on both sides of the transaction. Having witnessed many successes and a few pitfalls, I believe that a shared mission and like-cultures are strong determinants of whether or not a transaction will be successful.\n\nI always say that it is easier to fix something, than to start from scratch. So long as the leadership teams who are involved in a transaction share similar values and relentlessly believe that together, they can deliver a better experience for the end user, M&A activity can be incredibly powerful, improve outcomes and business operations, and be a smart investment.\n\nWhen I first met with the team at 98point6, the leader in AI-enabled virtual care, I saw the value their technology, their clinic, and their wildly talented team, could bring to the future of Transcarent and our Members. With experience dating back to 2017 they were forward-thinking, ahead of the curve in healthcare AI, had a robust portfolio of clients and Members, and most importantly, shared a similar mission as Transcarent. Simply put, they were committed to making health and care better for people, including the physicians and others who deliver care and those of us who receive it. They were looking for directional support, commitment, and leadership that would put their technology in the hands of many more people . . . a strength of ours at Transcarent, and we were in search of forward-looking technology that could transform the virtual primary care experience. After our first discussions, the transaction was complete.\n\nOver the past year, our teams came together with the mindset of “one.” One Team. One Mission. One Place for Health and Care. This cultural mindset was ingrained from the start and made for a nearly flawless integration. Yes, we dropped a few balls along the way, but people always knew what our intent was . . . to make this the best place people ever worked and to create an experience of health and care that was new, better, and different than anything else they had come across. I am proud to say we can celebrate one year as one company that has undeniably achieved more together than we ever could have achieved alone.\n\nNothing is more important than our health and care. And no industry will have more impact on our success as a country in the future. However, despite its importance, no industry is more in need of change and improvement. 98point6 made it easy to access care 24x7x365 – easier and faster than ever before – without losing the physician connection. Since acquiring 98point6, we have continued to invest in their revolutionary AI-powered health and care experience. We even had the opportunity to highlight in front of Congress how we are delivering an experience, leading with clinical expertise, from start to finish, that is private and secure, and built to meet and exceed the needs of health consumers. Additionally, we introduced point-of-care navigation capabilities by combining the power of Transcarent's digital platform and benefit ecosystem with virtual care delivery. Expect to hear more from us regarding AI and the ways it will transform virtual primary care visits.\n\nOne of the things we are most proud of is that we are leveraging one of our greatest assets, clinicians, for the part of the visits that require their intellect and experience. Due to the personal nature of this industry, we can’t rely on technology alone. When considering the acquisition with 98point6, their affiliated Physician Group was one of the strongest selling points. The talented and caring physicians, nurses, and other clinicians who comprise the group complete the experience we’re trying to create at Transcarent . . . one that people love, offers high-quality health and care, and does so at a price that people can afford.\n\nWhen we founded Transcarent, we knew the vision of bringing all of health and care, both virtual and in-person, together on a single platform, wasn’t going to be easy or fast. But we’re here, committed as ever, with a steadfast focus on our mission of providing access to high-quality, affordable health and care. We’ve taken the steps necessary, including M&A activity and integrating other innovative solutions into our platform, to build an easy-to-use platform for our Members and clients and company for our employees.\n\nOur work is well underway, we’ve come a long way, but as Bill Gates wisely said, “If I'd had some set idea of a finish line, don't you think I would have crossed it years ago?”\n\nThanks to everyone at Transcarent for your hard work and commitment to making the last year a success.",

      "# [Seattle Chicken Chain Mt. Joy Wants to Conquer the World, Then Save It by Harry Cheadle on 2023-12-13](https://seattle.eater.com/2023/12/13/23999134/mt-joy-fried-chicken-sandwich-regenerative-farming-seattle-robbie-cape)\nIt’s a bright, windy fall day on Capitol Hill, and Robbie Cape has crouched down to futz with the legs on the inflatable tube man outside Mt. Joy, his food truck. “It’s not straight,” Cape says, making an adjustment before muttering, “That’ll have to do.”\n\nCape is a bald, middle-aged man with the infectious energy of a tech entrepreneur and the plastic-rimmed glasses of a tech entrepreneur. He worked at Microsoft before founding and then selling the family-scheduling app Cozi; he followed that up by co-founding the chatbot telemedicine startup 98point6 and serving as its CEO until the board replaced him in 2021. That’s an unusual resume for the operator of a fried chicken sandwich joint, but Mt. Joy is so much more than a food truck and a nearby brick-and-mortar restaurant. To hear Cape tell it, the inflatable tube man marks the beachhead of a chain that will one day have hundreds of locations. Mt. Joy already has a sleek website, an app, and a team that includes Ethan Stowell, Seattle’s most bankable restaurateur, who is a co-founder.\n\nBut Cape is dreaming even bigger: He envisions a future where Mt. Joy pressures the nation’s food-supply system to reform in a way that will improve conditions for livestock, raise wages for farmworkers, and even fight climate change. Oh, and at that point, Mt. Joy will be a billion-dollar company.\n\n“When I started looking for my next gig after Cozi,” Cape tells Eater Seattle, “I wanted to work on companies that checked two boxes… Number one, the companies had to be multibillion-dollar opportunities — like, at scale, they could be valued at billions of dollars. And number two, that at that scale they could repair the world in a meaningful way.” This makes Mt. Joy possibly the most ambitious, audacious food business in Seattle. It’s certainly the most ambitious business that started in the parking lot of a former Starbucks.\n\nAfter leaving 98point6, Cape was trying to figure out his next move, and he wasn’t thinking about restaurants. He was thinking about the environment. His research, which included watching the 2020 documentary Kiss the Ground, led him to focus on “regenerative agriculture,” a somewhat vague term that refers to a set of practices that advocates say are more in tune with nature and better for the planet than industrial farming methods.\n\nSometimes, those advocates for regenerative agriculture make grandiose claims. In Kiss the Ground, over a montage of climate change-related disasters, narrator Woody Harrelson says that there’s “a simple solution, a way to heal our planet and keep our species off the extinction list.” He goes on:\n\nWe call it soil, earth, or ground. And due to its vast scale and its ability to sequester immense quantities of greenhouse gases, it could just be the one thing that can balance our climate, replenish our freshwater supplies, and feed the world.\n\nRegenerative Organic Alliance, an organization that certifies farms as “Regenerative Organic” and therefore has to be more rigorous than Woody Harrelson, has a list of practices farmers should adopt to meet its standards. This includes crop rotation or the seasonal use of cover crops (rather than using a plot of land to grow only one thing, aka monoculture); tilling, or breaking the soil with a plow or other machine, as little as possible; raising livestock alongside crops; and not using synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. The goal of all this is to maintain a healthy ecosystem of insects, worms, and fungus in the soil, which makes it more resistant to erosion, more able to hold water, and capable of sequestering carbon from the air, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help fight climate change. To be certified by ROA, farms must pay their workers fairly and treat them well (a standard not all farms have lived up to). They must also care for their animals better than industrial farms do — allowing chickens to roam freely on pastures, for instance — which advocates say makes the meat taste better.\n\n“The concept of regenerative agriculture, it set my brain on fire,” Cape says. “Here’s a methodology that is better for the farmer, better for the animals, better for the land. And it produces a product that’s better for the people. Why aren’t more people doing it?”\n\nCape set out to talk to regenerative farmers. One of them was Grant Jones, the owner of Hungry Hollow Farm in Shelton, a couple hours southwest of Seattle. “The big bottleneck is demand,” Jones tells Eater Seattle. “We need more people to buy our product; we need more people to care about what we’re doing.”\n\nEventually, the Mt. Joy founder talked to Joel Salatin, one of the country’s most famous regenerative farmers. “He’s like, ‘Robbie, if you want to get more farmers to farm this way, you need to launch a restaurant,’” Cape recalls of the conversation. “‘If you build demand for food that is grown this way, the supply will follow.’” (Salatin, who at one point was a sort-of spokesperson for the regenerative agriculture movement, is also a right-wing political eccentric who flouted pandemic lockdown rules. He has no association whatsoever with Mt. Joy.)\n\nCape initially rejected the idea because he knew nothing about the restaurant industry. But after conversations with friends and restaurant industry professionals, including Ethan Stowell — who owns How to Cook a Wolf, Rione XIII, and too many other restaurants to name — he gradually became convinced that a restaurant was the right path forward. Cape is an entrepreneur who believes, maybe unfashionably, that a for-profit business can make the world a better place. “For all of the issues I have with Elon Musk,” he says, “he showed the market that you could build a great car business worth a lot of money as an electric-vehicle company.” What Musk did to popularize electric cars, Cape could maybe do for chickens.\n\nNationwide, there are a lot of entrepreneurs like Cape trying to disrupt the food industry for the better, whether that means investing in plant-based “meat” or lab-grown chicken; chickens and eggs that are labeled “regenerative” or “pasture-raised” are now commonplace in grocery stores and direct-to-consumer sites. In one sense, Cape is hopping on a trend; in another, he’s trying to accelerate it.\n\nAs Cape set out to develop Mt. Joy, he met with Stowell frequently to learn the restaurant business, and brought the restaurateur on as a co-founder. Cape also staged (the restaurant equivalent of working an unpaid internship) at two of Stowell’s restaurants, Victor’s Tavern and the Woodinville location of Ballard Pizza — the 54-year-old’s first-ever restaurant experience. “It was great! I loved it!” Cape says. “Restaurants are very often balancing on the tip of a needle, between organized and chaos. It’s amazing how they do it.” He has a scar on his arm from a pizza oven, which he is happy to show off.\n\nSo: Why chicken? From the very first meeting, Cape says, Stowell “intuited” that their venture should be a fried chicken restaurant. “It turns out that’s the right answer for a lot of reasons,” Cape says. For one thing, chicken, particularly fried chicken, is exploding in popularity. (There’s a Korean fried chicken place across the street from the Mt. Joy truck, and Dave’s Hot Chicken, a Nashville-style chain, opened on Capitol Hill the same week as the Mt. Joy restaurant.) Another reason has to do with the short lives of chickens. “Given that we’re building a new supply chain, it turns out that an animal with a relatively short gestation period and a relatively short lifespan is better, because it allows us to cycle up the supply chain faster,” Cape says.\n\nAlready, he says, Mt. Joy’s presence is encouraging local farms to produce regeneratively farmed chicken. Jones, of Hungry Hollow, has joined the company as a co-founder and chief agricultural officer, and Mt. Joy is using four other Western Washington farms to supply it with chickens. While a small farm might have to predict the appropriate amount of chickens to raise annually, having consistent preordering from a customer allows farms to invest in raising more birds. “Within a few months, we were able to get additional production out of them that they were not counting on producing,” Cape says, because Mt. Joy could commit to buying their chickens. (Regeneratively farmed chickens are expensive; Mt. Joy pays nearly $8 a pound for whole birds.)\n\nThe company has also recruited Mark Anderson, a farmer and the owner of Anderson Hay in Ellensburg, Washington. Anderson raises grass-fed beef cattle using regenerative methods, and next year will be raising chickens for Mt. Joy, early proof of Cape’s theory that he can create the supply chain he needs as his business grows. Anderson will be processing chickens as well; he says he can process tens of thousands of animals if Mt. Joy needs it. (As of mid-December, the company has used about 4,000 chickens total, Cape says.)\n\n“I’m very, very aligned with Robbie, I think his vision and mission is spot-on,” says Anderson. “I don’t think he does anything he doesn’t deeply believe in... He’s a great visionary.”\n\nMt. Joy’s first brick-and-mortar restaurant opened on December 1 on 11th Avenue and Pine Street, just across the street from Cal Anderson Park. If Cape’s dreams come true, that restaurant will be followed swiftly by others in Western Washington, then more in other regions, until one day Mt. Joy is as ubiquitous and numerous as Chipotle. (Cape is looking to expand to the East Side, though he says he needs to “raise additional capital” before any expansion.) At some point, Mt. Joy would become such a big buyer of chicken that it would have influence over how chickens are raised across a broader supply chain. “Our goal is to reach a scale where we can impact the entire industry,” Cape says.\n\nIf Mt. Joy achieves whatCape envisions — a daunting prospect — it will have to contend with the slippery nature of the word “regenerative.”\n\n“A person can say, ‘I’m farming regeneratively,’ and you don’t really know exactly what that means,” says Melissa Spear, the executive director of Tilth Alliance, a nonprofit that promotes regenerative farming, among other food- and farming-related policies. As regenerative farming has become hip, large companies like General Mills have touted regenerative initiatives that stop well short of what advocates like Spear would like to see — General Mills promotes low- and no-till farming, “which is actually really important,” Spear says, but continues to use pesticides, which are generally frowned upon in the regenerative community.\n\nOne way to cut through the ambiguity around the term regenerative is the regenerative organic certification process, by which farms can get an outside stamp of approval. But many small and midsize farmers interested in these practices aren’t taking this route, Spear says, because it is expensive and time-consuming. “Part of what needs to happen in general is we need to make getting certified easier,” she says.\n\nMt. Joy hasn’t focused on getting its farms certified primarily due to cost, Cape says. “Our perspective is that we want to be completely transparent,” he says. “We don’t need the certification because we want to show you the farm.” (On the Mt. Joy website, you can see videos of the chickens in pastures.)\n\nSpear isn’t necessarily satisfied with Mt. Joy’s current level of disclosure, however. She wants to know how much the company pays its workers, among other things — “total transparency.” (Cape says Mt. Joy offers a “very competitive wage,” benefits, and equity in the company after three months.)\n\nIf Mt. Joy ever did become so large and powerful that it could tell farmers how to raise chickens, Cape has already sketched out some ideas for what he would request of its future suppliers: He would ask them to raise the Freedom Ranger Color Yield, chickens specifically bred to live outside, and to put the birds on fresh pasture every day. “We want our chickens to live in their natural habitat and be intelligently incorporated into the farm ecosystem,” he says. This is better for the chickens and better for the soil, too: As the chickens scratch and peck at the earth and fertilize it with their manure, they improve the soil health.\n\nWould those practices be enough for advocates like Spear to agree their chickens are “regenerative”? Maybe, maybe not.\n\nAnother question around regenerative farming is exactly how much carbon soil can sequester, and for how long. This is a highly technical matter and researchers are looking into it, but the planet-saving portrayal in Kiss the Ground is almost certainly too optimistic. (Spear calls the film “kind of like propaganda” while praising the attention it’s brought to regenerative farming.)\n\nMt. Joy’s marketing materials don’t lean too hard into the save-the-climate messaging, and Cape says that’s because he believes the question “How much carbon can the soil sequester and for how long?” is a “red herring.” More importantly, he says, regenerative farming is better for the soil and animals and provides better wages for the people working in the supply chain than traditional industrial farming.\n\nCould Mt. Joy help push the U.S. toward regenerative practices? First, it has to be a successful business, which requires it to make a sandwich people love. As Cape puts it: “The conduit of our platform is the fried chicken sandwich.” The conduit’s breading has a briny, umami bite to it, while the meat inside is juicy and flavorful. Unusually, Mt. Joy sells a dark meat sandwich, which gives you an extra layer of richness and gaminess. Though the chicken is the star ingredient, it’s balanced out by tangy pickles and a slightly crunchy tomato. Mt. Joy also sells fries with a variety of sauces and high-quality shakes in flavors like strawberry basil.\n\nThe in-utero chain may be setting out to revolutionize the chicken industry on the supply side. But in terms of customer experience, no wheel is getting reinvented here. It’s the typical 21st-century fast-casual journey, where you walk in, order on a touchscreen, and get a pretty good, pretty satisfying sandwich for around $15.\n\nMt. Joy is also, apart from all that other stuff, a pretty typical food truck. It’s centered around a single dish, aided by some splashy branding, and run by a dreamer with more than the usual amount of energy — the kind of person who gets into the restaurant industry, when you get right down to it. In the days before the restaurant opened, Cape was at the truck a lot, he says, “doing whatever needs to be done,” adjusting inflatable men, saying hello to customers, asking how the food was, telling them he looks forward to seeing them come back.\n\nIs this fun for the former tech CEO, owning a restaurant? “Oh,” he says with a smile, “I love it!”"
