      "# [98point6 Technologies on 2024-03-08](https://www.98point6.com/platform/)\nAsynchronous care, or “async,” is a type of virtual care with no scheduling requirements, giving the patient the flexibility and convenience to seek care for non-urgent concerns whenever and wherever they’d like. Whereas a response from a provider may occur quickly, there is no real-time interaction between the patient and the medical staff. This type of dedicated care also helps with capturing revenue by incorporating patient messages from a provider’s inbox back into the patient chart to enhance the continuity of care. 98point6 can support your clinicians in asynchronously diagnosing and treating more than 140 common conditions for patients across all ages—from pediatrics to geriatrics.\n\nOur AI-powered solution leverages evidence-based clinical content, machine learning, and automation to recommend the optimal care option, while also giving patients the ability to choose the format they prefer. Customizable to the specific workflow of the healthcare organization, the clinician can direct the patient to real-time care or prompt them to seek in-person care if their medical concern cannot be treated asynchronously.\n\nReal-time virtual care can consist of text-based messaging, audio, or video interactions, or any combination of the three. Additionally, real-time care can be facilitated as an on-demand or scheduled visit. On-demand visits allow patients to immediately start a visit, any time, from anywhere. Patients can report symptoms and concerns and our product gathers relevant history, before connecting the patient to a clinician. Wait times in the queue are dependent on clinician availability. Scheduled visits allow patients to choose a date and time in the future that is most convenient for them.\n\nOur patient intake automates much of the administrative tasks associated with taking a history. Our product is trained, based on millions of patient encounters, to respond to patient-reported symptoms with question sets, written by physicians, that elicit relevant clinical details for provider review. It works like this: the patient enters their chief complaint as free text. They can write as much or as little as they want to communicate the reason for their visit and their symptoms. The 98point6 platform intakes all of that information and then generates the appropriate follow-up questions.\n\nOur patient intake process significantly reduces the administrative burden on clinicians – and automatically captures an accurate transcript of patient-reported symptoms.\n\nWe have been applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to medical encounters since 2015. As a result, we have a vast data set that is one-of-a-kind in the field of natural language processing for medical applications. We utilize Al and machine learning to improve both efficiency and medical quality by automating time-consuming tasks, allowing clinicians to focus their judgment on key decision points in the clinical encounter. Our system provides information and actions for the clinician to consider; however, the clinician is in complete control of the visit diagnosis, and care planning.\n\nData integration is cornerstone to the 98point6 platform. EMR data can be automatically pulled into the clinician console, and once the visit is complete, data is automatically sent to the EMR to be recorded in the patient’s medical record. Our standards-based integration supports Epic and Cerner, as well as other EMRs. The platform also supports data integrations for analytics, reporting, security and compliance and other administrative needs.",

As part of the deal, hundreds of 98point6 enterprise customers including Boeing, Kindercare and Banner|Aetna employing millions of eligible members will have access to an even wider selection of primary and behavioral health services through Transcarent. The newly emerged 98point6 Technologies plans to remain solely focused on licensing its software to third-party health care providers such as MultiCare Health System, the first to license the 98point6 Technology Platform within its hybrid ambulatory care platform, Indigo Health.\n\n“Our evolution to 98point6 Technologies answers the need for purpose-built technology created by physicians, for physicians, and is the culmination of work our front-line team of clinicians spent years perfecting,” said Jay Burrell, President and Chief Executive Officer of 98point6 Technologies. “This comes at a time when every provider in the health services industry is on an urgent mission to remain competitive in what has become an increasingly crowded and undifferentiated marketplace.”\n\nIn today’s market, demand for telehealth services has stabilized at 38 times higher than pre-pandemic levels and healthcare providers are scrambling to catch up, citing telehealth implementation as a top challenge. According to new research only 13% of hospitals and health systems consider themselves ahead of the pace of change that patients expect and new market rivals are setting, and only 11% of health systems report being in the implementation phase of their personalized care and digital transformation journeys.\n\nHealth systems recognize they must move quickly to solidify their brand presence and physical footprint, starting with the expansion of their ambulatory care business and introduction of new technology and consumer-centered services. Gartner’s Hype Cycle for Healthcare Providers, 2022 corroborated the shift, stating “we see greater provider interest and focus on virtual care and total experience to meet clinical and business demands.”\n\nTechnology Built to Give Health Care Providers a Competitive Edge\n\nThe 98point6 Technology Platform provides a turn-key, cloud-based solution for scaling up a virtual care operation complete with software, professional services and support from a team who built and operated a successful, nationwide virtual clinic for the past several years. The platform provides a quick and cost effective way to create new revenue opportunities, better support the workforce, improve care and boost the bottom line. Implementation includes a client-branded app and assistance in configuring the platform.\n\n“Our strategic partnership with 98point6 will help us scale our digital capabilities to meet community demand and bring a new level of meaningful engagement to our customers,” said Ryan Fix, President of Retail Health at MultiCare.\n\nAt the heart of the 98point6 Technology Platform is a web-based Clinician Console, which encapsulates a refined set of best practices designed to help providers deliver high quality virtual care based on years of clinical experience. Built-in logic in the form of artificial intelligence (AI) and automated practice standards guide providers to quickly make the right medical decisions or recommend in-person care when needed. This level of automation limits care variability, optimizes patient time by streamlining the intake process and reduces cognitive load on the provider to support top-of-licensure practice.\n\nThe 98point6 Technology Platform includes:\n\nA standalone digital clinic hosted in the cloud, including AI-powered patient engagement, workflow and EHR integration, care follow-up and documentation.\n\nWeb-based Clinician Console for providers to conduct visits.\n\nAn SDK to create a fully-branded patient experience.\n\nTraining and development for clinicians and staff.\n\nEngagement marketing support to activate new users and drive utilization.\n\nWorkforce management guidance to help define hybrid staffing and scheduling plans.\n\nFor more information on 98point6 Technologies, visit 98point6.com.\n\nAbout 98point6 Technologies\n\n98point6 Technologies builds and licenses software to power exceptional virtual care experiences for providers and patients based on years of clinical use across millions of patients.

I ended up going to push health and got it refilled. Second time using this app I was wanting to get antibiotics for my sons ear infection, I looked inside his ear with an otoscope and it was really red. This is not his first ear infection. The dr said to get him tested for covid. What?! He had an ear at infection not covid. He has really bad allergies that causes fluid in his ears. Well it caused an ear infection in his left ear. The dr said it is probably a cold causing the redness in the ear and will go away in a few days. I told her no it’s an ear infection and he needs antibiotics . She wouldn’t help. I took him to his pediatrician she confirmed the ear infection and prescribed antibiotics. I was hoping the app would of been useful but it’s a joke along with the crappy drs.",

Can't afford the $100+ for a doctor's appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there's a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\n\nSo I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It's $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I'm drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I'm still in bad shape tomorrow morning it's worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\n\nGuys, it was amazing.  It's not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I'd already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn't help.  She was so kind, and didn't make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor's appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it's faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can't prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I'd taken in the past wasn't an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What's the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\n\nUsually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it's what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you'll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can't estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\n\nThis amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I'll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn't shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that's a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\n\nI would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It's not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it's a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\n\nIf anyone else has recommendations or critiques or thoughts on internet medicine stuff I'd love to hear it.\n\n## Comment ID elj1h0o with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/elj1h0o/) (in reply to ID bg7ip2):\nThat sounds like a great resource!

Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.\n\nA prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\n\nControlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\n\nSo the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.  Neither medication can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor, but Vicodin is super extra hard to get prescribed.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nEDIT: I tried to clarify the original post to make it more obvious that although she couldn't prescribe the thing I'd taken in the past, she did prescribe a thing that helped a lot.  It actually helped even more than the thing I'd taken in the past and without making me drowsy, which is AWESOME!\n\n#### Comment ID elkh6df with +3 score by [(Mr_Fuzzo, Reddit, 2019-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/elkh6df/) (in reply to ID eljx9uw):\nControlled substances, for the un-initiated are medications like opiates, barbiturates, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, etc.\n\nSo, meds like Xanax, OxyContin, Ritalin, etc.\n\n#### Comment ID eljy54o with +2 score by [(AnotherDay_RS, Reddit, 2019-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bg7ip2/internet_medicine_is_awesome_98point6_was_so_so/eljy54o/) (in reply to ID eljx9uw):\nThat's great!!

Words can’t describe how much I hate that stupid company. I’d recommend calling your primary care provider and explaining the situation. Most of the time they can write it as long as you can show a diagnosis and proof you’ve taken it before. \n\nThat’ll also protect you from losing your prescription when the pandemic exemption eventually expires— it’s a general rule for controlled substances that you need at least one in-person meeting with the doctor before they can fill it. I think some places don’t require this, but AFAIK it was a requirement pre-2020. I know they did also always require the person who prescribed it to be in-state back then as well. \n\nAt least they stopped requiring you to physically deliver HANDWRITTEN prescriptions. That was the stupidest thing. You’d normally get 3 at a time, and if you lost one for the month? Sucks to suck. Can’t think of a less adhd-friendly system. I think that changed 2018-ish?

Luckily, I get my prescriptions just fine at my local Walgreens (but had to switch to an independent pharmacy just because of shortages at the wholesaler), but the whole reason I was able to get diagnosed and prescribed medication was because of how accessible telehealth services are. Finding a prescriber/doctor and therapist on my own and going in person were more than my depressed, anxious brain struggling with executive functioning can handle, and I'm sure it's the same for many people.\n\nProviders write Rxs.

I love the simplicity and often lower cost of telehealth, but I honestly wonder if they ever decline to give out a prescription. If you want Adderall, you just pay the online provider and get a script. There are even telehealth services for testosterone replacement therapy prescribing 200mg of testosterone to 19 year old kids who basically want legal anabolic steroids. I've seen guys with testosterone levels of 800pg/dL getting TRT scripts for quadruple the normal dosage. While some providers may be acting responsibly, there are countless services that are not.\n\nAdderall works great for a lot of people, there are plenty of people that depend on it. It is also a dangerous stimulant that is wickedly over-prescribed. I can understand the pharmacy having hesitations about this. In the not-so-distant past, it was opioids being handed out like candy. We are approaching a similar situation with psychostimulants.\n\n\n\n#### Comment ID isw0m6l with +1 score by [(Random_182f2565, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/isw0m6l/) (in reply to ID isu7f5c):\nIsn't that just bad faith tho?\n\n#### Comment ID isx707b with +1 score by [(NegotiationTx, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/isx707b/) (in reply to ID isu7f5c):\nThey can ef off with that policy.

Basically pill mills started up, and doctors at them would write scripts for millions of pills for \"patients\" all over the country that they could never have possibly seen. So as a response Walgreens (and CVS, I believe), the two largest pharmacy chains in the US, have instituted a policy that if you are presenting a new script, the prescriber is not local, and you've not been on the medication before, the pharmacist can, and usually will require that they speak to the doctor to confirm the script, dosage, and DX before dispensing the drug. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get telehealth can be a good thing, but for psychoactive medication that can be abused like stimulants, I think what Walgreens and CVS are doing is a reasonable control mechanism on  MDs/DOs/PAs/APNs just writing scripts like crazy.\n\n#### Comment ID isvvl0w with +4 score by [(Tragically_Fantastic, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/isvvl0w/) (in reply to ID isve0mi):\nI do think it's an ok policy, but basically what this pharmacist said was if they can get in touch with my prescriber, they'll fill it one time, but after that they won't do it again, which feels kinda backwards to me?

I couldn’t get myself to just find a therapist or a way to get help that I could tell I desperately needed. I got prescribed a non-stimulant from the telehealth provider and it was a pain in the ass to get answers to my concerns about the medication side effects.

I have not had one ounce of ill will or trouble from anyone at Mayo, and I can just go to their pharmacy and get my Rx filled. The worst part is waiting between appointments... The journey from initial consult to CBT appointments and then confirmation with a psych eval and prescribing meds took about a year, not because they were unsure, but because the calendars were (and remain) pretty well booked up. Side note: I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder (recurrent), and that's why I had CBT appointments mixed in there. They had to rule out anxiety before ADHD, but the doc smartly suggested the ADHD was leading to my anxiety, so he is treating the ADHD first.

I promise we aren’t trying to make life miserable for you. I have adhd too. We have a duty to fill a prescription “in good faith” - I can lose my license otherwise. Example: There are 2 providers from telehealth that I see hundreds and hundreds of Adderall rx from - from their FL, CO, and CA office. I do not see them prescribe *anything* except Adderall. At all. That is a massive red flag for me. They have also (confirmed) never met with any of their patients in person. Another red flag. \n\nI can also understand that seeing a doctor in person is difficult for some people and their schedules- I have to schedule an appt once every 3 months in person myself and it is very difficult with my unpredictable schedule. Bottom line is our license and livelihood is on the line. I think of telehealth as a non-permanent solution while establishing a provider in your community.\n\nLastly, with so many rx now coming from telehealth we are hitting our max of many stimulants that we can order from the DEA on a monthly basis. I cannot take care of our current clientele with the massive influx - we already hit our DEA limit as it is. I usually suggest folks try another pharmacy in a more suburban area (we are urban and Adderall-sense) so you don’t have to go weeks without your medication. \n\nAlso as some others have mentioned, C2s cannot be transferred so you will need to have your prescriber send in a new rx to the pharmacy at which you want to have it filled. \n\nWe’re also extremely understaffed which complicates everything. Please be nice to us. It is hell on earth at most pharmacies right now. \n\n**I would suggest doing mail order pharmacy to get your med (Amazon has a pharmacy) or any independent pharmacy in your area.** I hope this helps clarify some misunderstandings.\n\n### Comment ID isyt1l9 with +2 score by [(Tragically_Fantastic, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/isyt1l9/) (in reply to ID isyqlmt):\nYeah, I understand that.

It used to be sooo easy with my psychiatrist. Dr. Awesome would prescribe my meds for 90 days. So I would call her once every 3 months and l would... get this... only have to leave her a message. All her phone calls went directly to voice mail. And if I left her with my name, meds refilled and phone number to reach me I would get a notification 1 hour later that she sent my script in. I would see her in person every six months as a general check up. So fucking easy. \n\nBut she retired... now i go to my practioner because I'm fucking stable! (Honestly super proud of that accomplishment) however, this new doctor can't prescribe them for 90 days only 30. So every month I have to remember to call their office. Explain to the person on the phone what I need. That yes I have two meds with the same name. I've been through this routine so many times I can pronounce dexemethlyfenidate. She passes it along to the doctor. Doctor approves it and after two days if the pharmacy doesn't call me I have to call them to make sure it got pushed through. Wait another day. Now it takes them a week or so to figure out billing me. By the time they do bill me I forget about it and it ends up getting close to being over due. I pay the bill.

I wonder if its a blessing in disguise for some people. Guys if you are going through this, do not let it stress you. This is what I did, now be prepared because it is going to sound cheesy because I am a very cheesy person... When Walgreens made me wait 3 weeks for my newly prescribed telehealth Adderall 10mgs during the last few weeks of school (including finals), it made me feel like... worse than poop. I will admit when I got the RX, I had the most surreal sense of calm and peace. Like finally my war was over and I could be treated like a normal person. I didn't have to seek illegal alternatives anymore and feel like a criminal. I could finally get help for my issues and my life was about to improve dramatically. Then doubt crept in, I am not worth this RX, I am not worth getting better, I am a criminal, I am a bad person. I do not deserve to be high functioning like my friends and family. I deserve to live the life I am living. (Obviously have self-esteem issues) With all this thinking floating around in my head, I called Walgreens to see if they ahd received my medication, and this started the whole awkward \"Oh, the medication is on back-order and we do not know when it will be in.\" If a pharmacy wants to fill your RX, the alternative to this wil be \"Oh, your medication is not in stock but go ahead and get your RX sent in so we can get it in stock ASAP.\" There is no such thing as just telling a patient who has been prescribed a medication by a licensed physician that their medication is just not available with no explanation. I did not know this though. It took me weeks to learn this. I thought the medication was really out of stock! It took calling other pharmacies and hearing the condescending tone in their nvoice that made me realize this was a catch all resposne to telehealth prescriptions. They even started denying the other script that I had been getting for over 5 years through telehealth! (Suboxone - huge deal to be cut off).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was so down in the dumps. Then I was taught a new method of thinking by a person I look up to. I started ending all the negative shit. I started saying positive stuff to myself to build myself up... \"You are a pre-med student and will get any treatment you need for any illness you are diagnosed with.\" I looked on reddit for pharmacies that other students of UCF were using and not having trouble getting their rX'S filled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI basically changed up my thinking and if I got a negative response from a pharmacy (I did, a few times...) I simply acted confused (Because deep down I was anyways)... If someone treats you in a way you know for a fact you do not deserve, do not get upset back at them, do not get upset period... It is okay to show confusion, which is justified. Acting confused changed up the dynamics so much that a few pharmacy techs even explained to me what was actually going on, Walgreens had decided to implement a policy where the prescribing doctor had to be within a 30 mile radius of the patient and had seen the patient in the last year. Other pharmacies were following their lead. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a good person. I do however have ADHD. I deserve treatment. I deserve to be treated with respect. Trust me, okay, there is a way to get your RX filled. It may not be through Walgreens, but there is a way if you keep up your spirits and be true to what you deserve. Do not use this as an excuse to get frustrated and head back to the streets for illegal adderall. Fight for your own prescription!!!!  \n\n\nI ended up getting mine filled at a Costco, a pharamcy which has been deemed to be problematic for telehealth prescriptions. However I did not have one single problem with them and they treated me like a decent human being. Yes its 1 hour from my house, but I will gladly pass all the pharmacies that literally are 100% fine with prescribing 1,000,000s of lethal Oxycontin pills but not 1 helpful stimulant or OUD MAT therapy.\n\n## Comment ID j6dvo6h with +1 score by [(PenaltyParticular909, Reddit, 2023-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/y7elk6/they_dont_like_telehealth_providers_apparently/j6dvo6h/) (in reply to ID y7elk6):\nThat's why I stopped going to Big box pharmacies because they're always looking at you sideways like they don't drink their bottles of wine as soon as they get home.

      "# Post ID ru2atc: Costco Employee trying to call out sick but can't because I open with +0 score by [(ShiranaiJittai, Reddit, 2022-01-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/ru2atc/costco_employee_trying_to_call_out_sick_but_cant/)\nThankfully we get the day off on Major Holidays. Unthankfully ADMIN is closed as well and  I am sick have been for several days and it is very likely the transformer variant Omicron. I don't know yet because I was to busy trying to remain alive barely able to move except to sip water or gatorade while looking at the ever increasing temperature reading on my thermometer 104.1 is my record so far? Go me? Currently its at 100.9 so much better than it was before.\n\nBut ya since the dirty little secret of holiday day entails that you don't get the pay if you don't work the previous and next shifts between that day. I didn't want to call out I really didn't want to I knew probably by about 7 tonight that there was no way I was going to be able to go in.\n\nWe have to give notice an hour before our shift right? Normally that would be fine just one problem. I open. This morning in 4 hours. I looked up the unum number and called it but an automated message told me UNUM hours and disconnected the call. So clearly not the number I have called before.\n\nI haven't got a test because I can't find a pharmacy nearby that stocked any my mom ordered one offline that said it would get there on friday (when she was ordering it for herself) then it said sunday and now it says TBD)\n\nI seriously considered just calling out ahead of time on Friday Night but figured what kind of lunatic calls out sick over a day before their shift. Now that the temperature isn't as high and hallucinations have faded from the frying of my brain I realize the lunatic is the one who DOESNT call out a day before knowing full well you won't be better a day after having a 104 degree fever.\n\nBut like protocols and all that right. I am pretty damn sure I have it but I have not officially been tested as such have no documented proof to give other than 5 of the 17 people at family christmas party have it. Ive been vaccinated J&J but not boostered (had planned to eventually should have acted sooner) I don't even care about the covid pay my brain and muscles hurt to much for me to care about anything but this hell ending. But I do care about accountability and not being marked as a no call no show because I didn't give an hours notice. When I can't because if I work at 4am and managers enter the building at 345 am wtf am I supposed to do?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. If anyone has the unum number that redirects to the afterhours thing or the teledoc I would appreciate it. If it matters I work in SE in GA\n\n## Comment ID hqwjxln with +15 score by [(cursesonyourmom, Reddit, 2022-01-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/ru2atc/costco_employee_trying_to_call_out_sick_but_cant/hqwjxln/) (in reply to ID ru2atc):\nPer the 2019 employee agreement\n\n4.

I need to choose a healthcare option, and was told about 7-8 different options new Boeing employees have.\n\nHas anyone chosen the traditional health plan vs the Advantage+ HSA ones through blue cross or enterprise?\n\nI like the enterprise option but it also seems too good to be true with the $1200 put in from Boeing which basically pays for the deductible...\n\nIf anyone could share their experience with the Boeing advantage+ healthcare with the HSA and Boeing contribution, it's really help me!

It's free money that you can save and even invest as an extra retirement fund. You can also use it for many health-related purchases. If you are someone who frequently pays for healthcare then it might not make as much sense.\n\n### Comment ID j6tn9ll with +5 score by [(SimpleObserver1025, Reddit, 2023-02-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/boeing/comments/10qxbf7/choosing_healthcare_hsa_all_day/j6tn9ll/) (in reply to ID j6sdzco):\nThis. If you're not spending much each year, it's your best option. If you're worried about catastrophic scenarios, the HSA does have a maximum out-of-pocket of $6,500, so you won't have to pay more than that in any given year. The only reason you might look at the other plans is if you fall somewhere in between.\n\nAs for your concern about \"too good to be true\", the reality is that for the company, it's still the cheapest option even with the annual HSA contribution since few will hit that maximum unless there is a catastrophic health event. The other plans, HMO and traditional, are really expensive per head in comparison.\n\n#### Comment ID j74u5mo with +2 score by [(Schrodingers_Mew, Reddit, 2023-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/boeing/comments/10qxbf7/choosing_healthcare_hsa_all_day/j74u5mo/) (in reply to ID j6tn9ll):\nThank you for your input!!\n\nI think I'm going to to HSA, as of now I'm very healthy..I guess I just feel weird \"betting\" that I'm going to continue to be healthy and won't have any catastrophic health episodes in the next few years... Choosing the hsa puts me in a mindset where Im essentially thinking ok, paying out of pocket ( let's say OoP to keep the Boeing acronym thing going haha) , it's gonna be like $300 ish per doc visit which, is going to be a huge incentive to just NEVER GO, \n\nThe help desk lady I cled did say we can use that $1200 towards the deductible though, so essentially we get 2-3 \"free aka funded\" doc visits per year ..\n\nBut like, how are we supposed to bet we won't have any catastrophic health episodes ?

Last year I had to have unexpected surgery and it wasn’t nearly as expensive as I feared. I use my HSA and max out my contribution for peace of mind. Boeing’s $650 contribution helps a lot. Every year I do math for traditional and still isn’t worth it (premium wise) to me.\n\nEdit to add: Anything covered by the plan will be covered.

Making sure that you put that premium savings into the HSA via paycheck contributions and use it to pay for medical expenses, you'll at least break even with the Traditional plans.\n\nHIgh deductible health plans save companies money because people mentally don't consider annual healthcare expenses to be a sunk cost and will forego care because they are scared of the first couple bills before they meet their deductible when in reality if they had other plans that money would be spent on premiums regardless of their healthcare needs.\n\nThere is advice out there not to choose a HDHP if one is having a baby that year or anticipates a lot of healthcare expenses, but that is actually not generally the thing to do based on how Boeing prices the plans.",

My MLOA request was denied recently, and now I’m at -2.5 hours of UPT. I just received the negative UPT notification, so I’m worried I might be fired soon.

I made sure to reply to the email explaining my situation. \n\nShould I try to pick up extra hours and VTO to get my UPT balance back up while I still have my job?

Just make sure u fill out a medical LOA for the date you left, make sure its under continuous leave and fill out the form. As long as you have an ACTIVE medical LOA case open, amazon has to give you 30 days for you to submit appropriate documents supporting ur case :) so even if ur negative u cant get terminated. How do i know this bc last tuesday i left work to care after my partner bc shes pregnant with my child and she has bad asthma. I was negative -6.43 and was told by hr they are sorry and hope all gets better but if i didnt make a DLS case withing 24 hrs itll result in termination. So i called and uplouded her doctors note explaining everything and how shes \"high risk pregnancy\" and they approved it and returned my time withing like 4-5 hrs. So dont worry, hope this helped and u resolve ur issue :))))\n\n### Comment ID luod5sd with +11 score by [(JokicMurray, Reddit, 2024-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/1gg93cq/just_got_fired/luod5sd/) (in reply to ID luo9m0p):\nWork extra hours to try get your UPT at least out of the negative.

Wonder what the fire to hire rate is. \n\nAs far as you taking a mental break, why not? My lowlife, piece of shit little brother has been unemployed for 3 months now. Just sits around drinking in someone else's basement (when he's not supposed to have alcohol in the house at all), sleeps all day and plays videogames all night. Guess he's only (beknownst to anyone else) left the house like 5x in 3 months. \n\nSo who's gonna stop ya? If you're able to take a break, might as well. Unless you're highly ambitious and motivated. Then you would probably go crazy doing nothing for more than a couple days or a week before you need to get back out there and climb the ranks.\n\nYeah, it seems i concealed a little rant in here.

I'm a homebody at heart but I work hard because that's what I'm there for. I was reaching my breaking point as mentioned in an earlier comment. I already applied to numerous jobs, but the waiting time inbetween drives me nuts, primarily because of shame than anything else.

But also when you reach 10 upt stop the leaving early or late arrival until it’s back up to 20 atleast. Or just wait until they offer vto . Most sites have an vto interest list you can sign up for at beginning of shift. I would ask about that as well , but stop letting yourself go into negative . If you have important things to take care of get an accommodation but it has to be important reason though. Can’t let easy cash flow get away lol . You may be eligible for rehire in 90 days .

      "# Post ID xiw6o0: I injured myself outside of work, what are my options so that I won’t get fired for negative upt? with +15 score by [(ShyGirl141, Reddit, 2022-09-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/xiw6o0/i_injured_myself_outside_of_work_what_are_my/)\nMy boyfriend and I were playing around wrestling yesterday night and I slipped and fell/ I sprained my wrist and bruised up my side that I fell against the wooden bed frame. I’m hurting very bad and have swelling also. It doesn’t help that I have sciatica already from a previous warehouse job and now I have a bad flare up.  I’ve already had to miss 2 days because I don’t have upt or anything to cover it. So now I have negative upt. I’m honestly hurt and I don’t want to lose my job. What can I do? I need at least a week to recover, I can barely walk.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID ip5dszy with +29 score by [(Rum_zee, Reddit, 2022-09-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/xiw6o0/i_injured_myself_outside_of_work_what_are_my/ip5dszy/) (in reply to ID xiw6o0):\n“Wrestling”\n\n### Comment ID ip5e48y with +18 score by [(ShyGirl141, Reddit, 2022-09-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/xiw6o0/i_injured_myself_outside_of_work_what_are_my/ip5e48y/) (in reply to ID ip5dszy):\nLol my sister and mom said the same thing😅\n\n### Comment ID ip5t5nm with +10 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-09-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/xiw6o0/i_injured_myself_outside_of_work_what_are_my/ip5t5nm/) (in reply to ID ip5dszy):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID ip6et4m with +3 score by [(ShyGirl141, Reddit, 2022-09-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/xiw6o0/i_injured_myself_outside_of_work_what_are_my/ip6et4m/) (in reply to ID ip5t5nm):\nI actually did fall from us wrestling.

Doctors can excuse you from work, Medical reasons  is for a doctor to determine. Not HR  at Amazon. I know in my state we  have multiple different kinds of leave. And some states it's even paid wages. My state it's not paid.  FIRST thing is get to a doctor. Your primary or even urgent care or the ER. Go on your AtoZ app start a LOA case with DLS, you can even just call the ERC and they will start one with or for you. IMO i would  leave out  why you've missed and will be missing some days off work to recover. And  I would leave it very vague on how and why, it's medical and it's personal and that's all they need to know.    Get your excused from work note. At the very least for the shifts that put you in the -UPT.  And upload it on the ERC /DLS. DLS will code your time.  I hope you feel better and I'm sorry your going through all this.  I have  medical accommodations and intermediate time off I can use whenever I need to do so, I have good days and I have horrible days. Well  right now I'm down to 60 hours a month excused I can use as I need to.  My doctor and I reevaluate every six months what I can physically and emotionally am able to handle.\n\n## Comment ID ip67pby with +4 score by [(potatoboat, Reddit, 2022-09-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/xiw6o0/i_injured_myself_outside_of_work_what_are_my/ip67pby/) (in reply to ID xiw6o0):\nYou can take a medical leave of absence; it's not paid. I don't know why another person doesn't know this, but when you sign up for insurance, there are always options for something called long-term and short-term disability. When I worked at Amazon about 3 yrs ago, both options were paid by Amazon and were free, and everyone was enrolled....I think. Anyways, this can cover both at home and at work injuries. Accordingly, you usually receive 60% pay while on disability. It requires you to work with a real hr rep and a doctor, but it's a good option. Or if you've worked there for longer than a year you can take fmla, again you need to work through hr and a doctor but it protects your job and you can't be fired by law. I don't know if you'll have those options available but in the future if you ever have another job and it's a heavy labor job always pay a little more for short and long term disability, usually it's liw cost like anywhere from 5-15$ a pay period. Good luck.\n\n## Comment ID ip6gtgr with +2 score by [(001Vecnussy, Reddit, 2022-09-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/xiw6o0/i_injured_myself_outside_of_work_what_are_my/ip6gtgr/) (in reply to ID xiw6o0):\nGo to the doc and get your accomodations.\n\n## Comment ID ip6ojdj with +2 score by [(DeeWhopp, Reddit, 2022-09-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/xiw6o0/i_injured_myself_outside_of_work_what_are_my/ip6ojdj/) (in reply to ID xiw6o0):\nNothing\n\n## Comment ID ip8hymm with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-09-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/xiw6o0/i_injured_myself_outside_of_work_what_are_my/ip8hymm/) (in reply to ID xiw6o0):\ndo a medical leave they will nine times outta ten they will accept it and it gives you time to go see a doctor and then submit a note in the case from the doctor they gave me up to 15 days to submit my documents\n\n## Comment ID ip97t7q with +2 score by [(jaysteezle, Reddit, 2022-09-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/xiw6o0/i_injured_myself_outside_of_work_what_are_my/ip97t7q/) (in reply to ID xiw6o0):\nYou can do medical leave of absence. I'm coming off of one where I guess I slept wrong and my neck was fucked up and I couldn't turn my head or bend over right. I went to work, told my manager, talked to AmCare and they said they I could come in on breaks for them to apply heat or whatever but I wasn't about to work through it so they took me to HR to get certificate of fitness paperwork and get excused for the night. \nSpoke to ERC the next day about excusing time since I couldn't see my doctor for a week and they transferred me to DLS and they did a medical leave to cover until after my appointment. Worked out well because it took a week for everything to go back to normal and not hurt anymore. If you're scheduled and can make it in you can try the same thing or just call ERC and start it but you'll need to see your doctor to get paperwork filled out clearing you to return to work but it will save you using up your own time.\n\n### Comment ID ipaacw6 with +2 score by [(ShyGirl141, Reddit, 2022-09-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/xiw6o0/i_injured_myself_outside_of_work_what_are_my/ipaacw6/) (in reply to ID ip97t7q):\nI went on the app and requested medical leave from DLS.

Someone will probably call to follow up but you can try and get ahead of it by giving them a call most likely. When you go into the DLS portal you should be able to see your case status and number by using the menu in the upper left. My stuff showed up later the same day I spoke to them on the phone. \n\nDepending on your situation maybe you can get it backdated to cover the time you used if you say you weren't sure how the process worked. I showed up to work to get sent home cause I was worried about my time as well and trying to deal with it after the fact but at least at my site the HR guy I spoke to that gave me the paperwork told me to let him know if my time got messed up from having to wait to see the Doctor and he would go back and excuse me if things didn't line up depending on what happened but it wasn't a big issue since I got excused on the spot then had 2 days off for the leave to get sorted.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID ipan725 with +1 score by [(UnaverageDayTrader, Reddit, 2022-09-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/xiw6o0/i_injured_myself_outside_of_work_what_are_my/ipan725/) (in reply to ID xiw6o0):\nUnfortunately if you’re in negative UPT it’s gonna be hard to fix /: You’re gonna need to file an appeal. Your only shot is talking to HR & explaining your injuries & inability to work however I don’t think they’ll be able to do much because you should’ve gone in & talked to them or at least called right after the injury on your next shift. I kid you not when I worked there I had a day where I was severely sleep deprived, malnourished, & not properly hydrated & was borderline about to pass out. I talked to my manager & then AmCare who told me to eat food, drink electrolytes & sit down so I did for about an hour. Still felt like passing out. Explained this to AmCare again & they told me to see HR. HR Coded me for multiple days which they paid me for & told me to rest up in the meantime & get things sorted so my first day back I feel refreshed and ready to work. First time I ever felt appreciated & well taken care of by Amazon, kinda sad I hadda leave but better opportunities arose.\n\n### Comment ID ipdejbn with +1 score by [(ShyGirl141, Reddit, 2022-09-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/xiw6o0/i_injured_myself_outside_of_work_what_are_my/ipdejbn/) (in reply to ID ipan725):\nThey fixed it.

The third time, my daughter had an allergic reaction in her eye with severe swelling, she needed steroids but the physician refused to write a prescription and advised to use otc meds which we had already tried.

I felt defeated because I did not have the money at the time. I saw my insurance offered this app at $0 cost so I tried it. I’m so glad I did it was super quick and easy to use. We had a short video chat but most of it was by text. The doctor was very nice and helpful. She sent in a lot of useful information. He was diagnosed and sent in a prescription to the pharmacy of my choosing. Now my son can get better thanks to this app and the very appreciated doctors. \n\nIt is a great app to use for adults and parents that are unable to drive or that just is having a hard time being seen by someone same day.

Then there were layoffs and more employees at all levels left on their own. Goals have not changed. More have been added and all dead lines were kept the same. Of course when these deadlines are not met the next company meeting is negative with a lot of general blaming and saying we all just need to work harder. Communication overall has been terrible with \"we don't know yet\" being the usual answer for any concerns. Weeks without answers. Any answers are just as rushed and poorly thought out as the changes. This toxic attitude is starting with the top level but you can see it affecting teams as they feel more pressure.",

I've seen leadership act on feedback given by employees, and continual improvements made in policies and processes, such as our interview process. Leadership and the company doesn't get things right 100% of the time, but they are passionate about making improvements when opportunities arise and when we are put in situations where the company needs to adapt.",

I've seen leadership act on feedback given by employees, and continual improvements made in policies and processes, such as our interview process.

      "# [Celebrating One Year, One Team, One Place – Transcarent](https://transcarent.com/blog/celebrating-one-year-one-team-one-place)\nGlen Tullman, Chief Executive Officer, Transcarent\n\nBuilding great businesses is something that I love to do, and part of that includes knowing when and how to effectively scale. Acquisitions allow companies to grow by incorporating existing innovations, increasing market share, and many times, expanding the workforce for greater impact. In my 30+ years of building businesses, I have led dozens of mergers and acquisitions of all sizes and on both sides of the transaction. Having witnessed many successes and a few pitfalls, I believe that a shared mission and like-cultures are strong determinants of whether or not a transaction will be successful.\n\nI always say that it is easier to fix something, than to start from scratch. So long as the leadership teams who are involved in a transaction share similar values and relentlessly believe that together, they can deliver a better experience for the end user, M&A activity can be incredibly powerful, improve outcomes and business operations, and be a smart investment.\n\nWhen I first met with the team at 98point6, the leader in AI-enabled virtual care, I saw the value their technology, their clinic, and their wildly talented team, could bring to the future of Transcarent and our Members. With experience dating back to 2017 they were forward-thinking, ahead of the curve in healthcare AI, had a robust portfolio of clients and Members, and most importantly, shared a similar mission as Transcarent. Simply put, they were committed to making health and care better for people, including the physicians and others who deliver care and those of us who receive it. They were looking for directional support, commitment, and leadership that would put their technology in the hands of many more people . . . a strength of ours at Transcarent, and we were in search of forward-looking technology that could transform the virtual primary care experience. After our first discussions, the transaction was complete.\n\nOver the past year, our teams came together with the mindset of “one.” One Team. One Mission. One Place for Health and Care. This cultural mindset was ingrained from the start and made for a nearly flawless integration. Yes, we dropped a few balls along the way, but people always knew what our intent was . . . to make this the best place people ever worked and to create an experience of health and care that was new, better, and different than anything else they had come across. I am proud to say we can celebrate one year as one company that has undeniably achieved more together than we ever could have achieved alone.\n\nNothing is more important than our health and care. And no industry will have more impact on our success as a country in the future. However, despite its importance, no industry is more in need of change and improvement. 98point6 made it easy to access care 24x7x365 – easier and faster than ever before – without losing the physician connection. Since acquiring 98point6, we have continued to invest in their revolutionary AI-powered health and care experience. We even had the opportunity to highlight in front of Congress how we are delivering an experience, leading with clinical expertise, from start to finish, that is private and secure, and built to meet and exceed the needs of health consumers. Additionally, we introduced point-of-care navigation capabilities by combining the power of Transcarent's digital platform and benefit ecosystem with virtual care delivery. Expect to hear more from us regarding AI and the ways it will transform virtual primary care visits.\n\nOne of the things we are most proud of is that we are leveraging one of our greatest assets, clinicians, for the part of the visits that require their intellect and experience. Due to the personal nature of this industry, we can’t rely on technology alone. When considering the acquisition with 98point6, their affiliated Physician Group was one of the strongest selling points. The talented and caring physicians, nurses, and other clinicians who comprise the group complete the experience we’re trying to create at Transcarent . . . one that people love, offers high-quality health and care, and does so at a price that people can afford.\n\nWhen we founded Transcarent, we knew the vision of bringing all of health and care, both virtual and in-person, together on a single platform, wasn’t going to be easy or fast. But we’re here, committed as ever, with a steadfast focus on our mission of providing access to high-quality, affordable health and care. We’ve taken the steps necessary, including M&A activity and integrating other innovative solutions into our platform, to build an easy-to-use platform for our Members and clients and company for our employees.\n\nOur work is well underway, we’ve come a long way, but as Bill Gates wisely said, “If I'd had some set idea of a finish line, don't you think I would have crossed it years ago?”\n\nThanks to everyone at Transcarent for your hard work and commitment to making the last year a success.",

      "# [Powered Consumer Health Experience – Transcarent](https://transcarent.com/press-releases/transcarent-introduces-wayfinding-an-ai-powered-consumer-health-experience)\nSan Francisco, CA May 15, 2024 - Today, Transcarent, the One Place for Health and Care, announced WayFinding, a new experience that seamlessly combines generative AI with instant access to care providers to integrate benefits navigation, clinical guidance, and care delivery on one easy to use platform. WayFinding personalizes each person’s experience, orienting and guiding them through their health and care journeys, with human support never more than a tap away.\n\nWayFinding provides Members with personalized support and guidance, beginning with questions about what’s covered and what it might cost. It moves them seamlessly to the next best clinical action to take through specific guidance, and then instantly connects them to medical professionals or provides direct access into digital point solutions uniquely suited to address specific issues.\n\nAccording to a 2023 KFF poll, more than 50 percent of insured adults in America say it is difficult to understand at least some aspect of their health insurance. Forty percent of Americans with employer sponsored coverage said they didn’t understand what their health insurance covers, while 27 percent lacked understanding about specific terms their health insurance uses such as \"deductible,\" \"copay,\" and \"co-insurance.\" Increasing a person’s access to benefits information is critical as uncertainty often leads to unexpected cost, and medical debt is the number one cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. Most Americans find their healthcare to be more confusing, more complex, and more costly than ever before and getting worse, not better, with 70 percent feeling failed by the healthcare system.\n\nWayFinding addresses this complexity, uniquely combining new advancements made possible through generative AI with better information and on-demand access to clinicians, along with access to virtual point solutions and local in-person care. With WayFinding, Transcarent Members can access the care they deserve and employers can be confident their benefits are being used efficiently and effectively.\n\n“Imagine if you could go to one place, 24 hours a day, to access all your benefits, get the unbiased medical guidance you need, and then have instant access to a doctor or other healthcare professional or connect to the leading point solutions with no separate logins and membership cards needed. That’s what we’ve all been dreaming about and today Transcarent is delivering on that vision,” said Glen Tullman, Chief Executive Officer of Transcarent. “This is not just better than traditional navigation, it’s completely different. It’s like moving from a flip phone to an iPhone. The flip phone did one thing. The iPhone does everything. And we’re doing it all at half the price of traditional navigators.”\n\nThe launch of WayFinding builds on Transcarent's earlier work to responsibly incorporate AI-enabled care into the Member experience, starting with the acquisition of the 98point6 care platform, the industry-leading AI-powered care delivery solution, which facilitates immediate access to high-quality, virtual care. Using our database of close to one million documented physician chats, which informs our proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs), paired with significant investments in building an AI team over the last year, Transcarent is set apart from others in the industry. Additionally, Transcarent uses custom testing, validation, and monitoring tools to enable responsible AI development and has built a proprietary multi-pronged safety system that acts as a common safety layer across all our AI products. Our membership in and work with the Data & Trust Alliance has also informed how to use AI safely and securely.\n\nWayFinding is the answer to the challenge of getting people the right information, when and where they need it. It also reduces the burden on human resources and benefits professionals, having to spend hours answering questions from confused employees. WayFinding will drive significant improvements in utilization and engagement.\n\n“WayFinding orients you. By pulling in every detail of an employer’s plan, any offered ancillary benefits, your medical history, and pairing that information with our team of top-rated virtual care clinical specialists, we can create a personalized understanding of each Member’s unique care needs, getting them exactly where they need to be every single time,” said Snezana Mahon, PharmD, Chief Operating Officer of Transcarent. “Your health and care should know you. With WayFinding, that’s now possible. This is the future of navigation and more.”\n\nTranscarent has a proven track record of delivering care experiences that Members value, returning to the experience time and again to meet their health and care needs. Of the Transcarent Members that activate, our 70 percent utilization and retention rates demonstrate that we are delivering on our mission of making it easy to access high-quality, affordable health and care.\n\nClick here to schedule a WayFinding demo.\n\nAbout Transcarent\n\nTranscarent is the One Place for Health and Care.

New York State’s Office of the Attorney General found that CityMD, now part of Walgreens’ VillageMD, improperly billed patients for Covid-19 tests. The $14 million total consisted of canceling $7 million in outstanding testing bills for over 87,000 patients plus refunds of about $7 million to over 215,000 patients who already paid. The CityMD tests were performed between March 2020 and November 2022. Many of the patients received billing up to two years after date of service, with added billing for late charges. In addition, CityMD will pay $95,000 in penalties to the State of New York for the improper billing with an additional fine of $5,000 per incident for any further billing.\n\nFederal and state laws during the Covid-19 public health emergency prohibited providers and health plans from charging co-pays and deductibles for medically necessary Covid-19 testing and related services. CityMD’s website and staff stated that there would be no out-of-pocket costs for testing. There was also no posted cash price for services, violating NYS law. CityMD also refused to correct bills for individuals with previously issued billing. NYSOAG press release\n\nThis follows a $12 million June 2024 civil settlement with the US Department of Justice in the District of New Jersey on false payment claims for Covid-19 testing. The $12.04 million settlement under the False Claims Act resolves CityMD’s claims submitted from 4 February 2020 through 5 April 2022 to the Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA)’s Uninsured Program that covered testing, treatment, and vaccination costs, reimbursing providers at generally Medicare rates. CityMD did not adequately verify that these individuals had health insurance coverage before submitting their claims to the Uninsured Program, including but not limited to individuals for whom CityMD had health insurance cards on file. This then caused downstream filings by labs claiming Uninsured Program payments based on CityMD information. The settlement includes a $2 million whistleblower payment under the False Claims Act to Steven Kitzinger, a patient of CityMD, who informed the clinic that he was fully insured but was told that CityMD would delete his insurance information. He separately sued CityMD. This will at least cover his legal costs ;-) CityMD was credited by the DOJ for their voluntary disclosure, cooperation, and remediation. Healthcare Dive, US Attorney’s Office NJ release\n\nTo be fair, both incidents of improper and fraudulent billing occurred while CityMD was owned by Summit Medical, before Summit’s acquisition by VillageMD, with a Walgreens investment, announced in the palmy days of November 2022 and closing 3 January 2023. But it will be Walgreens doing the payouts where applicable.\n\nWalgreens’ misery level rises some more: Federal court affirms $987M award to PWNHealth/Everly Health. Plus selling $295M in Cencora shares, drawing down to 6%.\n\nWalgreens’ Mound of Misery grows ever higher in two more ways. The US District Court for the District of Delaware ruled yesterday that last year’s arbitration award of $987 million to PWNHealth stands.\n\nWalgreens originally contracted exclusively with PWNHealth’s Everly Health Solutions’ telehealth physician network in April 2020 to order Covid-19 tests that consumers requested through the Walgreens website. PWN/Everly had, with its network, the ability to administer nationwide Covid-19 testing including labs and follow-up. However, Walgreens in 2021 started to divert tests to their own pharmacists, while continuing to use the Everly trademarked logo and displaying that testing would be done by PWN/Everly’s network. This breached the exclusive Master Services Agreement (MSA) with PWN/Everly. Walgreens terminated the MSA effective 1 June 2022. PWN/Everly on 10 June 2022 then initiated the arbitration with the American Arbitration Association alleging breach of contract, a violation of the Latham Act on trademarks, plus additional breaches and violations. In March 2024, the arbitrator awarded PWN/Everly $987 million. This was 12 times the contractually specified $79 million in damages. Arbitration text and decision in Jus Mundi\n\nImmediately after the arbitration, Walgreens filed suit in Delaware to vacate the ruling on the grounds that it contravened the contract’s cap on damages and that the arbitrator’s decision was “egregious and improper”.\n\nThe Federal judge in yesterday’s decision upheld the arbitration decision, finding that the arbitrator had the authority to interpret the contractual language and determine damages. The judge found no evidence that the arbitrator exceeded his authority or showed bias. Walgreens is, of course, appealing the decision in the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In its Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, Walgreens stated that it disagrees with the court ruling but that the appeal may take another two years. “There can be no assurances as to the outcome”. PWNHealth, of course, is “pleased with the court’s well-reasoned decision confirming the arbitration award.” Reuters, Crain’s Chicago Business, FierceHealthcare\n\nWalgreens needs some fast cash. One investment that they have been gradually cashing out is their interest in Cencora, a drug distributor originally called Amerisource Bergen. Last Thursday’s drawdown involved Cencora repurchasing about $50 million worth of its stock from Walgreens, with Walgreens selling about $265 million worth of additional shares. Deducting $20 million in early settlement fees, the net proceeds were $295 million. Walgreens (WBA) states that it will be used primarily for debt paydown and general corporate purposes. WBA’s stake in Cencora has been reduced to 6% from the earlier 10%. Walgreens has been steadily cashing out its Cencora interest with three sales in 2024 totaling 5% of shares [TTA 7 July 2024]. Release, Healthcare Dive, Crain’s Chicago Business\n\nGiven January’s Department of Justice (DOJ) civil suit over improper dispensing of opioids and and other unlawful medications over more than a decade, with possible penalties in the billions, Walgreens’ Mound of Misery is approaching Chicago’s Willis Tower (the former Sears Tower) heights.\n\nTTA February’s New Year: EDITH NHS AI radiology trial, Teladoc buys Catapult, Sword Health to go telemental, Walgreens axes dividends, Veradigm and Evolent off block, 98point6 done?, more!\n\nThe shape of 2025 starts to show with which companies bet, hold, and fold.

Walgreens suspends stock dividends after 91 years. And has Transcarent zeroed out 98point6? (updated)\n\nFebruary is the real opening of the New Year’s Casino. Investors place their bets–and the dealer’s stick clears the losers.\n\nRadAI’s Series C racks up $60 million. The generative AI radiology company gained an oversubscribed round led by Transformation Capital, with participation from existing investors Khosla Ventures, World Innovation Lab, UP2398, Kickstart Fund, OCV Partners, Cone Health and others. It follows a $50 million Series B in May 2024 and boosts the company’s value to $525 million. RadAI’s two products to speed radiology workflows and findings are Rad AI Impressions, their first product, and Continuity for interpretation and follow up for potential new cancers. RadAI claims that their platforms are used by radiologists performing about 50% of all US medical imaging. In July 2024, it partnered with Bayer to bring its capability to Bayer’s Calantic Digital Solution customers. Release, Mobihealthnews\n\nThe niftily named The Helper Bees nabbed $35 million in a Series C. This was a tidy amount for the formerly unsexy independent aging technology sector, led by Centana Growth Partners, with support from Silverton Partners, Impact Engine, Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures, and Alumni Ventures. The Austin, Texas-based company works through 43 health plans (payers) by providing national access to non-medical products and services such as in-home caregiving, home modifications, groceries and meals, pest control, housekeeping, lawn care, and transportation, closing significant care gaps in senior care and enabling aging in place. They support long-term care plans and Medicare Advantage. Their total funding is $54 million. Release, Mobihealthnews\n\nBicycle Health pedals to a $16.5 million raise, profitability. Bicycle’s telehealth platform for opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment has had its downs (a May 2024 layoff of 15% of staff) and ups (a $50 million Series B in 2022). Their latest up is turning profitable on an EBIT­DA and net in­come ba­sis as of Q4. In the middle is the just-announced unlettered down round led by existing investor Questa Capital, with participation from all other existing investors including SignalFire, Frist Cressey Ventures, City Light Capital, InterAlpen Partners, Valeo Ventures, and Hustle Fund, as well as new investor JSL Health. Added to the C-level roster are CFO Manu Kuppalli and COO Andy Thomas, with a background in brick-and-mortar behavioral health. Release, Endpoints, Mobihealthnews\n\nOn the loser’s side of the table\n\nWalgreens suspends their quarterly dividend for the first time in 91 years. The rationale for ending the shareholder payments made since 1933 was announced late last Thursday “as management continues to evaluate and refine its capital allocation policy consistent with the company’s broader long-term turnaround efforts”. The admission was blunt: “The company’s cash needs over the next several years, including with respect to litigation and debt refinancing, were important considerations as part of the decision to suspend the dividend.” The share price promptly took a hit going from $11.43 at market close on Thursday to closing today (Tuesday) at $9.84, not exactly a desired result. Walgreens’ days as a ‘widows and orphans stock’ are long over.\n\nThe litigation is a serious matter, with the Department of Justice (DOJ) filing a civil suit 16 January in Illinois over improper dispensing of opioids and other unlawful medications over more than a decade, in violation of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).\n\nThe WBA Q3, announced mid-January, widened its net loss to $265 million.\n\nWalgreens is in the midst of closing 1,200 locations to get out from under real estate.\n\nThe rest is not much different than other retail–in-store theft, pharmacy sales erosion, and retail sales going online or elsewhere.\n\nMistakes such as buying VillageMD (and doubling down with Summit Health and CityMD) made it 10x worse.\n\nWill this put the brakes on a sale? Certainly Sycamore Partners and other interested parties now must rethink their pricing and timing, though it may be positive if it improves WBA’s cash position. [TTA 10 Dec 2024, 8 January] Release, CNBC, AP\n\nDid Transcarent, after paying $100 million for 98point6’s virtual care platform in 2023, just pull the plug on the service? This tidbit from a commenter on HIStalk News 2/5/25 indicates that Transcarent may have. Exhibit 1 is a notice from Allegheny College (PA), a service customer for about two years, on their blog that students and staff were notified on 19 December that the service was going out of business. The college is searching for a replacement telehealth service. The Allegheny page is also showing up high in Google Search results.\n\nTranscarent has a live 98point6 page with FAQs about the service and buttons for downloads on Google’s and Apple’s respective App Stores. There is no notice on Transcarent’s 98point6 page, but their last blog posting mentioning 98point6 was October 2024. On Google’s App Store, the last update is listed as 5 June 2024, which is unusual for a telehealth app. The app ownership is credited to Transcarent so it is not a leftover from the original company. According to the HIStalk commenter, most staff was laid off by April 2024. (As we reported in our 8 May 2024 report, 98point6 had only 100 on staff, and the number of those laid off was unknown.)\n\nConfusing matters is that 98point6 continues as a platform, but not as a telehealth service. After they sold their virtual care service to Transcarent [TTA 9 Mar 2023], they announced a pivot into licensing its real-time and asynchronous software to third parties, including Transcarent. Less than a year later, 98point6 bought the remaining assets of telehealth provider Bright.md not sold to Evernorth’s MDLIVE–17 asynchronous telehealth provider customers [TTA 19 Jan 2024]. We have reached out to Transcarent’s press office for confirmation. They are welcome to reach out to TTA (email Editor Donna). Update: as of 14 February, there has been no response from their corporate communications folks.\n\nTTA’s January Whirl: Rock Health’s 2024 ‘down round’, Walgreens’ hit with Federal illegal Rx dispensing, UHG investors scoring on denied claims, Masimo’s new CEO, 23andMe ditching Lemonaid, DC changes, more!\n\nWe may be in a deep freeze, but healthcare is heating up.

Acknowledging that HHS expanded Medicare telehealth flexibilities at the start of the pandemic in 2020 in the previous Trump Administration, the American Telemedicine Association’s list is long and detailed.\n\n#1 was to withdraw last week’s Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) proposed rule, “Special Registration for Telemedicine and Limited State Telemedicine Registrations”. This would create a framework for the remote prescribing of controlled substances that in ATA’s view, would create “untenable restrictions and significant barriers to care”.\n\nThe remaining eight include flexibilities that were part of the 2020 rules.\n\nPermanently Allow for the Remote Prescribing of Controlled Substances\n\nWork with Congress to Make Permanent the Medicare Telehealth Flexibilities\n\nEnsure Affordable Telehealth Services for the Commercially Insured\n\nEnsure Affordable Telehealth Coverage for Part-Time, Contracted Workers Who Don’t Qualify for Health Care Coverage\n\nEnsure All Provider Home Addresses Remain Confidential\n\nExpand the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program\n\nReinstate Virtual Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation Programs\n\nRelease Updated Regulatory Guidance on Medicare Telehealth Flexibilities\n\nAdditional details are in the ATA Action letter to President Trump and Vice-President Vance and the ATA release.\n\nAn institutional investor interest group demands a report on delayed and denied care from UnitedHealth Group. This takes the form of a proposal for the 2025 proxy that the UHG board of directors prepare a report on these practices that create increased costs and ‘macroeconomic risks’. The proxy is usually filed in April for a meeting that is typically in June. UHG will respond at that time it files the proxy.\n\nThe group proposing the report is the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR). ICCR represents 300 faith-based institutional investors, such as asset managers, pension funds, and foundations, with over $4 trillion in invested capital. This institutional shareholder action is in the aftermath of the Brian Thompson assassination, which revealed widespread consumer anger about UnitedHealthcare’s practices in high rates of claims denials, including their use of AI in the review process, and prior authorizations to restrict utilization. UHG ignores this at its peril. By the time proxies are released and the shareholder meeting occurs in June, the trial of the assassin may be underway, putting this issue back in top news. ICCR release, Healthcare Dive\n\nWalgreens’ Mound of Misery gained a few hundred cubic yards with a lawsuit filed 16 January by the Department of Justice (DOJ) over improper dispensing of opioids and and other unlawful medications over more than a decade. The civil lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleges that Walgreens and subsidiaries dispensed millions of unlawful prescriptions, violating the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Since Walgreens then sought reimbursement from Federal healthcare programs, they violated the False Claims Act (FCA). The time frame is from August 2012 to the present. Specific allegations include that Walgreens pressured pharmacists to fill prescriptions despite clear ‘red flags’, in excessive quantities, and lacking a legitimate medical purpose and that they ignored the pharmacists and their own internal data. One of the red flags were prescriptions for the ‘trinity’ of an opioid, a benzodiazepine and a muscle relaxant. There are also four different whistleblower actions against Walgreens under the qui tam (on behalf of the government) provisions of the FCA that have been consolidated. If successful, Walgreens could face civil penalties of up to $80,850 for each unlawful prescription filled in violation of the CSA, plus treble damages and applicable penalties for each prescription paid by Federal programs in violation of the FCA. Timing and Walgreens’ response are not yet available. This lawsuit could be a massive stumbling block to the rumored Walgreens/WBA sale. DOJ release, Healthcare Finance\n\nThe VA Secretary nominee recommits to resuming the 2026 rollout of the Oracle Cerner EHR. Former House Representative for Georgia Doug Collins told members of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee at his nomination hearing Tuesday that he would look at the Oracle Cerner EHR deployment with ‘fresh eyes’ and that “there’s no reason in the world we cannot get this done.” On 20 December, the VA formally stated that they were starting planning now for deployment in four Michigan facilities — Ann Arbor, Battle Creek, Detroit, and Saginaw–for implementation by mid-2016. He was critical of what has transpired to date in the limited deployment as ‘not acceptable’ and pointing out that VA facilities needed modernization of their computer systems. But perhaps a little overoptimistically, he’d like to see a faster implementation in 2016, though it should be done properly and not rushed. NextGov/FCW, Healthcare IT News\n\nAnd in the Warp Speed World that is now DC, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is scheduled to testify next Wednesday (29 January) before the Senate Finance Committee on his nomination as Health and Human Services Secretary. At HHS, he would supervise the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). He has promised major reforms including food safety and chemical additives, as well as the relationships between FDA and pharmaceutical companies. Healthcare Dive Meanwhile, during the transition, HHS froze external communications or work-related appearances by staff. This is fairly standard procedure until review procedures are set up, but apparently no one planned for this in advance. This has derailed two conferences (AFCEA HIT Summit and the HHS Industry Summit) that were scheduled for this month and February. Exceptions to this are ‘mission critical’ and emergency communications.

In one of those contradictions that only make sense to Wall Street, Walgreens’s Q1 2025 earnings report, ending 30 Nov 2024 that reported last Friday, was dismal by any reading–but seemed hopeful to market makers who lifted the shares by over 25% as of midday 14 January.\n\nUS retail pharmacy sales and operating losses were the main drags on WBA’s results.\n\nFirst, the highlights from the earnings release:\n\nOperating loss was $245 million, versus $39 million in Q1 2024. The increased loss was due to lower US retail sales and lapping prior year sale-leaseback gains. Another driver was the US Retail Pharmacy Footprint Optimization Program, unexplained in the release.\n\nNet loss was $265 million, versus $67 million in Q1 2024, driven by operating losses.\n\nIt was a dismal quarter for US Pharmacy, which includes the retail stores, despite gains in pharmacy sales of 10.4% due to drug inflation. Retail sales (the front end of the store) decreased 6.2%.\n\nA bright spot was US Healthcare, which includes VillageMD, CareCentrix, and Shields, had a smaller operating loss of $325 million, versus same quarter in FY 2024’s $436 million. VillageMD sales increased 9%, CareCentrix increased 16% and Shields increased 30%.\n\nAnother bright spot was Boots UK’s performance. Their ‘comparable’ pharmacy sales increased 10.9% versus prior year, retail sales 8.1 percent% and grew across all categories. Boots.com sales–22% of total retail sales–were up 30% boosted by Black Friday.\n\nSo why did Mr. Market kvell over this and immediately boost the same shares that fell 63% in 2024? Mostly from the earnings call with CEO Tim Wentworth and other C-levels:\n\nResults beat the Street estimates (LSEG survey):\n\nEarnings per share: 51 cents adjusted vs. 37 cents expected\n\nRevenue: $39.46 billion vs. $37.36 billion expected\n\nGuidance for FY 2025 estimates adjusted earnings per share at $1.40 to $1.80 per share with revenue in the $150 billion range.\n\nCEO Tim Wentworth confirmed that retail locations will continue to close and will accelerate. 70 were closed in Q1 2025.\n\nTheir goal is to close 1,200 locations from 2024 through 2026, with 450 to 500 underperforming locations to shutter in 2025. Walgreens currently has around 8,500 retail locations.\n\nThe sale of VillageMD is underway but no potential acquirers were mentioned on the call. Separately for Summit Health and CityMD, Walgreens is considering “best options” such as sale or restructuring. These units were snapped up by VillageMD in January 2023.\n\nThey are working to turn around retail sales which are declining due to consumers restricting spending due to inflation and the value in using online retailers.\n\nOne measure is around labor scheduling being redesigned to improve the in-store experience. Walgreens is launching a new scheduling model in about 200 locations based on store demand patterns.\n\nIn pharmacy, they plan to roll out digital and virtual check-in for patients plus micro-fulfillment centers for prescription processing.\n\nInterestingly, Walgreens in the US is not promoting online sales–unlike Boots UK which has done well with it.\n\nThere was no comment on the reported consideration of sale to a private equity (PE) firm such as Sycamore Partners [TTA 10 Dec 2024, 8 January], which would remove it from the NYSE.\n\nStreet analysts are boosting the stock now, but state that they need to see a few more quarters of stable performance to feel more confident about WBA’s future. Whether that will happen and that the US retail/pharmacy picture improves is to be determined. HIStalk, CNBC, FierceHealthcare, Healthcare Dive\n\nNews roundup #2: why Walgreens is considering selling to a PE, December fundings, 2024’s surprises, M&A ’25 predictions, Transcarent buying Accolade for $621M\n\nWhy would Walgreens sell out to a private equity investor, reportedly Sycamore Partners? This news leaked early in December to the Wall Street Journal that this PE would either buy Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) in whole, in parts, or with partners [TTA 10 Dec 2024]. This MedCityNews article gathers the speculation from multiple financial executives, and the answer is a resounding Maybe.\n\nPrimary care was a losing bet–and their retail pharmacies are challenged by new models like Amazon Pharmacy and Cost Plus.\n\nIt will take about $9.2 to $10 billion, which is a lot for Sycamore to pony up. But it’s a bargain from what PE giant KKR offered in 2019– $70 billion.\n\nSycamore may have competition for buying WBA.\n\nThe 12,000 store network is now seen not as an asset, but a liability, not only for pharmacy but also for retail goods.\n\nSycamore may be more interested in the retail and e-commerce sides of Walgreens versus healthcare. For instance, WBA company Boots in the UK has leveraged its beauty business to nearly the prominence of health in their stores.\n\nA private company may have more power to swiftly make the changes that Walgreens needs, versus a company having to report quarterly to shareholders.\n\nThere was the usual rush to announce fundings by December’s end, a refreshing change from 2023’s end. MedCityNews helpfully rounded up five of the last-minute closings:\n\nAlready noted: Oura’s $200 million plus funding for a Series D from Dexcom ($75 million) and Fidelity Management. Our earlier reporting noted total financing at $223 million and the valuation at $5 billion.\n\nCleerly’s $106 million Series C led by Insight Partners. Cleerly developed AI-assisted detailed phenotyping of coronary artery disease.\n\nRemodel Health gained $100 million in a funding led by Oak HC/FT and Hercules Capital. Remodel works with employers and employees to build and access Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement (ICHRA) plans.\n\nCala Health raised $50 million from Vertex Growth Fund and Nexus NeuroTech Ventures. Cala is a bioelectronic medicine company which developed FDA-cleared, noninvasive devices for hand tremors.\n\nSoda Health’s $50 million Series B, led by General Catalyst, is in the hot sector of ‘food as medicine’. Soda provides a ‘smart benefits’ card to use at approved retailers for food, health products, and pharmacy benefits.\n\n2024 had its share of surprises in this two-part Mobihealthnews roundup. No surprise for our Readers in that GLP-1 drugs for weight loss went to radioactive-level hot (but this Editor predicts a collapse in 2025). The failure of retail clinics such as Walmart Health and VillageMD surprised many in the industry–as well as Optum shuttering its telehealth business. Developing: menopause and autoimmune health (and their relationship)–and food as medicine. On the insurance side, the troubles of the Medicare Advantage health plan model multiplied, not moderated. And AI? On top of everything, but you maybe shouldn’t develop your own LLM. Part One, Part Two\n\nPredictions for 2025 mergers and acquisitions center on consolidations. There’s little foo-foo or froth in this Mobihealthnews article– instead, lots of New Reality. Many pandemic-born startups will die quiet deaths in sales, shotgun marriages, and shutdowns. Much caution in any M&A. The emphasis is on interoperability, which is widely defined as acquirer-acquiree and a clearly presented integrated value proposition to customers. Their industry leader panel cannot agree whether M&A will accelerate as a result of changes at FTC (Lina Khan’s departure and a new chair) or slow down. And at least one leader believes that Medicare Advantage will stabilize and recover.\n\nBut one buyer plays it high and wide in ’25–the deep-pocketed Transcarent, agreeing to buy Accolade for $621 million in 2025’s First Big Deal. Accolade is also in enterprise care navigation, as well as providing virtual primary care, specialist consultations, and patient advocates. It went public on Nasdaq in 2020. Transcarent’s offer is $7.03 per share in cash, an approximately 110% premium over the company’s closing stock price yesterday 7 January. The funding is coming from General Catalyst (!) and Glen Tullman’s 62 Ventures. Accolade will go private at the closing, expected to be Q2 following shareholder and regulatory approvals, and be integrated into Transcarent. The combined Transcarent will have 1,400 employer and payer clients. Release, Healthcare Dive\n\nBreaking: Walgreens in talks to sell out to PE Sycamore Partners\n\nThe other shoe drops. Clunk. Walgreens Boots Alliance is in talks to sell to private equity firm Sycamore Partners, according to the proverbial “people familiar with the matter” speaking with the Wall Street Journal. The deal could close as early next year.\n\nWBA would exit public markets, where it is currently trading at a little over $10 for a market capitalization just short of $9 billion. Shares rose abruptly at about 1pm Eastern Time (NY).\n\nIt is quite a fall from its value even five years ago at close to $60/share. Other factors are their acquisition binge of latter years including Shields Health and VillageMD, as well as declining brick-and-mortar store sales.\n\nAccording to the article, it would be a very large apple for Sycamore Partners to eat and digest. Sycamore has an aggregate committed capital of approximately $10 billion according to Transacted. It would be likely that some parts of the present Walgreens and WBA would be sold off or partners would be invited in, according to the WSJ’s ‘people familiar…’.\n\nThe house cleaning promised by CEO Tim Wentworth is coming to pass, fast, undoubtedly spurred by Stefano Pessina.\n\nWalgreens is slated to report its next quarterly results on 9 January.\n\nHat tip to Endpoints. One of their reporters contacted Walgreens and received this response: “We don’t comment on rumors or speculation about our business.” a Walgreens spokesperson told Endpoints News.\n\nThis story is developing.\n\nVillageMD’s co-founder/CEO resigns as Walgreens continues the brush-off after billions in losses\n\nWalgreens’ disposition of VillageMD clarifies with CEO/co-founder/board chair Tim Barry’s sudden and unceremonious departure. The news dropped on Wednesday 27 November, directly into the media black hole of the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nA tell-tale sign is that Walgreens’ board has appointed only an interim, VillageMD’s chief operating officer Jim Murray. It is not clear from company statements made to media if Mr. Murray will replace Mr. Barry on the board.\n\nMr. Murray was appointed only last April, having nearly all his experience on the insurance side. He retired from Centene in late March, having come aboard after being COO at Magellan Health when Centene acquired it (now mostly sold off) and with 28 years previously at Humana. [TTA 10 Apr and release] This may suit Mr. Murray, given his age at about 70 (from Centene regulatory filings).\n\nIn a statement to the Chicago Tribune, a Walgreens spokesperson said that “We look forward to continuing to partner with Jim Murray as he assumes day-to-day leadership responsibilities.” (Editor Donna–as if a COO does not already have day-to-day leadership responsibilities?) Murray has been “integral in helping lead the company’s turnaround as VillageMD makes meaningful progress and positions itself for profitable growth.” Neither the Walgreens representative nor VillageMD spokesperson Molly Lynch answered media questions about why Mr. Barry left or the circumstances behind the sudden departure without even a fig leaf (or pumpkin pie) of a cover story or the usual ‘thanks for your service’–which leads to more questions and doubts about What Really Happened.\n\nThe larger picture of sinking Walgreens financials. They closed FY 2024 with an operating loss of over $14 billion, more than doubling FY 2023’s loss of $6.9 billion versus FY 2022’s profit of $1.4 billion during the pandemic. $12.7 billion of a total $13.4 billion impairment was due to VillageMD’s loss in value due to clinic closures, slow patient panel growth, and downward trends in Medicare reimbursement. The remainder of about $332 million was attributed to loss of value in the CareCentrix home care unit (Form 10-K 10 October 2024, document page 123; impairments page 97; also TTA 28 Mar)\n\nThe Big Idea of combining primary care with retail locations in the Roz Brewer/WBA’s Stefano Pessina vision (hallucination?) was a major misstep into a Big Hole.\n\nBad timing was one factor. VillageMD added to a mound of miseries in retail and pharmacy sales caving, competition from direct vendors such as Amazon and Mark Cuban Cost Plus, plus traditional brick-and-mortar CVS and Walmart. There were also expensive settlements around opioid prescribing. VillageMD also tapped Walgreens for $3.5 billion to acquire Summit Medical and CityMD–and defaulted on a $2.25 billion loan in August.\n\nJoining primary care clinics with retail footprints wasn’t based on testing consumer behavior and acceptance–or practice reality. The plan was to have 1,000 joint locations modeled on the picture above left by 2027. As a model, it depended on obtaining both sufficient providers and building loyal patient panels, a slow pull if there ever was one. Physically adding clinic locations to Walgreens’ stores proved to be both expensive and difficult.\n\nThese factors and others sank Roz Brewer’s CEO-dom, the share price, and the vision of Mr. Barry’s and VillageMD’s founders and physicians. The last dated back to 2013 and built into a network of hundreds of freestanding primary care clinics in value-based care. Many of the 140+ closures starting early this year were not only of expansions, but also of long-standing VillageMD offices, including in its core market of Chicago metro. Earlier this year, Cigna wrote off most of its $2.5 billion investment, throwing its Q1 into the red [TTA 2 May].\n\nMany of the practices participated successfully in CMS’ advanced ACO shared savings models starting in 2016 such as Next Generation, Direct Contracting, and the current ACO REACH. The practices integrated telehealth as part of their value-based care models to achieve quality metrics. In CY 2023, VillageMD-operated ACO entities in the REACH model achieved $140 million in gross savings for Medicare, with $36 million shared back with the government and the remainder reinvested in the care model. (CMS reports are released 10-12 months after the prior year’s end.) 12 November release\n\nWalgreens went big–and was sent home with the metaphorical tail between the hind legs. Perhaps engraved on VillageMD’s headstone will be what Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth said of VillageMD during the Q4 earnings call in October, “… We’ve declared it’s not a crucial part of our future.” Mr. Wentworth and the board declared months ago that they wished to sell all or part of the business, at least below their majority holding at 63% [TTA 8 Aug, 2 July] Who even wants to or is able to buy, with Walmart Health defunct and Oak Street Health and One Medical retrenching for their respective owners? Will VillageMD be part of anyone’s future? Healthcare Finance News, Healthcare Dive\n\nWeekend reading: 23andMe’s up in the air future, including genetic data; Walgreens debates What To Stop and Start; what if healthcare pursued a zero-failure rate?\n\nWhile 23andMe figures out a future….what happens to the genetic data? Troubled 23andMe today announced that it will be reporting its FY2025 Q2 numbers next Tuesday 12 November. An interesting part of their release is that shareholders can submit and upvote questions to management via the Say Technologies portal–and they’re blistering. They ask about the plan for recovery (132 votes, 60K shares represented), whether the company will be sold off piecemeal (128 votes, 73.5K shares) and a sale of the company (78 votes, 47.8K shares. Also questioned (38 votes, 3.4K shares): the addition of three new board members, none of whom have biopharmaceutical experience as all former CFOs outside of healthcare. These replace the seven that ankled on 17 September [TTA 17 Sept].\n\nTo Wojcicki, of course, with her reported 49.99% of voting control, shareholders’ questions aren’t really going to matter. Whether they will be addressed on Tuesday is anyone’s guess.\n\nMany 23andMe customers have questioned how to remove their personal genetic data from their database, which if en masse will reduce the value of the company. This TechCrunch article explains how that data is not covered by HIPAA privacy regulations, but 23andMe’s own retention rules.\n\nIf 23andMe sells, the data goes with it. If there is no sale, apparently recent Wojcicki statements indicate that the model going forward for the company is the sale of that data to pharma developers and researchers, ditching its independent drug discovery, and moving into telehealth prescribing of GLP-1 drugs through its Lemonaid subsidiary.\n\nFor those concerned about their privacy, or wary of a change of ownership, accounts can be easily deleted–but not the genetic information. TechCrunch gives how to delete your account–but apparently that won’t delete your genetic information, date of birth, and gender. 23andMe will also retain limited personal information attached to your account for an undefined time. Individuals can also reverse their consent for sharing that information with researchers, but cannot remove it. 12 million people have reportedly given consent–deliberately or not. A real lesson on oversharing for millions–if they care.\n\nWhat can Walgreens reasonably stop or reverse in its multiple series of Bad Decisions? A short interview at HLTH with US Healthcare head Mary Langowski indicates that there’s not much that hasn’t been already announced. We know that VillageMD is shuttering locations and is up for sale. 1,200 retail locations will be closed over the next three years. But what else to stop? “A lot of what I’ve fo­cused on in the first six months, is re­al­ly, it’s okay to stop stuff. What are we gonna stop?” While it’s totally fine to fail ‘at some things’, these weren’t small fails. Wentworth is concentrating on the new chief commercial officer selling Wal­greens’ ser­vices to pay­ers, providers, and life sci­ence com­pa­nies, such as clinical trials capabilities, CareCentrix, and Shields Health. There’s also some push towards “build­ing a stand­alone phar­ma­cy busi­ness rather than a ver­ti­cal­ly in­te­grat­ed busi­ness”. Endpoints News\n\nThinking about if healthcare adopted a ‘zero-failure’ rate. Michael Alkire’s (CEO, Premier Inc., a health system operational improvement provider) daughter was on Alaska Airlines’ Flight 1282 on 5 January 2024. That was the Boeing 737-9 MAX flight that had a blowout of a mid-cabin exit door plug placed there instead of an emergency exit door. The blowout was due to four improperly installed (loose) bolts. It occurred at 16,000 feet and the lower altitude, combined with no one seated in that row, contributed to a 100% survivability rate and a successful landing, though passengers were injured. Anyone with an interest in aircraft knows that one little thing, like a worn jackscrew on a rudder or an untightened bolt, can lead to a non-survivable crash.\n\nMr. Alkire’s point is that we should be striving, as the airlines and aircraft manufacturers have done (which failed in this case) for zero failure in healthcare. He cites the well-known statistic that 98,000 people die each year from medical errors. We don’t have a culture of continuous performance improvement. For one, clinical innovations can take nearly two decades to become standard practice. Yet it works. Simple things, such as clinical surveillance in nursing homes, can reduce adverse drug events by 92%. Much more to ponder in this Influencer contribution to MedCityNews. (And Boeing has a long way to go to restore trust–buying back Spirit AeroSystems, the former Boeing Wichita, is a necessary start they are finally making.)\n\nNews roundup 16 Oct: Walgreens shuts 1,200 stores–500 in ’25, CVS exiting core infusion biz, Masimo v. Apple update, DEA recommends 3rd telehealth extension, Change hack costing UHG $705M, Owlet back in NYSE compliance\n\nA roundup of chickens coming home to roost? But some chickens are just happy to come home.\n\nWalgreens’ Mound of Misery just grew a little higher. The headlines today were all about Walgreens’ closing 1,200 stores over the next three years. Their current store location roster is about 9,000, according to their website. 500 of these will be closed during their upcoming FY2025. Their release stated this would be “immediately accretive to adjusted EPS and free cash flow”. (Were they making any money at all?) This helped to give their share price a nice bump from $9 to above $10 at market close today. Last year, Walgreens’ shares were priced above $22.\n\nQ4 (closing 31 August) closed with a 6% boost in retail sales. However, losses were $3.0 billion versus a net loss of $180 million in the prior year’s Q4. The reasons cited in their release were a higher operating loss, a $2.3 billion non-cash charge for valuation allowance on deferred tax assets primarily related to opioid liabilities recognized in prior periods, and a non-cash impairment charge related to equity investment in China. The operating loss related to a non-cash goodwill impairment charge for CareCentrix.\n\nThe full year was not cheery. Sales were $147.7 billion, an increase of 6.2% from a year ago (in constant currency, 5.7%). But losses in their FY2024 were $14.1 billion, a stunning increase of 104.5% compared to prior year.\n\nVillageMD is being monetized along with other assets. “CEO Tim Wentworth said in the earnings call that the company is focused on “monetizing non-core assets to generate cash,” naming VillageMD as an example, to focus on its core retail pharmacy business.” HIStalk 16 Oct Can Walgreens shrink itself to profitability? Fierce Healthcare\n\nOver at CVS, they’re doing their own shrinking. CVS is closing its core infusion services business, with plans to either close or sell 29 related regional pharmacies. Infusion services were bought from Coram LLC in 2013 for $2.1 billion. This Reuters exclusive was based on an 8 October memo and confirmed by a CVS press representative. Patients relying on antibiotics, drugs supporting muscular health, and intravenous nutrition services will be transferred to other providers. CVS will continue to provide certain services: specialty medications and enteral nutrition, or tube feeding, at pharmacies in Minnesota, Pennsylvania and San Diego, with nationwide nursing services. Hat tip to HIStalk 16 Oct.\n\nMasimo wins one big patent challenge, loses one (or four), to Apple.\n\nThe Win: Apple had sued Masimo in the US District Court of Delaware for patent infringement of Apple’s utility patent 10,942,491 B2 (“the ‘491 patent”). Masimo was charged as violating Apple’s patent on 19 features. Masimo appealed to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for an inter partes review (IPR) of the patent on the grounds of ‘unpatentability’, a very high proof. Masimo succeeded in this, rendering Apple’s ‘491 patent useless. Apple can appeal but the likelihood of success against the PTAB ruling that required three administrative patent judges to review, at this level of proof, is low. In this Editor’s view, this may spur other developers to come up with innovations now that these 19 features have been deemed unpatentable.\n\nThe Loss (I think): In review in the Delaware District Court are four complicated lawsuits between the two combatants, with Apple’s premise that Masimo has infringed upon other patents. Masimo alleged “inequitable conduct” by Apple in their patent filings with the PTO, essentially alleging fraudulent filings on multiple patents. Apple has been granted a summary judgment on Masimo’s claims, throwing them out.\n\nInterestingly, Masimo–never shy to announce wins versus their foe Apple under the prior leadership of Joe Kiani–has remained strangely mum. (Perhaps everyone is waiting for the takeover dust to settle?) Will the ‘new’ Masimo be so combative against Apple? A far more detailed analysis for the patent mavens is in Strata-gee. A very large hat tip and bow to their editor, Ted Green, who writes about marketing primarily in the audio/visual business but has been 100% on top of The Masimo Saga–thank you!\n\nTo no one’s surprise, DEA kicks the telehealth waiver can down the road–for the third time. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) sent to the White House’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a proposed rule to extend telehealth prescribing of Schedule II and higher controlled substances without changes. These waivers which removed the in-person examination requirement under the Ryan-Haight Act were instituted during the Covid pandemic and extended twice [TTA 11 Oct 23, 11 May 23] with a final expiration of 31 December 2024. In September, reports indicated that DEA not only wanted to restore prior restrictions but also wished to introduce additional ones. However, their timing (September!) given Federal standards of publishing draft rules and lengthy comment periods before a final rule was impossible to be achieved by year’s end. [TTA 13 Sept]\n\nWhether OMB will approve the extension (to a date that cannot be confirmed since the text is unavailable, but reportedly one year) is not certain, as it may be disputed by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Since the waiver is due to expire at the end of the year, this may help to assure the multitude of mental health and other telehealth companies dependent on legal remote diagnosis and prescribing controlled substances that their businesses can continue. FierceHealthcare\n\nUHG didn’t have a happy quarter either due to Change. The total hit to UnitedHealth Group of the Change Healthcare hack is now estimated at $705 million, or 75 cents a share. Their 2025 guidance on profit is a lackluster $30 per share–below Wall Street estimates of $31.18. Government plans’ cuts in payments for Medicare Advantage plus and low state payment rates for Medicaid are affecting UHG as well as nearly every other payer. UHG’s share price on the news reacted negatively, falling 9% and dragging down other payers as well. UHG must rue the day they bought Change Healthcare, as it has been largely bad news ever since. CNBC\n\nAnd winding up on a happy note–Owlet is back in good graces with the NYSE. Last year, they faced a NYSE notification that they were out of compliance with the $50 million minimum valuation of the company over a consecutive 30-day trading day period. They are now in compliance and their Class A shares can trade without the ‘BC’ black mark and no longer be listed as such on the NYSE website. The NYSE will be following its standard procedure of a 12-month follow-up on compliance. Release, Mobihealthnews\n\nThe baby sock and baby monitoring company has had a rough couple of years between a cracked SPAC (2021), FDA notifying them at the end of 2021 that they considered the Smart Sock a medical device, forcing the company to pull it from distribution [TTA 4 Dec 21], mounting losses, layoffs, and rebuilding with an FDA-cleared BabySat and enhanced Dream Sock [TTA 21 June 23]. Usually, this concatenation of events means the company either shuts or sells, but Owlet has done neither and bootstrapped itself. Revenue in their Q2 ending 30 June was up 58% year over year with a narrower operating loss of $2.2 million, compared with $6.7 million in prior year. It recently expanded their European distribution of the Dream Sock after CE Mark certification in May to a total of 11 countries [TTA 18 Sep].\n\nWhat’s next for: Steward CEO now in criminal contempt of Congress; Walgreens’ Pessina’s fortune vanishes by 97%; Masimo’s Kiani now a man without a company\n\nSenate unanimously votes to hold Steward Health CEO in contempt. The resolution passed on Wednesday 25 September refers the contempt charges against Dr. Ralph de la Torre, the CEO of Steward Health, to the Department of Justice (DOJ). The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) voted on 19 September to recommend two contempt charges–criminal and civil–to the full Senate. It is the first time since 1971 that a criminal contempt charge has been passed. The DOJ’s actions can include prosecution by the District of Columbia’s US Attorney which can mean arrest and possible incarceration, with a fine that doesn’t exceed $100,000, or civil contempt which usually involves a fine and another subpoena to appear. FierceHealthcare, Becker’s\n\nThe threatening language of the HELP committee members such as Bernie Sanders and Ed Markey surely did not encourage de la Torre or his legal counsel to appear on 12 September, with the anger across the board among all members regardless of party. All that it promised to be was, in street language, the worst kind of beatdown. Formally, the appearance was rejected because of Steward’s bankruptcy in adjudication in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas supervising the sale of Steward assets. There is also a court order that prevents de la Torre from commenting during the sale process. To the press, his legal counsel depicted the HELP committee hearing as “a pseudo-criminal proceeding in which they use the time, not to gather facts, but to convict Dr. de la Torre in the eyes of public opinion.” TTA 14 Sept\n\nSteward Health’s spectacular collapse opens even more Pandora’s Boxes for de la Torre. He possibly faces additional lawsuits attempting to ‘pierce the corporate veil’ to claw back his bank and personal, sizeable maritime and aviation assets–or hold him criminally liable, far more complicated, long-term, and damaging. A cynical view would be that de la Torre would be well advised to get on his $40 million yacht or one of his private aircraft–and depart for a destination that is reluctant to extradite to the US.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance’s troubles drastically shrink executive chairman Stefano Pessina’s personal fortune. Chairman Pessina, who holds 17% of WBA stock and is the single largest shareholder, has seen his holdings shrink in value by 97%, from $12 billion in 2015 to a current $1.3 billion, according to Bloomberg data. The 83-year-old WBA head has seen hard times before. He pulled a rabbit out of the proverbial hat in 2007 by going private with Boots and then merging it with Walgreens in 2015, but time and Mr. Market are not on his side with taking on the debt load necessary.\n\nIs WBA or Walgreens attractive to an acquirer? With stock trading at a record low of around $8 and a market capitalization of about $7.5 billion, it may be a bargain if an investor ignores or doesn’t blanch at the debt load. But those who understand the business cannot buy due to US antitrust regulations, which rules out any retail competitor or PBM. Or the company could be parted out to healthcare providers or a health insurer, but that ignores their miseries, such as reduced Medicare Advantage reimbursements. Their mistakes such as VillageMD and unprofitable locations are in the middle of being worked out and the company is shrinking. Meanwhile, their 15 October full-year earnings report will be dripping with red ink, as their Q1-3 lost $314 million versus prior year earnings of $1.2 billion. Crain’s Chicago Business\n\nVanishing for Joe Kiani is his day job at Masimo after a dramatic proxy fight. The founder of the audio and health monitor company was voted out of his board seat by shareholders. He followed by resigning as CEO after founding the company 35 years ago. Michelle Brennan, a board member (from Politan) has been appointed as interim CEO. Previously, she was a senior executive at Johnson & Johnson’s companies, including international experience in business development, for over 30 years. She also is on the board of Cardinal Health. Korn Ferry is coordinating the search for a permanent CEO.\n\nThe proxy battle wasn’t even close, according a CNBC report reported by Strata-gee. Quoting an inside source, the Politan slate of two directors, Darlene Solomon and William Jellison, received twice as many votes as Joe Kiani and Christopher Chavez on the Masimo slate.\n\nThe company is continuing ‘strategic alternatives’ (read: sale) of its consumer health and audio businesses, the latter mostly acquired in the utterly snakebit 2022 acquisition of Sound United’s consumer audio brands. Masimo is using Centerview Partners and Morgan Stanley as financial advisors and Sullivan & Cromwell as a legal advisor. Presumably, the Kiani-arranged sales to or joint ventures of these units with unnamed investors is off. Masimo will be retaining their professional healthcare and pulse oximetry products. For Q3 2024, Masimo reiterated its financials from early August, with earlier guidance here.\n\nWhether others will depart with Kiani is too soon to tell. During the proxy fight in July, Masimo’s chief operating officer, Bilal Muhsin, promised to resign if Kiani was forced out, specifically citing that he would refuse to work with Quentin Koffey, a Masimo director and chief investment officer of Politan Capital. Other managers signed similar letters around the same time. However, in the Masimo release on the Kiani resignation, financials, and management changes, CFO Micah Young and Muhsin stated that would provide more details on an earnings call in October.\n\nThe Strate-gee view was that shareholders got tired of hearing promises about Sound United and that Kiani was high-handed with them–treating it as his personal company and not theirs. Healthcare Dive\n\nRounding up follow ups: Walgreens shareholder suit on pharmacy performance, Steward CEO no-shows Senate committee, Masimo-Politan proxy fight has court win for Politan–vote on for 19 September\n\nAnother shovelful topping Walgreens’ Mound of Misery. Filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, this shareholder lawsuit points to the poor performance of Walgreens’ pharmacy division. The fault is assigned to Walgreens management, specifically CEO Tim Wentworth and CFO Manmohan Mahajan plus 10 other executives including chairman Stefano Pessina, in overstating the division’s performance between 12 October 2023 to 26 June 2024 . It charges that they “falsely and materially claimed confidence in the brand inflation, volume growth, cost execution, discipline, and overall contributions of [Walgreens’] pharmacy division”, leading to an overvaluation of Walgreens’ share price. In addition, Walgreens “veiled the reality: that (Walgreens’) pharmacy division was not actually equipped to adapt to ongoing hurdles within the industry”.\n\nThe shareholder is Mark Tobias, a shareholder since late 2022. Key to the suit is the 12 October 2023 earnings conference call that contained positive comments about the pharmacy operation made by Wentworth, new at that time to Walgreens, and Mahajan. Their tune changed by the 27 June 2024 conference call where they admitted that the pharmacy model was “not sustainable”. Walgreens’ share price on 12 October 2023 was $24.19. As of 4pm New York time today, 13 September, Walgreens closed at $9.21.\n\nFrom the Crains Chicago Business article, the lawsuit demands restitution and reforms:\n\nWalgreens should be awarded damages and restitution from the individual defendants\n\nThe company and defendants take steps to reform and improve corporate governance and internal procedures\n\nThose reforms may include\n\nStrengthening the board’s supervision of operations\n\nPermitting Walgreens shareholders to nominate at least five candidates for election to the board\n\nEnsure the establishment of effective oversight of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations\n\nThe Crains article also includes a Scribd copy of the filing. Also Healthcare Dive\n\nAnother very large Mound of Misery buried Steward Health…but CEO Ralph de la Torre doesn’t plan to comply with a Senate committee subpoena. His testimony before the Senate’s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee was scheduled for 12 September but last week on 4 September, his attorneys informed the committee that Dr. de la Torre would not appear. They cited the ongoing US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas sale of Steward assets (Healthcare Dive update) and a court order that silences him from comment during the sale process. The committee, chaired by Senator Bernie Sanders, is also accused by the CEO’s attorneys of using the bankruptcy and de la Torre’s marine possessions (a $40 million yacht and $15 million fishing boat) and private jets as “a pseudo-criminal proceeding in which they use the time, not to gather facts, but to convict Dr. de la Torre in the eyes of public opinion.”\n\nThe committee plans to decide on 19 September among two options: whether Dr. de la Torre will be brought up on criminal contempt charges that would be referred to the District of Columbia US Attorney, or civil contempt which usually involves a fine and another subpoena to appear. Several Senators on the committee–Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Edward Markey–have called de la Torre’s no-show “outrageous”. Sanders has issued threats of de la Torre being held accountable for his greed, but exactly how much of this is for the press and what the committee will do is unclear. More of concern to the CEO would be whether further lawsuits would attempt to ‘pierce the corporate veil’ and claw back his bank and personal assets–or hold him criminally liable. Healthcare Dive, AP\n\nThe ugly Masimo-Politan Capital proxy fight continues–with a win for Politan. The attempt by Masimo, a consumer audio company that branched out into professional healthcare and pulse oximetry products–and last year won a big patent infringement decision against Apple on pulse oximetry—to further postpone a shareholder vote on giving control to activist shareholder Politan Capital ended in a loss yesterday. The US District Court, Central District of California denied Masimo’s request for a preliminary injunction to block Politan’s nominees for the Masimo board. Unless Masimo’s motion asking the same court to find Politan in contempt due to breaking the court’s sealing order on the decision, and the court grants a further delay, the shareholder vote will be held next Thursday 19 September. The likely outcome, according to Strata-gee which is covering this from the consumer audio perspective, is that shareholders will turn the board over to Politan by electing their representatives to the two open seats, booting CEO Joe Kiani–and total corporate chaos will ensue. Strata-gee has all the gory details. Background in TTA 8 August and prior.",

      "# [Compassionate Cancer Care: How Employers Can Support Both Patients and Caregivers by Zoë Harte, the University of Exeter on 2024-10-09](https://www.springhealth.com/blog/employer-cancer-care-support)\nThere's one word that can instantly change someone's life and the lives of those who love them: cancer.\n\nIt's a diagnosis that affects millions of people globally, touching not just individuals, but entire families and communities. As HR leaders and employers, we have a unique opportunity—and responsibility—to support our team members through this challenging journey.\n\nThat’s why at Transcarent, we're here for our Members every step of the way through cancer. We've recently teamed up with Spring Health to bring top-notch mental health support right into our platform.\n\nWhy? We believe people deserve a community of care that truly understands what they’re going through and offers the very best support during what might be the most difficult period of their lives.\n\nThe need for comprehensive support\n\nAfter spending more than 25 years in human resources, including my current role as Chief People Officer at Transcarent, I've seen firsthand how cancer impacts our workforce. I also understand this issue on a deeply personal level. Both of my parents passed away from cancer in recent years.\n\nSomething I took away from those experiences is that every cancer journey is unique, and transformative. The complexity of decisions—from treatment options to finding caregiver support—can be overwhelming.\n\nIt’s difficult to know what the correct course of action should be in the middle of this complexity. What treatment regime should you follow? As a caregiver, how do you get support for your own mental health while holding up the person going through treatment? Is it possible to balance work and treatment or caregiving?\n\nThe whole person shows up at work\n\nGone are the days when we understood our \"work selves\" and \"real lives\" as separate. The past few years have highlighted a simple but profound truth: we bring our whole selves to work.\n\nAs HR leaders, we have the privilege and responsibility to support all aspects of our employees' lives, including their most vulnerable moments.\n\nI’ve had employees share cancer diagnoses and fertility challenges with me, needing to understand their benefits before talking to their families. This level of trust is a gift, and we must be prepared to honor it.\n\nA holistic approach to cancer support\n\nWhen we talk about cancer care, there’s more to it than scans and treatments. Care is also about supporting mental health and lifting up the unsung heroes—caregivers. Yet mental health often takes a backseat.\n\nGlobally, depression among those with cancer is estimated to be 27%. Other research suggests that 35-40% of people with cancer have a diagnosable mental health challenge affecting their quality of life.\n\nThe ups and downs take a toll on mental health\n\nCancer can be the most terrible emotional roller coaster, parked directly in the middle of a family's life.\n\nWhen my dad was living with cancer, there were times when we thought he’d be okay and that we’d have years left with him. And that would change, week to week, day to day, before he passed. His experience was completely different from my mum’s, who had cancer and dementia. One thing both experiences had in common is that the mental health of our family and support system was deeply challenged.\n\nNo employee should have to choose between treating their body or mind—both are essential for healing, which is why holistic support is so necessary.\n\nIn the sections that follow, we'll explore specific ways to implement a holistic support system, ensuring that no employee faces cancer alone.\n\nComprehensive support throughout the cancer journey\n\nSo, what might comprehensive support look like?\n\nAt Transcarent, we support people through every phase of their cancer journey, from screening through initial diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship. When a Member first reaches out, we discuss their diagnosis, staging, and treatment options. Our Oncology Nurse Navigators provide education, expertise, and, most importantly, compassionate support.\n\nI spoke with Nicole Reimer, Transcarent’s Director of the Oncology Nurse Navigator program for this blog. She’s been an Oncology Nurse for over 30 years and shared an insightful example of how we provide support for employees:\n\n\"Sometimes our Members want to speak with their Oncology Nurse Navigator every day for support, especially those facing challenges as caregivers. This is what we’re here for—to connect with and educate people so they feel confident in taking the next step.”\n\nAddressing mental health: a key component of cancer care\n\nWe begin each new Member intake by explaining the NCCN distress thermometer, which assesses the person’s current state and identifies specific sources of distress, whether financial difficulties, fear, or other factors. Understanding the root causes of anguish is essential to addressing it effectively.\n\nFor people undergoing cancer treatment and their caregivers, we always ask:\n\nHow are you coping with this?\n\nWhat is your support system?\n\nWhat helps make it better?\n\nWhat specific things do you need help with?\n\nBased on their responses, we create a personalized plan that may consist of comprehensive mental health support, including an Employee Assistance Program (EAP). We can also connect them with mental health experts who can provide guidance, a listening ear, and evidence-based coping strategies.\n\nTaking care of the caregivers\n\nIt's highly likely that employees within your organization work full-time, care for a family member with cancer, raise children, and/or support other dependents.\n\nCaregivers of people with cancer are often overlooked when it comes to mental health support. While the focus naturally centers on the person with cancer, it's crucial to remember that caregivers need support too—not just for their own well-being, but to be better equipped to care for their loved ones.\n\nAs Nicole pointed out, \"Taking care of the caregiver is not selfish. In order for someone to be the most effective caregiver, they have to take care of themselves.\"\n\nThe need for caregiver support is significant. A recent meta-analysis showed that about 42% of for cancer caregivers experience depression. This statistic underscores the importance of extending workplace support to this often-overlooked group.\n\nInterestingly, Nicole has observed a shift in who's reaching out for help: \"Every day, I’m speaking to caregivers who are so grateful to have this resource.\" This trend highlights the growing awareness of caregiver needs and the importance of addressing them.\n\nThe phrase \"you cannot pour from an empty cup\" may be overused, but it's profoundly true in this context. When I think about my own experiences as a caretaker, I imagine a pressure valve: without proper mental health support and self-care, the stress, anxiety, and depression of caregiving can build up and cause harm. There needs to be a healthy form of release.\n\nWhat can employers do?\n\nNormalizing asking for help and allowing people space to care for themselves at work can make a world of difference. As I experienced during my parents' illness, the humanity and support of team members can be invaluable during difficult times. Nicole pointed out, “My conversations with people illustrate that individual managers have a bigger impact than employers on the lives of employees with cancer.\"\n\nOften, support can be as simple as managers listening, being engaged, and asking, \"How can I support you and the people you love right now?\"\n\nHere are other concrete steps organizations can take:\n\nEnsure employees understand the benefits available concerning cancer care.\n\nOffer a dedicated cancer care solution.\n\nOffer comprehensive mental health support.\n\nProvide schedule flexibility for both those undergoing treatment and caregivers.\n\nPromote a supportive culture that openly discusses mental health.\n\nMake a public commitment to supporting employees with actions like signing the Working with Cancer pledge.\n\nDirect employees toward resource groups, mentorship, and survivorship support networks.\n\nReturning to work after treatment\n\nThe need for support doesn't end when treatment is over. Returning to work after cancer treatment brings its own set of challenges, particularly regarding mental health. It's not as simple as \"You're better, so get back to work.\" Reentry can be challenging and non-linear, which is both normal and okay.\n\nThe key is to give employees agency over their return whenever possible. Ask questions like, \"How do you want to handle reentry? What do you want me to tell your team members about your return to work?\"\n\nEmployees may need ongoing support, including:\n\nGradual return to full-time work\n\nContinued scheduling flexibility\n\nMental health support\n\nAccess to survivorship programs\n\nRegular check-ins with their manager and HR leader\n\nThis level of support is particularly crucial in the first year after treatment.\n\nExtending compassionate care\n\nWhat I want HR and benefits leaders to remember is that cancer's impact extends beyond the person diagnosed. Your caregiving employees are carrying heavy burdens. By embracing both groups with strong, thoughtful support systems, you're not only helping individuals—you’re building a workplace where empathy and resilience can thrive.\n\nOffering compassionate, comprehensive cancer care isn't just the right thing to do—it's also an investment in your most valuable asset: your people. When you support your team through life's toughest challenges, they'll go above and beyond for you in return.",
      "# [Members eliminate medications and see significant, sustained weight loss on its Type 2 diabetes reversal program through Virta Health](https://www.banneraetna.com/en/about-us/news/type-2-diabetes-reversal-program-through-virta-health.html)\nIn one year, members eliminated 66% of diabetes medications through the personalized, nutrition-first approach\n\nPhoenix, AZ (August 28, 2024): Banner|Aetna, a joint venture health plan owned by Banner Health and Aetna, a CVS Health company, announced one-year member outcomes from its diabetes reversal program powered by Virta Health, a leader in diabetes reversal and sustainable weight loss.\n\nAfter just six months, Banner|Aetna members saw transformational health outcomes.

      "# [Expert Tips For High Availability Through Workload Orchestration by Expert Panel® on 2024-12-02](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/12/02/expert-tips-for-high-availability-through-workload-orchestration/)\nMaintaining a seamless, uninterrupted user experience is central to effective workload orchestration. With today’s tech environments spanning on-premises and cloud networks, diverse teams, and connected devices, flexible and well-considered strategies are essential.\n\nIt’s a complex challenge, and expert advice can be invaluable. Below, members of Forbes Technology Council share their experience and advice for developing an effective workload orchestration system. Tap into their expertise to help your team deliver reliable, optimized services and an excellent user experience.\n\n1. Integrate Multicloud Platforms With Automated Failover\n\nBy integrating multicloud platforms with automated failover mechanisms, workloads can dynamically shift from one cloud provider to another in the event of an outage, ensuring minimal downtime. This also allows for the application of load balancing techniques that dynamically distribute traffic across multiple regions, ensuring optimal performance while preventing overload on any single node. - Bhaskar Gangipamula, Quadrant Technologies\n\n2. Combine Workload Distribution With Monitoring And Recovery\n\nThe strategy should include two parts. First, have workloads distributed across multiple availability zones to ensure high availability. Second, have monitoring and recovery systems in place that include prompt alerts, self-healing capabilities and regular backups. - Ravi Laudya, SAP Concur\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify?\n\n3. Leverage Container Orchestration\n\nA strategy for high availability and fault tolerance is to use container orchestration tools like Kubernetes. These tools split your app into smaller containers distributed across multiple servers. If one server fails, Kubernetes automatically shifts the workload to the other, healthy containers, ensuring minimal downtime and uninterrupted service—like a backup system that keeps everything running smoothly. - KJ Dhaliwal, Lotus Health AI\n\n4. Set Up Autonomous AI Agents\n\nAutonomous AI agents provide real value by analyzing patterns in system logs, performance metrics and error rates. They can proactively detect issues before they result in downtime. By identifying anomalies and predicting potential failures, these agents can trigger preventive actions, such as scaling resources, rerouting traffic or spinning up services, to ensure high availability. - Manjula Iyer, 98point6 Technologies\n\n5. Consider This Three-Step Approach\n\nHaving built a high-availability and fault-tolerant VoIP soft switch, we took three major steps. First, we deployed across multiple cloud providers to eliminate outages caused by underlying data center failures. Second, end-user devices were registered to different nodes, preventing the entire site from experiencing issues. Lastly, we utilized active-active environments that are always in sync, allowing us to reprioritize traffic in real time. - Hamed Mazrouei, Milagro\n\n6. Validate Your Availability And Fault Tolerance In Noncrisis Situations\n\nThere is no substitute for validating your high availability and fault tolerance strategy on a regular basis in noncrisis situations. Make needed adjustments during these validation periods to improve the durability of your solution. A best practice would be to spend the appropriate amount of time up front designing the strategy and then validating it with current operations to make updates as required. - Russ Kennedy, Nasuni\n\n7. Use A Hybrid Setup\n\nAn effective strategy is using a multicloud or hybrid setup. This spreads workloads across different cloud providers, reducing the risk of downtime. Combine this with auto-scaling and load balancing, which adjust resources based on demand, and use automation to detect and fix issues early, keeping systems running smoothly without manual intervention. - Ehsan Ahmadi, Vox Solutions\n\n8. Leverage A Microservices-Based Architecture\n\nA microservices-based architecture helps prevent single points of failure by distributing functionality. Design services to be idempotent and stateless, decoupling state to enhance resilience and scalability. Utilize self-healing orchestration tools like Kubernetes, and adopt active-active configurations for data and state management to ensure continuous availability and robust fault tolerance. - Koushik Sundar, Citibank\n\n9. Build A Decoupled System\n\nYou can achieve high availability and fault tolerance in many ways, but at what cost? Tools like Kubernetes and load balancers can help. But to effectively achieve high availability and fault tolerance, you should build a decoupled system so that different components are isolated and have only the necessary dependencies between them. This will allow you to orchestrate the workload only for those components that require it. - Oleg Lola, MobiDev\n\n10. Focus On Optimization\n\nOne strategy for ensuring high availability and fault tolerance through effective workload orchestration is to focus on optimization. Not every node needs the same amount of processing power; it’s important to have load balance functionality and do stress testing to stay ahead of the game. - Syed Ahmed, Act-On Software\n\n11. Follow The Principle That ‘Everything Fails, All The Time’\n\nThis may be a bit more philosophical, but when designing any critical system, I follow this principle: “Everything fails, all the time.” This mindset drives designs that eliminate single points of failure, favor distributed systems with “shared nothing” architecture, and incorporate queuing mechanisms. Though it’s often overlooked, non-software resilience—like multiregion deployments and robust network configurations—is also important, even in the cloud. - Elliott Cordo, Data Futures\n\n12. Use Containerization And Automated Scaling\n\nOne effective way to keep things running smoothly is to use containerization and automated scaling. This allows you to isolate applications, which makes them consistent across environments. Orchestrators help by automatically managing these containers and distributing workloads evenly while monitoring for failures. When an issue is detected, the orchestrator can adjust with little to no downtime. - Thomas Griffin, OptinMonster\n\n13. Implement Messaging Queues And Asynchronous Processing Patterns\n\nBased on our experience building healthcare apps, implementing message queues and asynchronous processing patterns is essential. By decoupling services and using tools like RabbitMQ, we create buffer zones that prevent system overload. If one component slows down, messages stay in the queue until processing capacity recovers. - Marc Fischer, Dogtown Media LLC\n\n14. Utilize Active-Passive Failover Architectures\n\nUtilize active-passive failover architectures by designing your system with an active instance and a passive standby. The passive instance takes over in the event of a failure, ensuring minimal downtime. - Manasi Sharma, Microsoft\n\n15. Ensure Multiple Redundancies\n\nUse redundant hardware, software and network components. Implement load balancing to evenly distribute workloads and clustering to allow multiple servers to operate as a single system, improving performance. Utilize database replication to ensure data accessibility across locations, even during failures. Together, these strategies ensure high availability and fault tolerance, creating a resilient infrastructure. - Brian Sathianathan, Iterate.ai\n\n16. Use Service Mesh Architecture With Open-Source Tools\n\nOne overlooked strategy I would like to highlight is using service mesh architecture with open-source tools like Istio or Linkerd. By abstracting network traffic management between services, you gain fine-grained control over load balancing, retries and automatic failovers. This approach will ensure high availability and fault tolerance without adding complexity to the application code. - Santhosh Vijayabaskar\n\n17. Implement ‘Degraded Mode’ Capabilities\n\nImplement “degraded mode” capabilities across all critical services. Instead of binary up-down states, design systems to gracefully reduce functionality when under stress. For example, disable real-time updates while keeping core transactions running, or serve cached data instead of live queries. This ensures business continuity even during partial failures. - Chandra Kuchi, Robinhood\n\n18. Take A Proactive Approach",

      "# [Mt. Joy (restaurant) by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2024-03-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Joy_(restaurant))\nRestaurant chain based in Seattle, Washington, U.S.\n\nMt. Joy is a restaurant chain specializing in chicken sandwiches, based in Seattle, Washington. The business launched a food truck on Capitol Hill in September 2023, followed by a brick-and-mortar restaurant on December 1. Ethan Stowell is among the co-owners of Mt. Joy, which specializes in fried chicken sandwiches.\n\nDescription\n\n[edit]\n\nMt. Joy has been described as a fast-casual restaurant chain specializing in chicken sandwiches that \"focuses on pasture-raised chickens sourced from local farms who have an environmentally-friendly focus\", according to The Seattle Times.[1] The magazine Seattle Metropolitan has said the sandwiches \"double as a means to overhaul agricultural processes that contribute to climate change\".[2] Mt. Joy bills itself as the \"first ever regenerative-focused\" restaurant in the Pacific Northwest.[3]\n\nThe business operates a brick-and-mortar restaurant on Seattle's Capitol Hill, as well as a food truck. The restaurant's interior has shades of green and white.[4] Spicy or mild versions of fried chicken sandwiches have breasts or thighs, as well as lettuce, tomato, and a house sauce on a brioche bun.[2] Mt. Joy also serves a portobello sandwich.[5] The menu also includes chicken tenders,[6] milkshakes, as well as French fries with five dipping sauces made in-house.[2] Mt. Joy sources ingredients locally and also serves beer. The custom buns are made by Franz Bakery.[2]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nConception and development\n\n[edit]\n\nRobbie Cape conceived of the business after watching Kiss the Ground, a 2020 documentary film about regenerative agriculture; he recruited regenerative farmer Grant Jones to co-found the restaurant, and also brought on chef and restaurateur Ethan Stowell to be a partner.[1][2][7]\n\nIn October 2022, The Seattle Times reported that owners hoped to open the first restaurant in Seattle by the Fall 2023, with additional locations planned throughout the Pacific Northwest. Mt. Joy's three-day pop-up and fried chicken sandwich test run was held at the Capitol Hill location of Stowell's Italian restaurant Tavolàta in October 2022.[1][2] The chickens were supplied by Hungry Hollow, Jones's family farm in Shelton, Washington.[8] During the pop-up, Mt. Joy also served the portobello sandwich, fries, and three varieties of milkshakes (chocolate, huckleberry, and vanilla).[8] Mt. Joy had another three-day pop-up at Stowell's restaurant Rione XIII in May 2023.[9][10][11]\n\nFirst food truck and brick-and-mortar restaurant\n\n[edit]\n\nIn September 2023, Mt. Joy launched a food truck on East Olive Way, in the parking lot of a former Starbucks shop. According to GeekWire, Mt. Joy had fifteen employees at the time.[5][12] Mt. Joy also announced plans to open a brick-and-mortar restaurant on Capitol Hill,[13] on the ground level of the Sunset Electric apartment building near the intersection of 11th and Pine Street.[3][14]\n\nThe restaurant opened on December 1, 2023, with a reported $1.5 million in funding from multiple investors.[15][16] Harry Cheadle of Eater Seattle noted how Mt. Joy opened in close proximity to multiple fried chicken eateries,[17] and even launched the same week as a Dave's Hot Chicken restaurant.[18] In addition to Hungry Hollow, four other farms in Western Washington have supplied chickens to Mt. Joy, as of late 2023.[18]\n\nAccording to Eater Seattle, the owners hope to expand to thousands of locations.[8]\n\nLeadership\n\n[edit]\n\nCape is the chief executive officer. Pat Snavely is another founding partner as well as chief marketing officer.[8] Justin Kaufman is a co-founder as well as Mt. Joy's chief technology officer.[7]\n\nDionne Himmelfarb, who has been a chef for Stowell, is the chief culinary officer,[2] and Jones is the chief agricultural officer.[7]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nGeorge Burquest of Seattle University's student publication The Spectator gave the white meat chicken sandwich a rating of 7 out of 10 and wrote, \"All in all, Mt. Joy was a very pleasant experience, but nothing to write home about. The sandwich looked like a dictionary definition ... and the flavors were by book as well.\"[4]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nFood portal\n\nChicken sandwich wars\n\nFried chicken restaurant\n\nList of chicken restaurants\n\nList of food trucks\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",

It sold its care delivery division to Transcarent in 2023 after having raised $270 million and pivoted solely to selling virtual care technology to health systems. The newly rebranded 98point6 Technologies has conducted several rounds of layoffs between then and now, with employees back in April noting the company had been whittled down to a skeleton crew.

Transcarent’s CEO, noted entrepreneur and investor Glen Tullman, will head up the combined organization, according to a spokesperson.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nFounded in 2020, Transcarent says it aims to provide a one-stop shop for workers navigating their benefits, looking for providers and accessing healthcare services. The company is a unicorn, most recently raising a $126 million Series D funding round in May last year that brought its total valuation to $2.2 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Accolade was founded nearly two decades ago and went public in 2020. The company offers a suite of navigation offerings, largely to employers, to assist employees with managing and understanding their benefits.\n\nThe combination of the two benefits technology companies, funded through financing from venture capital firm General Catalyst and Tullman’s 62 Ventures, will take Accolade private and create a single firm with more than 1,400 employer and payer clients, according to a press release.\n\nThe boards of both companies have already approved the acquisition, which is expected to close in the second quarter.\n\nThe deal would bring together both navigators’ services, including Transcarent’s WayFinding offering — a generative AI product launched last year where users could ask questions about which healthcare services are covered and how much they might cost, the companies said.\n\n“The two companies share a focus on embracing AI and advanced technology to change the way consumers experience the healthcare system,” Rajeev Singh, Accolade’s CEO, said in a statement.\n\nThe acquisition comes after Accolade reported a nearly $100 million net loss during its 2024 fiscal year ended last February, compared with a nearly $460 million loss in 2023. The company reported revenue of $414 million in fiscal 2024, an 18% increase from the prior year.\n\nThe benefits navigator is expected to release earnings for its third quarter of fiscal 2025 on Thursday. Accolade expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to be a loss between $3 million and $5 million and revenue between $104 million and $107 million."

    "# Comprehensive Report on 98point6 and Transcarent\n\n## Company Overview: 98point6\n\n98point6 is a healthcare technology company that specializes in AI-powered virtual care solutions. Founded in 2015, the company initially focused on providing direct-to-consumer telehealth services, allowing patients to connect with board-certified physicians via a mobile app. The platform aimed to make healthcare more accessible by offering 24/7 care through text-based consultations. However, in 2023, 98point6 sold its care delivery division to Transcarent for approximately $100 million, pivoting its business model to focus on licensing its technology to healthcare organizations [(Hannah E. Zaitlin, Foley, 2023)](https://www.foley.com/people/zaitlin-hannah-e/).\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### Acquisition by Transcarent\n\nIn March 2023, Transcarent acquired 98point6's care delivery platform, which included its AI-driven virtual care technology and an affiliated medical group. This acquisition was part of Transcarent's strategy to enhance its offerings in the healthcare navigation space, combining 98point6's technology with its own services to provide a more comprehensive healthcare experience for self-insured employers [(Hannah E. Zaitlin, Foley, 2023)](https://www.foley.com/people/zaitlin-hannah-e/).\n\n### Shift in Business Model\n\nFollowing the acquisition, 98point6 transitioned to a technology licensing model, focusing on selling its virtual care technology to health systems rather than providing direct patient care. This shift has been accompanied by significant layoffs, reducing its workforce to a \"skeleton crew\" as it adapts to its new business focus [(25 – HIStalk Practice, 2025)](https://histalkpractice.com/2025/02/03/news-2-3-25/).\n\n### Current Status\n\nAs of early 2025, 98point6 has reportedly ceased its telehealth service, with some clients, such as Allegheny College, seeking alternative providers after being informed that the service was going out of business. This has raised questions about the viability of 98point6's new direction and its ability to sustain operations in the competitive healthcare technology market [(25 – HIStalk Practice, 2025)](https://histalkpractice.com/2025/02/03/news-2-3-25/).\n\n## Company Overview: Transcarent\n\nTranscarent is a healthcare platform designed for self-insured employers, aiming to simplify the healthcare experience for employees. Founded in 2020, the company focuses on integrating various healthcare services, including virtual care, benefits navigation, and health information, into a single platform. Transcarent's mission is to provide high-quality, affordable healthcare while improving the overall experience for both employers and employees [(Glen Tullman, Transcarent, 2024)](https://transcarent.com/press-releases/transcarent-introduces-wayfinding-an-ai-powered-consumer-health-experience).\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### Acquisition of Accolade\n\nIn January 2025, Transcarent announced its acquisition of Accolade, a benefits navigation company, for approximately $621 million. This deal is expected to enhance Transcarent's capabilities by combining its AI-driven navigation services with Accolade's offerings, which include virtual primary care and patient advocacy. The acquisition will take Accolade private and is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2025 [(Emily Olsen, HR Dive, 2025)](https://www.hrdive.com/news/transcarent-acquire-accolade-621-million-health-benefits-navigation/736869/).\n\n### New Product Launch: WayFinding\n\nTranscarent recently launched WayFinding, a generative AI product designed to help users navigate their healthcare benefits and connect with appropriate care providers. This service aims to address the complexities of healthcare navigation, providing personalized support and guidance to users. Glen Tullman, CEO of Transcarent, emphasized the importance of integrating AI into healthcare to improve user experiences and outcomes [(Glen Tullman, Transcarent, 2024)](https://transcarent.com/press-releases/transcarent-introduces-wayfinding-an-ai-powered-consumer-health-experience).\n\n### Financial Performance\n\nTranscarent has positioned itself as a unicorn, having raised significant funding, including a $126 million Series D round in May 2023, which brought its valuation to $2.2 billion. The company aims to leverage its recent acquisitions and technological advancements to expand its client base and improve healthcare delivery for its members [(Emily Olsen, HR Dive, 2025)](https://www.hrdive.com/news/transcarent-acquire-accolade-621-million-health-benefits-navigation/736869/).\n\n## Executive Leadership\n\n### Glen Tullman, CEO of Transcarent\n\nGlen Tullman, a seasoned entrepreneur and investor, leads Transcarent. He has a strong background in healthcare technology and has been instrumental in shaping the company's vision of integrating virtual care and benefits navigation. Tullman has expressed a commitment to leveraging AI to transform the healthcare experience, stating, \"We’re here, committed as ever, with a steadfast focus on our mission of providing access to high-quality, affordable health and care\" [(Glen Tullman, Transcarent, 2024)](https://transcarent.com/press-releases/transcarent-introduces-wayfinding-an-ai-powered-consumer-health-experience).\n\n## Market Position and Future Outlook\n\n### Competitive Landscape\n\n98point6 and Transcarent operate in a highly competitive healthcare technology market, facing challenges from established players and new entrants. The shift in 98point6's business model raises concerns about its long-term viability, while Transcarent's aggressive expansion strategy through acquisitions positions it as a significant player in the healthcare navigation space.\n\n### Future Prospects\n\nThe success of Transcarent's recent acquisitions and product launches will be critical in determining its market position. The integration of 98point6's technology and Accolade's services could enhance Transcarent's offerings, but the company must navigate the complexities of merging different corporate cultures and operational models. As the healthcare landscape continues to evolve, Transcarent's focus on AI and user experience will be essential for maintaining a competitive edge.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, 98point6 has undergone significant changes following its acquisition by Transcarent, transitioning from a direct-to-consumer telehealth provider to a technology licensing model. Meanwhile, Transcarent is actively expanding its services and capabilities through strategic acquisitions, positioning itself as a leader in healthcare navigation. Both companies face challenges in a competitive market, but their focus on innovation and user experience will be crucial for future success."
