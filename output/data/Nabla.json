This sounds strange but I think it is somewhat comforting having Nabla there. Knowing if I need to stop typing and just listen to the person in front of me that decision isn’t going to cost me minutes and hours at the end of the day, taking time away from my family. I think this is a real trade off and decision primary care doctors make regularly. If I spend more time with a patient, try to help them and go above and beyond - that time is probably going to be taken away from sleep and family time.

      "# [Nabla Core API documentation](https://docs.nabla.com/guides/intro/)\nThe Nabla Core API allows you to transcribe medical encounters, generate structured clinical notes, extract normalized data, and more!\n\nUse our speech-to-text engine, fine-tuned on medical terms (medications, diseases, symptoms, etc.), to transcribe a medical encounter.\n\nFor real-time transcription: Use the Web Socket Transcribe API.\n\nFor small audio files: Use the REST API.\n\nGiven a transcript of an encounter — either from our transcription API our from another source — you can generate a summarizing clinical note.\n\nFor an encounter of about 10 minutes, generating a clinical note from its transcript takes around 20 to 40 seconds. For longer transcripts, the generation will take few more seconds. You can either make a synchronous HTTP call, or rely on our asynchronous webhook callback which avoids blocking calls and is more resilient to network interruptions.\n\nSummarize, with a patient-friendly language, the instructions given by the healthcare provider during an encounter.\n\nExtract conditions (including the related ICD-10 codes) and family history from a given clinical note, in a FHIR-compatible format.\n\nSend live audio of a provider's dictation to our speech-to-text engine, and receive accurately transcribed text in real-time.\n\nAdd expressions that are frequently mistranscribed to improve transcription quality.",
      "# [Nabla on Mobile](https://help.nabla.com/en/articles/2353922)\nNabla is available on both mobile and desktop devices. This article focuses on how to access Nabla on mobile: using the web app in a browser (recommended for Android devices) or the dedicated app for iOS devices.\n\nPlease note: If your organization is integrated with Nabla, your sign-in steps may differ.

Incoming calls may disrupt Nabla’s microphone access, affecting the ability to transcribe.\n\nTo avoid interruptions, we recommend the following best practices:\n\nEnable Do Not Disturb mode while using Nabla to eliminate disruptions.\n\nDo not lock your phone while using Nabla; keep the Web page or app open during your encounter.\n\nOn iOS, disable Low Power Mode, as it may lock your screen automatically.\n\nOn Android, disable Doze Mode (or equivalent manufacturer-specific power-saving features).\n\nIf You Receive an Incoming Call\n\nIf you receive an incoming call during your Nabla encounter, it will disrupt the microphone access on both iOS and Android. An orange screen will appear, indicating that access to the microphone has been lost. To restore access, follow these steps:"

My practice has been looking into these new AI medical scribes to help with our clinical documentation. Everyone’s pretty burned out from spending so much time on patient notes, so this seems like a really interesting solution. Are these tools safe & legit?\n\nI wanted to try DeepScribe and DAX but it seems like you have to go through sales. A friend recommended NoteMD and I’ve been trying it out for a few days. So far it’s pretty good (it doesn’t save patient recordings which is great), but sometimes it doesn’t capture a sentence or two.\n\nWhat do people think about using these? Are they safe?\n\nEDIT: Thanks all for your comments, please stop spamming me in DMs :-) Our practice ended up with NoteMD which is working great.\n\n## Comment ID ks7b78p with +35 score by [(DrTestificate_MD, Reddit, 2024-02-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7b78p/) (in reply to ID 1b0befu):\nYes some people are using them. Permanente ran a pilot study making it available to 10000 docs and a significant percentage of them used it for over 100 encounters over a 4 week period.

Captures most of what is said and knows where to put it (History, exam, A/P, PI etc). Produces paragraphs of prose. For some reason it sucks at documenting my reasoning in an A/P — wordy, misses the if-then logic. Helps a little with allowing more eye contact with patient during visit but I gave up on it. Takes me 2 min to write my own primary care notes (after a little pre-charting.) When an AI model can read my previous notes and learn how I document and reproduce my style then I’ll use it.

I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers. Full HIPAA compliance and patient information is protected.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more!

Providers are required to get verbal permission from patients before using the software during appointments, so you will know if your provider is using Nabla or not.

First, this ideal provider- patient ratio will have to be signed into law. What this ratio is I have no idea, so research should be done for every specialty. Second, where are they going to find these extra people to hire? There is shortage of Healthcare providers (and nurses) everywhere, and we simply could not produce enough providers.  Our pay is currently tied to RVU generation. How are you going to convince Healthcare systems in the US to hire more with the expectation that they work less and still have the same pay? To your point regarding squeezing us for work, everyone asked this question during implementation and the executives said no to extra work.  Lastly, as pointed out by many here,  written, typed, and dictated notes are full of errors themselves. These AI tools are just...tools. However way a note is written doesn't matter - in the end it's the provider who is responsible for the final output. AI, unfortunately, is here to stay and is very much part of our future. It is still also in its infancy. Future models will be more accurate and smarter than current ones.

The problem's that you're told to see too many patients, and while the obvious solution is hiring more staff, if they won't, the next solution is unionization, not perturbing your patients' healthcare through bad & privacy-infringing AI notetaking. Basically, you have a labor problem, but you want to relieve it by making healthcare and privacy problems for patients.\n\n#### Comment ID m7m13ji with +3 score by [(samu_rai, Reddit, 2025-01-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/1i2ecqq/uihc_now_using_ai_tool_known_to_hallucinate/m7m13ji/) (in reply to ID m7lzk44):\nThat article is echoing the concerns of the wired article - hallucinations. How many times do we have to underscore the importance of reviewing and checking your final note just like you would with any note written by any other method? When I use Nabla, I spend more face time with the patient because I don't have to type on a screen or write on paper. Immediately after each visit I generate a note from Nabla, review the note, and then select only the parts that I want. And the problem is not \"seeing too many patients\" -> it's literally the notes. Each encounter is expected to last between 30 and 60 minutes, which is standard all over the US since notes were still handwritten. Pre-AI, many doctors would continue typing these notes at home, spending hours every night. Hiring more people is great but you will have to overhaul the entire Healthcare system of the US to make this work, starting from increasing med school enrollments, increasing residency and fellowship positions, and then a big law to overhaul the payment scheme of CMMS to make sure that each and everyone is given ample time to type/hand-write all those notes.\n\n#### Comment ID m7m1kmi with +3 score by [(samu_rai, Reddit, 2025-01-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/1i2ecqq/uihc_now_using_ai_tool_known_to_hallucinate/m7m1kmi/) (in reply to ID m7lzk44):\nAnd no one, I mean nobody, recommends complete AI autopilot on notes.

I was later ordered incorrect labs by my doctor based on the notes it generated, assumingly because the AI scribe misheard “Hemoglobin A1C” as “Hepatitis C” through the microphone. Obviously if my doctor had been paying more attention she would have caught this before ordering the labs, but as others have mentioned, most docs (especially at UIHC) seem to have very little time or capacity to thoroughly listen to patient needs during the 4 minutes you have them face to face. This would not have happened if a human scribe had been present. Thankfully this was just a lab test (one I will likely still have to pay for), but it’s only a matter of time before the use of AI scribes results in improper IV drug orders and a patient ends up dead.\n\n## Comment ID m7e1klu with +21 score by [(nixnuckingfuts, Reddit, 2025-01-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/1i2ecqq/uihc_now_using_ai_tool_known_to_hallucinate/m7e1klu/) (in reply to ID 1i2ecqq):\nAs someone who reads physician notes dictated on Dragon I can confidently say they do not check for errors before signing the notes.

It gives you a gender neutral HPI (i.e. uses \"they/them\" pronouns) as well as mental status exam (I'm in psychiatry) and plan.  The MSE and plan are useless, at least for me. The HPI is decent.\n\nFreed doesn't show you a transcription live but you can access it afterwards. It gives a better HPI than Nabla and you can choose gender so it sounds better than using \"they/them\" all over. It also does a more honest job at the MSE; basically never attempts to write one and says \"not enough objective data.\" It also gives a plan and after visit summary. Both are really solid. Anything you say during the appointment in terms of plan, it'll capture. If I mention diet and exercise, it'll put in specifically what I said rather than just say \"lifestyle changes\". I have a template for plan that I prefer using so I don't actually use that part but I could easily see someone finding it useful (unlike Nabla where I don't think most people would find the generated plan sufficient). The after visit summary is gold though. Writes instructions as a letter from you to the patient, with an easy to read list of what was talked about during the appointment. \n\nIf they cut the price in half, I'd recommend Freed without any doubt.

I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers. Full HIPAA compliance and patient information is protected.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more! You can also shoot me an email ernest.chan@getathelas.com and I'd be happy to chat more.\n\n## Comment ID k23jy34 with +1 score by [(toastycitrus, Reddit, 2023-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k23jy34/) (in reply to ID 16qm7ji):\nEdit\n\n### Comment ID ki1hlaw with +1 score by [(Emotional_Walrus_782, Reddit, 2024-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/ki1hlaw/) (in reply to ID k23jy34):\nCan actually do this with Heidi.

I’ve been using Suki. It has direct access to my EMR and schedule so it’s as simple as clicking the patients name and starting the “note”. I access it through my phone and leave the phone near the patient and myself. It then processes the ramblings (I can be all over the place sometimes) of the visit and manages to organize it into HPI and a/p VERY accurately and in better detail than what I would normally do without it. It also does physical exam and other things like patient instructions but you’d need to speak out the physical exam which is weird. It has been life changing because it takes away the mental burden of documenting after seeing patients. I often do all my notes at lunch and then after the afternoon session because it allows me to stay on time and focus on the patient. Knowing all the details are being captured and all I need to do is organize the note a little is FANTASTIC. It requires so much less brain power than formulating the note and truly does it so well.\n\nCurrently offered by my practice but it’s 400 a month which is pricey.

These are the ones on my radar:\n\n- I have heard good things about Freed, but haven’t tried them. Their website doesn’t do a good job of showing off the potential, so I’m not sure why so many have tried it.\n- I have tried Nabla, and it seems great for the HPI section of a psychiatric intake, if you don’t mind it excluding some details. The problem is the option to add custom instructions isn’t very robust and prevents you from, say, adding a template and having the AI fill it out. It’s free to try out and easy to sign up.\n- I have heard people talk highly about Lindy AI, and it apparently can be used to automate more of your workflow than just note writing. Their CEO apparently has gotten in trouble for some shady things, but I’m very interested in trying them out.\n- Ambience Healthcare’s website had some sample transcriptions from their AI a few months ago, and I was very impressed. It’s on my radar to try soon\n- I wouldn’t recommend DeepScribe, as they historically marketed having your note ready only after several hours, which I believe is because they send the audio transcripts to employees for quality assurance, but maybe this has changed.\n- I wouldn’t recommend DeepCura. I didn’t like their UI and people have said they make it very difficult to cancel your subscription.\n- I wouldn’t recommend Amazon’s AWS Healthscribe since it’s very expensive compared to the competition.\n- Similarly, I suspect Nuance’s scribe is very expensive, as well.\n\nThere are other’s, like Suki ai, AutoScribe, iScribe, and more, but I have never heard anyone talk about these. I’m hoping r/Psychiatry can reach a consensus as to the clear favorite, but we’re not there yet. If I had to recommend some to try, I would go with the first four I mentioned.\n\n### Comment ID kt1kk1q with +5 score by [(Xvi_G, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1kk1q/) (in reply to ID kt1k11a):\nThank you\n\nI'm pretty sure it was your (this) specific response that I most wanted to revisit form the old post\n\n### Comment ID kt37dto with +2 score by [(pickyvegan, Reddit, 2024-03-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt37dto/) (in reply to ID kt1k11a):\nDeepScribe has changed- your note is ready almost immediately now.\n\n### Comment ID l0krb3x with +2 score by [(Proper_Parking_2461, Reddit, 2024-04-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/l0krb3x/) (in reply to ID kt1k11a):\nI’ve been using Twofold and its been really doing the job.

It costs me about 25 cents to do a progress note and 75 cents to do an evaluation.  I predict the costs to come down even more in the future.  Not having to type anymore during appointments - priceless.  I have arthritis in my hands so I could not stand the constant banging on the keyboard all day. It is also better because I can pay more attention to my patients and less to my keyboard.  I think my bill to Microsoft cognitive services (GPT-4 calls) is like $40-50/mo.\n\nIt also does after visit summaries for the patient. I also told it the APA criteria for CPT coding, so it helps me with that as well.\n\nMicrosoft does a BAA with everyone and says their implementation of GPT-4 is HIPAA compliant.  That being said, I don't put patients' last names into GPT-4, to keep the data somewhat deidentified.  I tried to get a BAA with OpenAI, who ignored all my messages, and I went down the rathole trying to encrypt all the PHI in the transcript, then decrypt the output.  Although it was a mistake, I did create a wonderful and effective LLM tool for automatically deidentifying and reidentifying healthcare information, though.\n\nIt works great, listens to all my patients appointments and churns out notes in the background while I work.  At the end of the day, there are my notes.  The quality of the notes is excellent. All must be proofread because the AI does occasionally make a mistake.\n\nI haven't had much luck getting it to diagnose patients or create treatment plans, not that I would trust it for such a thing, but I had some initial hopes for creating an \"AI colleague\", which were dashed.  It will scribe whatever I said to the patient during the appointment, but it doesn't seem to have any thinking or reasoning ability of its own. It is wonderful at organizing and summarizing information, though.\n\nI'm fulltime clinical, so it took me about 3 months of tinkering in my spare time to get something workable. I am a bit rusty, and had to get up to speed on all the new technology as well as teach myself Python.\n\nMy malpractice carrier advised me to get and document verbal approval from patients. After hearing about it, all except 1 said yes. She took some introductory LLM class and didn't seem to understand the technology very well, just enough to be scared of it.\n\nI have some colleagues who are working on a product called Berries ([berries.icu](https://berries.icu)). We have basically created the same sort of software independently, but they are productizing it and have it open beta right now.  The cost is reasonable and I saw a demo that seemed promising.\n\n### Comment ID m05kb5s with +2 score by [(Technical_Catch3880, Reddit, 2024-12-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/m05kb5s/) (in reply to ID kt2y1rx):\nThank you for this.

Berries is the best thing I've seen yet in the commercial space for psychiatrists.\n\nI have CAP/MPT. The rep I spoke to seemed well aware of AI technology and had an answer ready for me.  At the end of the day, the note is still my note, and I'm responsible for its contents the same as ever, regardless of what computer tools I used to help put it together for me.\n\nI use Microsoft Azure because they gave me a BAA and they also claim their GPT-4 implementation is HIPAA compliant. ChatGPT is not HIPAA compliant regardless of whether or not they use data for training - don't ever put your patient data into Chat GPT.  I also don't put patient last names, addresses, birthdays, phone numbers, or other nonessential PHI etc into GPT-4, in order to maintain patient privacy even more. There are no laws or even regulations about this technology, but I am satisfied with the patient privacy precautions I've taken.\n\nMy state is a 2 party consent state for recording of electronic communications, so I need to document consent for that. Not that I would record my patient interviews without their consent. I don't know that you specifically need consent to share PHI with a partner for whom you have a BAA, but I do also explain the LLM technology to my patients and get their consent for it.\n\nIt was impractical to scribe a psych eval until OpenAI came out with the gpt4-32k model. Most evals are 10000+ tokens and won't fit into the 8k window gpt4 had. You could sometimes use gpt-3.5 with the 16k window, but even that was too small sometimes, and the results were not as good. These days, we have gpt4-turbo, which has a 128k token window and can handle anything I throw at it, for much less $/token to boot.\n\n## Comment ID kt196a7 with +26 score by [(Xvi_G, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt196a7/) (in reply to ID 1b4uvub):\nFor my own experience, I've only just dipped a toe in the water. So far have used both MDHub and Nabla\n\nMDHub has an app that uses your phone mic, and keeps recording of your screen is off or of you switch out of the app. That's a small thing but it has a big impact on convenience of the recording. Particularly if you are working with a low talker.\n\nNabla seemed to have the slight edge in regards to the final formatting of the intake note, but I should note that I only used them utilizing their own standard formatting. I did not utilize any template other than just noting it as a new session and recording\n\nEither way, I found that for me (at this point) my best option was pasting THAT note to Chatgpt, uploading a word doc that has my tight intake format, and dictating some of my own observations that wouldn't have been transcribed from an intake note (MSE, general assessment and differential, some intangibles, etc)\n\nI also can tell chatgpt the tone I am seeking (clinical, narrative-driven, symptom focused, etc) and get a pretty good final product\n\nIt's a developing workflow that still needs  a lot of tweaking but it makes for a pretty solid final note. And while this would be too much effort for a med check, it's been a huge time saver and burnout protection for my 90 minute CAP intake evals\n\n### Comment ID kt1lrpb with +11 score by [(zpacksnackpack, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1lrpb/) (in reply to ID kt196a7):\nSounds like a great workflow! \n\nOne thing I’d note is Chat GPT is not HIPAA complaint (unless you have the super expensive enterprise version). \n\nBastion GPT is a great HIPAA compliant version you may want to check out it.\n\n#### Comment ID kt1q0ht with +7 score by [(Xvi_G, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1q0ht/) (in reply to ID kt1lrpb):\nThat's good to know about the alternate option\n\nFwiw I don't have any identifying info in my notes\n\nThat's all attached later via epic dot phrases\n\nBut certainly good to keep in mind\n\n## Comment ID kt1gj47 with +8 score by [(touchfuzzygetlit, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1gj47/) (in reply to ID 1b4uvub):\nI used FreedAI but it’s expensive like $100/month\n\n### Comment ID kt1o3nm with +2 score by [(DekkuRen, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1o3nm/) (in reply to ID kt1gj47):\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n#### Comment ID kt1qqzr with +9 score by [(colored_water, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1qqzr/) (in reply to ID kt1o3nm):\nI use freed and I love it.

For context, we are an integrated clinic with a focus on primary care and mental health.\n\nOur main criteria for evaluation were quality, security and easiness to use and roll out, but we looked at other factors as part of the trial (customization of notes, learning curve, speed and more).\n\nWe identified about 7 different solutions and shortlisted 3 based on various factors - mostly based on their public documentation or support centers but also discussion in this community. We then ran an actual trial for all three of the shortlisted options. The seven we looked at initially are: Suki, DAX, Deepscribe, Nabla, Twofold Health, Freed AI, Heidi Health.\n\nThe three solutions we trialed were Twofold Health, Freed and Heidi. All good solutions, each has its pros and cons:\n\nTwofold Health : \n\n* Easy to use and setup: intuitive UI made the rollout easy\n* Accuracy was very good. They offer the ability to create customized note templates for specific needs. They also provide system template you can reuse easily.\n* Quick note processing times - average of about 20 seconds.\n* Customer support VERY responsive.\n* Good price point \n\n* One time it added something we didn’t talk about in the assessment section (it was clinically relevant and we should have talked about it, but still..)\n* Do not offer an option to email the patient letter directly to the client.\n* Probably a younger company\n\n\n\nHeidi\n\n* Ability to create custom note templates . Was a bit challenging at first but eventually I was able to create a good template.\n* “Ask Heidi” feature where you can essentially  send it a prompt and get answer (this was not part of our evaluation criteria but it was pretty cool). Helps with coding\n* A lot of good resources on security and privacy\n\n* Interface a bit “all over the place” -not as simple and intuitive as the other options\n* A bit hard to use on mobile and tablet\n* I was able to get it to hallucinate a in the assessment and plan sections a couple of times. It added information that was not discussed.\n\n\n\nFreed AI\n\n* Simple and rather intuitive UI \n* Easy to use mobile app (not a must for us, but was nice nonetheless)\n* System claims to learn your style over time. I saw minor improvements during the trial, but perhaps it needs more learning time.\n\n* Higher price point (more than double of others)\n* Offer only SOAP format. No ability to create your own templates.\n* Sometimes notes take time to process. Especially at peak times . There was one time it took over 5 minutes to generate.\n\nWe ended up going with Twofold. It ticked off most of the boxes, and we were super happy with their support team. But all three solutions were quite impressive.\n\nPersonally I’m super excited about AI scribes and I feel like we are just scratching the surface of capabilities. In any case, I hope this helps!\n\n### Comment ID m24wg0j with +3 score by [(Snoo-9266, Reddit, 2024-12-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/physicianassistant/comments/1heexy4/can_someone_recommend_an_ai_scribe_i_can_use_on/m24wg0j/) (in reply to ID m24uqgk):\nDid you test how long it takes to generate the notes?

I have also been looking for an AI scribe for a clinic and have tested freed, deepscribe and DAX.. \n\nFreed's drawback for us was that you had to record the session, then end it to move to the next one.. that didn't really work well with our patient flow.\n\nDeepscribe we are still evaluating. Their templates are not really editable, but I do have to say they are the only one that I know of that isn't using a ChatGPT wrapper. Their support and change integration is great. they really are constantly working on making things better. All employees seem to really like working there on all the calls that I've been on.\n\nDAX.. it's basically a scribe that feeds into Dragon Dictate medical one..  I got a demo, and really it's just dragon dictate.. price point is high as well, and Nuance just got bought out by microsoft.. so they really aren't sure how progress will happen, or the improvements they were planning if it will still be on schedule..\n\n### Comment ID m33j4f7 with +1 score by [(guru_med, Reddit, 2024-12-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/physicianassistant/comments/1heexy4/can_someone_recommend_an_ai_scribe_i_can_use_on/m33j4f7/) (in reply to ID m24uqgk):\nHelpful review, thanks!\n\n## Comment ID m23ce4a with +10 score by [(BillyPilgrim777, Reddit, 2024-12-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/physicianassistant/comments/1heexy4/can_someone_recommend_an_ai_scribe_i_can_use_on/m23ce4a/) (in reply to ID 1heexy4):\nI have used the free trial with Freed AI.

I've trialed a few find they're all fairly similar to be honest as most are just chatGPT wrappers. My takeaways:\n1) Accuracy is pretty good. Every once in a while there are hallucinations or inaccuracies, but the vast majority of the time it's good\n2) It's nice to look and engage with the pt the majority of the visit  instead of being buried in a laptop\n3) There are some features I love - for instance, after the note is written I can type \"write me a work note related to this absence, or write me a patient education handout about x condition, write me a consult note to x specialist regarding this visit. Again, needs some tweaking after sometimes, but saves some time\n4) Probably the best part about it is having the visit documented even if I don't finish it. I have a terrible memory, and, before the scribe, if I didn't finish the note that day I'd find I'd be going back a few days later and even forgetting some details. This way, it's all there, so even if I go back in a week I know exactly what was said, what we planned, etc. \n5) Note formatting can we wonky. Standard notes tend to be really narrative or aren't laid out how I usually do my primary care notes (numbered issues). So sometimes I have to edit a bit or tell the program to \"re-write the note in jot form and be more concise\". I also haven't dabbled with templates much, but I think this is how you can be more set up for success in how you typically chart if you make good templates.\n\n## Comment ID m24hdue with +2 score by [(HonestScholar822, Reddit, 2024-12-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/physicianassistant/comments/1heexy4/can_someone_recommend_an_ai_scribe_i_can_use_on/m24hdue/) (in reply to ID 1heexy4):\nI use the paid version of Heidi because I like my notes in a specific format (the pro version enables custom templates so the notes are formatted how you want).

You can also choose the level of detail.  Most people set Heidi at \"Goldilocks\", which is a level of detail just right for most people, but you can also select \"detailed\" and \"super-detailed\".  With \"detailed\" there are some direct quotes and with \"super-detailed\", there are many direct quotes.  They do include a free trial of full access, which I think is for 1 week, so you can try it out before using it.\n\n## Comment ID m2a8bdl with +2 score by [(mavipowpow, Reddit, 2024-12-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/physicianassistant/comments/1heexy4/can_someone_recommend_an_ai_scribe_i_can_use_on/m2a8bdl/) (in reply to ID 1heexy4):\nI’ve been using the free Heidi ai version for about a week.

It has been surprisingly good at taking a rambling patient's complaints and putting together a fairly accurate HPI.  It can also spit out a decent crack at the assessment and plan, however, I am someone who usually adds a bit more detail to the assessment and plan, particularly if there are nuances that I am trying to explain in the note.  DAX tends to output very simple A&Ps like \"Chest pain: check labs\", which is obviously over simplified for a possibly serious complaint, which requires me to go back and edit the suggested note or delete it and write my own.  Also, we have a trash EHR and integration is minimal. I literally have to copy and paste the DAX output into my EHR.   It is also fairly annoying to have to explain to patients that I am using an AI scribe. As you might expect, some patients are very skeptical of this or have privacy concerns.  Right now my organization requires that with each encounter for which we use AI, I am required to disclose to the patient what is happening. However, I imagine that in the future organizations will start to use standardized forms part of the check-in process.  \n\n\n\n\nWith a slight increase in detail/accuracy and better EHR integration, I really could see it making a big improvement in my workflow and efficiency.  At this point, I continue to use it because I feel it is time neutral and as the technology improves, the time savings will improve. \n\n\n\n\nEDIT:  you also asked about the medicolegal risk of the conversations being recorded.  I believe the raw audio is deleted within a short time frame, roughly one month, but would assume that anything you say could hypothetically come up during legal discovery. However, I feel this is the case at baseline, as some patients do record their visits without our knowledge, so I am already assuming that anything I say during a patient encounter could hypothetically be brought up during a lawsuit.\n\n### Comment ID kwu55tb with +2 score by [(Azure340, Reddit, 2024-03-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1bp12do/how_did_nuance_dax_or_other_ai_scribes_affected/kwu55tb/) (in reply to ID kwsuyxr):\nI had the same issue using a different AI medical scribe.\nI ended up creating a software in which i dictate but without the commas and periods etc and it structures it into a soap note using my language.

I have been using DAX with OCHIN Epic in the outpatient setting the last two weeks and it has saved me a significant amount of time. I pre-chart with it. Then during the visit it captures, summarizes and incorporates pertinent HPI information into my previously pre-charted problems. I summarize at the end of my visit our a/p with problem, recommendations and follow up. DAX captures that correctly. My challenge is that it is not integrated yet into the Epic problem list, linking with the appropriate diagnostic codes. I was told last week that is coming in November. In 2025 they are supposed to implement bulleted rather paragraph information option as well, which I prefer. There is definitely some note bloat.

I was skeptical and bailed on the original DAX rollout, but I have been using DAX Copilot integrated with Epic, which has saved me quite a bit of time. I frequently edit extensively and substitute medical terms for the language derived only from the provider-patient conversation. I could cut down on that by dictating the assessment and plan again more concisely in medical terms instead of just relying on that which was expressed in lay terms to the patient. I find it easier at the end of the clinic to edit the output over typing (and not actively listening as well) or recreating info from my scrawled notes. It's good to know about the coming upgrades. I do wish it could be personalized more to reflect my own style, but I may be asking too much.\n\n## Comment ID kwsideh with +4 score by [(TheBeardMD, Reddit, 2024-03-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1bp12do/how_did_nuance_dax_or_other_ai_scribes_affected/kwsideh/) (in reply to ID 1bp12do):\nthis is the DAX demo i found: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBulTCOVWg8&pp=ygUSREFYIG1lZGljYWwgc2NyaWJl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBulTCOVWg8&pp=ygUSREFYIG1lZGljYWwgc2NyaWJl)\n\n### Comment ID kwtvlyo with +11 score by [(TheMightyAndy, Reddit, 2024-03-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1bp12do/how_did_nuance_dax_or_other_ai_scribes_affected/kwtvlyo/) (in reply to ID kwsideh):\nI know she's a clinician cause she's wearing her stethoscope\n\n## Comment ID kx2xj43 with +1 score by [(BLVCK_FLVG_, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1bp12do/how_did_nuance_dax_or_other_ai_scribes_affected/kx2xj43/) (in reply to ID 1bp12do):\nI know there’s a few out there, haven’t tried most of them.

      "# Post ID 1ia07ql: AI Scribe Recommendations for Internal Medicine with +21 score by [(doctorgreybc, Reddit, 2025-01-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/InternalMedicine/comments/1ia07ql/ai_scribe_recommendations_for_internal_medicine/)\nHey everyone,\n\nHope you’re all surviving the grind of clinic and hospital life. I’ve been exploring AI scribes lately, and with so many options out there, it’s both exciting and a bit overwhelming. As internists, we deal with complex patient histories, detailed assessments, and comprehensive plans, so finding the right tool to streamline documentation is crucial. I’ve been testing a few solutions and wanted to share my thoughts—and hopefully get your input too.\n\nFor context, I’m looking for something that can handle the depth and breadth of internal medicine documentation—think detailed H&Ps, progress notes, and discharge summaries. My main criteria are accuracy, ease of use, and affordability. Here’s where I’m at with the tools I’ve tested:\n\n# Wavo Health\n\n* Pros\n   * Strikes a great balance between functionality and ease of use.\n   * Works seamlessly across devices, which is a huge plus for rounding and clinic days.\n   * Clean, intuitive UI that feels designed for private practice or smaller groups.\n   * Reasonable pricing and responsive support team.\n   * Consistently solid note quality, even for complex cases.\n   * Customizable templates reduce editing time by tailoring notes to your preferences.\n   * Multi-document creation (H&Ps, progress notes, discharge summaries) with easy EMR copy/paste.ovides a summary of each encounter, making follow-up appointments more efficient.\n   * Wavo AI lets you ask questions about encounters or patients, like \"ask Heidi\" but more expandable.\n   * Assigns notes to patients, creating a sleek dashboard with vitals (e.g., BP, glucose, BMI) and summaries—super unique and helpful for follow-ups IMO.\n* Cons:\n   * None major so far, but I’d love to hear from anyone who’s used it long-term in an internal medicine setting.\n   * The note processing takes maybe max to up to a minute, but I guess sometimes depending on the note length it could be faster or longer. But I guess that's standard among all the other applications.\n\nRight now, Wavo Health is my top choice. It ticks most of my boxes, and I’ve been really impressed with its performance, especially for detailed notes.\n\n# Freed AI\n\n* Pros:\n   * Simple and intuitive UI.\n   * Mobile app is a nice bonus for quick documentation on the go.\n   * Claims to learn your style over time—I saw minor improvements during my trial.\n* Cons:\n   * Higher price point (more than double some others).\n   * Notes can take a while to process during peak times—once took over 5 minutes, which isn’t ideal during busy clinic hours.\n   * Only offers SOAP format, which feels limiting for more nuanced internal medicine documentation.\n\nFreed AI is a close second, but the higher cost and slower processing times are holding me back.\n\n# Heidi Health\n\n* Pros:\n   * Ability to create custom note templates (a bit challenging at first but useful once set up).\n   * “Ask Heidi” feature is cool for coding help, which can be handy for billing and documentation.\n   * Strong focus on security and privacy.\n* Cons:\n   * Interface feels cluttered and not as intuitive as others.\n   * Not very mobile-friendly, which is a drawback for rounding.\n   * Had a couple of instances where it hallucinated info in the assessment and plan sections, which is a red flag for complex IM cases.\n\nHeidi Health has some great features, but the occasional hallucinations and clunky interface make me hesitant.\n\n# Twofold Health\n\n* Pros:\n   * Easy to use and set up—intuitive UI made the rollout smooth.\n   * Very accurate notes with the ability to create customized templates, which is great for IM-specific documentation.\n   * Quick note processing times (average of about 20 seconds).\n   * Responsive customer support and good price point.\n* Cons:\n   * Once added something clinically relevant but not discussed in the assessment section.\n   * Doesn’t offer an option to email patient letters directly, which could be a drawback for discharge summaries or patient communication.\n   * Seems like a younger company, so long-term reliability is a bit of a question mark.\n\nI’ve heard great things about Twofold Health, especially their accuracy and support. If anyone’s using it in an internal medicine setting, I’d love to hear your experience.\n\n# Nabla\n\n* Pros:\n   * Focuses on simplicity and ease of use.\n   * Good for quick notes and straightforward documentation.\n* Cons:\n   * Lacks some of the advanced features and customization options needed for complex IM cases.\n   * Not as robust for detailed assessments or specialty-specific documentation.\n\nNabla seems like a solid option for simpler workflows, but it might not be enough for the depth of internal medicine documentation.\n\n# Tali\n\n* Pros:\n   * Canadian-based, which might be a plus for some.\n* Cons:\n   * Uses a Chrome extension, which isn’t my favorite setup. I prefer a dedicated app for ease of use and data storage, especially for detailed IM notes.\n\n# Mutuo Health\n\n* Pros:\n   * Also Canadian-based...\n* Cons:\n   * UI felt clunky and unintuitive.\n   * Pretty basic compared to the others—not worth pursuing further for IM needs.\n\n# Abridge, DeepScribe, and Suki\n\nThese feel more enterprise-level, with a heavy focus on EMR integration. They’re powerful but might be overkill for private practice or smaller internal medicine groups.\n\n# - My Shortlist -\n\nRight now, I’m leaning toward Wavo Health—it ticks most of my boxes in terms of quality, functionality, and price. Freed AI is a close second, but the higher cost and slower processing times are holding me back. Heidi Health has some cool features, but the occasional hallucinations and clunky interface make me hesitant.\n\nHas anyone been using Wavo Health, Freed AI, Twofold Health, or Nabla long-term in an internal medicine setting? How’s your experience been? Any hidden gems I’m missing? Or any red flags I should watch out for?\n\nAlso, if you’ve tried other solutions like Suki, DAX, or DeepScribe, I’d love to hear your thoughts. I’m especially curious about Twofold Health—I’ve heard good things about their accuracy and customer support.\n\nThanks in advance for your insights! I’ll keep testing the free versions and report back, but your feedback would be incredibly helpful.\n\nP.S. If you’ve tried any of these or have other recommendations, feel free to drop a comment or DM me. Always happy to chat more about this stuff!\n\n## Comment ID m98ih97 with +6 score by [(Snoo-9266, Reddit, 2025-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/InternalMedicine/comments/1ia07ql/ai_scribe_recommendations_for_internal_medicine/m98ih97/) (in reply to ID 1ia07ql):\nI’m missing a major thing in Wavo that I know other apps like Twofold and Heidi have. \nCreating your own template takes your notes from good to amazing. \nSince I adjusted my template on Twofold to specify exactly the things I want, I have a lot less editing to do. \nFor example, I request vitals to be formatted in a specific way and then I just read them out. \n\nFor anyone who wants to get a system that you can personalize over time, the ability to edit templates is a must in my opinion.\n\n### Comment ID m9kpgzg with +1 score by [(doctorgreybc, Reddit, 2025-01-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/InternalMedicine/comments/1ia07ql/ai_scribe_recommendations_for_internal_medicine/m9kpgzg/) (in reply to ID m98ih97):\nHey! Thanks for mentioning that. Wavo does have that in the same way that Twofold and Heidi have. So you can definitely create your own template which is actually what I do. Or Wavo can learn from how you edit your notes later on. It creates or proposes a template so you can decide if you want to use that later. It also has multiple templates so you can choose from. I don't think it has the functionality that Heidi has with community templates that you can pick up from another provider.  \n  \nFor your specific use case of requesting vitals to be formatted in a specific way, I actually do something similar. The way I did it is that I have my own template, and with Wavo you can create like a document and essentially I select that document to use my template. It also has this thing which is... I don't know if it's helpful for you but if a vital is mentioned during the encounter, the application creates a patient view where you can see all the vitals and all the different encounters that you had with the patient. It's really helpful for me for follow-ups.\n\n## Comment ID m98806j with +4 score by [(Proper_Parking_2461, Reddit, 2025-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/InternalMedicine/comments/1ia07ql/ai_scribe_recommendations_for_internal_medicine/m98806j/) (in reply to ID 1ia07ql):\nWe've been using Twofold Health and its been great.

I keep seeing a few companies advertising AI scribe software and claims they can have their AI create a medical note from an encounter on the fly. Obviously, companies will always make their stuff sound better than it is so was just curious if anyone has used this and what they thought. I would love to have >90% of my chart done before I leave the room and just edit them at the end of the day as opposed to writing full notes. Even with templates, all of the clicking and editing still adds up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheers\n\n## Comment ID jo42les with +29 score by [(Cynicalteets, Reddit, 2023-06-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/149akp5/anyone_have_any_experience_with_ai_scribe_software/jo42les/) (in reply to ID 149akp5):\nMy supervising physician uses one, and his notes are so hard to understand.\n\nReason for visit: chest pain\n\nPatient states he has chest. It occurs daily and is located on the left side of the chest. There is no radiation. It has been getting worse. Patient states pain is intermittent, sometimes worse, sometimes better. No known exacerbating factors. He also has been having back pain. Pain has been constant without worsening. Pain is not associated with dizziness or diaphoresis. He has never been woken up by the pain. The pain is worse with exertion. \n\nHe contradicts himself a million times in his notes, or he’ll say the same thing in 10 different ways. His notes are so difficult to follow.\n\n### Comment ID jo447v0 with +22 score by [(vagician_at_cervix, Reddit, 2023-06-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/149akp5/anyone_have_any_experience_with_ai_scribe_software/jo447v0/) (in reply to ID jo42les):\nThat’s honestly not bad.

At least the HPI written by an AI says something. I regularly see some extraordinarily shitty HPIs. I kid you not, the other day I was consulted on a patient and the HPI says, “Pt is a 70 yo with h/o HTN who presents due to AMS. Pt called 911 due to feeling unsafe at home.” No other information.\n\nIf any docs read this, do not consult someone if you write bullshit notes, don’t bother to call the consultant, and provide absolutely no explanation in the consult order. I have shit to do and I’m not digging through the chart to try to figure out what you want from me. I’m going to write a one-liner note that says, “Unclear reason for consult. No recommendations at this time. Reconsult if necessary and include consult question.” What I’m actually saying is, “You’re a lazy ass and bad at your job.”\n\nMy frustration with shit notes and shit consults is boiling over.\n\n## Comment ID jo6r77q with +4 score by [(spmurthy, Reddit, 2023-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/149akp5/anyone_have_any_experience_with_ai_scribe_software/jo6r77q/) (in reply to ID 149akp5):\nI am using it as dictation software . HIPAA etc makes it all a little too complicated and I do not want to be the one training our patients to be comfortable with it. What I do is go back to my room and dictate a rough soap note without having to be precise about what goes in which section and the AI scribe tool organizes it.

Deepscribe and getfreed come up. I haven't used either.\n\nI have scheduled the demo for deep scribe on friday. From looking into it, it seems like they use AI to make a rough draft and then they send it to scribes here (I'm in the US) to do the proofreading for you as much as possible, and make sure things are organized in the right places on the soap note. They also seem to be the ones picking icd-10s, but with little training in that department so you have to go back and make sure the codes are correct.\n\nI'm also really interested in hearing people's experience with using ambient AI scribe software. I think it has a lot of potential, but I don't know if it's there yet.\n\n### Comment ID k5llh2g with +1 score by [(Interesting_Bag4859, Reddit, 2023-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/149akp5/anyone_have_any_experience_with_ai_scribe_software/k5llh2g/) (in reply to ID jukli13):\nHi.

We used it for a year (psychiatry) and it didn’t work out for us. It essentially just transcribes the conversation and separates it arbitrarily into different paragraphs. \n\nThe biggest issue came when we tried to cancel 14 months later because we no longer were using it. We were told that our next opportunity to cancel the contract was 10 months from now. You can only cancel it at the year mark exactly, even though we had had it for over a year. \n\nIn their long terms and conditions (which we unfortunately did not read to begin with) it strips you of every right you have to dispute or cancel.

Generally impressed. If they plan to continue exposing it to new data, it should get better with time. \n\nI think it’s important to keep in mind that the more structured your conversation is, the more structured the note will be. If you go back and forth between diagnoses it would make it more difficult for even a human scribe. \n\nIn settings of more multipurpose AI like GPT4 there is a position evolving called a prompt engineer. Someone who studies the impact of how queries are structured. We cannot control what the patient says, but we can gently direct them to give  us the info we need. Sometimes."

      "# [Generative AI in the EHR: Powering NextGen® Ambient Assist & restoring clinician well](https://www.nabla.com/blog/gen-ai-ehr/)\nBack\n\nGenerative AI in the EHR: Powering NextGen® Ambient Assist & restoring clinician well-being\n\nJune 5, 2024·7 minute read\n\nBack in November Nabla announced an exciting integration with NextGen Healthcare, a leading provider of innovative, cloud-based healthcare solutions to power NextGen® Ambient Assist. NextGen Ambient Assist is a fully automated ambient listening solution that delivers clinical notes directly to NextGen Healthcare's electronic health record (EHR) platforms, significantly reducing clinical documentation time.\n\nNextGen Healthcare was one of the pioneers in embracing Generative AI, recognizing its potential to mitigate physician burnout and enhance the overall patient experience.\n\nGenerative AI in the EHR\n\nWhile widespread adoption of EHRs has undeniably improved care coordination, enhanced data accessibility, and streamlined diagnosis, it is also contributing to documentation fatigue and clinician burnout. According to a 2021 study from JAMIA, for every eight hours that office-based physicians have scheduled with patients, they spend more than five hours in the EHR. When it comes to clinical documentation, a study found that writing and reviewing notes takes up 78% of all physician interactions with EHRs. Challenges include data entry, interoperability, cluttered visual display, and diverting attention from patient care among others.\n\nThe emergence of Generative AI presents a myriad of opportunities to streamline various stages of the clinical workflow, spanning from clinical documentation and coding to clinical decision support and patient communication.\n\nNextGen Ambient Assist, powered by Nabla\n\nNabla has been integrated with NextGen Ambient Assist since October 2023, and is already available to nearly 5,000 users of the NextGen Mobile application. NextGen Ambient Assist uses the audio from patient encounters to automatically capture subjective, objective, assessment, and plan (SOAP) notes that help organize providers' observations. These notes are automatically presented in NextGen Mobile for provider review and editing before inclusion in the patient's EHR chart. NextGen Ambient Assist has been shown to save providers an average of 1.5 to 2 hours of documentation per day.\n\nIn an effort to address the national shortage of mental and behavioral health professionals, the company also recently announced it was making NextGen Ambient Assist available to psychiatrists and other practitioners in the behavioral health space.\n\nAs Nabla and NextGen Healthcare continue to work together to expand ambient AI capabilities in the EHR, we interviewed Jeremy Dixon, Vice President of Product Development at NextGen Healthcare to gain insights into the company’s perspective on our partnership.\n\nLet’s chat!\n\nKenza: What challenges and industry trends led NextGen Healthcare to seek out an integration with Nabla?\n\nJeremy: NextGen is committed to materially enhancing the care provider experience and are continuously evaluating opportunities to improve EHR usability and effectiveness. Several of our clients requested to prioritize addressing the documentation burden that weighs heavily on their providers, compelling them to devote extra hours at the clinic or stay up late completing documentation from the previous day. Besides being time consuming, existing live scribing and virtual scribing alternatives are also expensive and adversely impact providers’ ability to be more present with the patient during the encounter. We recognized the potential of AI to comprehensively address these challenges and sought out partners who were developing solutions in this space.\n\nKenza: Why was this a priority?\n\nJeremy: Timely access to care providers continues to be a significant challenge in the industry, even as physician shortages and clinician burnout are impacting the supply side of the equation. We prioritized this concern since it has the potential to not only significantly alleviate the documentation burden for providers directly, but to also unlock incremental clinical capacity which is advantageous to both patients and the financial sustainability of the practices we serve.\n\nKenza: What was NextGen Healthcare looking for in an ambient AI solution for clinical documentation?\n\nJeremy: We were looking for a partner that was collaborative in nature, with a track record of proven technology capable of addressing the problem in real-time through a fully tech-based solution. Further, we wanted to work with a partner who appreciates the many ethical and security concerns associated with AI usage in the care journey and had the appropriate controls and measures in place to ensure a safe and defensible care experience for our clients and patient communities.\n\nKenza: How did you find out about Nabla, and why did you choose to partner with us?\n\nJeremy: We found Nabla during our discovery work when vetting various ambient vendors. Nabla’s vision aligned with our mission to reduce provider documentation time and cognitive load while also meeting stringent standards for security and governance. Nabla’s technology stack is modern and extensible, and the engineering and product teams proved to be agile and highly responsive to our client’s evolving needs.\n\nKenza: What made our solution stand out over others that you researched?\n\nJeremy: The strength of the technical stack (API first), the alignment of mission and vision to make a positive impact with healthcare providers, and the overall leadership of the executive team at Nabla. Additionally, the speed at which the product continuously improves reflects a refreshing emphasis on clients’ needs and results-oriented growth model.\n\nKenza: What have you been most impressed with?\n\nJeremy: There are many areas that impressed us, but the one that stands out is Nabla’s commitment to understanding the problem space and willingness to engage our end customers to cultivate a deep understanding of their needs and requirements. The technology is capable of standing on its own merits but what differentiates this offering is its customer-centricity.\n\nKenza: What surprised you the most from working with the Nabla team? What’s it like working with us?\n\nJeremy: What stands out most is the exceptional collaboration we've experienced while working with Nabla. The strong focus on user feedback is evident in both the way the team swiftly resolves our clients’ queries, as well as their ability to integrate new innovations into the product rapidly and meet the evolving needs of clients.\n\nKenza: What kind of feedback have you heard from your clients using NextGen Ambient Assist?\n\nJeremy: Overall, our clients love it. They call it a “game-changing” solution. They say that it allows them to focus on the patient and saves them a lot of time on the backend. Since it is fully integrated within our EHR platform, many of our users have reported they no longer have to take “work” home and are enjoying a better work/life balance. One of our provider clients shared that a typical encounter plus documentation time can take under 10 minutes, so he was able to add five new patients a day. He also noted that it saves their practice money since it costs a lot less than having a virtual or live scribe.\n\nKenza: How has NextGen Ambient Assist benefited your company and business as a whole?\n\nJeremy: It has allowed us to take a significant step forward in how we support our clients as trusted partners. By re-imagining the provider experience and solving a real-world problem for our providers that positively impacts their experience while also enhancing care quality, access and practice sustainability we continue to live our vision of delivering better healthcare outcomes for all.\n\nKenza: How do you envision our partnership moving forward?\n\nJeremy: While the early returns from our partnership have been tremendous, we are focused on scaling the impact we believe we can deliver across our complete customer base. Further, we are taking the lessons from the real-world deployment of this AI solution into the EHR (i.e., reimagining clinical workflows, physician change management and training, adoption patterns etc.) to shape the next evolution of AI capabilities that will positively impact the provider and patient experience.\n\n–\n\nNabla offers multiple integration options, including a deep white label integration through API that allows EHRs to stay on brand.",
      "# [Nabla](https://www.nabla.bio/news/denovo)\nToday, we’re thrilled to share a major advance in our ability to design antibodies fully computationally. We developed a new AI protein design system, JAM, capable of designing high quality lead antibodies de novo given just a target protein sequence and/or structure. We thoroughly experimentally validated this new approach on a range of therapeutic applications and carefully studied the therapeutic properties of these de novo antibody designs.\n\nWhere we are today\n\nRecent advances in deep learning have revolutionized our ability to predict the structures of proteins and design proteins de novo. While these tools hold enormous promise for medicine, there has been relatively little progress in using them to develop viable drugs. Antibodies, as the most established drug format, are a great first real-world test for de novo drug design. However, so far no AI systems have shown they are able to produce high quality lead antibodies from scratch in a way that is robust and generalizes across protein targets and antibody formats.\n\nOur advance\n\nWe introduce a new AI system called Joint Atomic Modeling (JAM) and use it to design de novo antibodies with good affinity, epitope-specificity, and function. We show that our antibodies have strong developability and other drug-like properties with no optimization, making it possible to replace traditional discovery with de novo design for the first time.\n\nWe show generalizability across a diverse range of soluble targets with orders of magnitude higher hit rates compared to traditional discovery, including a protein target with no known structure in the PDB. Next, we apply JAM to a set of multipass membrane proteins, which as a class are considered difficult to drug, and show for the first time we can design antibodies against them from scratch, including the first computational designed binders, of any kind, against Claudin-4 (CLDN4) and the GPCR (CXCR7). When JAM is given time to “think” and introspect on its results, we see significantly improved success rates and affinities - echoing recent trends for large language models (LLMS) and teasing the exciting possibility of “test-time scaling laws” for protein design.\n\nOur technical report is the first demonstration of de novo antibody design relevant to therapeutic discovery and the first evidence of computationally designed antibodies that can target hard-to-drug membrane proteins including GPCRs.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nWhat implications does this have for the development of new drugs?\n\nUnlocking new target space\n\nMultipass membrane proteins, like GPCRs, are notoriously challenging. Our approach enables the design of antibodies that can not only drug these targets directly but also serve as precise tools for target validation and the exploration of new biology.\n\nIntractable targets—such as tight junction proteins, disordered proteins, and transiently stable complexes—cannot be produced reliably in recombinant form, making traditional antibody development difficult. By designing antibodies entirely in silico and with high hit-rates, we bypass the need for recombinant proteins and could even directly test for antibody function from the onset of the discovery process.\n\nFaster antibody development\n\nOur results show significant efficiency gains in experimental time result from the small library sizes enabled by JAM’s high hit-rates. Importantly, this accelerates the antibody development process whilst also cutting costs.\n\nExcitingly, epitope-specificity enabled by JAM addresses a key attrition point in traditional discovery campaigns, where antibodies often fail to target the desired epitope. This boost in specificity increases the likelihood of discovering functional leads and cuts down on wasted effort.\n\nPrecisely controllable antibody behavior\n\nSpecies cross-species reactivity requirements can be used to guide epitope selection, streamlining the preclinical development process.\n\nEngineered selectivity can similarly be selected for at the epitope level, generating antibodies that either (i) target multiple related proteins with desired binding profiles, or (ii) minimizing binding to closely-related family members and/or dangerous off-targets.\n\nResults\n\nJAM designed antibodies have good affinity, specificity, developability and function within therapeutic range and exhibit strong early stage developability without any experimental optimization.\n\nGood affinity - We designed de novo antibodies against 7 disclosed (SARS-CoV-2 RDB, HER2, IL-13, PD-1, TrkA, CLDN4, CXCR7) and 1 undisclosed protein target and saw that top designs achieved double-digit to single-digit nanomolar affinities that put them within therapeutic-range for a high quality lead antibody.\n\nSpecificity - Importantly, designs made from one target rarely bound another target, suggesting good specificity. Excitingly, three VHH designs we made to Claudin-4 were over 100x more selective for Claudin-4 than three other closely related off target Claudins (3, 6, & 9). Strong selectivity like the result we saw here is critical to ensuring therapeutic antibodies are safe and can be administered at high doses to achieve the maximum therapeutic impact.\n\nEarly stage developability - We evaluated early stage developability properties of our de novo antibodies and found expression levels, monomericity, and polyreactivity at or better than leading monoclonals (mAbs). These are promising indications that these designs will behave well in manufacturing and formulation, two important hurdles to clear for a commercially viable drug.\n\nFunction - We tested the functional activity of our de novo antibodies using target-specific functional assays. For SARS-CoV-2, we measured neutralization activity using a pseudovirus assay and saw IC50 values in the sub-nanomolar range (0.65 nM). We also use epitope mapping to confirm our designed antibodies bound to the desired functional sites, providing robust evidence of disease-relevant function.\n\nWe use JAM to develop the first computationally designed antibodies against multipass membrane proteins, achieving strong affinity, specificity and desired function. This has long been considered a ‘holy grail’ of antibody engineering but has not been previously reported.\n\nMembrane Protein Targeting - We demonstrate JAM's ability to target challenging multipass membrane proteins by designing antibodies against two therapeutic targets: claudin-4 (CLDN4) and the GPCR CXCR7. To enable efficient screening of large design libraries against these membrane-bound targets, we leveraged JAM's general protein design capabilities to create soluble protein proxies (solMPMPs) that preserve the native extracellular epitopes while enabling solution-phase characterization.\n\nFor both targets, this soluble proxy strategy proved successful. Selected antibodies showed high-affinity binding to their native targets expressed on engineered cell lines, with maintained specificity. Notably, CLDN4-targeting antibodies also demonstrated binding to OVCAR3 cells, an ovarian cancer line expressing endogenous CLDN4, validating their potential therapeutic relevance. These results represent the first demonstration that computational design can generate antibodies against this historically challenging but therapeutically crucial target class.\n\nJAM shows strong signs of generalization, including to novel targets not in the training set, and demonstrates early evidence of test-time scaling laws. We show how using JAM to design experimental libraries further improves performance and compresses design and affinity optimization into a single experimental step.\n\nStrong Generalization - JAM demonstrated broad generalization across multiple dimensions of antibody design. We validated its capabilities on diverse targets by generating both single-domain antibodies (VHHs) and full-length monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), achieving comparable affinity and function across formats. Notably, JAM successfully designed high-affinity, specific antibodies to a novel target absent from the PDB, indicating genuine generalization beyond training data.\n\nScaling test-time compute - A particularly exciting finding emerged when allowed JAM to introspect on its outputs and perform multiple rounds of iterative design at inference time. By increasing these computational iterations, we observed substantial improvements: 3-fold higher success rates, 10-fold better affinities, and unexpectedly, greater structural diversity - all while maintaining developability and humanness. This previously unobserved relationship between test-time compute and protein design success warrants investigation into the best way to allocate compute between training and inference to maximize experimental success.\n\nOne-Shot Affinity Optimization - We further enhanced JAM's capabilities by combining computational design with focused experimental sampling. Using error-prone PCR to explore sequence neighborhoods around JAM-designed binders, we achieved up to 100-fold improvements in affinity, reaching picomolar binding strengths. This hybrid approach effectively compressed de novo design and affinity optimization into a single experimental step, significantly streamlining the discovery process.\n\nLimitations\n\nThere are a few things we're working on to improve JAM and to better deliver on the promise of de novo antibody design:",

      "# [Researchers say an AI-powered transcription tool used in hospitals invents things no one ever said by Garance Burke, Hilke Schellmann, apnews.com, garance-burke on 2024-10-26](https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-health-business-90020cdf5fa16c79ca2e5b6c4c9bbb14)\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Tech behemoth OpenAI has touted its artificial intelligence-powered transcription tool Whisper as having near “human level robustness and accuracy.”\n\nBut Whisper has a major flaw: It is prone to making up chunks of text or even entire sentences, according to interviews with more than a dozen software engineers, developers and academic researchers. Those experts said some of the invented text — known in the industry as hallucinations — can include racial commentary, violent rhetoric and even imagined medical treatments.\n\nExperts said that such fabrications are problematic because Whisper is being used in a slew of industries worldwide to translate and transcribe interviews, generate text in popular consumer technologies and create subtitles for videos.\n\nMore concerning, they said, is a rush by medical centers to utilize Whisper-based tools to transcribe patients’ consultations with doctors, despite OpenAI’ s warnings that the tool should not be used in “high-risk domains.”\n\nThe full extent of the problem is difficult to discern, but researchers and engineers said they frequently have come across Whisper’s hallucinations in their work. A University of Michigan researcher conducting a study of public meetings, for example, said he found hallucinations in eight out of every 10 audio transcriptions he inspected, before he started trying to improve the model.\n\nA machine learning engineer said he initially discovered hallucinations in about half of the over 100 hours of Whisper transcriptions he analyzed. A third developer said he found hallucinations in nearly every one of the 26,000 transcripts he created with Whisper.\n\nThe problems persist even in well-recorded, short audio samples. A recent study by computer scientists uncovered 187 hallucinations in more than 13,000 clear audio snippets they examined.\n\nThat trend would lead to tens of thousands of faulty transcriptions over millions of recordings, researchers said.\n\n___\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center’s AI Accountability Network, which also partially supported the academic Whisper study. AP also receives financial assistance from the Omidyar Network to support coverage of artificial intelligence and its impact on society.\n\n___\n\nSuch mistakes could have “really grave consequences,” particularly in hospital settings, said Alondra Nelson, who led the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy for the Biden administration until last year.\n\n“Nobody wants a misdiagnosis,” said Nelson, a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. “There should be a higher bar.”\n\nWhisper also is used to create closed captioning for the Deaf and hard of hearing — a population at particular risk for faulty transcriptions. That’s because the Deaf and hard of hearing have no way of identifying fabrications “hidden amongst all this other text,” said Christian Vogler, who is deaf and directs Gallaudet University’s Technology Access Program.\n\nOpenAI urged to address problem\n\nThe prevalence of such hallucinations has led experts, advocates and former OpenAI employees to call for the federal government to consider AI regulations. At minimum, they said, OpenAI needs to address the flaw.\n\n“This seems solvable if the company is willing to prioritize it,” said William Saunders, a San Francisco-based research engineer who quit OpenAI in February over concerns with the company’s direction. “It’s problematic if you put this out there and people are overconfident about what it can do and integrate it into all these other systems.”\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the company continually studies how to reduce hallucinations and appreciated the researchers’ findings, adding that OpenAI incorporates feedback in model updates.\n\nWhile most developers assume that transcription tools misspell words or make other errors, engineers and researchers said they had never seen another AI-powered transcription tool hallucinate as much as Whisper.\n\nWhisper hallucinations\n\nThe tool is integrated into some versions of OpenAI’s flagship chatbot ChatGPT, and is a built-in offering in Oracle and Microsoft’s cloud computing platforms, which service thousands of companies worldwide. It is also used to transcribe and translate text into multiple languages.\n\nIn the last month alone, one recent version of Whisper was downloaded over 4.2 million times from open-source AI platform HuggingFace. Sanchit Gandhi, a machine-learning engineer there, said Whisper is the most popular open-source speech recognition model and is built into everything from call centers to voice assistants.\n\nProfessors Allison Koenecke of Cornell University and Mona Sloane of the University of Virginia examined thousands of short snippets they obtained from TalkBank, a research repository hosted at Carnegie Mellon University. They determined that nearly 40% of the hallucinations were harmful or concerning because the speaker could be misinterpreted or misrepresented.\n\nIn an example they uncovered, a speaker said, “He, the boy, was going to, I’m not sure exactly, take the umbrella.”\n\nBut the transcription software added: “He took a big piece of a cross, a teeny, small piece ... I’m sure he didn’t have a terror knife so he killed a number of people.”\n\nA speaker in another recording described “two other girls and one lady.” Whisper invented extra commentary on race, adding “two other girls and one lady, um, which were Black.”\n\nIn a third transcription, Whisper invented a non-existent medication called “hyperactivated antibiotics.”\n\nResearchers aren’t certain why Whisper and similar tools hallucinate, but software developers said the fabrications tend to occur amid pauses, background sounds or music playing.\n\nOpenAI recommended in its online disclosures against using Whisper in “decision-making contexts, where flaws in accuracy can lead to pronounced flaws in outcomes.”\n\nTranscribing doctor appointments\n\nThat warning hasn’t stopped hospitals or medical centers from using speech-to-text models, including Whisper, to transcribe what’s said during doctor’s visits to free up medical providers to spend less time on note-taking or report writing.\n\nOver 30,000 clinicians and 40 health systems, including the Mankato Clinic in Minnesota and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, have started using a Whisper-based tool built by Nabla, which has offices in France and the U.S.\n\nThat tool was fine-tuned on medical language to transcribe and summarize patients’ interactions, said Nabla’s chief technology officer Martin Raison.\n\nCompany officials said they are aware that Whisper can hallucinate and are addressing the problem.\n\nIt’s impossible to compare Nabla’s AI-generated transcript to the original recording because Nabla’s tool erases the original audio for “data safety reasons,” Raison said.\n\nNabla said the tool has been used to transcribe an estimated 7 million medical visits.\n\nSaunders, the former OpenAI engineer, said erasing the original audio could be worrisome if transcripts aren’t double checked or clinicians can’t access the recording to verify they are correct.\n\n“You can’t catch errors if you take away the ground truth,” he said.\n\nNabla said that no model is perfect, and that theirs currently requires medical providers to quickly edit and approve transcribed notes, but that could change.\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\nBecause patient meetings with their doctors are confidential, it is hard to know how AI-generated transcripts are affecting them.\n\nA California state lawmaker, Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, said she took one of her children to the doctor earlier this year, and refused to sign a form the health network provided that sought her permission to share the consultation audio with vendors that included Microsoft Azure, the cloud computing system run by OpenAI’s largest investor. Bauer-Kahan didn’t want such intimate medical conversations being shared with tech companies, she said.\n\n“The release was very specific that for-profit companies would have the right to have this,” said Bauer-Kahan, a Democrat who represents part of the San Francisco suburbs in the state Assembly. “I was like ‘absolutely not.’ ”\n\nJohn Muir Health spokesman Ben Drew said the health system complies with state and federal privacy laws.\n\n___\n\nSchellmann reported from New York.\n\n___\n\nAP is solely responsible for all content.

In the race to test generative AI in medicine, ambient scribes — which listen in to the audio of a visit and turn it into a structured clinical note for the electronic health record — are leading the pack. And to find the right scribe at the right price, health systems are pitting them against each other.\n\nThe latest update of STAT’s Generative AI tracker captures nearly 90 health systems experimenting with ambient scribes — many in small pilots, but some committing to full implementation. They span from online-only telehealth companies to federally qualified health centers, though the majority of early adopters remain large, research-focused academic medical centers, many of which are developing and marketing their own tools using generative AI.\n\nadvertisement\n\nA half-dozen companies dominate AI scribe contracts with these health systems, including Microsoft’s Nuance, Nabla, and Epic-partnered Abridge. But analysis from Gartner has found more than 50 companies providing automated medical documentation for providers.

      "# [Can AI save the medical profession? by Dr. Jamie Ioane, Carter Do, Sadiq Rahman, Edwin Leap, Amruti Borad, Erin Waldrop, Douglas Sirutis, Neil Anand, Ben Hourani, Muhamad Aly Rifai on 2024-06-03](https://kevinmd.com/2024/06/can-ai-save-the-medical-profession.html)\nI was working in a busy GP clinic when I finished seeing my last patient for the day, and I felt a sense of relief that the day was over; however, that relief was quickly overshadowed by the daunting mountain of paperwork I needed to complete before I could go home. In general practice, this work pattern is becoming expected practice throughout the profession. GPs routinely spend 1 to 3 hours outside work daily, catching up on patient notes, referrals, insurance claims, and lab results. This pattern is becoming more untenable for many, contributing to the increasing rates of burnout, mental health issues, and intention to quit being higher than they have ever been in modern medicine. Although other aspects of medicine have been progressing, there has been little headway made with regard to clinician efficiency and satisfaction in the workplace. Until now…\n\nOver the last six months, I have used a “generative-conversational artificial intelligence” (AI scribe for short) to help me with my job. The AI scribe writes all of my clinic notes just by listening to my consultation. It seems like magic compared to other digital tools we use in medicine, and I feel like I can do the job I was trained to do rather than an expensive record keeper. It takes the self-imposed and managerial time pressure away, significantly improving rapport with my patients. It feels like you are participating in a practical/OSCE exam, where you are doing your best because everything you say is transcribed and summarized. What patients find impressive are the improved engagement with clinicians and the ability to leave the consultation with a well-worded and written treatment plan. In some literature, they have been shown to foster improved engagement with patients by improving communication and understanding and reducing clinician multitasking, which is known to increase the rates of misdiagnoses and errors.\n\nSo how does it work? AI scribes are mostly browser-based and use the same processes: listening to the conversation, performing a voice-to-text translation, generating a transcript, and then sending the transcript for summarizing. AI scribes like Nabla copilot summarize the transcript using ChatGPT 3’s underlying parent AI, GPT3. Following a predetermined template, this summary creates a clinical note for the patient’s health record. Additional notes and dictations can be added as needed, and the note (output) can be copied and pasted into the patient record or even printed to give to the patient. Some can rewrite the note as a referral to a particular specialty and include ICD-10 coding.\n\nObtaining patient consent is of the utmost importance when utilizing the AI scribe. This ensures that patients are fully aware of how the transcription and summary process is conducted and how their data is used. In my experience, the reception to this has been overwhelmingly positive over the last six months, with only one patient declining the use of the AI scribe. Most, if not all, appreciated having my undivided attention during the consultation, which further underscores the importance of patient consent in this process.\n\nHowever, they are far from perfect. There are concerns about these AI scribes regarding information privacy, data standards, and safety. Although companies that own these AIs outline their safety regulatory practices (GDPR and HIPAA compliant), clinicians must be wary of any company that submits patient data to the underlying AI model for reinforcement/teaching the AI. AI needs billions of pieces of text data to learn. Suppose a patient is identified within the transcript. In that case, the potential for a breach of privacy is higher as someone (not in the clinical context) could retrieve information on that consultation by asking for the AI prompts, thereby breaching patient privacy.\n\nThere are also issues regarding the workflow that I have found to be archetypal to all AI scribes. If the voice transcription is having difficulty, the note will be sparse and lack meaningful salient points. Moreover, if there are connection or server issues, entire parts of the consultation will be missing.\n\nIf transcription misinterpretations occur, these misinterpretations are perpetuated throughout the document, which can be a pain to edit and can impact the diagnostic coding.\n\nI also found inconsistencies between the AI scribes, with the most serious related to patients with multiple problems (especially if they were mental health-related). I found that the detail required for documenting mental health assessments was less than optimal. In a small number of instances, the scribe didn’t generate any of the mental health information or action plan but retained only the physical issues.\n\nAI scribes are browser-based, so they store previous consultation transcripts and summaries locally and on the cloud. Therefore, we must be aware of patient privacy concerns and ensure that you delete all previously generated notes as they are saved on your account to reduce privacy breaches.\n\nDespite the concerns and challenges, it’s important to recognize the potential of AI scribes. They are tools that can free up cognitive space and reduce chronic multitasking, which is known to improve decision-making. This potential for improved efficiency and decision-making is a significant step forward in the evolution of health care practices, and I hope it only continues to get better. I suspect clinicians are already considering how they perform their roles and deal with the mounting responsibilities and pressures. This is the beginning of an equalizer between meeting the clinician’s needs and improving rapport and engagement within busy health services, which need a touch of humanity in today’s chaotic environment.",
      "# [Concerns about medical note-taking tool raised after researcher discovers it invents things no one said — Nabla is powered by OpenAI's Whisper by Jowi Morales, Bikki said:, Conor Stewart said:, drajitsh said: on 2024-10-27](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/concerns-about-medical-note-taking-tool-raised-after-researcher-discovers-it-invents-things-no-one-said-nabla-is-powered-by-openais-whisper)\nResearchers and engineers using OpenAI’s Whisper audio transcription tool have said that it often includes hallucinations in its output, commonly manifested as chunks of text that don't accurately reflect the original recording. According to the Associated Press, a University of Michigan researcher said that he found made-up text in 80% of the AI tool’s transcriptions that were inspected, which led to him trying to improve it.\n\nAI hallucination isn’t a new phenomenon, and researchers have been trying to fix this using different tools like semantic entropy. However, what’s troubling is that the Whisper AI audio transcription tool is widely used in medical settings, where mistakes could have deadly consequences.\n\nFor example, one speaker said, “He, the boy, was going to, I’m not sure exactly, take the umbrella,” but Whisper transcribed, “He too a big piece of a cross, a teeny, small piece … I’m sure he didn’t have a terror knife so he killed a number of people.” Another recording said, “two other girls and one lady,” and the AI tool transcribed this as “two other girls and one lady, um, which were Black.” Lastly, one medical-related example showed Whisper writing down “hyperactivated antibiotics” in its output, which do not exist.\n\nNabla, an AI assistant used by over 45,000 clinicians\n\nDespite the above news, Nabla, an ambient AI assistant that helps clinicians transcribe the patient-doctor interaction, and create notes or reports after the visit, still uses Whisper. The company claims that over 45,000 clinicians across 85+ health organizations use the tool, including Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and Mankato Clinic in Minnesota.\n\nEven though Nabla is based on OpenAI’s Whisper, the company’s Chief Technology Officer, Martin Raison, says that its tool is fine-tuned in medical language to transcribe and summarize interaction. However, OpenAI recommends against using Whisper for crucial transcriptions, even warning against using it in “decision-making contexts, where flaws in accuracy can lead to pronounced flaws in outcomes.”\n\nThe company behind Nabla says that it’s aware of Whisper’s tendency to hallucinate and that it’s already addressing the problem. However, Raison also said that it cannot compare the AI-generated transcript with the original audio recording, as its tool automatically deletes the original audio for data privacy and safety. Fortunately, there’s no recorded complaint yet against a medical provider due to hallucination by their AI notes-taking tools.\n\nEven if that’s the case, William Saunders, a former OpenAI engineer, said that removing the original recording could be problematic, as the healthcare provider wouldn’t be able to verify if the text is correct. “You can’t catch errors if you take away the ground truth,” he told the Associated Press.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter\n\nGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.\n\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nNevertheless, Nabla requires its users to edit and approve transcribed notes. So, if it could deliver the report while the patient is still in the room with the doctor, it would give the healthcare provider a chance to verify the veracity of its results based on their recent memory and even confirm information with the patient if the data delivered by the AI transcription is deemed inaccurate.\n\nThis shows that AI isn’t an infallible machine that gets everything right — instead, we can think of it as a person who can think quickly, but its output needs to be double-checked every time. AI is certainly a useful tool in many situations, but we can’t let it do the thinking for us, at least for now.\n\nContributing Writer\n\nJowi Morales is a tech enthusiast with years of experience working in the industry.

      "# [Products, Competitors, Financials, Employees, Headquarters Locations](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/nabla)\nWomen’s Health Pioneer Tia Rolls Out Nabla’s AI Assistant\n\nWomen’s Health Pioneer Tia Rolls Out Nabla’s AI Assistant March 20, 2025 Tia’s mission is to help women live healthier lives by driving the highest standard of care for women by integrating primary care with gynecology, mental health, and wellness services via a hybrid model Pilot results showed that Nabla reduced clinical note submission time by 50% for Tia providers, allowing them to focus more intently on their patients during virtual and in-person appointments Nabla, the leading ambient AI assistant for clinicians, today announced its newest partnership with Tia, the health clinic that has redefined the standard of care for women. After a successful two-month pilot program, Tia rolled out Nabla’s ambient AI assistant to its clinical team, marking a significant step forward in its technology-driven approach. This partnership enhances patient-centered care by alleviating clinical burnout and reducing the time spent on medical documentation for Tia appointments, regardless of whether it’s in-person or virtual. Tia’s recent Women’s Integrated Primary Care 2024 Outcomes Report cited that nearly half of women ages 18-35 reported negative interactions with healthcare providers, contributing to higher rates of mental health issues, lower life expectancy, and lack of midlife support. This issue is especially pronounced for women of color and LGBTQIA+ individuals, who are disproportionately affected by medical bias and limited access to healthcare services. That’s why Tia has pioneered a Primary Care ‘Plus’ model, that integrates primary care, reproductive health, mental health, and wellness services to provide comprehensive care for women. Relational care is a cornerstone of Tia’s innovative model, a patient-first approach that emphasizes active listening and shared decision-making between patients and providers. Excessive documentation requirements shift providers’ focus to screens rather than patients, adding administrative burden and potentially weakening the patient-provider relationship by creating a sense of disinterest. “Improving provider-patient interactions is at the heart of Tia’s mission,” Felicity Yost, Tia co-founder and CEO. “We want our providers to feel inspired by their work and deeply connected to their patients and not buried in administrative tasks. Nabla has given them back that time, allowing us to stay true to our values of gender equity and patient-centered care.” Thirty Tia providers participated in the two-month pilot across seven specialties, including, gynecology, acupuncture, psychiatry, preventative medicine, and primary care and family medicine. During the pilot, participants reported that the time required to submit a clinical note after an appointment was cut in half when using Nabla. After a successful pilot program, Tia expanded Nabla’s use across all its clinics and markets, integrating it into both telehealth and in-person appointments. Tia’s provider team quickly embraced the AI assistant, and it is now actively used by more than 90 providers, who have collectively generated over 50,000 clinical notes to date. Nabla has long recognized that gender inequity isn’t just present in clinical interactions–it’s also embedded in the very technologies meant to improve them. Many digital health innovations, including AI-powered technologies such as chatbots and ambient AI assistants, are intended to improve patient-clinician relationships and the overall patient experience. Unfortunately, many fall short of closing care gaps. With a lack of diversity in AI development and male-dominant, white perspectives shaping widely used AI models—including in health technology—biases embedded in these systems reflect and amplify existing inequalities, leading to racist and sexist interactions and outcomes. “Bias in healthcare technology is a serious issue,” said Delphine Groll, Co-Founder and COO of Nabla. “From the start, Nabla has ensured that the training datasets for our speech-to-text model include a great diversity of genders, accents, and languages to mitigate bias in clinical documentation. Moreover, our clinical documentation evaluation process includes checks to carefully assess whether facts are wrongly inferred, particularly due to gender biases.” PR Newswire PR Newswire empowers communicators to identify and engage with key influencers, craft and distribute meaningful stories, and measure the financial impact of their efforts.
