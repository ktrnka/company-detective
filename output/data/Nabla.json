While golfing in Idaho this weekend, another surgeon told me “I would rather deal with human waste, than spend extra time documenting my visits.” He has a scribe. Another very busy physician (also a leader in our group) told me today that she spends most nights typing notes. Yes Typing! All of this is to say that the normal medical provider is disconnected from the options out there because they are too busy and entrenched to see what is out there.\n\nRead more\n\nJun 7, 2023\n\nEric ArzubiPsychiatrist\n\nGreat work, you guys! I love the option of bullet vs. paragraph. I love the option of SOAP vs. non-SOAP notes.

Voice to text (Dragon), templates, pick lists, and even live scribes are now in the rear view mirror. Looking forward to returning to work tomorrow! I cakewalked through 34 patients yesterday and went home stress-free. If I had seen that many patients in the past, I would have been up until midnight finishing notes from home (not to mention the weight on my mind).\n\nRead more\n\nMay 21, 2023\n\nJim BoseovskiInternal Medecine\n\nWe started playing with the software this morning, it's absolutely incredible.\n\nRead more\n\nMay 8, 2023\n\nDr. Huma AliHospitalist\n\nI was overjoyed and clapped with pleasure many times today because of how helpful my Nabla was.

I’m telling everyone I know in psychiatry about Nabla.\n\nRead more\n\nJan 15, 2024\n\nDr. Erik BlutingerEmergency physician\n\nI appreciate the organization and format — it was accurate for my urgent care patient (and helped me recall information when seeing a high volume of patients in the clinic).\n\nRead more\n\nDec 28, 2023\n\nBrittany KunzaPrimary Care Physician\n\nI feel like Nabla is like my friend - coming along doing visits with me. This sounds strange but I think it is somewhat comforting having Nabla there. Knowing if I need to stop typing and just listen to the person in front of me that decision isn’t going to cost me minutes and hours at the end of the day, taking time away from my family. I think this is a real trade off and decision primary care doctors make regularly. If I spend more time with a patient, try to help them and go above and beyond - that time is probably going to be taken away from sleep and family time.

      "# [Security · Nabla](https://www.nabla.com/security/)\nSecurity\n\nUpdated September 5, 2023\n\nSecurity and compliance are top priorities for Nabla because they are fundamental to your experience with the product. Nabla is committed to securing your application’s data, eliminating systems vulnerability, and ensuring continuity of access.\n\nNabla uses a variety of industry-standard technologies, services and processes to secure your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and loss.\n\nOrganizational Security\n\nInformation security program\n\nWe have an Information Security Program in place that is communicated throughout the organization. Our Information Security Program follows the criteria set forth by the SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 frameworks, and has obtained the associated certifications.\n\nThird-Party Audits\n\nOur organization undergoes independent third-party assessments to test our security and compliance controls.\n\nThird-Party Penetration Testing\n\nWe perform an independent third-party penetration at least annually to ensure that the security posture of our services is uncompromised.\n\nIntrusion Detection\n\nUnusual network patterns or suspicious behavior are among Nabla’s most significant concerns for infrastructure hosting and management. Google Cloud Platform’s intrusion detection system (IDS) relies on signature-based security to identify traffic patterns that are similar to known attack methods.\n\nNabla does not provide direct access to security event forensics but does provide access to the engineering and customer support teams during and after any unscheduled downtime.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities\n\nRoles and responsibilities related to our Information Security Program and the protection of our customer’s data are well defined and documented. Our team members are required to review and accept all the security policies.\n\nSecurity Awareness Training\n\nOur team members are required to go through employee security awareness training covering industry standard practices and information security topics such as phishing and password management.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nAll team members are required to sign and adhere to an industry standard confidentiality agreement prior to their first day of work.\n\nMalware Protection\n\nAt Nabla, we believe that good security practices start with our own team, so we go out of our way to protect against internal threats and local vulnerabilities. All company-provided workstations are enrolled in Mobile Device Management (MDM) to enforce security settings including full-disk encryption, screen lock, and strong password policy.\n\nCloud Security\n\nCloud Infrastructure Security\n\nAll our services are hosted with Google Cloud Platform. They employ a robust security program with multiple certifications. For more information on our provider’s security processes, please visit GCP Security.\n\nData Hosting Security\n\nAll our data is hosted on Google Cloud Platform databases and storage buckets. These databases are located in the region you choose when you create your organization.\n\nEncryption at Rest\n\nAll data is encrypted at rest using AES-256. Google Cloud Platform stores and manages data cryptography keys in its redundant and globally distributed Key Management Service. So, if an intruder were ever able to access any of the physical storage devices, the Nabla data contained therein would still be impossible to decrypt without the keys, rendering the information a useless jumble of random characters.\n\nEncryption at rest also enables continuity measures like backup and infrastructure management without compromising data security and privacy.\n\nEncryption in Transit\n\nNabla exclusively sends data over HTTPS transport layer security (TLS) encrypted connections for additional security as data transits to and from the application and APIs.\n\nVulnerability Scanning\n\nWe perform vulnerability scanning and actively monitor for threats.\n\nLogging and Monitoring\n\nWe actively monitor and log various cloud services.\n\nHigh Availability\n\nEvery part of the Nabla service uses properly-provisioned, redundant servers (e.g., multiple load balancers, web servers, replica databases) in the case of failure. As part of regular maintenance, servers are taken out of operation without impacting availability.\n\nBusiness Continuity and Disaster Recovery\n\nNabla keeps encrypted backups of data in multiple regions on Google Cloud Platform. While never expected, in the case of production data loss (i.e., primary data stores lost), we will restore organizational data from these backups.\n\nWe utilize monitoring services to alert the team in the event of any failures affecting users.\n\nIncident Response\n\nWe have a process for handling information security events which includes escalation procedures, rapid mitigation and communication.\n\nAccess Security\n\nPhysical Access Control\n\nNabla is hosted on Google Cloud Platform. Google data centers feature a layered security model, including extensive safeguards such as:\n\nCustom-designed electronic access cards\n\nAlarms\n\nVehicle access barriers\n\nPerimeter fencing\n\nMetal detectors\n\nBiometrics\n\nAccording to the Google Security Whitepaper: Google data centers also implement “security measures such as laser beam intrusion detection and 24/7 monitoring by high-resolution interior and exterior cameras” to detect and track intruders. In addition, “access logs, activity records, and camera footage are available in case an incident occurs” and “experienced security guards, who have undergone rigorous background checks and training, routinely patrol” Google data centers.\n\nNabla employees do not have physical access to Google data centers, servers, network equipment, or storage.\n\nLogical Access Control\n\nNabla is the assigned administrator of its infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform, and only designated authorized Nabla operations team members have access to configure the infrastructure on an as-needed basis behind two-factor authentication. Specific private keys are required for individual servers, and keys are stored in a secure and encrypted location.\n\nLeast Privilege Access Control\n\nWe follow the principle of least privilege with respect to identity and access management.\n\nQuarterly Access Reviews\n\nWe perform quarterly access reviews of all team members with access to sensitive systems.\n\nPassword Requirements\n\nAll team members are required to adhere to a minimum set of password requirements and complexity for access.\n\nVendor and Risk Management\n\nAnnual Risk Assessments\n\nWe undergo at least annual risk assessments to identify any potential threats, including considerations for fraud.\n\nVendor Risk Management\n\nVendor risk is determined, and the appropriate vendor reviews are performed prior to authorizing a new vendor.\n\nVulnerability Disclosure\n\nAnyone can report a vulnerability or security concern with a Nabla product. Please read our Vulnerability Disclosure Policy for more information.\n\nContact Us\n\nIf you have any questions, comments or concerns or if you wish to report a potential security issue, please contact security@nabla.com.",

For longer transcripts, the generation will take few more seconds. You can either make a synchronous HTTP call, or rely on our asynchronous webhook callback which avoids blocking calls and is more resilient to network interruptions.\n\nSummarize, with a patient-friendly language, the instructions given by the healthcare provider during an encounter.\n\nExtract conditions (including the related ICD-10 codes) and family history from a given clinical note, in a FHIR-compatible format.\n\nSend live audio of a provider's dictation to our speech-to-text engine, and receive accurately transcribed text in real-time.",
      "# [Nabla on Mobile](https://help.nabla.com/en/articles/2353922)\nNabla is available on both mobile and desktop devices. This article focuses on how to access Nabla on mobile: using the web app in a browser (recommended for Android devices) or the dedicated app for iOS devices.\n\nPlease note: If your organization is integrated with Nabla, your sign-in steps may differ. Please refer to the documentation provided by your organization for specific instructions.\n\nNabla Web App\n\nHow to Access\n\nYou can access Nabla on your mobile browser by visiting copilot.nabla.com (Safari or Chrome recommended). Follow these steps to sign in:\n\nOpen copilot.nabla.com in your browser.\n\nOn the homepage, click Try Nabla or Sign in if you already have an account.\n\nIf you sign in for the first time, select your medical specialty, country of practice, and EHR, then click Next.\n\nEnter your email address and click Next.\n\nCheck your email for a verification code and enter it in Nabla.\n\nNabla iOS App\n\nIf you're using an iOS device, we recommend downloading the Nabla app for a more optimized experience.\n\nHow to Access\n\nVisit the Nabla iOS app page in the App Store or search for \"Nabla\" directly in the App Store.\n\nDownload the app.\n\nAfter downloading, follow the same sign-in process outlined above to access Nabla.\n\nUsage Scenarios\n\nYou can use Nabla on your mobile device in the following situations:\n\nIn-person encounters\n\nVirtual encounters: When using video conferencing tools like Zoom on your desktop with the speaker enabled.\n\nConverting the Web App into an App\n\nFor iPhone:\n\nOpen the Nabla web version (copilot.nabla.com) in your mobile browser.\n\nTap the Share button (square icon with an upward arrow).\n\nScroll down and select Add to Home Screen.\n\nNabla will now appear as an app on your home screen.\n\nAllow your microphone by following these steps.\n\nFor Android:\n\nOpen the Nabla web version (copilot.nabla.com) in your mobile browser.\n\nTap the three vertical dots in the top-right corner and select Add to Home Screen.\n\nNabla will now appear as an app on your home screen.\n\nPermanently Allowing Microphone Permissions on Safari (iOS)\n\nTo prevent iOS from asking for microphone permissions each time you use Nabla, you can follow these steps to permanently allow microphone access in Safari. This option is not available for Chrome, Edge, or other browsers on iOS due to Apple's security restrictions on non-Safari browsers.\n\nOpen Safari and navigate to copilot.nabla.com.\n\nTap the Aa icon in the address field.\n\nSelect Website Settings.\n\nSet the microphone to Allow.\n\nBest Practices\n\nNabla requires continuous access to your phone's microphone during encounters to maintain transcription functionality. Incoming calls may disrupt Nabla’s microphone access, affecting the ability to transcribe.\n\nTo avoid interruptions, we recommend the following best practices:\n\nEnable Do Not Disturb mode while using Nabla to eliminate disruptions.\n\nDo not lock your phone while using Nabla; keep the Web page or app open during your encounter.\n\nOn iOS, disable Low Power Mode, as it may lock your screen automatically.\n\nOn Android, disable Doze Mode (or equivalent manufacturer-specific power-saving features).\n\nIf You Receive an Incoming Call\n\nIf you receive an incoming call during your Nabla encounter, it will disrupt the microphone access on both iOS and Android. An orange screen will appear, indicating that access to the microphone has been lost. To restore access, follow these steps:"

My practice has been looking into these new AI medical scribes to help with our clinical documentation. Everyone’s pretty burned out from spending so much time on patient notes, so this seems like a really interesting solution. Are these tools safe & legit?\n\nI wanted to try DeepScribe and DAX but it seems like you have to go through sales. A friend recommended NoteMD and I’ve been trying it out for a few days. So far it’s pretty good (it doesn’t save patient recordings which is great), but sometimes it doesn’t capture a sentence or two.\n\nWhat do people think about using these? Are they safe?\n\nEDIT: Thanks all for your comments, please stop spamming me in DMs :-) Our practice ended up with NoteMD which is working great.\n\n## Comment ID ks7b78p with +34 score by [(DrTestificate_MD, Reddit, 2024-02-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7b78p/) (in reply to ID 1b0befu):\nYes some people are using them.

Captures most of what is said and knows where to put it (History, exam, A/P, PI etc). Produces paragraphs of prose. For some reason it sucks at documenting my reasoning in an A/P — wordy, misses the if-then logic. Helps a little with allowing more eye contact with patient during visit but I gave up on it. Takes me 2 min to write my own primary care notes (after a little pre-charting.) When an AI model can read my previous notes and learn how I document and reproduce my style then I’ll use it.

I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers. Full HIPAA compliance and patient information is protected.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more! You can also shoot me an email ernest.chan@getathelas.com and I'd be happy to chat more.\n\n### Comment ID kxgt1mx with +1 score by [(No_Butterfly_4596, Reddit, 2024-03-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/kxgt1mx/) (in reply to ID ktnqhk1):\nAthelas looks great but $350 a month?\n\n#### Comment ID kxlc703 with +1 score by [(ekwcq, Reddit, 2024-04-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/kxlc703/) (in reply to ID kxgt1mx):\nShoot me an email!

Hope this helps.\n\n### Comment ID l6lflvl with +1 score by [(Jackyl_and_High, Reddit, 2024-06-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/l6lflvl/) (in reply to ID l121jyh):\nCost ?\n\n#### Comment ID lc95bao with +1 score by [(DCK1D, Reddit, 2024-07-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/lc95bao/) (in reply to ID l6lflvl):\nI can get you setup at [getwava.com](http://getwava.com) for free if you are interested. all I ask is for your feedback on the software so that I can improve it.\n\n### Comment ID l6o7c3v with +1 score by [(jrs9099, Reddit, 2024-06-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/l6o7c3v/) (in reply to ID l121jyh):\n~$2500 per fte per month.\n\n## Comment ID l4n9miw with +1 score by [(elietoubi, Reddit, 2024-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/l4n9miw/) (in reply to ID 1b0befu):\nHey,  \nA ton of people reached out to me on the reddit thread.\n\nI am the CEO of [scribeMD.ai](http://scribeMD.ai) ...

It gives you a gender neutral HPI (i.e. uses \"they/them\" pronouns) as well as mental status exam (I'm in psychiatry) and plan.  The MSE and plan are useless, at least for me. The HPI is decent.\n\nFreed doesn't show you a transcription live but you can access it afterwards. It gives a better HPI than Nabla and you can choose gender so it sounds better than using \"they/them\" all over. It also does a more honest job at the MSE; basically never attempts to write one and says \"not enough objective data.\" It also gives a plan and after visit summary. Both are really solid. Anything you say during the appointment in terms of plan, it'll capture. If I mention diet and exercise, it'll put in specifically what I said rather than just say \"lifestyle changes\". I have a template for plan that I prefer using so I don't actually use that part but I could easily see someone finding it useful (unlike Nabla where I don't think most people would find the generated plan sufficient). The after visit summary is gold though. Writes instructions as a letter from you to the patient, with an easy to read list of what was talked about during the appointment. \n\nIf they cut the price in half, I'd recommend Freed without any doubt. I wouldn't say it's worth a $100 a month though, especially since Nabla is free and the HPI is the main thing you want from an AI anyway, not plan or AVS.\n\n#### Comment ID k20c8mu with +9 score by [(blade24, Reddit, 2023-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k20c8mu/) (in reply to ID k1y3r77):\nWhat are the legal ramifications of these?

I can spend time with my family and have more time and energy to do things that are healthy for me. \n\nHonestly, life changing.\n\n### Comment ID kg1nkw8 with +1 score by [(Educational_Shoe5614, Reddit, 2024-01-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/kg1nkw8/) (in reply to ID kdugsuy):\nThat's amazing, congrats\n\n## Comment ID kgcl6gc with +2 score by [(elietoubi, Reddit, 2024-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/kgcl6gc/) (in reply to ID 16qm7ji):\nHey,  \nYou might want to check [scribemd.ai](https://scribemd.ai)  \nit's free to use and works great. you can see a demo here:   \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJOzQHYbv2o\n\n### Comment ID kgcrcha with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/kgcrcha/) (in reply to ID kgcl6gc):\nThanks, I'll check it out!\n\n#### Comment ID kh662yd with +2 score by [(elietoubi, Reddit, 2024-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/kh662yd/) (in reply to ID kgcrcha):\nwould love your feedback :D   \nMy email is elie(at)scribemd.ai\n\n## Comment ID ktnq70q with +1 score by [(ekwcq, Reddit, 2024-03-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/ktnq70q/) (in reply to ID 16qm7ji):\nHi! I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers. Full HIPAA compliance and patient information is protected.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more! You can also shoot me an email ernest.chan@getathelas.com and I'd be happy to chat more.\n\n## Comment ID k23jy34 with +1 score by [(toastycitrus, Reddit, 2023-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k23jy34/) (in reply to ID 16qm7ji):\nEdit\n\n### Comment ID ki1hlaw with +1 score by [(Emotional_Walrus_782, Reddit, 2024-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/ki1hlaw/) (in reply to ID k23jy34):\nCan actually do this with Heidi.

I consistently get a note that takes \\~30 seconds to edit. \\~$130/month  \n\n\nScribematic: Just started trying this out. Seems to be the best quality and pretty user friendly. You can give it templates to incorporate for each section of your exam. It has a well developed UI. Most importantly it learns from the changes you make (I don't know if anyone else does this). Downside is it's $400/mo  \n\n\nDAX/Nuance: Was not impressed. No free trial. You have to spend \\~$1200 for them to onboard you for a month then it's $700/mo after that ($600 + $100 for dragon).

I’ve been using Suki. It has direct access to my EMR and schedule so it’s as simple as clicking the patients name and starting the “note”. I access it through my phone and leave the phone near the patient and myself. It then processes the ramblings (I can be all over the place sometimes) of the visit and manages to organize it into HPI and a/p VERY accurately and in better detail than what I would normally do without it. It also does physical exam and other things like patient instructions but you’d need to speak out the physical exam which is weird. It has been life changing because it takes away the mental burden of documenting after seeing patients. I often do all my notes at lunch and then after the afternoon session because it allows me to stay on time and focus on the patient. Knowing all the details are being captured and all I need to do is organize the note a little is FANTASTIC.

These are the ones on my radar:\n\n- I have heard good things about Freed, but haven’t tried them. Their website doesn’t do a good job of showing off the potential, so I’m not sure why so many have tried it.\n- I have tried Nabla, and it seems great for the HPI section of a psychiatric intake, if you don’t mind it excluding some details. The problem is the option to add custom instructions isn’t very robust and prevents you from, say, adding a template and having the AI fill it out. It’s free to try out and easy to sign up.\n- I have heard people talk highly about Lindy AI, and it apparently can be used to automate more of your workflow than just note writing. Their CEO apparently has gotten in trouble for some shady things, but I’m very interested in trying them out.\n- Ambience Healthcare’s website had some sample transcriptions from their AI a few months ago, and I was very impressed. It’s on my radar to try soon\n- I wouldn’t recommend DeepScribe, as they historically marketed having your note ready only after several hours, which I believe is because they send the audio transcripts to employees for quality assurance, but maybe this has changed.\n- I wouldn’t recommend DeepCura. I didn’t like their UI and people have said they make it very difficult to cancel your subscription.\n- I wouldn’t recommend Amazon’s AWS Healthscribe since it’s very expensive compared to the competition.\n- Similarly, I suspect Nuance’s scribe is very expensive, as well.\n\nThere are other’s, like Suki ai, AutoScribe, iScribe, and more, but I have never heard anyone talk about these. I’m hoping r/Psychiatry can reach a consensus as to the clear favorite, but we’re not there yet. If I had to recommend some to try, I would go with the first four I mentioned.\n\n### Comment ID kt1kk1q with +5 score by [(Xvi_G, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1kk1q/) (in reply to ID kt1k11a):\nThank you\n\nI'm pretty sure it was your (this) specific response that I most wanted to revisit form the old post\n\n### Comment ID kt37dto with +2 score by [(pickyvegan, Reddit, 2024-03-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt37dto/) (in reply to ID kt1k11a):\nDeepScribe has changed- your note is ready almost immediately now.\n\n### Comment ID l0krb3x with +1 score by [(Proper_Parking_2461, Reddit, 2024-04-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/l0krb3x/) (in reply to ID kt1k11a):\nI’ve been using Twofold and its been really doing the job.

It costs me about 25 cents to do a progress note and 75 cents to do an evaluation.  I predict the costs to come down even more in the future.  Not having to type anymore during appointments - priceless.  I have arthritis in my hands so I could not stand the constant banging on the keyboard all day. It is also better because I can pay more attention to my patients and less to my keyboard.  I think my bill to Microsoft cognitive services (GPT-4 calls) is like $40-50/mo.\n\nIt also does after visit summaries for the patient. I also told it the APA criteria for CPT coding, so it helps me with that as well.\n\nMicrosoft does a BAA with everyone and says their implementation of GPT-4 is HIPAA compliant.  That being said, I don't put patients' last names into GPT-4, to keep the data somewhat deidentified.  I tried to get a BAA with OpenAI, who ignored all my messages, and I went down the rathole trying to encrypt all the PHI in the transcript, then decrypt the output.  Although it was a mistake, I did create a wonderful and effective LLM tool for automatically deidentifying and reidentifying healthcare information, though.\n\nIt works great, listens to all my patients appointments and churns out notes in the background while I work.  At the end of the day, there are my notes.  The quality of the notes is excellent. All must be proofread because the AI does occasionally make a mistake.\n\nI haven't had much luck getting it to diagnose patients or create treatment plans, not that I would trust it for such a thing, but I had some initial hopes for creating an \"AI colleague\", which were dashed.  It will scribe whatever I said to the patient during the appointment, but it doesn't seem to have any thinking or reasoning ability of its own. It is wonderful at organizing and summarizing information, though.\n\nI'm fulltime clinical, so it took me about 3 months of tinkering in my spare time to get something workable. I am a bit rusty, and had to get up to speed on all the new technology as well as teach myself Python.\n\nMy malpractice carrier advised me to get and document verbal approval from patients. After hearing about it, all except 1 said yes. She took some introductory LLM class and didn't seem to understand the technology very well, just enough to be scared of it.\n\nI have some colleagues who are working on a product called Berries ([berries.icu](https://berries.icu)).

Berries is the best thing I've seen yet in the commercial space for psychiatrists.\n\nI have CAP/MPT. The rep I spoke to seemed well aware of AI technology and had an answer ready for me.  At the end of the day, the note is still my note, and I'm responsible for its contents the same as ever, regardless of what computer tools I used to help put it together for me.\n\nI use Microsoft Azure because they gave me a BAA and they also claim their GPT-4 implementation is HIPAA compliant. ChatGPT is not HIPAA compliant regardless of whether or not they use data for training - don't ever put your patient data into Chat GPT.  I also don't put patient last names, addresses, birthdays, phone numbers, or other nonessential PHI etc into GPT-4, in order to maintain patient privacy even more. There are no laws or even regulations about this technology, but I am satisfied with the patient privacy precautions I've taken.\n\nMy state is a 2 party consent state for recording of electronic communications, so I need to document consent for that. Not that I would record my patient interviews without their consent. I don't know that you specifically need consent to share PHI with a partner for whom you have a BAA, but I do also explain the LLM technology to my patients and get their consent for it.\n\nIt was impractical to scribe a psych eval until OpenAI came out with the gpt4-32k model. Most evals are 10000+ tokens and won't fit into the 8k window gpt4 had. You could sometimes use gpt-3.5 with the 16k window, but even that was too small sometimes, and the results were not as good. These days, we have gpt4-turbo, which has a 128k token window and can handle anything I throw at it, for much less $/token to boot.\n\n### Comment ID m05kb5s with +1 score by [(Technical_Catch3880, Reddit, 2024-12-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/m05kb5s/) (in reply to ID kt2y1rx):\nThank you for this.

So far have used both MDHub and Nabla\n\nMDHub has an app that uses your phone mic, and keeps recording of your screen is off or of you switch out of the app. That's a small thing but it has a big impact on convenience of the recording. Particularly if you are working with a low talker.\n\nNabla seemed to have the slight edge in regards to the final formatting of the intake note, but I should note that I only used them utilizing their own standard formatting. I did not utilize any template other than just noting it as a new session and recording\n\nEither way, I found that for me (at this point) my best option was pasting THAT note to Chatgpt, uploading a word doc that has my tight intake format, and dictating some of my own observations that wouldn't have been transcribed from an intake note (MSE, general assessment and differential, some intangibles, etc)\n\nI also can tell chatgpt the tone I am seeking (clinical, narrative-driven, symptom focused, etc) and get a pretty good final product\n\nIt's a developing workflow that still needs  a lot of tweaking but it makes for a pretty solid final note. And while this would be too much effort for a med check, it's been a huge time saver and burnout protection for my 90 minute CAP intake evals\n\n### Comment ID kt1lrpb with +13 score by [(zpacksnackpack, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1lrpb/) (in reply to ID kt196a7):\nSounds like a great workflow! \n\nOne thing I’d note is Chat GPT is not HIPAA complaint (unless you have the super expensive enterprise version). \n\nBastion GPT is a great HIPAA compliant version you may want to check out it.\n\n#### Comment ID kt1q0ht with +8 score by [(Xvi_G, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1q0ht/) (in reply to ID kt1lrpb):\nThat's good to know about the alternate option\n\nFwiw I don't have any identifying info in my notes\n\nThat's all attached later via epic dot phrases\n\nBut certainly good to keep in mind\n\n## Comment ID kt1gj47 with +7 score by [(touchfuzzygetlit, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1gj47/) (in reply to ID 1b4uvub):\nI used FreedAI but it’s expensive like $100/month\n\n### Comment ID kt1o3nm with +2 score by [(DekkuRen, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1o3nm/) (in reply to ID kt1gj47):\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n#### Comment ID kt1qqzr with +9 score by [(colored_water, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1qqzr/) (in reply to ID kt1o3nm):\nI use freed and I love it.

To start with, multispecialty practice will offer Family medicine and mental health. Gradually, we plan to expand it. Here is what I need:\n\n1. Cloud based EHR, Practice Management that can support multiple locations. I do not want any installations on my machine. I want a web based / browser based EHR that opens up in iPad, Mac and Windows.\n\n2. Integrated telehealth rather than using Zoom or Doxy\n\n3. Patient Portal for appointment scheduling. I also need the ability to customize patient portal.\n\n4. Built-in Patient communication e.g. texting, messaging rather than using Spruce\n\n5. Billing RCM capabilities within EHR with the freedom to create services for cash based patients as well. I also want the freedom to use external biller if I want.\n\n6. Customizable templates and free text is a must since this we need it for multispecialty\n\n7. Speech to text or Dragon integration\n\n8. Medical Inventory Management since we need to track medications and supplies in various locations\n\n9. eRx and EPCS capabilities. I also want ability to send compounding drugs to Hallandale or Empower since we plan to start offer weight loss services as well.\n\n10. Customer service who responds :)\n\nI have evaluated and taken demos from DocVilla , Athena, eCW, Kareo, AdavancedMD.\n\nThe only EHR that super impressed me and has everything including cloud web based EHR, Practice Management, Patient Portal, customization capability, compounding drugs, Dictation, etc. is DocVilla EHR. There are great reviews about DocVilla's customer service as well.\n\nBefore I pull the trigger and sign the contract with DocVilla, anyone has any comments, experience, suggestions based on my needs.\n\n## Comment ID ljw7rfo with +4 score by [(Best_Doctor_MD90, Reddit, 2024-08-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthIT/comments/1euj8v0/docvilla_vs_athena_vs_ecw_vs_kareo_vs_advancedmd/ljw7rfo/) (in reply to ID 1euj8v0):\nThank you all who responded and helped me to decide on the right EHR. I signed the contract with DocVilla and I am extremely happy with them.\n\n1. DocVilla is super fast and completely web and cloud based EHR. I have tried it on Mac, Windows laptop and iPad. It works without any issues and without any VPN downloads. I was able to create 3 locations and assign providers to each location.\n\n2. The Telemedicine works out of the box. It automatically sends a link to the patient when a telehealth consult is created. It's a no brainer.\n\n3. DocVilla does have a free patient portal. But they are working on a custom patient portal for us which will take some time for development. But they understand our needs for branding and connecting with our website.\n\n4. Texting, Messaging works out of the box. So we are able to send text messages to the patients and are also able to message the patients on patient portal.\n\n5. DocVilla will be doing our billing. They will start the enrollment process. We have to provide them the payer IDs.\n\n6. DocVilla has got ton of prebuilt templates. I was also able to create templates myself using macros. I have also asked their engineering to create a few more templates for us. They are even open to any workflow customization that we might need.\n\n7. DocVilla has its own proprietary speech to text. From what I have tested so far, its very accurate. It works on Mac, Windows and iPad.\n\n8. Inventory management is prebuilt in DocVilla. I have seen the videos and it seems easy but have not yet used it.\n\n9. eRx and EPCS worked out of the box. Already tested sending prescriptions.\n\n10. The most important thing, the customer service is super responsive. It's Sunday today. I had emailed them a question in the morning. Within a few mins I got a response from DocVilla with screenshot explanation.\n\n  \nI am glad I found DocVilla EHR and made the right decision. I would highly recommend DocVilla to anyone looking for all-in-one EHR software solution.\n\n  \nI also came to know that DocVilla also offers marketing (Google, FB, Insta), Website development services. I have not yet taken a quote from them. But its great if a single company is acting as a one stop shop for the practices. I have scheduled a call with them next week to understand these ancillary technology and marketing services.\n\n### Comment ID lt1jbf0 with +2 score by [(Soggy-Phone-6391, Reddit, 2024-10-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthIT/comments/1euj8v0/docvilla_vs_athena_vs_ecw_vs_kareo_vs_advancedmd/lt1jbf0/) (in reply to ID ljw7rfo):\nOur practice has used all of the EMR's listed and we really like DocVilla. \n\nKareo used to be great, they are now the WORST! \n\n  \nGood luck with your practice :) I do medical billing coding credentialing and licensing if you ever need help feel free to reach out. \n\n[Lynchpracticemanagement@gmail.com](mailto:Lynchpracticemanagement@gmail.com)\n\n### Comment ID lk7e33o with +1 score by [(mmohiuddinkhan, Reddit, 2024-08-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthIT/comments/1euj8v0/docvilla_vs_athena_vs_ecw_vs_kareo_vs_advancedmd/lk7e33o/) (in reply to ID ljw7rfo):\nIt’s awesome to hear that you’re happy with your choice!

They do not charge anything for training and its unlimited. Not sure about online but they are part of a bigger technology company in New York. Maybe DocVilla is smaller than Athena or eCW or Kareo, but I would rather stick with a company where the customer service responds rather than have a big company where the customer service is MIA or the engineering cannot customize for my needs.\n\nOverall, DocVilla is not complicated.

I assume some users don't realize you can't just distribute the output without first ensuring it is accurate, but I've seen some very concerning results.  Not just nonsensical info, but directly contradicting statements within the larger output.  Also critical errors such as where something is discussed as a \"should do this\" but that becomes \"should not do this\" in the generated notes.  No idea what service is behind WebEx's AI or if it is homegrown, but I would never trust it for anything critical or complex and definitely would not distribute the output without a close review.  And this is coming from someone who hates taking meeting minutes!",

It's very, very glowy, which isn't necessarily flattering if you're oily skinned or have the other things going on that I mentioned. It isn't sparkly, but I often use it as a highlight. However, if you want a full coverage I've heard amazing things about their newest addition, the Soft Glam Satin Foundation. \n\n\nMaybelline's foundations are solid choices for the price range, Fit Me Matte & Poreless is a classic and for gold reason, and their skin tint also gets fabulous reviews.\n\n## Comment ID ljs9reu with +5 score by [(OkCartoonist3430, Reddit, 2024-08-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ulta/comments/1f0ffxd/tell_me_what_you_need_and_ill_try_to_help/ljs9reu/) (in reply to ID 1f0ffxd):\nI have frizzy long waivy hair what products could I use so my blowout can last more than a few hours ?\n\n### Comment ID ljsqpda with +6 score by [(Calm-Home674, Reddit, 2024-08-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ulta/comments/1f0ffxd/tell_me_what_you_need_and_ill_try_to_help/ljsqpda/) (in reply to ID ljs9reu):\nThe Shea moisture mousse is amazing.

Maybe add the moisturizer I mention below or another type of moisturizing cream \n\n3.  for your T zone I recommend the strivictin acne line. I do this after I get out the shower followed by a moisturizer because it is drying.  It works WONDERS!! \n\n4. My personal favorite for my routine that I buy regardless of price is the peach and Lily ultra plush moisturizer. It’s a God send. In general your favorite cleanser and a deep moisturerizer are a must for everyone to have. \n\nAlso. Give yourself 30 days of consistenty before deciding if it's for you or not. It can take a few weeks before our skin/bodies get used to the change. \n\nGoodluck!! ♥️🥰\n\n#### Comment ID ljszzi4 with +1 score by [(alohamora795, Reddit, 2024-08-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ulta/comments/1f0ffxd/tell_me_what_you_need_and_ill_try_to_help/ljszzi4/) (in reply to ID ljswijl):\nThank you so much! 🥰💕\n\n## Comment ID ljsezqf with +1 score by [(lo530, Reddit, 2024-08-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ulta/comments/1f0ffxd/tell_me_what_you_need_and_ill_try_to_help/ljsezqf/) (in reply to ID 1f0ffxd):\nHi any recommendations for long,dehydrated,and frizzy wavy hair that is prone to buildup.

The only thing you mentioned that could be long enough to need to retrieve from is the patient’s full medical records. But if your goal is to generate personalized treatments plans, etc. then you’re probably going to need to consolidate that information so the LLM can understand it holistically, rather than just retrieve from it.\n\nI’d start by thinking through what all your prompts should look like, and what information the LLM is going to need to have access to for each of them. If you find a step in the process where that key information can’t all fit into the prompt, then you can consider RAG solutions. At that point you’ll have a much clearer idea of what the RAG problem looks like, and in turn what the solution will need to look like.\n\n## Comment ID ldt3rl5 with +5 score by [(muditjps, Reddit, 2024-07-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1e6bic0/how_can_i_create_medical_rag_chatbot/ldt3rl5/) (in reply to ID 1e6bic0):\nI tried LLMs for a use-case around biotech research. Based on that I strongly feel that LLMs currently lack the ability to properly comprehend nuanced medical contexts. And, I'm not even talking about RAG. Besides, medical knowledge evolves and LLMs are still a blackbox to be trusted for crucial aspects such as treatment plans. \n\nThink it this way, would you make financial investments purely based on an LLM. \n\nSo first off I think ideation can be refined. In my opinion, it's better if this implemented for specific aspects. For example, there's a Paris based startup (Nabla) that automates writing of clinical notes. \n\nHowever, should you still look at technical aspects of this: \n\n1. **For RAG pipeline:** pick something that is easy to use with incremental updates. i.e. you're not dealing with a static data source but one which needs an evolving data source. Pathway is an open source option for it. [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pathwaycom/llm-app).   \n  \n2. **For improving accuracy**: Yes, you'll need something like Hybrid Indexes or at least metadata based filtering to retrieve better results. Accuracy is paramount in these cases. Most frameworks can do the job. Here are a couple of resources that I find useful:\n\n* [Metadata filtering + Vector search example](https://github.com/pathwaycom/llm-app/tree/main/examples/pipelines/slides_ai_search)\n* [Keyword + Vector search example with BM25 (quite a short video)](https://youtu.be/lYxGYXjfrNI)\n* I also checked and liked the resource shared by u/thanghaimeow!\n\n### Comment ID ldt5tyu with +3 score by [(FigureClassic6675, Reddit, 2024-07-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1e6bic0/how_can_i_create_medical_rag_chatbot/ldt5tyu/) (in reply to ID ldt3rl5):\nThank you for this brief explanation.\n\n### Comment ID ldvyp5d with +1 score by [(dontpushbutpull, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1e6bic0/how_can_i_create_medical_rag_chatbot/ldvyp5d/) (in reply to ID ldt3rl5):\nTo illustrate the point a bit more:\n\nSome time ago i wrote a lengthy technical onboarding material.

Sounds good in principle but wow, what a minefield.\n\n## Comment ID ldxe008 with +1 score by [(JacktheOldBoy, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1e6bic0/how_can_i_create_medical_rag_chatbot/ldxe008/) (in reply to ID 1e6bic0):\nWhat you're describing doesn't mention anything RAG specific per say. As mentioned by others the medical industry is very hard to break into. This is something that would take a decade with a big team and a lot of collaboration with the health industry and government bodies. Because if you're chatbot hallucinates which it will then you're going to be liable.  \n\nI am currently working on a topic similar to this professionally in a large company so I would not be able to help you as it would break my NDA. I will tell you something public, hyppocratic ai is probably the largest starup working on this problem all in at the moment. They have a 50 page paper about their \"constellation\" llm, which is a mutli-agent llm."

Nabla expanded its AI-powered clinical documentation to support additional languages beyond the existing English (US), English (UK), French, and Spanish. The enhancement aims to assist a broader range of physicians who care for patients in various languages, including regional dialects and variations. By introducing these new language options, Nabla hopes to help bridge the language barrier for the 66 million people who do not speak English as their primary language. Nabla now supports 35 international languages.\n\nExam room language barriers negatively impact the patient-physician relationship, causing confusion, distrust in physicians, a low rate of patient compliance, and poor health outcomes. At the same time, physicians who provide care in multiple languages require expanded access to AI-powered documentation tools that lead to greater efficiency and overall improved patient outcomes. Ineffective communication also has financial implications, where medical errors related to language barriers cost health systems up to $80 billion annually nationwide.\n\n\"Supporting physicians with AI assistants like ours that enhance clinical documentation regardless of the language spoken bridges a gap in care delivery and drives forward health equity initiatives,\" said Delphine Groll, co-founder and COO, Nabla. \"By expanding the languages Nabla captures, we're advancing care delivery by allowing providers to remain focused on building rapport and trust with the patient and improving the patient experience by generating clear, concise language-specific details and instructions.\"\n\nIn July 2023, Nabla was the first ambient AI assistant to launch a Spanish-language version to support physician-patient conversations. California-based health systems, including Children's Hospital Los Angeles, quickly adopted the Spanish-language version, which is used in 8% of the visits conducted with Nabla. Nabla listened closely to its customers and prospects when determining which new language versions to create. For example, prospects and clients based on the West Coast frequently requested Chinese language support to improve communications with their patient population that speaks Chinese languages. All new language versions account for the top languages spoken in the U.S.\n\nNabla's generative AI ambiently produces real-time comprehensive clinical notes in the background during physician-patient conversations. The platform also has multi-speaker functionality to ensure guardians and parents are captured when present during the exam. Switching to a different language within Nabla is simple; the provider chooses the specific language before the start of a consultation, and Nabla uses its powerful ambient AI to create detailed clinical notes in English and patient instructions in the selected language. Providing patient instructions in their preferred language improves patient engagement and treatment adherence, increases trust in the healthcare industry, and ultimately better patient health outcomes.\n\nAbout Nabla\n\nNabla is the leading ambient AI assistant, reducing practitioner stress and improving patient care. Nabla produces AI-generated clinical notes in seconds from any encounter across all specialties. Powered by proprietary LLMs, fine-tuned to the medical field, Nabla's capabilities include AI-enabled medical coding identification and smooth EHR integrations.\n\nThe company's leadership includes: Alex Lebrun (CEO), with over two decades of experience building AI products, and whose companies have been acquired by Nuance (VirtuOz) and Facebook (Wit.ai); Delphine Groll (COO) and Martin Raison (CTO). Ed Lee, MD, MPH, who was previously CIO at The Permanente Federation, recently joined Nabla as Chief Medical Officer. He heads Nabla's Clinical Advisory Board, formed by 20+ seasoned clinical leaders.\n\nOn the technological side, the company's advisors include Yann LeCun, VP & Chief AI Scientist at Meta, and Tony Fadell, inventor of the iPod and former Apple executive, among others.\n\nNabla has raised a total of $49M, its most recent fundraising being a $30M series B led by global venture capital firm Cathay Innovation.

Another very busy physician (also a leader in our group) told me today that she spends most nights typing notes. Yes Typing!

This sounds strange but I think it is somewhat comforting having Nabla there. Knowing if I need to stop typing and just listen to the person in front of me that decision isn’t going to cost me minutes and hours at the end of the day, taking time away from my family. I think this is a real trade off and decision primary care doctors make regularly. If I spend more time with a patient, try to help them and go above and beyond - that time is probably going to be taken away from sleep and family time.

      "# [Nabla CEO Alex Lebrun on the company's new funding round and its future by Steven Loeb on 2024-01-12](https://vator.tv/news/2024-01-12-nabla-ceo-alex-lebrun-on-the-companys-new-funding-round-and-its-future)\nVatorNews: Why do electronic health records make life more stressful for physicians rather than better? What could they do better?\n\nAlex Lebrun: While EHRs are critical to patient care coordination and have been key in the transition to healthcare digitization, they have unfortunately fallen short of physicians' expectations. Usability complexity has led physicians to spend more time on the EHR than patient care. According to a study from JAMIA, for every eight hours that office-based physicians have scheduled with patients, they spend more than five hours in the EHR. Challenges include data entry, interoperability, and cluttered visual display, among others. By developing the features that respond to physician time challenges, need for simplicity, and desire to streamline non-clinical tasks, EHRs can become a better ally to clinicians.\n\nVN: How does your AI assistant help them overcome some of those barriers? What tasks are you taking away that allow them to be better at their jobs?\n\nAL: Nabla Copilot generates clinical notes in seconds. Instead of having to type notes during consultations, clinicians can rely on Nabla Copilot to transcribe the entire encounter and generate an accurate clinical note that is directly integrated into the EHR. This allows providers to be entirely focused on patient care and to save an average of 2 hours per day which are usually spent on documentation. Benefits include reduced cognitive load from clerical burdens, less stress, and feelings of burnout.\n\nNabla Copilot also automates the generation of patient instructions and referral letters for example. We are also working on medical coding recognition to streamline the reimbursement process.\n\nVN: Walk me through some typical use cases for Nabla and how physicians interact with it.\n\nAL: Nabla Copilot works across specialties for in-person visits, telehealth, and phone consultations. Clinicians can either access Nabla Copilot through a desktop and mobile web app or a chrome extension. Once open, and after a quick registration process, clinicians simply click “start the consultation,” and Copilot will begin transcribing the encounter. In the end, it will generate a clinical note in about 20 seconds and provide clinicians with multiple options, available as the following features: add or delete sections, dictate content to be included, hide sections, etc. More sophisticated features include ambient dot phrases, a shortcut to automatically populate a section with pre-set content by the clinicians when mentioning a specific phrase during the consultation, or magic edit, to re-generate the note following custom instructions.\n\nClinicians use Nabla Copilot to focus entirely on their patients instead of typing, provide empathetic care, save time on administrative tasks, achieve a better work-life balance, and ultimately feel more fulfilled at work, preventing burnout.\n\nVN: What kind of ROI have you been able to calculate? Do you have hard numbers you can share?\n\nAL: There are studies that show that the median daily time spent by physicians on the EHR ranges from 3.5 to 6 hours. Consider a family physician that spends 4 hours on the EHR daily, and who’s paid about $100 an hour. On average, clinicians using Nabla Copilot report saving 2 hours/day. Nabla Copilot could save $200 per day of clinician time spent on documentation time instead of providing care. With a $119/month pricing for unlimited consultations, the ROI is immediate.\n\nVN: Do you typically sell to hospitals and healthcare groups or individual physicians? How many physicians are now using Nabla?\n\nAL: We have the capacity to cater to the unique needs of both small practices and large health systems with 10,000+ clinicians. Individual physicians can start using Nabla Copilot for free through a readily accessible web app, mobile app, and Chrome extension. Beyond 30 consultations/month, they can purchase a subscription for unlimited consultations. Our product-led growth, which relies on word of mouth, has led to individual users becoming our best ambassadors, pushing for organization-wide implementation in bigger health structures and making the adoption of Nabla Copilot a matter of weeks. Today, 20,000+ clinicians are using Nabla Copilot.\n\nVN: Which additional languages will you be adding and why those in particular?\n\nAL: We are planning on including Mandarin, Russian and Arabic. It’s a mix of the languages most spoken in the US, as well as worldwide.\n\nVN: What is your ultimate goal with Nabla? What will success look like for you?\n\nAL: To become the ambient AI assistant of reference for millions of healthcare professionals across the US and the world, assisting clinicians on a variety of tasks across the clinical spectrum, ultimately until diagnosis. With that, achieving our mission to bring back the joy of practicing medicine to clinicians and patients enjoying better healthcare.\n\nVN: Is there anything else I should know about the company or the new funding round?",
      "# [Nabla Bio secures $26m in Series A funding round by Vishnu Priyan on 2024-05-15](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/nabla-bio-series-a-funding/)\nUS pharmaceutical company Nabla Bio has secured $26m for generative protein design in a Series A financing round led by Radical Ventures.\n\nThe round included full participation from all existing investors.\n\nNabla has also entered strategic partnerships with Bristol Myers Squibb, AstraZeneca and Takeda.\n\nThese partnerships could exceed $550m in upfront and milestone payments, in addition to royalty payments.\n\nNabla Bio specialises in the integration of AI and wet-lab technologies for atomically precise drug design and the high-throughput evaluation of drug function.\n\nThe company’s initial focus is on antibodies that target multipass membrane proteins such as G protein-coupled receptors, ion channels and transporters.\n\nThese proteins are challenging to treat because of their membrane-integrated nature, reduced extracellular availability and structural similarity across targets.\n\nMultipass membrane proteins, which constitute two-thirds of all cell surface proteins, play a central role in controlling cell behaviour. They have long been considered the “holy grail” of protein drug development.\n\nNabla’s generative protein design platform is now making hundreds of these previously inaccessible targets available by enabling the accurate designing of conformation and target-selective antibody binders.\n\nTo enhance the patient impact of its platform, Nabla is collaborating with other pharmaceutical companies known for successful drug development.\n\nThese partnerships aim to enhance their pipelines with high-quality drug candidates targeting some of the most challenging and high-impact proteins.\n\nThey are also aimed at generating insights into disease biology and platform development.\n\nSince its launch in December 2021 with support from Khosla Ventures and Zetta Venture Partners, Nabla Bio has secured $37m in funding.\n\nNabla co-founder and CEO Surge Biswas stated: “We are unlocking new opportunities to build highly selective drugs against validated, but hard-to-drug targets with a degree of structural precision not previously possible.\n\n“We are excited to welcome Radical Ventures as our newest investor and to announce collaborations with three of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies to help us bring our work closer to patients.”",
      "# [Nabla](https://www.nabla.bio/news/denovo)\nToday, we’re thrilled to share a major advance in our ability to design antibodies fully computationally. We developed a new AI protein design system, JAM, capable of designing high quality lead antibodies de novo given just a target protein sequence and/or structure. We thoroughly experimentally validated this new approach on a range of therapeutic applications and carefully studied the therapeutic properties of these de novo antibody designs.\n\nWhere we are today\n\nRecent advances in deep learning have revolutionized our ability to predict the structures of proteins and design proteins de novo. While these tools hold enormous promise for medicine, there has been relatively little progress in using them to develop viable drugs. Antibodies, as the most established drug format, are a great first real-world test for de novo drug design. However, so far no AI systems have shown they are able to produce high quality lead antibodies from scratch in a way that is robust and generalizes across protein targets and antibody formats.\n\nOur advance\n\nWe introduce a new AI system called Joint Atomic Modeling (JAM) and use it to design de novo antibodies with good affinity, epitope-specificity, and function. We show that our antibodies have strong developability and other drug-like properties with no optimization, making it possible to replace traditional discovery with de novo design for the first time.\n\nWe show generalizability across a diverse range of soluble targets with orders of magnitude higher hit rates compared to traditional discovery, including a protein target with no known structure in the PDB. Next, we apply JAM to a set of multipass membrane proteins, which as a class are considered difficult to drug, and show for the first time we can design antibodies against them from scratch, including the first computational designed binders, of any kind, against Claudin-4 (CLDN4) and the GPCR (CXCR7). When JAM is given time to “think” and introspect on its results, we see significantly improved success rates and affinities - echoing recent trends for large language models (LLMS) and teasing the exciting possibility of “test-time scaling laws” for protein design.\n\nOur technical report is the first demonstration of de novo antibody design relevant to therapeutic discovery and the first evidence of computationally designed antibodies that can target hard-to-drug membrane proteins including GPCRs.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nWhat implications does this have for the development of new drugs?\n\nUnlocking new target space\n\nMultipass membrane proteins, like GPCRs, are notoriously challenging. Our approach enables the design of antibodies that can not only drug these targets directly but also serve as precise tools for target validation and the exploration of new biology.\n\nIntractable targets—such as tight junction proteins, disordered proteins, and transiently stable complexes—cannot be produced reliably in recombinant form, making traditional antibody development difficult. By designing antibodies entirely in silico and with high hit-rates, we bypass the need for recombinant proteins and could even directly test for antibody function from the onset of the discovery process.\n\nFaster antibody development\n\nOur results show significant efficiency gains in experimental time result from the small library sizes enabled by JAM’s high hit-rates. Importantly, this accelerates the antibody development process whilst also cutting costs.\n\nExcitingly, epitope-specificity enabled by JAM addresses a key attrition point in traditional discovery campaigns, where antibodies often fail to target the desired epitope. This boost in specificity increases the likelihood of discovering functional leads and cuts down on wasted effort.\n\nPrecisely controllable antibody behavior\n\nSpecies cross-species reactivity requirements can be used to guide epitope selection, streamlining the preclinical development process.\n\nEngineered selectivity can similarly be selected for at the epitope level, generating antibodies that either (i) target multiple related proteins with desired binding profiles, or (ii) minimizing binding to closely-related family members and/or dangerous off-targets.\n\nResults\n\nJAM designed antibodies have good affinity, specificity, developability and function within therapeutic range and exhibit strong early stage developability without any experimental optimization.\n\nGood affinity - We designed de novo antibodies against 7 disclosed (SARS-CoV-2 RDB, HER2, IL-13, PD-1, TrkA, CLDN4, CXCR7) and 1 undisclosed protein target and saw that top designs achieved double-digit to single-digit nanomolar affinities that put them within therapeutic-range for a high quality lead antibody.\n\nSpecificity - Importantly, designs made from one target rarely bound another target, suggesting good specificity. Excitingly, three VHH designs we made to Claudin-4 were over 100x more selective for Claudin-4 than three other closely related off target Claudins (3, 6, & 9). Strong selectivity like the result we saw here is critical to ensuring therapeutic antibodies are safe and can be administered at high doses to achieve the maximum therapeutic impact.\n\nEarly stage developability - We evaluated early stage developability properties of our de novo antibodies and found expression levels, monomericity, and polyreactivity at or better than leading monoclonals (mAbs). These are promising indications that these designs will behave well in manufacturing and formulation, two important hurdles to clear for a commercially viable drug.\n\nFunction - We tested the functional activity of our de novo antibodies using target-specific functional assays. For SARS-CoV-2, we measured neutralization activity using a pseudovirus assay and saw IC50 values in the sub-nanomolar range (0.65 nM). We also use epitope mapping to confirm our designed antibodies bound to the desired functional sites, providing robust evidence of disease-relevant function.\n\nWe use JAM to develop the first computationally designed antibodies against multipass membrane proteins, achieving strong affinity, specificity and desired function. This has long been considered a ‘holy grail’ of antibody engineering but has not been previously reported.\n\nMembrane Protein Targeting - We demonstrate JAM's ability to target challenging multipass membrane proteins by designing antibodies against two therapeutic targets: claudin-4 (CLDN4) and the GPCR CXCR7. To enable efficient screening of large design libraries against these membrane-bound targets, we leveraged JAM's general protein design capabilities to create soluble protein proxies (solMPMPs) that preserve the native extracellular epitopes while enabling solution-phase characterization.\n\nFor both targets, this soluble proxy strategy proved successful. Selected antibodies showed high-affinity binding to their native targets expressed on engineered cell lines, with maintained specificity. Notably, CLDN4-targeting antibodies also demonstrated binding to OVCAR3 cells, an ovarian cancer line expressing endogenous CLDN4, validating their potential therapeutic relevance. These results represent the first demonstration that computational design can generate antibodies against this historically challenging but therapeutically crucial target class.\n\nJAM shows strong signs of generalization, including to novel targets not in the training set, and demonstrates early evidence of test-time scaling laws. We show how using JAM to design experimental libraries further improves performance and compresses design and affinity optimization into a single experimental step.\n\nStrong Generalization - JAM demonstrated broad generalization across multiple dimensions of antibody design. We validated its capabilities on diverse targets by generating both single-domain antibodies (VHHs) and full-length monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), achieving comparable affinity and function across formats. Notably, JAM successfully designed high-affinity, specific antibodies to a novel target absent from the PDB, indicating genuine generalization beyond training data.\n\nScaling test-time compute - A particularly exciting finding emerged when allowed JAM to introspect on its outputs and perform multiple rounds of iterative design at inference time. By increasing these computational iterations, we observed substantial improvements: 3-fold higher success rates, 10-fold better affinities, and unexpectedly, greater structural diversity - all while maintaining developability and humanness. This previously unobserved relationship between test-time compute and protein design success warrants investigation into the best way to allocate compute between training and inference to maximize experimental success.\n\nOne-Shot Affinity Optimization - We further enhanced JAM's capabilities by combining computational design with focused experimental sampling. Using error-prone PCR to explore sequence neighborhoods around JAM-designed binders, we achieved up to 100-fold improvements in affinity, reaching picomolar binding strengths. This hybrid approach effectively compressed de novo design and affinity optimization into a single experimental step, significantly streamlining the discovery process.\n\nLimitations\n\nThere are a few things we're working on to improve JAM and to better deliver on the promise of de novo antibody design:",
      "# [Nabla raises another $24 million for its AI assistant for doctors that automatically writes clinical notes by Romain Dillet on 2024-01-05](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/05/nabla-raises-another-24-million-for-its-ai-assistant-for-doctors/)\nParis-based startup Nabla just announced that it has raised a $24 million Series B funding round led by Cathay Innovation, with participation from ZEBOX Ventures — the corporate VC fund of CMA CGM. This funding round comes just a few months after Nabla signed a large-scale partnership with Permanente Medical Group, a division of U.S. healthcare giant Kaiser Permanente.\n\nAccording to a source, Nabla has reached a valuation of $180 million following today’s funding round. The company could also end up raising more money from U.S. investors as part of this round.\n\nNabla has been working on an AI copilot for doctors and other medical staff. The best way to describe it is that it’s a silent work partner that sits in the corner of the room, takes notes and writes medical reports for you.\n\nThe startup was originally founded by Alexandre Lebrun, Delphine Groll and Martin Raison. Lebrun, Nabla’s CEO, was the CEO of Wit.ai, an AI assistant startup that was acquired by Facebook. He then became the head of engineering of Facebook’s AI research lab FAIR.\n\nA few weeks ago, I saw a live demo of Nabla with a real doctor and a fake patient pretending that they had back pains. When a physician starts a consultation, they hit the start button in Nabla’s interface and forget about their computer.\n\nIn addition to the physical examination part, a consultation also includes a long discussion with a bunch of questions about what brings you here and your medical history. At the end of the consultation, there might also be recommendations and prescriptions.\n\nNabla uses speech-to-text technology to turn the conversation into a written transcript. It works with both in-person consultations and telehealth appointments.\n\nAfter the patient has left, the doctor hits the stop button. Nabla then uses a large language model refined with medical data and health-related conversations to identify the important data points in the consultation — medical vitals, drug names, pathologies, etc.\n\nNabla generates a thorough medical report in a minute or two with a summary of the consultation, prescriptions and follow-up appointment letters.\n\nThese reports can be customized to the doctor’s needs with a personalized format for your notes. For instance, you can add instructions to make the note more concise or more verbose. Or you can ask to generate notes that follow the Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note pattern that is widely used in the U.S.\n\nDuring the demo that I saw, I was extremely surprised by the effectiveness of Nabla in general. Even though we were in a crowded room and Nabla was running on a laptop a couple of meters away from the demo presenters, the tool was able to generate an accurate transcript and a useful report.\n\nWith Nabla Copilot, as the name suggests, the startup isn’t trying to take the human out of the medical loop. Physicians still have a final say as they can edit reports before they are filed in their electronic health record system (EHR).\n\nInstead, the company thinks it can help doctors save time on admin work so that they can spend more time focusing on patients.\n\n“What we know is the near future is we don’t want to try to replace doctors. You’ve seen companies — like Babylon in the U.K. — burning $1 billion trying to do chatbots and trying to automate things right away and remove doctors from the loop. And we’ve decided a long time ago with Nabla Copilot that [doctors] are the pilots and we work by their side,” Lebrun said.\n\n“It’s a little bit like automation for autonomous vehicles. We are still at level two today. We will start level three very soon with clinical assurance support. Then level four is clinical decision support, but with FDA approval, because you make decisions that you cannot really explain,” he added.\n\nAt some point, you could even imagine a level five of autonomous healthcare, which would mean removing physicians from the room. But Lebrun is still very cautious on this front.\n\n“For some situations in some markets, like in some countries where they don’t have any access to healthcare, it would be a relevant thing,” he said. Over the long term, he sees the diagnostic process as a “pattern matching problem” that could be solved with AI. Doctors would focus on empathy, surgery procedures and critical decisions.\n\nWhile Nabla is based in France, most of the company’s customers are in the U.S. following a rollout across Permanente Medical Group. Nabla isn’t just a work in progress, it is actively used every day by thousands of doctors.\n\nNabla’s privacy model\n\nNabla is currently available as a web app or a Google Chrome extension. The company is well aware that it is handling sensitive data. That’s why it doesn’t store audio or medical notes on its servers, unless both the doctor and the patient give their consent.\n\nNabla focuses on data processing instead of data storing. After a consultation, the audio file is discarded and the transcript is stored in the EHR that doctors are already using for their patient files.\n\nIn more technical terms, when a physician starts a recording, the audio is transcribed in real time using a fine-tuned speech-to-text API. The company uses a combination of an off-the-shelf speech-to-text API from Microsoft Azure and its own speech-to-text model (a refined model based on the open source Whisper model).\n\n“When you have just a normal speech-to-text algorithm, they may or may not be good on medical data. But we have a fine-tuned one. And, as you probably have seen, the text is very light at first, and then it becomes dark. And when it becomes dark, it means that we verified it with our own model and we corrected it with medication names or medical conditions,” Nabla ML engineer Grégoire Retourné said during the demo that I saw.\n\nThe transcript is first pseudonymized, meaning that personally identifiable information is replaced with variables. Pseudonymized transcripts are processed by a large language model. Historically, Nabla has been using GPT-3 and then GPT-4 as its main large language model. As an enterprise customer, Nabla can tell OpenAI that it can’t store its data and train its large language model on those consultations.\n\nBut Nabla has also been playing with a fine-tuned version of Llama 2. “In the future, we envision using more and more narrow models as opposed to general models,” Lebrun said.\n\nOnce the LLM has processed the transcript, Nabla de-pseudonymizes the output. Doctors can see the note, which is stored on the computer in the local web browser storage file. Notes can be exported to EHRs.\n\nHowever, doctors can give their approval and ask for the patient consent to share medical notes with Nabla so that they can be used to correct transcription errors. And given that Nabla is on track to process more than 3 million consultations per year in three languages, chances are Nabla will improve really quickly thanks to real-world data.",

Dr. Lovinger advises clinical leaders to ensure the solution they choose can align seamlessly with their health system’s workflows.\n\nCarle Health chose Nabla after testing many ambient voice products; Dr. Lovinger says they are “not all created equal.” Carle Health found reaction from its clinicians to be “uniformly positive” after a four-week pilot.\n\nNot only did Nabla meet their requirements for quality and ease of use, but the company was great to work with. A team at Nabla is dedicated to training and onboarding for every roll-out. Dr. Lovinger says that unlike some vendors, Nabla is excited to hear users’ suggestions and work on new features that adapt to their needs.\n\nDr. Lovinger likes many of the features of Nabla: It reminds the doctor of things that they should advise the patient, and the AI can record more detail than the clinician remembers.\n\nNabla also “works hard” at integration with the EHR, according to Dr. Lee, who considers integration to be near or at the top of customer requirements. With a single click, a generated SOAP note goes into the Epic EHR. In addition, they can update the problem list with new diagnoses. In the future, they plan to work directly with other parts of the EHR, such as medication orders, family history, and social history.\n\nThey also want to move into automatic coding and clinical decision support.

      "# [News: AI tool for hospitals fabricates text in transcription, researchers say](https://acdis.org/articles/news-ai-tool-hospitals-fabricates-text-transcription-researchers-say)\nAmidst the many artificial intelligence (AI) tools introduced to improve documentation accuracy, one version of the AI-powered transcription tool called Whisper is being used by over 30,000 clinicians and 40 health systems to translate and transcribe patients’ consultations with doctors, MedPage Today reported. This tool built by Nabla is intended to free up medical providers to spend less time on notetaking or report writing, and it’s estimated to have been used to transcribe seven million medical visits.\n\nWhisper’s creator, OpenAI, has cautioned that the tool should not be used in “high-risk domains,” however, and three different researchers who conducted studies of the tool’s audio transcriptions found the tool is prone to making up chunks of text and even entire sentences.\n\nOne researcher from the University of Michigan told MedPage Today that he found such invented text—known in the tech industry as “hallucinations”—in eight out of every 10 audio transcriptions. A machine learning engineer analyzed over 100 hours of the Whisper transcriptions and discovered hallucinations in about half of them. A third developer said he created 26,000 transcripts with Whisper and found hallucinations in almost every one. While transcription tools are expected to misspell words and make other errors, engineers and researchers said they haven’t seen another AI-powered transcription tool hallucinate as often as Whisper.\n\nSome of the text can include racial commentary, violent rhetoric, and imagined medical treatments, experts have warned. For instance, in one transcription, Whisper invented a non-existent medication called “hyperactivated antibiotics.” Software developers said these tend to occur amid pauses, background sounds, or music playing. Unfortunately, Nabla's chief technology officer Martin Raison says it’s impossible to compare their tool’s AI-generated transcript to the original recording, because Nabla's tool erases the original audio for “data safety reasons.”\n\nParticularly in hospital settings, such mistakes could have “really grave consequences,” said Alondra Nelson, PhD, who led the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy until last year.\n\n“This seems solvable if the company is willing to prioritize it,” said William Saunders, a San Francisco-based research engineer. Earlier this year, he quit OpenAI over concerns with the company's direction. “It's problematic if you put this out there and people are overconfident about what it can do and integrate it into all these other systems.”\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson told MedPage Today that the company continually studies how to reduce hallucinations and appreciated the researchers' findings. They added that OpenAI incorporates feedback in model updates.",

      "# [Children’s Hospital Los Angeles to Roll Out Nabla Copilot Ambient AI Assistant by David Raths on 2024-03-12](https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/analytics-ai/article/53098833/childrens-hospital-los-angeles-to-roll-out-nabla-copilot-ambient-ai-assistant)\nA key area of focus these days for chief medical information officers is deploying ambient AI assistants for clinicians to record patient encounters and cut down on the burden of EHR documentation. Healthcare Innovation recently spoke with Matt Keefer, M.D., chief medical informatics officer at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles about the results of a pilot project involving Nabla Copilot.\n\nKeefer is a member of the Department of General Pediatrics at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and a clinical professor in the Department of Pediatrics at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.\n\nNabla Copilot is also in use at The Permanente Medical Group, Mankato Clinic, Frontier Psychiatry, and others.\n\nAlthough based in Paris, Nabla is focused on the U.S. healthcare market. Founded in 2018, the company has proprietary large language models and speech-to-text technologies built by former Facebook AI Research engineers.\n\nHCI: Could you talk a little bit about some of the EHR challenges your organization has had — and that hospitals in general have — that make something like Nabla’s ambient AI assistant attractive? Are there burnout issues related to EHR documentation you wanted to address?\n\nKeefer: I think I can safely say that no one went into medicine with the intent of documenting. That brings very little joy to anybody's work day. With the expansion of the EMR, there are some wonderful things, including 100 percent availability of the chart to those who need it. There are also some downsides, which involve a lot more typing, and especially for clinicians who aren't super tech-savvy, it means a lot of interaction with the system that they think is sometimes a barrier between them and their patients.\n\nHCI: There are several companies entering this ambient AI assistant space. How did your organization decide which one to work with? What drew you to Nabla?\n\nKeefer: We certainly did look around at some of the different options. One of the things that really drew us to Nabla was the responsiveness of the team, the interest in improving the product with us and being able to understand how our clinicians were interacting with the patients. In particular, we have a fairly large percentage of our patients and families who speak languages other than English, Spanish being the predominant one. They were very open to understanding that workflow, and trying to ensure that we could could be as as efficient as possible with that.\n\nHCI: You conducted a pilot with 30 pediatric specialists. What are some things you had to tailor specifically for the pediatric hospital setting?\n\nKeefer: We have surgical subspecialties, medical subspecialties, and general pediatrics, and clearly those all have slightly different variations in terms of how their visits go. We also deliberately chose people in different parts of their career — senior faculty, junior faculty, those who are tech-savvy, those who weren’t, and some who were already using things for dictation. We worked with the general pediatricians to come up with a better template for keeping track of information that you would have in a typical well-child exam. Nabla was able to respond to specific requests for how to format the note in a way that would be germane to a pediatrician.\n\nHCI: What about integration with your Oracle Cerner EHR? Is that something that came right out of the box, or did you have to do some work on that?\n\nKeefer: I would say that no integration comes without some work. Certainly, that was one of the other things that we really enjoyed working with Nabla on. We came up with workflows that worked for integration with Oracle Health, and the team from Nabla had already been connected with them, and we're working on on the next steps to further that integration.\n\nHCI: Were there things that you wanted to measure during the pilot in terms of doctor-patient interactions or clinician time spent documenting to see some improvement before moving on to a larger implementation?\n\nKeefer: We did. We have Oracle Health data to look at time documenting after hours and things like that. We also did structured questionnaires with all the pilot users, and the Nabla team has them rate the notes to give them feedback on on the quality of the notes and what needed to be changed.\n\nHCI: Do you feel positive enough now that you're going to roll it out organization-wide?\n\nKeefer: Yes. We’re hoping to start that up with a group of 27 pediatricians next week. We also want to try use cases outside of just the physicians. So we're working with social workers and some other team members, such as psychologists — anybody who has a narrative experience with the patient.\n\nAlso joining the conversation were Nabla CEO and co-founder Alex Lebrun and Chief Medical Officer Ed Lee, M.D.\n\nHCI: Dr. Lee, tell us about your background and how you came to Nabla?\n\nLee: I am an internal medicine primary care physician. I've been with Nabla as the chief medical officer officially for about three weeks now, but I've actually been working with Nabla for quite some time. I previously served as the chief information officer for the Permanente Federation, which is sort of a consulting advisory body to the Permanente Medical Group. I was in that role for about five years and with Kaiser Permanente for over 20 years as a practicing clinician and I still practice there now.\n\nIn the pilot work that we did with Nabla early on at Permanente, we actually did see a decrease in time in charting anywhere from 25 to 30 percent within each particular encounter. If you’ve got 20-plus encounters per day, that adds up to a couple hours per day.\n\nHCI: What are some things that distinguish Nabla from the competitors entering this space?\n\nLebrun: I think the fact that we start from physicians, from the users, and go bottom up is a very, very big differentiation. We push our product directly to physicians. Actually, there is a free version that they can use for free for up to 30 encounters per month. And then they become our champions. So we start to have users inside the organizations and they become our champions and eventually, we have enterprise contracts.\n\nThat has big consequences, because since we designed the product to be self-service, you should understand it in two minutes by yourself without any training. Otherwise these bottom-up approaches don't work. So it is very easy to deploy. This is one of the differences.\n\nSomething else is we recognized from the start that every organization has different processes. I've never met two physicians who agree on what is a best note. So we know we need to customize. It's more like a platform that we need to customize for every customer. For instance, pediatrics was very different for us because there are maybe two parents, two children and one interpreter in the room. It's very complicated. We had never seen that before. But we could adapt the product in a few weeks to support that. We don't see this as an off-the-shelf product, but more as a platform that we can very quickly adapt to every customer. So we think this makes us a little bit different due to our ability to do that.\n\nLee: That's how I originally heard of it at Kaiser Permanente. We had some users try the free version. Then they started contacting me and said, ‘Hey, have you seen that? We need to get this here within our organization.’\n\nOne of the things that attracted Kaiser to Naba was their responsiveness, their innovation, their ability to really partner. I love the word partner rather than the word vendor because they really did come in and listen to our needs, adapt to our needs, and then build and customize. Every physician writes notes in the way they want to write it. It's a very personal thing, actually. And so the different type of customization options that are built in weren't initially built in with Nabla, but through the partnership they were built in, and I think that's a similar experience that Dr. Keefer may have had at CHLA as well.",
      "# [powered clinical note platform by MARIA DEUTSCHER, PAUL GILLIN, GUEST AUTHOR, DEVONY HOF on 2024-01-05](https://siliconangle.com/2024/01/05/nabla-raises-24m-ai-powered-clinical-note-platform/)\nNabla Technologies, a startup helping medical professionals create clinical notes faster, today announced that it has closed a $24 million funding round.\n\nThe Series B investment was led by Cathay Innovation with participation from ZEBOX Ventures. It brings Boston-based Nabla’s total outside funding to more than $43 million.\n\nMedical professionals spend up to several hours per week writing clinical notes, brief documents that describe a patient’s medical condition. They often also contain related information such as treatment plans. Nabla has developed an artificial intelligence platform, dubbed the Nabla Copilot, that can generate clinical notes automatically to save time for physicians.\n\nThe company says that its platform is powered by internally-developed large language models. Its model development team includes former engineers from Meta Platforms Inc.’s AI research group. The company counts Meta’s chief AI scientist, deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun, among its advisers.\n\nNabla’s Copilot platform generates clinical notes based on information that patients share during doctor’s visits. According to the company, setting up its platform before an appointment takes about 30 seconds. Copilot can be used during both in-person medical consultations and telehealth sessions.\n\nThe platform generates clinical notes in two steps. First, it creates a transcript that captures the remarks of both the patient and doctor who participated in a medical consultation. From there, Copilot distills the transcript into a clinical note that summarizes key details such as the patient’s medical condition, symptoms and treatment plan.\n\nThe platform also automates the task of loading clinical information into a healthcare organization’s EHR, or electronic health record, system. Nabla says Copilot doesn’t retain the transcripts and notes it generates. The platform is compatible with the U.S. healthcare sector’s HIPAA data protection regulation as well as the European Union’s GDPR privacy law.\n\nNabla claims that Copilot can save up to two hours of manual work per day for physicians, leaving them with more time to provide patient care. The company also promises to help medical professionals ensure that the data in their clinical notes is accurate. According to Nabla, only 5% of the AI-generated notes created using its platform require manual editing.\n\nThe company launched Copilot last March and has since built up an installed base of more than 20,000 physicians. Following the Series B funding round it announced today, Nabla plans to expand the platform with several new features including support for more languages. The company will also work to widen the adoption of Copilot among healthcare organizations in the U.S.\n\n“Clinical documentation is only the beginning for Nabla,” said Nabla co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Alex Lebrun (pictured, right, with co-founders Laurent Landowski and Delphine Groll). “Health systems are looking to leverage the AI opportunity to support their healthcare teams in many different aspects; we are getting ready to be there every step of the way.”\n\nNabla’s Copilot faces competition from several similar offerings including AWS HealthScribe, a cloud service that Amazon Web Services Inc. debuted last July. It uses Amazon Bedrock, another AWS service that provides managed generative AI models, to generate clinical notes.\n\nPittsburgh-based startup Abridge AI Inc. also offers a platform that automates the creation of clinical documentation. In 2022, the company raised a $12.5 million funding round that included the participation of prominent AI researcher Yoshua Bengio. Bengio shared the 2018 Turing Award with LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton for their work on deep learning models.\n\nPhoto: Nabla",

Nabla said Whisper has been used to transcribe approximately seven million medical visits, according to the report.\n\nA spokesperson for that company cited a blog posted on Monday that addresses the specific steps the company takes to ensure models are appropriately used and monitored in usage.\n\n\"Nabla detects incorrectly generated content based on manual edits to the note and plain language feedback,\" the company said in the blog. \"This provides a precise measure of real-world performance and gives us additional inputs to improve models over time.\"\n\nOf note, Whisper is also integrated into some versions of OpenAI’s flagship chatbot ChatGPT, and is a built-in offering in Oracle and Microsoft’s cloud computing platforms, according to the AP.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI warns users that the tool should not be used in \"high-risk domains\" and recommends in its online disclosures against using Whisper in \"decision-making contexts, where flaws in accuracy can lead to pronounced flaws in outcomes.\"\n\n\"Will the next model improve on the issue of large-v3 generating a significant amount of hallucinations?,\" one user asked on OpenAI's GitHub Whisper discussion board on Tuesday. A question that was unanswered at press time.\n\n\"This seems solvable if the company is willing to prioritize it,” William Saunders, a San Francisco-based research engineer who left OpenAI earlier this year, told the AP. \"It’s problematic if you put this out there and people are overconfident about what it can do and integrate it into all these other systems.\"\n\nOf note, OpenAI recently posted a job opening for a health AI research scientist, whose chief responsibilities would be to \"design and apply practical and scalable methods to improve safety and reliability of our models\" and \"evaluate methods using health-related data, ensuring models provide accurate, reliable and trustworthy information.\"\n\nTHE LARGER TREND\n\nIn September, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced a settlement with Dallas-based artificial intelligence developer Pieces Technologies over allegations that the company's generative AI tools had put patient safety at risk by overpromising accuracy. That company uses genAI to summarize real-time electronic health record data about patient conditions and treatments.\n\nAnd in a study looking at LLM accuracy in producing medical notes by the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Mendel, an AI company focused on AI hallucination detection, there were many errors.\n\nResearchers compared Open AI's GPT-4o and Meta's Llama-3 and found of 50 medical notes, GPT had 21 summaries with incorrect information and 50 with generalized information, while Llama had 19 errors and 47 generalizations.\n\nON THE RECORD\n\n\"We take this issue seriously and are continually working to improve the accuracy of our models, including reducing hallucinations,\" a spokesperson for OpenAI told Healthcare IT News by email Tuesday.\n\n\"For Whisper use on our API platform, our usage policies prohibit use in certain high-stakes decision-making contexts, and our model card for open-source use includes recommendations against use in high-risk domains. We thank researchers for sharing their findings.\"",

According to the Associated Press, a University of Michigan researcher said that he found made-up text in 80% of the AI tool’s transcriptions that were inspected, which led to him trying to improve it.\n\nAI hallucination isn’t a new phenomenon, and researchers have been trying to fix this using different tools like semantic entropy. However, what’s troubling is that the Whisper AI audio transcription tool is widely used in medical settings, where mistakes could have deadly consequences.\n\nFor example, one speaker said, “He, the boy, was going to, I’m not sure exactly, take the umbrella,” but Whisper transcribed, “He too a big piece of a cross, a teeny, small piece … I’m sure he didn’t have a terror knife so he killed a number of people.” Another recording said, “two other girls and one lady,” and the AI tool transcribed this as “two other girls and one lady, um, which were Black.” Lastly, one medical-related example showed Whisper writing down “hyperactivated antibiotics” in its output, which do not exist.\n\nNabla, an AI assistant used by over 45,000 clinicians\n\nDespite the above news, Nabla, an ambient AI assistant that helps clinicians transcribe the patient-doctor interaction, and create notes or reports after the visit, still uses Whisper. The company claims that over 45,000 clinicians across 85+ health organizations use the tool, including Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and Mankato Clinic in Minnesota.\n\nEven though Nabla is based on OpenAI’s Whisper, the company’s Chief Technology Officer, Martin Raison, says that its tool is fine-tuned in medical language to transcribe and summarize interaction. However, OpenAI recommends against using Whisper for crucial transcriptions, even warning against using it in “decision-making contexts, where flaws in accuracy can lead to pronounced flaws in outcomes.”\n\nThe company behind Nabla says that it’s aware of Whisper’s tendency to hallucinate and that it’s already addressing the problem. However, Raison also said that it cannot compare the AI-generated transcript with the original audio recording, as its tool automatically deletes the original audio for data privacy and safety. Fortunately, there’s no recorded complaint yet against a medical provider due to hallucination by their AI notes-taking tools.\n\nEven if that’s the case, William Saunders, a former OpenAI engineer, said that removing the original recording could be problematic, as the healthcare provider wouldn’t be able to verify if the text is correct. “You can’t catch errors if you take away the ground truth,” he told the Associated Press.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter\n\nGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.\n\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nNevertheless, Nabla requires its users to edit and approve transcribed notes. So, if it could deliver the report while the patient is still in the room with the doctor, it would give the healthcare provider a chance to verify the veracity of its results based on their recent memory and even confirm information with the patient if the data delivered by the AI transcription is deemed inaccurate.\n\nThis shows that AI isn’t an infallible machine that gets everything right — instead, we can think of it as a person who can think quickly, but its output needs to be double-checked every time. AI is certainly a useful tool in many situations, but we can’t let it do the thinking for us, at least for now.\n\nContributing Writer\n\nJowi Morales is a tech enthusiast with years of experience working in the industry.

      "# [Health care’s ‘Pepsi challenge’: Doctors’ offices are testing AI tools in head-to-head pilots by Katie Palmer on 2024-07-30](https://www.statnews.com/2024/07/30/generative-ai-health-care-adoption-ambient-scribes/)\nThe “Pepsi challenge” of health care, as one health system executive put it, is on. In the race to test generative AI in medicine, ambient scribes — which listen in to the audio of a visit and turn it into a structured clinical note for the electronic health record — are leading the pack. And to find the right scribe at the right price, health systems are pitting them against each other.\n\nThe latest update of STAT’s Generative AI tracker captures nearly 90 health systems experimenting with ambient scribes — many in small pilots, but some committing to full implementation. They span from online-only telehealth companies to federally qualified health centers, though the majority of early adopters remain large, research-focused academic medical centers, many of which are developing and marketing their own tools using generative AI.\n\nadvertisement\n\nA half-dozen companies dominate AI scribe contracts with these health systems, including Microsoft’s Nuance, Nabla, and Epic-partnered Abridge. But analysis from Gartner has found more than 50 companies providing automated medical documentation for providers. In this crowded field, many health systems are pitting two and three competing products in head-to-head pilots to see which makes the cut."
