This sounds strange but I think it is somewhat comforting having Nabla there. Knowing if I need to stop typing and just listen to the person in front of me that decision isn’t going to cost me minutes and hours at the end of the day, taking time away from my family. I think this is a real trade off and decision primary care doctors make regularly. If I spend more time with a patient, try to help them and go above and beyond - that time is probably going to be taken away from sleep and family time.

While golfing in Idaho this weekend, another surgeon told me “I would rather deal with human waste, than spend extra time documenting my visits.” He has a scribe. Another very busy physician (also a leader in our group) told me today that she spends most nights typing notes. Yes Typing! All of this is to say that the normal medical provider is disconnected from the options out there because they are too busy and entrenched to see what is out there.\n\nRead more\n\nJun 7, 2023\n\nMatt MadsenFamily Medicine\n\nI am a resident physician in Fort Saint John British Columbia. I just can't stop talking about your product to colleagues and friends. I imagine I am not the only one doing this. This product is just amazing. I was wondering if the group were at all interested in having a physician representative in Canada? If not, is there a chance to buy shares in the company? I just really believe in this product.

Voice to text (Dragon), templates, pick lists, and even live scribes are now in the rear view mirror. Looking forward to returning to work tomorrow!

Adding the follow-up appointment, prescription, and plan is wonderful. Overall, I am very pleased with how this turned out.

These databases are located in the region you choose when you create your organization.\n\nEncryption at Rest\n\nAll data is encrypted at rest using AES-256. Google Cloud Platform stores and manages data cryptography keys in its redundant and globally distributed Key Management Service. So, if an intruder were ever able to access any of the physical storage devices, the Nabla data contained therein would still be impossible to decrypt without the keys, rendering the information a useless jumble of random characters.\n\nEncryption at rest also enables continuity measures like backup and infrastructure management without compromising data security and privacy.\n\nEncryption in Transit\n\nNabla exclusively sends data over HTTPS transport layer security (TLS) encrypted connections for additional security as data transits to and from the application and APIs.\n\nVulnerability Scanning\n\nWe perform vulnerability scanning and actively monitor for threats.\n\nLogging and Monitoring\n\nWe actively monitor and log various cloud services.\n\nHigh Availability\n\nEvery part of the Nabla service uses properly-provisioned, redundant servers (e.g., multiple load balancers, web servers, replica databases) in the case of failure. As part of regular maintenance, servers are taken out of operation without impacting availability.\n\nBusiness Continuity and Disaster Recovery\n\nNabla keeps encrypted backups of data in multiple regions on Google Cloud Platform. While never expected, in the case of production data loss (i.e., primary data stores lost), we will restore organizational data from these backups.\n\nWe utilize monitoring services to alert the team in the event of any failures affecting users.\n\nIncident Response\n\nWe have a process for handling information security events which includes escalation procedures, rapid mitigation and communication.\n\nAccess Security\n\nPhysical Access Control\n\nNabla is hosted on Google Cloud Platform.

      "# [tuned language models imitate doctors? · Nabla](https://www.nabla.com/blog/cedille/)\nBack\n\nCan large fine-tuned language models imitate doctors?\n\nTL;DR\n\nCedille is a new open source French language model created by Coteries. It is trained to understand and write French and is also the largest model of its kind for French. Cedille is trained using large databases of publicly available content on the internet filtered for toxic content.\n\nGiven a medical question, it's able to generate credible answers, but those answers are often wrong or unsafe. Using it to generate doctor answers is clearly out of question. However its ability to \"understand\" the question and give a short summary could be useful.\n\nCedille\n\nCedille is based on GPT-J, the 6 billion parameter model trained by the EleutherAI community. It is trained on 78 billion tokens (equivalent to 300 gigabytes of text) of French text from the C4 dataset. It took 12 days of computing on a v3-128 TPU to release the “Boris” version of the model, named after the famous French writer and singer Boris Vian.\n\nWhat use case ?\n\nAt Nabla, we believe in asynchronous care which relies on messaging between patients and doctors. We have been working on providing our doctors super powers so that they can focus on the care with tools like autocompletion, fact extraction, categorisation... Most of these tools are text-based and use Natural Language Processing (NLP) models at some point of the process. Cedille claims to be the best model for French NLP and is in fact based on GPT-J which itself is inspired by the well-known GPT-3. These kinds of models are mostly used to generate text, but by tweaking them a bit, we can use them to extract data from text as well. Anyway, we had to test it and see what it's capable of.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nNabla is a healthcare platform allowing users to chat with a medical team. All doctors are human doctors, the tools developed by the engineering team aim at helping doctors, not replacing them. All the data used in this experiment was carefully deidentified as required by law before it was handled by our data engineers.\n\nThe experiment\n\nWe are trying to generate a doctor's answer to a new patient question. The only context the model has is the text from the patient message. All examples below are anonymized versions of messages we received from patients.\n\nWe gave this model a question in the following form:\n\nPATIENT: Je suis sous optimizette depuis plus d'un mois et j'ai des règles très\n\nirrégulières et quasi permanentes, est ce que c'est normal?\n\nDOCTOR:\n\nThe DOCTOR: at the end of the input suggests to the model that this text needs to be completed by a doctor message. (The text generation is limited to 240 tokens for technical reasons, some messages will be cut short).\n\nUsing the model as is\n\nUsing Cedille out of the box gives OK results but messages don't look at all like messages from Nabla doctors and leak personal informations (Dr Charvet). Here are a few examples, messages on the right side have been generated by Cedille from the preceding patient message:\n\n![PATIENT: On m'a posé un stérilet au cuivre il y a exactement un mois, depuis j'ai des saignements\\ quelques peu anarchiques, et irréguliers et des douleurs au bas du ventre Est-ce normal?\n\nDOCTOR: A priori oui! L'IRRÉGULARITÉ DES SAIGNEMENTS AVEC UN STÉRILET AU CUIVRE EST NORMALE Par Dr. Christelle Charvet le 6 Octobre 2013](/uploads/cedille-1.png)\n\n![PATIENT: Bonjour! J'ai eu ma première injection du vaccin Pfizer aujourd'hui et j'ai réservé ma deuxième dose le 12 août, soit 22 jours après Mais il est inscrit sur mon certificat de première dose que je dois réaliser la deuxième à partir du 15 août Or, je pars en vacances le 20 août et j'aimerais pouvoir avoir mon pass sanitaire avant de partir, si je fais ma deuxième dose le 12 août je l'aurais, si non non.. Pensez-vous que je peux me faire vacciner le 12 ou faut-il attendre le 15? Merci pour votre réponse!\n\nDOCTOR: Oui, pas de problèmes, vous pouvez avoir votre vaccin à partir du 12 août. Vous pouvez également le faire à partir du 15 août. Je vous donne cette information car j'ai récemment reçu un cas similaire à celui qui vous préoccupe.](/uploads/cedille-2.png)\n\nFine tuning\n\nFine-tuning in NLP (Natural Language Processing) refers to the procedure of re-training a little bit of a pre-trained language model using your own custom data. As a result of the fine-tuning procedure, the weights of the original model are updated to account for the characteristics of the domain data and the task you are interested in.\n\nIn our experiment, we wanted the model to give answers that look like a certain type of Nabla doctor’s messages, with greetings and a reminder of the medical context. So we used all anonymised Nabla conversations of this type and show them to the model, expecting it to learn the style and tone of our amazing health team.\n\nFine-tuning Cedille to specialize it on a task is not straightforward. The model has about 24GB of weights and even in half precision will not fit in any modern GPUs for training (considering you have to load the optimizer and the gradients on the gpu too).\n\nUsing Deepspeed by Microsoft, we managed to offload the optimizer to the CPU as well as some parameters (at the cost of cpu / gpu bandwidth), and split the model to achieve model parallelism on two Nvidia Tesla A100.\n\nWe trained it for 2 epochs on about 6000 conversations.\n\nResults\n\nHere are a few examples of what our fine-tuned model can do in various situations. Messages on the right have been generated by our model from the preceding patient message.\n\nShort and straightforward questions:\n\nExample A.1 ![PATIENT: Bonjour, s'il vous plait, un rendez-vous chez le psychiatre est-il remboursé par la secu?\n\nDOCTOR: Bonjour @patient_username, Vous vous interrogez sur le remboursement des consultations psychiatriques par la Sécurité sociale. Le psychiatre n'est pas un médecin \"interniste\" (c'est-à-dire spécialisé uniquement dans le diagnostic et la prise en charge des maladies neurologiques et de l'appareil génital). Cependant, la consultation psychiatrique peut être intégrée dans un suivi médical général et donc rembourser par l'assurance maladie. Pour bénéficier d'un meilleur parcours de soins, il est conseillé de choisir un psychiatre exerçant en centre de santé mentale (CSAPA, CMP ou hôpital de jour) ou en cabinet libéral. Bonne journée,](/uploads/cedille-3.png)\n\nExample A.2 ![PATIENT: En cas de vaginisme, puis-je faire un bilan urodynamique?\n\nDOCTOR: Bonjour @patient_username, Vous vous interrogez sur la possibilité de réaliser des bilans uro-dynamiques lorsque l'on est vaginiste. Je comprends que cela puisse être une source d'inquiétude pour vous. Je vais tenter de vous apporter quelques éléments de réponse. Les vaginistes sont des personnes qui s'interrogent beaucoup sur leur périnée. C'est un ensemble de muscles constituant le plancher pelvien. Il s'agit du muscle le plus puissant de notre corps. Il se situe entre notre utérus et nos organes sexuels. Il nous permet de nous retenir quand nous sommes enceintes, de porter des charges lourdes, de saigner après un accouchement, d'uriner, de déféquer... C'est le muscle qui](/uploads/cedille-4.png)\n\nExample A.3 ![PATIENT: On m'a posé un stérilet au cuivre il y a exactement un mois, depuis j'ai des saignements quelques peu anarchiques, et irréguliers et des douleurs au bas du ventre Est-ce normal?\n\nDOCTOR: Bonjour @patient_username, Vous vous interrogez sur la normalité de saigner après la pose d'un DIU (dispositif intra-utérin). Le DIU est un petit dispositif en forme de T, inséré à l'intérieur de l'utérus par un gynécologue, une sage-femme ou un généraliste pour une durée maximale de 4 ans (mais il est tout à fait possible de le retirer avant). Il libère de la progestérone en continu pour épaissir l'endomètre et donc faciliter l'accouchement. Les effets indésirables les plus fréquents de ce DIU hormonal sont :\n\nspottings (saignements anarchiques de faible abondance)\n\nacné\n\nprise de poids\n\nbaisse de libido\n\nnausées/vomissements Ces](/uploads/cedille-5.png)\n\nExample A.4 ![PATIENT: Je suis sous optimizette depuis plus d'un mois et j'ai des règles très irrégulière et quasi permanente est ce que c'est normal?\n\nDOCTOR: Bonjour @patient_username, Vous vous interrogez sur l'irrégularité de votre cycle. Optimizette est une pilule micro-progestative. Cela signifie que cette pilule ne contient pas d'œstrogènes, mais uniquement un progestatif (une hormone stéroïdienne qui bloque la mobilité des spermatozoïdes et modifie la paroi de l'utérus pour empêcher la grossesse). Ce type de contraception a des effets variables selon les femmes :\n\nChez certaines, cela occasionne des spottings (saignements légers anarchiques répétés). Cela est dû à son faible dosage et à l'absence d'oestrogène. Il faut laisser le temps au corps de s'y habituer. Ces saignements sont parfaitement normaux et ne diminuent pas l'efficacité de la pilule](/uploads/cedille-6.png)\n\nWith these 4 example, we can notice:\n\nIt writes coherent sentences with a coherent structure. Punctuation is good and makes for overall readable pieces of text.\n\nIt can enumerate stuff in a list form and uses parenthesis for asides.\n\nIt is able to output French letters like in Œstrogène or spermatozoïdes but only some of the times. Most of the time grammar and spelling is good.\n\nWe can also see that it learned very well the structure of messages from Nabla doctors with greetings containing the username of the patient followed by a summary of the issue or question.\n\nNow for the bad stuff:\n\nIn example A.1 and A.2, it created the words \"interniste\" and \"vaginiste\" and their definitions it proudly gives, which is pretty bad.\n\nPast the first paragraph the model seems to improvise on subjects it has picked up in the question but doesn't really answer it.\n\nQuestions with a richer and more difficult context:\n\nExample B.1.a ![PATIENT: Bonjour! J'ai eu ma première injection du vaccin Pfizer aujourd'hui et j'ai réservé ma deuxième dose le 12 août, soit 22 jours après Mais il est inscrit sur mon certificat de première dose que je dois réaliser la deuxième à partir du 15 août Or, je pars en vacances le 20 août et j'aimerais pouvoir avoir mon pass sanitaire avant de partir, si je fais ma deuxième dose le 12 août je l'aurais, si non non.. Pensez-vous que je peux me faire vacciner le 12 ou faut-il attendre le 15? Merci pour votre réponse!\n\nDOCTOR: Bonjour @patient_username, Je comprends que vous avez reçu votre premières injection du Pfizer le 19 juillet et que vos prochaines injections sont prévues le 12 et le 15 aout. Vous vous interrogez sur la nécessité d'attendre 15 jours avant votre prochaine injection ou si vous pouvez la faire plus tôt. Il est vrai qu'il est recommandé de laisser un intervalle de temps d'au moins deux semaines entre les deux injections. Cependant, dans certains cas, il est possible d'avoir recours à un délai plus court. C'est le cas lorsque la personne a déjà eu la Covid-19 ou lorsqu'elle est immunisée contre le SARS-CoV-2. Dans votre cas, vous semblez être dans le cas où il](/uploads/cedille-7.png)\n\nExample B.1.b ![PATIENT: Bonjour! J'ai eu ma première injection du vaccin Pfizer aujourd'hui et j'ai réservé ma deuxième dose le 12 août, soit 22 jours après Mais il est inscrit sur mon certificat de première dose que je dois réaliser la deuxième à partir du 15 août Or, je pars en vacances le 20 août et j'aimerais pouvoir avoir mon pass sanitaire avant de partir, si je fais ma deuxième dose le 12 août je l'aurais, si non non.. Pensez-vous que je peux me faire vacciner le 12 ou faut-il attendre le 15? Merci pour votre réponse!\n\nDOCTOR: Bonjour @patient_username, Je comprends que vous vous inquiétez d'un décalage entre la date prévue pour la 2ᵉ injection de Pfizer et la date de vos prochaines règles. Rassurez-vous, il n'y a pas d'inquiétude à avoir, le délai entre les 2 injections est strictement réglementé par les autorités de santé et doit être d'au moins 15 jours. Votre médecin a dû vous le préciser lors de votre téléconsultation. En ce qui concerne la fertilité, le COVID-19 n'a pas provoqué de stérilité chez les femmes qui ont présenté le virus, les études sont en cours et interrogent des milliers de femmes vaccinées sur leurs cycles. Rien n'est encore validé, cela dev](/uploads/cedille-8.png)\n\nB.1.a seems to be a reasonable answer. The \"summary of the question\" part is great. It repeated explicit dates and almost got the implicit one (missed by a few days). But the rest of the messages missed the point again and just talks about global rules about the vaccine, not strictly related to the current question.\n\nOne good thing is that it got the \"covid-19\" context without any explicit mentions of it (only \"Pfizer\" and \"pass sanitaire\").\n\nThe real problem is exposed in example B.1.b which is another run of the same model that came with the same score which means that the model is as confident in the quality of both answers.\n\nThis time the model completely misses the point, hallucinating some questions about the vaccine safety.\n\nExample B.2.a\n\n![PATIENT: Bonjour, J'ai pratiqué le frotti frotta avec mon copain. Sans vêtement ni protection, ni pénétration. Il a éjaculé sur mon bas ventre. J'ai un retard de règles. Qu'en pensez vous? Que dois je faire? Sachant que je stresse énormément de l'absence de mes règles. La date de mes anciennes règles : 15 février 2021 Dernier frotti frotta : 21 mars 2021 Bien à vous\n\nDOCTOR: Bonjour @patient_username, Vous avez eu des rapports sexuels non protégés (sans préservatif) avec votre copain et il a éjaculé sur vous. Vous êtes donc enceinte et vous vous demandez ce que vous devez faire. Tout d'abord, félicitations pour cette grossesse! Je comprends que cela vous inquiète et je vais tenter de répondre au mieux à votre question. Lorsqu'un homme éjacule en dehors d'une relation sexuelle avec une femme, cela s'appelle un \"éjaculation prématurée\". Il s'agit d'un phénomène fréquent et bénin, mais qui peut être très gênant pour la femme. En effet, le liquide pré-séminal qui s'accumule dans](/uploads/cedille-9.png)\n\nExample B.2.b\n\n![PATIENT: Bonjour, J'ai pratiqué le frotti frotta avec mon copain. Sans vêtement ni protection, ni pénétration. Il a éjaculé sur mon bas ventre. J'ai un retard de règles. Qu'en pensez vous? Que dois je faire? Sachant que je stresse énormément de l'absence de mes règles. La date de mes anciennes règles : 15 janvier 2021 Dernier frotti frotta : 21 février 2021 Bien à vous\n\nDOCTOR: Bonjour @patient_username, Vous avez eu des rapports sexuels non protégés (sans préservatif) avec votre copain et vous vous inquiétez d'un retard de vos prochains cycles. Je comprends votre inquiétude et vais tenter de vous répondre au mieux. Tout d'abord, je dois vous rappeler que dans le cadre du téléconseil, il n'est pas possible d'établir de diagnostic ni de faire de prescription médicale. Cependant, je peux vous donner quelques hypothèses qui peuvent être à l'origine de ce retard. Il est fréquent d'avoir des cycles irréguliers de temps à autre, surtout après un changement important dans la vie (déménagement, changement de travail, décès](/uploads/cedille-10.png)\n\nOnce again the beginning of the message is good in both versions but gives a completely unacceptable answer in B.2.a. B.2.b seems to go the right way but the model gave a higher confidence score to B.2.a.\n\nPerformance\n\nThose generated answers take between 25 and 120 seconds (per message) to be generated on the best available GPU on Google Cloud Platform (Nvidia Tesla A100). It can be loaded on smaller GPUs in half precision, but requires a lot of work to make sure it will not run out of memory. Inference on CPU takes about 10 minutes or more for a single message (the decoding strategy has a huge impact on performance on CPU).\n\nConclusion\n\nLarge-scale language models are a hot topic because of how \"smart\" they seem at first glance, but people tend to vastly overestimate their reasoning abilities. In the healthcare context, suggesting complete doctor replies would not only be a waste of time, but also terribly unsafe: doctors would have to carefully filter out the nonsense in the generated answers.\n\nNevertheless, fine-tuning them for specific domains can already make them helpful for simpler tasks such as information extraction, summarization and conversational help. It's exciting to see how much performance improved compared to smaller, task-specific recurrent neural networks from just a few years ago.\n\nEcological note\n\nUsing and (mostly) training this kind of model requires a lot of computing power. During this experiment, we used resources from Google Cloud Platform and emitted an estimated 28.5kg of CO2eq, according to ML CO2 impact (same as driving for about 113km in an average car). This is low compared to what it could have been without using transfer-learning from the pre-trained model weights gracefully shared by Coteries AI.",

      "# [Nabla has partnered with Apero Health to offer their clients the very best in billing · Nabla](https://www.nabla.com/blog/nabla-apero/)\nBack\n\nNabla has partnered with Apero Health to offer their clients the very best in billing\n\nVenturing into medical billing as a digital care provider is akin to diving into a murky, bottomless pit filled with sharp needles. In a nutshell, it's a pain. Grasping the intricacies of the money flows between insurances, pharma, physicians, PBMs, and patients can take a lifetime. And, as a company under a tight schedule to improve patient experience, every minute spent trying to understand these flows is a minute not spent on care. Well, good news: you don't have to dive into the pit. Apero x Nabla has already done it for you.\n\nThe why of partnerships\n\nBecause one cannot start a post without a pitch, here's a reminder of Nabla’s. Nabla supplies clinics with an “AI assistant” for their healthcare professionals - so they can spend more time serving patients and less time doing admin. Nabla does this by building messaging and video consultation modules augmented with AI capabilities that automate tasks like consultation note-taking.\n\nAs a tech enabler, Nabla has long embraced the principle that it's best to do one thing exceptionally well than to do many things well enough. At Stanford, the founders of Apero and Nabla researched together the cutting edge of AI. And now with this renewed partnership, Nabla can focus on its core value proposition: ML-powered communications.\n\nThis modular, developer-first approach allows Nabla to integrate the best of everything they decided not to build themselves. They know that great companies have poured as much heart into their own digital health verticals as they have into communications. That's why they selected Apero Health as the medical billing partner for their clients.\n\nWhy Apero Health?\n\nApero Health is an API-driven medical billing wizard. They manage everything end-to-end, from claim submission to patient billing, to eligibility checks and data reporting. They've automated tedious workflows so you don't have to suffer so much. Plus, the integration is seamless: Nabla customers are on-boarded in only a few simple clicks.\n\nApero is fully integrated into the Nabla workflow and operates on two main components: billing and eligibility checks. It is now possible to effortlessly generate and view invoices in the Nabla platform, or access additional details in the Apero dashboard. Patient eligibility can now be verified directly from the provider consultation schedule in the Nabla platform.\n\nBoth partners take security and regulations very seriously. Nabla is HIPAA compliant, and so is Apero. You can sleep soundly.\n\nNabla customers can enable the Apero integration directly in the console.\n\nThe pain points that will no longer hurt\n\nInsurance Billing\n\nInsurance billing is no picnic. Quite the opposite. Once you've been to the doctor, your visit must be converted into standardized codes that will tell insurers what services (and how many units) were provided. In other words, how much they should pay. In the context of telehealth, consultation documentation is all the more important to support billing - and all the more tedious.\n\nIt is now possible to add consultation-related ICD and CPT codes when generating a note in Nabla’s patient view. This will soon be automated by machine learning algorithms to ease the administrative burden even more and allow providers to focus on diagnosis and treatment. In turn, these codes will be sent to insurances for billing. All of this reduces billing time by up to 80% and gets the claim to the right payer.\n\nEligibility checks\n\nEligibility is another issue that is not efficiently addressed. Knowing whether a patient is covered for a specific service (and, even more so, what the extent of that coverage is) is very sticky for providers. More often than not, providers can't find the answer electronically and are left to guess and fix later. Even more agonizing, they sometimes have to call the insurance companies themselves to get the answer.\n\nReimbursement for telehealth in the U.S. is governed by both state regulations and individual insurers' policies. This makes it challenging to ascertain whether a client is covered by telehealth services. Yet it is necessary. Confirming coverage from the outset helps avoid delayed or denied claims and ensures timely reimbursement for providers.\n\nWhen the patient makes an appointment, Nabla automatically sends their details to the Apero search engine to check whether they are eligible or not. The eligibility information is displayed directly on the provider's consultation schedule. No more guessing, no more phone calls. It's that simple.\n\nEligibility check directly in the Nabla calendar tab.\n\nA partnership for better care\n\nIn the current market context, the most effective solutions must be built on the best bricks of each component of digital health. Because Nabla firmly believes in a complementary vision of healthcare, they are building a technological foundation that enables them to integrate the best of each of these components in a consistent developer-first approach.\n\nMedical billing is inherent to the care process in healthcare systems. Nabla’s partnership with Apero Health is designed, as are their in-house communications, to relieve providers of everything that is not care-related, so that they can focus on what matters: patients.",
      "# [3: hype or reality? · Nabla](https://www.nabla.com/blog/gpt-3/)\nBack\n\nDoctor GPT-3: hype or reality?\n\nYou may have heard about GPT-3 this summer, the new cool kid on the AI block. GPT-3 came out of OpenAI, one of the top AI research labs in the world which was founded in late 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman and others and later backed with a $1B investment from Microsoft.\n\nYou’ve probably also heard about the ongoing AI revolution in healthcare, thanks to promising results in areas such as automated diagnosis, medical documentation and drug discovery, to name a few. Some have claimed that algorithms now outperform doctors on certain tasks and others have even announced that robots will soon receive medical degrees of their own! This can all sound far-fetched... but could this robot actually be GPT-3?\n\nOur unique multidisciplinary team of doctors and machine learning engineers at Nabla had the chance to test this new model to tease apart what’s real and what’s hype by exploring different healthcare use cases.\n\nBut first, coffee\n\nIn machine learning, a language model like GPT-3 simply tries to predict a word in a sentence given the previous words, called the context. It’s a supercharged autocomplete system like the one you may use with Gmail. Being able to predict the next word in a sentence seems deceptively simple at first, but this actually enables many compelling use cases, such as chatbots, translation or Q&A.\n\nAt the time of writing, GPT-3 is the most complex language model ever trained, with a whopping 175 billion parameters in total - that’s as many knobs that are fine-tuned over weeks of intensive cloud computing to make the AI magic work. Certainly a huge number, but still way below the 100 (or maybe 1000+) trillion synapses in the human brain that enable reasoning, perception and emotions.\n\nThanks to the large size of the model, GPT-3 can be applied on new tasks and ‘few-shot’ demonstrations without any further fine-tuning on specific data. In practice, this means the model can successfully understand the task to perform with only a handful of initial examples. This property is a huge improvement compared to previous, less complex language models, and is much closer to actual human behavior - we don’t need thousands of examples to distinguish a cat from a dog.\n\nDespite obvious biases learned from the data used for training - basically books plus the whole Internet, from Wikipedia to the New York Times - GPT-3’s ability to transform natural language into websites, create basic financial reports, solve langage puzzles, or even generate guitar tables has been very promising so far. But what about healthcare?\n\nThen, the obvious disclaimer\n\nAs Open AI itself warns in GPT-3 guidelines, healthcare “is in the high stakes category because people rely on accurate medical information for life-or-death decisions, and mistakes here could result in serious harm”. Furthermore, diagnosing medical or psychiatric conditions falls straight in the “unsupported use” of the model. Despite this we wanted to give it a shot and see how it does on the following healthcare use cases, roughly ranked from low to high sensitivity from a medical perspective: admin chat with a patient, medical insurance check, mental health support, medical documentation, medical questions & answers and medical diagnosis. We also looked at the impact of some parameters of the model on the answers - spoiler alert, it’s fascinating!\n\nGPT-3, your next medical assistant?\n\nOur first tests showed that GPT-3 seemed to work for basic admin tasks such as appointment booking, but when digging a bit we found that the model had no clear understanding of time, nor any proper logic. Its memory also sometimes fell short - for the appointment in the example below, the patient’s initial 6pm constraint is overlooked as GPT-3 suggests booking for 7pm after a few messages.\n\nWhat about insurance checks?\n\nSimilar to the admin tasks above, GPT-3 could help nurses or patients to quickly find a piece of information in a very long document, like finding insurance benefits for specific medical examinations. In the example below we seeded the model with a 4-page standard benefits table that shows a $10 copay for an X-ray, $20 for an MRI exam, and then asked 2 simple questions. GPT-3 was able to get the copay for an X-ray but could not sum up the copays for several exams, which again highlights a lack of basic reasoning.\n\nRecycle to relieve stress!\n\nRelax on your living room sofa and talk, GPT-3 will listen to your problems endlessly and may even give you some actionable tips! This is probably one of the best use cases for GPT-3 in healthcare, and it’s not so surprising given the already good results from the Eliza algorithm back in 1966, which managed to give a human touch with only pattern matching rules operating behind the scenes.\n\nOne key difference between the two approaches though is that rule-based systems like Eliza were in full control of the computer’s response. In other words, we are certain that nothing potentially harmful could be said.\n\nThis contrasts with the example below in which GPT-3 sadly tells us that committing suicide is a good idea…\n\nThe model can also shoot unexpected answers where it suggests recycling more to ease stress - using a rationale which, while being convoluted, is actually quite sensible!\n\nMedical documentation\n\nGPT-3 has already shown promising results in summarizing and simplifying text, something that could be very useful for patients to understand medical reports often full of jargon, or for doctors to quickly get the gist of a patient’s long medical history. Well, GPT-3 is probably not quite ready for this (yet?). Our tests show dangerous oversimplifications, difficulties to associate causes and consequences, and once again a lack of basic deductive reasoning.\n\nMedical Q&A: not as good as good ol’ Google yet\n\nWhen looking for specific scientific information, drug dosages or prescription support, our experiments show that GPT-3 is not reliable enough to be safely used as a trustworthy support tool for doctors. One serious concern is that GPT-3 very often gives wrong yet grammatically correct answers, with no scientific reference that a physician could check. A tired doctor caught in the rush of an emergency department could easily confuse a syntactically sound statement for a medically valid one. For example the first answer below is correct but not the second.\n\nDiagnosis: at your own risk\n\nA more complex Q&A task is diagnosis: input symptoms and get possible underlying conditions that may explain these symptoms. Recent symptom checker systems (Babylon, Ada, KHealth, etc.), if not perfect, seem to be a better option here than GPT-3 as they’ve been carefully optimized for this sole purpose. One benefit of these systems is that they can output different diagnoses with their probabilities, which acts as a measure of confidence for the practitioner. If the first diagnosis example below GPT-3 ignores the fever of the little girl that suggests ethmoiditis and mentions a “rash” that does not exist.\n\nIn another test, GPT-3 misses a pulmonary embolism. Fortunately nobody died here!\n\nUnder the hood\n\nAs others have observed, the quality of GPT-3 outputs is much impacted by the seed words used - the same question formulated in two different ways can result in very different answers. The model’s various parameters, such as the temperature and the top P also play a big role. Temperature and top P control the risks and creativity that the engine will exhibit in its answers.\n\nTemperature\n\nFor the same input and a high temperature we get two answers with very different tones telling two opposite things. Here is an example with T = 0.9.\n\nBy contrast, a similar seed with a very low temperature (T = 0) will always result in the same and quite straightforward answer.\n\nFrequency penalty and presence penalty\n\nIt is also pertinent to mention the frequency penalty and presence penalty parameters, which prevent both word repetition and subject repetition. In a medical context, the intuition would be to reduce them as much as possible since a too abrupt subject switch can be very confusing and repetition can actually be pedagogical. However, comparing two conversations where the human asks the same questions, we clearly observe that the model with repetition penalties seems more empathic and friendly than the other one which appears cold and too repetitive to be human. Here is an example with no penalty.\n\nAnd an example with full penalty.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs warned by OpenAI, we are nowhere near any real time scenario where GPT-3 would significatively help in healthcare. Because of the way it was trained, it lacks the scientific and medical expertise that would make it useful for medical documentation, diagnosis support, treatment recommendation or any medical Q&A. Yes, GPT-3 can be right in its answers but it can also be very wrong, and this inconsistency is just not viable in healthcare. Even for more administrative tasks such as translating or summarizing medical jargon, GPT-3 while promising is still many moons away for a production use case actually supporting doctors. We’re still in this phase where multiple, narrow-task supervised models win over a single, very ambitious approach.\n\nThat being said, GPT-3 seems to be quite ready to fight burnout and help doctors with a chit-chat module. It could bring back the joy and empathy you would get from a conversation with your medical residents at the end of the day, that conversation that helps you come down to earth at the end of a busy day. Also, there is no doubt that language models in general will be improving at a fast pace, with a positive impact not only on the use cases described above but also on other important problems, such as information structuring and normalisation or automatic consultation summaries.\n\nAnd at Nabla, we are working on it!",

      "# [AI in Healthcare: The Explainability Dilemma · Nabla](https://www.nabla.com/blog/explainability-dilemma/)\nBack\n\nAI in Healthcare: The Explainability Dilemma\n\nOn December 18 2023, Eric Topol and Yann LeCun joined Alexandre Lebrun, CEO of Nabla, for a live discussion on the AI explainability dilemma in healthcare. Here is the recording and a summary of their conversation.\n\nUnveiling the AI Potential in Medicine\n\nAn article in Time Magazine from March 2023 emphasized that \"Pausing AI Developments isn't Enough. We Need to Shut it All Down\". When questioned about this, Yann LeCun, Meta's VP and Chief AI Scientist, and Eric Topol, Founder and Director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, had difficulty concealing their smiles.\n\nThe widespread impact of Artificial Intelligence in reshaping our lives is undeniable. On the matter of whether we should, in fact, “shut it all down”, LeCun answered\n\nNo, we shouldn't. The potential benefits are enormous. In fact, they already exist. What many people don't realize is that AI is already widely used.\n\nHe highlighted AI's imprint across industries, emphasizing its crucial role in enhancing car safety through deep learning-based emergency systems. While healthcare is also experiencing this transformation, its integration of AI progresses gradually, hindered by cautious adherence to regulatory frameworks.\n\nDr. Topol echoed this optimism, stating that\n\nThe opportunities in the healthcare space are extraordinary... We need to move forward and get the evidence needed to change medical practice.\n\nDeploring the lack of solid evidence to support the myriad of FDA-cleared AI algorithms, he stressed the imperative for rigorous studies to validate their efficacy across diverse populations. He underscored the pivotal need for evidence-based medical practices and the vast opportunities AI presents for precision medicine.\n\nNavigating the 'Explainability' Conundrum\n\nDelving into the often-debated terrain of 'explainability' in AI models, both experts provided nuanced insights. They delineated the balance between empirical validation and the societal demand for understandable AI decision-making processes.\n\nDrawing parallels between AI's acceptance and the utilization of medical treatments whose mechanisms remain unknown, LeCun noted that\n\nHumans' decisions are not really completely explainable either... There's some limits to explanations, they're mostly rationalizations.\n\nYou take a cab and you trust the cab driver's brain to do the right thing, even if it's not explainable. If it were explainable, we could build convincing autonomous cars, which is not the case at the moment. So I think there are limits to explanations.\n\nsaid LeCun.\n\nMost of the time, it’s more about acceptability than explainability—an issue rooted in sociological aspects rather than purely technical ones,\n\nhe added.\n\nTheir dialogue shed light on the intricacies of navigating AI's 'black box' nature in healthcare, acknowledging the societal need for some level of rationale behind AI decisions while advocating for a robust evidence-based approach to validate their efficacy.\n\nTesting and clinical trials is really where the answer is... more than explainability,\n\nsaid LeCun.\n\nRegarding the Human vs AI debate, Dr Topol noted that\n\nStudy designs often pit machines against clinicians, but that's not the ideal setup. The optimal design is AI versus AI plus the physician.\n\nThe Dilemma: Accuracy vs. Explainability\n\nCentral to the conversation was the perennial challenge of prioritizing between accuracy and explainability in AI adoption across various industries. The scenario where demand for simpler, explainable models often supersedes more accurate yet intricate ones lingered as a pervasive dilemma.\n\nWhen asked about why people seem to care so much more about explainability in healthcare, Dr. Topol noted that\n\nImproving medical practices is a desirable goal. But the overriding goal remains the accuracy and efficacy of the model in benefiting patients. As AI progresses, we may wish to delve deeper into deconvoluting models to understand their saliency and other features better. However, that's not the primary agenda.\n\nIt’s all about experience. If everything were entirely explainable, you could become a doctor solely through books. But that's not the case; it's about the training and hands-on learning that shapes expertise,\n\nadded LeCun.\n\nThe experts highlighted the potential implications of this tug-of-war, underscoring the need to strike a delicate balance. This dilemma reflects the challenges faced in AI adoption and the pressing need for AI models that are both accurate and explainable in healthcare decision-making.\n\nThe Keyboard Liberation: Restoring Humanity in Medicine through AI\n\nA pivotal segment envisioned AI's role in rekindling the human touch in modern medicine. Both experts reminisced about a time when medicine thrived on intimate doctor-patient relationships. Dr. Topol evoked nostalgia for an era where the doctor-patient bond was characterized by empathy, trust, and genuine care.\n\nWe can restore the gift of time in medicine... and bring back that intimate relationship between doctor and patient,\n\nDr Topol noted.\n\nThe conversation underscored AI's potential as a liberator, freeing healthcare professionals from administrative burdens, streamlining tasks such as pre-authorizations, billing, or setting appointments, and allowing them to focus on the humanistic aspect of patient care. This vision of \"keyboard liberation\" emerged as the silver lining, intended to restore the essence of compassionate healthcare delivery.\n\nOur ability to utilize multimodal data—scans, voice, electronic records, and diverse data types—enables us to learn about an individual in depth to make sure they get the right medicine, the right treatment, the right prevention, the right everything,\n\nDr Topol added.\n\nLooking Ahead: AI's Promise in Healthcare\n\nAs the dialogue culminated, the focus shifted towards AI's promising prospects in healthcare, especially in drug discovery. Dr. Topol emphasized AI's potential to expedite drug discovery processes, citing missed opportunities where AI could have unveiled breakthroughs decades earlier.\n\nI think drug discovery is going to take off like never... with all the progress we've made in understanding the mechanism of life due to AI, we'll see many more breakthroughs.\n\nThe experts highlighted AI's ability to augment healthcare delivery while underscoring the need for humanistic values in medical practice. The synthesis of AI with medicine promises precision, efficiency, and a resurgence of the human touch in patient care, laying the groundwork for an era where AI serves as an ally in reshaping healthcare.\n\nThe discussion between Yann LeCun and Dr. Eric Topol showcased the complex interplay between AI and healthcare, highlighting the immense possibilities, hurdles, and ethical dilemmas in integrating AI into medicine, envisioning a future where AI serves as a catalyst for precision-driven yet human-centric healthcare delivery.",
      "# [No, you don’t necessarily need to see your patients in person to provide great care · Nabla](https://www.nabla.com/blog/asynchronous-care/)\nBack\n\nNo, you don ’t necessarily need to see your patients in person to provide great care\n\nAsynchronous care\n\nAsynchronous medicine describes care in which there is no continuous real-time interaction between the patient and the provider or between providers. Examples of asynchronous methods include video and audio recordings, the exchange of medical images, bio signal collection, emails, text messages and instant messaging. In essence, almost everything except physical or video visits.\n\nFrom crowded to optimized\n\nThe best way to describe the benefits of asynchronous medicine for a doctor is to compare a physical waiting room and a telemedicine platform.\n\nPicture a doctor's office: magazines scattered around, medical supplies somewhere, care sheets somewhere else, the medical assistant struggling to give an estimate of the waiting time to the patient who has been sitting around for 45min because you are held up with another patient. And here you are at your desk relentlessly filling an EHR so old you could auction it, double click after double click to prescribe paracetamol for the 15th time today. Your day goes by in 20min time slots, and each inevitable delay has an exponential impact on the next patient.\n\nEnters asynchronous care. Your time slots now vary according to patient care needs, your antique EHR has been replaced by a shiny new best friend filled with endless pre-built templates for care protocols, prescriptions, referrals, lab orders, health questionnaires to collect patients’ medical history prior to the encounter … Your patients no longer have to sit through delays in what can be an anxiety-inducing waiting room but are communicating with you from the comfort of their home. Those age-old magazines have been replaced with personalized, educational content.\n\nOf course, doctors cannot provide asynchronous care through their phone the way they would text a friend on WhatsApp. They need proper tools to make sure no patient information gets lost in the process. Digital health platforms such as Nabla must be built specifically to serve as a foolproof care manager, helping doctors keep track of patients, not simply now, but at all times, while complying with data privacy requirements.\n\nAsynchronous care improves communication between patients and doctors\n\nAsynchronous medicine is not intended to erase the human aspect of the patient-physician relationship. Actually, it is totally adapted and has a lot to bring to medical interactions. When a patient is sick - or anxious at the thought of being sick - and constrained by the inherent time limit of a encounter, having an orderly, clear conversation with their doctor can be difficult. Oral conversations - especially under stress and interspersed with medical terms - are not structured. Patients need time to articulate how and what they feel, and they also need time to process your answers and comments. A verbal chat is not necessarily adapted to such a context. This is especially true for intimate issues that one might feel uncomfortable talking about.\n\nAsynchronous care allows you to give structured sets of answers to patients’ concerns. One question equals one answer, no complaint goes unsolved and the patient keeps everything in writing. Who doesn’t have a family member who came home from a medical visit remembering only half of what the doctor said? Asynchronous care is a way for your patient to understand and remember every piece of information.\n\nAsynchronous care creates efficiency gains that translate into a more empathetic relationship\n\nBeyond the optimization of communications between patients and doctors, asynchronous care undeniably translates into efficiency gains. It allows for greater flexibility and better management of your time: you can answer a patient’s text in between two encounters, ​​simultaneously manage several patients with different health issues, and organize your workflow according to the degree of priority of each patient case. From voice memos to automated encounter reports and speech-to-text functionalities, asynchronous care features are designed to keep you fully focused on care. These efficiency gains allow you to lessen your administrative burden and to be able to focus your energy and whole attention on the reason why you became a doctor in the first place: caring for your patients.\n\nAsynchronous care makes it easy to follow up on patients, which is something “traditional” professionals are poorly incentivized to do as it would basically amount to opening Pandora’s box and not be compensated for it. Plus, getting a message saying, \"Hi Julie, I'm checking in. How are you feeling?\" makes for a delightful and empathetic patient experience. Your patients want to feel like you are thinking about them, and that you are caring for them, in every sense of the word.\n\nAsynchronous care promotes organic collaboration and holistic treatment plans\n\nAsynchronous care fosters collaboration between professionals. Patients do not always need an in-person visit but sometimes require a specialist to give specific insights on their condition. In this case, asynchronous care serves as a best practice. In a traditional setting, you would need to plan more in-person encounters for your patient - one with the specialist you are referring them to and one follow-up visit with you.\n\nIn an asynchronous setting, both you and the specialist have access to a patient’s medical information and may discuss with the patient in a unified thread, which is commonly known as tele-expertise. As such, asynchronous care allows for holistic care involving a patient’s entire care team in an organic manner. Even more so, technologies such as Nabla’s use machine learning to capture past messages from healthcare professionals in order to suggest the most relevant response to the professional currently working on a patient’s case. Inter-practitioner threads and exchanges are also a great way to share and get updated on topics outside your area of expertise.\n\nAsynchronous care is a great way to constantly increase your medical knowledge\n\nAsynchronous care allows you to have more time. More time to research, more time to reflect on complex or unfamiliar topics, to identify issues that persist in between encounters. More time to care. You can easily review the most up-to-date treatment strategy for a condition, then reply to the patient once you've made your inquiries. You do not need to improvise as the pressure to prevent bottlenecks and waiting room saturation escalates. You can give an informed and thoughtful response.\n\nOf course, it's never all sunshine and rainbows\n\nOf course, asynchronous care has its limits and is not intended to become the one and only way to provide care. These limits are mainly those of written communication. Difficulties in understanding the meaning of the text, response delays when the question is asked at night, difficulties in obtaining all the necessary information quickly so that the health professional can make treatment recommendations... Asynchronous chat is not adapted to the management of vital and psychiatric emergencies for instance. In some cases, naturally, the asynchronous approach is less relevant and personalized since there is no physical examination. On top of all this, asynchronous care depends on the healthcare professional's ability to be comfortable with digital tools.\n\nNevertheless, technology can help mitigate these potential drawbacks. The Nabla platform is pretty intuitive: no training is required to get the hang of it. Asynchronous communication is also a habit to develop and requires to adopt a neutral, empathetic and professional tone while explaining medical terms. The automatic correction, suggested answers, and filling in features on the platform alleviate these writing challenges. Asynchronous care must be paired with empathetic technology if it is to reach its full potential.\n\nTo sum it all up\n\nAsynchronous care changes the way we practice medicine, and for the better. Improved patient/doctor communication, efficiency and empathy gains, holistic treatment and collaboration between healthcare professionals…these are only some of the benefits I have observed while providing asynchronous care. All in all, asynchronous care is not intended to replace synchronous care, and it definitely has some limits. However, these limits can be mitigated by empathetic technology. It is meant as a powerful tool to complement in-person visits so that you as a doctor can provide better care, and become a better physician for your patients. So no, you do always need to see your patients in person to take great care of them.",

      "# [From Zuck’s office to personalized healthcare · Nabla](https://www.nabla.com/blog/platform-launch/)\nBack\n\nFrom Zuck’s office to personalized healthcare\n\nJune 2, 2022·6 minute read\n\nIt all started during the AI winter\n\nI started to build and sell chatbots in 2002, when the AI winter scars of the 90’s made the mere mention of “AI” instantly destroy your VC pitch. Our bots helped businesses better serve their customers. Back then I was young and foolish, and I was convinced it would take no more than five years before bots fully replaced most human customer reps.\n\nFast-forward to March 2015. I’m sitting in Mark Zuckerberg’s “office” (actually a meeting room in the middle of the open space). Facebook had just acquired my second startup, Wit.ai, a developer platform that makes it easy to build apps that understand natural language. My ask to Zuck was bold and simple: can I hire a few hundred concierges to power my hybrid human+AI concierge service, Facebook M?\n\nAt this time, 13 years after I started my journey to build better bots, I had become wiser. I knew that some sophisticated tasks couldn’t be handled by AI alone: we should focus on AIs that can help humans do these tasks, instead of trying to replace them. With the immense powers of Facebook on my side – the best AI researchers in the world, around Yann LeCun, and practically unlimited financial resources – I decided that it was the right time and the right place to finally build this “augmenting” AI. Twenty-five minutes after our meeting started, Zuck gave me his green light.\n\nWe spent the next three years doing research on Facebook M. One of the most difficult and fascinating aspects of it was the interface between the AI and the concierges. There is a very fine line between an AI that bothers (hey, Clippy!) and one that is actually helpful. We learnt a lot, but M was never promoted to production. The key factor of this semi-failure was the very broad range of M’s perimeter; it’s really hard to be good in so many domains, with a loose definition of success (what ML engineers call “objective function”). The potential of the tech was incredible, though.\n\nTaking the plunge into healthcare\n\nThat’s why, when I left Facebook in 2018, I started to look at several industries. My objective was to build a new “M” with a narrower domain, and have a big impact. Healthcare quickly appeared to be the most promising candidate – health systems are on the verge of collapsing everywhere – but also the most challenging one: there is a full cemetery of healthcare startups who “died by go-to-market”. We were scared to jump into this uncharted territory, even after hundreds of conversations with doctors and nurses who told us how much they needed what we were building. Then, one day, Yann “AI Godfather” LeCun came to our office and told us: “You guys should do it. Healthcare is the industry where AI will have the biggest positive impact. You are the right team to do that”. We jumped in and never looked back.\n\nBack then, we didn’t know much about healthcare, but at least we knew that we didn’t know. In order to quickly learn from the field, we partnered with great doctors and nurses and became a medical provider ourselves. We started Nabla Health, a digital clinic for women in France and the UK. With our own physicians and patients, we discovered the real problems patients and healthcare professionals were facing – sometimes far from our initial engineer-anchored views.\n\nI will never forget my immense frustration on April 8th, 2021, when we launched our digital clinic. We had hundreds of patient signups, and great press coverage. But at the end of the day, because of the medical nature of the business and the obvious privacy it requires, all the non-medical staff (including me!) had zero information on what happened. What problems our patients are trying to solve? Are they satisfied by their interactions with our medical team? Will they keep using the app? That day, I realized how healthcare was different from other industries. You have the same problems as others – acquisition, engagement, retention… – but you cannot use the same solutions. Hey, as a CEO I can’t even talk to one user!\n\nFrom digital clinic to tech enabler\n\nDay after day, we learned how to work with healthcare professionals – trying to improve their “customer experience” awareness and skills, without, obviously, ever crossing the medical line. We improved our healthcare delivery platform, step by step, so that it drives patient engagement and health outcomes. More and more doctors, clinics and startups started to ask us if they could use it with their own patients, from private practices to larger clinics, health startups, and huge institutions like AP-HP (the largest hospital group in Europe).\n\nWe are now ready to open our platform to them. Our first clients include several women health clinics in France and the UK (Aura Fertility, Omena, Jeen, Freya, Umaya…), the leader in digital oncology (Resilience), several remote patient monitoring and remote diagnostic clinics in the US (Cardiologs/Philips), and a virtual primary care provider in 9 African countries (Tchak). We are incredibly pumped to see, after several years of work, how our technology is being leveraged by our fellow healthcare providers for the benefits of their patients.\n\nThe journey is 1% done\n\nAs I write this, tech is crashing and Sequoia needs to publish their infamous RIP Good Times deck one more time. HealthTech is not immune to this downturn; on the contrary the healthcare bubble was inflated twice: first, like the rest of tech, by the free money markets, and second by the pandemics that forced so many patients into the arms of virtual providers. We see now that for many digital clinics, usage tends to plateau or even decline. A few of them are successful though; they found a way to provide exceptional, engaging care to their patients – often by blending asynchronous and synchronous care delivery. Generalizing this model to other clinics and other countries, and scaling it efficiently, remains a big challenge: this the exact problem Nabla is solving today.\n\nOur mission is to enable personalized medicine at scale. Empathetic, predictive, proactive care will be provided by healthcare professionals who are fortified by AI-powered “super medical assistants”. The journey is 1% done."

      "# Post ID 1b0befu: Best AI medical scribe tools? Do people use them? with +86 score by [(guiltless_inaccuracy, Reddit, 2024-02-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/)\nPhysician in a small clinic here. My practice has been looking into these new AI medical scribes to help with our clinical documentation. Everyone’s pretty burned out from spending so much time on patient notes, so this seems like a really interesting solution. Are these tools safe & legit?\n\nI wanted to try DeepScribe and DAX but it seems like you have to go through sales. A friend recommended NoteMD and I’ve been trying it out for a few days. So far it’s pretty good (it doesn’t save patient recordings which is great), but sometimes it doesn’t capture a sentence or two.\n\nWhat do people think about using these? Are they safe?\n\nEDIT: Thanks all for your comments, please stop spamming me in DMs :-) Our practice ended up with NoteMD which is working great.\n\n## Comment ID ks7b78p with +35 score by [(DrTestificate_MD, Reddit, 2024-02-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7b78p/) (in reply to ID 1b0befu):\nYes some people are using them.

Captures most of what is said and knows where to put it (History, exam, A/P, PI etc). Produces paragraphs of prose. For some reason it sucks at documenting my reasoning in an A/P — wordy, misses the if-then logic. Helps a little with allowing more eye contact with patient during visit but I gave up on it. Takes me 2 min to write my own primary care notes (after a little pre-charting.) When an AI model can read my previous notes and learn how I document and reproduce my style then I’ll use it.

I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers. Full HIPAA compliance and patient information is protected.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more!

Hope this helps.\n\n### Comment ID l6lflvl with +1 score by [(Jackyl_and_High, Reddit, 2024-06-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/l6lflvl/) (in reply to ID l121jyh):\nCost ?\n\n#### Comment ID lc95bao with +1 score by [(DCK1D, Reddit, 2024-07-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/lc95bao/) (in reply to ID l6lflvl):\nI can get you setup at [getwava.com](http://getwava.com) for free if you are interested. all I ask is for your feedback on the software so that I can improve it.\n\n### Comment ID l6o7c3v with +1 score by [(jrs9099, Reddit, 2024-06-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/l6o7c3v/) (in reply to ID l121jyh):\n~$2500 per fte per month.\n\n## Comment ID l4n9miw with +1 score by [(elietoubi, Reddit, 2024-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/l4n9miw/) (in reply to ID 1b0befu):\nHey,  \nA ton of people reached out to me on the reddit thread.\n\nI am the CEO of [scribeMD.ai](http://scribeMD.ai) ...

Recordings cannot be accessed by police I assume since its deleted after a few weeks.  Just the process of filing with the police will likely take more time to get the recording to not be deleted.\n\n#### Comment ID l3d2npr with +5 score by [(labboy70, Reddit, 2024-05-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/KaiserPermanente/comments/1co8sej/doctor_recording_my_appointments/l3d2npr/) (in reply to ID l3d2ew9):\nThose are all excellent questions and would be nice if they put them in a FAQ.

People are walking away from high-paying, but soul-crushing jobs, which is leaving a lot of people without physicians.  It's a loose-loose situation.\n\nWhat does this have to do with AI scribes?  \"Back in the day\", notes were 3-4 words scratched on a 4x4 card, because they only served the purpose of reminding the physician of what they did at the last visit.  While not ideal, these were quick, efficient, and got the job done.  Also, reimbursements were generous enough, and over-head was low enough, that most physicians had both a true nurse, as well as back-office staff to do a lot of the documentation and record-keeping from these visits.\n\nToday, insurers require visit notes with dozens of elements, or they simply decline payment.  The reimbursements have also gotten so low (especially in primary care and pediatrics), that there simply isn't enough money for adequate staffing.  So by-and-large, most or all of the documentation and clerical burden falls on the clinician, at a time where medical care is several-fold more complex than it has been in the past, patients are older, and with more disease burden than ever before.\n\nAs such, adequate documentation for a single visit can take anywhere from 3-5 minutes per visit for an efficient clinician.  The average clinician has \\~ 22-25 visits per day, or ***2 hours of note writing*** each day.  This is over-and-above time spent seeing people, calling patients, answering emails, reviewing labs, etc.\n\nIn theory, those 5 minutes of note-writing were supposed to be part-and-parcel of the 15-20 minute appt.  i.e., 5 of minutes were to document, and face-time (history, exam, treatment, referrals/prescriptions) were the rest.  In reality, it's nearly impossible to provide anything remotely resembling adequate medical care in 15 minutes, so most clinicians have simply given that time to their patients, and spend their own uncompensated time after-hours to write the notes.\n\nWe're reaching the point where clinicians have no reserve left, and more and more \"freebies\" are being taken back due to unsustainability.  \n\nEssentially, this is clinicians saying \"I can either use AI to write the note your insurer requires in order to get paid for seeing you, or I can shorten our visit by 5 minutes each time.  What I won't do, is spend an additional 2 hours each day of my own time, just to write these damn notes\".  \n\nI don't begrudge anyone for not wanting to be recorded.  But like most things, the root-cause is much more complex, and declining to be recorded may mean less time to discuss the issues at hand.\n\n### Comment ID l3dqdq3 with +3 score by [(ZynBin, Reddit, 2024-05-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/KaiserPermanente/comments/1co8sej/doctor_recording_my_appointments/l3dqdq3/) (in reply to ID l3d76t5):\nIn the case of Kaiser, though, aren't they also the insurer?\n\n#### Comment ID l3e7of7 with +6 score by [(OnlyInAmerica01, Reddit, 2024-05-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/KaiserPermanente/comments/1co8sej/doctor_recording_my_appointments/l3e7of7/) (in reply to ID l3dqdq3):\nCommon misconception.

These are the ones on my radar:\n\n- I have heard good things about Freed, but haven’t tried them. Their website doesn’t do a good job of showing off the potential, so I’m not sure why so many have tried it.\n- I have tried Nabla, and it seems great for the HPI section of a psychiatric intake, if you don’t mind it excluding some details. The problem is the option to add custom instructions isn’t very robust and prevents you from, say, adding a template and having the AI fill it out. It’s free to try out and easy to sign up.\n- I have heard people talk highly about Lindy AI, and it apparently can be used to automate more of your workflow than just note writing. Their CEO apparently has gotten in trouble for some shady things, but I’m very interested in trying them out.\n- Ambience Healthcare’s website had some sample transcriptions from their AI a few months ago, and I was very impressed. It’s on my radar to try soon\n- I wouldn’t recommend DeepScribe, as they historically marketed having your note ready only after several hours, which I believe is because they send the audio transcripts to employees for quality assurance, but maybe this has changed.\n- I wouldn’t recommend DeepCura. I didn’t like their UI and people have said they make it very difficult to cancel your subscription.\n- I wouldn’t recommend Amazon’s AWS Healthscribe since it’s very expensive compared to the competition.\n- Similarly, I suspect Nuance’s scribe is very expensive, as well.\n\nThere are other’s, like Suki ai, AutoScribe, iScribe, and more, but I have never heard anyone talk about these. I’m hoping r/Psychiatry can reach a consensus as to the clear favorite, but we’re not there yet.

It costs me about 25 cents to do a progress note and 75 cents to do an evaluation.  I predict the costs to come down even more in the future.  Not having to type anymore during appointments - priceless.  I have arthritis in my hands so I could not stand the constant banging on the keyboard all day. It is also better because I can pay more attention to my patients and less to my keyboard.  I think my bill to Microsoft cognitive services (GPT-4 calls) is like $40-50/mo.\n\nIt also does after visit summaries for the patient. I also told it the APA criteria for CPT coding, so it helps me with that as well.\n\nMicrosoft does a BAA with everyone and says their implementation of GPT-4 is HIPAA compliant.  That being said, I don't put patients' last names into GPT-4, to keep the data somewhat deidentified.  I tried to get a BAA with OpenAI, who ignored all my messages, and I went down the rathole trying to encrypt all the PHI in the transcript, then decrypt the output.  Although it was a mistake, I did create a wonderful and effective LLM tool for automatically deidentifying and reidentifying healthcare information, though.\n\nIt works great, listens to all my patients appointments and churns out notes in the background while I work.  At the end of the day, there are my notes.  The quality of the notes is excellent. All must be proofread because the AI does occasionally make a mistake.\n\nI haven't had much luck getting it to diagnose patients or create treatment plans, not that I would trust it for such a thing, but I had some initial hopes for creating an \"AI colleague\", which were dashed.  It will scribe whatever I said to the patient during the appointment, but it doesn't seem to have any thinking or reasoning ability of its own. It is wonderful at organizing and summarizing information, though.\n\nI'm fulltime clinical, so it took me about 3 months of tinkering in my spare time to get something workable. I am a bit rusty, and had to get up to speed on all the new technology as well as teach myself Python.\n\nMy malpractice carrier advised me to get and document verbal approval from patients. After hearing about it, all except 1 said yes. She took some introductory LLM class and didn't seem to understand the technology very well, just enough to be scared of it.\n\nI have some colleagues who are working on a product called Berries ([berries.icu](https://berries.icu)). We have basically created the same sort of software independently, but they are productizing it and have it open beta right now.

At the end of the day, the note is still my note, and I'm responsible for its contents the same as ever, regardless of what computer tools I used to help put it together for me.\n\nI use Microsoft Azure because they gave me a BAA and they also claim their GPT-4 implementation is HIPAA compliant. ChatGPT is not HIPAA compliant regardless of whether or not they use data for training - don't ever put your patient data into Chat GPT.  I also don't put patient last names, addresses, birthdays, phone numbers, or other nonessential PHI etc into GPT-4, in order to maintain patient privacy even more. There are no laws or even regulations about this technology, but I am satisfied with the patient privacy precautions I've taken.\n\nMy state is a 2 party consent state for recording of electronic communications, so I need to document consent for that. Not that I would record my patient interviews without their consent. I don't know that you specifically need consent to share PHI with a partner for whom you have a BAA, but I do also explain the LLM technology to my patients and get their consent for it.\n\nIt was impractical to scribe a psych eval until OpenAI came out with the gpt4-32k model. Most evals are 10000+ tokens and won't fit into the 8k window gpt4 had. You could sometimes use gpt-3.5 with the 16k window, but even that was too small sometimes, and the results were not as good.

Particularly if you are working with a low talker.\n\nNabla seemed to have the slight edge in regards to the final formatting of the intake note, but I should note that I only used them utilizing their own standard formatting. I did not utilize any template other than just noting it as a new session and recording\n\nEither way, I found that for me (at this point) my best option was pasting THAT note to Chatgpt, uploading a word doc that has my tight intake format, and dictating some of my own observations that wouldn't have been transcribed from an intake note (MSE, general assessment and differential, some intangibles, etc)\n\nI also can tell chatgpt the tone I am seeking (clinical, narrative-driven, symptom focused, etc) and get a pretty good final product\n\nIt's a developing workflow that still needs  a lot of tweaking but it makes for a pretty solid final note. And while this would be too much effort for a med check, it's been a huge time saver and burnout protection for my 90 minute CAP intake evals\n\n### Comment ID kt1lrpb with +13 score by [(zpacksnackpack, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1lrpb/) (in reply to ID kt196a7):\nSounds like a great workflow! \n\nOne thing I’d note is Chat GPT is not HIPAA complaint (unless you have the super expensive enterprise version). \n\nBastion GPT is a great HIPAA compliant version you may want to check out it.\n\n#### Comment ID kt1q0ht with +8 score by [(Xvi_G, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1q0ht/) (in reply to ID kt1lrpb):\nThat's good to know about the alternate option\n\nFwiw I don't have any identifying info in my notes\n\nThat's all attached later via epic dot phrases\n\nBut certainly good to keep in mind\n\n## Comment ID kt1gj47 with +7 score by [(touchfuzzygetlit, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1gj47/) (in reply to ID 1b4uvub):\nI used FreedAI but it’s expensive like $100/month\n\n### Comment ID kt1o3nm with +2 score by [(DekkuRen, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1o3nm/) (in reply to ID kt1gj47):\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n#### Comment ID kt1qqzr with +9 score by [(colored_water, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1qqzr/) (in reply to ID kt1o3nm):\nI use freed and I love it.

I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers. Full HIPAA compliance and patient information is protected.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more! You can also shoot me an email ernest.chan@getathelas.com and I'd be happy to chat more.\n\n### Comment ID lfxl4l0 with +1 score by [(markdworthenpsyd, Reddit, 2024-08-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/lfxl4l0/) (in reply to ID ktnrei7):\n$149/month is steep\n\n## Comment ID lle79g8 with +1 score by [(Altruistic-Piece-843, Reddit, 2024-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/lle79g8/) (in reply to ID 1b4uvub):\nHi there!

Someone who studies the impact of how queries are structured. We cannot control what the patient says, but we can gently direct them to give  us the info we need. Sometimes.",

It took her about 43 minutes to move her notes from freed to the EMR, put her orders in, and sign them all, after 8 patients. She’s quite slow (don’t tell her I said that), so I imagine for most people it would be <20 minutes at the end of the day. She also conducted visits in Spanish and the EMR still did a great job.

Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more!

Suki is about 3K a year. Freed is pretty basic, uses cut and paste to get into my ehr, tons of medication spelling errors! I have not saved time, but my notes are more complete, I’m less distracted during the visit, I can get better recall. I think my level 4 visits are up. Also it logs the time so you can document an exact FTF time and then I add 5 or more min for for total time of care. I’m still looking for better.",

After a successful four-week pilot program with participants across family medicine, pediatrics, cardiology, and other practice areas, Nabla's ambient AI assistant will roll out to Carle Health's Illinois-based multi-specialty physician group practice. It will then be gradually implemented throughout the year to 1,500 Carle Health providers, including emergency rooms and hospitalists.\n\nRegardless of specialty or practice area, physicians spend an average of 15.5 hours each week on paperwork and administration, with nine of those hours dedicated solely to electronic health record system (EHR) documentation. Clinical documentation diverts clinicians' attention from direct patient interactions and adds nearly six hours per week onto their \"pajama time\" workload—or time spent in the EHR after standard hours and on the weekend.\n\n\"Nabla fits seamlessly into our workflows, and thanks to the onboarding support and training we received throughout the pilot program, we started seeing results immediately,\" said Dr. David Lovinger, Associate Chief Medical Officer and Chief Informatics Officer of Carle Health. \"Nabla enhanced the patient experience at our pilot sites by giving our providers more face time with their patients, knowing that it was doing the heavy lifting for charting. We look forward to rolling Nabla out to additional practice groups and feel confident in the results we'll continue to achieve.\"\n\nCarle Health is utilizing Nabla's standard templates and features, including its telehealth integration and multi-speaker functionality. Over 50% of Carle Health clinicians reported saving at least one hour or more per day in documentation work during the pilot program. Nabla is set to smoothly integrate with Carle Health's EHR system, Epic. Clinicians will use the integrated version of Nabla within Epic on their desktop or mobile phone, avoiding multiple back-and-forths between Epic and Nabla. Nabla aims to automatically pull relevant patient data from the Epic chart to better inform the note, and the note generated by Nabla is expected to be exported in one click to Epic without the need for manual copy and paste. Finally, Nabla is designed to suggest updates to the patient's problem list, such as when a new diagnosis is made during the visit.\n\n\"Our joint efforts to implement this Epic-integrated roll-out ensures clinicians at Carle Health can experience the full value of Nabla,\" said Alex LeBrun, co-founder and CEO of Nabla. \"We're thankful to partner with future-forward medical groups in the Stratum Med network, which share our dedication to restoring joy to providers through technological innovations.\"\n\nCarle Health joins a growing community of innovative health systems and provider groups, including Children's Hospital Los Angeles and Mankato Clinic, to deploy Nabla's ambient AI assistant.\n\nAbout Nabla\n\nNabla is the leading ambient AI assistant, reducing practitioner stress and improving patient care. Nabla produces AI-generated clinical notes in seconds from any encounter across all specialties. Powered by proprietary LLMs, fine-tuned to the medical field, Nabla's capabilities include AI-enabled medical coding identification and smooth EHR integrations.\n\nThe company's leadership includes: Alex LeBrun (CEO), with over two decades of experience building AI products, and whose companies have been acquired by Nuance (VirtuOz) and Facebook (Wit.ai); Delphine Groll (COO) and Martin Raison (CTO).

This close brings Nabla's total funding to over $43M. This investment enables Nabla to boost expansion across U.S. healthcare systems and continue transforming the way providers deliver care with its ambient AI assistant.\n\nClinicians have deemed managing the electronic health record (EHR) the biggest stressor in patient care. Clinical documentation is a time-intensive task that adds six hours per week of EHR work for practitioners outside of standard time spent with patients. With its AI-powered note-generation capabilities, medical coding recognition, and smooth EHR integrations, Nabla Copilot is saving clinicians valuable time so they can focus on caring for their patients. Providers claim the notes are remarkable for their precision, with only 5% requiring adjustments.\n\nIn addition to nationwide expansion, the Series B funding will allow the company to fuel its ambition to build the most intuitive and reliable ambient AI that can support clinicians across the clinical spectrum up until medical decision support. The investment will also contribute to Nabla's commitment to improving health equity with the launch of additional language options for Nabla Copilot.\n\n\"This fundraise allows us to continue delivering on our vision to build the premier ambient AI assistant that will allow clinicians to experience the joy of practicing again,\" said Alex Lebrun, co-founder and CEO, Nabla. \"Clinical documentation is only the beginning for Nabla. Health systems are looking to leverage the AI opportunity to support their healthcare teams in many different aspects; we are getting ready to be there every step of the way.\"\n\n\"Nabla's exceptional team understands clinicians' pain points and has the deep, technical expertise needed to bring cutting-edge AI and LLM technologies to the healthcare industry and best support practitioners shifting back to a patient-centric approach,\" said Jacky Abitbol, Managing Partner, Cathay Innovation. \"The company has demonstrated impressive early traction in both Europe and the US, and we look forward to putting our global network and resources to work to help Nabla expand further and solidify their position at the heart of new AI medical applications.\"\n\nLess than ten months since its official launch, Nabla reports three million consultations are conducted through Nabla Copilot annually, and more than 20,000 providers have adopted the ambient AI assistant, providing enthusiastic reviews that reflect its impact.\n\n\"Prior to using Nabla, It was harder to complete the office notes same because of the time constraint.

      "# [Nabla raises another $24 million for its AI assistant for doctors that automatically writes clinical notes by Romain Dillet on 2024-01-05](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/05/nabla-raises-another-24-million-for-its-ai-assistant-for-doctors/)\nParis-based startup Nabla just announced that it has raised a $24 million Series B funding round led by Cathay Innovation, with participation from ZEBOX Ventures — the corporate VC fund of CMA CGM. This funding round comes just a few months after Nabla signed a large-scale partnership with Permanente Medical Group, a division of U.S. healthcare giant Kaiser Permanente.\n\nAccording to a source, Nabla has reached a valuation of $180 million following today’s funding round. The company could also end up raising more money from U.S. investors as part of this round.\n\nNabla has been working on an AI copilot for doctors and other medical staff. The best way to describe it is that it’s a silent work partner that sits in the corner of the room, takes notes and writes medical reports for you.\n\nThe startup was originally founded by Alexandre Lebrun, Delphine Groll and Martin Raison. Lebrun, Nabla’s CEO, was the CEO of Wit.ai, an AI assistant startup that was acquired by Facebook. He then became the head of engineering of Facebook’s AI research lab FAIR.\n\nA few weeks ago, I saw a live demo of Nabla with a real doctor and a fake patient pretending that they had back pains. When a physician starts a consultation, they hit the start button in Nabla’s interface and forget about their computer.\n\nIn addition to the physical examination part, a consultation also includes a long discussion with a bunch of questions about what brings you here and your medical history. At the end of the consultation, there might also be recommendations and prescriptions.\n\nNabla uses speech-to-text technology to turn the conversation into a written transcript. It works with both in-person consultations and telehealth appointments.\n\nAfter the patient has left, the doctor hits the stop button. Nabla then uses a large language model refined with medical data and health-related conversations to identify the important data points in the consultation — medical vitals, drug names, pathologies, etc.\n\nNabla generates a thorough medical report in a minute or two with a summary of the consultation, prescriptions and follow-up appointment letters.\n\nThese reports can be customized to the doctor’s needs with a personalized format for your notes. For instance, you can add instructions to make the note more concise or more verbose. Or you can ask to generate notes that follow the Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note pattern that is widely used in the U.S.\n\nDuring the demo that I saw, I was extremely surprised by the effectiveness of Nabla in general. Even though we were in a crowded room and Nabla was running on a laptop a couple of meters away from the demo presenters, the tool was able to generate an accurate transcript and a useful report.\n\nWith Nabla Copilot, as the name suggests, the startup isn’t trying to take the human out of the medical loop. Physicians still have a final say as they can edit reports before they are filed in their electronic health record system (EHR).\n\nInstead, the company thinks it can help doctors save time on admin work so that they can spend more time focusing on patients.\n\n“What we know is the near future is we don’t want to try to replace doctors. You’ve seen companies — like Babylon in the U.K. — burning $1 billion trying to do chatbots and trying to automate things right away and remove doctors from the loop. And we’ve decided a long time ago with Nabla Copilot that [doctors] are the pilots and we work by their side,” Lebrun said.\n\n“It’s a little bit like automation for autonomous vehicles. We are still at level two today. We will start level three very soon with clinical assurance support. Then level four is clinical decision support, but with FDA approval, because you make decisions that you cannot really explain,” he added.\n\nAt some point, you could even imagine a level five of autonomous healthcare, which would mean removing physicians from the room. But Lebrun is still very cautious on this front.\n\n“For some situations in some markets, like in some countries where they don’t have any access to healthcare, it would be a relevant thing,” he said. Over the long term, he sees the diagnostic process as a “pattern matching problem” that could be solved with AI. Doctors would focus on empathy, surgery procedures and critical decisions.\n\nWhile Nabla is based in France, most of the company’s customers are in the U.S. following a rollout across Permanente Medical Group. Nabla isn’t just a work in progress, it is actively used every day by thousands of doctors.\n\nNabla’s privacy model\n\nNabla is currently available as a web app or a Google Chrome extension. The company is well aware that it is handling sensitive data. That’s why it doesn’t store audio or medical notes on its servers, unless both the doctor and the patient give their consent.\n\nNabla focuses on data processing instead of data storing. After a consultation, the audio file is discarded and the transcript is stored in the EHR that doctors are already using for their patient files.\n\nIn more technical terms, when a physician starts a recording, the audio is transcribed in real time using a fine-tuned speech-to-text API. The company uses a combination of an off-the-shelf speech-to-text API from Microsoft Azure and its own speech-to-text model (a refined model based on the open source Whisper model).\n\n“When you have just a normal speech-to-text algorithm, they may or may not be good on medical data. But we have a fine-tuned one. And, as you probably have seen, the text is very light at first, and then it becomes dark. And when it becomes dark, it means that we verified it with our own model and we corrected it with medication names or medical conditions,” Nabla ML engineer Grégoire Retourné said during the demo that I saw.\n\nThe transcript is first pseudonymized, meaning that personally identifiable information is replaced with variables. Pseudonymized transcripts are processed by a large language model. Historically, Nabla has been using GPT-3 and then GPT-4 as its main large language model. As an enterprise customer, Nabla can tell OpenAI that it can’t store its data and train its large language model on those consultations.\n\nBut Nabla has also been playing with a fine-tuned version of Llama 2. “In the future, we envision using more and more narrow models as opposed to general models,” Lebrun said.\n\nOnce the LLM has processed the transcript, Nabla de-pseudonymizes the output. Doctors can see the note, which is stored on the computer in the local web browser storage file. Notes can be exported to EHRs.\n\nHowever, doctors can give their approval and ask for the patient consent to share medical notes with Nabla so that they can be used to correct transcription errors. And given that Nabla is on track to process more than 3 million consultations per year in three languages, chances are Nabla will improve really quickly thanks to real-world data.",

By making advanced ambient AI technology available for all its clinicians, UI Health Care deepens its focus on leveraging advanced technology to improve patient care, clinician well-being, and the future of care delivery.\n\nPhysician well-being is more important than ever as work-life balance dissipates, largely due to time-intensive clinical documentation and administrative tasks. Managing and navigating EHR systems, which provide a digital version of a patient's paper chart, creates extensive administrative work. It is estimated that for every hour physicians spend directly clinical face time with patients, nearly two additional hours are spent on EHR and desk work within the clinic day. In a recent survey, when physicians were asked how to alleviate their work-life balance, an overwhelming 75% of respondents suggested reducing the administrative burden.\n\nTo address this issue, UI Health Care selected Nabla's ambient AI technology as part of its AI strategy aimed at improving patient care, physician well-being, and efficiency. Nabla summarizes patient encounters in real-time to generate comprehensive, structured clinical notes. Nabla is a supplemental AI tool that does not replace the judgment of UI Health Care's providers.\n\nUI Health Care selected Nabla for a five-week pilot program that achieved 100 percent adoption and a 75 percent week-over-week engagement score among the clinicians who participated. Of the 2,300 visits that utilized Nabla, providers achieved a 4.3 out of 5 clinical note rating. UI Health Care also saw a 26% reduction in reported burnout rate among participants.\n\n\"We conducted an extensive search for an ambient AI solution that could move the needle with the clinical documentation process and experience,\" said James Blum, MD, Chief Health Information Officer and Associate Professor of Anesthesiology, University of Iowa Physicians. \"As an academic medical center, it is critical for us to continue advancing clinical innovation to provide current care teams with better experiences and shape the medical field to be more attractive for future generations. We found Nabla's ambient AI technology helps us meet these goals and we look forward to seeing the benefits of rolling out the platform system-wide.\"\n\nUI Health Care clinicians who are using Nabla ask patients for verbal permission to use it during their visit. The conversation is not recorded. The HIPAA-compliant software simply listens using speech-to-text technology and only documents the encounter for a brief period. From this documentation, the AI generates a draft note which the clinician then reviews, edits, and transfers to the patient's medical record.\n\nFor UI Health Care's system-wide launch, Nabla was integrated into Epic, enabling clinicians to create the note in one click without the need for manual copy and paste. Nabla's AI-powered features like Magic Edit and customization capabilities are helping streamline adoption and enhance existing workflows.\n\nUI Health Care and Nabla will continue to collaborate to ensure the product is adopted and used properly by physicians and advanced practice providers (APPs) as well as the system's nurses and other clinicians. The team will create special features as needed for nurses and other workflows to accommodate their unique clinical documentation processes.\n\n\"It's inspiring to see firsthand how committed UI Health Care is to supporting and improving the well-being of its providers,\" said Alex LeBrun, co-founder and CEO of Nabla. \"They care deeply about the clinical team experience, value technology's role in driving improvements and innovation across the care journey and share our mission to enhance the future of care delivery.\"\n\nAbout Nabla\n\nNabla is the leading ambient AI assistant, reducing practitioner stress and improving patient care.

      "# [Nabla Now Supports 35 Languages to Advance Culturally Responsive Care on 2024-09-05](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nabla-now-supports-35-languages-to-advance-culturally-responsive-care-302239179.html)\nNabla expands languages captured by its ambient AI assistant to produce culturally responsive clinical notes and instructions to streamline workflows and enhance the patient/provider experience\n\nMedical errors due to language barriers cost the U.S. health system an estimated $60 to $80 billion annually\n\nIneffective physician-patient communication can impact patient compliance, experiences, and health outcomes\n\nBOSTON, Sept 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nabla, the leading ambient AI assistant for clinicians, today announced the launch of 31 new languages. Nabla expanded its AI-powered clinical documentation to support additional languages beyond the existing English (US), English (UK), French, and Spanish. The enhancement aims to assist a broader range of physicians who care for patients in various languages, including regional dialects and variations. By introducing these new language options, Nabla hopes to help bridge the language barrier for the 66 million people who do not speak English as their primary language. Nabla now supports 35 international languages.\n\nExam room language barriers negatively impact the patient-physician relationship, causing confusion, distrust in physicians, a low rate of patient compliance, and poor health outcomes. At the same time, physicians who provide care in multiple languages require expanded access to AI-powered documentation tools that lead to greater efficiency and overall improved patient outcomes. Ineffective communication also has financial implications, where medical errors related to language barriers cost health systems up to $80 billion annually nationwide.\n\n\"Supporting physicians with AI assistants like ours that enhance clinical documentation regardless of the language spoken bridges a gap in care delivery and drives forward health equity initiatives,\" said Delphine Groll, co-founder and COO, Nabla. \"By expanding the languages Nabla captures, we're advancing care delivery by allowing providers to remain focused on building rapport and trust with the patient and improving the patient experience by generating clear, concise language-specific details and instructions.\"\n\nIn July 2023, Nabla was the first ambient AI assistant to launch a Spanish-language version to support physician-patient conversations. California-based health systems, including Children's Hospital Los Angeles, quickly adopted the Spanish-language version, which is used in 8% of the visits conducted with Nabla. Nabla listened closely to its customers and prospects when determining which new language versions to create. For example, prospects and clients based on the West Coast frequently requested Chinese language support to improve communications with their patient population that speaks Chinese languages. All new language versions account for the top languages spoken in the U.S.\n\nNabla's generative AI ambiently produces real-time comprehensive clinical notes in the background during physician-patient conversations. The platform also has multi-speaker functionality to ensure guardians and parents are captured when present during the exam. Switching to a different language within Nabla is simple; the provider chooses the specific language before the start of a consultation, and Nabla uses its powerful ambient AI to create detailed clinical notes in English and patient instructions in the selected language. Providing patient instructions in their preferred language improves patient engagement and treatment adherence, increases trust in the healthcare industry, and ultimately better patient health outcomes.\n\nAbout Nabla\n\nNabla is the leading ambient AI assistant, reducing practitioner stress and improving patient care.

Nabla closely collaborated with CHLA's clinical team to tailor specific capabilities, ensuring that Copilot effectively met the unique requirements of pediatrics in a hospital setting. The top-ranked children's hospital in California, CHLA performs more than 15,000 surgeries and conducts more than 700,000 patient visits annually.\n\nIn a recent survey of physicians' mental health and well-being, pediatrics was the fourth-highest medical specialty experiencing burnout. A nationwide shortage of pediatric specialists has been fueling the high burnout rates, and onerous administrative workloads have exacerbated the situation. It'sestimated that every hour spent with patients requires two hours of administrative work, often demanding pediatricians' time and attention outside standard clinical hours. High burnout rates can lead tosevere consequences, including reduced job satisfaction and an increased likelihood of leaving the profession.\n\nNabla worked together with CHLA to accommodate their physician preferences and meet their patient population requirements:\n\nCustomized templates - Nabla built a template for CHLA's specific needs as a pediatric hospital. Nabla adapted their note templates specifically for CHLA's pediatric setting. Notes for example better reflect if some facts were reported by the patient or their parents, and clearly mention if the patient was accompanied during the encounter and by whom. In addition, CHLA practitioners have the ability to tailor their note templates to their exact needs, thanks to Nabla Copilot's custom instructions feature.\n\nMulti-speaker - Nabla will make it possible for Copilot to capture multiple people's voices in the exam room, including the parent or guardian speaking on behalf of a child patient.\n\nPatient instructions - after each encounter, Nabla Copilot automatically generates patient instructions in addition to the clinical note so that the patient and their family can have a summary of their next steps. In order to better support CHLA's context, practitioners can now choose between having these patient instructions addressed to the patient's parent or directly to the patient.\n\nSpanish language - to support CHLA's Spanish-speaking patients and parents, Nabla Copilot supports both English and Spanish languages. Physicians simply select \"Spanish\" before the consultation begins, and Nabla Copilot will understand the encounter, generate detailed clinical notes in English, and create patient instructions in Spanish so that the family is able to take home a summary in their preferred language.\n\nAmbient dot phrase - to reduce additional administrative work, Nabla introduced an ambient dot phrase feature. Pediatric specialists can voice their custom trigger expression (ie: \"nine-month physical exam is normal\") to automatically insert predefined content into a patient note.\n\nEHR integration - in line with its agnostic approach to EHR integrations, Nabla is developing an integration with CHLA's EHR system, Cerner.\n\nLike many healthcare providers, CHLA has rigorous policies in place to safeguard the privacy and security of its patients.

      "# [Nabla Bio secures $26m in Series A funding round by Vishnu Priyan on 2024-05-15](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/nabla-bio-series-a-funding/)\nUS pharmaceutical company Nabla Bio has secured $26m for generative protein design in a Series A financing round led by Radical Ventures.\n\nThe round included full participation from all existing investors.\n\nNabla has also entered strategic partnerships with Bristol Myers Squibb, AstraZeneca and Takeda.\n\nThese partnerships could exceed $550m in upfront and milestone payments, in addition to royalty payments.\n\nNabla Bio specialises in the integration of AI and wet-lab technologies for atomically precise drug design and the high-throughput evaluation of drug function.\n\nThe company’s initial focus is on antibodies that target multipass membrane proteins such as G protein-coupled receptors, ion channels and transporters.\n\nThese proteins are challenging to treat because of their membrane-integrated nature, reduced extracellular availability and structural similarity across targets.\n\nMultipass membrane proteins, which constitute two-thirds of all cell surface proteins, play a central role in controlling cell behaviour. They have long been considered the “holy grail” of protein drug development.\n\nNabla’s generative protein design platform is now making hundreds of these previously inaccessible targets available by enabling the accurate designing of conformation and target-selective antibody binders.\n\nTo enhance the patient impact of its platform, Nabla is collaborating with other pharmaceutical companies known for successful drug development.\n\nThese partnerships aim to enhance their pipelines with high-quality drug candidates targeting some of the most challenging and high-impact proteins.\n\nThey are also aimed at generating insights into disease biology and platform development.\n\nSince its launch in December 2021 with support from Khosla Ventures and Zetta Venture Partners, Nabla Bio has secured $37m in funding.\n\nNabla co-founder and CEO Surge Biswas stated: “We are unlocking new opportunities to build highly selective drugs against validated, but hard-to-drug targets with a degree of structural precision not previously possible.\n\n“We are excited to welcome Radical Ventures as our newest investor and to announce collaborations with three of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies to help us bring our work closer to patients.”",

      "# [Nabla, the AI copilot for doctors, nets $24M to transform medical consultations by Shubham Sharma on 2024-01-05](https://venturebeat.com/ai/nabla-the-ai-copilot-for-doctors-nets-24m-to-transform-medical-consultations/)\nNabla, a French startup building an AI copilot to accelerate how doctors work with patients, today announced it has raised $24 million in a series B round of funding.\n\nThe investment comes from Cathay Innovation and Zebox and will be used to build out Nabla’s offering and accelerate its rollout in the U.S. market. The funding takes the total capital raised by the company to $44.6 million.\n\nThere have been a lot of copilots, although their adoption in the healthcare sector has been slow due to the concerns of doctors and clinicians. With its AI copilot, Nabla appears to have broken that barrier, giving doctors a helper that sits on their desk and produces the desired results.\n\nWhat exactly does Nabla help with?\n\nNabla Copilot sits as a web app or Chrome extension on a doctor’s computer and listens to their consultation with patients. Then, using the encounter and the magic of AI, it generates clinical notes almost instantly, saving doctors the trouble of documenting the information manually.\n\nThese notes carry all the necessary information from the consultation, from the patient’s issue to their medical history and the medicines/tests prescribed to them. This information can then be reviewed/edited by the physician and filed into an electronic health record. The platform is also on track to get a feature that uses the discussion and examination to generate a set of patient instructions, on behalf of the physician. This letter can be saved as a PDF and printed for the patient.\n\nTo bring these capabilities to life, Nabla uses real-time speech-to-text AI. The model, a combination of Microsoft’s off-the-shelf speech-to-text API and fine-tuned Whisper model, generates the transcript of the conversation. This transcript is converted into a summarized clinical note using the GPT series of large language models (LLMs).\n\nNabla says all the personally identifiable information (PII) is masked when the LLM processes the transcription and unmasked once the output has been produced. Plus, neither the speech nor the summarized notes are stored, unless explicitly consented to by the physician and the patient.\n\nSignificant impact in less than 10 months\n\nHistorically, physicians have had to spend up to 40% of their day documenting consultations. With Nabla, the problem is just gone. In just 10 months of its launch, the copilot has been adopted by more than 20,000 providers. The company also claims that it will soon hit three million consultations.\n\n“With Nabla, I am finally getting my weekends back. What took 8-10 hours now takes maybe 3-4 hours. Better yet, because I no longer need to be a scribe, I get to actually be a psychologist and focus on my patients! After only a couple of months, I can’t imagine my practice without Nabla,” M. Tursich, a psychologist at Mankato Clinic, said in a statement.\n\nThe company claims that the fine-tuned models provide highly accurate outputs, with only 5% of the notes requiring adjustments. Our tests on the web app also provided similar outcomes. This is expected to get even better as the models improve in the near future.\n\nNabla plans to use this funding to expand the reach of its copilot in the U.S., but its ultimate goal is to build an AI-driven future for physicians. The company aims to build the “most intuitive and reliable ambient AI” to support them across the clinical spectrum up until medical decision support. It will also use the fresh capital to launch additional language options for the assistant.\n\nCurrently, Nabla Copilot can be accessed by any email, not just the official provider email, and supports three languages: English, Spanish, and French.",
