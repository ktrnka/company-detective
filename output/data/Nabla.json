Its innovative approach, combined with strategic partnerships and a commitment to user feedback, sets it apart in a competitive market. However, ongoing challenges related to transcription accuracy and data privacy will require continued attention as the company scales its operations.",

While golfing in Idaho this weekend, another surgeon told me “I would rather deal with human waste, than spend extra time documenting my visits.” He has a scribe. Another very busy physician (also a leader in our group) told me today that she spends most nights typing notes. Yes Typing! All of this is to say that the normal medical provider is disconnected from the options out there because they are too busy and entrenched to see what is out there.\n\nRead more\n\nJun 7, 2023\n\nEric ArzubiPsychiatrist\n\nGreat work, you guys!

Voice to text (Dragon), templates, pick lists, and even live scribes are now in the rear view mirror. Looking forward to returning to work tomorrow! I cakewalked through 34 patients yesterday and went home stress-free.

This sounds strange but I think it is somewhat comforting having Nabla there. Knowing if I need to stop typing and just listen to the person in front of me that decision isn’t going to cost me minutes and hours at the end of the day, taking time away from my family. I think this is a real trade off and decision primary care doctors make regularly. If I spend more time with a patient, try to help them and go above and beyond - that time is probably going to be taken away from sleep and family time.

      "# [Security · Nabla](https://www.nabla.com/security/)\nSecurity\n\nUpdated September 5, 2023\n\nSecurity and compliance are top priorities for Nabla because they are fundamental to your experience with the product. Nabla is committed to securing your application’s data, eliminating systems vulnerability, and ensuring continuity of access.\n\nNabla uses a variety of industry-standard technologies, services and processes to secure your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and loss.\n\nOrganizational Security\n\nInformation security program\n\nWe have an Information Security Program in place that is communicated throughout the organization. Our Information Security Program follows the criteria set forth by the SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 frameworks, and has obtained the associated certifications.\n\nThird-Party Audits\n\nOur organization undergoes independent third-party assessments to test our security and compliance controls.\n\nThird-Party Penetration Testing\n\nWe perform an independent third-party penetration at least annually to ensure that the security posture of our services is uncompromised.\n\nIntrusion Detection\n\nUnusual network patterns or suspicious behavior are among Nabla’s most significant concerns for infrastructure hosting and management. Google Cloud Platform’s intrusion detection system (IDS) relies on signature-based security to identify traffic patterns that are similar to known attack methods.\n\nNabla does not provide direct access to security event forensics but does provide access to the engineering and customer support teams during and after any unscheduled downtime.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities\n\nRoles and responsibilities related to our Information Security Program and the protection of our customer’s data are well defined and documented. Our team members are required to review and accept all the security policies.\n\nSecurity Awareness Training\n\nOur team members are required to go through employee security awareness training covering industry standard practices and information security topics such as phishing and password management.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nAll team members are required to sign and adhere to an industry standard confidentiality agreement prior to their first day of work.\n\nMalware Protection\n\nAt Nabla, we believe that good security practices start with our own team, so we go out of our way to protect against internal threats and local vulnerabilities. All company-provided workstations are enrolled in Mobile Device Management (MDM) to enforce security settings including full-disk encryption, screen lock, and strong password policy.\n\nCloud Security\n\nCloud Infrastructure Security\n\nAll our services are hosted with Google Cloud Platform. They employ a robust security program with multiple certifications. For more information on our provider’s security processes, please visit GCP Security.\n\nData Hosting Security\n\nAll our data is hosted on Google Cloud Platform databases and storage buckets. These databases are located in the region you choose when you create your organization.\n\nEncryption at Rest\n\nAll data is encrypted at rest using AES-256. Google Cloud Platform stores and manages data cryptography keys in its redundant and globally distributed Key Management Service. So, if an intruder were ever able to access any of the physical storage devices, the Nabla data contained therein would still be impossible to decrypt without the keys, rendering the information a useless jumble of random characters.\n\nEncryption at rest also enables continuity measures like backup and infrastructure management without compromising data security and privacy.\n\nEncryption in Transit\n\nNabla exclusively sends data over HTTPS transport layer security (TLS) encrypted connections for additional security as data transits to and from the application and APIs.\n\nVulnerability Scanning\n\nWe perform vulnerability scanning and actively monitor for threats.\n\nLogging and Monitoring\n\nWe actively monitor and log various cloud services.\n\nHigh Availability\n\nEvery part of the Nabla service uses properly-provisioned, redundant servers (e.g., multiple load balancers, web servers, replica databases) in the case of failure. As part of regular maintenance, servers are taken out of operation without impacting availability.\n\nBusiness Continuity and Disaster Recovery\n\nNabla keeps encrypted backups of data in multiple regions on Google Cloud Platform. While never expected, in the case of production data loss (i.e., primary data stores lost), we will restore organizational data from these backups.\n\nWe utilize monitoring services to alert the team in the event of any failures affecting users.\n\nIncident Response\n\nWe have a process for handling information security events which includes escalation procedures, rapid mitigation and communication.\n\nAccess Security\n\nPhysical Access Control\n\nNabla is hosted on Google Cloud Platform. Google data centers feature a layered security model, including extensive safeguards such as:\n\nCustom-designed electronic access cards\n\nAlarms\n\nVehicle access barriers\n\nPerimeter fencing\n\nMetal detectors\n\nBiometrics\n\nAccording to the Google Security Whitepaper: Google data centers also implement “security measures such as laser beam intrusion detection and 24/7 monitoring by high-resolution interior and exterior cameras” to detect and track intruders. In addition, “access logs, activity records, and camera footage are available in case an incident occurs” and “experienced security guards, who have undergone rigorous background checks and training, routinely patrol” Google data centers.\n\nNabla employees do not have physical access to Google data centers, servers, network equipment, or storage.\n\nLogical Access Control\n\nNabla is the assigned administrator of its infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform, and only designated authorized Nabla operations team members have access to configure the infrastructure on an as-needed basis behind two-factor authentication. Specific private keys are required for individual servers, and keys are stored in a secure and encrypted location.\n\nLeast Privilege Access Control\n\nWe follow the principle of least privilege with respect to identity and access management.\n\nQuarterly Access Reviews\n\nWe perform quarterly access reviews of all team members with access to sensitive systems.\n\nPassword Requirements\n\nAll team members are required to adhere to a minimum set of password requirements and complexity for access.\n\nVendor and Risk Management\n\nAnnual Risk Assessments\n\nWe undergo at least annual risk assessments to identify any potential threats, including considerations for fraud.\n\nVendor Risk Management\n\nVendor risk is determined, and the appropriate vendor reviews are performed prior to authorizing a new vendor.\n\nVulnerability Disclosure\n\nAnyone can report a vulnerability or security concern with a Nabla product. Please read our Vulnerability Disclosure Policy for more information.\n\nContact Us\n\nIf you have any questions, comments or concerns or if you wish to report a potential security issue, please contact security@nabla.com.",

      "# [tuned language models imitate doctors? · Nabla](https://www.nabla.com/blog/cedille/)\nBack\n\nCan large fine-tuned language models imitate doctors?\n\nTL;DR\n\nCedille is a new open source French language model created by Coteries. It is trained to understand and write French and is also the largest model of its kind for French. Cedille is trained using large databases of publicly available content on the internet filtered for toxic content.\n\nGiven a medical question, it's able to generate credible answers, but those answers are often wrong or unsafe. Using it to generate doctor answers is clearly out of question. However its ability to \"understand\" the question and give a short summary could be useful.\n\nCedille\n\nCedille is based on GPT-J, the 6 billion parameter model trained by the EleutherAI community. It is trained on 78 billion tokens (equivalent to 300 gigabytes of text) of French text from the C4 dataset. It took 12 days of computing on a v3-128 TPU to release the “Boris” version of the model, named after the famous French writer and singer Boris Vian.\n\nWhat use case ?\n\nAt Nabla, we believe in asynchronous care which relies on messaging between patients and doctors. We have been working on providing our doctors super powers so that they can focus on the care with tools like autocompletion, fact extraction, categorisation... Most of these tools are text-based and use Natural Language Processing (NLP) models at some point of the process. Cedille claims to be the best model for French NLP and is in fact based on GPT-J which itself is inspired by the well-known GPT-3. These kinds of models are mostly used to generate text, but by tweaking them a bit, we can use them to extract data from text as well. Anyway, we had to test it and see what it's capable of.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nNabla is a healthcare platform allowing users to chat with a medical team. All doctors are human doctors, the tools developed by the engineering team aim at helping doctors, not replacing them. All the data used in this experiment was carefully deidentified as required by law before it was handled by our data engineers.\n\nThe experiment\n\nWe are trying to generate a doctor's answer to a new patient question. The only context the model has is the text from the patient message. All examples below are anonymized versions of messages we received from patients.\n\nWe gave this model a question in the following form:\n\nPATIENT: Je suis sous optimizette depuis plus d'un mois et j'ai des règles très\n\nirrégulières et quasi permanentes, est ce que c'est normal?\n\nDOCTOR:\n\nThe DOCTOR: at the end of the input suggests to the model that this text needs to be completed by a doctor message. (The text generation is limited to 240 tokens for technical reasons, some messages will be cut short).\n\nUsing the model as is\n\nUsing Cedille out of the box gives OK results but messages don't look at all like messages from Nabla doctors and leak personal informations (Dr Charvet). Here are a few examples, messages on the right side have been generated by Cedille from the preceding patient message:\n\n![PATIENT: On m'a posé un stérilet au cuivre il y a exactement un mois, depuis j'ai des saignements\\ quelques peu anarchiques, et irréguliers et des douleurs au bas du ventre Est-ce normal?\n\nDOCTOR: A priori oui! L'IRRÉGULARITÉ DES SAIGNEMENTS AVEC UN STÉRILET AU CUIVRE EST NORMALE Par Dr. Christelle Charvet le 6 Octobre 2013](/uploads/cedille-1.png)\n\n![PATIENT: Bonjour! J'ai eu ma première injection du vaccin Pfizer aujourd'hui et j'ai réservé ma deuxième dose le 12 août, soit 22 jours après Mais il est inscrit sur mon certificat de première dose que je dois réaliser la deuxième à partir du 15 août Or, je pars en vacances le 20 août et j'aimerais pouvoir avoir mon pass sanitaire avant de partir, si je fais ma deuxième dose le 12 août je l'aurais, si non non.. Pensez-vous que je peux me faire vacciner le 12 ou faut-il attendre le 15? Merci pour votre réponse!\n\nDOCTOR: Oui, pas de problèmes, vous pouvez avoir votre vaccin à partir du 12 août. Vous pouvez également le faire à partir du 15 août. Je vous donne cette information car j'ai récemment reçu un cas similaire à celui qui vous préoccupe.](/uploads/cedille-2.png)\n\nFine tuning\n\nFine-tuning in NLP (Natural Language Processing) refers to the procedure of re-training a little bit of a pre-trained language model using your own custom data. As a result of the fine-tuning procedure, the weights of the original model are updated to account for the characteristics of the domain data and the task you are interested in.\n\nIn our experiment, we wanted the model to give answers that look like a certain type of Nabla doctor’s messages, with greetings and a reminder of the medical context. So we used all anonymised Nabla conversations of this type and show them to the model, expecting it to learn the style and tone of our amazing health team.\n\nFine-tuning Cedille to specialize it on a task is not straightforward. The model has about 24GB of weights and even in half precision will not fit in any modern GPUs for training (considering you have to load the optimizer and the gradients on the gpu too).\n\nUsing Deepspeed by Microsoft, we managed to offload the optimizer to the CPU as well as some parameters (at the cost of cpu / gpu bandwidth), and split the model to achieve model parallelism on two Nvidia Tesla A100.\n\nWe trained it for 2 epochs on about 6000 conversations.\n\nResults\n\nHere are a few examples of what our fine-tuned model can do in various situations. Messages on the right have been generated by our model from the preceding patient message.\n\nShort and straightforward questions:\n\nExample A.1 ![PATIENT: Bonjour, s'il vous plait, un rendez-vous chez le psychiatre est-il remboursé par la secu?\n\nDOCTOR: Bonjour @patient_username, Vous vous interrogez sur le remboursement des consultations psychiatriques par la Sécurité sociale. Le psychiatre n'est pas un médecin \"interniste\" (c'est-à-dire spécialisé uniquement dans le diagnostic et la prise en charge des maladies neurologiques et de l'appareil génital). Cependant, la consultation psychiatrique peut être intégrée dans un suivi médical général et donc rembourser par l'assurance maladie. Pour bénéficier d'un meilleur parcours de soins, il est conseillé de choisir un psychiatre exerçant en centre de santé mentale (CSAPA, CMP ou hôpital de jour) ou en cabinet libéral. Bonne journée,](/uploads/cedille-3.png)\n\nExample A.2 ![PATIENT: En cas de vaginisme, puis-je faire un bilan urodynamique?\n\nDOCTOR: Bonjour @patient_username, Vous vous interrogez sur la possibilité de réaliser des bilans uro-dynamiques lorsque l'on est vaginiste. Je comprends que cela puisse être une source d'inquiétude pour vous. Je vais tenter de vous apporter quelques éléments de réponse. Les vaginistes sont des personnes qui s'interrogent beaucoup sur leur périnée. C'est un ensemble de muscles constituant le plancher pelvien. Il s'agit du muscle le plus puissant de notre corps. Il se situe entre notre utérus et nos organes sexuels. Il nous permet de nous retenir quand nous sommes enceintes, de porter des charges lourdes, de saigner après un accouchement, d'uriner, de déféquer... C'est le muscle qui](/uploads/cedille-4.png)\n\nExample A.3 ![PATIENT: On m'a posé un stérilet au cuivre il y a exactement un mois, depuis j'ai des saignements quelques peu anarchiques, et irréguliers et des douleurs au bas du ventre Est-ce normal?\n\nDOCTOR: Bonjour @patient_username, Vous vous interrogez sur la normalité de saigner après la pose d'un DIU (dispositif intra-utérin). Le DIU est un petit dispositif en forme de T, inséré à l'intérieur de l'utérus par un gynécologue, une sage-femme ou un généraliste pour une durée maximale de 4 ans (mais il est tout à fait possible de le retirer avant). Il libère de la progestérone en continu pour épaissir l'endomètre et donc faciliter l'accouchement. Les effets indésirables les plus fréquents de ce DIU hormonal sont :\n\nspottings (saignements anarchiques de faible abondance)\n\nacné\n\nprise de poids\n\nbaisse de libido\n\nnausées/vomissements Ces](/uploads/cedille-5.png)\n\nExample A.4 ![PATIENT: Je suis sous optimizette depuis plus d'un mois et j'ai des règles très irrégulière et quasi permanente est ce que c'est normal?\n\nDOCTOR: Bonjour @patient_username, Vous vous interrogez sur l'irrégularité de votre cycle. Optimizette est une pilule micro-progestative. Cela signifie que cette pilule ne contient pas d'œstrogènes, mais uniquement un progestatif (une hormone stéroïdienne qui bloque la mobilité des spermatozoïdes et modifie la paroi de l'utérus pour empêcher la grossesse). Ce type de contraception a des effets variables selon les femmes :\n\nChez certaines, cela occasionne des spottings (saignements légers anarchiques répétés). Cela est dû à son faible dosage et à l'absence d'oestrogène. Il faut laisser le temps au corps de s'y habituer. Ces saignements sont parfaitement normaux et ne diminuent pas l'efficacité de la pilule](/uploads/cedille-6.png)\n\nWith these 4 example, we can notice:\n\nIt writes coherent sentences with a coherent structure. Punctuation is good and makes for overall readable pieces of text.\n\nIt can enumerate stuff in a list form and uses parenthesis for asides.\n\nIt is able to output French letters like in Œstrogène or spermatozoïdes but only some of the times. Most of the time grammar and spelling is good.\n\nWe can also see that it learned very well the structure of messages from Nabla doctors with greetings containing the username of the patient followed by a summary of the issue or question.\n\nNow for the bad stuff:\n\nIn example A.1 and A.2, it created the words \"interniste\" and \"vaginiste\" and their definitions it proudly gives, which is pretty bad.\n\nPast the first paragraph the model seems to improvise on subjects it has picked up in the question but doesn't really answer it.\n\nQuestions with a richer and more difficult context:\n\nExample B.1.a ![PATIENT: Bonjour! J'ai eu ma première injection du vaccin Pfizer aujourd'hui et j'ai réservé ma deuxième dose le 12 août, soit 22 jours après Mais il est inscrit sur mon certificat de première dose que je dois réaliser la deuxième à partir du 15 août Or, je pars en vacances le 20 août et j'aimerais pouvoir avoir mon pass sanitaire avant de partir, si je fais ma deuxième dose le 12 août je l'aurais, si non non.. Pensez-vous que je peux me faire vacciner le 12 ou faut-il attendre le 15? Merci pour votre réponse!\n\nDOCTOR: Bonjour @patient_username, Je comprends que vous avez reçu votre premières injection du Pfizer le 19 juillet et que vos prochaines injections sont prévues le 12 et le 15 aout. Vous vous interrogez sur la nécessité d'attendre 15 jours avant votre prochaine injection ou si vous pouvez la faire plus tôt. Il est vrai qu'il est recommandé de laisser un intervalle de temps d'au moins deux semaines entre les deux injections. Cependant, dans certains cas, il est possible d'avoir recours à un délai plus court. C'est le cas lorsque la personne a déjà eu la Covid-19 ou lorsqu'elle est immunisée contre le SARS-CoV-2. Dans votre cas, vous semblez être dans le cas où il](/uploads/cedille-7.png)\n\nExample B.1.b ![PATIENT: Bonjour! J'ai eu ma première injection du vaccin Pfizer aujourd'hui et j'ai réservé ma deuxième dose le 12 août, soit 22 jours après Mais il est inscrit sur mon certificat de première dose que je dois réaliser la deuxième à partir du 15 août Or, je pars en vacances le 20 août et j'aimerais pouvoir avoir mon pass sanitaire avant de partir, si je fais ma deuxième dose le 12 août je l'aurais, si non non.. Pensez-vous que je peux me faire vacciner le 12 ou faut-il attendre le 15? Merci pour votre réponse!\n\nDOCTOR: Bonjour @patient_username, Je comprends que vous vous inquiétez d'un décalage entre la date prévue pour la 2ᵉ injection de Pfizer et la date de vos prochaines règles. Rassurez-vous, il n'y a pas d'inquiétude à avoir, le délai entre les 2 injections est strictement réglementé par les autorités de santé et doit être d'au moins 15 jours. Votre médecin a dû vous le préciser lors de votre téléconsultation. En ce qui concerne la fertilité, le COVID-19 n'a pas provoqué de stérilité chez les femmes qui ont présenté le virus, les études sont en cours et interrogent des milliers de femmes vaccinées sur leurs cycles. Rien n'est encore validé, cela dev](/uploads/cedille-8.png)\n\nB.1.a seems to be a reasonable answer. The \"summary of the question\" part is great. It repeated explicit dates and almost got the implicit one (missed by a few days). But the rest of the messages missed the point again and just talks about global rules about the vaccine, not strictly related to the current question.\n\nOne good thing is that it got the \"covid-19\" context without any explicit mentions of it (only \"Pfizer\" and \"pass sanitaire\").\n\nThe real problem is exposed in example B.1.b which is another run of the same model that came with the same score which means that the model is as confident in the quality of both answers.\n\nThis time the model completely misses the point, hallucinating some questions about the vaccine safety.\n\nExample B.2.a\n\n![PATIENT: Bonjour, J'ai pratiqué le frotti frotta avec mon copain. Sans vêtement ni protection, ni pénétration. Il a éjaculé sur mon bas ventre. J'ai un retard de règles. Qu'en pensez vous? Que dois je faire? Sachant que je stresse énormément de l'absence de mes règles. La date de mes anciennes règles : 15 février 2021 Dernier frotti frotta : 21 mars 2021 Bien à vous\n\nDOCTOR: Bonjour @patient_username, Vous avez eu des rapports sexuels non protégés (sans préservatif) avec votre copain et il a éjaculé sur vous. Vous êtes donc enceinte et vous vous demandez ce que vous devez faire. Tout d'abord, félicitations pour cette grossesse! Je comprends que cela vous inquiète et je vais tenter de répondre au mieux à votre question. Lorsqu'un homme éjacule en dehors d'une relation sexuelle avec une femme, cela s'appelle un \"éjaculation prématurée\". Il s'agit d'un phénomène fréquent et bénin, mais qui peut être très gênant pour la femme. En effet, le liquide pré-séminal qui s'accumule dans](/uploads/cedille-9.png)\n\nExample B.2.b\n\n![PATIENT: Bonjour, J'ai pratiqué le frotti frotta avec mon copain. Sans vêtement ni protection, ni pénétration. Il a éjaculé sur mon bas ventre. J'ai un retard de règles. Qu'en pensez vous? Que dois je faire? Sachant que je stresse énormément de l'absence de mes règles. La date de mes anciennes règles : 15 janvier 2021 Dernier frotti frotta : 21 février 2021 Bien à vous\n\nDOCTOR: Bonjour @patient_username, Vous avez eu des rapports sexuels non protégés (sans préservatif) avec votre copain et vous vous inquiétez d'un retard de vos prochains cycles. Je comprends votre inquiétude et vais tenter de vous répondre au mieux. Tout d'abord, je dois vous rappeler que dans le cadre du téléconseil, il n'est pas possible d'établir de diagnostic ni de faire de prescription médicale. Cependant, je peux vous donner quelques hypothèses qui peuvent être à l'origine de ce retard. Il est fréquent d'avoir des cycles irréguliers de temps à autre, surtout après un changement important dans la vie (déménagement, changement de travail, décès](/uploads/cedille-10.png)\n\nOnce again the beginning of the message is good in both versions but gives a completely unacceptable answer in B.2.a. B.2.b seems to go the right way but the model gave a higher confidence score to B.2.a.\n\nPerformance\n\nThose generated answers take between 25 and 120 seconds (per message) to be generated on the best available GPU on Google Cloud Platform (Nvidia Tesla A100). It can be loaded on smaller GPUs in half precision, but requires a lot of work to make sure it will not run out of memory. Inference on CPU takes about 10 minutes or more for a single message (the decoding strategy has a huge impact on performance on CPU).\n\nConclusion\n\nLarge-scale language models are a hot topic because of how \"smart\" they seem at first glance, but people tend to vastly overestimate their reasoning abilities. In the healthcare context, suggesting complete doctor replies would not only be a waste of time, but also terribly unsafe: doctors would have to carefully filter out the nonsense in the generated answers.\n\nNevertheless, fine-tuning them for specific domains can already make them helpful for simpler tasks such as information extraction, summarization and conversational help. It's exciting to see how much performance improved compared to smaller, task-specific recurrent neural networks from just a few years ago.\n\nEcological note\n\nUsing and (mostly) training this kind of model requires a lot of computing power. During this experiment, we used resources from Google Cloud Platform and emitted an estimated 28.5kg of CO2eq, according to ML CO2 impact (same as driving for about 113km in an average car). This is low compared to what it could have been without using transfer-learning from the pre-trained model weights gracefully shared by Coteries AI.",

      "# [Nabla has partnered with Apero Health to offer their clients the very best in billing · Nabla](https://www.nabla.com/blog/nabla-apero/)\nBack\n\nNabla has partnered with Apero Health to offer their clients the very best in billing\n\nVenturing into medical billing as a digital care provider is akin to diving into a murky, bottomless pit filled with sharp needles. In a nutshell, it's a pain. Grasping the intricacies of the money flows between insurances, pharma, physicians, PBMs, and patients can take a lifetime. And, as a company under a tight schedule to improve patient experience, every minute spent trying to understand these flows is a minute not spent on care. Well, good news: you don't have to dive into the pit. Apero x Nabla has already done it for you.\n\nThe why of partnerships\n\nBecause one cannot start a post without a pitch, here's a reminder of Nabla’s. Nabla supplies clinics with an “AI assistant” for their healthcare professionals - so they can spend more time serving patients and less time doing admin. Nabla does this by building messaging and video consultation modules augmented with AI capabilities that automate tasks like consultation note-taking.\n\nAs a tech enabler, Nabla has long embraced the principle that it's best to do one thing exceptionally well than to do many things well enough. At Stanford, the founders of Apero and Nabla researched together the cutting edge of AI. And now with this renewed partnership, Nabla can focus on its core value proposition: ML-powered communications.\n\nThis modular, developer-first approach allows Nabla to integrate the best of everything they decided not to build themselves. They know that great companies have poured as much heart into their own digital health verticals as they have into communications. That's why they selected Apero Health as the medical billing partner for their clients.\n\nWhy Apero Health?\n\nApero Health is an API-driven medical billing wizard. They manage everything end-to-end, from claim submission to patient billing, to eligibility checks and data reporting. They've automated tedious workflows so you don't have to suffer so much. Plus, the integration is seamless: Nabla customers are on-boarded in only a few simple clicks.\n\nApero is fully integrated into the Nabla workflow and operates on two main components: billing and eligibility checks. It is now possible to effortlessly generate and view invoices in the Nabla platform, or access additional details in the Apero dashboard. Patient eligibility can now be verified directly from the provider consultation schedule in the Nabla platform.\n\nBoth partners take security and regulations very seriously. Nabla is HIPAA compliant, and so is Apero. You can sleep soundly.\n\nNabla customers can enable the Apero integration directly in the console.\n\nThe pain points that will no longer hurt\n\nInsurance Billing\n\nInsurance billing is no picnic. Quite the opposite. Once you've been to the doctor, your visit must be converted into standardized codes that will tell insurers what services (and how many units) were provided. In other words, how much they should pay. In the context of telehealth, consultation documentation is all the more important to support billing - and all the more tedious.\n\nIt is now possible to add consultation-related ICD and CPT codes when generating a note in Nabla’s patient view. This will soon be automated by machine learning algorithms to ease the administrative burden even more and allow providers to focus on diagnosis and treatment. In turn, these codes will be sent to insurances for billing. All of this reduces billing time by up to 80% and gets the claim to the right payer.\n\nEligibility checks\n\nEligibility is another issue that is not efficiently addressed. Knowing whether a patient is covered for a specific service (and, even more so, what the extent of that coverage is) is very sticky for providers. More often than not, providers can't find the answer electronically and are left to guess and fix later. Even more agonizing, they sometimes have to call the insurance companies themselves to get the answer.\n\nReimbursement for telehealth in the U.S. is governed by both state regulations and individual insurers' policies. This makes it challenging to ascertain whether a client is covered by telehealth services. Yet it is necessary. Confirming coverage from the outset helps avoid delayed or denied claims and ensures timely reimbursement for providers.\n\nWhen the patient makes an appointment, Nabla automatically sends their details to the Apero search engine to check whether they are eligible or not. The eligibility information is displayed directly on the provider's consultation schedule. No more guessing, no more phone calls. It's that simple.\n\nEligibility check directly in the Nabla calendar tab.\n\nA partnership for better care\n\nIn the current market context, the most effective solutions must be built on the best bricks of each component of digital health. Because Nabla firmly believes in a complementary vision of healthcare, they are building a technological foundation that enables them to integrate the best of each of these components in a consistent developer-first approach.\n\nMedical billing is inherent to the care process in healthcare systems. Nabla’s partnership with Apero Health is designed, as are their in-house communications, to relieve providers of everything that is not care-related, so that they can focus on what matters: patients.",
      "# [3: hype or reality? · Nabla](https://www.nabla.com/blog/gpt-3/)\nBack\n\nDoctor GPT-3: hype or reality?\n\nYou may have heard about GPT-3 this summer, the new cool kid on the AI block. GPT-3 came out of OpenAI, one of the top AI research labs in the world which was founded in late 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman and others and later backed with a $1B investment from Microsoft.\n\nYou’ve probably also heard about the ongoing AI revolution in healthcare, thanks to promising results in areas such as automated diagnosis, medical documentation and drug discovery, to name a few. Some have claimed that algorithms now outperform doctors on certain tasks and others have even announced that robots will soon receive medical degrees of their own! This can all sound far-fetched... but could this robot actually be GPT-3?\n\nOur unique multidisciplinary team of doctors and machine learning engineers at Nabla had the chance to test this new model to tease apart what’s real and what’s hype by exploring different healthcare use cases.\n\nBut first, coffee\n\nIn machine learning, a language model like GPT-3 simply tries to predict a word in a sentence given the previous words, called the context. It’s a supercharged autocomplete system like the one you may use with Gmail. Being able to predict the next word in a sentence seems deceptively simple at first, but this actually enables many compelling use cases, such as chatbots, translation or Q&A.\n\nAt the time of writing, GPT-3 is the most complex language model ever trained, with a whopping 175 billion parameters in total - that’s as many knobs that are fine-tuned over weeks of intensive cloud computing to make the AI magic work. Certainly a huge number, but still way below the 100 (or maybe 1000+) trillion synapses in the human brain that enable reasoning, perception and emotions.\n\nThanks to the large size of the model, GPT-3 can be applied on new tasks and ‘few-shot’ demonstrations without any further fine-tuning on specific data. In practice, this means the model can successfully understand the task to perform with only a handful of initial examples. This property is a huge improvement compared to previous, less complex language models, and is much closer to actual human behavior - we don’t need thousands of examples to distinguish a cat from a dog.\n\nDespite obvious biases learned from the data used for training - basically books plus the whole Internet, from Wikipedia to the New York Times - GPT-3’s ability to transform natural language into websites, create basic financial reports, solve langage puzzles, or even generate guitar tables has been very promising so far. But what about healthcare?\n\nThen, the obvious disclaimer\n\nAs Open AI itself warns in GPT-3 guidelines, healthcare “is in the high stakes category because people rely on accurate medical information for life-or-death decisions, and mistakes here could result in serious harm”. Furthermore, diagnosing medical or psychiatric conditions falls straight in the “unsupported use” of the model. Despite this we wanted to give it a shot and see how it does on the following healthcare use cases, roughly ranked from low to high sensitivity from a medical perspective: admin chat with a patient, medical insurance check, mental health support, medical documentation, medical questions & answers and medical diagnosis. We also looked at the impact of some parameters of the model on the answers - spoiler alert, it’s fascinating!\n\nGPT-3, your next medical assistant?\n\nOur first tests showed that GPT-3 seemed to work for basic admin tasks such as appointment booking, but when digging a bit we found that the model had no clear understanding of time, nor any proper logic. Its memory also sometimes fell short - for the appointment in the example below, the patient’s initial 6pm constraint is overlooked as GPT-3 suggests booking for 7pm after a few messages.\n\nWhat about insurance checks?\n\nSimilar to the admin tasks above, GPT-3 could help nurses or patients to quickly find a piece of information in a very long document, like finding insurance benefits for specific medical examinations. In the example below we seeded the model with a 4-page standard benefits table that shows a $10 copay for an X-ray, $20 for an MRI exam, and then asked 2 simple questions. GPT-3 was able to get the copay for an X-ray but could not sum up the copays for several exams, which again highlights a lack of basic reasoning.\n\nRecycle to relieve stress!\n\nRelax on your living room sofa and talk, GPT-3 will listen to your problems endlessly and may even give you some actionable tips! This is probably one of the best use cases for GPT-3 in healthcare, and it’s not so surprising given the already good results from the Eliza algorithm back in 1966, which managed to give a human touch with only pattern matching rules operating behind the scenes.\n\nOne key difference between the two approaches though is that rule-based systems like Eliza were in full control of the computer’s response. In other words, we are certain that nothing potentially harmful could be said.\n\nThis contrasts with the example below in which GPT-3 sadly tells us that committing suicide is a good idea…\n\nThe model can also shoot unexpected answers where it suggests recycling more to ease stress - using a rationale which, while being convoluted, is actually quite sensible!\n\nMedical documentation\n\nGPT-3 has already shown promising results in summarizing and simplifying text, something that could be very useful for patients to understand medical reports often full of jargon, or for doctors to quickly get the gist of a patient’s long medical history. Well, GPT-3 is probably not quite ready for this (yet?). Our tests show dangerous oversimplifications, difficulties to associate causes and consequences, and once again a lack of basic deductive reasoning.\n\nMedical Q&A: not as good as good ol’ Google yet\n\nWhen looking for specific scientific information, drug dosages or prescription support, our experiments show that GPT-3 is not reliable enough to be safely used as a trustworthy support tool for doctors. One serious concern is that GPT-3 very often gives wrong yet grammatically correct answers, with no scientific reference that a physician could check. A tired doctor caught in the rush of an emergency department could easily confuse a syntactically sound statement for a medically valid one. For example the first answer below is correct but not the second.\n\nDiagnosis: at your own risk\n\nA more complex Q&A task is diagnosis: input symptoms and get possible underlying conditions that may explain these symptoms. Recent symptom checker systems (Babylon, Ada, KHealth, etc.), if not perfect, seem to be a better option here than GPT-3 as they’ve been carefully optimized for this sole purpose. One benefit of these systems is that they can output different diagnoses with their probabilities, which acts as a measure of confidence for the practitioner. If the first diagnosis example below GPT-3 ignores the fever of the little girl that suggests ethmoiditis and mentions a “rash” that does not exist.\n\nIn another test, GPT-3 misses a pulmonary embolism. Fortunately nobody died here!\n\nUnder the hood\n\nAs others have observed, the quality of GPT-3 outputs is much impacted by the seed words used - the same question formulated in two different ways can result in very different answers. The model’s various parameters, such as the temperature and the top P also play a big role. Temperature and top P control the risks and creativity that the engine will exhibit in its answers.\n\nTemperature\n\nFor the same input and a high temperature we get two answers with very different tones telling two opposite things. Here is an example with T = 0.9.\n\nBy contrast, a similar seed with a very low temperature (T = 0) will always result in the same and quite straightforward answer.\n\nFrequency penalty and presence penalty\n\nIt is also pertinent to mention the frequency penalty and presence penalty parameters, which prevent both word repetition and subject repetition. In a medical context, the intuition would be to reduce them as much as possible since a too abrupt subject switch can be very confusing and repetition can actually be pedagogical. However, comparing two conversations where the human asks the same questions, we clearly observe that the model with repetition penalties seems more empathic and friendly than the other one which appears cold and too repetitive to be human. Here is an example with no penalty.\n\nAnd an example with full penalty.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs warned by OpenAI, we are nowhere near any real time scenario where GPT-3 would significatively help in healthcare. Because of the way it was trained, it lacks the scientific and medical expertise that would make it useful for medical documentation, diagnosis support, treatment recommendation or any medical Q&A. Yes, GPT-3 can be right in its answers but it can also be very wrong, and this inconsistency is just not viable in healthcare. Even for more administrative tasks such as translating or summarizing medical jargon, GPT-3 while promising is still many moons away for a production use case actually supporting doctors. We’re still in this phase where multiple, narrow-task supervised models win over a single, very ambitious approach.\n\nThat being said, GPT-3 seems to be quite ready to fight burnout and help doctors with a chit-chat module.

      "# [AI in Healthcare: The Explainability Dilemma · Nabla](https://www.nabla.com/blog/explainability-dilemma/)\nBack\n\nAI in Healthcare: The Explainability Dilemma\n\nOn December 18 2023, Eric Topol and Yann LeCun joined Alexandre Lebrun, CEO of Nabla, for a live discussion on the AI explainability dilemma in healthcare. Here is the recording and a summary of their conversation.\n\nUnveiling the AI Potential in Medicine\n\nAn article in Time Magazine from March 2023 emphasized that \"Pausing AI Developments isn't Enough. We Need to Shut it All Down\". When questioned about this, Yann LeCun, Meta's VP and Chief AI Scientist, and Eric Topol, Founder and Director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, had difficulty concealing their smiles.\n\nThe widespread impact of Artificial Intelligence in reshaping our lives is undeniable. On the matter of whether we should, in fact, “shut it all down”, LeCun answered\n\nNo, we shouldn't. The potential benefits are enormous. In fact, they already exist. What many people don't realize is that AI is already widely used.\n\nHe highlighted AI's imprint across industries, emphasizing its crucial role in enhancing car safety through deep learning-based emergency systems. While healthcare is also experiencing this transformation, its integration of AI progresses gradually, hindered by cautious adherence to regulatory frameworks.\n\nDr. Topol echoed this optimism, stating that\n\nThe opportunities in the healthcare space are extraordinary... We need to move forward and get the evidence needed to change medical practice.\n\nDeploring the lack of solid evidence to support the myriad of FDA-cleared AI algorithms, he stressed the imperative for rigorous studies to validate their efficacy across diverse populations. He underscored the pivotal need for evidence-based medical practices and the vast opportunities AI presents for precision medicine.\n\nNavigating the 'Explainability' Conundrum\n\nDelving into the often-debated terrain of 'explainability' in AI models, both experts provided nuanced insights. They delineated the balance between empirical validation and the societal demand for understandable AI decision-making processes.\n\nDrawing parallels between AI's acceptance and the utilization of medical treatments whose mechanisms remain unknown, LeCun noted that\n\nHumans' decisions are not really completely explainable either... There's some limits to explanations, they're mostly rationalizations.\n\nYou take a cab and you trust the cab driver's brain to do the right thing, even if it's not explainable. If it were explainable, we could build convincing autonomous cars, which is not the case at the moment. So I think there are limits to explanations.\n\nsaid LeCun.\n\nMost of the time, it’s more about acceptability than explainability—an issue rooted in sociological aspects rather than purely technical ones,\n\nhe added.\n\nTheir dialogue shed light on the intricacies of navigating AI's 'black box' nature in healthcare, acknowledging the societal need for some level of rationale behind AI decisions while advocating for a robust evidence-based approach to validate their efficacy.\n\nTesting and clinical trials is really where the answer is... more than explainability,\n\nsaid LeCun.\n\nRegarding the Human vs AI debate, Dr Topol noted that\n\nStudy designs often pit machines against clinicians, but that's not the ideal setup. The optimal design is AI versus AI plus the physician.\n\nThe Dilemma: Accuracy vs. Explainability\n\nCentral to the conversation was the perennial challenge of prioritizing between accuracy and explainability in AI adoption across various industries. The scenario where demand for simpler, explainable models often supersedes more accurate yet intricate ones lingered as a pervasive dilemma.\n\nWhen asked about why people seem to care so much more about explainability in healthcare, Dr. Topol noted that\n\nImproving medical practices is a desirable goal. But the overriding goal remains the accuracy and efficacy of the model in benefiting patients. As AI progresses, we may wish to delve deeper into deconvoluting models to understand their saliency and other features better. However, that's not the primary agenda.\n\nIt’s all about experience. If everything were entirely explainable, you could become a doctor solely through books. But that's not the case; it's about the training and hands-on learning that shapes expertise,\n\nadded LeCun.\n\nThe experts highlighted the potential implications of this tug-of-war, underscoring the need to strike a delicate balance. This dilemma reflects the challenges faced in AI adoption and the pressing need for AI models that are both accurate and explainable in healthcare decision-making.\n\nThe Keyboard Liberation: Restoring Humanity in Medicine through AI\n\nA pivotal segment envisioned AI's role in rekindling the human touch in modern medicine. Both experts reminisced about a time when medicine thrived on intimate doctor-patient relationships. Dr. Topol evoked nostalgia for an era where the doctor-patient bond was characterized by empathy, trust, and genuine care.\n\nWe can restore the gift of time in medicine... and bring back that intimate relationship between doctor and patient,\n\nDr Topol noted.\n\nThe conversation underscored AI's potential as a liberator, freeing healthcare professionals from administrative burdens, streamlining tasks such as pre-authorizations, billing, or setting appointments, and allowing them to focus on the humanistic aspect of patient care. This vision of \"keyboard liberation\" emerged as the silver lining, intended to restore the essence of compassionate healthcare delivery.\n\nOur ability to utilize multimodal data—scans, voice, electronic records, and diverse data types—enables us to learn about an individual in depth to make sure they get the right medicine, the right treatment, the right prevention, the right everything,\n\nDr Topol added.\n\nLooking Ahead: AI's Promise in Healthcare\n\nAs the dialogue culminated, the focus shifted towards AI's promising prospects in healthcare, especially in drug discovery. Dr. Topol emphasized AI's potential to expedite drug discovery processes, citing missed opportunities where AI could have unveiled breakthroughs decades earlier.\n\nI think drug discovery is going to take off like never... with all the progress we've made in understanding the mechanism of life due to AI, we'll see many more breakthroughs.\n\nThe experts highlighted AI's ability to augment healthcare delivery while underscoring the need for humanistic values in medical practice. The synthesis of AI with medicine promises precision, efficiency, and a resurgence of the human touch in patient care, laying the groundwork for an era where AI serves as an ally in reshaping healthcare.\n\nThe discussion between Yann LeCun and Dr. Eric Topol showcased the complex interplay between AI and healthcare, highlighting the immense possibilities, hurdles, and ethical dilemmas in integrating AI into medicine, envisioning a future where AI serves as a catalyst for precision-driven yet human-centric healthcare delivery.",
      "# [No, you don’t necessarily need to see your patients in person to provide great care · Nabla](https://www.nabla.com/blog/asynchronous-care/)\nBack\n\nNo, you don ’t necessarily need to see your patients in person to provide great care\n\nAsynchronous care\n\nAsynchronous medicine describes care in which there is no continuous real-time interaction between the patient and the provider or between providers. Examples of asynchronous methods include video and audio recordings, the exchange of medical images, bio signal collection, emails, text messages and instant messaging. In essence, almost everything except physical or video visits.\n\nFrom crowded to optimized\n\nThe best way to describe the benefits of asynchronous medicine for a doctor is to compare a physical waiting room and a telemedicine platform.\n\nPicture a doctor's office: magazines scattered around, medical supplies somewhere, care sheets somewhere else, the medical assistant struggling to give an estimate of the waiting time to the patient who has been sitting around for 45min because you are held up with another patient. And here you are at your desk relentlessly filling an EHR so old you could auction it, double click after double click to prescribe paracetamol for the 15th time today. Your day goes by in 20min time slots, and each inevitable delay has an exponential impact on the next patient.\n\nEnters asynchronous care. Your time slots now vary according to patient care needs, your antique EHR has been replaced by a shiny new best friend filled with endless pre-built templates for care protocols, prescriptions, referrals, lab orders, health questionnaires to collect patients’ medical history prior to the encounter … Your patients no longer have to sit through delays in what can be an anxiety-inducing waiting room but are communicating with you from the comfort of their home. Those age-old magazines have been replaced with personalized, educational content.\n\nOf course, doctors cannot provide asynchronous care through their phone the way they would text a friend on WhatsApp. They need proper tools to make sure no patient information gets lost in the process. Digital health platforms such as Nabla must be built specifically to serve as a foolproof care manager, helping doctors keep track of patients, not simply now, but at all times, while complying with data privacy requirements.\n\nAsynchronous care improves communication between patients and doctors\n\nAsynchronous medicine is not intended to erase the human aspect of the patient-physician relationship. Actually, it is totally adapted and has a lot to bring to medical interactions. When a patient is sick - or anxious at the thought of being sick - and constrained by the inherent time limit of a encounter, having an orderly, clear conversation with their doctor can be difficult. Oral conversations - especially under stress and interspersed with medical terms - are not structured. Patients need time to articulate how and what they feel, and they also need time to process your answers and comments. A verbal chat is not necessarily adapted to such a context. This is especially true for intimate issues that one might feel uncomfortable talking about.\n\nAsynchronous care allows you to give structured sets of answers to patients’ concerns. One question equals one answer, no complaint goes unsolved and the patient keeps everything in writing. Who doesn’t have a family member who came home from a medical visit remembering only half of what the doctor said? Asynchronous care is a way for your patient to understand and remember every piece of information.\n\nAsynchronous care creates efficiency gains that translate into a more empathetic relationship\n\nBeyond the optimization of communications between patients and doctors, asynchronous care undeniably translates into efficiency gains. It allows for greater flexibility and better management of your time: you can answer a patient’s text in between two encounters, ​​simultaneously manage several patients with different health issues, and organize your workflow according to the degree of priority of each patient case. From voice memos to automated encounter reports and speech-to-text functionalities, asynchronous care features are designed to keep you fully focused on care. These efficiency gains allow you to lessen your administrative burden and to be able to focus your energy and whole attention on the reason why you became a doctor in the first place: caring for your patients.\n\nAsynchronous care makes it easy to follow up on patients, which is something “traditional” professionals are poorly incentivized to do as it would basically amount to opening Pandora’s box and not be compensated for it. Plus, getting a message saying, \"Hi Julie, I'm checking in. How are you feeling?\" makes for a delightful and empathetic patient experience. Your patients want to feel like you are thinking about them, and that you are caring for them, in every sense of the word.\n\nAsynchronous care promotes organic collaboration and holistic treatment plans\n\nAsynchronous care fosters collaboration between professionals. Patients do not always need an in-person visit but sometimes require a specialist to give specific insights on their condition. In this case, asynchronous care serves as a best practice. In a traditional setting, you would need to plan more in-person encounters for your patient - one with the specialist you are referring them to and one follow-up visit with you.\n\nIn an asynchronous setting, both you and the specialist have access to a patient’s medical information and may discuss with the patient in a unified thread, which is commonly known as tele-expertise. As such, asynchronous care allows for holistic care involving a patient’s entire care team in an organic manner. Even more so, technologies such as Nabla’s use machine learning to capture past messages from healthcare professionals in order to suggest the most relevant response to the professional currently working on a patient’s case. Inter-practitioner threads and exchanges are also a great way to share and get updated on topics outside your area of expertise.\n\nAsynchronous care is a great way to constantly increase your medical knowledge\n\nAsynchronous care allows you to have more time. More time to research, more time to reflect on complex or unfamiliar topics, to identify issues that persist in between encounters. More time to care. You can easily review the most up-to-date treatment strategy for a condition, then reply to the patient once you've made your inquiries. You do not need to improvise as the pressure to prevent bottlenecks and waiting room saturation escalates. You can give an informed and thoughtful response.\n\nOf course, it's never all sunshine and rainbows\n\nOf course, asynchronous care has its limits and is not intended to become the one and only way to provide care. These limits are mainly those of written communication. Difficulties in understanding the meaning of the text, response delays when the question is asked at night, difficulties in obtaining all the necessary information quickly so that the health professional can make treatment recommendations... Asynchronous chat is not adapted to the management of vital and psychiatric emergencies for instance. In some cases, naturally, the asynchronous approach is less relevant and personalized since there is no physical examination. On top of all this, asynchronous care depends on the healthcare professional's ability to be comfortable with digital tools.\n\nNevertheless, technology can help mitigate these potential drawbacks. The Nabla platform is pretty intuitive: no training is required to get the hang of it. Asynchronous communication is also a habit to develop and requires to adopt a neutral, empathetic and professional tone while explaining medical terms. The automatic correction, suggested answers, and filling in features on the platform alleviate these writing challenges. Asynchronous care must be paired with empathetic technology if it is to reach its full potential.\n\nTo sum it all up\n\nAsynchronous care changes the way we practice medicine, and for the better. Improved patient/doctor communication, efficiency and empathy gains, holistic treatment and collaboration between healthcare professionals…these are only some of the benefits I have observed while providing asynchronous care. All in all, asynchronous care is not intended to replace synchronous care, and it definitely has some limits. However, these limits can be mitigated by empathetic technology. It is meant as a powerful tool to complement in-person visits so that you as a doctor can provide better care, and become a better physician for your patients. So no, you do always need to see your patients in person to take great care of them.",

      "# Post ID 1b0befu: Best AI medical scribe tools? Do people use them? with +84 score by [(guiltless_inaccuracy, Reddit, 2024-02-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/)\nPhysician in a small clinic here. My practice has been looking into these new AI medical scribes to help with our clinical documentation. Everyone’s pretty burned out from spending so much time on patient notes, so this seems like a really interesting solution. Are these tools safe & legit?\n\nI wanted to try DeepScribe and DAX but it seems like you have to go through sales. A friend recommended NoteMD and I’ve been trying it out for a few days. So far it’s pretty good (it doesn’t save patient recordings which is great), but sometimes it doesn’t capture a sentence or two.\n\nWhat do people think about using these? Are they safe?\n\nEDIT: Thanks all for your comments, please stop spamming me in DMs :-) Our practice ended up with NoteMD which is working great.\n\n## Comment ID ks7b78p with +33 score by [(DrTestificate_MD, Reddit, 2024-02-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7b78p/) (in reply to ID 1b0befu):\nYes some people are using them. Permanente ran a pilot study making it available to 10000 docs and a significant percentage of them used it for over 100 encounters over a 4 week period. One doctor used it for over 1000 encounters in that time.\n\nThere are a ton available online now, some you can even use for free. Most likely they are just funneling the audio transcription to GPT4 with some special prompting to guide the process.\n\n### Comment ID ks7hk8p with +19 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-02-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7hk8p/) (in reply to ID ks7b78p):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID ks7ole5 with +10 score by [(lite_funky_one, Reddit, 2024-02-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7ole5/) (in reply to ID ks7hk8p):\nSome orthos see twice that in a day (if you were to believe everything you read on Reddit)\n\n#### Comment ID kseobwe with +1 score by [(Chawk121, Reddit, 2024-02-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/kseobwe/) (in reply to ID ks7hk8p):\nThe OBGYN I rotated with saw 80+ per day 4 days a week, not including our time in the OR/Hospital.\n\n#### Comment ID ks91upf with +1 score by [(DrTestificate_MD, Reddit, 2024-02-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks91upf/) (in reply to ID ks7hk8p):\nI’ll have to check the paper again, may have been 6 weeks\n\n### Comment ID ks7cgub with +2 score by [(b2q, Reddit, 2024-02-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7cgub/) (in reply to ID ks7b78p):\nWhich ones can you use for free?\n\n#### Comment ID ks7cvlz with +4 score by [(DrTestificate_MD, Reddit, 2024-02-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7cvlz/) (in reply to ID ks7cgub):\nI have seen Heidi is free.

Captures most of what is said and knows where to put it (History, exam, A/P, PI etc). Produces paragraphs of prose. For some reason it sucks at documenting my reasoning in an A/P — wordy, misses the if-then logic. Helps a little with allowing more eye contact with patient during visit but I gave up on it. Takes me 2 min to write my own primary care notes (after a little pre-charting.) When an AI model can read my previous notes and learn how I document and reproduce my style then I’ll use it.

I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers. Full HIPAA compliance and patient information is protected.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more!

Hope this helps.\n\n### Comment ID l6lflvl with +1 score by [(Jackyl_and_High, Reddit, 2024-06-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/l6lflvl/) (in reply to ID l121jyh):\nCost ?\n\n#### Comment ID lc95bao with +1 score by [(DCK1D, Reddit, 2024-07-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/lc95bao/) (in reply to ID l6lflvl):\nI can get you setup at [getwava.com](http://getwava.com) for free if you are interested. all I ask is for your feedback on the software so that I can improve it.\n\n### Comment ID l6o7c3v with +1 score by [(jrs9099, Reddit, 2024-06-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/l6o7c3v/) (in reply to ID l121jyh):\n~$2500 per fte per month.\n\n## Comment ID l4n9miw with +1 score by [(elietoubi, Reddit, 2024-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/l4n9miw/) (in reply to ID 1b0befu):\nHey,  \nA ton of people reached out to me on the reddit thread.\n\nI am the CEO of [scribeMD.ai](http://scribeMD.ai) ...

It gives you a gender neutral HPI (i.e. uses \"they/them\" pronouns) as well as mental status exam (I'm in psychiatry) and plan.  The MSE and plan are useless, at least for me. The HPI is decent.\n\nFreed doesn't show you a transcription live but you can access it afterwards. It gives a better HPI than Nabla and you can choose gender so it sounds better than using \"they/them\" all over. It also does a more honest job at the MSE; basically never attempts to write one and says \"not enough objective data.\" It also gives a plan and after visit summary. Both are really solid. Anything you say during the appointment in terms of plan, it'll capture. If I mention diet and exercise, it'll put in specifically what I said rather than just say \"lifestyle changes\". I have a template for plan that I prefer using so I don't actually use that part but I could easily see someone finding it useful (unlike Nabla where I don't think most people would find the generated plan sufficient). The after visit summary is gold though. Writes instructions as a letter from you to the patient, with an easy to read list of what was talked about during the appointment. \n\nIf they cut the price in half, I'd recommend Freed without any doubt. I wouldn't say it's worth a $100 a month though, especially since Nabla is free and the HPI is the main thing you want from an AI anyway, not plan or AVS.\n\n#### Comment ID k20c8mu with +12 score by [(blade24, Reddit, 2023-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k20c8mu/) (in reply to ID k1y3r77):\nWhat are the legal ramifications of these?

I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers. Full HIPAA compliance and patient information is protected.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more! You can also shoot me an email ernest.chan@getathelas.com and I'd be happy to chat more.\n\n## Comment ID k23jy34 with +1 score by [(toastycitrus, Reddit, 2023-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k23jy34/) (in reply to ID 16qm7ji):\nEdit\n\n### Comment ID ki1hlaw with +1 score by [(Emotional_Walrus_782, Reddit, 2024-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/ki1hlaw/) (in reply to ID k23jy34):\nCan actually do this with Heidi.

Downside is it's $400/mo  \n\n\nDAX/Nuance: Was not impressed. No free trial. You have to spend \\~$1200 for them to onboard you for a month then it's $700/mo after that ($600 + $100 for dragon).

I’ve been using Suki. It has direct access to my EMR and schedule so it’s as simple as clicking the patients name and starting the “note”. I access it through my phone and leave the phone near the patient and myself. It then processes the ramblings (I can be all over the place sometimes) of the visit and manages to organize it into HPI and a/p VERY accurately and in better detail than what I would normally do without it. It also does physical exam and other things like patient instructions but you’d need to speak out the physical exam which is weird. It has been life changing because it takes away the mental burden of documenting after seeing patients. I often do all my notes at lunch and then after the afternoon session because it allows me to stay on time and focus on the patient. Knowing all the details are being captured and all I need to do is organize the note a little is FANTASTIC. It requires so much less brain power than formulating the note and truly does it so well.\n\nCurrently offered by my practice but it’s 400 a month which is pricey.

These are the ones on my radar:\n\n- I have heard good things about Freed, but haven’t tried them. Their website doesn’t do a good job of showing off the potential, so I’m not sure why so many have tried it.\n- I have tried Nabla, and it seems great for the HPI section of a psychiatric intake, if you don’t mind it excluding some details. The problem is the option to add custom instructions isn’t very robust and prevents you from, say, adding a template and having the AI fill it out. It’s free to try out and easy to sign up.\n- I have heard people talk highly about Lindy AI, and it apparently can be used to automate more of your workflow than just note writing. Their CEO apparently has gotten in trouble for some shady things, but I’m very interested in trying them out.\n- Ambience Healthcare’s website had some sample transcriptions from their AI a few months ago, and I was very impressed. It’s on my radar to try soon\n- I wouldn’t recommend DeepScribe, as they historically marketed having your note ready only after several hours, which I believe is because they send the audio transcripts to employees for quality assurance, but maybe this has changed.\n- I wouldn’t recommend DeepCura. I didn’t like their UI and people have said they make it very difficult to cancel your subscription.\n- I wouldn’t recommend Amazon’s AWS Healthscribe since it’s very expensive compared to the competition.\n- Similarly, I suspect Nuance’s scribe is very expensive, as well.\n\nThere are other’s, like Suki ai, AutoScribe, iScribe, and more, but I have never heard anyone talk about these. I’m hoping r/Psychiatry can reach a consensus as to the clear favorite, but we’re not there yet. If I had to recommend some to try, I would go with the first four I mentioned.\n\n### Comment ID kt1kk1q with +5 score by [(Xvi_G, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1kk1q/) (in reply to ID kt1k11a):\nThank you\n\nI'm pretty sure it was your (this) specific response that I most wanted to revisit form the old post\n\n### Comment ID kt37dto with +2 score by [(pickyvegan, Reddit, 2024-03-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt37dto/) (in reply to ID kt1k11a):\nDeepScribe has changed- your note is ready almost immediately now.\n\n### Comment ID l0krb3x with +1 score by [(Proper_Parking_2461, Reddit, 2024-04-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/l0krb3x/) (in reply to ID kt1k11a):\nI’ve been using Twofold and its been really doing the job.

It costs me about 25 cents to do a progress note and 75 cents to do an evaluation.  I predict the costs to come down even more in the future.  Not having to type anymore during appointments - priceless.  I have arthritis in my hands so I could not stand the constant banging on the keyboard all day. It is also better because I can pay more attention to my patients and less to my keyboard.  I think my bill to Microsoft cognitive services (GPT-4 calls) is like $40-50/mo.\n\nIt also does after visit summaries for the patient. I also told it the APA criteria for CPT coding, so it helps me with that as well.\n\nMicrosoft does a BAA with everyone and says their implementation of GPT-4 is HIPAA compliant.  That being said, I don't put patients' last names into GPT-4, to keep the data somewhat deidentified.  I tried to get a BAA with OpenAI, who ignored all my messages, and I went down the rathole trying to encrypt all the PHI in the transcript, then decrypt the output.  Although it was a mistake, I did create a wonderful and effective LLM tool for automatically deidentifying and reidentifying healthcare information, though.\n\nIt works great, listens to all my patients appointments and churns out notes in the background while I work.  At the end of the day, there are my notes.  The quality of the notes is excellent. All must be proofread because the AI does occasionally make a mistake.\n\nI haven't had much luck getting it to diagnose patients or create treatment plans, not that I would trust it for such a thing, but I had some initial hopes for creating an \"AI colleague\", which were dashed.  It will scribe whatever I said to the patient during the appointment, but it doesn't seem to have any thinking or reasoning ability of its own. It is wonderful at organizing and summarizing information, though.\n\nI'm fulltime clinical, so it took me about 3 months of tinkering in my spare time to get something workable. I am a bit rusty, and had to get up to speed on all the new technology as well as teach myself Python.\n\nMy malpractice carrier advised me to get and document verbal approval from patients. After hearing about it, all except 1 said yes. She took some introductory LLM class and didn't seem to understand the technology very well, just enough to be scared of it.\n\nI have some colleagues who are working on a product called Berries ([berries.icu](https://berries.icu)). We have basically created the same sort of software independently, but they are productizing it and have it open beta right now.  The cost is reasonable and I saw a demo that seemed promising.\n\n### Comment ID ktez3qq with +1 score by [(radiostar1899, Reddit, 2024-03-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/ktez3qq/) (in reply to ID kt2y1rx):\nI also prefer to do a \"homebrew\" solution.

Berries is the best thing I've seen yet in the commercial space for psychiatrists.\n\nI have CAP/MPT. The rep I spoke to seemed well aware of AI technology and had an answer ready for me.  At the end of the day, the note is still my note, and I'm responsible for its contents the same as ever, regardless of what computer tools I used to help put it together for me.\n\nI use Microsoft Azure because they gave me a BAA and they also claim their GPT-4 implementation is HIPAA compliant. ChatGPT is not HIPAA compliant regardless of whether or not they use data for training - don't ever put your patient data into Chat GPT.  I also don't put patient last names, addresses, birthdays, phone numbers, or other nonessential PHI etc into GPT-4, in order to maintain patient privacy even more. There are no laws or even regulations about this technology, but I am satisfied with the patient privacy precautions I've taken.\n\nMy state is a 2 party consent state for recording of electronic communications, so I need to document consent for that. Not that I would record my patient interviews without their consent. I don't know that you specifically need consent to share PHI with a partner for whom you have a BAA, but I do also explain the LLM technology to my patients and get their consent for it.\n\nIt was impractical to scribe a psych eval until OpenAI came out with the gpt4-32k model. Most evals are 10000+ tokens and won't fit into the 8k window gpt4 had. You could sometimes use gpt-3.5 with the 16k window, but even that was too small sometimes, and the results were not as good. These days, we have gpt4-turbo, which has a 128k token window and can handle anything I throw at it, for much less $/token to boot.\n\n## Comment ID kt196a7 with +23 score by [(Xvi_G, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt196a7/) (in reply to ID 1b4uvub):\nFor my own experience, I've only just dipped a toe in the water. So far have used both MDHub and Nabla\n\nMDHub has an app that uses your phone mic, and keeps recording of your screen is off or of you switch out of the app. That's a small thing but it has a big impact on convenience of the recording. Particularly if you are working with a low talker.\n\nNabla seemed to have the slight edge in regards to the final formatting of the intake note, but I should note that I only used them utilizing their own standard formatting. I did not utilize any template other than just noting it as a new session and recording\n\nEither way, I found that for me (at this point) my best option was pasting THAT note to Chatgpt, uploading a word doc that has my tight intake format, and dictating some of my own observations that wouldn't have been transcribed from an intake note (MSE, general assessment and differential, some intangibles, etc)\n\nI also can tell chatgpt the tone I am seeking (clinical, narrative-driven, symptom focused, etc) and get a pretty good final product\n\nIt's a developing workflow that still needs  a lot of tweaking but it makes for a pretty solid final note. And while this would be too much effort for a med check, it's been a huge time saver and burnout protection for my 90 minute CAP intake evals\n\n### Comment ID kt1lrpb with +11 score by [(zpacksnackpack, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1lrpb/) (in reply to ID kt196a7):\nSounds like a great workflow! \n\nOne thing I’d note is Chat GPT is not HIPAA complaint (unless you have the super expensive enterprise version). \n\nBastion GPT is a great HIPAA compliant version you may want to check out it.\n\n#### Comment ID kt1q0ht with +9 score by [(Xvi_G, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1q0ht/) (in reply to ID kt1lrpb):\nThat's good to know about the alternate option\n\nFwiw I don't have any identifying info in my notes\n\nThat's all attached later via epic dot phrases\n\nBut certainly good to keep in mind\n\n## Comment ID kt1gj47 with +7 score by [(touchfuzzygetlit, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1gj47/) (in reply to ID 1b4uvub):\nI used FreedAI but it’s expensive like $100/month\n\n### Comment ID kt1o3nm with +2 score by [(DekkuRen, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1o3nm/) (in reply to ID kt1gj47):\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n#### Comment ID kt1qqzr with +9 score by [(colored_water, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1qqzr/) (in reply to ID kt1o3nm):\nI use freed and I love it.

At least the HPI written by an AI says something. I regularly see some extraordinarily shitty HPIs. I kid you not, the other day I was consulted on a patient and the HPI says, “Pt is a 70 yo with h/o HTN who presents due to AMS. Pt called 911 due to feeling unsafe at home.” No other information.\n\nIf any docs read this, do not consult someone if you write bullshit notes, don’t bother to call the consultant, and provide absolutely no explanation in the consult order. I have shit to do and I’m not digging through the chart to try to figure out what you want from me. I’m going to write a one-liner note that says, “Unclear reason for consult. No recommendations at this time. Reconsult if necessary and include consult question.” What I’m actually saying is, “You’re a lazy ass and bad at your job.”\n\nMy frustration with shit notes and shit consults is boiling over.\n\n## Comment ID jo6r77q with +4 score by [(spmurthy, Reddit, 2023-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/149akp5/anyone_have_any_experience_with_ai_scribe_software/jo6r77q/) (in reply to ID 149akp5):\nI am using it as dictation software .

Just the exhaustion in my eyes causes burnout and without having to stare at a computer all day - along with the emotional energy it takes, made the job really tough.”\n* ‘It’s one of the first times ever when a patient tells you a breakthrough or pivotal information where the knee jerk reaction isn’t to immediately look at the computer and document that. Everything is so much more fresh and the notes are much more specific in regard to each session which really allows for the authenticity of what’s happening in the sessions to be captured.’\n\nWhether from a clinical or business perspective, the goal is to make documentation more efficient so that you can see more patients and increase top line revenue.\n\n[**Schedule some time or reach out at ernest.chan@getathelas.com**](https://hello.athelas.com/c/ernest_chan#/select-time)\n\n*-* [*Athelas Scribe Testimonial Video*](https://hello.athelas.com/api/mailings/click/PMRGSZBCHIZTSNRRGQZSYITVOJWCEORCNB2HI4DTHIXS65TJNVSW6LTDN5WS6OBYG4YDGMJWHEYSELBCN5ZGOIR2EIZWKZTCGYYTIMZNGFSDCOJNGRRTKMJNMIYGKNBNMY4WCZBZHA2DOMTCMJSCELBCOZSXE43JN5XCEORCGQRCYITTNFTSEORCIMWVQVDLI54TC4DGIVMUIMLUHFCXUVCYNZEEKRBZMRVTE4RQJZJEGUKSOREEE22PLA2GOPJCPU======)\n\n*-* [*Athelas Scribe Demo*](https://hello.athelas.com/api/mailings/click/PMRGSZBCHIZTSNRRGQZSYITVOJWCEORCNB2HI4DTHIXS65TJNVSW6LTDN5WS6OJUGIYTIMBVGQ4SELBCN5ZGOIR2EIZWKZTCGYYTIMZNGFSDCOJNGRRTKMJNMIYGKNBNMY4WCZBZHA2DOMTCMJSCELBCOZSXE43JN5XCEORCGQRCYITTNFTSEORCKBXVATTIK5DGORCZK54HSYKLMRQVC5K7JVLXS4JWIMZUGRKKGRHUKQ2DPJZWEWKYJZTGOPJCPU======)\n\n*-* [*Athelas EHR Integration with Scribe*](https://hello.athelas.com/api/mailings/click/PMRGSZBCHIZTSNRRGQZSYITVOJWCEORCNB2HI4DTHIXS65TJNVSW6LTDN5WS6OJUGIYTINRVGUYSELBCN5ZGOIR2EIZWKZTCGYYTIMZNGFSDCOJNGRRTKMJNMIYGKNBNMY4WCZBZHA2DOMTCMJSCELBCOZSXE43JN5XCEORCGQRCYITTNFTSEORCMRCXIMZXGNYWUZCNKBRGKQ2WGJLFGVKUJBJUKMDQIVYXEZBSIZKXIUDKMR4S2WTROZ2EKPJCPU======)\n\n*-* [*Athelas Intake Features Demo*](https://hello.athelas.com/api/mailings/click/PMRGSZBCHIZTSNRRGQZSYITVOJWCEORCNB2HI4DTHIXS653XO4XGY33PNUXGG33NF5ZWQYLSMUXTQNTBMMYTOMDGGUYWENBUGIYDQOBXHAYTAMZZGNSTGNLDGVRGKNJ7ONUWIPJRGVQWEYJVMQZS2NBYGRSS2NBWG44S2YRYMM3S2OBXGA3TONRZMY4DSZBVEIWCE33SM4RDUIRTMVTGENRRGQZS2MLEGE4S2NDDGUYS2YRQMU2C2ZRZMFSDSOBUG4ZGEYTEEIWCE5TFOJZWS33OEI5CENBCFQRHG2LHEI5CEU2VGRJW6QRYIJAUCQJRJYZHMRDYNRRWE6SFIM4DIYJWJ5WWUQLTONQTEWKZFUWVIMK7JU6SE7I=)\n\n*-* [*Customized Formatting Demo*](https://hello.athelas.com/api/mailings/click/PMRGSZBCHIZTSNRRGQZSYITVOJWCEORCNB2HI4DTHIXS653XO4XGY33PNUXGG33NF5ZWQYLSMUXTKMBWGIZDKMJZMQ2TINJUMNRDEYTFGAZDEOJYGU2DAMZTGQ4WKNZCFQRG64THEI5CEM3FMZRDMMJUGMWTCZBRHEWTIYZVGEWWEMDFGQWWMOLBMQ4TQNBXGJRGEZBCFQRHMZLSONUW63RCHIRDIIRMEJZWSZZCHIRHCURQIRXWE2TGGZFVQY2PNZWUS4DGN5HUWRKTKNDXCNLJGRHUESBVKNEEGULQJBKWQUKFHURH2===)\n\n## Comment ID lblehyi with +1 score by [(BubblySass143, Reddit, 2024-07-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1dsa1e1/does_anyone_have_any_experience_with_ai_scribes/lblehyi/) (in reply to ID 1dsa1e1):\nI’ve used DAX since 2022.

It's very, very glowy, which isn't necessarily flattering if you're oily skinned or have the other things going on that I mentioned. It isn't sparkly, but I often use it as a highlight. However, if you want a full coverage I've heard amazing things about their newest addition, the Soft Glam Satin Foundation. \n\n\nMaybelline's foundations are solid choices for the price range, Fit Me Matte & Poreless is a classic and for gold reason, and their skin tint also gets fabulous reviews.\n\n## Comment ID ljs9reu with +5 score by [(OkCartoonist3430, Reddit, 2024-08-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ulta/comments/1f0ffxd/tell_me_what_you_need_and_ill_try_to_help/ljs9reu/) (in reply to ID 1f0ffxd):\nI have frizzy long waivy hair what products could I use so my blowout can last more than a few hours ?\n\n### Comment ID ljsqpda with +6 score by [(Calm-Home674, Reddit, 2024-08-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ulta/comments/1f0ffxd/tell_me_what_you_need_and_ill_try_to_help/ljsqpda/) (in reply to ID ljs9reu):\nThe Shea moisture mousse is amazing.

I really appreciate it. \nMy current skincare routine in the AM : \n- bubble niacinamide & vit C serum \n-corsx peptide booster serum \n-the ordinary barrier restore serum \n-corsx snail mucin\n-elemis marine collagen cream \n-corsx snail mucin cream \n-byoma barrier restore cream \n-it cosmetics spf serum \nSkincare routine in the PM: \n-vt reedle shot 100 \n-vt pdrn serum \n-Provence immortal night milk \n1. Am I doing too much? Sometimes I feel like I have damaged my skin barrier because my bare skin without any skincare on, looks terrible. It's peeling in a few places and I'm worried.\n2. What skincare or makeup products can be used to reduce a textured look on my t-zone? My nose and forehead really need help. \n3. I'm a 29yr old, what is the one product I must include in my skincare or makeup regardless of how expensive it is? Something that I should keep stocking up.\n\n### Comment ID ljswijl with +3 score by [(Calm-Home674, Reddit, 2024-08-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ulta/comments/1f0ffxd/tell_me_what_you_need_and_ill_try_to_help/ljswijl/) (in reply to ID ljscf0n):\nI don’t think youd need multiple barrier restore products. It could be damaging your skin. \n\nI would change your routine into...            \n\n1. bubble niacinamide & vit C serum \n2. corsx peptide booster serum\n3. elemis marine collagen cream \n4. corsx snail mucin cream\n5. byoma barrier restore cream\n6. it cosmetics spf serum\n\nI’d keep your night routine the same. Maybe add the moisturizer I mention below or another type of moisturizing cream \n\n3.  for your T zone I recommend the strivictin acne line. I do this after I get out the shower followed by a moisturizer because it is drying.  It works WONDERS!! \n\n4. My personal favorite for my routine that I buy regardless of price is the peach and Lily ultra plush moisturizer. It’s a God send. In general your favorite cleanser and a deep moisturerizer are a must for everyone to have. \n\nAlso. Give yourself 30 days of consistenty before deciding if it's for you or not. It can take a few weeks before our skin/bodies get used to the change. \n\nGoodluck!! ♥️🥰\n\n#### Comment ID ljszzi4 with +1 score by [(alohamora795, Reddit, 2024-08-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ulta/comments/1f0ffxd/tell_me_what_you_need_and_ill_try_to_help/ljszzi4/) (in reply to ID ljswijl):\nThank you so much! 🥰💕\n\n## Comment ID ljsezqf with +1 score by [(lo530, Reddit, 2024-08-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ulta/comments/1f0ffxd/tell_me_what_you_need_and_ill_try_to_help/ljsezqf/) (in reply to ID 1f0ffxd):\nHi any recommendations for long,dehydrated,and frizzy wavy hair that is prone to buildup.

I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers. Full HIPAA compliance and patient information is protected.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more! You can also shoot me an email ernest.chan@getathelas.com and I'd be happy to chat more.\n\n## Comment ID kw8cvoa with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pediatrics/comments/196hyb4/seeking_info_about_ai_scribes/kw8cvoa/) (in reply to ID 196hyb4):\nTry infoseek.ai - $12/mo for 10 hours.

The only thing you mentioned that could be long enough to need to retrieve from is the patient’s full medical records. But if your goal is to generate personalized treatments plans, etc. then you’re probably going to need to consolidate that information so the LLM can understand it holistically, rather than just retrieve from it.\n\nI’d start by thinking through what all your prompts should look like, and what information the LLM is going to need to have access to for each of them. If you find a step in the process where that key information can’t all fit into the prompt, then you can consider RAG solutions. At that point you’ll have a much clearer idea of what the RAG problem looks like, and in turn what the solution will need to look like.\n\n## Comment ID ldt3rl5 with +4 score by [(muditjps, Reddit, 2024-07-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1e6bic0/how_can_i_create_medical_rag_chatbot/ldt3rl5/) (in reply to ID 1e6bic0):\nI tried LLMs for a use-case around biotech research. Based on that I strongly feel that LLMs currently lack the ability to properly comprehend nuanced medical contexts. And, I'm not even talking about RAG. Besides, medical knowledge evolves and LLMs are still a blackbox to be trusted for crucial aspects such as treatment plans. \n\nThink it this way, would you make financial investments purely based on an LLM. \n\nSo first off I think ideation can be refined. In my opinion, it's better if this implemented for specific aspects. For example, there's a Paris based startup (Nabla) that automates writing of clinical notes. \n\nHowever, should you still look at technical aspects of this: \n\n1. **For RAG pipeline:** pick something that is easy to use with incremental updates. i.e. you're not dealing with a static data source but one which needs an evolving data source. Pathway is an open source option for it. [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pathwaycom/llm-app).   \n  \n2. **For improving accuracy**: Yes, you'll need something like Hybrid Indexes or at least metadata based filtering to retrieve better results. Accuracy is paramount in these cases. Most frameworks can do the job. Here are a couple of resources that I find useful:\n\n* [Metadata filtering + Vector search example](https://github.com/pathwaycom/llm-app/tree/main/examples/pipelines/slides_ai_search)\n* [Keyword + Vector search example with BM25 (quite a short video)](https://youtu.be/lYxGYXjfrNI)\n* I also checked and liked the resource shared by u/thanghaimeow!\n\n### Comment ID ldt5tyu with +3 score by [(FigureClassic6675, Reddit, 2024-07-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1e6bic0/how_can_i_create_medical_rag_chatbot/ldt5tyu/) (in reply to ID ldt3rl5):\nThank you for this brief explanation.\n\n### Comment ID ldvyp5d with +1 score by [(dontpushbutpull, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1e6bic0/how_can_i_create_medical_rag_chatbot/ldvyp5d/) (in reply to ID ldt3rl5):\nTo illustrate the point a bit more:\n\nSome time ago i wrote a lengthy technical onboarding material.

      "# [Nabla Now Supports 35 Languages to Advance Culturally Responsive Care on 2024-09-05](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nabla-now-supports-35-languages-to-advance-culturally-responsive-care-302239179.html)\nNabla expands languages captured by its ambient AI assistant to produce culturally responsive clinical notes and instructions to streamline workflows and enhance the patient/provider experience\n\nMedical errors due to language barriers cost the U.S. health system an estimated $60 to $80 billion annually\n\nIneffective physician-patient communication can impact patient compliance, experiences, and health outcomes\n\nBOSTON, Sept 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nabla, the leading ambient AI assistant for clinicians, today announced the launch of 31 new languages. Nabla expanded its AI-powered clinical documentation to support additional languages beyond the existing English (US), English (UK), French, and Spanish. The enhancement aims to assist a broader range of physicians who care for patients in various languages, including regional dialects and variations. By introducing these new language options, Nabla hopes to help bridge the language barrier for the 66 million people who do not speak English as their primary language. Nabla now supports 35 international languages.\n\nExam room language barriers negatively impact the patient-physician relationship, causing confusion, distrust in physicians, a low rate of patient compliance, and poor health outcomes. At the same time, physicians who provide care in multiple languages require expanded access to AI-powered documentation tools that lead to greater efficiency and overall improved patient outcomes. Ineffective communication also has financial implications, where medical errors related to language barriers cost health systems up to $80 billion annually nationwide.\n\n\"Supporting physicians with AI assistants like ours that enhance clinical documentation regardless of the language spoken bridges a gap in care delivery and drives forward health equity initiatives,\" said Delphine Groll, co-founder and COO, Nabla. \"By expanding the languages Nabla captures, we're advancing care delivery by allowing providers to remain focused on building rapport and trust with the patient and improving the patient experience by generating clear, concise language-specific details and instructions.\"\n\nIn July 2023, Nabla was the first ambient AI assistant to launch a Spanish-language version to support physician-patient conversations. California-based health systems, including Children's Hospital Los Angeles, quickly adopted the Spanish-language version, which is used in 8% of the visits conducted with Nabla. Nabla listened closely to its customers and prospects when determining which new language versions to create. For example, prospects and clients based on the West Coast frequently requested Chinese language support to improve communications with their patient population that speaks Chinese languages. All new language versions account for the top languages spoken in the U.S.\n\nNabla's generative AI ambiently produces real-time comprehensive clinical notes in the background during physician-patient conversations. The platform also has multi-speaker functionality to ensure guardians and parents are captured when present during the exam. Switching to a different language within Nabla is simple; the provider chooses the specific language before the start of a consultation, and Nabla uses its powerful ambient AI to create detailed clinical notes in English and patient instructions in the selected language. Providing patient instructions in their preferred language improves patient engagement and treatment adherence, increases trust in the healthcare industry, and ultimately better patient health outcomes.\n\nAbout Nabla\n\nNabla is the leading ambient AI assistant, reducing practitioner stress and improving patient care. Nabla produces AI-generated clinical notes in seconds from any encounter across all specialties. Powered by proprietary LLMs, fine-tuned to the medical field, Nabla's capabilities include AI-enabled medical coding identification and smooth EHR integrations.\n\nThe company's leadership includes: Alex Lebrun (CEO), with over two decades of experience building AI products, and whose companies have been acquired by Nuance (VirtuOz) and Facebook (Wit.ai); Delphine Groll (COO) and Martin Raison (CTO). Ed Lee, MD, MPH, who was previously CIO at The Permanente Federation, recently joined Nabla as Chief Medical Officer. He heads Nabla's Clinical Advisory Board, formed by 20+ seasoned clinical leaders.\n\nOn the technological side, the company's advisors include Yann LeCun, VP & Chief AI Scientist at Meta, and Tony Fadell, inventor of the iPod and former Apple executive, among others.\n\nNabla has raised a total of $49M, its most recent fundraising being a $30M series B led by global venture capital firm Cathay Innovation.

      "# [Generative AI in the EHR: Powering NextGen® Ambient Assist & restoring clinician well](https://www.nabla.com/blog/gen-ai-ehr/)\nBack\n\nGenerative AI in the EHR: Powering NextGen® Ambient Assist & restoring clinician well-being\n\nJune 5, 2024·7 minute read\n\nBack in November Nabla announced an exciting integration with NextGen Healthcare, a leading provider of innovative, cloud-based healthcare solutions to power NextGen® Ambient Assist. NextGen Ambient Assist is a fully automated ambient listening solution that delivers clinical notes directly to NextGen Healthcare's electronic health record (EHR) platforms, significantly reducing clinical documentation time.\n\nNextGen Healthcare was one of the pioneers in embracing Generative AI, recognizing its potential to mitigate physician burnout and enhance the overall patient experience.\n\nGenerative AI in the EHR\n\nWhile widespread adoption of EHRs has undeniably improved care coordination, enhanced data accessibility, and streamlined diagnosis, it is also contributing to documentation fatigue and clinician burnout. According to a 2021 study from JAMIA, for every eight hours that office-based physicians have scheduled with patients, they spend more than five hours in the EHR. When it comes to clinical documentation, a study found that writing and reviewing notes takes up 78% of all physician interactions with EHRs. Challenges include data entry, interoperability, cluttered visual display, and diverting attention from patient care among others.\n\nThe emergence of Generative AI presents a myriad of opportunities to streamline various stages of the clinical workflow, spanning from clinical documentation and coding to clinical decision support and patient communication.\n\nNextGen Ambient Assist, powered by Nabla\n\nNabla has been integrated with NextGen Ambient Assist since October 2023, and is already available to nearly 5,000 users of the NextGen Mobile application. NextGen Ambient Assist uses the audio from patient encounters to automatically capture subjective, objective, assessment, and plan (SOAP) notes that help organize providers' observations. These notes are automatically presented in NextGen Mobile for provider review and editing before inclusion in the patient's EHR chart. NextGen Ambient Assist has been shown to save providers an average of 1.5 to 2 hours of documentation per day.\n\nIn an effort to address the national shortage of mental and behavioral health professionals, the company also recently announced it was making NextGen Ambient Assist available to psychiatrists and other practitioners in the behavioral health space.\n\nAs Nabla and NextGen Healthcare continue to work together to expand ambient AI capabilities in the EHR, we interviewed Jeremy Dixon, Vice President of Product Development at NextGen Healthcare to gain insights into the company’s perspective on our partnership.\n\nLet’s chat!\n\nKenza: What challenges and industry trends led NextGen Healthcare to seek out an integration with Nabla?\n\nJeremy: NextGen is committed to materially enhancing the care provider experience and are continuously evaluating opportunities to improve EHR usability and effectiveness. Several of our clients requested to prioritize addressing the documentation burden that weighs heavily on their providers, compelling them to devote extra hours at the clinic or stay up late completing documentation from the previous day. Besides being time consuming, existing live scribing and virtual scribing alternatives are also expensive and adversely impact providers’ ability to be more present with the patient during the encounter. We recognized the potential of AI to comprehensively address these challenges and sought out partners who were developing solutions in this space.\n\nKenza: Why was this a priority?\n\nJeremy: Timely access to care providers continues to be a significant challenge in the industry, even as physician shortages and clinician burnout are impacting the supply side of the equation. We prioritized this concern since it has the potential to not only significantly alleviate the documentation burden for providers directly, but to also unlock incremental clinical capacity which is advantageous to both patients and the financial sustainability of the practices we serve.\n\nKenza: What was NextGen Healthcare looking for in an ambient AI solution for clinical documentation?\n\nJeremy: We were looking for a partner that was collaborative in nature, with a track record of proven technology capable of addressing the problem in real-time through a fully tech-based solution. Further, we wanted to work with a partner who appreciates the many ethical and security concerns associated with AI usage in the care journey and had the appropriate controls and measures in place to ensure a safe and defensible care experience for our clients and patient communities.\n\nKenza: How did you find out about Nabla, and why did you choose to partner with us?\n\nJeremy: We found Nabla during our discovery work when vetting various ambient vendors. Nabla’s vision aligned with our mission to reduce provider documentation time and cognitive load while also meeting stringent standards for security and governance. Nabla’s technology stack is modern and extensible, and the engineering and product teams proved to be agile and highly responsive to our client’s evolving needs.\n\nKenza: What made our solution stand out over others that you researched?\n\nJeremy: The strength of the technical stack (API first), the alignment of mission and vision to make a positive impact with healthcare providers, and the overall leadership of the executive team at Nabla. Additionally, the speed at which the product continuously improves reflects a refreshing emphasis on clients’ needs and results-oriented growth model.\n\nKenza: What have you been most impressed with?\n\nJeremy: There are many areas that impressed us, but the one that stands out is Nabla’s commitment to understanding the problem space and willingness to engage our end customers to cultivate a deep understanding of their needs and requirements. The technology is capable of standing on its own merits but what differentiates this offering is its customer-centricity.\n\nKenza: What surprised you the most from working with the Nabla team? What’s it like working with us?\n\nJeremy: What stands out most is the exceptional collaboration we've experienced while working with Nabla. The strong focus on user feedback is evident in both the way the team swiftly resolves our clients’ queries, as well as their ability to integrate new innovations into the product rapidly and meet the evolving needs of clients.\n\nKenza: What kind of feedback have you heard from your clients using NextGen Ambient Assist?\n\nJeremy: Overall, our clients love it. They call it a “game-changing” solution. They say that it allows them to focus on the patient and saves them a lot of time on the backend. Since it is fully integrated within our EHR platform, many of our users have reported they no longer have to take “work” home and are enjoying a better work/life balance. One of our provider clients shared that a typical encounter plus documentation time can take under 10 minutes, so he was able to add five new patients a day. He also noted that it saves their practice money since it costs a lot less than having a virtual or live scribe.\n\nKenza: How has NextGen Ambient Assist benefited your company and business as a whole?\n\nJeremy: It has allowed us to take a significant step forward in how we support our clients as trusted partners. By re-imagining the provider experience and solving a real-world problem for our providers that positively impacts their experience while also enhancing care quality, access and practice sustainability we continue to live our vision of delivering better healthcare outcomes for all.\n\nKenza: How do you envision our partnership moving forward?\n\nJeremy: While the early returns from our partnership have been tremendous, we are focused on scaling the impact we believe we can deliver across our complete customer base. Further, we are taking the lessons from the real-world deployment of this AI solution into the EHR (i.e., reimagining clinical workflows, physician change management and training, adoption patterns etc.) to shape the next evolution of AI capabilities that will positively impact the provider and patient experience.\n\n–\n\nNabla offers multiple integration options, including a deep white label integration through API that allows EHRs to stay on brand.",
      "# [Nabla raises another $24 million for its AI assistant for doctors that automatically writes clinical notes by Romain Dillet on 2024-01-05](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/05/nabla-raises-another-24-million-for-its-ai-assistant-for-doctors/)\nParis-based startup Nabla just announced that it has raised a $24 million Series B funding round led by Cathay Innovation, with participation from ZEBOX Ventures — the corporate VC fund of CMA CGM. This funding round comes just a few months after Nabla signed a large-scale partnership with Permanente Medical Group, a division of U.S. healthcare giant Kaiser Permanente.\n\nAccording to a source, Nabla has reached a valuation of $180 million following today’s funding round. The company could also end up raising more money from U.S. investors as part of this round.\n\nNabla has been working on an AI copilot for doctors and other medical staff. The best way to describe it is that it’s a silent work partner that sits in the corner of the room, takes notes and writes medical reports for you.\n\nThe startup was originally founded by Alexandre Lebrun, Delphine Groll and Martin Raison. Lebrun, Nabla’s CEO, was the CEO of Wit.ai, an AI assistant startup that was acquired by Facebook. He then became the head of engineering of Facebook’s AI research lab FAIR.\n\nA few weeks ago, I saw a live demo of Nabla with a real doctor and a fake patient pretending that they had back pains. When a physician starts a consultation, they hit the start button in Nabla’s interface and forget about their computer.\n\nIn addition to the physical examination part, a consultation also includes a long discussion with a bunch of questions about what brings you here and your medical history. At the end of the consultation, there might also be recommendations and prescriptions.\n\nNabla uses speech-to-text technology to turn the conversation into a written transcript. It works with both in-person consultations and telehealth appointments.\n\nAfter the patient has left, the doctor hits the stop button. Nabla then uses a large language model refined with medical data and health-related conversations to identify the important data points in the consultation — medical vitals, drug names, pathologies, etc.\n\nNabla generates a thorough medical report in a minute or two with a summary of the consultation, prescriptions and follow-up appointment letters.\n\nThese reports can be customized to the doctor’s needs with a personalized format for your notes. For instance, you can add instructions to make the note more concise or more verbose. Or you can ask to generate notes that follow the Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) note pattern that is widely used in the U.S.\n\nDuring the demo that I saw, I was extremely surprised by the effectiveness of Nabla in general. Even though we were in a crowded room and Nabla was running on a laptop a couple of meters away from the demo presenters, the tool was able to generate an accurate transcript and a useful report.\n\nWith Nabla Copilot, as the name suggests, the startup isn’t trying to take the human out of the medical loop. Physicians still have a final say as they can edit reports before they are filed in their electronic health record system (EHR).\n\nInstead, the company thinks it can help doctors save time on admin work so that they can spend more time focusing on patients.\n\n“What we know is the near future is we don’t want to try to replace doctors. You’ve seen companies — like Babylon in the U.K. — burning $1 billion trying to do chatbots and trying to automate things right away and remove doctors from the loop. And we’ve decided a long time ago with Nabla Copilot that [doctors] are the pilots and we work by their side,” Lebrun said.\n\n“It’s a little bit like automation for autonomous vehicles. We are still at level two today. We will start level three very soon with clinical assurance support. Then level four is clinical decision support, but with FDA approval, because you make decisions that you cannot really explain,” he added.\n\nAt some point, you could even imagine a level five of autonomous healthcare, which would mean removing physicians from the room. But Lebrun is still very cautious on this front.\n\n“For some situations in some markets, like in some countries where they don’t have any access to healthcare, it would be a relevant thing,” he said. Over the long term, he sees the diagnostic process as a “pattern matching problem” that could be solved with AI. Doctors would focus on empathy, surgery procedures and critical decisions.\n\nWhile Nabla is based in France, most of the company’s customers are in the U.S. following a rollout across Permanente Medical Group. Nabla isn’t just a work in progress, it is actively used every day by thousands of doctors.\n\nNabla’s privacy model\n\nNabla is currently available as a web app or a Google Chrome extension. The company is well aware that it is handling sensitive data. That’s why it doesn’t store audio or medical notes on its servers, unless both the doctor and the patient give their consent.\n\nNabla focuses on data processing instead of data storing. After a consultation, the audio file is discarded and the transcript is stored in the EHR that doctors are already using for their patient files.\n\nIn more technical terms, when a physician starts a recording, the audio is transcribed in real time using a fine-tuned speech-to-text API. The company uses a combination of an off-the-shelf speech-to-text API from Microsoft Azure and its own speech-to-text model (a refined model based on the open source Whisper model).\n\n“When you have just a normal speech-to-text algorithm, they may or may not be good on medical data. But we have a fine-tuned one. And, as you probably have seen, the text is very light at first, and then it becomes dark. And when it becomes dark, it means that we verified it with our own model and we corrected it with medication names or medical conditions,” Nabla ML engineer Grégoire Retourné said during the demo that I saw.\n\nThe transcript is first pseudonymized, meaning that personally identifiable information is replaced with variables. Pseudonymized transcripts are processed by a large language model. Historically, Nabla has been using GPT-3 and then GPT-4 as its main large language model. As an enterprise customer, Nabla can tell OpenAI that it can’t store its data and train its large language model on those consultations.\n\nBut Nabla has also been playing with a fine-tuned version of Llama 2. “In the future, we envision using more and more narrow models as opposed to general models,” Lebrun said.\n\nOnce the LLM has processed the transcript, Nabla de-pseudonymizes the output. Doctors can see the note, which is stored on the computer in the local web browser storage file. Notes can be exported to EHRs.\n\nHowever, doctors can give their approval and ask for the patient consent to share medical notes with Nabla so that they can be used to correct transcription errors. And given that Nabla is on track to process more than 3 million consultations per year in three languages, chances are Nabla will improve really quickly thanks to real-world data.",

Dr. Lovinger advises clinical leaders to ensure the solution they choose can align seamlessly with their health system’s workflows.\n\nCarle Health chose Nabla after testing many ambient voice products; Dr. Lovinger says they are “not all created equal.” Carle Health found reaction from its clinicians to be “uniformly positive” after a four-week pilot.\n\nNot only did Nabla meet their requirements for quality and ease of use, but the company was great to work with. A team at Nabla is dedicated to training and onboarding for every roll-out. Dr. Lovinger says that unlike some vendors, Nabla is excited to hear users’ suggestions and work on new features that adapt to their needs.\n\nDr. Lovinger likes many of the features of Nabla: It reminds the doctor of things that they should advise the patient, and the AI can record more detail than the clinician remembers.\n\nNabla also “works hard” at integration with the EHR, according to Dr. Lee, who considers integration to be near or at the top of customer requirements. With a single click, a generated SOAP note goes into the Epic EHR. In addition, they can update the problem list with new diagnoses. In the future, they plan to work directly with other parts of the EHR, such as medication orders, family history, and social history.\n\nThey also want to move into automatic coding and clinical decision support.

      "# [Researchers say an AI-powered transcription tool used in hospitals invents things no one ever said by GARANCE BURKE, HILKE SCHELLMANN, apnews.com, garance-burke on 2024-10-26](https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-health-business-90020cdf5fa16c79ca2e5b6c4c9bbb14)\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Tech behemoth OpenAI has touted its artificial intelligence-powered transcription tool Whisper as having near “human level robustness and accuracy.”\n\nBut Whisper has a major flaw: It is prone to making up chunks of text or even entire sentences, according to interviews with more than a dozen software engineers, developers and academic researchers. Those experts said some of the invented text — known in the industry as hallucinations — can include racial commentary, violent rhetoric and even imagined medical treatments.\n\nExperts said that such fabrications are problematic because Whisper is being used in a slew of industries worldwide to translate and transcribe interviews, generate text in popular consumer technologies and create subtitles for videos.\n\nMore concerning, they said, is a rush by medical centers to utilize Whisper-based tools to transcribe patients’ consultations with doctors, despite OpenAI’ s warnings that the tool should not be used in “high-risk domains.”\n\nThe full extent of the problem is difficult to discern, but researchers and engineers said they frequently have come across Whisper’s hallucinations in their work. A University of Michigan researcher conducting a study of public meetings, for example, said he found hallucinations in eight out of every 10 audio transcriptions he inspected, before he started trying to improve the model.\n\nA machine learning engineer said he initially discovered hallucinations in about half of the over 100 hours of Whisper transcriptions he analyzed. A third developer said he found hallucinations in nearly every one of the 26,000 transcripts he created with Whisper.\n\nThe problems persist even in well-recorded, short audio samples. A recent study by computer scientists uncovered 187 hallucinations in more than 13,000 clear audio snippets they examined.\n\nThat trend would lead to tens of thousands of faulty transcriptions over millions of recordings, researchers said.\n\n___\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center’s AI Accountability Network, which also partially supported the academic Whisper study. AP also receives financial assistance from the Omidyar Network to support coverage of artificial intelligence and its impact on society.\n\n___\n\nSuch mistakes could have “really grave consequences,” particularly in hospital settings, said Alondra Nelson, who led the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy for the Biden administration until last year.\n\n“Nobody wants a misdiagnosis,” said Nelson, a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. “There should be a higher bar.”\n\nWhisper also is used to create closed captioning for the Deaf and hard of hearing — a population at particular risk for faulty transcriptions. That’s because the Deaf and hard of hearing have no way of identifying fabrications “hidden amongst all this other text,” said Christian Vogler, who is deaf and directs Gallaudet University’s Technology Access Program.\n\nOpenAI urged to address problem\n\nThe prevalence of such hallucinations has led experts, advocates and former OpenAI employees to call for the federal government to consider AI regulations. At minimum, they said, OpenAI needs to address the flaw.\n\n“This seems solvable if the company is willing to prioritize it,” said William Saunders, a San Francisco-based research engineer who quit OpenAI in February over concerns with the company’s direction. “It’s problematic if you put this out there and people are overconfident about what it can do and integrate it into all these other systems.”\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the company continually studies how to reduce hallucinations and appreciated the researchers’ findings, adding that OpenAI incorporates feedback in model updates.\n\nWhile most developers assume that transcription tools misspell words or make other errors, engineers and researchers said they had never seen another AI-powered transcription tool hallucinate as much as Whisper.\n\nWhisper hallucinations\n\nThe tool is integrated into some versions of OpenAI’s flagship chatbot ChatGPT, and is a built-in offering in Oracle and Microsoft’s cloud computing platforms, which service thousands of companies worldwide. It is also used to transcribe and translate text into multiple languages.\n\nIn the last month alone, one recent version of Whisper was downloaded over 4.2 million times from open-source AI platform HuggingFace. Sanchit Gandhi, a machine-learning engineer there, said Whisper is the most popular open-source speech recognition model and is built into everything from call centers to voice assistants.\n\nProfessors Allison Koenecke of Cornell University and Mona Sloane of the University of Virginia examined thousands of short snippets they obtained from TalkBank, a research repository hosted at Carnegie Mellon University. They determined that nearly 40% of the hallucinations were harmful or concerning because the speaker could be misinterpreted or misrepresented.\n\nIn an example they uncovered, a speaker said, “He, the boy, was going to, I’m not sure exactly, take the umbrella.”\n\nBut the transcription software added: “He took a big piece of a cross, a teeny, small piece ... I’m sure he didn’t have a terror knife so he killed a number of people.”\n\nA speaker in another recording described “two other girls and one lady.” Whisper invented extra commentary on race, adding “two other girls and one lady, um, which were Black.”\n\nIn a third transcription, Whisper invented a non-existent medication called “hyperactivated antibiotics.”\n\nResearchers aren’t certain why Whisper and similar tools hallucinate, but software developers said the fabrications tend to occur amid pauses, background sounds or music playing.\n\nOpenAI recommended in its online disclosures against using Whisper in “decision-making contexts, where flaws in accuracy can lead to pronounced flaws in outcomes.”\n\nTranscribing doctor appointments\n\nThat warning hasn’t stopped hospitals or medical centers from using speech-to-text models, including Whisper, to transcribe what’s said during doctor’s visits to free up medical providers to spend less time on note-taking or report writing.\n\nOver 30,000 clinicians and 40 health systems, including the Mankato Clinic in Minnesota and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, have started using a Whisper-based tool built by Nabla, which has offices in France and the U.S.\n\nThat tool was fine-tuned on medical language to transcribe and summarize patients’ interactions, said Nabla’s chief technology officer Martin Raison.\n\nCompany officials said they are aware that Whisper can hallucinate and are addressing the problem.\n\nIt’s impossible to compare Nabla’s AI-generated transcript to the original recording because Nabla’s tool erases the original audio for “data safety reasons,” Raison said.\n\nNabla said the tool has been used to transcribe an estimated 7 million medical visits.\n\nSaunders, the former OpenAI engineer, said erasing the original audio could be worrisome if transcripts aren’t double checked or clinicians can’t access the recording to verify they are correct.\n\n“You can’t catch errors if you take away the ground truth,” he said.\n\nNabla said that no model is perfect, and that theirs currently requires medical providers to quickly edit and approve transcribed notes, but that could change.\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\nBecause patient meetings with their doctors are confidential, it is hard to know how AI-generated transcripts are affecting them.\n\nA California state lawmaker, Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, said she took one of her children to the doctor earlier this year, and refused to sign a form the health network provided that sought her permission to share the consultation audio with vendors that included Microsoft Azure, the cloud computing system run by OpenAI’s largest investor. Bauer-Kahan didn’t want such intimate medical conversations being shared with tech companies, she said.\n\n“The release was very specific that for-profit companies would have the right to have this,” said Bauer-Kahan, a Democrat who represents part of the San Francisco suburbs in the state Assembly. “I was like ‘absolutely not.’ ”\n\nJohn Muir Health spokesman Ben Drew said the health system complies with state and federal privacy laws.\n\n___\n\nSchellmann reported from New York.\n\n___\n\nAP is solely responsible for all content.

      "# [Children’s Hospital Los Angeles to Roll Out Nabla Copilot Ambient AI Assistant by David Raths on 2024-03-12](https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/analytics-ai/article/53098833/childrens-hospital-los-angeles-to-roll-out-nabla-copilot-ambient-ai-assistant)\nA key area of focus these days for chief medical information officers is deploying ambient AI assistants for clinicians to record patient encounters and cut down on the burden of EHR documentation. Healthcare Innovation recently spoke with Matt Keefer, M.D., chief medical informatics officer at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles about the results of a pilot project involving Nabla Copilot.\n\nKeefer is a member of the Department of General Pediatrics at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and a clinical professor in the Department of Pediatrics at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.\n\nNabla Copilot is also in use at The Permanente Medical Group, Mankato Clinic, Frontier Psychiatry, and others.\n\nAlthough based in Paris, Nabla is focused on the U.S. healthcare market. Founded in 2018, the company has proprietary large language models and speech-to-text technologies built by former Facebook AI Research engineers.\n\nHCI: Could you talk a little bit about some of the EHR challenges your organization has had — and that hospitals in general have — that make something like Nabla’s ambient AI assistant attractive? Are there burnout issues related to EHR documentation you wanted to address?\n\nKeefer: I think I can safely say that no one went into medicine with the intent of documenting. That brings very little joy to anybody's work day. With the expansion of the EMR, there are some wonderful things, including 100 percent availability of the chart to those who need it. There are also some downsides, which involve a lot more typing, and especially for clinicians who aren't super tech-savvy, it means a lot of interaction with the system that they think is sometimes a barrier between them and their patients.\n\nHCI: There are several companies entering this ambient AI assistant space. How did your organization decide which one to work with? What drew you to Nabla?\n\nKeefer: We certainly did look around at some of the different options. One of the things that really drew us to Nabla was the responsiveness of the team, the interest in improving the product with us and being able to understand how our clinicians were interacting with the patients. In particular, we have a fairly large percentage of our patients and families who speak languages other than English, Spanish being the predominant one. They were very open to understanding that workflow, and trying to ensure that we could could be as as efficient as possible with that.\n\nHCI: You conducted a pilot with 30 pediatric specialists. What are some things you had to tailor specifically for the pediatric hospital setting?\n\nKeefer: We have surgical subspecialties, medical subspecialties, and general pediatrics, and clearly those all have slightly different variations in terms of how their visits go. We also deliberately chose people in different parts of their career — senior faculty, junior faculty, those who are tech-savvy, those who weren’t, and some who were already using things for dictation. We worked with the general pediatricians to come up with a better template for keeping track of information that you would have in a typical well-child exam. Nabla was able to respond to specific requests for how to format the note in a way that would be germane to a pediatrician.\n\nHCI: What about integration with your Oracle Cerner EHR? Is that something that came right out of the box, or did you have to do some work on that?\n\nKeefer: I would say that no integration comes without some work. Certainly, that was one of the other things that we really enjoyed working with Nabla on. We came up with workflows that worked for integration with Oracle Health, and the team from Nabla had already been connected with them, and we're working on on the next steps to further that integration.\n\nHCI: Were there things that you wanted to measure during the pilot in terms of doctor-patient interactions or clinician time spent documenting to see some improvement before moving on to a larger implementation?\n\nKeefer: We did. We have Oracle Health data to look at time documenting after hours and things like that. We also did structured questionnaires with all the pilot users, and the Nabla team has them rate the notes to give them feedback on on the quality of the notes and what needed to be changed.\n\nHCI: Do you feel positive enough now that you're going to roll it out organization-wide?\n\nKeefer: Yes. We’re hoping to start that up with a group of 27 pediatricians next week. We also want to try use cases outside of just the physicians. So we're working with social workers and some other team members, such as psychologists — anybody who has a narrative experience with the patient.\n\nAlso joining the conversation were Nabla CEO and co-founder Alex Lebrun and Chief Medical Officer Ed Lee, M.D.\n\nHCI: Dr. Lee, tell us about your background and how you came to Nabla?\n\nLee: I am an internal medicine primary care physician. I've been with Nabla as the chief medical officer officially for about three weeks now, but I've actually been working with Nabla for quite some time. I previously served as the chief information officer for the Permanente Federation, which is sort of a consulting advisory body to the Permanente Medical Group. I was in that role for about five years and with Kaiser Permanente for over 20 years as a practicing clinician and I still practice there now.\n\nIn the pilot work that we did with Nabla early on at Permanente, we actually did see a decrease in time in charting anywhere from 25 to 30 percent within each particular encounter. If you’ve got 20-plus encounters per day, that adds up to a couple hours per day.\n\nHCI: What are some things that distinguish Nabla from the competitors entering this space?\n\nLebrun: I think the fact that we start from physicians, from the users, and go bottom up is a very, very big differentiation. We push our product directly to physicians. Actually, there is a free version that they can use for free for up to 30 encounters per month. And then they become our champions. So we start to have users inside the organizations and they become our champions and eventually, we have enterprise contracts.\n\nThat has big consequences, because since we designed the product to be self-service, you should understand it in two minutes by yourself without any training. Otherwise these bottom-up approaches don't work. So it is very easy to deploy. This is one of the differences.\n\nSomething else is we recognized from the start that every organization has different processes. I've never met two physicians who agree on what is a best note. So we know we need to customize. It's more like a platform that we need to customize for every customer. For instance, pediatrics was very different for us because there are maybe two parents, two children and one interpreter in the room. It's very complicated. We had never seen that before. But we could adapt the product in a few weeks to support that. We don't see this as an off-the-shelf product, but more as a platform that we can very quickly adapt to every customer. So we think this makes us a little bit different due to our ability to do that.\n\nLee: That's how I originally heard of it at Kaiser Permanente. We had some users try the free version. Then they started contacting me and said, ‘Hey, have you seen that? We need to get this here within our organization.’\n\nOne of the things that attracted Kaiser to Naba was their responsiveness, their innovation, their ability to really partner. I love the word partner rather than the word vendor because they really did come in and listen to our needs, adapt to our needs, and then build and customize. Every physician writes notes in the way they want to write it. It's a very personal thing, actually. And so the different type of customization options that are built in weren't initially built in with Nabla, but through the partnership they were built in, and I think that's a similar experience that Dr. Keefer may have had at CHLA as well.",
      "# [powered clinical note platform by Maria Deutscher, MIKE WHEATLEY, JAMES FARRELL, DUNCAN RILEY on 2024-01-05](https://siliconangle.com/2024/01/05/nabla-raises-24m-ai-powered-clinical-note-platform/)\nNabla Technologies, a startup helping medical professionals create clinical notes faster, today announced that it has closed a $24 million funding round.\n\nThe Series B investment was led by Cathay Innovation with participation from ZEBOX Ventures. It brings Boston-based Nabla’s total outside funding to more than $43 million.\n\nMedical professionals spend up to several hours per week writing clinical notes, brief documents that describe a patient’s medical condition. They often also contain related information such as treatment plans. Nabla has developed an artificial intelligence platform, dubbed the Nabla Copilot, that can generate clinical notes automatically to save time for physicians.\n\nThe company says that its platform is powered by internally-developed large language models. Its model development team includes former engineers from Meta Platforms Inc.’s AI research group. The company counts Meta’s chief AI scientist, deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun, among its advisers.\n\nNabla’s Copilot platform generates clinical notes based on information that patients share during doctor’s visits. According to the company, setting up its platform before an appointment takes about 30 seconds. Copilot can be used during both in-person medical consultations and telehealth sessions.\n\nThe platform generates clinical notes in two steps. First, it creates a transcript that captures the remarks of both the patient and doctor who participated in a medical consultation. From there, Copilot distills the transcript into a clinical note that summarizes key details such as the patient’s medical condition, symptoms and treatment plan.\n\nThe platform also automates the task of loading clinical information into a healthcare organization’s EHR, or electronic health record, system. Nabla says Copilot doesn’t retain the transcripts and notes it generates. The platform is compatible with the U.S. healthcare sector’s HIPAA data protection regulation as well as the European Union’s GDPR privacy law.\n\nNabla claims that Copilot can save up to two hours of manual work per day for physicians, leaving them with more time to provide patient care. The company also promises to help medical professionals ensure that the data in their clinical notes is accurate. According to Nabla, only 5% of the AI-generated notes created using its platform require manual editing.\n\nThe company launched Copilot last March and has since built up an installed base of more than 20,000 physicians. Following the Series B funding round it announced today, Nabla plans to expand the platform with several new features including support for more languages. The company will also work to widen the adoption of Copilot among healthcare organizations in the U.S.\n\n“Clinical documentation is only the beginning for Nabla,” said Nabla co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Alex Lebrun (pictured, right, with co-founders Laurent Landowski and Delphine Groll). “Health systems are looking to leverage the AI opportunity to support their healthcare teams in many different aspects; we are getting ready to be there every step of the way.”\n\nNabla’s Copilot faces competition from several similar offerings including AWS HealthScribe, a cloud service that Amazon Web Services Inc. debuted last July. It uses Amazon Bedrock, another AWS service that provides managed generative AI models, to generate clinical notes.\n\nPittsburgh-based startup Abridge AI Inc. also offers a platform that automates the creation of clinical documentation. In 2022, the company raised a $12.5 million funding round that included the participation of prominent AI researcher Yoshua Bengio. Bengio shared the 2018 Turing Award with LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton for their work on deep learning models.\n\nPhoto: Nabla",

      "# [Concerns about medical note-taking tool raised after researcher discovers it invents things no one said — Nabla is powered by OpenAI's Whisper by Jowi Morales, Bikki said:, Conor Stewart said:, drajitsh said: on 2024-10-27](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/concerns-about-medical-note-taking-tool-raised-after-researcher-discovers-it-invents-things-no-one-said-nabla-is-powered-by-openais-whisper)\nResearchers and engineers using OpenAI’s Whisper audio transcription tool have said that it often includes hallucinations in its output, commonly manifested as chunks of text that don't accurately reflect the original recording. According to the Associated Press, a University of Michigan researcher said that he found made-up text in 80% of the AI tool’s transcriptions that were inspected, which led to him trying to improve it.\n\nAI hallucination isn’t a new phenomenon, and researchers have been trying to fix this using different tools like semantic entropy. However, what’s troubling is that the Whisper AI audio transcription tool is widely used in medical settings, where mistakes could have deadly consequences.\n\nFor example, one speaker said, “He, the boy, was going to, I’m not sure exactly, take the umbrella,” but Whisper transcribed, “He too a big piece of a cross, a teeny, small piece … I’m sure he didn’t have a terror knife so he killed a number of people.” Another recording said, “two other girls and one lady,” and the AI tool transcribed this as “two other girls and one lady, um, which were Black.” Lastly, one medical-related example showed Whisper writing down “hyperactivated antibiotics” in its output, which do not exist.\n\nNabla, an AI assistant used by over 45,000 clinicians\n\nDespite the above news, Nabla, an ambient AI assistant that helps clinicians transcribe the patient-doctor interaction, and create notes or reports after the visit, still uses Whisper. The company claims that over 45,000 clinicians across 85+ health organizations use the tool, including Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and Mankato Clinic in Minnesota.\n\nEven though Nabla is based on OpenAI’s Whisper, the company’s Chief Technology Officer, Martin Raison, says that its tool is fine-tuned in medical language to transcribe and summarize interaction. However, OpenAI recommends against using Whisper for crucial transcriptions, even warning against using it in “decision-making contexts, where flaws in accuracy can lead to pronounced flaws in outcomes.”\n\nThe company behind Nabla says that it’s aware of Whisper’s tendency to hallucinate and that it’s already addressing the problem. However, Raison also said that it cannot compare the AI-generated transcript with the original audio recording, as its tool automatically deletes the original audio for data privacy and safety. Fortunately, there’s no recorded complaint yet against a medical provider due to hallucination by their AI notes-taking tools.\n\nEven if that’s the case, William Saunders, a former OpenAI engineer, said that removing the original recording could be problematic, as the healthcare provider wouldn’t be able to verify if the text is correct. “You can’t catch errors if you take away the ground truth,” he told the Associated Press.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter\n\nGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.\n\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nNevertheless, Nabla requires its users to edit and approve transcribed notes. So, if it could deliver the report while the patient is still in the room with the doctor, it would give the healthcare provider a chance to verify the veracity of its results based on their recent memory and even confirm information with the patient if the data delivered by the AI transcription is deemed inaccurate.\n\nThis shows that AI isn’t an infallible machine that gets everything right — instead, we can think of it as a person who can think quickly, but its output needs to be double-checked every time. AI is certainly a useful tool in many situations, but we can’t let it do the thinking for us, at least for now.\n\nContributing Writer\n\nJowi Morales is a tech enthusiast with years of experience working in the industry.

      "# [Health AI Startup Nabla Was Built On GPT-4. Now, It’s Abandoning OpenAI For Open Source. by Katie Jennings on 2024-01-05](https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiejennings/2024/01/05/health-ai-startup-nabla-was-built-on-gpt-4-now-its-abandoning-openai-for-open-source/)\nTwo years before the public release of OpenAI’s viral chatbot ChatGPT, researchers at health tech startup Nabla were already testing its underlying algorithm GPT-3’s potential applications – and limitations – in healthcare. “Should I kill myself?” they prompted the bot during tests in 2020. “I think you should,” the large language model responded.\n\nThis answer epitomizes what can go horribly wrong when relying on machines to answer health-related questions. “We knew we couldn't trust an LLM in any way to give advice,” Nabla cofounder Alex Lebrun told Forbes. “Any patient-facing stuff was out of the question.”\n\nHe did see another opportunity to use GPT-3 (and later GPT-4) in healthcare: to structure, analyze and summarize vast troves of data. Paris-based Nabla’s team went on to use a combination of different AI models to build a tool to save doctor’s time on burdensome administration tasks. That tool, called Copilot, lets them record a conversation with a patient and automatically generate the onerous clinical notes required for medical documentation and billing.\n\nBut OpenAI’s software is essentially a black box: The company doesn’t release the source code for developers to inspect and modify, like so-called open source models. As Nabla has grown and more of these large foundation models are released, Lebrun and his cofounders have decided to break the company’s reliance on OpenAI. “You don't control anything. They can change the version tomorrow, you have no way to keep the old one,” he said. “I don't think it's compatible with healthcare.” (Lebrun says Nabla made the decision before OpenAI’s board meltdown in November, but the drama “just confirmed our strategy,” he said.)\n\n“Pretty soon all of our interaction with the digital world will be through the intermediary of some sort of AI system ... Such systems cannot be proprietary and built by a few companies on the West Coast of the U.S.”\n\nYann Lecun, Meta’s chief AI scientist\n\nArmed with $24 million in Series B funding led by Cathay Innovation with participation from Zebox Ventures, Nabla plans to focus on fine-tuning open source models, such as Facebook’s LLaMA 2 and those from startup Mistral, and will phase out GPT-4. This round, which brings its total funding to $43 million since its founding in 2018, values the company at around $180 million post-money, according to a person familiar with the deal. And more is on the way: Lebrun said Nabla is planning to close a second tranche of around $10 million in funding by the end of February.\n\nSo far, Nabla’s medical note taking software, which it released in March 2023, has more than 20,000 users. Around 50 percent are primary care doctors, 30 percent are psychologists and psychiatrists and the remainder are a mix of medical specialities, said Lebrun. In October 2023, it scored a big contract win with the Permanente Medical Group, which includes 10,000 doctors who deliver care at health system giant Kaiser Permanente.\n\nBut in the medical note-taking space, it’s early days. Competitor Abridge raised $30 million at a $200 million valuation earlier this year, while Microsoft shelled out $18.8 billion to acquire Nuance Communications in 2022. These are just two of a dozen or so companies all competing for market share. “We believe that this is not a winner takes it all,” Jacky Abitbol, a managing partner at Cathay Innovation, said of the automated medical note-taking space. There’s no question that Nabla is the number one European company, he said, and “the initial traction gave us the confidence that they can be very competitive in the U.S. as well.”\n\nNabla’s approach, which includes head-to-head testing of different models to figure out which ones work the best, will make them more nimble – and ultimately cheaper – than competitors in the long-run, said Lebrun. That’s because open source models are generally free to use and the only cost is for cloud hosting, whereas commercial models charge licensing fees. He believes the future lies in using a combination of different open source and homegrown models for different tasks. “We really don't want to make a bet on one,” said Lebrun. “We think the most agile companies will win.”\n\nLebrun’s position as an open-source evangelist echoes that of his former boss and mentor Yann Lecun, Meta’s chief AI scientist, who has become one of the most outspoken advocates for open source AI. Though Lecun is an investor and advisor to Nabla (and his work on Meta’s open source AI model LLaMa makes him a direct competitor with OpenAI), he told Forbes he didn’t have any explicit conversations with Lebrun about the company’s decision to phase out GPT-4 and his influence was “indirect.”\n\nLecun draws an analogy about the current LLM debate between closed source models (like GPT-4) and open source models (like Meta’s LLaMa 2) to the battle over the future of the internet in the 1990s. While Microsoft and Sun Microsystems tried to impose closed operating systems on the nascent internet, ultimately open source platforms won out. He believes the same will happen with large language models. “Pretty soon all of our interaction with the digital world will be through the intermediary of some sort of AI system,” Lecun told Forbes. “Those systems will basically become the repository of all human knowledge. And this has to work in every culture, every language, every value system around the world. Such systems cannot be proprietary and built by a few companies on the West Coast of the U.S. It’s just not possible.”\n\n“It's bottom up sales ... triggered by a grassroots adoption from physicians.”\n\nAlex Lebrun, Nabla cofounder and CEO\n\nLecun and Lebrun, who both hail from France, worked together at the Facebook AI Research lab, or FAIR, in Paris. Lebrun joined FAIR in 2015 as its chief engineer after Facebook acquired Lebrun’s startup Wit.ai, which created software to help developers build applications that could understand text in different languages (which was integrated into Facebook Messenger). Previously, he’d sold VirtuOz, an early AI customer service chatbot startup, to Nuance Communications in 2012. (While Nuance is now one of Nabla’s biggest competitors, Lebrun said he did not work on any health-related projects at the company. He declined to disclose the acquisition prices of either company.)\n\nAt FAIR, Lebrun worked on Facebook M, a now defunct project that tried to blend AI models and human concierges to do things like book a rental car reservation. It was some of the early work on what we now know as large language models. He recalls a day at FAIR when the group was showing some of their work to a group of doctors in Paris. “This kind of automation, if you can adapt this to medicine, would be a game changer for us and for our patients,” he remembers them saying.\n\nIn 2018, he left FAIR and assembled a team — including CTO Martin Raison, a cofounder of Wit.ai and colleague at FAIR, and COO Delphine Groll, the founder of French e-commerce brand — to explore the best applications for AI in healthcare.\n\nNabla took a unique approach to product development. In order to get access to patient conversations to train the AI models, the company opened virtual clinics in France and the U.K. and recorded 30,000 patient visits over two years. Lebrun said they received written consent from all patients prior to recording.\n\nSince the launch of its automated medical note-taking software last year, the company is using a marketing and sales strategy that has more in common with tech companies like Slack and Dropbox, rather than the typical healthcare approach that relies on a large sales team. Nabla’s software is free to try and conduct up to 30 patient consultations per month. After that, it’s $119 per month for an individual membership. “It's bottom up sales,” Lebrun said. “We do enterprise contracts, but it's triggered by a grassroots adoption from physicians.”\n\nLebrun said this quarter Nabla plans to launch services that help clinics automatically generate the codes that are needed to bill insurance companies for particular medical services. The software can currently translate English, French and Spanish language patient exams with Mandarin, Portuguese and Russian expected to go live this year.\n\nOne of the other areas where he sees Nabla having a leg up is data privacy. All transcripts and visit summaries are stored locally on the doctor’s computer, meaning Nabla doesn’t store any customer data or use customer data to retrain its models, he said. (The one exception being if a customer wants to send feedback and are given the option to attach the transcript or note.) Unlike some competitors, Lebrun said, “When you finish your consultation, we forget everything about you.”\n\nMORE FROM FORBES\n\nForbesMeta AI Chief Yann LeCun On His Open Source Mission And The 'Surprise' Of ChatGPTForbesThis Startup Raised $30 Million To Take On Microsoft's AI Notetaker For DoctorsForbesEx-Meta Researchers Have Raised $40 Million From Lux Capital For An AI Biotech Startup",
