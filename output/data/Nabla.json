This sounds strange but I think it is somewhat comforting having Nabla there. Knowing if I need to stop typing and just listen to the person in front of me that decision isn’t going to cost me minutes and hours at the end of the day, taking time away from my family. I think this is a real trade off and decision primary care doctors make regularly. If I spend more time with a patient, try to help them and go above and beyond - that time is probably going to be taken away from sleep and family time.

While golfing in Idaho this weekend, another surgeon told me “I would rather deal with human waste, than spend extra time documenting my visits.” He has a scribe. Another very busy physician (also a leader in our group) told me today that she spends most nights typing notes. Yes Typing! All of this is to say that the normal medical provider is disconnected from the options out there because they are too busy and entrenched to see what is out there.\n\nRead more\n\nJun 7, 2023\n\nMatt MadsenFamily Medicine\n\nI am a resident physician in Fort Saint John British Columbia. I just can't stop talking about your product to colleagues and friends. I imagine I am not the only one doing this. This product is just amazing. I was wondering if the group were at all interested in having a physician representative in Canada? If not, is there a chance to buy shares in the company? I just really believe in this product.

This sounds strange but I think it is somewhat comforting having Nabla there. Knowing if I need to stop typing and just listen to the person in front of me that decision isn’t going to cost me minutes and hours at the end of the day, taking time away from my family. I think this is a real trade off and decision primary care doctors make regularly. If I spend more time with a patient, try to help them and go above and beyond - that time is probably going to be taken away from sleep and family time.

For longer transcripts, the generation will take few more seconds. You can either make a synchronous HTTP call, or rely on our asynchronous webhook callback which avoids blocking calls and is more resilient to network interruptions.\n\nSummarize, with a patient-friendly language, the instructions given by the healthcare provider during an encounter.\n\nExtract conditions (including the related ICD-10 codes) and family history from a given clinical note, in a FHIR-compatible format.\n\nSend live audio of a provider's dictation to our speech-to-text engine, and receive accurately transcribed text in real-time.",

My practice has been looking into these new AI medical scribes to help with our clinical documentation. Everyone’s pretty burned out from spending so much time on patient notes, so this seems like a really interesting solution. Are these tools safe & legit?\n\nI wanted to try DeepScribe and DAX but it seems like you have to go through sales. A friend recommended NoteMD and I’ve been trying it out for a few days. So far it’s pretty good (it doesn’t save patient recordings which is great), but sometimes it doesn’t capture a sentence or two.\n\nWhat do people think about using these? Are they safe?\n\nEDIT: Thanks all for your comments, please stop spamming me in DMs :-) Our practice ended up with NoteMD which is working great.\n\n## Comment ID ks7b78p with +34 score by [(DrTestificate_MD, Reddit, 2024-02-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7b78p/) (in reply to ID 1b0befu):\nYes some people are using them.

I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers. Full HIPAA compliance and patient information is protected.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more! You can also shoot me an email ernest.chan@getathelas.com and I'd be happy to chat more.\n\n### Comment ID kxgt1mx with +1 score by [(No_Butterfly_4596, Reddit, 2024-03-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/kxgt1mx/) (in reply to ID ktnqhk1):\nAthelas looks great but $350 a month?\n\n#### Comment ID kxlc703 with +1 score by [(ekwcq, Reddit, 2024-04-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/kxlc703/) (in reply to ID kxgt1mx):\nShoot me an email!

I'm part of the product team here at [Heidi](https://www.heidihealth.com/)!\n\nPsychiatrists & psychologists make up a large % of our users. We've worked hard at making Heidi robust and able to sift through just about any non-relevant information that happens in a visit.\n\nUnlike all the other AI scribes out there, we've made what they all do, FREE, and some features unique to us available with a subscription (still cheaper than them). Things like \"Ask AI\" \\~ your AI personal assistant, ask it to generate documents, split notes, ask billing codes, return your transcript etc, the sky is the limit.\n\nYou can use this over zoom \\~ you'll just have to play audio out loud and it will capture everything quite well. Sharing audio between softwares is tricky from an eng POV but it is something on our roadmap, we just want to make sure it's 🤌 before a major rollout.\n\nLet us know how you go, you'll get Heidi Pro as a free trial upon signup so play around with it as much as you like.\n\n#### Comment ID kue872b with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/kue872b/) (in reply to ID kuajtlo):\nMax friendly?

They have a live scribe on with you all day to do your orders, coding, mapping diagnosis, etch and then the AI listens to your conversation that you have with the patient to capture the visit and then produces the note.  The live scribe imports the note to the chart.  It works great and the providers love it.  The scribes are off shore so the cost is low.  The AI note outputs are quite impressive and having a real person help the doctors made adoption very easy.

It gives you a gender neutral HPI (i.e. uses \"they/them\" pronouns) as well as mental status exam (I'm in psychiatry) and plan.  The MSE and plan are useless, at least for me. The HPI is decent.\n\nFreed doesn't show you a transcription live but you can access it afterwards. It gives a better HPI than Nabla and you can choose gender so it sounds better than using \"they/them\" all over. It also does a more honest job at the MSE; basically never attempts to write one and says \"not enough objective data.\" It also gives a plan and after visit summary. Both are really solid. Anything you say during the appointment in terms of plan, it'll capture. If I mention diet and exercise, it'll put in specifically what I said rather than just say \"lifestyle changes\". I have a template for plan that I prefer using so I don't actually use that part but I could easily see someone finding it useful (unlike Nabla where I don't think most people would find the generated plan sufficient). The after visit summary is gold though. Writes instructions as a letter from you to the patient, with an easy to read list of what was talked about during the appointment. \n\nIf they cut the price in half, I'd recommend Freed without any doubt.

I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers. Full HIPAA compliance and patient information is protected.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more! You can also shoot me an email ernest.chan@getathelas.com and I'd be happy to chat more.\n\n## Comment ID k23jy34 with +1 score by [(toastycitrus, Reddit, 2023-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k23jy34/) (in reply to ID 16qm7ji):\nEdit\n\n### Comment ID ki1hlaw with +1 score by [(Emotional_Walrus_782, Reddit, 2024-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/ki1hlaw/) (in reply to ID k23jy34):\nCan actually do this with Heidi.

I’ve been using Suki. It has direct access to my EMR and schedule so it’s as simple as clicking the patients name and starting the “note”. I access it through my phone and leave the phone near the patient and myself. It then processes the ramblings (I can be all over the place sometimes) of the visit and manages to organize it into HPI and a/p VERY accurately and in better detail than what I would normally do without it. It also does physical exam and other things like patient instructions but you’d need to speak out the physical exam which is weird. It has been life changing because it takes away the mental burden of documenting after seeing patients. I often do all my notes at lunch and then after the afternoon session because it allows me to stay on time and focus on the patient. Knowing all the details are being captured and all I need to do is organize the note a little is FANTASTIC. It requires so much less brain power than formulating the note and truly does it so well.\n\nCurrently offered by my practice but it’s 400 a month which is pricey.

These are the ones on my radar:\n\n- I have heard good things about Freed, but haven’t tried them. Their website doesn’t do a good job of showing off the potential, so I’m not sure why so many have tried it.\n- I have tried Nabla, and it seems great for the HPI section of a psychiatric intake, if you don’t mind it excluding some details. The problem is the option to add custom instructions isn’t very robust and prevents you from, say, adding a template and having the AI fill it out. It’s free to try out and easy to sign up.\n- I have heard people talk highly about Lindy AI, and it apparently can be used to automate more of your workflow than just note writing. Their CEO apparently has gotten in trouble for some shady things, but I’m very interested in trying them out.\n- Ambience Healthcare’s website had some sample transcriptions from their AI a few months ago, and I was very impressed. It’s on my radar to try soon\n- I wouldn’t recommend DeepScribe, as they historically marketed having your note ready only after several hours, which I believe is because they send the audio transcripts to employees for quality assurance, but maybe this has changed.\n- I wouldn’t recommend DeepCura. I didn’t like their UI and people have said they make it very difficult to cancel your subscription.\n- I wouldn’t recommend Amazon’s AWS Healthscribe since it’s very expensive compared to the competition.\n- Similarly, I suspect Nuance’s scribe is very expensive, as well.\n\nThere are other’s, like Suki ai, AutoScribe, iScribe, and more, but I have never heard anyone talk about these. I’m hoping r/Psychiatry can reach a consensus as to the clear favorite, but we’re not there yet. If I had to recommend some to try, I would go with the first four I mentioned.\n\n### Comment ID kt1kk1q with +6 score by [(Xvi_G, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1kk1q/) (in reply to ID kt1k11a):\nThank you\n\nI'm pretty sure it was your (this) specific response that I most wanted to revisit form the old post\n\n### Comment ID kt37dto with +2 score by [(pickyvegan, Reddit, 2024-03-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt37dto/) (in reply to ID kt1k11a):\nDeepScribe has changed- your note is ready almost immediately now.\n\n### Comment ID l0krb3x with +2 score by [(Proper_Parking_2461, Reddit, 2024-04-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/l0krb3x/) (in reply to ID kt1k11a):\nI’ve been using Twofold and its been really doing the job.

It costs me about 25 cents to do a progress note and 75 cents to do an evaluation.  I predict the costs to come down even more in the future.  Not having to type anymore during appointments - priceless.  I have arthritis in my hands so I could not stand the constant banging on the keyboard all day. It is also better because I can pay more attention to my patients and less to my keyboard.  I think my bill to Microsoft cognitive services (GPT-4 calls) is like $40-50/mo.\n\nIt also does after visit summaries for the patient. I also told it the APA criteria for CPT coding, so it helps me with that as well.\n\nMicrosoft does a BAA with everyone and says their implementation of GPT-4 is HIPAA compliant.  That being said, I don't put patients' last names into GPT-4, to keep the data somewhat deidentified.  I tried to get a BAA with OpenAI, who ignored all my messages, and I went down the rathole trying to encrypt all the PHI in the transcript, then decrypt the output.  Although it was a mistake, I did create a wonderful and effective LLM tool for automatically deidentifying and reidentifying healthcare information, though.\n\nIt works great, listens to all my patients appointments and churns out notes in the background while I work.  At the end of the day, there are my notes.  The quality of the notes is excellent. All must be proofread because the AI does occasionally make a mistake.\n\nI haven't had much luck getting it to diagnose patients or create treatment plans, not that I would trust it for such a thing, but I had some initial hopes for creating an \"AI colleague\", which were dashed.  It will scribe whatever I said to the patient during the appointment, but it doesn't seem to have any thinking or reasoning ability of its own. It is wonderful at organizing and summarizing information, though.\n\nI'm fulltime clinical, so it took me about 3 months of tinkering in my spare time to get something workable. I am a bit rusty, and had to get up to speed on all the new technology as well as teach myself Python.\n\nMy malpractice carrier advised me to get and document verbal approval from patients. After hearing about it, all except 1 said yes. She took some introductory LLM class and didn't seem to understand the technology very well, just enough to be scared of it.\n\nI have some colleagues who are working on a product called Berries ([berries.icu](https://berries.icu)). We have basically created the same sort of software independently, but they are productizing it and have it open beta right now.  The cost is reasonable and I saw a demo that seemed promising.\n\n### Comment ID m05kb5s with +2 score by [(Technical_Catch3880, Reddit, 2024-12-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/m05kb5s/) (in reply to ID kt2y1rx):\nThank you for this.

Berries is the best thing I've seen yet in the commercial space for psychiatrists.\n\nI have CAP/MPT. The rep I spoke to seemed well aware of AI technology and had an answer ready for me.  At the end of the day, the note is still my note, and I'm responsible for its contents the same as ever, regardless of what computer tools I used to help put it together for me.\n\nI use Microsoft Azure because they gave me a BAA and they also claim their GPT-4 implementation is HIPAA compliant. ChatGPT is not HIPAA compliant regardless of whether or not they use data for training - don't ever put your patient data into Chat GPT.  I also don't put patient last names, addresses, birthdays, phone numbers, or other nonessential PHI etc into GPT-4, in order to maintain patient privacy even more. There are no laws or even regulations about this technology, but I am satisfied with the patient privacy precautions I've taken.\n\nMy state is a 2 party consent state for recording of electronic communications, so I need to document consent for that. Not that I would record my patient interviews without their consent. I don't know that you specifically need consent to share PHI with a partner for whom you have a BAA, but I do also explain the LLM technology to my patients and get their consent for it.\n\nIt was impractical to scribe a psych eval until OpenAI came out with the gpt4-32k model. Most evals are 10000+ tokens and won't fit into the 8k window gpt4 had. You could sometimes use gpt-3.5 with the 16k window, but even that was too small sometimes, and the results were not as good. These days, we have gpt4-turbo, which has a 128k token window and can handle anything I throw at it, for much less $/token to boot.\n\n## Comment ID kt196a7 with +26 score by [(Xvi_G, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt196a7/) (in reply to ID 1b4uvub):\nFor my own experience, I've only just dipped a toe in the water. So far have used both MDHub and Nabla\n\nMDHub has an app that uses your phone mic, and keeps recording of your screen is off or of you switch out of the app. That's a small thing but it has a big impact on convenience of the recording. Particularly if you are working with a low talker.\n\nNabla seemed to have the slight edge in regards to the final formatting of the intake note, but I should note that I only used them utilizing their own standard formatting. I did not utilize any template other than just noting it as a new session and recording\n\nEither way, I found that for me (at this point) my best option was pasting THAT note to Chatgpt, uploading a word doc that has my tight intake format, and dictating some of my own observations that wouldn't have been transcribed from an intake note (MSE, general assessment and differential, some intangibles, etc)\n\nI also can tell chatgpt the tone I am seeking (clinical, narrative-driven, symptom focused, etc) and get a pretty good final product\n\nIt's a developing workflow that still needs  a lot of tweaking but it makes for a pretty solid final note. And while this would be too much effort for a med check, it's been a huge time saver and burnout protection for my 90 minute CAP intake evals\n\n### Comment ID kt1lrpb with +11 score by [(zpacksnackpack, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1lrpb/) (in reply to ID kt196a7):\nSounds like a great workflow! \n\nOne thing I’d note is Chat GPT is not HIPAA complaint (unless you have the super expensive enterprise version). \n\nBastion GPT is a great HIPAA compliant version you may want to check out it.\n\n#### Comment ID kt1q0ht with +8 score by [(Xvi_G, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1q0ht/) (in reply to ID kt1lrpb):\nThat's good to know about the alternate option\n\nFwiw I don't have any identifying info in my notes\n\nThat's all attached later via epic dot phrases\n\nBut certainly good to keep in mind\n\n## Comment ID kt1gj47 with +7 score by [(touchfuzzygetlit, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1gj47/) (in reply to ID 1b4uvub):\nI used FreedAI but it’s expensive like $100/month\n\n### Comment ID kt1o3nm with +2 score by [(DekkuRen, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1o3nm/) (in reply to ID kt1gj47):\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n#### Comment ID kt1qqzr with +8 score by [(colored_water, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1qqzr/) (in reply to ID kt1o3nm):\nI use freed and I love it.

There are great reviews about DocVilla's customer service as well.\n\nBefore I pull the trigger and sign the contract with DocVilla, anyone has any comments, experience, suggestions based on my needs.\n\n## Comment ID ljw7rfo with +4 score by [(Best_Doctor_MD90, Reddit, 2024-08-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthIT/comments/1euj8v0/docvilla_vs_athena_vs_ecw_vs_kareo_vs_advancedmd/ljw7rfo/) (in reply to ID 1euj8v0):\nThank you all who responded and helped me to decide on the right EHR. I signed the contract with DocVilla and I am extremely happy with them.\n\n1. DocVilla is super fast and completely web and cloud based EHR. I have tried it on Mac, Windows laptop and iPad. It works without any issues and without any VPN downloads. I was able to create 3 locations and assign providers to each location.\n\n2. The Telemedicine works out of the box. It automatically sends a link to the patient when a telehealth consult is created. It's a no brainer.\n\n3. DocVilla does have a free patient portal. But they are working on a custom patient portal for us which will take some time for development. But they understand our needs for branding and connecting with our website.\n\n4. Texting, Messaging works out of the box. So we are able to send text messages to the patients and are also able to message the patients on patient portal.\n\n5. DocVilla will be doing our billing. They will start the enrollment process. We have to provide them the payer IDs.\n\n6. DocVilla has got ton of prebuilt templates. I was also able to create templates myself using macros. I have also asked their engineering to create a few more templates for us. They are even open to any workflow customization that we might need.\n\n7. DocVilla has its own proprietary speech to text. From what I have tested so far, its very accurate. It works on Mac, Windows and iPad.\n\n8. Inventory management is prebuilt in DocVilla. I have seen the videos and it seems easy but have not yet used it.\n\n9. eRx and EPCS worked out of the box. Already tested sending prescriptions.\n\n10. The most important thing, the customer service is super responsive. It's Sunday today. I had emailed them a question in the morning. Within a few mins I got a response from DocVilla with screenshot explanation.\n\n  \nI am glad I found DocVilla EHR and made the right decision. I would highly recommend DocVilla to anyone looking for all-in-one EHR software solution.\n\n  \nI also came to know that DocVilla also offers marketing (Google, FB, Insta), Website development services. I have not yet taken a quote from them. But its great if a single company is acting as a one stop shop for the practices. I have scheduled a call with them next week to understand these ancillary technology and marketing services.\n\n### Comment ID lt1jbf0 with +2 score by [(Soggy-Phone-6391, Reddit, 2024-10-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthIT/comments/1euj8v0/docvilla_vs_athena_vs_ecw_vs_kareo_vs_advancedmd/lt1jbf0/) (in reply to ID ljw7rfo):\nOur practice has used all of the EMR's listed and we really like DocVilla. \n\nKareo used to be great, they are now the WORST! \n\n  \nGood luck with your practice :) I do medical billing coding credentialing and licensing if you ever need help feel free to reach out. \n\n[Lynchpracticemanagement@gmail.com](mailto:Lynchpracticemanagement@gmail.com)\n\n### Comment ID lk7e33o with +1 score by [(mmohiuddinkhan, Reddit, 2024-08-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthIT/comments/1euj8v0/docvilla_vs_athena_vs_ecw_vs_kareo_vs_advancedmd/lk7e33o/) (in reply to ID ljw7rfo):\nIt’s awesome to hear that you’re happy with your choice!

I was trained on DocVilla. I can also schedule training with them anytime I want from within the EHR using a Calendly link. DocVilla also has a huge knowledge base (videos as well as how to do wiki). They do not charge anything for training and its unlimited. Not sure about online but they are part of a bigger technology company in New York. Maybe DocVilla is smaller than Athena or eCW or Kareo, but I would rather stick with a company where the customer service responds rather than have a big company where the customer service is MIA or the engineering cannot customize for my needs.\n\nOverall, DocVilla is not complicated. It's easy to navigate which makes sense e.g. Add a patient and create a consult. There is some setup needed for templates which was explained during training and is also there in the videos.\n\n## Comment ID lk1b70t with +3 score by [(Nerd_Doctor, Reddit, 2024-08-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthIT/comments/1euj8v0/docvilla_vs_athena_vs_ecw_vs_kareo_vs_advancedmd/lk1b70t/) (in reply to ID 1euj8v0):\nI see that you already started using DocVilla. I can vouch for it. I have used multiple EHRs including eCW, Athena, Kareo, etc. \n\nDocVilla by far is the Best EHR I have seen. We have a custom patient portal as well through DocVilla that is connected with our website and DocVilla did a phenomenal job. Their customer service is outstanding. Interface is easy to understand. It's all-in-one value of money rather than using multiple software and making connections between them.\n\nAll the best and keep us posted on how it goes.\n\n## Comment ID llb0br0 with +3 score by [(Best_Doctor_MD90, Reddit, 2024-09-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthIT/comments/1euj8v0/docvilla_vs_athena_vs_ecw_vs_kareo_vs_advancedmd/llb0br0/) (in reply to ID 1euj8v0):\nI would highly recommend DocVilla. DocVilla EHR delivered whatever they promised. My custom patient portal is also done which they promised will be delivered after labor day weekend. The custom patient portal is connected with my website so that patients can now Self Register and Self Schedule appointments with our own branding.\n\nI have not seen any other company work so swiftly and be so responsive.

We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers. Full HIPAA compliance and patient information is protected.\n* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.\n* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.\n* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.\n* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.\n* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.\n* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.\n* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.\nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more!

I keep seeing a few companies advertising AI scribe software and claims they can have their AI create a medical note from an encounter on the fly. Obviously, companies will always make their stuff sound better than it is so was just curious if anyone has used this and what they thought. I would love to have >90% of my chart done before I leave the room and just edit them at the end of the day as opposed to writing full notes.

Pt called 911 due to feeling unsafe at home.” No other information.\n\nIf any docs read this, do not consult someone if you write bullshit notes, don’t bother to call the consultant, and provide absolutely no explanation in the consult order. I have shit to do and I’m not digging through the chart to try to figure out what you want from me. I’m going to write a one-liner note that says, “Unclear reason for consult.

They also seem to be the ones picking icd-10s, but with little training in that department so you have to go back and make sure the codes are correct.\n\nI'm also really interested in hearing people's experience with using ambient AI scribe software.

Generally impressed. If they plan to continue exposing it to new data, it should get better with time. \n\nI think it’s important to keep in mind that the more structured your conversation is, the more structured the note will be. If you go back and forth between diagnoses it would make it more difficult for even a human scribe. \n\nIn settings of more multipurpose AI like GPT4 there is a position evolving called a prompt engineer. Someone who studies the impact of how queries are structured. We cannot control what the patient says, but we can gently direct them to give  us the info we need. Sometimes.",
      "# Post ID 1e7bwun: [D] Medical/Healthcare AI Experts: Where do Clinical LLMs Mostly Fail?\n with +52 score by [(aadityaura, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1e7bwun/d_medicalhealthcare_ai_experts_where_do_clinical/)\nI recently had an interesting debate with a colleague about medical LLMs. As we discussed where these models tend to fail, I realized something concerning: it seems that engineers and computer science experts often overlook the insights of medical experts and healthcare professionals who actually use these LLMs in practice. This disconnect might be contributing to a lack of truly high-quality LLMs in the medical field.\n\nThis realization got me thinking more deeply about the current state of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the medical/clinical/healthcare field. Would like to know:\n\n**Where do these specialized LLMs tend to fall short?**\n\nIf you're a medical expert, AI developer, or someone who works with these models, I'd love to hear your insights:\n\n* Have you noticed any consistent patterns in their failures?\n* Are there particular tasks where they struggle, such as:\n   * Named Entity Recognition (NER)\n   * Summarization\n   * Clinical note generation\n   * Other areas?\n\nReally interested in hearing your professional opinions and observations. Especially from those of you on the medical/healthcare side who might feel your input is often overlooked.\n\nThanks in advance for sharing your knowledge!\n\n## Comment ID ldzmiuy with +59 score by [(_jim_bo_, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1e7bwun/d_medicalhealthcare_ai_experts_where_do_clinical/ldzmiuy/) (in reply to ID 1e7bwun):\nLLMs fail on medical related questions following similar failure modes found in LLM use for any other specialized domain.\n\nUsing in-context learning, RAG and summarization to get relevant information into context works just like any other domain.\n\nIn medicine we are often paying Drs for their ability to follow rigid processes while identifying rare outliers. Those rare events are tough to validate new tech against and the routine pays their salary. Just not a strong business case for automation in the core clinical experience (in well resourced communities but the poor ones can't pay for gpus).\n\nLikely to see more use on billing and insurance. I imagine it will be hospital LLMs vs Insurance LLMs sending automated angry faxs at each other 24/7 pretty soon.\n\n### Comment ID ldzn0p3 with +10 score by [(_jim_bo_, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1e7bwun/d_medicalhealthcare_ai_experts_where_do_clinical/ldzn0p3/) (in reply to ID ldzmiuy):\nNot to say that LLMs aren't / won't be used in medicine.

All of these can already be used as a productivity tool, not a replacement,  just as it is for every other field the LLMs are currently being used in.\n\nLLMs excel in pattern recognition (because that's what they are at the very core), and while they're already amazingly efficient in this (we just get easily saturated by the sheer amount of stuff we've already seen from them), ultimately it all comes to context length (not the only factor, but the hard cap), which comes to the computing power, which comes to the amount of GPUs and energy.\n\nThey'll keep hallucinating and misdiagnosing forever to some extent, but so do people, even doctors. It's a matter of efficiency and statistical benefits. Just as if one would dare to sit into an autonomously driving car and trust that it will do the job better than a human, one would eventually trust the LLM's medical diagnosis (in a distant utopia/dystopia where your bodily functions are closely measured) because it's still statistically more accurate than a diagnosis without it.\n\n### Comment ID le2dh83 with +3 score by [(babygrenade, Reddit, 2024-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1e7bwun/d_medicalhealthcare_ai_experts_where_do_clinical/le2dh83/) (in reply to ID ldzmiuy):\n> I imagine it will be hospital LLMs vs Insurance LLMs sending automated angry faxs at each other 24/7 pretty soon. \n\n\nI'm imagining the reaction of the developer who is assigned the task of getting these two fully automated systems to communicate over fax.\n\n#### Comment ID lp0iwbg with +1 score by [(BigPoppaSenna, Reddit, 2024-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1e7bwun/d_medicalhealthcare_ai_experts_where_do_clinical/lp0iwbg/) (in reply to ID le2dh83):\nThat would be me: gotta get them hospitals paid so that they can keep helpting people!\n\n### Comment ID le3h6pb with +1 score by [(ButterscotchNo3374, Reddit, 2024-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1e7bwun/d_medicalhealthcare_ai_experts_where_do_clinical/le3h6pb/) (in reply to ID ldzmiuy):\nIf doctors follow “rigid processes”, doesn’t that make them particularly well-suited for automation?\n\n## Comment ID le1a0v7 with +24 score by [(matt_leming, Reddit, 2024-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1e7bwun/d_medicalhealthcare_ai_experts_where_do_clinical/le1a0v7/) (in reply to ID 1e7bwun):\nI wrote a paper on a similar-ish topic: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-023-00868-x. It focuses on medical imaging but the concepts are transferable.\n\nIMO the institutional barriers are a big issue. Doctors are in hospitals, top AI experts are in tech companies, so they almost never organically collaborate. And medical data is far more protected and sparse than most text data, so fewer people work on it. The few that do work in research hospitals spend most of their time writing grants and producing academic-quality code that is simply not up to snuff compared to the standards of software companies.\n\nLabels on medical data is another biggie. Some hospitals are really good about getting ICD codes for patient diagnoses in the record, which is essential for disease detection algorithms. Others don't really have this. Mixing such databases is another nightmare.\n\nIssues with site differences is what I work on specifically. These can manifest in weird ways. Let's say that an MRI scanner manufactured by GE is used in a memory clinic while one manufactured by Siemens is used in an ICU. So an algorithm would associate differences in manufacturer with neurodegenerative qualities and presence of injury. If the top psychiatrists in the world came from a university in France and it affected their word choice when writing notes, a naive LLM may associate dementia with the choice of French words somehow. Weird things like that. An AI model trained on data from a hospital in California may totally fail when deployed to a hospital in Massachusetts.\n\nTesting these algorithms clinically will be extremely difficult. If you want to test ChatGPT, you release it and immediately get feedback from 50 million people. If you want to test a medical notes algorithm, you need to convince an overworked doctor to risk the wellbeing of his patients for an AI model that likely won't work on its first release.\n\nI can think of more stuff but that's a list to start with.\n\n### Comment ID loxcvta with +1 score by [(Malifix, Reddit, 2024-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1e7bwun/d_medicalhealthcare_ai_experts_where_do_clinical/loxcvta/) (in reply to ID le1a0v7):\nTechnically the association with the brand and memory issues and French with dementia would actually work in an exam setting interestingly enough!

I don't know whether it's a public misconception, but those in the ML world seem to think we spend our time reviewing a complete set of data and giving a diagnosis.\n\nMaybe the problem is that it isn't clear where and how AI is meant to help with healthcare.\n\nWhen I've tried using LLMs for consultations (again out of curiosity), the main issues have been such general advice as to be useless (i.e. take blood tests) or to not take an important step backwards and say 'you can do this to sort this issue, but actually far more importantly what is going on with Y - that needs looked into.\n\nA lot of medicine is working out what you're going to do to get to an answer, not giving your best guess given the information you've got.  A lot of time spent is simply explaining to patients what you're thinking and the consequences of proceeding in a particular direction, weighing up how far to investigate (because you can investigate ad infinitum and cause a lot of harm doing so).\n\nThose are just a few random thoughts.

The latter can also be trained out or addressed with detailed prompt engineering.

In my experience, one key area where these models can be quite valuable is in clinical note summarization. We've had success using custom AI setups with Runbear, a tool that allows you to create highly specialized AI workflows in Slack. For instance, we use Runbear to manage and summarize patient notes, making it much easier for clinicians to access patient histories and keep records up-to-date without the cumbersome manual effort.\n\nHowever, even with these implementations, it's crucial to maintain a human-in-the-loop approach to validate the AI's output to prevent issues related to hallucinations and inaccuracy. This integration has shown promise in supporting medical professionals rather than replacing their expertise. Interested to hear if anyone else has had similar experiences or pointers!",

I use it solely for the HPI for the following reasons:\n\n1: I find it mentally exhausting to create a narrative that does not satisfy any metric for reimbursement, is often wrong 1-3 hours later when I cannot remember a detail, and as more patients review their notes that's the thing they focus on ('doc I told you I was in Reno when I sprained my ankle not Vegas').\n\n2. I like formulating the A/P, and it's critical for my follow-up, and DAX imo does not do a good job on this, certainly not better than I can do and it matters most for other docs to follow my logic.\n\nSince starting it I am able to close notes faster for the sheer fact that I do not feel gutted by the chore of dictating an HPI that is often of no clinical value to me since I already know exactly what needs to happen. I do read the HPI from DAX and add details sometimes or correct pronouns. Before DAX instead of dictating an HPI I would probably browse Reddit out of boredom and avoidance.\n\nI like it, and it took little time to make it pretty seamless.\n\nedit - many of the docs I work with use it for the whole note and are very happy with it.\n\n### Comment ID lur86lf with +5 score by [(bevespi, Reddit, 2024-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1ggmdf8/thoughtsexperiences_working_with_ai_scribes/lur86lf/) (in reply to ID luqsgbn):\nI use DAX as well. For the A/P, the gathering of information and putting it in the A/P naturally can be janky. That said, if I’m being super specific about my A/P, I will let the A/P recording for when I leave the room. When you say: plan for this patient is: 1. 2. 3. and dictate the A/P it will usually overwrite anything it would have generated naturally.\n\nFor example- Type 2 DM without complications and long term use of insulin (yay HCC): A1C at goal. No hypoglycemia. Microalbumin screen is negative. Continue current medications. Repeat DM labs prior to OV in 6 months.\n\n## Comment ID lurvcic with +18 score by [(DrCapeBreton, Reddit, 2024-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1ggmdf8/thoughtsexperiences_working_with_ai_scribes/lurvcic/) (in reply to ID 1ggmdf8):\nHeidi - literally saving me about 2 hrs of charting each evening and I feel so much more free to dive into complex patients with that extra time and not having to stress about remembering every detail because it’ll be there for me.

You can pay for a faster version but I wait the 10-15s for the note to generate by reviewing labs or inputting procedures/billing so I don’t see any need to upgrade.

I’ve always been a fast typer and good at taking notes and never really had any issues with charting. I find that I run it in the background for most interactions, but I only copy/paste from it for maybe 10 to 20% of them because most of the time, my own notes while I’m listening to the patients are a lot more succinct. I find it good for those ADHD type of patients who come in with long lists of complaints and keep jumping for one thing to another. Then I do a light edit to what I pasted from the Scribe. But for the overwhelming majority of interactions, I still find my own notetaking is better. And I’ve been told by staff that I have some of the most thorough and most organized notes of anyone else at the clinic so it’s not like my regular notes are too short or sloppy. \n\nMy colleague who owns the clinic is a massive Heidi devotee. He was thinking of retiring in a year, but now he says with Heidi, he plans to work another five years. I see some of his patients and actually find his notes from Heidi to be way too verbose and long. \n\nSo all in all, if you struggle with typing speed and/or aren’t a good writer, you might find it helpful, especially for certain types of interactions. But otherwise, I found it to be a bit overhyped. But I could see it being excellent for psychiatry notes, for example.\n\n### Comment ID lv4mt4z with +1 score by [(Best_Doctor_MD90, Reddit, 2024-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1ggmdf8/thoughtsexperiences_working_with_ai_scribes/lv4mt4z/) (in reply to ID lus9i8o):\nHow does it compare with Nabla ?\n\n## Comment ID lus6zne with +4 score by [(AmazingArugula4441, Reddit, 2024-11-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1ggmdf8/thoughtsexperiences_working_with_ai_scribes/lus6zne/) (in reply to ID 1ggmdf8):\nWe’re starting Heidi where I am.

The reliability depends on the scribe, some are poor and some are really good.\n\nI found something surprising: The new players in the market are providing much better and complete tools than major leaders like Microsoft's Nuance DAX. Overall, it does work for me, I am starting to see why it will be an essential soon.\n\n## Comment ID lb41g1x with +1 score by [(FerociouslyCeaseless, Reddit, 2024-07-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1dsa1e1/does_anyone_have_any_experience_with_ai_scribes/lb41g1x/) (in reply to ID 1dsa1e1):\nTried abridge and now only use it for simple ortho or uri visits. I don’t like how it formats is a big thing, the other is that it doesn’t include things or worse puts in wrong stuff. Takes me more time to read it after and then try to correct than if I just typed the hpi in the room.\n\n## Comment ID lb4depl with +1 score by [(Upper-Meaning3955, Reddit, 2024-07-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1dsa1e1/does_anyone_have_any_experience_with_ai_scribes/lb4depl/) (in reply to ID 1dsa1e1):\nWe utilize Freed AI and Deepcura. Personally prefer Freed AI, definitely saves a lot of time but isn’t foolproof.\nImplementing is easy as long as you remember to turn it on to record, cost about $100/mo for Freed AI. As a scribe, it was worth it for me from my office. The providers often comment that it phrased stuff better than they would have in that instance.\n\n## Comment ID lb5ysbp with +1 score by [(caityjay25, Reddit, 2024-07-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1dsa1e1/does_anyone_have_any_experience_with_ai_scribes/lb5ysbp/) (in reply to ID 1dsa1e1):\nWe use eCW and are using their new scribe. It’s decent for HPI, sucks for the exam, and is hit or miss (but mostly miss) for the assessment and plan. It’s annoying as hell to have to copy and paste things out of the lump plan because even though it matches up codes it doesn’t put the plan in the right spot.\n\n### Comment ID lb6w9ai with +1 score by [(redjaejae, Reddit, 2024-07-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1dsa1e1/does_anyone_have_any_experience_with_ai_scribes/lb6w9ai/) (in reply to ID lb5ysbp):\nWe are getting ready to trial this.

I coach my patients that I’m going to say things during their exam for the program to pick up on and that I’ll explain what everything means afterwards\n\n## Comment ID lb6bwdw with +1 score by [(Jedi_sephiroth, Reddit, 2024-07-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1dsa1e1/does_anyone_have_any_experience_with_ai_scribes/lb6bwdw/) (in reply to ID 1dsa1e1):\nNabla is fantastic.\n\n## Comment ID lbd6wrx with +1 score by [(AplloAIScribe, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1dsa1e1/does_anyone_have_any_experience_with_ai_scribes/lbd6wrx/) (in reply to ID 1dsa1e1):\nGive our Scribe a try.

I wanted to reach out regarding HIPAA compliant, AI automation tools that assists your providers with clinical documentation.\n\n* **Help providers create consistent, high quality documentation**\n* **Utilizing our AI to maximize $/encounter through smart ICD10 + CPT coding**\n* **Provide providers more perks to tackle labor shortages, turnover, and burnout**\n* **Create unlimited templates and custom rulesets to generate a note exactly how you want**\n* **An efficient write back into any web-based EHR system (athena, eClinicalWorks, webPT and many others)**\n\n* Feedback from a Provider: “Love the reduction in how much time we have to spend looking at a computer. Just the exhaustion in my eyes causes burnout and without having to stare at a computer all day - along with the emotional energy it takes, made the job really tough.”\n* ‘It’s one of the first times ever when a patient tells you a breakthrough or pivotal information where the knee jerk reaction isn’t to immediately look at the computer and document that. Everything is so much more fresh and the notes are much more specific in regard to each session which really allows for the authenticity of what’s happening in the sessions to be captured.’\n\nWhether from a clinical or business perspective, the goal is to make documentation more efficient so that you can see more patients and increase top line revenue.\n\n[**Schedule some time or reach out at ernest.chan@getathelas.com**](https://hello.athelas.com/c/ernest_chan#/select-time)\n\n*-* [*Athelas Scribe Testimonial Video*](https://hello.athelas.com/api/mailings/click/PMRGSZBCHIZTSNRRGQZSYITVOJWCEORCNB2HI4DTHIXS65TJNVSW6LTDN5WS6OBYG4YDGMJWHEYSELBCN5ZGOIR2EIZWKZTCGYYTIMZNGFSDCOJNGRRTKMJNMIYGKNBNMY4WCZBZHA2DOMTCMJSCELBCOZSXE43JN5XCEORCGQRCYITTNFTSEORCIMWVQVDLI54TC4DGIVMUIMLUHFCXUVCYNZEEKRBZMRVTE4RQJZJEGUKSOREEE22PLA2GOPJCPU======)\n\n*-* [*Athelas Scribe Demo*](https://hello.athelas.com/api/mailings/click/PMRGSZBCHIZTSNRRGQZSYITVOJWCEORCNB2HI4DTHIXS65TJNVSW6LTDN5WS6OJUGIYTIMBVGQ4SELBCN5ZGOIR2EIZWKZTCGYYTIMZNGFSDCOJNGRRTKMJNMIYGKNBNMY4WCZBZHA2DOMTCMJSCELBCOZSXE43JN5XCEORCGQRCYITTNFTSEORCKBXVATTIK5DGORCZK54HSYKLMRQVC5K7JVLXS4JWIMZUGRKKGRHUKQ2DPJZWEWKYJZTGOPJCPU======)\n\n*-* [*Athelas EHR Integration with Scribe*](https://hello.athelas.com/api/mailings/click/PMRGSZBCHIZTSNRRGQZSYITVOJWCEORCNB2HI4DTHIXS65TJNVSW6LTDN5WS6OJUGIYTINRVGUYSELBCN5ZGOIR2EIZWKZTCGYYTIMZNGFSDCOJNGRRTKMJNMIYGKNBNMY4WCZBZHA2DOMTCMJSCELBCOZSXE43JN5XCEORCGQRCYITTNFTSEORCMRCXIMZXGNYWUZCNKBRGKQ2WGJLFGVKUJBJUKMDQIVYXEZBSIZKXIUDKMR4S2WTROZ2EKPJCPU======)\n\n*-* [*Athelas Intake Features Demo*](https://hello.athelas.com/api/mailings/click/PMRGSZBCHIZTSNRRGQZSYITVOJWCEORCNB2HI4DTHIXS653XO4XGY33PNUXGG33NF5ZWQYLSMUXTQNTBMMYTOMDGGUYWENBUGIYDQOBXHAYTAMZZGNSTGNLDGVRGKNJ7ONUWIPJRGVQWEYJVMQZS2NBYGRSS2NBWG44S2YRYMM3S2OBXGA3TONRZMY4DSZBVEIWCE33SM4RDUIRTMVTGENRRGQZS2MLEGE4S2NDDGUYS2YRQMU2C2ZRZMFSDSOBUG4ZGEYTEEIWCE5TFOJZWS33OEI5CENBCFQRHG2LHEI5CEU2VGRJW6QRYIJAUCQJRJYZHMRDYNRRWE6SFIM4DIYJWJ5WWUQLTONQTEWKZFUWVIMK7JU6SE7I=)\n\n*-* [*Customized Formatting Demo*](https://hello.athelas.com/api/mailings/click/PMRGSZBCHIZTSNRRGQZSYITVOJWCEORCNB2HI4DTHIXS653XO4XGY33PNUXGG33NF5ZWQYLSMUXTKMBWGIZDKMJZMQ2TINJUMNRDEYTFGAZDEOJYGU2DAMZTGQ4WKNZCFQRG64THEI5CEM3FMZRDMMJUGMWTCZBRHEWTIYZVGEWWEMDFGQWWMOLBMQ4TQNBXGJRGEZBCFQRHMZLSONUW63RCHIRDIIRMEJZWSZZCHIRHCURQIRXWE2TGGZFVQY2PNZWUS4DGN5HUWRKTKNDXCNLJGRHUESBVKNEEGULQJBKWQUKFHURH2===)\n\n## Comment ID lblehyi with +1 score by [(BubblySass143, Reddit, 2024-07-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1dsa1e1/does_anyone_have_any_experience_with_ai_scribes/lblehyi/) (in reply to ID 1dsa1e1):\nI’ve used DAX since 2022.

A physician at our clinic first created [Autochart.ai](http://Autochart.ai) for our clinic's doctors, NPs, and other professionals, and it has saved us all countless time. Notes generate in <5 seconds and Autochart is also infused with lots of practical features like automatic snippet detection (acronyms, short forms, custom words) and support for over 100 languages (before and after transcription)! You can easily paste markdown or plain text into EHRs, and the software is lightweight as well.

      "# [Nabla](https://www.nabla.bio/news/denovo)\nToday, we’re thrilled to share a major advance in our ability to design antibodies fully computationally. We developed a new AI protein design system, JAM, capable of designing high quality lead antibodies de novo given just a target protein sequence and/or structure. We thoroughly experimentally validated this new approach on a range of therapeutic applications and carefully studied the therapeutic properties of these de novo antibody designs.\n\nWhere we are today\n\nRecent advances in deep learning have revolutionized our ability to predict the structures of proteins and design proteins de novo. While these tools hold enormous promise for medicine, there has been relatively little progress in using them to develop viable drugs. Antibodies, as the most established drug format, are a great first real-world test for de novo drug design. However, so far no AI systems have shown they are able to produce high quality lead antibodies from scratch in a way that is robust and generalizes across protein targets and antibody formats.\n\nOur advance\n\nWe introduce a new AI system called Joint Atomic Modeling (JAM) and use it to design de novo antibodies with good affinity, epitope-specificity, and function. We show that our antibodies have strong developability and other drug-like properties with no optimization, making it possible to replace traditional discovery with de novo design for the first time.\n\nWe show generalizability across a diverse range of soluble targets with orders of magnitude higher hit rates compared to traditional discovery, including a protein target with no known structure in the PDB. Next, we apply JAM to a set of multipass membrane proteins, which as a class are considered difficult to drug, and show for the first time we can design antibodies against them from scratch, including the first computational designed binders, of any kind, against Claudin-4 (CLDN4) and the GPCR (CXCR7). When JAM is given time to “think” and introspect on its results, we see significantly improved success rates and affinities - echoing recent trends for large language models (LLMS) and teasing the exciting possibility of “test-time scaling laws” for protein design.\n\nOur technical report is the first demonstration of de novo antibody design relevant to therapeutic discovery and the first evidence of computationally designed antibodies that can target hard-to-drug membrane proteins including GPCRs.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nWhat implications does this have for the development of new drugs?\n\nUnlocking new target space\n\nMultipass membrane proteins, like GPCRs, are notoriously challenging. Our approach enables the design of antibodies that can not only drug these targets directly but also serve as precise tools for target validation and the exploration of new biology.\n\nIntractable targets—such as tight junction proteins, disordered proteins, and transiently stable complexes—cannot be produced reliably in recombinant form, making traditional antibody development difficult. By designing antibodies entirely in silico and with high hit-rates, we bypass the need for recombinant proteins and could even directly test for antibody function from the onset of the discovery process.\n\nFaster antibody development\n\nOur results show significant efficiency gains in experimental time result from the small library sizes enabled by JAM’s high hit-rates. Importantly, this accelerates the antibody development process whilst also cutting costs.\n\nExcitingly, epitope-specificity enabled by JAM addresses a key attrition point in traditional discovery campaigns, where antibodies often fail to target the desired epitope. This boost in specificity increases the likelihood of discovering functional leads and cuts down on wasted effort.\n\nPrecisely controllable antibody behavior\n\nSpecies cross-species reactivity requirements can be used to guide epitope selection, streamlining the preclinical development process.\n\nEngineered selectivity can similarly be selected for at the epitope level, generating antibodies that either (i) target multiple related proteins with desired binding profiles, or (ii) minimizing binding to closely-related family members and/or dangerous off-targets.\n\nResults\n\nJAM designed antibodies have good affinity, specificity, developability and function within therapeutic range and exhibit strong early stage developability without any experimental optimization.\n\nGood affinity - We designed de novo antibodies against 7 disclosed (SARS-CoV-2 RDB, HER2, IL-13, PD-1, TrkA, CLDN4, CXCR7) and 1 undisclosed protein target and saw that top designs achieved double-digit to single-digit nanomolar affinities that put them within therapeutic-range for a high quality lead antibody.\n\nSpecificity - Importantly, designs made from one target rarely bound another target, suggesting good specificity. Excitingly, three VHH designs we made to Claudin-4 were over 100x more selective for Claudin-4 than three other closely related off target Claudins (3, 6, & 9). Strong selectivity like the result we saw here is critical to ensuring therapeutic antibodies are safe and can be administered at high doses to achieve the maximum therapeutic impact.\n\nEarly stage developability - We evaluated early stage developability properties of our de novo antibodies and found expression levels, monomericity, and polyreactivity at or better than leading monoclonals (mAbs). These are promising indications that these designs will behave well in manufacturing and formulation, two important hurdles to clear for a commercially viable drug.\n\nFunction - We tested the functional activity of our de novo antibodies using target-specific functional assays. For SARS-CoV-2, we measured neutralization activity using a pseudovirus assay and saw IC50 values in the sub-nanomolar range (0.65 nM). We also use epitope mapping to confirm our designed antibodies bound to the desired functional sites, providing robust evidence of disease-relevant function.\n\nWe use JAM to develop the first computationally designed antibodies against multipass membrane proteins, achieving strong affinity, specificity and desired function. This has long been considered a ‘holy grail’ of antibody engineering but has not been previously reported.\n\nMembrane Protein Targeting - We demonstrate JAM's ability to target challenging multipass membrane proteins by designing antibodies against two therapeutic targets: claudin-4 (CLDN4) and the GPCR CXCR7. To enable efficient screening of large design libraries against these membrane-bound targets, we leveraged JAM's general protein design capabilities to create soluble protein proxies (solMPMPs) that preserve the native extracellular epitopes while enabling solution-phase characterization.\n\nFor both targets, this soluble proxy strategy proved successful. Selected antibodies showed high-affinity binding to their native targets expressed on engineered cell lines, with maintained specificity. Notably, CLDN4-targeting antibodies also demonstrated binding to OVCAR3 cells, an ovarian cancer line expressing endogenous CLDN4, validating their potential therapeutic relevance. These results represent the first demonstration that computational design can generate antibodies against this historically challenging but therapeutically crucial target class.\n\nJAM shows strong signs of generalization, including to novel targets not in the training set, and demonstrates early evidence of test-time scaling laws. We show how using JAM to design experimental libraries further improves performance and compresses design and affinity optimization into a single experimental step.\n\nStrong Generalization - JAM demonstrated broad generalization across multiple dimensions of antibody design. We validated its capabilities on diverse targets by generating both single-domain antibodies (VHHs) and full-length monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), achieving comparable affinity and function across formats. Notably, JAM successfully designed high-affinity, specific antibodies to a novel target absent from the PDB, indicating genuine generalization beyond training data.\n\nScaling test-time compute - A particularly exciting finding emerged when allowed JAM to introspect on its outputs and perform multiple rounds of iterative design at inference time. By increasing these computational iterations, we observed substantial improvements: 3-fold higher success rates, 10-fold better affinities, and unexpectedly, greater structural diversity - all while maintaining developability and humanness. This previously unobserved relationship between test-time compute and protein design success warrants investigation into the best way to allocate compute between training and inference to maximize experimental success.\n\nOne-Shot Affinity Optimization - We further enhanced JAM's capabilities by combining computational design with focused experimental sampling. Using error-prone PCR to explore sequence neighborhoods around JAM-designed binders, we achieved up to 100-fold improvements in affinity, reaching picomolar binding strengths. This hybrid approach effectively compressed de novo design and affinity optimization into a single experimental step, significantly streamlining the discovery process.\n\nLimitations\n\nThere are a few things we're working on to improve JAM and to better deliver on the promise of de novo antibody design:",

This is particularly bad among pediatricians, a specialty that is seeing a nationwide shortage.\n\nOne cause of the problem is administrative work: for every hour spent with patients, clinicians spend two hours on administrative work. Many have also said that managing the electronic health record (EHR) is their biggest stressor with clinical documentation adding six hours per week of EHR work.\n\nTo help cut down on some of this burden for its clinicians, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) announced on Wednesday that it has partnered with Nabla, the developer of an ambient AI assistant for practitioners.\n\nNabla’s product, Copilot, generates clinical notes in seconds; instead of having to type notes during consultations, clinicians can rely on Nabla Copilot to transcribe the entire encounter and generate an accurate clinical note that is directly integrated into the EHR. This allows providers to be entirely focused on patient care and to save an average of 2 hours per day which are usually spent on documentation. Benefits include reduced cognitive load from clerical burdens, less stress, and feelings of burnout.\n\nCopilot also automates the generation of patient instructions and referral letters.\n\nNabla Copilot will be integrated with Cerner, CHLA’s EHR, and it will be rolled out to pediatric specialists after a successful four-week pilot program in which Nabla and CHLA’s clinical team worked together to tailor specific capabilities for pediatrics in a hospital setting.\n\nThat included Nabla adapting their note templates specifically for CHLA’s pediatric setting, for example clearly mentioning if the patient was accompanied during the encounter and by whom. In addition, Nabla will make it possible for Copilot to capture multiple people’s voices in the exam room, including the parent or guardian speaking on behalf of a child patient.\n\nIt will also allow practitioners to choose between having patient instructions addressed to the patient’s parent or directly to the patient.\n\nCHLA currently performs more than 15,000 surgeries and conducts more than 700,000 patient visits annually.\n\n“Children’s Hospital Los Angeles is committed to fostering a culture of innovation in service of both our patients and team members,” Dr. Matthew Keefer, Chief Medical Informatics Officer at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, said in a statement.\n\n“We are thrilled to be rolling out this new application across our organization that will not only improve the patient-family experience but also serve as a time-saving tool for our clinicians so that they can more efficiently operate at the top of their license.”\n\nCHLA is Nabla’s second contract with a health system, after The Permanente Medical Group (TPMG) rolled out Nabla Copilot to 10,000 physicians this past October. Nabla Copilot has also been adopted by provider groups and EHR companies, including the Mankato Clinic, Frontier Care, Opus EHR, and NextGen EHR.\n\nNabla, which raised a $24 million round of funding in January at a $180 million valuation, has gone from $0 to $3M ARR since the launch of Copilot’s and is projected to hit $15 million ARR by the end of 2024.",

They have long been considered the “holy grail” of protein drug development.\n\nNabla’s generative protein design platform is now making hundreds of these previously inaccessible targets available by enabling the accurate designing of conformation and target-selective antibody binders.\n\nTo enhance the patient impact of its platform, Nabla is collaborating with other pharmaceutical companies known for successful drug development.\n\nThese partnerships aim to enhance their pipelines with high-quality drug candidates targeting some of the most challenging and high-impact proteins.\n\nThey are also aimed at generating insights into disease biology and platform development.\n\nSince its launch in December 2021 with support from Khosla Ventures and Zetta Venture Partners, Nabla Bio has secured $37m in funding.\n\nNabla co-founder and CEO Surge Biswas stated: “We are unlocking new opportunities to build highly selective drugs against validated, but hard-to-drug targets with a degree of structural precision not previously possible.\n\n“We are excited to welcome Radical Ventures as our newest investor and to announce collaborations with three of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies to help us bring our work closer to patients.”",

      "# [Carle Health Chooses Nabla for Its Workflow Focus by John Lynn, John. These EMR, IT Marketing Conference, a healthcare IT conference, EXPO.health on 2024-08-20](https://www.healthcareittoday.com/2024/08/20/carle-health-chooses-nabla-for-its-workflow-focus/)\nThe term “workflow” comes up repeatedly in this interview with Dr. Ed Lee, Chief Medical Officer at Nabla, and Dr. David Lovinger, MD, FHM, FACP, Associate Chief Medical Officer and Chief Informatics Officer at one of Nabla’s clients, Carle Health of central Illinois.\n\nDr. Lee said that it’s critical for Ambient AI Assistant solutions to fit in with clinicians’ workflows. Dr. Lovinger advises clinical leaders to ensure the solution they choose can align seamlessly with their health system’s workflows.\n\nCarle Health chose Nabla after testing many ambient voice products; Dr. Lovinger says they are “not all created equal.” Carle Health found reaction from its clinicians to be “uniformly positive” after a four-week pilot.\n\nNot only did Nabla meet their requirements for quality and ease of use, but the company was great to work with. A team at Nabla is dedicated to training and onboarding for every roll-out. Dr. Lovinger says that unlike some vendors, Nabla is excited to hear users’ suggestions and work on new features that adapt to their needs.\n\nDr. Lovinger likes many of the features of Nabla: It reminds the doctor of things that they should advise the patient, and the AI can record more detail than the clinician remembers.\n\nNabla also “works hard” at integration with the EHR, according to Dr. Lee, who considers integration to be near or at the top of customer requirements. With a single click, a generated SOAP note goes into the Epic EHR. In addition, they can update the problem list with new diagnoses. In the future, they plan to work directly with other parts of the EHR, such as medication orders, family history, and social history.\n\nThey also want to move into automatic coding and clinical decision support. Dr. Lee says their goal is “bringing back joy to clinical care.” Check out the interview to learn more about Carle Health’s use of ambient clinical voice.\n\nLearn more about Nabla: https://www.nabla.com/\n\nLearn more about Carle Health: https://carle.org/\n\nListen and subscribe to the Healthcare IT Today Interviews Podcast to hear all the latest insights from experts in healthcare IT.\n\nAnd for an exclusive look at our top stories, subscribe to our newsletter and YouTube.\n\nTell us what you think.

      "# [Nabla’s Experience Generating 8 Million AI Clinical Notes and Where Their AI Assistant is Headed Next by John Lynn, John. These EMR, IT Marketing Conference, a healthcare IT conference, EXPO.health on 2024-11-12](https://www.healthcareittoday.com/2024/11/12/nablas-experience-generating-8-million-ai-clinical-notes-and-where-their-ai-assistant-is-headed-next/)\nOne of the leaders in the AI medical assistant space is Nabla. We’ve had a front row seat to their growth over the last year led by Alex Lebrun, Co-founder and CEO at Nabla. While at the HLTH 2024 conference in Las Vegas, we had a chance to catch up with Lebrun to hear about their growth as a company and how their product has evolved, from a solution focused on ambient clinical voice documentation to becoming a comprehensive AI assistant for clinicians.\n\nIn the video below, we ask Lebrun to talk about some of the major milestones they’ve reached including supporting over 45,000 physicians across 85 healthcare organizations, generating more than 8 million encounters with its AI medical assistant. He describes it perfectly when he says that it’s no longer a nice idea or a pilot. With 8 million encounters, it’s a full product that’s making a significant impact in the lives of clinicians.\n\nOf course, with all of these users, I had to ask Lebrun to share some of the stories of their customers’ experience with the product. Check out the video below to hear them. Plus, it was amazing to hear that Nabla has a Slack channel where they share all the testimonials they hear from their end users about using their product. What a great way to inspire their team.\n\nAfter talking about their current customer experience, I ask Lebrun to share what’s next for Nabla beyond real-time clinical note generation. He shares how one of the things up next for them is Nabla doing active CDI (Clinical Documentation Integrity). The technology has evolved rapidly where it will soon be able to nudge the clinician while the conversation is happening in the exam room.\n\nThis presents some great opportunities for Nabla to actively improve the quality of the clinical documentation and maximize coding accuracy.\n\nFinally, I ask Lebrun to comment on where Nabla is at with EHR integration and of course where people can go to get a demo. For those interested in seeing Nabla in action, you can watch the demo here.

      "# [News: AI tool for hospitals fabricates text in transcription, researchers say](https://acdis.org/articles/news-ai-tool-hospitals-fabricates-text-transcription-researchers-say)\nAmidst the many artificial intelligence (AI) tools introduced to improve documentation accuracy, one version of the AI-powered transcription tool called Whisper is being used by over 30,000 clinicians and 40 health systems to translate and transcribe patients’ consultations with doctors, MedPage Today reported. This tool built by Nabla is intended to free up medical providers to spend less time on notetaking or report writing, and it’s estimated to have been used to transcribe seven million medical visits.\n\nWhisper’s creator, OpenAI, has cautioned that the tool should not be used in “high-risk domains,” however, and three different researchers who conducted studies of the tool’s audio transcriptions found the tool is prone to making up chunks of text and even entire sentences.\n\nOne researcher from the University of Michigan told MedPage Today that he found such invented text—known in the tech industry as “hallucinations”—in eight out of every 10 audio transcriptions. A machine learning engineer analyzed over 100 hours of the Whisper transcriptions and discovered hallucinations in about half of them. A third developer said he created 26,000 transcripts with Whisper and found hallucinations in almost every one. While transcription tools are expected to misspell words and make other errors, engineers and researchers said they haven’t seen another AI-powered transcription tool hallucinate as often as Whisper.\n\nSome of the text can include racial commentary, violent rhetoric, and imagined medical treatments, experts have warned. For instance, in one transcription, Whisper invented a non-existent medication called “hyperactivated antibiotics.” Software developers said these tend to occur amid pauses, background sounds, or music playing. Unfortunately, Nabla's chief technology officer Martin Raison says it’s impossible to compare their tool’s AI-generated transcript to the original recording, because Nabla's tool erases the original audio for “data safety reasons.”\n\nParticularly in hospital settings, such mistakes could have “really grave consequences,” said Alondra Nelson, PhD, who led the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy until last year.\n\n“This seems solvable if the company is willing to prioritize it,” said William Saunders, a San Francisco-based research engineer. Earlier this year, he quit OpenAI over concerns with the company's direction. “It's problematic if you put this out there and people are overconfident about what it can do and integrate it into all these other systems.”\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson told MedPage Today that the company continually studies how to reduce hallucinations and appreciated the researchers' findings. They added that OpenAI incorporates feedback in model updates.",
      "# [Children’s Hospital Los Angeles to Roll Out Nabla Copilot Ambient AI Assistant by David Raths on 2024-03-12](https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/analytics-ai/article/53098833/childrens-hospital-los-angeles-to-roll-out-nabla-copilot-ambient-ai-assistant)\nA key area of focus these days for chief medical information officers is deploying ambient AI assistants for clinicians to record patient encounters and cut down on the burden of EHR documentation. Healthcare Innovation recently spoke with Matt Keefer, M.D., chief medical informatics officer at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles about the results of a pilot project involving Nabla Copilot.\n\nKeefer is a member of the Department of General Pediatrics at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and a clinical professor in the Department of Pediatrics at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.\n\nNabla Copilot is also in use at The Permanente Medical Group, Mankato Clinic, Frontier Psychiatry, and others.\n\nAlthough based in Paris, Nabla is focused on the U.S. healthcare market. Founded in 2018, the company has proprietary large language models and speech-to-text technologies built by former Facebook AI Research engineers.\n\nHCI: Could you talk a little bit about some of the EHR challenges your organization has had — and that hospitals in general have — that make something like Nabla’s ambient AI assistant attractive? Are there burnout issues related to EHR documentation you wanted to address?\n\nKeefer: I think I can safely say that no one went into medicine with the intent of documenting. That brings very little joy to anybody's work day. With the expansion of the EMR, there are some wonderful things, including 100 percent availability of the chart to those who need it. There are also some downsides, which involve a lot more typing, and especially for clinicians who aren't super tech-savvy, it means a lot of interaction with the system that they think is sometimes a barrier between them and their patients.\n\nHCI: There are several companies entering this ambient AI assistant space. How did your organization decide which one to work with? What drew you to Nabla?\n\nKeefer: We certainly did look around at some of the different options. One of the things that really drew us to Nabla was the responsiveness of the team, the interest in improving the product with us and being able to understand how our clinicians were interacting with the patients. In particular, we have a fairly large percentage of our patients and families who speak languages other than English, Spanish being the predominant one. They were very open to understanding that workflow, and trying to ensure that we could could be as as efficient as possible with that.\n\nHCI: You conducted a pilot with 30 pediatric specialists. What are some things you had to tailor specifically for the pediatric hospital setting?\n\nKeefer: We have surgical subspecialties, medical subspecialties, and general pediatrics, and clearly those all have slightly different variations in terms of how their visits go. We also deliberately chose people in different parts of their career — senior faculty, junior faculty, those who are tech-savvy, those who weren’t, and some who were already using things for dictation. We worked with the general pediatricians to come up with a better template for keeping track of information that you would have in a typical well-child exam. Nabla was able to respond to specific requests for how to format the note in a way that would be germane to a pediatrician.\n\nHCI: What about integration with your Oracle Cerner EHR? Is that something that came right out of the box, or did you have to do some work on that?\n\nKeefer: I would say that no integration comes without some work. Certainly, that was one of the other things that we really enjoyed working with Nabla on. We came up with workflows that worked for integration with Oracle Health, and the team from Nabla had already been connected with them, and we're working on on the next steps to further that integration.\n\nHCI: Were there things that you wanted to measure during the pilot in terms of doctor-patient interactions or clinician time spent documenting to see some improvement before moving on to a larger implementation?\n\nKeefer: We did. We have Oracle Health data to look at time documenting after hours and things like that. We also did structured questionnaires with all the pilot users, and the Nabla team has them rate the notes to give them feedback on on the quality of the notes and what needed to be changed.\n\nHCI: Do you feel positive enough now that you're going to roll it out organization-wide?\n\nKeefer: Yes. We’re hoping to start that up with a group of 27 pediatricians next week. We also want to try use cases outside of just the physicians. So we're working with social workers and some other team members, such as psychologists — anybody who has a narrative experience with the patient.\n\nAlso joining the conversation were Nabla CEO and co-founder Alex Lebrun and Chief Medical Officer Ed Lee, M.D.\n\nHCI: Dr. Lee, tell us about your background and how you came to Nabla?\n\nLee: I am an internal medicine primary care physician. I've been with Nabla as the chief medical officer officially for about three weeks now, but I've actually been working with Nabla for quite some time. I previously served as the chief information officer for the Permanente Federation, which is sort of a consulting advisory body to the Permanente Medical Group. I was in that role for about five years and with Kaiser Permanente for over 20 years as a practicing clinician and I still practice there now.\n\nIn the pilot work that we did with Nabla early on at Permanente, we actually did see a decrease in time in charting anywhere from 25 to 30 percent within each particular encounter. If you’ve got 20-plus encounters per day, that adds up to a couple hours per day.\n\nHCI: What are some things that distinguish Nabla from the competitors entering this space?\n\nLebrun: I think the fact that we start from physicians, from the users, and go bottom up is a very, very big differentiation. We push our product directly to physicians. Actually, there is a free version that they can use for free for up to 30 encounters per month. And then they become our champions. So we start to have users inside the organizations and they become our champions and eventually, we have enterprise contracts.\n\nThat has big consequences, because since we designed the product to be self-service, you should understand it in two minutes by yourself without any training. Otherwise these bottom-up approaches don't work. So it is very easy to deploy. This is one of the differences.\n\nSomething else is we recognized from the start that every organization has different processes. I've never met two physicians who agree on what is a best note. So we know we need to customize. It's more like a platform that we need to customize for every customer. For instance, pediatrics was very different for us because there are maybe two parents, two children and one interpreter in the room. It's very complicated. We had never seen that before. But we could adapt the product in a few weeks to support that. We don't see this as an off-the-shelf product, but more as a platform that we can very quickly adapt to every customer. So we think this makes us a little bit different due to our ability to do that.\n\nLee: That's how I originally heard of it at Kaiser Permanente. We had some users try the free version. Then they started contacting me and said, ‘Hey, have you seen that? We need to get this here within our organization.’\n\nOne of the things that attracted Kaiser to Naba was their responsiveness, their innovation, their ability to really partner. I love the word partner rather than the word vendor because they really did come in and listen to our needs, adapt to our needs, and then build and customize. Every physician writes notes in the way they want to write it. It's a very personal thing, actually. And so the different type of customization options that are built in weren't initially built in with Nabla, but through the partnership they were built in, and I think that's a similar experience that Dr. Keefer may have had at CHLA as well.",
      "# [Researchers say an AI-powered transcription tool used in hospitals invents things no one ever said by GARANCE BURKE, HILKE SCHELLMANN, apnews.com, garance-burke on 2024-10-26](https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-health-business-90020cdf5fa16c79ca2e5b6c4c9bbb14)\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Tech behemoth OpenAI has touted its artificial intelligence-powered transcription tool Whisper as having near “human level robustness and accuracy.”\n\nBut Whisper has a major flaw: It is prone to making up chunks of text or even entire sentences, according to interviews with more than a dozen software engineers, developers and academic researchers. Those experts said some of the invented text — known in the industry as hallucinations — can include racial commentary, violent rhetoric and even imagined medical treatments.\n\nExperts said that such fabrications are problematic because Whisper is being used in a slew of industries worldwide to translate and transcribe interviews, generate text in popular consumer technologies and create subtitles for videos.\n\nMore concerning, they said, is a rush by medical centers to utilize Whisper-based tools to transcribe patients’ consultations with doctors, despite OpenAI’ s warnings that the tool should not be used in “high-risk domains.”\n\nThe full extent of the problem is difficult to discern, but researchers and engineers said they frequently have come across Whisper’s hallucinations in their work. A University of Michigan researcher conducting a study of public meetings, for example, said he found hallucinations in eight out of every 10 audio transcriptions he inspected, before he started trying to improve the model.\n\nA machine learning engineer said he initially discovered hallucinations in about half of the over 100 hours of Whisper transcriptions he analyzed. A third developer said he found hallucinations in nearly every one of the 26,000 transcripts he created with Whisper.\n\nThe problems persist even in well-recorded, short audio samples. A recent study by computer scientists uncovered 187 hallucinations in more than 13,000 clear audio snippets they examined.\n\nThat trend would lead to tens of thousands of faulty transcriptions over millions of recordings, researchers said.\n\n___\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center’s AI Accountability Network, which also partially supported the academic Whisper study. AP also receives financial assistance from the Omidyar Network to support coverage of artificial intelligence and its impact on society.\n\n___\n\nSuch mistakes could have “really grave consequences,” particularly in hospital settings, said Alondra Nelson, who led the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy for the Biden administration until last year.\n\n“Nobody wants a misdiagnosis,” said Nelson, a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. “There should be a higher bar.”\n\nWhisper also is used to create closed captioning for the Deaf and hard of hearing — a population at particular risk for faulty transcriptions. That’s because the Deaf and hard of hearing have no way of identifying fabrications “hidden amongst all this other text,” said Christian Vogler, who is deaf and directs Gallaudet University’s Technology Access Program.\n\nOpenAI urged to address problem\n\nThe prevalence of such hallucinations has led experts, advocates and former OpenAI employees to call for the federal government to consider AI regulations. At minimum, they said, OpenAI needs to address the flaw.\n\n“This seems solvable if the company is willing to prioritize it,” said William Saunders, a San Francisco-based research engineer who quit OpenAI in February over concerns with the company’s direction. “It’s problematic if you put this out there and people are overconfident about what it can do and integrate it into all these other systems.”\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the company continually studies how to reduce hallucinations and appreciated the researchers’ findings, adding that OpenAI incorporates feedback in model updates.\n\nWhile most developers assume that transcription tools misspell words or make other errors, engineers and researchers said they had never seen another AI-powered transcription tool hallucinate as much as Whisper.\n\nWhisper hallucinations\n\nThe tool is integrated into some versions of OpenAI’s flagship chatbot ChatGPT, and is a built-in offering in Oracle and Microsoft’s cloud computing platforms, which service thousands of companies worldwide. It is also used to transcribe and translate text into multiple languages.\n\nIn the last month alone, one recent version of Whisper was downloaded over 4.2 million times from open-source AI platform HuggingFace. Sanchit Gandhi, a machine-learning engineer there, said Whisper is the most popular open-source speech recognition model and is built into everything from call centers to voice assistants.\n\nProfessors Allison Koenecke of Cornell University and Mona Sloane of the University of Virginia examined thousands of short snippets they obtained from TalkBank, a research repository hosted at Carnegie Mellon University. They determined that nearly 40% of the hallucinations were harmful or concerning because the speaker could be misinterpreted or misrepresented.\n\nIn an example they uncovered, a speaker said, “He, the boy, was going to, I’m not sure exactly, take the umbrella.”\n\nBut the transcription software added: “He took a big piece of a cross, a teeny, small piece ... I’m sure he didn’t have a terror knife so he killed a number of people.”\n\nA speaker in another recording described “two other girls and one lady.” Whisper invented extra commentary on race, adding “two other girls and one lady, um, which were Black.”\n\nIn a third transcription, Whisper invented a non-existent medication called “hyperactivated antibiotics.”\n\nResearchers aren’t certain why Whisper and similar tools hallucinate, but software developers said the fabrications tend to occur amid pauses, background sounds or music playing.\n\nOpenAI recommended in its online disclosures against using Whisper in “decision-making contexts, where flaws in accuracy can lead to pronounced flaws in outcomes.”\n\nTranscribing doctor appointments\n\nThat warning hasn’t stopped hospitals or medical centers from using speech-to-text models, including Whisper, to transcribe what’s said during doctor’s visits to free up medical providers to spend less time on note-taking or report writing.\n\nOver 30,000 clinicians and 40 health systems, including the Mankato Clinic in Minnesota and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, have started using a Whisper-based tool built by Nabla, which has offices in France and the U.S.\n\nThat tool was fine-tuned on medical language to transcribe and summarize patients’ interactions, said Nabla’s chief technology officer Martin Raison.\n\nCompany officials said they are aware that Whisper can hallucinate and are addressing the problem.\n\nIt’s impossible to compare Nabla’s AI-generated transcript to the original recording because Nabla’s tool erases the original audio for “data safety reasons,” Raison said.\n\nNabla said the tool has been used to transcribe an estimated 7 million medical visits.\n\nSaunders, the former OpenAI engineer, said erasing the original audio could be worrisome if transcripts aren’t double checked or clinicians can’t access the recording to verify they are correct.\n\n“You can’t catch errors if you take away the ground truth,” he said.\n\nNabla said that no model is perfect, and that theirs currently requires medical providers to quickly edit and approve transcribed notes, but that could change.\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\nBecause patient meetings with their doctors are confidential, it is hard to know how AI-generated transcripts are affecting them.\n\nA California state lawmaker, Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, said she took one of her children to the doctor earlier this year, and refused to sign a form the health network provided that sought her permission to share the consultation audio with vendors that included Microsoft Azure, the cloud computing system run by OpenAI’s largest investor. Bauer-Kahan didn’t want such intimate medical conversations being shared with tech companies, she said.\n\n“The release was very specific that for-profit companies would have the right to have this,” said Bauer-Kahan, a Democrat who represents part of the San Francisco suburbs in the state Assembly. “I was like ‘absolutely not.’ ”\n\nJohn Muir Health spokesman Ben Drew said the health system complies with state and federal privacy laws.\n\n___\n\nSchellmann reported from New York.\n\n___\n\nAP is solely responsible for all content.

      "# [Nabla Finance Public Sale: Redefining DeFi with Unmatched Yields by Bitcoinist on 2024-12-02](https://bitcoinist.com/nabla-finance-public-sale-redefining-defi-with-unmatched-yields/)\nWhat if earning the highest yields in DeFi was as simple as a single deposit? Nabla Finance is making this vision a reality.\n\nDecember 2024 — Nabla Finance, the next-generation yield protocol powered by the hyper-efficient Nabla AMM, is thrilled to announce its public token sale at Fjord Foundry, starting at 2 PM UTC on December 4 and ending at 2 PM UTC on December 7, 2024.\n\nWith groundbreaking technology and industry-leading yields, Nabla is revolutionizing the DeFi landscape. Nabla’s cutting-edge AMM technology has set new records, delivering the highest base APYs for assets like WBTC, cbBTC, WETH and ARB. By offering sustainable, capital-efficient returns alongside unmatched security, Nabla is rapidly becoming the platform of choice for users seeking high returns with low risk.\n\nNabla has the highest base APY rate in the WBTC yield space. Source: DefiLlama\n\nNabla Finance has completed three previous funding rounds, starting with a $6 million fully diluted valuation (FDV), followed by $10 million, and most recently, $20 million in May 2024, collectively raising over $750,000.\n\nThe upcoming public token sale is set at $6 million FDV, with a target of raising $300,000. It will open on December 4th at 2 PM UTC at Fjord Foundry.\n\nA Protocol Built for Simplicity and Security\n\nNabla Finance has reimagined liquidity provisioning with its innovative single-sided pools. These pools allow users to deposit assets without being exposed to any other asset price or market-making risks. In return, participants receive yield-bearing tokens that can seamlessly integrate into other DeFi platforms, maximizing earning potential.\n\nThe protocol’s advanced pricing system combines a high-frequency oracle, a volatility protection mechanism, and custom slippage curves, reducing risks like impermanent loss (IL) and loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR) by over 95%. Liquidity providers can get high organic yields while benefiting from stable, predictable returns.\n\nCapital efficiency is another hallmark of Nabla AMM. By always concentrating liquidity around the market-fair price, the protocol maximizes the value of every dollar deposited. Additionally, a built-in insurance mechanism, the Backstop Pool, safeguards all users against unforeseen risks, making Nabla Finance a fortress of security in the ever-volatile DeFi space.\n\nDriving DeFi Innovation with Unmatched Performance\n\nNabla Finance has made remarkable progress in 2024, starting with the successful launch of its public Mainnet Alpha on Arbitrum and Base in November. Following three months of private testing, the protocol went live, bringing hyper-efficient DeFi solutions to a broader audience.\n\nPowered by Pyth.network, the protocol utilizes real-time, high-fidelity price feeds to ensure accurate asset pricing and fair price discovery in its pools. Additionally, ODOS.xyz, a leading order routing solution, is integrating Nabla pools as a liquidity source, bringing increased trading volume and enhanced returns for users.\n\nThe development of EV:GO (Excess Volatility Guard Oracle), an in-house oracle system, led to a remarkable 10x increase in profitability.
