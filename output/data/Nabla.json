This sounds strange but I think it is somewhat comforting having Nabla there. Knowing if I need to stop typing and just listen to the person in front of me that decision isn’t going to cost me minutes and hours at the end of the day, taking time away from my family. I think this is a real trade off and decision primary care doctors make regularly. If I spend more time with a patient, try to help them and go above and beyond - that time is probably going to be taken away from sleep and family time.

For longer transcripts, the generation will take few more seconds. You can either make a synchronous HTTP call, or rely on our asynchronous webhook callback which avoids blocking calls and is more resilient to network interruptions.\n\nSummarize, with a patient-friendly language, the instructions given by the healthcare provider during an encounter.\n\nExtract conditions (including the related ICD-10 codes) and family history from a given clinical note, in a FHIR-compatible format.\n\nSend live audio of a provider's dictation to our speech-to-text engine, and receive accurately transcribed text in real-time.",

I have zero confidence that Kaiser will use this for anything other than benefitting Kaiser as well as major concerns about how they will protect the data.  \n\nThis quote from the article made me laugh.  \n\n“We focus a lot on bringing back joy to our users,” Lebrun said. “So when they talk about the value, our users tend to say 'OK, I really enjoyed caregiving again, I'm stress free, I can listen to the patient.'”\n\nKaiser is only doing this to squeeze more patient visits per hour out of doctors, nothing else.   \n\n## Comment ID l2a7w3j with +2 score by [(VapoursAndSpleen, Reddit, 2024-05-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/KaiserPermanente/comments/1cih9p4/medical_ai_scribe_startup_nabla_rolling_out_tool/l2a7w3j/) (in reply to ID 1cih9p4):\nSecurity breach in 3…2…1\n\n## Comment ID l2ak4oy with +2 score by [(NorCalFrances, Reddit, 2024-05-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/KaiserPermanente/comments/1cih9p4/medical_ai_scribe_startup_nabla_rolling_out_tool/l2ak4oy/) (in reply to ID 1cih9p4):\nFrom Nabla's site:\n\nGet instant clinical notes from any patient encounter\n\nAutomatically update your patients’ medical records\n\nSpend more time with your patients\n\nWorks with your computer microphone\n\nCapture everything even during examination\n\nWorks with any video encounter solution\n\nMaximize eye contact with your patient\n\nNon invasive, takes just a small corner of your screen\n\nWe don't store any data\n\nAudio, transcripts, and notes are not stored\n\nHIPAA and GDPR compliant\n\nSOC 2 Type 2 and ISO 27001 certified\n\n### Comment ID l2akzrv with +2 score by [(labboy70, Reddit, 2024-05-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/KaiserPermanente/comments/1cih9p4/medical_ai_scribe_startup_nabla_rolling_out_tool/l2akzrv/) (in reply to ID l2ak4oy):\nHaving previously worked on the vendor side for Kaiser (two different companies), I also know how they will demand custom solutions just for KP.

      "# Post ID 1b0befu: Best AI medical scribe tools? Do people use them? with +84 score by [(guiltless_inaccuracy, Reddit, 2024-02-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/)\nPhysician in a small clinic here. My practice has been looking into these new AI medical scribes to help with our clinical documentation. Everyone’s pretty burned out from spending so much time on patient notes, so this seems like a really interesting solution. Are these tools safe & legit?\n\nI wanted to try DeepScribe and DAX but it seems like you have to go through sales. A friend recommended NoteMD and I’ve been trying it out for a few days. So far it’s pretty good (it doesn’t save patient recordings which is great), but sometimes it doesn’t capture a sentence or two.\n\nWhat do people think about using these? Are they safe?\n\nEDIT: Thanks all for your comments, please stop spamming me in DMs :-) Our practice ended up with NoteMD which is working great.\n\n## Comment ID ks7b78p with +32 score by [(DrTestificate_MD, Reddit, 2024-02-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7b78p/) (in reply to ID 1b0befu):\nYes some people are using them. Permanente ran a pilot study making it available to 10000 docs and a significant percentage of them used it for over 100 encounters over a 4 week period. One doctor used it for over 1000 encounters in that time.\n\nThere are a ton available online now, some you can even use for free.

Use it if I'm seeing a new patient in the hospital. Takes some of the cognitive burden off, especially at the end of a 7 day stretch. 30 free consultations a month.\n\nNone are that useful for assessment and plan.

Captures most of what is said and knows where to put it (History, exam, A/P, PI etc). Produces paragraphs of prose. For some reason it sucks at documenting my reasoning in an A/P — wordy, misses the if-then logic. Helps a little with allowing more eye contact with patient during visit but I gave up on it. Takes me 2 min to write my own primary care notes (after a little pre-charting.) When an AI model can read my previous notes and learn how I document and reproduce my style then I’ll use it. Until then, practice a poetics of concision and save the $$.\n\n### Comment ID kuakl8t with +2 score by [(LordVile37, Reddit, 2024-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/kuakl8t/) (in reply to ID ks91vix):\nHey there!

It's really good at adding details I might not include, such as subjective information. It takes some getting used to, as far as having to say everything if you want it in the note. Useless for physical exams. There is no learning as far as the notes improving over time. The prompt system helps but can be wonky.

I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers. Full HIPAA compliance and patient information is protected.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more! You can also shoot me an email ernest.chan@getathelas.com and I'd be happy to chat more.\n\n### Comment ID kxgt1mx with +1 score by [(No_Butterfly_4596, Reddit, 2024-03-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/kxgt1mx/) (in reply to ID ktnqhk1):\nAthelas looks great but $350 a month?\n\n#### Comment ID kxlc703 with +1 score by [(ekwcq, Reddit, 2024-04-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/kxlc703/) (in reply to ID kxgt1mx):\nShoot me an email!

I'm part of the product team here at [Heidi](https://www.heidihealth.com/)!\n\nPsychiatrists & psychologists make up a large % of our users. We've worked hard at making Heidi robust and able to sift through just about any non-relevant information that happens in a visit.\n\nUnlike all the other AI scribes out there, we've made what they all do, FREE, and some features unique to us available with a subscription (still cheaper than them). Things like \"Ask AI\" \\~ your AI personal assistant, ask it to generate documents, split notes, ask billing codes, return your transcript etc, the sky is the limit.\n\nYou can use this over zoom \\~ you'll just have to play audio out loud and it will capture everything quite well. Sharing audio between softwares is tricky from an eng POV but it is something on our roadmap, we just want to make sure it's 🤌 before a major rollout.\n\nLet us know how you go, you'll get Heidi Pro as a free trial upon signup so play around with it as much as you like.\n\n#### Comment ID kue872b with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/kue872b/) (in reply to ID kuajtlo):\nMax friendly?

They have a live scribe on with you all day to do your orders, coding, mapping diagnosis, etch and then the AI listens to your conversation that you have with the patient to capture the visit and then produces the note.  The live scribe imports the note to the chart.  It works great and the providers love it.  The scribes are off shore so the cost is low.  The AI note outputs are quite impressive and having a real person help the doctors made adoption very easy.

It gives you a gender neutral HPI (i.e. uses \"they/them\" pronouns) as well as mental status exam (I'm in psychiatry) and plan.  The MSE and plan are useless, at least for me. The HPI is decent.\n\nFreed doesn't show you a transcription live but you can access it afterwards. It gives a better HPI than Nabla and you can choose gender so it sounds better than using \"they/them\" all over. It also does a more honest job at the MSE; basically never attempts to write one and says \"not enough objective data.\" It also gives a plan and after visit summary. Both are really solid. Anything you say during the appointment in terms of plan, it'll capture. If I mention diet and exercise, it'll put in specifically what I said rather than just say \"lifestyle changes\". I have a template for plan that I prefer using so I don't actually use that part but I could easily see someone finding it useful (unlike Nabla where I don't think most people would find the generated plan sufficient). The after visit summary is gold though. Writes instructions as a letter from you to the patient, with an easy to read list of what was talked about during the appointment. \n\nIf they cut the price in half, I'd recommend Freed without any doubt.

I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers. Full HIPAA compliance and patient information is protected.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more! You can also shoot me an email ernest.chan@getathelas.com and I'd be happy to chat more.\n\n## Comment ID k23jy34 with +1 score by [(toastycitrus, Reddit, 2023-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k23jy34/) (in reply to ID 16qm7ji):\nEdit\n\n### Comment ID ki1hlaw with +1 score by [(Emotional_Walrus_782, Reddit, 2024-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/ki1hlaw/) (in reply to ID k23jy34):\nCan actually do this with Heidi.

I’ve been using Suki. It has direct access to my EMR and schedule so it’s as simple as clicking the patients name and starting the “note”. I access it through my phone and leave the phone near the patient and myself. It then processes the ramblings (I can be all over the place sometimes) of the visit and manages to organize it into HPI and a/p VERY accurately and in better detail than what I would normally do without it. It also does physical exam and other things like patient instructions but you’d need to speak out the physical exam which is weird. It has been life changing because it takes away the mental burden of documenting after seeing patients. I often do all my notes at lunch and then after the afternoon session because it allows me to stay on time and focus on the patient. Knowing all the details are being captured and all I need to do is organize the note a little is FANTASTIC. It requires so much less brain power than formulating the note and truly does it so well.\n\nCurrently offered by my practice but it’s 400 a month which is pricey.

These are the ones on my radar:\n\n- I have heard good things about Freed, but haven’t tried them. Their website doesn’t do a good job of showing off the potential, so I’m not sure why so many have tried it.\n- I have tried Nabla, and it seems great for the HPI section of a psychiatric intake, if you don’t mind it excluding some details. The problem is the option to add custom instructions isn’t very robust and prevents you from, say, adding a template and having the AI fill it out. It’s free to try out and easy to sign up.\n- I have heard people talk highly about Lindy AI, and it apparently can be used to automate more of your workflow than just note writing. Their CEO apparently has gotten in trouble for some shady things, but I’m very interested in trying them out.\n- Ambience Healthcare’s website had some sample transcriptions from their AI a few months ago, and I was very impressed. It’s on my radar to try soon\n- I wouldn’t recommend DeepScribe, as they historically marketed having your note ready only after several hours, which I believe is because they send the audio transcripts to employees for quality assurance, but maybe this has changed.\n- I wouldn’t recommend DeepCura. I didn’t like their UI and people have said they make it very difficult to cancel your subscription.\n- I wouldn’t recommend Amazon’s AWS Healthscribe since it’s very expensive compared to the competition.\n- Similarly, I suspect Nuance’s scribe is very expensive, as well.\n\nThere are other’s, like Suki ai, AutoScribe, iScribe, and more, but I have never heard anyone talk about these. I’m hoping r/Psychiatry can reach a consensus as to the clear favorite, but we’re not there yet. If I had to recommend some to try, I would go with the first four I mentioned.\n\n### Comment ID kt1kk1q with +7 score by [(Xvi_G, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1kk1q/) (in reply to ID kt1k11a):\nThank you\n\nI'm pretty sure it was your (this) specific response that I most wanted to revisit form the old post\n\n### Comment ID kt37dto with +2 score by [(pickyvegan, Reddit, 2024-03-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt37dto/) (in reply to ID kt1k11a):\nDeepScribe has changed- your note is ready almost immediately now.\n\n### Comment ID l0krb3x with +1 score by [(Proper_Parking_2461, Reddit, 2024-04-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/l0krb3x/) (in reply to ID kt1k11a):\nI’ve been using Twofold and its been really doing the job.

It costs me about 25 cents to do a progress note and 75 cents to do an evaluation.  I predict the costs to come down even more in the future.  Not having to type anymore during appointments - priceless.  I have arthritis in my hands so I could not stand the constant banging on the keyboard all day. It is also better because I can pay more attention to my patients and less to my keyboard.  I think my bill to Microsoft cognitive services (GPT-4 calls) is like $40-50/mo.\n\nIt also does after visit summaries for the patient. I also told it the APA criteria for CPT coding, so it helps me with that as well.\n\nMicrosoft does a BAA with everyone and says their implementation of GPT-4 is HIPAA compliant.  That being said, I don't put patients' last names into GPT-4, to keep the data somewhat deidentified.  I tried to get a BAA with OpenAI, who ignored all my messages, and I went down the rathole trying to encrypt all the PHI in the transcript, then decrypt the output.  Although it was a mistake, I did create a wonderful and effective LLM tool for automatically deidentifying and reidentifying healthcare information, though.\n\nIt works great, listens to all my patients appointments and churns out notes in the background while I work.  At the end of the day, there are my notes.  The quality of the notes is excellent. All must be proofread because the AI does occasionally make a mistake.\n\nI haven't had much luck getting it to diagnose patients or create treatment plans, not that I would trust it for such a thing, but I had some initial hopes for creating an \"AI colleague\", which were dashed.  It will scribe whatever I said to the patient during the appointment, but it doesn't seem to have any thinking or reasoning ability of its own. It is wonderful at organizing and summarizing information, though.\n\nI'm fulltime clinical, so it took me about 3 months of tinkering in my spare time to get something workable. I am a bit rusty, and had to get up to speed on all the new technology as well as teach myself Python.\n\nMy malpractice carrier advised me to get and document verbal approval from patients. After hearing about it, all except 1 said yes. She took some introductory LLM class and didn't seem to understand the technology very well, just enough to be scared of it.\n\nI have some colleagues who are working on a product called Berries ([berries.icu](https://berries.icu)). We have basically created the same sort of software independently, but they are productizing it and have it open beta right now.  The cost is reasonable and I saw a demo that seemed promising.\n\n### Comment ID ktez3qq with +1 score by [(radiostar1899, Reddit, 2024-03-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/ktez3qq/) (in reply to ID kt2y1rx):\nI also prefer to do a \"homebrew\" solution.

Berries is the best thing I've seen yet in the commercial space for psychiatrists.\n\nI have CAP/MPT. The rep I spoke to seemed well aware of AI technology and had an answer ready for me.  At the end of the day, the note is still my note, and I'm responsible for its contents the same as ever, regardless of what computer tools I used to help put it together for me.\n\nI use Microsoft Azure because they gave me a BAA and they also claim their GPT-4 implementation is HIPAA compliant. ChatGPT is not HIPAA compliant regardless of whether or not they use data for training - don't ever put your patient data into Chat GPT.  I also don't put patient last names, addresses, birthdays, phone numbers, or other nonessential PHI etc into GPT-4, in order to maintain patient privacy even more. There are no laws or even regulations about this technology, but I am satisfied with the patient privacy precautions I've taken.\n\nMy state is a 2 party consent state for recording of electronic communications, so I need to document consent for that. Not that I would record my patient interviews without their consent. I don't know that you specifically need consent to share PHI with a partner for whom you have a BAA, but I do also explain the LLM technology to my patients and get their consent for it.\n\nIt was impractical to scribe a psych eval until OpenAI came out with the gpt4-32k model. Most evals are 10000+ tokens and won't fit into the 8k window gpt4 had. You could sometimes use gpt-3.5 with the 16k window, but even that was too small sometimes, and the results were not as good. These days, we have gpt4-turbo, which has a 128k token window and can handle anything I throw at it, for much less $/token to boot.\n\n### Comment ID m05kb5s with +1 score by [(Technical_Catch3880, Reddit, 2024-12-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/m05kb5s/) (in reply to ID kt2y1rx):\nThank you for this.

So far have used both MDHub and Nabla\n\nMDHub has an app that uses your phone mic, and keeps recording of your screen is off or of you switch out of the app. That's a small thing but it has a big impact on convenience of the recording. Particularly if you are working with a low talker.\n\nNabla seemed to have the slight edge in regards to the final formatting of the intake note, but I should note that I only used them utilizing their own standard formatting. I did not utilize any template other than just noting it as a new session and recording\n\nEither way, I found that for me (at this point) my best option was pasting THAT note to Chatgpt, uploading a word doc that has my tight intake format, and dictating some of my own observations that wouldn't have been transcribed from an intake note (MSE, general assessment and differential, some intangibles, etc)\n\nI also can tell chatgpt the tone I am seeking (clinical, narrative-driven, symptom focused, etc) and get a pretty good final product\n\nIt's a developing workflow that still needs  a lot of tweaking but it makes for a pretty solid final note. And while this would be too much effort for a med check, it's been a huge time saver and burnout protection for my 90 minute CAP intake evals\n\n### Comment ID kt1lrpb with +14 score by [(zpacksnackpack, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1lrpb/) (in reply to ID kt196a7):\nSounds like a great workflow! \n\nOne thing I’d note is Chat GPT is not HIPAA complaint (unless you have the super expensive enterprise version). \n\nBastion GPT is a great HIPAA compliant version you may want to check out it.\n\n#### Comment ID kt1q0ht with +8 score by [(Xvi_G, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1q0ht/) (in reply to ID kt1lrpb):\nThat's good to know about the alternate option\n\nFwiw I don't have any identifying info in my notes\n\nThat's all attached later via epic dot phrases\n\nBut certainly good to keep in mind\n\n## Comment ID kt1gj47 with +7 score by [(touchfuzzygetlit, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1gj47/) (in reply to ID 1b4uvub):\nI used FreedAI but it’s expensive like $100/month\n\n### Comment ID kt1o3nm with +2 score by [(DekkuRen, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1o3nm/) (in reply to ID kt1gj47):\nWhat do you think of it?\n\n#### Comment ID kt1qqzr with +9 score by [(colored_water, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1qqzr/) (in reply to ID kt1o3nm):\nI use freed and I love it.

There are great reviews about DocVilla's customer service as well.\n\nBefore I pull the trigger and sign the contract with DocVilla, anyone has any comments, experience, suggestions based on my needs.\n\n## Comment ID ljw7rfo with +4 score by [(Best_Doctor_MD90, Reddit, 2024-08-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthIT/comments/1euj8v0/docvilla_vs_athena_vs_ecw_vs_kareo_vs_advancedmd/ljw7rfo/) (in reply to ID 1euj8v0):\nThank you all who responded and helped me to decide on the right EHR. I signed the contract with DocVilla and I am extremely happy with them.\n\n1. DocVilla is super fast and completely web and cloud based EHR. I have tried it on Mac, Windows laptop and iPad. It works without any issues and without any VPN downloads. I was able to create 3 locations and assign providers to each location.\n\n2. The Telemedicine works out of the box. It automatically sends a link to the patient when a telehealth consult is created. It's a no brainer.\n\n3. DocVilla does have a free patient portal. But they are working on a custom patient portal for us which will take some time for development. But they understand our needs for branding and connecting with our website.\n\n4. Texting, Messaging works out of the box. So we are able to send text messages to the patients and are also able to message the patients on patient portal.\n\n5. DocVilla will be doing our billing. They will start the enrollment process. We have to provide them the payer IDs.\n\n6. DocVilla has got ton of prebuilt templates. I was also able to create templates myself using macros. I have also asked their engineering to create a few more templates for us. They are even open to any workflow customization that we might need.\n\n7. DocVilla has its own proprietary speech to text. From what I have tested so far, its very accurate. It works on Mac, Windows and iPad.\n\n8. Inventory management is prebuilt in DocVilla. I have seen the videos and it seems easy but have not yet used it.\n\n9. eRx and EPCS worked out of the box. Already tested sending prescriptions.\n\n10. The most important thing, the customer service is super responsive. It's Sunday today. I had emailed them a question in the morning. Within a few mins I got a response from DocVilla with screenshot explanation.\n\n  \nI am glad I found DocVilla EHR and made the right decision. I would highly recommend DocVilla to anyone looking for all-in-one EHR software solution.\n\n  \nI also came to know that DocVilla also offers marketing (Google, FB, Insta), Website development services. I have not yet taken a quote from them. But its great if a single company is acting as a one stop shop for the practices. I have scheduled a call with them next week to understand these ancillary technology and marketing services.\n\n### Comment ID lt1jbf0 with +2 score by [(Soggy-Phone-6391, Reddit, 2024-10-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthIT/comments/1euj8v0/docvilla_vs_athena_vs_ecw_vs_kareo_vs_advancedmd/lt1jbf0/) (in reply to ID ljw7rfo):\nOur practice has used all of the EMR's listed and we really like DocVilla. \n\nKareo used to be great, they are now the WORST! \n\n  \nGood luck with your practice :) I do medical billing coding credentialing and licensing if you ever need help feel free to reach out. \n\n[Lynchpracticemanagement@gmail.com](mailto:Lynchpracticemanagement@gmail.com)\n\n### Comment ID lk7e33o with +1 score by [(mmohiuddinkhan, Reddit, 2024-08-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthIT/comments/1euj8v0/docvilla_vs_athena_vs_ecw_vs_kareo_vs_advancedmd/lk7e33o/) (in reply to ID ljw7rfo):\nIt’s awesome to hear that you’re happy with your choice!

I was trained on DocVilla. I can also schedule training with them anytime I want from within the EHR using a Calendly link. DocVilla also has a huge knowledge base (videos as well as how to do wiki). They do not charge anything for training and its unlimited. Not sure about online but they are part of a bigger technology company in New York. Maybe DocVilla is smaller than Athena or eCW or Kareo, but I would rather stick with a company where the customer service responds rather than have a big company where the customer service is MIA or the engineering cannot customize for my needs.\n\nOverall, DocVilla is not complicated. It's easy to navigate which makes sense e.g. Add a patient and create a consult. There is some setup needed for templates which was explained during training and is also there in the videos.\n\n## Comment ID lk1b70t with +3 score by [(Nerd_Doctor, Reddit, 2024-08-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthIT/comments/1euj8v0/docvilla_vs_athena_vs_ecw_vs_kareo_vs_advancedmd/lk1b70t/) (in reply to ID 1euj8v0):\nI see that you already started using DocVilla.

We have a custom patient portal as well through DocVilla that is connected with our website and DocVilla did a phenomenal job. Their customer service is outstanding. Interface is easy to understand.

DocVilla EHR delivered whatever they promised. My custom patient portal is also done which they promised will be delivered after labor day weekend.

Would love to connect after you select a EMR/EHR\n\n I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers. Full HIPAA compliance and patient information is protected.\n* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.\n* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.\n* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.\n* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.\n* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.\n* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.\n* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.\nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more!

I keep seeing a few companies advertising AI scribe software and claims they can have their AI create a medical note from an encounter on the fly. Obviously, companies will always make their stuff sound better than it is so was just curious if anyone has used this and what they thought. I would love to have >90% of my chart done before I leave the room and just edit them at the end of the day as opposed to writing full notes.

I have shit to do and I’m not digging through the chart to try to figure out what you want from me. I’m going to write a one-liner note that says, “Unclear reason for consult.

Generally impressed. If they plan to continue exposing it to new data, it should get better with time. \n\nI think it’s important to keep in mind that the more structured your conversation is, the more structured the note will be. If you go back and forth between diagnoses it would make it more difficult for even a human scribe. \n\nIn settings of more multipurpose AI like GPT4 there is a position evolving called a prompt engineer. Someone who studies the impact of how queries are structured. We cannot control what the patient says, but we can gently direct them to give  us the info we need. Sometimes.",

The only thing you mentioned that could be long enough to need to retrieve from is the patient’s full medical records. But if your goal is to generate personalized treatments plans, etc. then you’re probably going to need to consolidate that information so the LLM can understand it holistically, rather than just retrieve from it.\n\nI’d start by thinking through what all your prompts should look like, and what information the LLM is going to need to have access to for each of them. If you find a step in the process where that key information can’t all fit into the prompt, then you can consider RAG solutions. At that point you’ll have a much clearer idea of what the RAG problem looks like, and in turn what the solution will need to look like.\n\n## Comment ID ldt3rl5 with +3 score by [(muditjps, Reddit, 2024-07-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1e6bic0/how_can_i_create_medical_rag_chatbot/ldt3rl5/) (in reply to ID 1e6bic0):\nI tried LLMs for a use-case around biotech research. Based on that I strongly feel that LLMs currently lack the ability to properly comprehend nuanced medical contexts. And, I'm not even talking about RAG. Besides, medical knowledge evolves and LLMs are still a blackbox to be trusted for crucial aspects such as treatment plans. \n\nThink it this way, would you make financial investments purely based on an LLM. \n\nSo first off I think ideation can be refined. In my opinion, it's better if this implemented for specific aspects. For example, there's a Paris based startup (Nabla) that automates writing of clinical notes. \n\nHowever, should you still look at technical aspects of this: \n\n1. **For RAG pipeline:** pick something that is easy to use with incremental updates. i.e. you're not dealing with a static data source but one which needs an evolving data source. Pathway is an open source option for it. [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pathwaycom/llm-app).   \n  \n2. **For improving accuracy**: Yes, you'll need something like Hybrid Indexes or at least metadata based filtering to retrieve better results. Accuracy is paramount in these cases. Most frameworks can do the job. Here are a couple of resources that I find useful:\n\n* [Metadata filtering + Vector search example](https://github.com/pathwaycom/llm-app/tree/main/examples/pipelines/slides_ai_search)\n* [Keyword + Vector search example with BM25 (quite a short video)](https://youtu.be/lYxGYXjfrNI)\n* I also checked and liked the resource shared by u/thanghaimeow!\n\n### Comment ID ldt5tyu with +3 score by [(FigureClassic6675, Reddit, 2024-07-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1e6bic0/how_can_i_create_medical_rag_chatbot/ldt5tyu/) (in reply to ID ldt3rl5):\nThank you for this brief explanation.\n\n### Comment ID ldvyp5d with +1 score by [(dontpushbutpull, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1e6bic0/how_can_i_create_medical_rag_chatbot/ldvyp5d/) (in reply to ID ldt3rl5):\nTo illustrate the point a bit more:\n\nSome time ago i wrote a lengthy technical onboarding material.

Developing a medical chatbot with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities can provide highly personalized and accurate recommendations. For your project, consider exploring open-source frameworks like LangChain for integrating RAG pipelines and Hugging Face's Transformers for fine-tuning medical-specific LLMs. You can also look into datasets like MIMIC-III for healthcare-related information, ensuring your chatbot is trained on reliable, de-identified data.\n\nAdditionally, implementing robust data privacy and compliance features (like HIPAA compliance) will be crucial to handling sensitive medical information securely. Best of luck with your project—it has the potential to make a real difference in personalized healthcare!",

I wanted to reach out regarding HIPAA compliant, AI automation tools that assists your providers with clinical documentation.\n\n* **Help providers create consistent, high quality documentation**\n* **Utilizing our AI to maximize $/encounter through smart ICD10 + CPT coding**\n* **Provide providers more perks to tackle labor shortages, turnover, and burnout**\n* **Create unlimited templates and custom rulesets to generate a note exactly how you want**\n* **An efficient write back into any web-based EHR system (athena, eClinicalWorks, webPT and many others)**\n\n* Feedback from a Provider: “Love the reduction in how much time we have to spend looking at a computer. Just the exhaustion in my eyes causes burnout and without having to stare at a computer all day - along with the emotional energy it takes, made the job really tough.”\n* ‘It’s one of the first times ever when a patient tells you a breakthrough or pivotal information where the knee jerk reaction isn’t to immediately look at the computer and document that. Everything is so much more fresh and the notes are much more specific in regard to each session which really allows for the authenticity of what’s happening in the sessions to be captured.’\n\nWhether from a clinical or business perspective, the goal is to make documentation more efficient so that you can see more patients and increase top line revenue.\n\n[**Schedule some time or reach out at ernest.chan@getathelas.com**](https://hello.athelas.com/c/ernest_chan#/select-time)\n\n*-* [*Athelas Scribe Testimonial Video*](https://hello.athelas.com/api/mailings/click/PMRGSZBCHIZTSNRRGQZSYITVOJWCEORCNB2HI4DTHIXS65TJNVSW6LTDN5WS6OBYG4YDGMJWHEYSELBCN5ZGOIR2EIZWKZTCGYYTIMZNGFSDCOJNGRRTKMJNMIYGKNBNMY4WCZBZHA2DOMTCMJSCELBCOZSXE43JN5XCEORCGQRCYITTNFTSEORCIMWVQVDLI54TC4DGIVMUIMLUHFCXUVCYNZEEKRBZMRVTE4RQJZJEGUKSOREEE22PLA2GOPJCPU======)\n\n*-* [*Athelas Scribe Demo*](https://hello.athelas.com/api/mailings/click/PMRGSZBCHIZTSNRRGQZSYITVOJWCEORCNB2HI4DTHIXS65TJNVSW6LTDN5WS6OJUGIYTIMBVGQ4SELBCN5ZGOIR2EIZWKZTCGYYTIMZNGFSDCOJNGRRTKMJNMIYGKNBNMY4WCZBZHA2DOMTCMJSCELBCOZSXE43JN5XCEORCGQRCYITTNFTSEORCKBXVATTIK5DGORCZK54HSYKLMRQVC5K7JVLXS4JWIMZUGRKKGRHUKQ2DPJZWEWKYJZTGOPJCPU======)\n\n*-* [*Athelas EHR Integration with Scribe*](https://hello.athelas.com/api/mailings/click/PMRGSZBCHIZTSNRRGQZSYITVOJWCEORCNB2HI4DTHIXS65TJNVSW6LTDN5WS6OJUGIYTINRVGUYSELBCN5ZGOIR2EIZWKZTCGYYTIMZNGFSDCOJNGRRTKMJNMIYGKNBNMY4WCZBZHA2DOMTCMJSCELBCOZSXE43JN5XCEORCGQRCYITTNFTSEORCMRCXIMZXGNYWUZCNKBRGKQ2WGJLFGVKUJBJUKMDQIVYXEZBSIZKXIUDKMR4S2WTROZ2EKPJCPU======)\n\n*-* [*Athelas Intake Features Demo*](https://hello.athelas.com/api/mailings/click/PMRGSZBCHIZTSNRRGQZSYITVOJWCEORCNB2HI4DTHIXS653XO4XGY33PNUXGG33NF5ZWQYLSMUXTQNTBMMYTOMDGGUYWENBUGIYDQOBXHAYTAMZZGNSTGNLDGVRGKNJ7ONUWIPJRGVQWEYJVMQZS2NBYGRSS2NBWG44S2YRYMM3S2OBXGA3TONRZMY4DSZBVEIWCE33SM4RDUIRTMVTGENRRGQZS2MLEGE4S2NDDGUYS2YRQMU2C2ZRZMFSDSOBUG4ZGEYTEEIWCE5TFOJZWS33OEI5CENBCFQRHG2LHEI5CEU2VGRJW6QRYIJAUCQJRJYZHMRDYNRRWE6SFIM4DIYJWJ5WWUQLTONQTEWKZFUWVIMK7JU6SE7I=)\n\n*-* [*Customized Formatting Demo*](https://hello.athelas.com/api/mailings/click/PMRGSZBCHIZTSNRRGQZSYITVOJWCEORCNB2HI4DTHIXS653XO4XGY33PNUXGG33NF5ZWQYLSMUXTKMBWGIZDKMJZMQ2TINJUMNRDEYTFGAZDEOJYGU2DAMZTGQ4WKNZCFQRG64THEI5CEM3FMZRDMMJUGMWTCZBRHEWTIYZVGEWWEMDFGQWWMOLBMQ4TQNBXGJRGEZBCFQRHMZLSONUW63RCHIRDIIRMEJZWSZZCHIRHCURQIRXWE2TGGZFVQY2PNZWUS4DGN5HUWRKTKNDXCNLJGRHUESBVKNEEGULQJBKWQUKFHURH2===)\n\n## Comment ID lblehyi with +1 score by [(BubblySass143, Reddit, 2024-07-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1dsa1e1/does_anyone_have_any_experience_with_ai_scribes/lblehyi/) (in reply to ID 1dsa1e1):\nI’ve used DAX since 2022.

I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers. Full HIPAA compliance and patient information is protected.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more! You can also shoot me an email ernest.chan@getathelas.com and I'd be happy to chat more.\n\n## Comment ID kw8cvoa with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pediatrics/comments/196hyb4/seeking_info_about_ai_scribes/kw8cvoa/) (in reply to ID 196hyb4):\nTry infoseek.ai - $12/mo for 10 hours.

Nabla expanded its AI-powered clinical documentation to support additional languages beyond the existing English (US), English (UK), French, and Spanish. The enhancement aims to assist a broader range of physicians who care for patients in various languages, including regional dialects and variations. By introducing these new language options, Nabla hopes to help bridge the language barrier for the 66 million people who do not speak English as their primary language. Nabla now supports 35 international languages.\n\nExam room language barriers negatively impact the patient-physician relationship, causing confusion, distrust in physicians, a low rate of patient compliance, and poor health outcomes. At the same time, physicians who provide care in multiple languages require expanded access to AI-powered documentation tools that lead to greater efficiency and overall improved patient outcomes. Ineffective communication also has financial implications, where medical errors related to language barriers cost health systems up to $80 billion annually nationwide.\n\n\"Supporting physicians with AI assistants like ours that enhance clinical documentation regardless of the language spoken bridges a gap in care delivery and drives forward health equity initiatives,\" said Delphine Groll, co-founder and COO, Nabla. \"By expanding the languages Nabla captures, we're advancing care delivery by allowing providers to remain focused on building rapport and trust with the patient and improving the patient experience by generating clear, concise language-specific details and instructions.\"\n\nIn July 2023, Nabla was the first ambient AI assistant to launch a Spanish-language version to support physician-patient conversations. California-based health systems, including Children's Hospital Los Angeles, quickly adopted the Spanish-language version, which is used in 8% of the visits conducted with Nabla. Nabla listened closely to its customers and prospects when determining which new language versions to create. For example, prospects and clients based on the West Coast frequently requested Chinese language support to improve communications with their patient population that speaks Chinese languages. All new language versions account for the top languages spoken in the U.S.\n\nNabla's generative AI ambiently produces real-time comprehensive clinical notes in the background during physician-patient conversations. The platform also has multi-speaker functionality to ensure guardians and parents are captured when present during the exam. Switching to a different language within Nabla is simple; the provider chooses the specific language before the start of a consultation, and Nabla uses its powerful ambient AI to create detailed clinical notes in English and patient instructions in the selected language. Providing patient instructions in their preferred language improves patient engagement and treatment adherence, increases trust in the healthcare industry, and ultimately better patient health outcomes.\n\nAbout Nabla\n\nNabla is the leading ambient AI assistant, reducing practitioner stress and improving patient care. Nabla produces AI-generated clinical notes in seconds from any encounter across all specialties. Powered by proprietary LLMs, fine-tuned to the medical field, Nabla's capabilities include AI-enabled medical coding identification and smooth EHR integrations.\n\nThe company's leadership includes: Alex Lebrun (CEO), with over two decades of experience building AI products, and whose companies have been acquired by Nuance (VirtuOz) and Facebook (Wit.ai); Delphine Groll (COO) and Martin Raison (CTO). Ed Lee, MD, MPH, who was previously CIO at The Permanente Federation, recently joined Nabla as Chief Medical Officer. He heads Nabla's Clinical Advisory Board, formed by 20+ seasoned clinical leaders.\n\nOn the technological side, the company's advisors include Yann LeCun, VP & Chief AI Scientist at Meta, and Tony Fadell, inventor of the iPod and former Apple executive, among others.\n\nNabla has raised a total of $49M, its most recent fundraising being a $30M series B led by global venture capital firm Cathay Innovation.

      "# [Generative AI in the EHR: Powering NextGen® Ambient Assist & restoring clinician well](https://www.nabla.com/blog/gen-ai-ehr/)\nBack\n\nGenerative AI in the EHR: Powering NextGen® Ambient Assist & restoring clinician well-being\n\nJune 5, 2024·7 minute read\n\nBack in November Nabla announced an exciting integration with NextGen Healthcare, a leading provider of innovative, cloud-based healthcare solutions to power NextGen® Ambient Assist. NextGen Ambient Assist is a fully automated ambient listening solution that delivers clinical notes directly to NextGen Healthcare's electronic health record (EHR) platforms, significantly reducing clinical documentation time.\n\nNextGen Healthcare was one of the pioneers in embracing Generative AI, recognizing its potential to mitigate physician burnout and enhance the overall patient experience.\n\nGenerative AI in the EHR\n\nWhile widespread adoption of EHRs has undeniably improved care coordination, enhanced data accessibility, and streamlined diagnosis, it is also contributing to documentation fatigue and clinician burnout. According to a 2021 study from JAMIA, for every eight hours that office-based physicians have scheduled with patients, they spend more than five hours in the EHR. When it comes to clinical documentation, a study found that writing and reviewing notes takes up 78% of all physician interactions with EHRs. Challenges include data entry, interoperability, cluttered visual display, and diverting attention from patient care among others.\n\nThe emergence of Generative AI presents a myriad of opportunities to streamline various stages of the clinical workflow, spanning from clinical documentation and coding to clinical decision support and patient communication.\n\nNextGen Ambient Assist, powered by Nabla\n\nNabla has been integrated with NextGen Ambient Assist since October 2023, and is already available to nearly 5,000 users of the NextGen Mobile application. NextGen Ambient Assist uses the audio from patient encounters to automatically capture subjective, objective, assessment, and plan (SOAP) notes that help organize providers' observations. These notes are automatically presented in NextGen Mobile for provider review and editing before inclusion in the patient's EHR chart. NextGen Ambient Assist has been shown to save providers an average of 1.5 to 2 hours of documentation per day.\n\nIn an effort to address the national shortage of mental and behavioral health professionals, the company also recently announced it was making NextGen Ambient Assist available to psychiatrists and other practitioners in the behavioral health space.\n\nAs Nabla and NextGen Healthcare continue to work together to expand ambient AI capabilities in the EHR, we interviewed Jeremy Dixon, Vice President of Product Development at NextGen Healthcare to gain insights into the company’s perspective on our partnership.\n\nLet’s chat!\n\nKenza: What challenges and industry trends led NextGen Healthcare to seek out an integration with Nabla?\n\nJeremy: NextGen is committed to materially enhancing the care provider experience and are continuously evaluating opportunities to improve EHR usability and effectiveness. Several of our clients requested to prioritize addressing the documentation burden that weighs heavily on their providers, compelling them to devote extra hours at the clinic or stay up late completing documentation from the previous day. Besides being time consuming, existing live scribing and virtual scribing alternatives are also expensive and adversely impact providers’ ability to be more present with the patient during the encounter. We recognized the potential of AI to comprehensively address these challenges and sought out partners who were developing solutions in this space.\n\nKenza: Why was this a priority?\n\nJeremy: Timely access to care providers continues to be a significant challenge in the industry, even as physician shortages and clinician burnout are impacting the supply side of the equation. We prioritized this concern since it has the potential to not only significantly alleviate the documentation burden for providers directly, but to also unlock incremental clinical capacity which is advantageous to both patients and the financial sustainability of the practices we serve.\n\nKenza: What was NextGen Healthcare looking for in an ambient AI solution for clinical documentation?\n\nJeremy: We were looking for a partner that was collaborative in nature, with a track record of proven technology capable of addressing the problem in real-time through a fully tech-based solution. Further, we wanted to work with a partner who appreciates the many ethical and security concerns associated with AI usage in the care journey and had the appropriate controls and measures in place to ensure a safe and defensible care experience for our clients and patient communities.\n\nKenza: How did you find out about Nabla, and why did you choose to partner with us?\n\nJeremy: We found Nabla during our discovery work when vetting various ambient vendors. Nabla’s vision aligned with our mission to reduce provider documentation time and cognitive load while also meeting stringent standards for security and governance. Nabla’s technology stack is modern and extensible, and the engineering and product teams proved to be agile and highly responsive to our client’s evolving needs.\n\nKenza: What made our solution stand out over others that you researched?\n\nJeremy: The strength of the technical stack (API first), the alignment of mission and vision to make a positive impact with healthcare providers, and the overall leadership of the executive team at Nabla. Additionally, the speed at which the product continuously improves reflects a refreshing emphasis on clients’ needs and results-oriented growth model.\n\nKenza: What have you been most impressed with?\n\nJeremy: There are many areas that impressed us, but the one that stands out is Nabla’s commitment to understanding the problem space and willingness to engage our end customers to cultivate a deep understanding of their needs and requirements. The technology is capable of standing on its own merits but what differentiates this offering is its customer-centricity.\n\nKenza: What surprised you the most from working with the Nabla team? What’s it like working with us?\n\nJeremy: What stands out most is the exceptional collaboration we've experienced while working with Nabla. The strong focus on user feedback is evident in both the way the team swiftly resolves our clients’ queries, as well as their ability to integrate new innovations into the product rapidly and meet the evolving needs of clients.\n\nKenza: What kind of feedback have you heard from your clients using NextGen Ambient Assist?\n\nJeremy: Overall, our clients love it. They call it a “game-changing” solution. They say that it allows them to focus on the patient and saves them a lot of time on the backend. Since it is fully integrated within our EHR platform, many of our users have reported they no longer have to take “work” home and are enjoying a better work/life balance. One of our provider clients shared that a typical encounter plus documentation time can take under 10 minutes, so he was able to add five new patients a day. He also noted that it saves their practice money since it costs a lot less than having a virtual or live scribe.\n\nKenza: How has NextGen Ambient Assist benefited your company and business as a whole?\n\nJeremy: It has allowed us to take a significant step forward in how we support our clients as trusted partners. By re-imagining the provider experience and solving a real-world problem for our providers that positively impacts their experience while also enhancing care quality, access and practice sustainability we continue to live our vision of delivering better healthcare outcomes for all.\n\nKenza: How do you envision our partnership moving forward?\n\nJeremy: While the early returns from our partnership have been tremendous, we are focused on scaling the impact we believe we can deliver across our complete customer base. Further, we are taking the lessons from the real-world deployment of this AI solution into the EHR (i.e., reimagining clinical workflows, physician change management and training, adoption patterns etc.) to shape the next evolution of AI capabilities that will positively impact the provider and patient experience.\n\n–\n\nNabla offers multiple integration options, including a deep white label integration through API that allows EHRs to stay on brand.",

That makes AI ethics especially important in healthcare, where the decisions that are made can literally be life and death.\n\nThe Coalition for Health AI (CHAI) is a private-sector coalition committed to developing industry best practices and frameworks to address the need for independent validation for quality assurance, representation, and ethical practices for health AI. It's a coalition made up of leaders and experts representing health systems, startups, government and patient advocates, CHAI has established working groups focusing on privacy & security, fairness, transparency, usefulness, and safety of AI algorithms.\n\nNow CHAI has a new member, announcing that Nabla, an ambient AI assistant for clinicians, is joining the organization.\n\nNabla's product, Copilot, generates clinical notes in seconds; instead of having to type notes during consultations, clinicians can rely on Nabla Copilot to transcribe the entire encounter and generate an accurate clinical note that is directly integrated into the EHR. This allows providers to be entirely focused on patient care and to save an average of two hours per day which are usually spent on documentation. Benefits include reduced cognitive load from clerical burdens, less stress, and feelings of burnout. Copilot also automates the generation of patient instructions and referral letters.\n\nIn March, the company partnered with Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, and since then it has expanded to serves over 85 provider organizations and supports more than 45,000 clinicians across the U.S. It also signed new health system contracts with the University of Iowa Health Care and Carle Health, and tripled its adoption rate, increasing from 3 million visits annually at the start of 2024 to 9 million visits per year.\n\nAlex Lebrun, co-founder and CEO of Nabla, spoke to VatorNews about what's lacking when it comes to ethics in healthcare AI, his vision for what that looks like, and how CHAI will help it get there.\n\nVatorNews: Ethics in AI is a hot topic, and especially so in healthcare, where data needs to be secured and bias can literally be life and death. What do you see as some of the most important areas where you believe ethics are important in healthcare?\n\nAlex Lebrun: I think there are many ethical aspects to consider in healthcare AI, and we've heard directly from our health system partners about the importance of addressing these issues. Their feedback has been crucial in shaping our approach at Nabla, especially around key areas like bias, reliability, and transparency—each of which directly impacts patient care and clinician trust.\n\nBias: Bias in AI can lead to unequal predictions that impact patient outcomes, potentially widening disparities in care. For instance, to reduce language biases, we trained our proprietary speech-to-text models on over 50 different accents, minimizing the impact of voice characteristics on documentation accuracy.\n\nReliability: Clinicians need reliable AI tools that they can trust to keep patients safe. Our systems are designed to work within clear, defined scopes to reduce risks and maintain consistency. We’ve also implemented a proprietary framework that cross-checks documentation against transcripts and patient context, ensuring every fact is fully supported and verifiable.\n\nTransparency: Transparency is critical for fostering trust. At Nabla, we share our governance practices openly and collaborate without renowned institutions (CHAI, AMIA, CHIME and more) on industry standards to help build trust and confidence in our ambient AI assistant.\n\nVN: Is enough being done so far to ensure that AI in healthcare is being deployed responsibly? If not, what do you believe can and should be done?\n\nAL: While AI in healthcare holds immense potential, there’s still a long way to go to ensure its responsible deployment. Many healthcare organizations are proactively setting their own AI governance standards, but only a small fraction have fully developed strategies addressing critical ethical issues like bias and safety. Without a universal governance framework, many AI tools in healthcare lack comprehensive ethical evaluations. A 2024 McKinsey survey found that, while 70% of healthcare organizations believe they are prepared to integrate AI, only 30% have fully developed responsible AI strategies that address key ethical considerations. To bridge this gap, we believe healthcare organizations, developers, and policymakers must prioritize collaboration to establish clear, transparent, and standardized guidelines that can evolve alongside the technology.\n\nVN: What is your vision for an ethical framework for AI? How do you think we can ensure accuracy and confidentiality?\n\nAL: At Nabla, our vision for an ethical AI framework centers on transparency and trust with our clinician community. Our approach is grounded in three core pillars—privacy, reliability, and safety—reinforced by a blend of real-time model monitoring, clinician feedback, and safety features embedded directly into our product.\n\nTo ensure documentation accuracy, we have developed a proprietary framework through which each note produced is split into atomic facts, which are checked via an LLM query against the transcript and the patient context. Only facts for which we find definitive proof are considered valid. Moreover, each new model version undergoes rigorous review by professional medical human scribes to confirm the documentation is comprehensive and meets industry standards.\n\nAdditional safeguards include prompts for clinicians to review notes before exporting and an intuitive feedback tool for flagging any issues. We continuously monitor edits and feedback, gaining real-world insights that improve our model’s accuracy and reliability.\n\nConfidentiality is paramount at Nabla. We offer a flexible, customer-first data storage approach, allowing health systems to define their retention policies. The standard retention period is 14 days, customizable to as little as a few seconds or extended further if needed. We never store encounter audio, and customer data isn’t used for model training by default. Feedback is de-identified following HIPAA standards, and health systems have the option to contribute specific data for model improvement, with complete control over their information.\n\nVN: How did you first become involved with CHAI? What is it about the organization that made you want to join?\n\nAL: We got involved with the Coalition for Health AI because we recognized the positive impact they’re making in healthcare AI governance. We were particularly impressed by the valuable work CHAI has already accomplished, such as developing the Blueprint for Trustworthy AI Implementation Guidance and Assurance for Healthcare and releasing the draft Responsible Health AI Framework.\n\nAt Nabla, transparency has always been central to our approach. With our background as Machine Learning researchers, we value these intricate questions around governance and felt a responsibility to be part of the conversation. CHAI’s strong commitment to transparency and trust-building, along with the establishment of quality assurance labs, aligns closely with our mission. Joining CHAI lets us actively contribute to these essential discussions and work toward harmonizing AI standards across the industry.\n\nVN: What do you hope to accomplish by being a part of CHAI? What will you see as a win?\n\nAL: At Nabla, we've always placed our community of clinicians at the center of our work, building our product based on their feedback and needs. By joining CHAI, we hope to establish another valuable channel to stay connected to our ecosystem—allowing us to listen closely to clinicians' expectations, respond to their questions, and foster greater transparency and trust in healthcare AI. Right now, healthcare AI governance is fragmented, with many organizations developing their own frameworks. A win for the entire ecosystem would be achieving a more unified set of standards across the industry, making it easier for clinicians to understand, assess, and choose AI solutions that prioritize safety for clinicians and patients alike.\n\nVN: Is there anything else that I should know?\n\nAL: Nabla is moving toward becoming a proactive, real-time AI assistant that helps doctors make decisions on the spot. Thanks to solid partnerships and user trust, we’re ready to take this next big step. We are currently working on Active CDI to give instant feedback to clinicians during consultations, making sure their documentation meets coding standards and reduces claim denials.",

      "# [Nabla](https://www.nabla.bio/news/denovo)\nToday, we’re thrilled to share a major advance in our ability to design antibodies fully computationally. We developed a new AI protein design system, JAM, capable of designing high quality lead antibodies de novo given just a target protein sequence and/or structure. We thoroughly experimentally validated this new approach on a range of therapeutic applications and carefully studied the therapeutic properties of these de novo antibody designs.\n\nWhere we are today\n\nRecent advances in deep learning have revolutionized our ability to predict the structures of proteins and design proteins de novo. While these tools hold enormous promise for medicine, there has been relatively little progress in using them to develop viable drugs. Antibodies, as the most established drug format, are a great first real-world test for de novo drug design. However, so far no AI systems have shown they are able to produce high quality lead antibodies from scratch in a way that is robust and generalizes across protein targets and antibody formats.\n\nOur advance\n\nWe introduce a new AI system called Joint Atomic Modeling (JAM) and use it to design de novo antibodies with good affinity, epitope-specificity, and function. We show that our antibodies have strong developability and other drug-like properties with no optimization, making it possible to replace traditional discovery with de novo design for the first time.\n\nWe show generalizability across a diverse range of soluble targets with orders of magnitude higher hit rates compared to traditional discovery, including a protein target with no known structure in the PDB. Next, we apply JAM to a set of multipass membrane proteins, which as a class are considered difficult to drug, and show for the first time we can design antibodies against them from scratch, including the first computational designed binders, of any kind, against Claudin-4 (CLDN4) and the GPCR (CXCR7). When JAM is given time to “think” and introspect on its results, we see significantly improved success rates and affinities - echoing recent trends for large language models (LLMS) and teasing the exciting possibility of “test-time scaling laws” for protein design.\n\nOur technical report is the first demonstration of de novo antibody design relevant to therapeutic discovery and the first evidence of computationally designed antibodies that can target hard-to-drug membrane proteins including GPCRs.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nWhat implications does this have for the development of new drugs?\n\nUnlocking new target space\n\nMultipass membrane proteins, like GPCRs, are notoriously challenging. Our approach enables the design of antibodies that can not only drug these targets directly but also serve as precise tools for target validation and the exploration of new biology.\n\nIntractable targets—such as tight junction proteins, disordered proteins, and transiently stable complexes—cannot be produced reliably in recombinant form, making traditional antibody development difficult. By designing antibodies entirely in silico and with high hit-rates, we bypass the need for recombinant proteins and could even directly test for antibody function from the onset of the discovery process.\n\nFaster antibody development\n\nOur results show significant efficiency gains in experimental time result from the small library sizes enabled by JAM’s high hit-rates. Importantly, this accelerates the antibody development process whilst also cutting costs.\n\nExcitingly, epitope-specificity enabled by JAM addresses a key attrition point in traditional discovery campaigns, where antibodies often fail to target the desired epitope. This boost in specificity increases the likelihood of discovering functional leads and cuts down on wasted effort.\n\nPrecisely controllable antibody behavior\n\nSpecies cross-species reactivity requirements can be used to guide epitope selection, streamlining the preclinical development process.\n\nEngineered selectivity can similarly be selected for at the epitope level, generating antibodies that either (i) target multiple related proteins with desired binding profiles, or (ii) minimizing binding to closely-related family members and/or dangerous off-targets.\n\nResults\n\nJAM designed antibodies have good affinity, specificity, developability and function within therapeutic range and exhibit strong early stage developability without any experimental optimization.\n\nGood affinity - We designed de novo antibodies against 7 disclosed (SARS-CoV-2 RDB, HER2, IL-13, PD-1, TrkA, CLDN4, CXCR7) and 1 undisclosed protein target and saw that top designs achieved double-digit to single-digit nanomolar affinities that put them within therapeutic-range for a high quality lead antibody.\n\nSpecificity - Importantly, designs made from one target rarely bound another target, suggesting good specificity. Excitingly, three VHH designs we made to Claudin-4 were over 100x more selective for Claudin-4 than three other closely related off target Claudins (3, 6, & 9). Strong selectivity like the result we saw here is critical to ensuring therapeutic antibodies are safe and can be administered at high doses to achieve the maximum therapeutic impact.\n\nEarly stage developability - We evaluated early stage developability properties of our de novo antibodies and found expression levels, monomericity, and polyreactivity at or better than leading monoclonals (mAbs). These are promising indications that these designs will behave well in manufacturing and formulation, two important hurdles to clear for a commercially viable drug.\n\nFunction - We tested the functional activity of our de novo antibodies using target-specific functional assays. For SARS-CoV-2, we measured neutralization activity using a pseudovirus assay and saw IC50 values in the sub-nanomolar range (0.65 nM). We also use epitope mapping to confirm our designed antibodies bound to the desired functional sites, providing robust evidence of disease-relevant function.\n\nWe use JAM to develop the first computationally designed antibodies against multipass membrane proteins, achieving strong affinity, specificity and desired function. This has long been considered a ‘holy grail’ of antibody engineering but has not been previously reported.\n\nMembrane Protein Targeting - We demonstrate JAM's ability to target challenging multipass membrane proteins by designing antibodies against two therapeutic targets: claudin-4 (CLDN4) and the GPCR CXCR7. To enable efficient screening of large design libraries against these membrane-bound targets, we leveraged JAM's general protein design capabilities to create soluble protein proxies (solMPMPs) that preserve the native extracellular epitopes while enabling solution-phase characterization.\n\nFor both targets, this soluble proxy strategy proved successful. Selected antibodies showed high-affinity binding to their native targets expressed on engineered cell lines, with maintained specificity. Notably, CLDN4-targeting antibodies also demonstrated binding to OVCAR3 cells, an ovarian cancer line expressing endogenous CLDN4, validating their potential therapeutic relevance. These results represent the first demonstration that computational design can generate antibodies against this historically challenging but therapeutically crucial target class.\n\nJAM shows strong signs of generalization, including to novel targets not in the training set, and demonstrates early evidence of test-time scaling laws. We show how using JAM to design experimental libraries further improves performance and compresses design and affinity optimization into a single experimental step.\n\nStrong Generalization - JAM demonstrated broad generalization across multiple dimensions of antibody design. We validated its capabilities on diverse targets by generating both single-domain antibodies (VHHs) and full-length monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), achieving comparable affinity and function across formats. Notably, JAM successfully designed high-affinity, specific antibodies to a novel target absent from the PDB, indicating genuine generalization beyond training data.\n\nScaling test-time compute - A particularly exciting finding emerged when allowed JAM to introspect on its outputs and perform multiple rounds of iterative design at inference time. By increasing these computational iterations, we observed substantial improvements: 3-fold higher success rates, 10-fold better affinities, and unexpectedly, greater structural diversity - all while maintaining developability and humanness. This previously unobserved relationship between test-time compute and protein design success warrants investigation into the best way to allocate compute between training and inference to maximize experimental success.\n\nOne-Shot Affinity Optimization - We further enhanced JAM's capabilities by combining computational design with focused experimental sampling. Using error-prone PCR to explore sequence neighborhoods around JAM-designed binders, we achieved up to 100-fold improvements in affinity, reaching picomolar binding strengths. This hybrid approach effectively compressed de novo design and affinity optimization into a single experimental step, significantly streamlining the discovery process.\n\nLimitations\n\nThere are a few things we're working on to improve JAM and to better deliver on the promise of de novo antibody design:",

      "# [News: AI tool for hospitals fabricates text in transcription, researchers say](https://acdis.org/articles/news-ai-tool-hospitals-fabricates-text-transcription-researchers-say)\nAmidst the many artificial intelligence (AI) tools introduced to improve documentation accuracy, one version of the AI-powered transcription tool called Whisper is being used by over 30,000 clinicians and 40 health systems to translate and transcribe patients’ consultations with doctors, MedPage Today reported. This tool built by Nabla is intended to free up medical providers to spend less time on notetaking or report writing, and it’s estimated to have been used to transcribe seven million medical visits.\n\nWhisper’s creator, OpenAI, has cautioned that the tool should not be used in “high-risk domains,” however, and three different researchers who conducted studies of the tool’s audio transcriptions found the tool is prone to making up chunks of text and even entire sentences.\n\nOne researcher from the University of Michigan told MedPage Today that he found such invented text—known in the tech industry as “hallucinations”—in eight out of every 10 audio transcriptions. A machine learning engineer analyzed over 100 hours of the Whisper transcriptions and discovered hallucinations in about half of them. A third developer said he created 26,000 transcripts with Whisper and found hallucinations in almost every one. While transcription tools are expected to misspell words and make other errors, engineers and researchers said they haven’t seen another AI-powered transcription tool hallucinate as often as Whisper.\n\nSome of the text can include racial commentary, violent rhetoric, and imagined medical treatments, experts have warned. For instance, in one transcription, Whisper invented a non-existent medication called “hyperactivated antibiotics.” Software developers said these tend to occur amid pauses, background sounds, or music playing. Unfortunately, Nabla's chief technology officer Martin Raison says it’s impossible to compare their tool’s AI-generated transcript to the original recording, because Nabla's tool erases the original audio for “data safety reasons.”\n\nParticularly in hospital settings, such mistakes could have “really grave consequences,” said Alondra Nelson, PhD, who led the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy until last year.\n\n“This seems solvable if the company is willing to prioritize it,” said William Saunders, a San Francisco-based research engineer. Earlier this year, he quit OpenAI over concerns with the company's direction. “It's problematic if you put this out there and people are overconfident about what it can do and integrate it into all these other systems.”\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson told MedPage Today that the company continually studies how to reduce hallucinations and appreciated the researchers' findings. They added that OpenAI incorporates feedback in model updates.",

Healthcare Innovation recently spoke with Matt Keefer, M.D., chief medical informatics officer at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles about the results of a pilot project involving Nabla Copilot.\n\nKeefer is a member of the Department of General Pediatrics at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and a clinical professor in the Department of Pediatrics at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.\n\nNabla Copilot is also in use at The Permanente Medical Group, Mankato Clinic, Frontier Psychiatry, and others.\n\nAlthough based in Paris, Nabla is focused on the U.S. healthcare market. Founded in 2018, the company has proprietary large language models and speech-to-text technologies built by former Facebook AI Research engineers.\n\nHCI: Could you talk a little bit about some of the EHR challenges your organization has had — and that hospitals in general have — that make something like Nabla’s ambient AI assistant attractive? Are there burnout issues related to EHR documentation you wanted to address?\n\nKeefer: I think I can safely say that no one went into medicine with the intent of documenting. That brings very little joy to anybody's work day. With the expansion of the EMR, there are some wonderful things, including 100 percent availability of the chart to those who need it. There are also some downsides, which involve a lot more typing, and especially for clinicians who aren't super tech-savvy, it means a lot of interaction with the system that they think is sometimes a barrier between them and their patients.\n\nHCI: There are several companies entering this ambient AI assistant space. How did your organization decide which one to work with? What drew you to Nabla?\n\nKeefer: We certainly did look around at some of the different options. One of the things that really drew us to Nabla was the responsiveness of the team, the interest in improving the product with us and being able to understand how our clinicians were interacting with the patients. In particular, we have a fairly large percentage of our patients and families who speak languages other than English, Spanish being the predominant one. They were very open to understanding that workflow, and trying to ensure that we could could be as as efficient as possible with that.\n\nHCI: You conducted a pilot with 30 pediatric specialists. What are some things you had to tailor specifically for the pediatric hospital setting?\n\nKeefer: We have surgical subspecialties, medical subspecialties, and general pediatrics, and clearly those all have slightly different variations in terms of how their visits go. We also deliberately chose people in different parts of their career — senior faculty, junior faculty, those who are tech-savvy, those who weren’t, and some who were already using things for dictation. We worked with the general pediatricians to come up with a better template for keeping track of information that you would have in a typical well-child exam. Nabla was able to respond to specific requests for how to format the note in a way that would be germane to a pediatrician.\n\nHCI: What about integration with your Oracle Cerner EHR? Is that something that came right out of the box, or did you have to do some work on that?\n\nKeefer: I would say that no integration comes without some work. Certainly, that was one of the other things that we really enjoyed working with Nabla on. We came up with workflows that worked for integration with Oracle Health, and the team from Nabla had already been connected with them, and we're working on on the next steps to further that integration.\n\nHCI: Were there things that you wanted to measure during the pilot in terms of doctor-patient interactions or clinician time spent documenting to see some improvement before moving on to a larger implementation?\n\nKeefer: We did. We have Oracle Health data to look at time documenting after hours and things like that. We also did structured questionnaires with all the pilot users, and the Nabla team has them rate the notes to give them feedback on on the quality of the notes and what needed to be changed.\n\nHCI: Do you feel positive enough now that you're going to roll it out organization-wide?\n\nKeefer: Yes. We’re hoping to start that up with a group of 27 pediatricians next week. We also want to try use cases outside of just the physicians. So we're working with social workers and some other team members, such as psychologists — anybody who has a narrative experience with the patient.\n\nAlso joining the conversation were Nabla CEO and co-founder Alex Lebrun and Chief Medical Officer Ed Lee, M.D.\n\nHCI: Dr. Lee, tell us about your background and how you came to Nabla?\n\nLee: I am an internal medicine primary care physician. I've been with Nabla as the chief medical officer officially for about three weeks now, but I've actually been working with Nabla for quite some time. I previously served as the chief information officer for the Permanente Federation, which is sort of a consulting advisory body to the Permanente Medical Group. I was in that role for about five years and with Kaiser Permanente for over 20 years as a practicing clinician and I still practice there now.\n\nIn the pilot work that we did with Nabla early on at Permanente, we actually did see a decrease in time in charting anywhere from 25 to 30 percent within each particular encounter. If you’ve got 20-plus encounters per day, that adds up to a couple hours per day.\n\nHCI: What are some things that distinguish Nabla from the competitors entering this space?\n\nLebrun: I think the fact that we start from physicians, from the users, and go bottom up is a very, very big differentiation. We push our product directly to physicians. Actually, there is a free version that they can use for free for up to 30 encounters per month. And then they become our champions. So we start to have users inside the organizations and they become our champions and eventually, we have enterprise contracts.\n\nThat has big consequences, because since we designed the product to be self-service, you should understand it in two minutes by yourself without any training. Otherwise these bottom-up approaches don't work. So it is very easy to deploy. This is one of the differences.\n\nSomething else is we recognized from the start that every organization has different processes. I've never met two physicians who agree on what is a best note. So we know we need to customize. It's more like a platform that we need to customize for every customer. For instance, pediatrics was very different for us because there are maybe two parents, two children and one interpreter in the room. It's very complicated. We had never seen that before. But we could adapt the product in a few weeks to support that. We don't see this as an off-the-shelf product, but more as a platform that we can very quickly adapt to every customer. So we think this makes us a little bit different due to our ability to do that.\n\nLee: That's how I originally heard of it at Kaiser Permanente. We had some users try the free version. Then they started contacting me and said, ‘Hey, have you seen that? We need to get this here within our organization.’\n\nOne of the things that attracted Kaiser to Naba was their responsiveness, their innovation, their ability to really partner. I love the word partner rather than the word vendor because they really did come in and listen to our needs, adapt to our needs, and then build and customize. Every physician writes notes in the way they want to write it. It's a very personal thing, actually. And so the different type of customization options that are built in weren't initially built in with Nabla, but through the partnership they were built in, and I think that's a similar experience that Dr. Keefer may have had at CHLA as well.",

These partnerships, worth more than $550 total, are set to bolster Nabla Bio's efforts in developing protein drugs.\n\nNabla Bio co-founders Surge Biswas and Frances Anastassacos at their labs in Cambridge, Mass\n\nBased in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Nabla Bio leverages a combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and wet-lab technologies to facilitate the design of protein drugs. Their platform focuses on high-precision, high-throughput capabilities, initially targeting antibodies against multipass membrane proteins such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and transporters. These targets are notoriously challenging due to their membrane integration, limited extracellular accessibility, and complex dynamics.\n\nTraditional drug discovery methods have mostly centered on soluble, extracellular targets, making the ability to drug multipass membrane proteins a significant advancement. Nabla Bio's technology aims to unlock these difficult targets by creating antibodies that are highly selective for specific conformations and proteins. This could potentially double the number of viable drug targets, opening new therapeutic avenues.\n\nNabla Bio's approach extends beyond membrane proteins to include the design of novel cytokines, multi-domain antibodies, and receptor traps. These advancements demonstrate the platform's broad applicability and potential to enhance in vitro activity and developability compared to existing therapies. The successes here underscore the transformative impact of generative protein design on clinical applications.\n\nThe firm was founded in December 2021, building on foundational work in protein language models by co-founder Surge Biswas and his colleagues at Harvard. Co-founder Frances Anastassacos brings experience from biotech venture capital and a PhD from Harvard, reinforcing the company's strong scientific and commercial foundation. Since its inception, Nabla Bio has raised a total of $37 million and continues to expand its team, focusing on top talents in machine learning and synthetic biology.",
      "# [Researchers say an AI-powered transcription tool used in hospitals invents things no one ever said by GARANCE BURKE, HILKE SCHELLMANN, apnews.com, garance-burke on 2024-10-26](https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-health-business-90020cdf5fa16c79ca2e5b6c4c9bbb14)\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Tech behemoth OpenAI has touted its artificial intelligence-powered transcription tool Whisper as having near “human level robustness and accuracy.”\n\nBut Whisper has a major flaw: It is prone to making up chunks of text or even entire sentences, according to interviews with more than a dozen software engineers, developers and academic researchers. Those experts said some of the invented text — known in the industry as hallucinations — can include racial commentary, violent rhetoric and even imagined medical treatments.\n\nExperts said that such fabrications are problematic because Whisper is being used in a slew of industries worldwide to translate and transcribe interviews, generate text in popular consumer technologies and create subtitles for videos.\n\nMore concerning, they said, is a rush by medical centers to utilize Whisper-based tools to transcribe patients’ consultations with doctors, despite OpenAI’ s warnings that the tool should not be used in “high-risk domains.”\n\nThe full extent of the problem is difficult to discern, but researchers and engineers said they frequently have come across Whisper’s hallucinations in their work. A University of Michigan researcher conducting a study of public meetings, for example, said he found hallucinations in eight out of every 10 audio transcriptions he inspected, before he started trying to improve the model.\n\nA machine learning engineer said he initially discovered hallucinations in about half of the over 100 hours of Whisper transcriptions he analyzed. A third developer said he found hallucinations in nearly every one of the 26,000 transcripts he created with Whisper.\n\nThe problems persist even in well-recorded, short audio samples. A recent study by computer scientists uncovered 187 hallucinations in more than 13,000 clear audio snippets they examined.\n\nThat trend would lead to tens of thousands of faulty transcriptions over millions of recordings, researchers said.\n\n___\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center’s AI Accountability Network, which also partially supported the academic Whisper study. AP also receives financial assistance from the Omidyar Network to support coverage of artificial intelligence and its impact on society.\n\n___\n\nSuch mistakes could have “really grave consequences,” particularly in hospital settings, said Alondra Nelson, who led the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy for the Biden administration until last year.\n\n“Nobody wants a misdiagnosis,” said Nelson, a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. “There should be a higher bar.”\n\nWhisper also is used to create closed captioning for the Deaf and hard of hearing — a population at particular risk for faulty transcriptions. That’s because the Deaf and hard of hearing have no way of identifying fabrications “hidden amongst all this other text,” said Christian Vogler, who is deaf and directs Gallaudet University’s Technology Access Program.\n\nOpenAI urged to address problem\n\nThe prevalence of such hallucinations has led experts, advocates and former OpenAI employees to call for the federal government to consider AI regulations. At minimum, they said, OpenAI needs to address the flaw.\n\n“This seems solvable if the company is willing to prioritize it,” said William Saunders, a San Francisco-based research engineer who quit OpenAI in February over concerns with the company’s direction. “It’s problematic if you put this out there and people are overconfident about what it can do and integrate it into all these other systems.”\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the company continually studies how to reduce hallucinations and appreciated the researchers’ findings, adding that OpenAI incorporates feedback in model updates.\n\nWhile most developers assume that transcription tools misspell words or make other errors, engineers and researchers said they had never seen another AI-powered transcription tool hallucinate as much as Whisper.\n\nWhisper hallucinations\n\nThe tool is integrated into some versions of OpenAI’s flagship chatbot ChatGPT, and is a built-in offering in Oracle and Microsoft’s cloud computing platforms, which service thousands of companies worldwide. It is also used to transcribe and translate text into multiple languages.\n\nIn the last month alone, one recent version of Whisper was downloaded over 4.2 million times from open-source AI platform HuggingFace. Sanchit Gandhi, a machine-learning engineer there, said Whisper is the most popular open-source speech recognition model and is built into everything from call centers to voice assistants.\n\nProfessors Allison Koenecke of Cornell University and Mona Sloane of the University of Virginia examined thousands of short snippets they obtained from TalkBank, a research repository hosted at Carnegie Mellon University. They determined that nearly 40% of the hallucinations were harmful or concerning because the speaker could be misinterpreted or misrepresented.\n\nIn an example they uncovered, a speaker said, “He, the boy, was going to, I’m not sure exactly, take the umbrella.”\n\nBut the transcription software added: “He took a big piece of a cross, a teeny, small piece ... I’m sure he didn’t have a terror knife so he killed a number of people.”\n\nA speaker in another recording described “two other girls and one lady.” Whisper invented extra commentary on race, adding “two other girls and one lady, um, which were Black.”\n\nIn a third transcription, Whisper invented a non-existent medication called “hyperactivated antibiotics.”\n\nResearchers aren’t certain why Whisper and similar tools hallucinate, but software developers said the fabrications tend to occur amid pauses, background sounds or music playing.\n\nOpenAI recommended in its online disclosures against using Whisper in “decision-making contexts, where flaws in accuracy can lead to pronounced flaws in outcomes.”\n\nTranscribing doctor appointments\n\nThat warning hasn’t stopped hospitals or medical centers from using speech-to-text models, including Whisper, to transcribe what’s said during doctor’s visits to free up medical providers to spend less time on note-taking or report writing.\n\nOver 30,000 clinicians and 40 health systems, including the Mankato Clinic in Minnesota and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, have started using a Whisper-based tool built by Nabla, which has offices in France and the U.S.\n\nThat tool was fine-tuned on medical language to transcribe and summarize patients’ interactions, said Nabla’s chief technology officer Martin Raison.\n\nCompany officials said they are aware that Whisper can hallucinate and are addressing the problem.\n\nIt’s impossible to compare Nabla’s AI-generated transcript to the original recording because Nabla’s tool erases the original audio for “data safety reasons,” Raison said.\n\nNabla said the tool has been used to transcribe an estimated 7 million medical visits.\n\nSaunders, the former OpenAI engineer, said erasing the original audio could be worrisome if transcripts aren’t double checked or clinicians can’t access the recording to verify they are correct.\n\n“You can’t catch errors if you take away the ground truth,” he said.\n\nNabla said that no model is perfect, and that theirs currently requires medical providers to quickly edit and approve transcribed notes, but that could change.\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\nBecause patient meetings with their doctors are confidential, it is hard to know how AI-generated transcripts are affecting them.\n\nA California state lawmaker, Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, said she took one of her children to the doctor earlier this year, and refused to sign a form the health network provided that sought her permission to share the consultation audio with vendors that included Microsoft Azure, the cloud computing system run by OpenAI’s largest investor. Bauer-Kahan didn’t want such intimate medical conversations being shared with tech companies, she said.\n\n“The release was very specific that for-profit companies would have the right to have this,” said Bauer-Kahan, a Democrat who represents part of the San Francisco suburbs in the state Assembly. “I was like ‘absolutely not.’ ”\n\nJohn Muir Health spokesman Ben Drew said the health system complies with state and federal privacy laws.\n\n___\n\nSchellmann reported from New York.\n\n___\n\nAP is solely responsible for all content.
