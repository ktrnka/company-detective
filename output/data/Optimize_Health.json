      "# [Optimize Health](https://optimize.health/blogs/)\nCCM Physician Type/Specialty RPM\n\nHow ACOs Can Leverage Chronic Disease Management Software\n\nIntroductionThe holiday season is a time for celebration, indulgence, and spending quality time with loved ones. However, it often comes with disrupted routines, dietary indulgence, and increased stress, which can take a toll on physical and mental health—particularly for those managing chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension. As we step into a new year, healthcare providers have a unique opportunity to help patients regain control over their health and establish habits that will benefit them year-round.Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) and Chronic Care Management (CCM) programs offer an ideal platform to support this transition, enabling healthcare providers to proactively address holiday health setbacks while promoting long-term well-being.The Health Risks of Holiday IndulgenceDietary OverindulgenceThe holidays often lead to excessive consumption of high-calorie foods, sugary desserts, and alcoholic beverages. On average, Americans gain about 1–2 pounds over the holidays (source), and many never lose it (source). For individuals with chronic conditions, such as diabetes, this overindulgence can cause spikes in blood sugar levels, weight gain, and increased cholesterol. Disrupted RoutinesBusy holiday schedules often disrupt exercise, sleep, and self-care routines. According to a survey by the American Heart Association, 79% of respondents overlook their health needs during the holiday season (source), citing stress and a lack of time as primary reasons. For patients managing chronic conditions, such disruptions can exacerbate symptoms and hinder progress. Increased Stress and Mental Health StrainStress levels tend to soar during the holidays due to financial pressures, family dynamics, and social obligations. Stress can negatively impact mental health, contributing to conditions like depression and anxiety (source), which in turn affect physical health metrics such as blood pressure, heart rate, and glucose levels. The Role of Remote Care in the New YearRemote care programs, including RPM and CCM, are invaluable tools for addressing the health challenges that follow the holidays. These programs empower healthcare providers to deliver consistent, proactive care while helping patients get back on track. 1. Real-Time Monitoring and Early InterventionsRPM devices like blood glucose monitors, weight scales, and blood pressure cuffs allow providers to track patients’ vitals in real time. This enables clinicians to identify trends or potential issues early, preventing costly complications such as hospitalizations or emergency room visits.For example, patients who overindulged during the holidays may see an uptick in blood sugar levels. RPM allows clinicians to intervene with timely adjustments to diet or medication (source). 2. Promoting Accountability and Healthy HabitsMany patients struggle to re-establish healthy routines after the holidays. Monitoring clinicians in RPM programs provide regular feedback and accountability, motivating patients to make better lifestyle choices.For instance, patients are more likely to stick to exercise routines or healthier eating habits if they know their weight or glucose levels are being monitored (source). 3. Addressing Mental Health NeedsCCM programs can integrate mental health support by monitoring for signs of depression or anxiety (source), particularly after the emotional highs and lows of the holidays. Regular check-ins with care teams can help patients manage stress and build resilience. Strategies for Supporting Patients in the New YearHealthcare providers can help patients overcome holiday setbacks and establish healthier habits by encouraging the following: Set Achievable GoalsWork with patients to set realistic, incremental health goals, such as walking 15 minutes a day or incorporating one extra serving of vegetables into meals. Leverage TechnologyEncourage the use of RPM devices and patient portals to track progress and maintain communication with care teams. Prioritize Mental Well-BeingRecommend stress-management techniques, such as mindfulness, meditation, or therapy, to address the emotional toll of the holidays (source). Promote Nutrition EducationOffer guidance on meal planning and healthier food choices to combat the lingering effects of holiday indulgence (source). For example, share simple swaps like choosing fruit for dessert or opting for water instead of sugary drinks. Encourage Regular Check-InsFor patients enrolled in RPM and CCM, regular check-ins with their care teams can reinforce accountability and provide the support needed to stay on track. The Benefits of RPM and CCM Post-HolidaysRPM and CCM programs provide an infrastructure for proactive, continuous care. These programs help patients:- Improve adherence to care plans.- Avoid costly hospitalizations and emergency visits.- Achieve better health outcomes through early intervention and lifestyle modifications.- Feel more connected and supported in their health journey. For providers, remote care programs can:- Increase practice revenue through additional reimbursements.- Optimize staffing by freeing up in-office resources for patients requiring immediate care.- Enhance patient satisfaction and retention through personalized, proactive care.Conclusion: A Fresh Start with Remote CareThe beginning of a new year offers a clean slate for patients to reset their health goals and reestablish healthy habits. With the help of RPM and CCM programs, providers can guide patients through this transition, addressing post-holiday challenges while setting the foundation for long-term well-being. At Optimize Health, we specialize in implementing RPM and CCM solutions that enhance patient outcomes and simplify practice workflows.

      "# [Remote Patient Monitoring Software on 2023-11-02](https://optimize.health/rpm-software/)\nThe connected devices record the vitals and then sync automatically with the software. The data also becomes part of the patient’s electronic health record. Those readings can initiate alerts if they are outside of the thresholds that you set for patients. The data exchange occurs continuously.\n\nThe software automatically tracks the number of patient readings and the engagement time. Adding manual time spent on evaluations and consultations is also available. With sorting filters, you can view readings and engagement minutes by patient to determine who is on track to meet monthly billing requirements. The system also tracks whether the patient has completed the synchronous call requirement to bill. You can export all data identifying eligible patients from the billing tab to your billing system.\n\nOur software and all supporting services, including insurance eligibility verification, are HIPAA compliant. Our software uses the agile methodology, so we can quickly integrate the latest CMS guidelines into the platform. This ensures you are always compliant and have a complete audit trail if needed.",
      "# [Remote Patient Monitoring Devices on 2023-11-02](https://optimize.health/connected-devices/)\nAll devices we provide are FDA-approved. The agency has many protocols to ensure they are safe to use. Additionally, manufacturers must have provisions in place for data security to mitigate the risk that’s inherent with internet-connected devices. The security guidelines also adhere to HIPAA compliance mandates.\n\nOnce devices are on your network, data encryption, cybersecurity best practices, compliance, and privacy regulations remain a priority.\n\nCellular connectivity and Bluetooth are the most common ways to connect devices online. If using a cellular network, there’s no need for a smartphone, which is a Bluetooth requirement.\n\nConnecting via Bluetooth can also be cumbersome for patients because they need to “pair” the device and their phone. Reliable and uninterrupted internet access is a requirement for Bluetooth, while cellular has broader coverage and is the easiest to set up. The device is ready right out of the box.\n\nOnce you implement our RPM software, you will work with our implementation experts to order the relevant FDA-compliant connected devices. We can deliver them directly to patient homes. After training and implementation, data begins to transmit from the devices to your RPM platform. Your program for remote care is ready, with accurate and reliable data at your fingertips.",

      "# [The Genesis of the Remote Care Platform](https://blog.optimize.health/genesisofremotecareplatform)\nWhen I joined Optimize Health almost two years ago, I was incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead of us in the market.\n\nToday, that excitement is 100-fold as we officially launch the new Optimize Health remote care platform. I teased the launch of this solution a few months ago, and here are some reviews from our pilot clients:\n\n\"This platform is actually built for a physician mindset, rather than a list of features that people think should be in a platform.”\n\n“Optimize Health is making remote care valuable to the patient.\"\n\n\"The platform focuses on the benefit for the actual patient, not just how to get 20 minutes of engagement. We're able to focus on what’s going to make the patient better and better their outcomes with the least amount of technological barriers.”\n\nSo why’d we build it? When I’d visit our customers, I heard the same thing over and over again: “We love what you’re doing, but we want more.” It’s rare to join a company as a Product leader where product-market fit already exists, and we needed to take advantage of this rarity. We made the decision to build the next-generation platform that could do more for our customers, as well as the things they didn’t know they needed. Enterprise-grade security. AI-powered patient engagement. Extensible across any remote care program.\n\nAny care, one platform.\n\nCombining product-market fit with happy customers and a huge opportunity to support the future of remote care–that’s why I'm excited.\n\nI’d be remiss not to list a few of my favorite features:\n\nGlobal search: search the entire platform by anything. Anything. Did someone drop off a device and you don’t know who it belongs to? You can search by Device ID. Looking for a patient and only know their birth month? You can search by that.\n\nManaged Services for all: Create care plans and goals for patients across RPM, CCM, PCM, or CCCM. And we’ll do the rest of the work. We’ll let you know who can be monitored when, who can be billed, and who needs more support.\n\nReal-time revenue dashboard: now you know exactly how your program is performing in the moment, not days, or even weeks later.\n\nFamily, Friends, and Caregivers: engage with your patients’ entire support network to ensure they stay committed to improving their health. We know it takes a village.\n\nBuilding a world-class product is one thing, and we are damn proud of what we announced today, but building a world-class Product and Engineering team is a whole other story. And no small feat. We have been able to do this at Optimize Health for three reasons.\n\nWe are a mission-driven organization.\n\nWe are on a mission to transform how medical groups use technology and real-time data to treat patients outside of the practice walls. To us, it’s simple: brick-and-mortar medical care isn’t going anywhere. But it’s also 2023, and doctors need help managing all of their patients, and a lot of those patients need more support than what they’re getting in-office. That’s what we’re here for, and that’s why we love building for our users. We see the fruits of this labor every day when patients thank our nurses for helping them improve their conditions. There is no better feedback loop and no better feeling than this.\n\nWe are a product-first organization, and we are driven to build beautiful and functional products that create real value for our customers.\n\nI’ve built a lot of products throughout my career, and I’ve learned that creating real value is an art. There are beautiful products out there, and there are functional products out there. But building products that are both beautiful and functional and also create value for our doctors and our patients is truly extraordinary. Being a part of an organization that is centered around this is the reason we’re able to launch the industry-leading remote care platform today.\n\nThis is an incredible opportunity to make a real difference and drive the future of the remote care industry.\n\nI wrote above that we needed to take advantage of product-market fit, a happy customer base, and a huge opportunity, and I’m not exaggerating when I say huge. The virtual care industry is a $250 billion dollar industry that is ripe for disruption and a true vision. There are a ton of digital health solutions out there, but they’re siloed and each one is trying to solve its own little problem.\n\nWe see the opportunity to consolidate the remote care space, and lead it. Our providers want to serve their patients remotely but also successfully and seamlessly, and so we built the platform that will help them do this. No other platform does it as well as we do.",
      "# [Technology Requirements for Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)](https://blog.optimize.health/software_hardware_rpm)\nAs remote patient monitoring has evolved from a nice-to-have to a must-have for practices that want to deliver continuous care and improve outcomes, so have the number of RPM solutions. So how do you determine which platform has the features that you really need? This blog dives into the most important technology requirements to consider when evaluating RPM platforms.\n\nSet-up and Security\n\nEasy patient setup – A good RPM solution should allow a patient to be easily added and set up in the platform in just a few steps. As your RPM program scales, you will want to make sure your solution makes it easy to add patients and grow your RPM program without overburdening your team.\n\nSecurity, and Compliance – Many patients lack confidence their health information remains private. Making your patients feel comfortable using their devices is critical to driving engagement. RPM companies that are committed to the highest levels of safety and security will go beyond HIPAA requirements and seek HITRUST Certification–the industry standard for security and privacy.\n\nClear Workflows and Communication Tools\n\nClinical Insights – Your RPM platform should make it simple for your clinical team to prioritize patient needs. You should be able to set custom thresholds for each reading type such as diastolic and systolic blood pressure. The platform should automatically send alerts when a patient has an out of threshold reading so you always know who needs immediate help. In addition, many solutions use visual notifications to help you analyze trends and intervene as soon as possible.\n\nPatient Engagement Tools – RPM is only successful when the monitoring team can engage with patients to build trusted relationships. This requires easy-to-use communication tools such as text messaging, click-to-call phone calls, and live video right in the RPM platform. In addition, a good solution will allow for two-way messaging, so that any time a patient responds to a text or calls you back, that you can take action right away.\n\nTime Tracking and Reimbursement Support – A strong RPM solution will automatically track patient engagement minutes, including synchronous versus asynchronous time. Look for solutions that make it easy to see which patients are on track for meeting billing requirements, such as 16 days of readings and 20-minutes of care team member time. If your care team needs flexibility for tracking time spent outside the system, such as calling from a personal cell phone, your platform should allow you to add those minutes.\n\nSeamless Patient Handoffs - You will likely have multiple clinicians monitoring patients, so it’s important that your RPM platform makes it easy to send and share patient notes, historical messaging, and care plans. This enables clinicians to seamlessly step in and provide care without missing important notes or action items.\n\nRecord Keeping – Medicare and insurance audits can happen. Your RPM platform should have the capability to track detailed utilization and easily provide the documentation that could be required to address any regulatory and compliance concerns.\n\nFlexible Technology\n\nCellular Devices – The best RPM platform only matters if patients are actually taking readings. For most practices, that means choosing simple, cellular devices. The easier a device is to use, the more often it will get used. While Bluetooth devices may offer additional features, they can be more challenging to use. Bluetooth devices require an internet connection, knowledge on how to pair and sync devices, and app updates to ensure readings are always synced to the RPM software.\n\nTechnical Support – A great solution will offer multiple technical support options to meet your needs. This could include self-service support articles or guides to help resolve minor issues, as well as the ability to talk to a real person when you need more help. Your solution should be open to product feedback and continuously improving the platform to meet your needs.\n\nConsidering Launching an RPM Program or Switching Vendors?",
      "# [How RPM Can Help Manage Obesity](https://blog.optimize.health/rpm-obesity)\nObesity is a complex chronic health condition that can lead to poorer mental health outcomes, reduced quality of life, and increased risk for diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and some types of cancer.\n\nOne-third of Americans have obesity. Costs for all of the facets of medical care for obesity total $147 billion.\n\nManagement of obesity can have a wide variety of options ranging from nutrition to physical activity to surgical interventions. 50-70 percent of adults with obesity have tried to lose weight and national guidelines recommend 10 percent weight loss, but even 5 percent has shown health benefits.\n\nRPM Makes it Easy for Patients\n\nLosing weight and maintaining weight loss is difficult. Connected RPM scales equip patients with support for adherence in checking their weights, visualizing trends with weight over time.\n\nRPM removes the friction of patient compliance with daily weigh-ins, recording these numbers, and bringing them to their provider to discuss their progress with weight loss. Furthermore, the integration of the weight trend data into the provider platform allows for the health system to engage and reach out to patients who might be deviating from their weight goals.\n\nRPM allows providers to check in with patients with the context of their weight loss and support them with a supportive educational curriculum surrounding nutrition and physical activity.\n\nClinical Studies Show Benefits of Digital Technology\n\nA study published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) concluded that “Weighing every day led to greater adoption of weight control behaviors and produced greater weight loss compared with weighing most days of the week. This further implicates daily weighing as an effective weight loss tool.”\n\nAdditionally, a randomized controlled trial measured the efficacy of a telemedicine-based weight loss program with video conference health coaching support. The study found that clinically significant weight loss was achieved in 69.2 percent in the intervention group versus 8 percent in the control group.\n\nLearn More About RPM",

      "# [Q&A with Optimize Health Co-Founder, Jeff LeBrun](https://blog.optimize.health/qa-jeff-lebrun)\nJeff LeBrun is the Co-Founder of Pillsy and Optimize Health. After serving as CEO for 6+ years, Jeff recently shifted to a new role as Executive Chairman and Chief Strategy Officer. We asked Jeff a few questions about the origins of the company, the future of RPM, and why he is so passionate about RPM in our “Meet Jeff” blog post.\n\nYou have been involved with multiple start-ups over the course of your career. What was the motivation for starting Pillsy and how did the universe lead you to your co-founder, Chuks Onwuneme?\n\nThe idea for Pillsy evolved from a couple of different startups over the course of my career. At one of these startups, I was supporting some of the early wearable device companies. Interest in these devices grew as the companies began connecting them to the internet. It was easy for me to imagine the potential applications in healthcare and the value of continuous medical data.\n\nI also started a VC-backed biotech startup in graduate school, where I quickly learned how significant of a problem medication adherence is in the US. Only 50% of prescribed medications are taken appropriately. This leads to 125,000 lives lost unnecessarily and costs the healthcare system about $300 billion annually. Those facts blew me away, so I naturally started thinking about solutions. Having followed products like Fitbit from their pre-launch, I started to think about the potential impact of that kind of technology approach.\n\nAround that same time, I developed an allergy to my new puppy and started taking an allergy pill prescription. While I think of myself as a relatively competent person, I still found it difficult to develop a new routine around taking the pill.\n\nWith this work history experience and my own personal experience, I began reading about the “Nudge” and “Hooked” concepts in the newest behavioral science books. I became very interested in applying the work I did with the early wearables to medication adherence. The initial concept was creating a Fitbit-quality experience for people taking medications. By using similar design principles and the new (at the time) Bluetooth Low Energy technology, I knew there was potential to help people develop healthier habits that ultimately saved lives.\n\nI met Chuks through the startup community in Seattle. We started hanging out together and building some things, initially just for fun. I was taking a year off to focus on learning, including UX design and coding classes, so I made it a goal to create a Bluetooth-enabled medication adherence product. After some market research revealed enough consumer demand, we decided to go for it and Pillsy was born.\n\nYou shifted the focus of the company from Medication Adherence to RPM when CMS introduced reimbursement for RPM. But now, with RTM it looks like reimbursement for Medication Adherence could be in the foreseeable future. How could that impact Pillsy?\n\nI like to joke that we were about 5-7 years ahead of the market for Pillsy. In healthcare, sometimes it takes longer to get your product covered by payers even when there is legitimate demand and clear clinical benefit. In addition to navigating the bureaucracy of big payers, there are often other interests being protected that can slow down the process.\n\nBut eventually, healthcare can change for the better. And in this case, reimbursement for technology-enabled medication adherence will be huge.\n\nThinking about it another way, with all the changes that we’ve seen over the past 20 years, will the de-facto format for delivering medications still be plastic orange bottles in another 20 years? Let’s hope not. Orange bottles weren’t actually designed for patients. They were designed 40-50 years ago to streamline work for the pill-filling machines. And while they might save 45 cents of labor per fill, they are horrible to use, which contributes to the non-adherence problem.\n\nAt a certain point, the industry has to acknowledge how bad the existing medication delivery experience and ensuing outcomes are for the majority of people. It’s just a matter of time.\n\nIn the pharmaceutical world, drugs for chronic diseases are mostly commoditized generics. That means for 98% of the drugs dispensed, there is no differentiation on the actual drug being sold. However, there is plenty of room to differentiate on experience, or to go “beyond the pill” as many pharma people like to say. With technology, it’s possible to provide a digital coach that goes beyond the initial prescriber and the pharmacist to provide continuous 24/7 support. It could save tens of thousands of lives every year.\n\nYour LinkedIn tagline says you are “Building the Future of Continuous Remote Care”. What does that mean and how does it go beyond RPM?\n\nToday’s care is mostly episodic in nature, meaning that visits happen infrequently in the clinic. That has shifted to some degree post-COVID, but I think there is a realization that we have the technology to extend care beyond the four walls of a medical practice. Demand for these types of experiences is growing and they can provide superior clinical outcomes as well as improve overall quality of life for many patients.\n\nI’ve been known to say that remote patient monitoring is to remote care as books were to Amazon’s e-commerce business. It’s a great place to start, but it’s not necessarily the end game. I think people and practitioners want a single trusted partner to handle the bulk of their remote care interactions. It’s our goal to be that partner.\n\nOptimize Health recently hired a new CEO. What does Todd bring to the future of Optimize Health?\n\nHaving spent 10 years at athenahealth, Todd has amazing experience leading large teams and scaling digital health companies in our space. I’ve been successful as an innovator and an executor, but doing it at that scale like Todd is not something I’ve done. It’s a great combination.\n\nThe RPM field was really new when you started Optimize Health and it’s become an increasingly crowded field. How does Optimize Health stand out and how do you plan to stay ahead of the competition?\n\nThere’s a saying that if you don’t have any competition you should be worried. When we started out, I found that a big part of our initial job was educating people on the market itself. We used to have to prove that reimbursement was real by showing an Explanation of Benefits to practices. At this point, RPM is no longer a secret, especially with COVID dramatically accelerating the adoption of telehealth. More people are looking to provide these services and get reimbursed for them.\n\nWe are staying ahead by consistently improving and innovating. And, of course, we need to measure those improvements. In addition, we’ve developed a reputation for delivering on what we say we’ll deliver on. In this business, execution is the name of the game, and something that sounds too good to be true usually is.\n\nWe focus on executing and delivering value to our customers and patients. At the end of the day, we know our true mission is about improving patient care. That’s more important than beating our competitors, but putting patients and providers first will ultimately allow us to continue to outperform the other players.\n\nPersonally, I pick one thing that I want to improve on every day, week, and month. I write it down and I dedicate time to doing that, whether it’s through reading, coaching, or whatever. That goes for the individual Optimizers too; we encourage everybody to define and work on their own personal development goals.\n\nThe University of Michigan (Go Blue!) is well known for producing great entrepreneurs. Tell us a little more about your startup mentorship with TechArb at Michigan and why it’s important to you.\n\nGo Blue!\n\nPrior to attending Michigan, I had started websites around travel and live music venues that got some traction. But, I didn’t really know what to do when I started getting calls from other startups and VCs who wanted to partner with me. Michigan is where I learned how to think about a business more systematically, and how to do some specific things like read a term sheet and make a cap table.\n\nWe’ve collaborated with Michigan students in several ways, from hosting interns through the Zell Lurie program (especially helpful in a rapid phase of growth after COVID), to sponsoring projects through the School of Public Health and the Ross Business School. The Social Venture Fund, which was started by a couple of my friends when I was in school, has also invested in TechArb, as did a fellow entrepreneur from the Wolverine Venture Fund.\n\nThis is important to me because I saw the advantages that other students had coming out of schools in the Bay Area or Boston, where there is more local access to entrepreneurship and to VCs. Michigan has a large community of alumni entrepreneurs, but there is no single physical nexus where we all reside.\n\nEntrepreneurship has become a significant part of my self identity, so it’s important to me to give back. Through mentoring and coaching, I try to help the super talented Michigan students and alumni who want to build new things and have a positive impact on the world. And, it’s always been a lot of fun and incredibly rewarding to watch their ideas come to life."

The reason I make this distinction is that competition is usually not the way to optimize health, and I've heard that marathon-running is at a point where it's not maximally healthy.  If that's what most people are into here, that's fine and dandy, but that's not what I'm personally looking for.\n\nSo if my only goal is to be maximally healthy, how exactly should I be incorporating running?  How many times a week?  Is 3-4 consecutive days good (the other days I lift and want to conserve energy)?\n\nMale / Age 21\n\n## Comment ID em2p8mk with +20 score by [(malface7931, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em2p8mk/) (in reply to ID birz8u):\nFrom what I understand of cardio health, running approx. 5km at a decent pace at least 4 days a week would give you quite a good level of cardio health without stressing your body.

My routine is similar to what you mention, but I throw in a long run of at least 10 km once a week. This helps as a base for race season for me, so that I'll have a stronger base to start off training with. Races are great motivation, but I never aim to compete against anyone but myself--namely, my past self. (These last bits are anecdotal, of course.)\n\nHowever OP, I would not run 4 consecutive days. You need some rest days (or cross-training, too) in between runs. They say these rest days are when your body really works to build your strength. For example, I might run Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday.\n\n## Comment ID em31y9d with +23 score by [(tdammers, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em31y9d/) (in reply to ID birz8u):\nScience doesn't have a definitive answer for you here, but we do know a few things.\n\nFirst; \"more is more\", but not linearly so - that is, running twice as much does not produce twice the health benefits, rather maybe like 110-120% or so (I'm making this figure up, for illustrative purposes - main takeaway is that it's sublinear). Whether there is a maximum volume after which health benefits go down again is still a controversial question; some studies seem to support this hypothesis, but flaws have been pointed out in all of them so far.\n\nThen, a very important variable is training. 30 miles per week is \"maintenance\" for me, while for a brand new runner it'd be way above their abilities, and for an elite marathoner it would essentially be a week off. It's all relative, training above your level isn't sustainable, but as you adapt to training, your limit will shift, and what is a reasonable volume depends on that.\n\nGiven all this, there is no clear answer, because it depends on so many things. What can your body handle naturally? What's your running fitness like? What kind of injury / overtraining risk are you willing to accept? How hard are your workouts?\n\nThere is not anything fundamentally unhealthy about running marathons; problems arise when people *race* them, pushing their limits - as with any sport, doing that comes at a risk, and while the risks of running long distance may be different than those seen in other sports, the reason people get hurt has little to do with the distance per se. If you are trained for it and go at a pace that is well within your comfort zone, then even ultramarathon distances aren't really all that hardcore. I've done 10k races that were definitely harder on my body than some 30-40 mile runs I've done at a comfortable (as far as such a thing as \"comfort\" exists past mile 20) pace. Humans have run much longer distances than that throughout history; even the legenday Pheidippides, who inspired the Marathon as a discipline, didn't just run from Marathon to Athens (~25 miles) - he ran from Marathon to Sparta (some 120 miles) in one day, then back the next day, then participated in the battle, and THEN he'd run to Athens, where he collapsed from exhaustion (but probably survived - the dying part may be just poetic hyperbole). So not \"25 miles and then death\", but \"almost 300 miles and a battle, and he still made it\". And he was just doing his job; Greek armies employed professional runners who would routinely run upwards of 100 miles in a day as part of their jobs.\n\nSoooo... what do?\n\nBasically, if you want to run for health, and have your strength covered with lifting, then I'd recommend starting with some beginner program (couch to 5k, a.k.a. c25k, is good), and from there, gently work your way up to where you can comfortably run for an hour or so, at a leisurely pace, a couple times per week (putting you in the 3-5 hours per week range). It seems that this is approximately where the cost / benefit ration of maintaining the required training volume starts shelving off - you still get upwards of 90% of the health benefits, and if trained properly, a very very small risk of serious damage or injury. \"Every other day\" seems like a decent balance to me - for a beginner, more days may be too taxing, and later it may not be worth pushing for more, especially if you also do other exercise.\n\n\"Conserving energy\" is not a concern btw; lifting doesn't burn that much, and taps into different energy sources (slow running is mainly fat and some glycogen, but you need to keep going for about 3 hours or so to make a serious dent in your glyco stores), while lifting mainly runs on ATP, and gets refilled from available carbs (but you can never possibly lift enough to deplete the glyco stores). So if you \"run out of energy\", what really happens is that your muscles aren't recovered yet. But if you run at a truly slow pace, and lift heavy (hi-res, lo-rep), then you will almost exclusively recruit slow-twitch fibres for running, and fast-twitch for lifting. OTOH, if you run too fast, running will use fast-twitch too, and the result is slow progress on the running front, and jelly legs when lifting after running.\n\n### Comment ID em34zlw with +4 score by [(OracleOfOntario, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em34zlw/) (in reply to ID em31y9d):\nwow, great post, that's some sage advice.\n\n## Comment ID em2okkw with +10 score by [(ithinkitsbeertime, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em2okkw/) (in reply to ID birz8u):\nThe CDC says:\n\n>For substantial health benefts, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) to 300 minutes (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes) to 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity.  \n>  \n>Preferably, aerobic activity should be spread throughout the week. Additional health benefts are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond the equivalent of 300 minutes (5 hours) of moderate-intensity physical activity a week.\n\nThey define 'moderate' and 'vigorous' in terms of METs but jogging / running probably meets the thresholds for vigorous unless you're walking big parts of it. So 3-4 days of 30-45 minutes would certainly get you there. Lifting of course also counts. I don't think I'd schedule my days consecutively though, I'd probably alternate running and lifting.\n\n### Comment ID em2ouwt with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em2ouwt/) (in reply to ID em2okkw):\nAlright, this sounds good.\n\n### Comment ID em7vtue with +1 score by [(myprivatethroway, Reddit, 2019-05-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em7vtue/) (in reply to ID em2okkw):\nWhat does *at least \"range\"*  mean?\n\n  \n\n\nAt least 150 minutes of work is a lot less than at least 300 minutes of work\n\n## Comment ID em2q2ba with +11 score by [(OracleOfOntario, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em2q2ba/) (in reply to ID birz8u):\nI too run for health, but the competition aspect makes it way more fun if you plan on running over many years.

The border between Z1 and Z2 representing the first lactate turnpoint \\~ 2mmol. The border between Z2 and Z3 representing the second turnpoint \\~ 4mmol.In this model, Zone 2 would be similar to a Zone 3 (on a Five Zone scale) - correlating with somewhere around 80-85% of Max HR.\n\nIn any case, I don't know if I have misinterpreted the question, but it seems many replies have read the question differently than I.\n\nThe subject is asking if \"cardio is necessary\", but the main body implies if high intensity cardio is necessary, or if his long walks are adequate.\n\nI'm still new to this subject as a whole but I've immersed myself in it over the past six months, digesting hours of content from Peter Attia, Mike Joyner, Andy Gaupin, Huberman, Stephen Seiler, etc. Stephen in particular has a lot of specialised content on youtube focusing on this, and \"how low is too low\" intensity wise.\n\nI'd direct you to this chart ([https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/coggan-s-physiological-adaptation-chart/75468](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/coggan-s-physiological-adaptation-chart/75468)) which shows the different adaptations (or lack thereof) that happen during cardio at different intensity.\n\nReally, if your goal is to improve VO2 max -- long walks are not adequate. That doesn't mean you wont enjoy those walks and still burn calories - but it won't do wonders for VO2max. That chart will loosely illustrate the amount of Vo2 max improvements you'll get from each intensity level - as well as a plethora of other adaptations that occur. It's quite informative. (I focus on Vo2 max purely as that's typically touted as one of the best predictors of longevity as a whole, but there are tons of other benefits from high intensity cardio).\n\nA simple cardio workout routine (which has worked for me, improving my 5K time from over 30 minutes to less than 19 minutes across a four month time span) has been:\n\n3 x \"Zone 2\" runs (based on the 5-HR Zones) for 45-75 minutes per run (dependent on how much time I have - more the better)  \nand  \n1 x \"Vo2 max protocol\" - my preference is 1km repeats (running at 95% effort for 1km) with a 1:1 rest recovery ratio. Repeat this 5-6 times, with 1.5km warm up.  \n\n\nIf I get time for another run, I'll typically throw in a Tempo or Threshold Run (eg. running for 5-10K at 90% of max HR).\n\nThat improved my Vo2 max from 35 (estimate) to 55 (estimate) across those same four months. (Estimate based on the average of both Apple Watch and the vo2 max estimate that the Cooper Test (12 minute run) formula spits out).\n\n## Comment ID k92m2md with +9 score by [(eat_natural, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k92m2md/) (in reply to ID 17ub1wx):\nIt’s my understanding that cardiorespiratory fitness has distinct health benefits over weight resistance training. While there are overlapping benefits between the two, cardiorespiratory exercises have a stronger beneficial impact on vascular health by improving the amount of nitric oxide present, blood vessel responsiveness to nitric oxide, and thus, a lower resting blood pressure. Beyond that, there is evidence to suggest that endothelial integrity is improved with a lower likelihood of lipoprotein penetration into the endothelium. Separately, there is also evidence that running stabilizes pre-existing atherosclerotic plaque and also reduces plaque volume / size. Angiogenesis is another benefit, where additional blood vessel growth occurs, while also dilating and enlarging existing blood vessels. There is evidence that endurance training reduces risk of sudden cardiac death from arrhythmia. Endurance training has a more significant impact on cardiac function, such as stroke volume, as well as VO2 max. It is my understanding that VO2 max is the strongest predictor of longevity, more so than insulin resistance, hypertension, obesity, etc.  Both weight resistance training and endurance training improve glucose and lipid metabolism. \n\n[Exercise benefits in cardiovascular diseases: from mechanisms to clinical implementation. Pedro L. Valenzuela.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37005351/)\n\nTo answer your question specifically, if you’re lifting hard enough at a high degree of effort and intensity, you will probably derive some of the above benefits. I do believe you would obtain additional benefit by incorporating some endurance training. Hopping on the stairclimber at the gym may be a practical way to build lower strength while incorporating endurance training.\n\n### Comment ID k95ka8m with +1 score by [(toothmanhelpting, Reddit, 2023-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k95ka8m/) (in reply to ID k92m2md):\nTo sum it up….

Overall this is worth thinking on, though Milo is talking about 6 days/week of lifting plus a lot of steps, not OPs 3 days.\n\nMy critiques of the Wolf approach are (i) a sufficiently powered subgroup analysis is probably needed to even consider a concentrated approach like that (ii) Wolf doesn't seem to appreciate a basic point about risk management-- i.e. a more diversified approach tends to pay off quite well for long term investments in a very uncertain environment (iii) Attia emphasizes performance metrics  like VO2 max which Wolf criticizes as having a major genetic component  so he wants to look at hours of effort instead... but completely ignoring performance is a bit ironic as Wolf is a strength coach so surely he appreciates the fact that *well designed and executed* lifting programs are not remotely comparable in results to that of the typical gym goer even when hours are equated... and the idea that training quality doesn't impact healthspan strikes me a as quite leap.\n\n### Comment ID k941wwe with +4 score by [(AndeyR, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k941wwe/) (in reply to ID k93hcyy):\nI feel like Peter gamifies VO2max too much, its a proxy, and chances are, training specifically for this number would not do much (or would not be as effective as someone doing sports and getting to this number as a byproduct)\n\nNext step would be to train grip strength )\n\n#### Comment ID k946hc4 with +2 score by [(NotSaucerman, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k946hc4/) (in reply to ID k941wwe):\nYea, I anticipate Peter to deprecate VO2 max over time in favor of a basket of cardio  indicators once more data becomes available.

Doing things that improve your heart health is probably a good way to improve health span.\n\nI think the reason people don't like cardio is because they buy into the \"no pain, no gain\" mentality.\n\nFor example, embracing long duration zone 2 isn't really that \"intensive\". I think it can actually be boring...so I tend to do it on an indoor bike while playing video games.\n\nI don't do the high intensity intervals as described by Attia. Instead, I've been doing clean and jerks with double kettlebells 3 days a week (modified version of Geoff Neupert's Long Cycle of Death program). About 100 reps spread over 30 minutes in various rep schemes. Lots of time in Zone 5, but with work periods on the order of 15-30 seconds (depending on rep scheme) and similar rest periods. But each workout has 30-40 sets depending on the rep scheme.\n\nSo not the prescription Peter gives, but my guess is that it's fine provided I'm not trying to be an elite cyclist. And it's way easier on my knees than sprinting. Seems to me like a great combination of strength and cardio. It's the only workout where I really get that \"runner's high\".

This is typically correlated with 65-80% of max HR - but everyone's will actually be different. But if you reach that range with brisk walking, then yes - Zone 2 can be achieved.\n\nHowever as you get fitter, you will notice you can now maintain the same pace as before, but at a much lower heart rate - meaning you will have to increase the intensity to stay in that zone. Whether this is simply ramping up the incline %, or if you need to up the pace to a slow jog.\n\nMost people will sustain Zone 2 with a slow jog - you definitely do not have to \"run\" to stay in Zone 2 (subjective - if you're fit enough to run fast relative to others in Zone 2, you probably still don't perceive that run as a fast run, since you'd be capable of running even faster I guess!).\n\nFor me, when I first started cardio six months ago. Here's some stats for comparison:\n\nApril 19th, 2023. \"Zone 2 run\" (My Max HR is 199. Zone 2 for me is estimated at 128-160)4KM was at Zone 2 (about 30 mins) and the last 1KM was at a faster pace.\n\n1KM, 6:34, 154 HR1KM, 7:07, 160 HR1KM, 7:30, 154 HR1KM, 6:35, 154 HR1KM, 5:39, 167 HR\n\nSo that average pace of around 6:30 minutes per KM, kept me in Zone 2.\n\nHowever fast forward six months, I now need to run at around 5:00-5:15 per KM to stay in the same HR zone. Back when I started, 1 KM at 5:00 was the same time as my max 1km effort! Now I can sustain this for 15+km IN \"zone 2\" heart rate range...\n\nTL;DR - You could sustain a Zone 2 workout with brisk walks, but as your fitness improves, walking pace may no longer be sufficient.\n\nStephen Seiler has an interesting youtube video on low intensity, and \"How low is too low\" eg. Zone 1 vs Zone 2. Would recommend a lot of his content too!\n\n## Comment ID l92ehfi with +1 score by [(gettotea, Reddit, 2024-06-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/l92ehfi/) (in reply to ID 17ub1wx):\nBookmark\n\n## Comment ID lvvsfev with +1 score by [(ThatFaithlessness545, Reddit, 2024-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/lvvsfev/) (in reply to ID 17ub1wx):\n100% without a doubt, look at the most healthy fittest aged population amd what they do.\n they are soo fit and healthy still at their age because they do regular cardio not just weights.\n\n\nYou look at people who only lifted weights for most of their lives and they are either very imobile from not moving their body, they have heart issues and are overweight because all the muscle has gone and they put on alot of fat or they're dead if they were taking drugs or just eating too much all the time trying to bulk up, \n\n\nThat puts alot of pressure on your heart amd other organs while cardio gets your blood circulating, joints lubricated, keeps your brain sharp, flushes your system, improves digestion, burns alot of calories, etc. All of which weight lifting only does a fraction of if any\n\n\nDo both in balance,\n\n\nMuscle growth is cool and all but not at the expense of your overall health and well-being especially into later years\n\n## Comment ID k92v3mv with +1 score by [(medhat20005, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k92v3mv/) (in reply to ID 17ub1wx):\nIf the goal is to \"optimize health and longevity,\" I would guess (really, it's all somewhat educated guessing anyways) that more, but not too much more, than long slow walks would derive most of the benefits of a more structured zone 2 workout several times a week.

Forget the numbers, degrees and minutes, smart watches, **optimization**. Do whatever you like, and feel like doing. Don't stay in the sauna past discomfort just because someone online said they do X minutes at Y temperature, you have no business trying to reach that. Stay in the sauna as long as you're comfortable, cool down however you like and do multiple sessions in the sauna if you're up for that, and finish with a good shower.  \n\nIf you just relax and don't stress the details, going to sauna may help with those positive mental health outcomes.  \n\nAs for other health benefits, they are mainly things seen over decades of use.

The sauna itself does not work miracles, even if the Finns say so.\n\nSauna is like meditation, going to sauna and having those \"healing\" benefits (mental) requires the right state of mind, practice and peace of mind.\n\nIf you are clinically anxious or depressed, you may not have enough peace of mind to have fully relaxing sauna experience, but still it might help little.\n\nThe shock of a sauna and cold water or snow, can take a depressed person away from that horrible feeling of anxiety for a while, but unfortunately it doesn't fix anything in long run. Sauna can help recovery from mental challenges if there are other means involved, such as therapy, exercise, diet and possibly medication.

I am wondering what the motivator coming from wearing a Whoop is, or if there is any? I'm pretty sure I got the sleep part down. Want to start training more and just not sure how the Whoop would benefit me. I am stats geek and would love to get all those metrics, but.. yea.. wondering if they are the right metrics to motivate me to get more active or if this is the wrong tool for that. \n\nWould love to hear if any of you more sedentary people see benefit in this band to up your training and get motivated to do more/better training and get more active.\n\n## Comment ID ewo240v with +2 score by [(strongfranny, Reddit, 2019-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/cp9ndv/whoop_suitable_for_people_that_dont_overtrain_but/ewo240v/) (in reply to ID cp9ndv):\nI’m not sedentary but do a lot of powerlifting with long rests and not a lot of cardio data for the whoop to collect. I’ve found that it’s not actually worth it for me personally as it gives me information I already know (like when my body is absolutely beat!). I wouldn’t recommend this is worth it for you if you say that you need motivation as it is better for telling you the data from really strenuous training (I guess this is why they focus more towards athletes than gen pop). If I went on to do CrossFit or play rugby again then I would probably look at getting it again as it would be able to tell me to chill out.

It definitely tells me how hard my workout was and how good my recovery is. Those two things will change depending on your sleep/ intensity of your workouts. I use it when I run and I absolutely love it. It charts the distance and your route on the map too. So it is an amazing tool to make progress. As you do more and more workouts your body gets used to stress and you will see all that and increase the intensity of your workouts to make progress.\n\n## Comment ID ewpp1qf with +2 score by [(fishwish78777, Reddit, 2019-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/cp9ndv/whoop_suitable_for_people_that_dont_overtrain_but/ewpp1qf/) (in reply to ID cp9ndv):\nFor me, the answer is yes, the Whoop is great for helping motivate me to move, but it motivates you different (in my mind better ways) than your average fitbit style tracker. \n\nI had a variety of fitbits before and I would always fall into the same pattern: 1) try and get 10K steps a day, 2) try and get 15k steps a day, 3) try and get top 5 steps a day average of all my friends, 4) try and be number 1 on the leaderboard, 5) Crash, 6) gradually ignore fitbit and go back to 5k steps a day. In other words, the fitbit incentivized walking/running, and that's it. I felt like I was wasting a workout if I did anything else, so all I did was run or go for super long walks. \n\nOn the other hand, without a tracker (as I have been the last few months), I fell into another bad pattern: all my workouts were easy. As a solo person working out, I was too lazy to push my heart rate. I would either lift heavy weight or go on easy breezy jogs. I did get strong, but but developed zero endurance. \n\nThis is where the whoop comes in: Every morning the whoop will tell me if I'm ready for a huge cardiovascular strain. As others have said, powerlifting, walks, etc will barely register, if at all, as straining. This pushed me to try different hard workouts to push my heart. Through some experimenting, I have found the best way to push my heart rate as much as possible. When I do this, invariably when I wake up the next day my body is not ready for high strain. These are the days I lift weights or go on easy walks. So for me, the whoops forces me to better balance my workouts. It doesn't penalize you for not pushing hard on high strain days, but you do feel a sense of leaving something on the table. Nor does it penalize you for switching up workouts, it doesn't care as long as your hr is up. I switch between running, rowing, jump rope, heavy bag boxing, kettlebell swing and box jumps. \n\nSo for me personally, if my sole goal is to get my hr up and keep it up as long as possible, I know I can do a workout that incorporates rounds of double unders for 10-20 minutes, and then jump on the rower for another 40 and I'm spent. I can'd do this every day or else my feet hurt, so I switch to something like kettlebell swings. In this way I'm more balanced, don't burn out as easily. \n\nTl;dr: whoop does motivate by pushing me to train hard some days but not all days, gives me motivation to balance.\n\n## Comment ID ewo2rkk with +1 score by [(tessa0k, Reddit, 2019-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/cp9ndv/whoop_suitable_for_people_that_dont_overtrain_but/ewo2rkk/) (in reply to ID cp9ndv):\nThank you for your response.

You will have proven, by getting the BS, that you can learn to be an engineer.  You will be brought into a workplace and you’ll have to learn the job, no matter your BSE.

If you're in an ABET accredited program the things you are learning will 100% apply in the real world. New grads are like investments. Just show them that you are worth investing in, work hard and really prove to yourself that you are worth investing in and you will get a job. I never had an internship and as a CS major and I still had a job right after graduation.

I only got a chance to do an internship for one summer at a random boat manufacturer in UG.  Thought I wanted a PhD, but changed my mind and left with a masters in BMEN. Couldn’t get a job for like 8 months after graduating and started looking for shit technical work jobs without luck there either. Then out the blue I got two offers (same day) for both a development engineer contracting position and a QE contracting position making 6 figures at a global med device producer, (contracting is great sometimes). I took QE role and learned a lot of the basics on the fly while having good work ethic with the high desire to learn. Eventually moved back closer to home (snow sucks) to a smaller contract manufacturing company with some development assistance and 10x the responsibilities. Now I’m in a super stable position with good pay and I wear a lot of hats. This has given me the skills and experience to compete with some others in my field who have 6x the experience time and I get to aid in the design and development of some cool med devices. \n\nSummary: don’t give up! Realize a lot of companies don’t expect anything out of a new grad so as long as you have an engineer type mindset. Push the to gain as much experience early as you can. Contract jobs can be your golden ticket and they usually pay excellently.

Finding a BME job can be hard. Internships are crucial, but they're hard to get considering many don't want our major as much as mech, elec, or cs. \n\nI came to realize that BME is really what you make of it. Specialize in a subfield: biomechanics, imaging (most profitable imo), cellular mechanics, bioinstrumentation, biomaterials, etc. See if you can find work in those fields and see if you can somehow focus your coursework for a subfield. Then do internships. You'll find that it's easier that way. Startups are easier to get into than companies like J&J or Stryker, so start low and then build your way up to them. \n\nOr you can go into a field in which BME is actually more desired: health informatics and data science. It's a field that any major can go into, but your BME background can really set you apart in compared to other engineers. Besides, it often pays higher than entry level engineering jobs. Make sure you know how to code in one or two languages and understand how you can use data science techniques to solve health related problems or optimize health industry systems.\n\n### Comment ID ege4cy1 with +2 score by [(doggoistlife, Reddit, 2019-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/aq6p4t/im_a_lost_biomedical_engineering_undergrad/ege4cy1/) (in reply to ID ege479m):\nOh cool, now this is some specific info from a fellow undergrad i was looking for\n\n#### Comment ID ege4gp2 with +2 score by [(itanorchi, Reddit, 2019-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/aq6p4t/im_a_lost_biomedical_engineering_undergrad/ege4gp2/) (in reply to ID ege4cy1):\nI'm doing BME in grad now too and boy let me tell you how much easier it's been trying to get data science internships than engineering ones.\n\n## Comment ID egeadxr with +1 score by [(hipstergrandpa, Reddit, 2019-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/aq6p4t/im_a_lost_biomedical_engineering_undergrad/egeadxr/) (in reply to ID aq6p4t):\nAs someone else who's been there, internships are a 100% must!

Perhaps many of them do just a quiz and that might be why you're essentially asking \"Is the juice worth the squeeze?\". Does the insane measuring make a difference?\n\nYou go to where to puck will be, not where it currently is. I think many imagine Bryan Johnson creating this and he's probably already planning it. He has a targeted audience so it fits like a glove. He recently started certifying red light therapies if I remember correctly. I think he will be your biggest competitor when it would comes to making similar measurements as him and setting up a personal Blueprint. Can you imagine what's stopping him from doing it? \n\nIn reality, hospitals should already do this but I can only imagine the costs in USA. And here in Sweden where healthcare is almost free, it doesn't fit the government budget. But in reality, this kind of preventative healthcare is definitely worth A LOT. I think despite the competition it's untapped, because not enough people are interested in it already so demand will grow. \n\nBut how will you finance the startup phase? Are you going to make the supplements yourself so you can fine tune the amounts? What labs will you be collaborating with (I think that should be easy). And you probably don't have any experience with recommending supplements based on measurements so you'd have to outsource that too (I don't know this I'm just guessing that's how it would work). \n\nIt's interesting and I think you're right in giving it a go.

At the moment I can think of 2 ways of doing it: 1. Reconnecting relatively healthy brain to a robotic body, once its body below its chin fails for a whatever reason. Human body replaces billions of cells every day but it is still considered the same person.  At this case, consciousness is located in the brain and it is important to have it preserved and not affected by lack of oxygen or other illnesses, like Alzheimer’s etc. Once meat suit stops being efficient in its cell turnover, I want to transfer that brain to a robotic body with preserved memories and stuff. Therefore, the robotic body serves as a full scale body prosthetic. This option seems to me none durable though in a long term, as it constricted by physical brain aging. 2. Option is an alternative that based on the assumption that consciousness can be stored not only in an organic medium, like brain, but in a medium like computer. In that case again robotic body would be similar to Ultron from MCU but instead Stark’s /Banners AI it would be filled with your consciousness.\n\n## Comment ID h7z95nk with +2 score by [(Broseph-B, Reddit, 2021-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/oyys9a/whats_your_engineering_dream/h7z95nk/) (in reply to ID oyys9a):\nTo be the next iron man.

I hope we can find a cheap & quick way to build these people some permanent homes.

Endurance only counts from HP gain, if for some reason you are defending with dwellers not at lvl 50, then endurance outfits would be best \n\n\nFor questing, it's a matter of opinion, but I argue that the Expert Jumpsuit is best. Agility boosts basic attack speed. Perception makes the critical hit cross hair move slower, but that's just a matter of practice.

The collaboration combines PatchRx's patented medication adherence technology and Optimize Health's remote patient monitoring platform to give providers unparalleled insight into a patient's history, medication-taking behaviors, and response to treatment — ultimately minimizing adverse outcomes and reducing unnecessary costs.\n\nMedication non-adherence costs the U.S. healthcare system over $100 billion annually due to avoidable hospitalizations, increased service utilization, unnecessary pharmacy costs, and diagnostic testing. For patients with chronic and complex conditions, the risk of non-adherence is especially profound, accounting for up to 25% of medication-related hospitalizations, and 125,000 deaths every year in the U.S. Despite this pervasive challenge, most healthcare providers today lack the tools to effectively compare a provider's recommended medication therapy with the patient's actual medicine-taking behavior. This partnership gives providers an unparalleled view into previously inaccessible health data for some of their most vulnerable patient populations, empowering better treatment outcomes and reducing unnecessary costs.\n\n\"Utilization of telehealth and remote-first care took off in 2020 and has stabilized at levels 38X higher than pre-pandemic. As patients increasingly embrace remote care, healthcare providers are looking for ways to seamlessly monitor treatment outside of the traditional clinical setting,\" said Andrew Aertker, co-founder and CEO of PatchRx. \"Our partnership with Optimize Health brings together often fragmented point solutions to deliver a truly comprehensive model of remote monitoring, setting the standard for a healthier, more cost-effective future.\"\n\nPatchRx was founded in 2018 to address one of the most pressing challenges in healthcare today: medication adherence. The company's patented, smart pill-bottle technology has gained widespread adoption, improving care outcomes for thousands of patients across the U.S. The unique cap fits on the underside of any size pill bottle, gathering information securely for the patient and the patient's care team. As the adoption of Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM), Remote Therapeutic Monitoring (RTM), and Chronic Care Management (CCM) technologies continues to grow, PatchRx is well-positioned for continued momentum in 2024.\n\n\"Remote monitoring serves as a lifeline for patients who need consistent oversight,\" said Ryan Clark, CEO of OptimizeHealth. \"We know that healthcare doesn't stop at the clinic door, and by providing continuous monitoring solutions, we offer patients peace of mind and providers the tools they need to act quickly to help patients effectively manage potentially debilitating chronic conditions.\"\n\nTo learn more about PatchRx and its patented medication adherence technology, visit PatchRx.io.\n\nAbout PatchRx\n\nPatchRx is revolutionizing patient care through its clinically-backed medication adherence technology.

      "# [Sait Tunc receives NSF CAREER award to optimize health care systems for equitable outcomes on 2024-04-05](https://news.vt.edu/articles/2024/04/tunc-career-award.html)\nIn an effort to revolutionize the health care system through operations research and systems engineering, Sait Tunc, an assistant professor in the Grado Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, has received a National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award.\n\nThe CAREER program supports early career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education and lead advances in the missions of their department or organization. This five-year grant totaling $568,619 will support Tunc’s research on inefficiencies in health care systems, particularly with respect to organ transplants. And it couldn’t be more timely.\n\nTunc’s research regarding organ utilization comes at a pivotal time in the industry. While organ scarcity exists, there is also a significant level of underutilization. Roughly 25 percent of organs recovered from deceased donors go unused for a variety of reasons. Patients may refuse organ offers because they come from a relatively higher risk donor, or they may choose to wait to see if another “better” organ becomes available. Additionally, patients with access to higher quality health care may receive special priority.\n\n“I want to identify disadvantaged patients and improve their access to organs. Federal law prevents penalizing patients for rejecting organ offers, which creates a gap between what is optimal for the individuals and how they behave. One mechanism I developed identifies disadvantaged patient groups who have reduced access to organs, thus a higher mortality rate,” Tunc said.\n\nIn addition to matching organs to recipients more efficiently, Tunc also wants to ensure equitable access for all in need. Perhaps surprisingly, this means taking into consideration voluntary incentive mechanisms, which prioritize motivating patients based on data rather than removing the option of choice. For example, instead of mandating participation, such as forcing a patient to accept an organ of relatively lower quality, voluntary incentive mechanisms give patients agency by showing them why they could reject an organ, but why they’d be better off accepting it rather than, say, remaining on dialysis.\n\n“We use data modeling to prioritize these patients for organ offers that are most beneficial to them. This improves the match between donors and recipients and addresses the issue of organ underutilization,” Tunc said. “The challenge in organ procurement is not just about finding more donors, but ensuring that the organs are used efficiently and equitably. I want to bridge the gap between what is best for society and how individuals behave.”\n\nIncentivizing healthy behavior\n\nVoluntary incentive mechanisms work at large-scale and individual levels, and Tunc’s research addresses both. He investigates how these strategies lead to an increase in wellness-related behaviors, such as exercise or tobacco cessation. This aspect of his proposal aims to encourage healthier behaviors considering that not everyone has the same level of delay discounting and using someone’s willingness to adopt healthier activities based on what reward they would receive if they change their habits.\n\n“My primary goal with this research is to design and implement voluntary incentive mechanisms in the health care field, for both organizations and individuals,” Tunc said. “Rather than use coercion or mandated participation, voluntary incentive mechanisms encourage participants through rewards. These tend to make implementing new strategies easier compared to traditional approaches in health care and improve outcomes at the individual, organizational, and societal levels.”\n\nUsing voluntary incentive mechanisms, Tunc’s research seeks to\n\nAlleviate the burden of organ scarcity, reduce the size of the transplant waiting list, improve the access of marginalized groups to transplants, and mitigate waitlist deaths\n\nPartner with Organ Procurement Organizations to expand organ availability and overall procurement\n\nReduce disparities in transplant access, especially for those at a significant disadvantage, including older patients and patients of color\n\nAlign individual actions with societal health goals, promote healthy behaviors, and improve long-term health outcomes especially among those most in need, such as individuals living with addiction or obesity\n\nAs part of the National Science Foundation’s support for educational outreach, the impacts of Tunc’s award will span from undergraduate engineering students to medical professionals, including a partnership with Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Virginia State University (VSU).\n\nHealth care providers can adjust their response to patients based on their willingness to adopt healthier behaviors. Tunc is hopeful this strategy will encourage people to adopt healthier habits while feeling they have choices in their decision making.\n\n“It’s crucial to design programs that actually motivate people to adopt healthier behaviors by considering all these individual differences in delay discounting, which explains why some people might not find long-term rewards as enticing. People that show addictive behavior, for example, are typically associated with higher delay discounting,” Tunc said. “This will enable researchers to find strategies that work for different groups.”\n\nThe future of health care systems\n\nTunc plans to use this research as an opportunity to educate others on how operations research and systems engineering and the use of voluntary incentive mechanisms can be beneficial for those working in the health care field, including short courses for medical students on implementing voluntary incentive mechanisms, and research education that will benefit undergraduate and graduate students at Virginia Tech and beyond.\n\n\"Our partnership with VSU is quite detailed, providing summer undergraduate research assistantship opportunities for VSU students at Virginia Tech, and offering an in-person opportunity for them to engage with groups in our department and elsewhere at the university,” Tunc said. “We hope we can engage students from multiple backgrounds and disciplines to participate, and encourage them to consider health care-related studies.”\n\nTunc’s grant-related research has informed his curriculum, including two new graduate level courses addressing health systems. Looking even further, Tunc hopes the research will impact policymakers from the top down while solving this complex global challenge.\n\n\"Beyond the direct educational interventions, the outreach activities associated with this research aim for policy change at the national level,” Tunc said. “Engaging with key stakeholders and policymakers ensures that the outcomes of this research are understood and potentially integrated into the national health care system.”",
      "# [On offense: Proactively personalizing medicine to optimize health](https://pharmacy.osu.edu/news/offense-proactively-personalizing-medicine-optimize-health)\nLaura Lile, MD, RPh, BS Pharm ’87, a dual-credentialed physician and clinical pharmacist, is nationally sought after for her proactive approach to preventative health and wellness – primarily using genomics.\n\n“I started down this path for my own family because we have extremely high cardiovascular and stroke risk,” Dr. Lile said. “I wanted to see my mom and dad be able to live a longer life, rather than losing them at 70 years old, which was common in my family history.”\n\nDr. Lile’s career has always been in the details.\n\nAfter her mom had a heart attack at a young age, Dr. Lile began looking into epigenetics to understand what she could do to improve her mom’s health. However, she wanted to go further – asking ‘what is the root cause of the disease or condition that patients are experiencing?’\n\nNow, through her practice, Lile Wellness Partners, Dr. Lile partners with patients to provide precise and comprehensive insights into their genetic makeup through IntellxxDNA™ testing. In addition, she uses bloodwork as the primary basis for following trend analysis of patients – both healthy and unhealthy. The Lile Wellness team can then tinker with medicine and supplement regimens to attain optimal health for their patients’ individual needs.\n\n“We practice offense medicine, not defense,” Dr. Lile said. “We believe in getting to the root cause of a disease state or condition. Rather than treating the condition only, we look at what may be causing it, such as lifestyle or genetic predispositions, to optimize a patient’s health.”\n\nGenomic testing allows patients to understand their genome and then dial in to very specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to see their risk factors for certain conditions and disease states. Pharmacists and physicians can then use that information to understand how to work around those SNPs. Using the gene variants, the health care team can modify risk using targeted medicine and supplements and then monitor the patient’s response through bloodwork.\n\n“We use these reports to analyze genes that are present in very low percentages in the population, less than 5% to 10%. We question why these genes still exist in someone's gene pool while the rest of the world has evolved and gotten rid of them” Dr. Lile said. “We then take a deep dive into the research to see what those genes have a higher risk of causing. In isolation, these gene variants are helpful to know, but without the IntellxxDNA™ tool and the evidence-based recommendations that it provides, it can be scary to know you carry a high-risk gene. These clinical decision tools remove that fear because now we can decipher how to override that part of your genome.”\n\nDr. Lile says that PharmDs are the perfect health care practitioners to perform the complex work of interpreting a genomic test, due to their expertise in the usage of medicine and accessibility to patients.\n\n“To use this tool effectively, you don’t need to prescribe medicine. You are guiding patients with a clinical tool to understand their genome and the why behind disease states like diabetes or depression. You can provide them with a powerful tool that can be refreshed on a routine basis, putting the pharmacist in an excellent position to be the patient’s health care advocate. Genomic tools can expand the role of the pharmacist.”\n\nHer strong belief that pharmacists can play a vital role in this process led Dr. Lile to invite four Ohio State PharmD students to an IntellxxDNA™ conference in the summer of 2023. She felt that it was her pharmacy training – not her medical training – that enabled her to understand the extremely complex reports she receives through genetic testing.\n\nOne of the students who attended the conference, Class of 2024 PharmD candidate, Kate Pollock, has continued her work with Dr. Lile and will join the Lile Wellness team upon her graduation in May 2024 as the first full-time PharmD in the clinical practice who will see patients and complete consults, rather than filling prescriptions.\n\nEven before tools like IntellxxDNA™, Dr. Lile had been using patients’ bloodwork markers to narrow in on improving health outcomes. However, the IntellxxDNA™ report, provides an immediate roadmap to optimal health outcomes without having to guess what’s going on with only some of the information.\n\n“I’ve spent years tweaking medications and supplements in patients to ensure that I see the responses in their blood work that I expect to see. While I’ve been doing this for years, I now have a clinical decision support tool that can get patients to optimal medication support on day one because we know exactly what their body needs.”\n\nDr. Lile and Pollock both attest to the benefits that their patients are seeing through this DNA-targeted precision-based medicine approach.\n\n“It has been great to meet with patients at their follow-up visits and hear how they’ve been able to participate in things like hiking or exercise that they weren’t able to before the testing,” Pollock said. “Patients are seeing progress on their health goals faster because we are able to tailor their body’s unique needs to them.”\n\nThey both also say the key to this type of intervention being used more widely is for pharmacists to continue to advocate for the profession.\n\n“The power of this tool can exponentially expand the role of pharmacists,” Dr. Lile said. “Pharmacists understand this complex medication and supplement-related data and use it to advocate for, and partner with, our patients. We need to identify the skill sets and value that we have as pharmacists to be a part of the solution. We’ve been doing it for years – pharmacists have always been the trusted healthcare professional, especially in rural communities that routinely experience a shortage of doctors. This is a natural progression for the profession of pharmacy.”",
      "# [AHRQ Strategic Plan for Health System Transformation To Optimize Health, Functional Status, and Well-Being Among Older Adults](https://www.ahrq.gov/priority-populations/publications/aging-well.html)\nThe U.S. population is rapidly aging, and the health system is ill-prepared to meet the needs of older adults. Older adults and individuals with multiple chronic conditions frequently receive fragmented and sub-optimal care, leading to poor outcomes, including avoidable adverse events, hospitalizations, and institutionalization, as well as increased costs negatively impacting the sustainability of Medicare and state Medicaid programs.\n\nBy re-engineering healthcare delivery systems so that care transformation optimizes health outcomes, functional status, and well-being, much of the morbidity and premature mortality associated with aging can be delayed or slowed, and chronic conditions can be effectively managed, allowing people to live independently and contribute to their communities longer.\n\nThis Strategic Plan details five goals and related strategies to achieve these goals for health system transformation that optimizes the health, functional status, and well-being among older adults.",
      "# [RPM Healthcare Solutions and Benefits on 2024-02-06](https://optimize.health/blog/rpm-healthcare-benefits-challenges-solutions/)\nThe new era of chronic disease healthcare combines technology, data, insights and continuous care. With this approach, those with chronic conditions can achieve healthier outcomes. The key to this is remote patient monitoring (RPM). RPM healthcare delivers care continuity and real-time vital readings. As a result, physicians can make data-driven decisions.\n\nWhile RPM healthcare is expanding, thanks to improved clinical outcomes, increased reimbursements, and more sophisticated platforms, challenges persist. Those can be overcome with the right solutions, yielding benefits for practitioners and patients.\n\nIn this guide, you’ll learn about the benefits, challenges, and solutions of RPM.\n\nWhat is RPM healthcare?\n\nRPM healthcare describes remote care programs that use connected medical devices to monitor patient vitals between office visits. You can support a variety of chronic conditions with RPM, including:\n\nPatients take daily vital readings, such as blood pressure, A1C, weight, and oxygen saturation. These numbers automatically transmit into an RPM software platform. Clinicians review these readings, looking for any critical readings or trends that need intervention.\n\nThis is the basic workflow of an RPM program. The more data you collect, the better clinical decisions you can make. It supports improved quality of life for those with one or more chronic diseases.\n\nPutting an RPM plan in place is not without its challenges. Many of these correlate with building and sustaining a program.\n\nBenefits of RPM healthcare\n\nWhat can you expect from an RPM healthcare program? The benefits for patients and care teams are significant.\n\nCollect data to inform care decisions.\n\nThe age of data in healthcare delivers keen insights into how patients deal with chronic diseases daily. You wouldn’t be able to glean this from the few annual interactions you have with them. Visibility into conditions, their progression, and treatment effectiveness are now within reach.\n\nAll patients using RPM are at risk and often end up in the emergency department (ED). These may have been avoidable with RPM. Gathering data easily through connected devices gives you a clearer picture of each individual’s health. You’ll use this to adjust care plans, often leading to better clinical outcomes.\n\nStrengthen care coordination and continuity.\n\nThe patients you monitor with RPM may have multiple conditions. Care teams can include a variety of specialists along with primary care physicians. Ensuring all parties have access to the vital readings improves care coordination and continuity. Readings sync into the EHR (electronic health record). As a result, everyone has information, which removes blind spots.\n\nIntervene at the right time.\n\nAs noted, chronic condition patients often seek care in the ED. Without the connection between patients and clinical monitoring, people are more likely to head to the ED. This strains the healthcare system and often results in subpar care, as the physicians in the ED don’t know the patient’s history.\n\nIdeally, RPM should facilitate immediate mitigation. Studies support the idea that RPM does reduce ED visits and readmissions. A review of 91 studies on RPM and its impact on acute care determined that 49% reported decreases in ED visits.\n\nAchieving intervention requires an escalation process with monitoring teams. It should be a built-in feature in RPM software. It would involve these steps:\n\nGet insights into disease progression and treatment efficacy.\n\nChronic disease patients can be in many phases of their condition. Progression of it and treatment effectiveness are more concrete when you have daily vital data. Based on these learnings, you can discern if patients are seeing better outcomes. Those could include a drop in A1C, lower blood pressure, and weight loss.\n\nOn the other hand, you will also have information if these things worsen. Each piece of data sheds light on how a patient is managing their chronic disease. It can inform what you prescribe in terms of medication or activities. Vitals offer critical context to improving patient outcomes.\n\nImprove patient engagement.\n\nRPM can be an avenue for better patient engagement. With such a program, clinical monitoring teams have regular communication with patients and increase touchpoints. You’re engaging with them daily, which increases their ownership in the care plan. Patients who have not been able to keep up with follow-ups or complicated treatment plans now have an opportunity to be more involved in their health.\n\nGrow revenue with reimbursement support.\n\nThe central benefits of RPM healthcare relate to care and clinical outcomes. There is also the revenue aspect for practices. Ensuring that billing and reimbursements are part of the RPM solution you choose enables you to manage this more easily. The technology tracks the time spent with patients, which is crucial for claims.\n\nAdditionally, with clinical monitoring services, eligibility, and onboarding provided by your RPM vendor, you can expand the program to more patients, increasing reimbursement.\n\nIn reviewing the challenges and benefits of RPM, you’ll need a robust platform and clinical monitoring services to overcome the latter and realize the former.\n\nThe top challenges of deploying an RPM program and solutions\n\nEstablishing RPM healthcare has many dimensions and requirements. Many healthcare organizations have concerns about setting up RPM and allocating the resources to monitor patients. These challenges prevent practices and physicians from taking advantage of implementing such programs that would bring significant benefits to patients with chronic conditions.\n\nDefining patient populations that are a good match for RPM\n\nThe first part of the process is identifying which patients are good candidates for RPM. This would involve looking at the criteria of your patient population. The delivery of RPM services doesn’t require a specific diagnosis. Most likely, a substantial segment of your patients would benefit from RPM healthcare.\n\nSolution: Work with a seasoned RPM company to alleviate the burden of this step and have the vendor help you onboard suitable patients.\n\nEnsuring insurance eligibility\n\nOnce you identify patients, you’ll need to make sure their insurance covers RPM. Medicare and Medicaid have specific CPT® code reimbursements. Private insurance may also reimburse for RPM. It can be a lot of paper-pushing.\n\nSolution: Pass this on to your RPM vendor. They should use HIPAA-secure tools to determine insurance eligibility.\n\nGetting patients onboarded successfully\n\nEach patient using RPM must undergo onboarding and education on using their connected device and the importance of taking daily readings.\n\nSolution: Partner with an RPM service provider who supports patient onboarding and device shipping. The process should be easy for them and you. Onboarding should be flexible with on-site, virtual, or hybrid options. Your RPM healthcare vendor should also be able to handle shipping logistics for you.\n\nStaffing clinical monitoring\n\nThis RPM healthcare challenge is the most common. RPM requires constant monitoring by licensed healthcare professionals. Small practices and large healthcare systems each struggle with resource allocation.\n\nSolution: Outsource this to your RPM partner. Our U.S.-based, licensed nurses with clinical expertise monitor patients for you. It involves 1:1 engagement between nurses and patients. Nurses communicate with those using RPM devices, reminding them to take readings. They are the first point of contact for triage if these go outside the designated norm. If deemed serious, they escalate critical readings to physicians for intervention. Clinical monitoring services allow you to expand the RPM program with nurses who function as an extension of your care team.\n\nManaging billing and revenue\n\nAnother challenge healthcare providers may face is understanding the billing cycle and managing reimbursement. Without specific features in RPM software, it becomes cumbersome to keep documentation of the monitoring services provided manually.\n\nSolution: Choose an RPM software with features for measuring, calculating, and assessing revenue data.\n\nThese obstacles may be keeping you from launching RPM. The good news is that they are easy to overcome. When all these things are solvable, you and your patients realize the benefits of RPM.\n\nOptimize Health solutions for RPM healthcare\n\nIn building an RPM healthcare program, you’ll need solutions from a trusted partner that offers technology and monitoring services.

      "# [Social Determinants of Health and RPM on 2024-01-17](https://optimize.health/blog/address-sdoh-with-rpm/)\nCare teams face more than treating and managing the actual chronic diseases of patients. Socioeconomic and environmental factors also impact access to care, patient engagement, treatment adherence, and clinical outcomes. These social determinants of health (SDOH) in some cases are barriers to equitable and connected care. However, there are ways to address them when SDOH and remote patient monitoring (RPM) are taken into consideration as part of the care plan.\n\nCan RPM make a difference in addressing SDOH? Data and the outcomes of those practices and organizations using the Optimize Health RPM solution point to a resounding yes.\n\nHow does SDOH impact the care and outcomes of chronic disease patients?\n\nAccording to a study on the relationship between determinant factors and health outcomes, only 10-20% of a person’s health is the result of clinical care. The other 80% relates to SDOH factors—economic stability, education, and food security, for example.\n\nSDOH has six categories, as defined by the Kaiser Family Foundation:\n\nEach of these can dramatically affect a chronic condition patient’s ability to receive care and adhere to treatment plans. In this ecosystem of determinants, there are many scenarios of how these attributes impact chronic disease management.\n\nFor example, someone’s lack of transportation could keep them from regular visits or getting prescriptions filled. Another is looking at socioeconomic status; those in poverty often have limited access to healthier food options, which can cause the development of chronic conditions such as diabetes.\n\nSDOH is a cause of chronic diseases and deters improved outcomes.\n\nChronic conditions are rampant in the U.S., with 6 in 10 having one and 4 in 10 having two or more. The outcomes for these individuals vary, and SDOH is a catalyst for these being more adverse. Research indicates that SDOH contributes to chronic disease disparities in the U.S. among racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. They can even be a factor in the onset of a condition. SDOH strongly links to the onset of chronic diseases and increases the risk of hypertension and diabetes.\n\nSDOH is a powerful component in chronic disease management. The reason is that managing these conditions requires engagement by the patient and adherence to medication and care plans. With factors like feeling unsafe, low literacy, or struggling to make ends meet impacting a patients’ life, it’s challenging to get them to participate in their own health.\n\nTreating the disease and SDOH\n\nPhysicians must then “treat” not only the disease but also the SDOH and its limitations. The healthcare system has adapted in an attempt to do this. The introduction of telehealth and its growth during the pandemic, along with new reimbursement models, has been a key component. A survey on the topic found that 63% of patients “strongly agreed” that telehealth addressed SDOH concerns. Virtual visits are only part of the remote care opportunities to ease the gaps caused by SDOH. Remote patient monitoring is the next step.\n\nRemote patient monitoring and social determinants of health: how RPM addresses these challenges\n\nAddressing SDOH in your patient population starts with identifying the SDOH during patient encounters. Asking questions about access, safety, and other environmental and social factors that could impact managing their chronic conditions fulfills this step.\n\nOnce established, you can use an RPM program to expand care outside traditional settings which eliminates the limitations SDOH puts on patients regarding access to care. Patients would be able to take daily readings and their vital data will be synced and monitored by a care team member remotely. RPM delivers more data and increases touchpoints, which helps bring better health outcomes.\n\nA successful RPM program requires taking SDOH into account and driving engagement. Making it seamless and simple involves:\n\nWhen SDOH is in the picture, how you structure and support RPM matters. When launched successfully, research suggests improvements in health. Our work with practices and organizations using RPM supports this. Some data points include:\n\nRPM increases health equity\n\nAlso of note in the RPM and SDOH landscape is the topic of health equity. Health equity has a huge gap, impacting those with SDOH living in rural areas the most. For example, rural Americans are more likely to die from heart disease, cancer, and stroke, according to the CDC. There are many reasons for this, with lack of access, insurance, and financial instability influencing this statistic.\n\nFor those treating these patients as an FQHC (federally qualified health center) or RHC (rural health center), you are trying your best to make sure your patients don’t add to this statistic. These organizations have a mission to improve health equity, and RPM provides a great means to do this. The 2024 CMS Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) offers optimistic news for FQHCs and RHCs to expand or launch RPM. Beginning January 1, 2024, they are able to bill using G0511, enabling billing for RPM services multiple times per calendar month.\n\nThis change offers an opportunity for FQHCs and RHCs to address SDOH with RPM.\n\nPartner with Optimize Health to expand RPM and its ability to combat SDOH\n\nSDOH is a complex ecosystem, and RPM is one more tool to mitigate the impact of these on a patient’s health. Ensure you have an RPM partner to streamline and facilitate engagement.",

      "# [Revolutionizing Indoor Air Quality: How Smart HVAC Systems Optimize Health and Efficiency by Andrew Froehlich on 2024-10-10](https://www.buildings.com/resiliency-sustainability/health-wellness-iaq/article/55234100/revolutionizing-indoor-air-quality-how-smart-hvac-systems-optimize-health-and-efficiency)\nTechnology is advancing to the point where indoor air quality (IAQ) can rival outdoor air. To achieve this, however, it takes advanced HVAC systems that are continuously maintained for optimization. Fortunately, new technologies are assisting in our quest, making every breath while inside smart buildings a clean and healthy one.\n\nThe Importance of IAQ\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that “on average, Americans spend approximately 90 percent of their time indoors, where the concentrations of some pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than typical outdoor concentrations.”\n\nThese pollutants have been shown to affect our health and cognitive abilities. For business owners, poor air quality often translates into increased absenteeism, impacting their bottom line. Thus, the advantages of investing in modern HVAC systems that can optimize air quality can not only positively affect health concerns, but the operational productivity of occupants as well.\n\nHow Modern Smart HVAC Systems Work\n\nModern HVAC systems in smart buildings have the ability to adapt to external pollution levels and occupancy levels, which both play a critical role in delivering fresh air to all or portions of a facility. Advancements include:\n\nNew HEPA and Activated Carbon filter systems to remove microscopic containments and pollutants\n\nOn-demand ventilation systems that make adjustments in real-time\n\nUV light and electrical charge systems to kill pathogens and trap particles missed by filtration systems\n\nCorrosion-resistant heat exchangers to prevent air stream contamination\n\nMold and mildew prevention systems\n\nMulti-zone systems that allow for customized air quality adjustments based on occupancy\n\nAll the advancements and benefits found in modern smart HVAC systems come with one major drawback: they require constant upkeep and maintenance to achieve maximum results. This increase in maintenance may prevent building owners and operators from investing in them due to the perceived cost of hiring a team of HVAC professionals to monitor systems and keep them operating efficiently. Fortunately, technology is here to the rescue as well.\n\nSmart HVAC System Monitoring and Management\n\nLike modern automobiles with advanced fuel efficiency systems and electronics, they’ve become increasingly complex to maintain. The same is often said about smart building HVAC systems. But with the right monitoring and management tools in place, smart HVAC systems are easy to maintain.\n\nHere are a few examples of how technology keeps these systems operationally effective:\n\nSensor Technologies. IoT sensors that are strategically deployed within a building monitor various HVAC and air quality metrics, including temperature, humidity, O2/CO2 levels, and occupancy counts. This delivers real-time data that can be used within smart HVAC systems to make automated adjustments.\n\nCentralized monitoring and alerting. In most cases, HVAC control platforms can integrate with a Building Management System (BMS). Doing so allows for a wider range of information gathering and consolidation that delivers more accurate information on which to base HVAC changes.\n\nAI/ML Data Analysis. Collecting data is one thing, but figuring out what to do with the information is another. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) lets software make those decisions on your behalf. With a bit of fine-tuning within the HVAC orchestration platform, AI and ML can make the minor adjustments required to optimize air quality far better than could be accomplished with a team of HVAC technicians.\n\nSoftware-centric feature updates. The beauty of modern HVAC systems is that they’ve largely become software-centric. This means that the HVAC vendor can provide software updates to fix bugs and introduce new features that potentially deliver greater air quality improvements throughout the system’s operational lifespan.\n\nBreathtakingly Good Indoor Air Quality\n\nGiven the ongoing advancements in smart building technologies, intelligent HAVC systems is an area that delivers benefits to business owners/operators and their occupants. Owners and operators gain obligatory energy efficiencies while occupants improve their health and operational performance.\n\nIt’s a win-win situation for both.

      "# [HCPCS Code G0511: What FQHCs and RHCs Should Consider](https://blog.optimize.health/hcpcs-code-g0511)\nLast updated: Jan 23, 2024\n\nThis is the fourth in our series on remote patient monitoring billing codes, focusing on HCPCS code G0511. Check out Part 1, which covers CPT® Codes 99453 and 99454; Part 2, which defines CPT® codes 99457, 99458, and 99091; and Part 3, which addresses some of the most frequently asked questions regarding the remote monitoring CPT® codes.\n\nIn the world of remote care, many codes exist for reimbursements for these services through CMS and commercial insurers. Most are specific to the type of remote care, but G0511 is a unique code. It only applies to specific care organization types and spans different remote care programs. Here’s everything you need to know about it.\n\nWhat is HCPCS code G0511?\n\nHCPCS code G0511 applies to specific healthcare organizations—federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and rural health clinics (RHCs). Its official description is billing for “general care management, 20 minutes or more of clinical staff time for chronic care management services or behavioral health integration services directed by an RHC or FQHC practitioner.”\n\nWhat services can you bill G0511 for?\n\nAs of January 1, 2024, FQHCs and RHCs can bill remote physiologic monitoring which includes remote patient monitoring (RPM), remote therapeutic monitoring (RTM), chronic care management (CCM), and principal care management (PCM). The CMS 2024 Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) made the critical inclusion of G0511 for RPM. Historically, FQHCs and RHCs have not been able to receive reimbursement for RPM services from CMS.\n\nNew PFS rule includes G0511 billing for RPM\n\nThe new rule states that FQHCs and RHCs can bill the code multiple times in a calendar month if they meet requirements for underlying services. There also cannot be any double counting. For instance, those providing TCM (transitional care management) services and complying with all the rules while meeting the RPM criteria can bill G0511 twice.\n\nFQHCs and RHCs can provide all the services G0511 captures as long as they meet underlying requirements for each service and bill for all of them separately.\n\nRequirements for billing G0511\n\nGeneral requirements\n\nAt least 20 minutes of care coordination services related to RPM, RTM, CCM, or PCM.\n\nThe services must be under the direction of an FQHC or RHC billing provider\n\nThe care can be under the general supervision of an FQHC or RHC provider, meaning you can outsource this to a remote care company that offers clinical monitoring services by licensed nurses.\n\nCCM requirements\n\nFor CCM, the patient must have at least two chronic conditions expected to last 12 months or more and puts the patient at significant health risk. Additionally, providers must establish, implement, revise, and monitor a comprehensive care management plan.\n\nRPM requirements\n\nFor RPM, patients must take 16 or more days of readings in a 30 day period or 20 minutes of clinical monitoring with a synchronous interaction.\n\nMore things to know about billing G0511\n\nBilling for RPM and RTM separately is now possible.\n\nYou can bill code G0511 multiple times a month when you meet all requirements.\n\nThe 2024 non-facility payment national average is $72.98.\n\nTracking of time for each service is necessary for compliance.\n\nWhat are common chronic conditions that benefit from remote care programs?\n\nRemote care can encompass many chronic diseases that would be billable under G0511. Examples include:\n\nHypertension\n\nHeart disease\n\nChronic kidney disease (CKD)\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n\nObesity\n\nDiabetes\n\nFQHCs see a significant share of patients with chronic conditions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed that 22.6% of nonmetropolitan residents have 2-3 chronic diseases, nearly 4% higher than metropolitan ones.\n\nNonmetropolitan populations also had higher rates of high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, and COPD. These groups also had higher disease death rates for heart disease, strokes, and respiratory diseases.\n\nWith the high levels of multi-chronic patients, FQHCs and RHCs can make significant progress by offering remote care programs. The addition of G0511 as applicable to RPM and CCM creates considerable opportunities for better patient outcomes.\n\nBest practices for accurate and compliant billing of G0511\n\nIf you plan to launch an RPM program under G0511, here are some tips:\n\nUse patient-friendly connected devices.\n\nThe medical devices you supply patients with must be easy to use. They’ll learn about them during onboarding and education. Cellular devices are the most efficient, as they don’t require the patient to use their smartphone or download an app like Bluetooth. Cellular devices have broader coverage and are ready to use out of the box. Choosing cellular ensures greater consistency in patient vital transmission, especially for patients living in nonmetropolitan areas.\n\nPrioritize patient engagement for adherence.\n\nWith an RPM program, you’ll have a technology platform that enables direct communication between care teams and patients. They can receive automated reminders to take their readings daily. If patients forget to take readings, care teams can call or text them directly for additional reminders. This ecosystem ensures patients to actively participate in managing their health and make vital taking a habit.\n\nUse a solution with automation features.\n\nThe right RPM platform automatically tracks activities by clinical staff. It counts all the time and interactions for eligible interactions automatically to bill for G0511.\n\nLet RPM companies do the monitoring for you to decrease workload.\n\nEach patient enrolled in RPM programs requires monitoring, as readings could become urgent moments for intervention. An escalation framework must be in place, and you can access this with external clinical monitoring services carried out by licensed U.S.-based nurses. When readings go beyond a threshold, they will immediately alert attending physicians.\n\nFQHCs and RHCs can improve outcomes when partnering with Optimize Health\n\nThe new application of G0511 to RPM enables FQHCs and RHCs to expand remote care. By monitoring your most at-risk patients, you have the opportunity to gather data about their diseases and drive better clinical results.\n\nBuilding a program requires technology, services, and guidance. We can help with customized RPM and CCM programs for FQHCs and RHCs.
