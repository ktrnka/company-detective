This approach improves patient outcomes and their quality of life.\n\nOur intuitive remote patient monitoring software platform, monitoring services, and connected devices help you build and sustain a remote care program for a variety of high-risk patients. Through this united ecosystem of solutions, we enable a new level of connectedness between you and your patients.\n\nRemote care connects the dots between office visits. Closing this gap has positively impacts patient quality of life, decreasing your workload, offering a new revenue stream for your organization, and creating a more connected experience for your patients and the clinical team.\n\nOptimize Health was initially launched in 2015 in Seattle, Washington, to address gaps in care between in-person visits. Recognizing the impact our technology and clinical services had on practices and their patients, we expanded our offerings to specialize in remote care with monitoring and disease management programs.\n\nWe recognized that chronic condition patients had to track their vitals at home, which they often forgot. As a result, many preventable hospitalizations or emergency care occurred. Providers had blind spots in understanding how their patients were doing outside their exam rooms.\n\nThese challenges in healthcare were the catalyst for the birth of Optimize Health. We deliver technology that enables more visibility between office visits, empowers patients to be more engaged in their health, and supports physicians managing chronic conditions beyond practice walls.\n\nWe’re continuing to innovate and improve solutions to build a future of remote care. With our solutions, physicians are already making a difference in the lives of their patients.",

      "# [Optimize Health](https://optimize.health/blogs/)\nCCM Physician Type/Specialty RPM\n\nHow ACOs Can Leverage Chronic Disease Management Software\n\nFebruary is more than just a month of valentines—it’s a month dedicated to raising awareness about heart health in the United States. American Heart Month officially began in 1964 when President Lyndon B. Johnson issued a proclamation that brought awareness to heart disease, but the history of heart health dates back much further. From Fear of Heart Disease to Hope In 1921, heart disease became America’s leading cause of death and was typically viewed as a certain prognosis of death. However, six determined doctors refused this fate and founded the American Heart Association (AHA) in 1924. They were determined to find ways to understand, treat, and prevent heart disease through research and collaboration. In the late 1940s, raising awareness became a major priority for the AHA. While the AHA had some success, President Dwight Eisenhower’s heart attack in 1955 brought unprecedented national attention to cardiovascular health. At the time the concept of “risk factors” didn’t exist. Heart attacks “came out of nowhere” and the estimated death rate was 40%. His care, by today’s standards, was slow and ineffective. President Eisenhower instructed his press secretary and physician, Dr. Paul White to “tell them everything.” White capitalized on the opportunity to share with the American public steps they could take to reduce their risk and how heart attacks could be related to diet, exercise, alcohol, and tobacco. It was a major step towards overcoming the fear that a heart attack was a death sentence. With strong advocacy from the AHA, President Lyndon B. Johnson officially proclaimed February as American Heart Month on February 16, 1964. This wasn’t merely a symbolic gesture but a strategic initiative to combat what had become a national health emergency. With Awareness Comes Research and Innovation Since 1950, death rates from cardiovascular disease began to decline. Major innovations included: The first successful coronary bypass surgery in 1967 Development of cholesterol-lowering statins in the 1970s Introduction of advanced diagnostic and imaging techniques including electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms, cardiac computed tomography (CT), and blood tests in the 1980s A National Movement for Public Health Heart disease remains a critical health challenge with over 950,000 Americans dying from cardiovascular disease. Heart disease is still the #1 cause of death for men and women. Awareness of symptoms is critical as every one-minute delay in defibrillation can reduce the chance of survival by 10%. The AHA continues to be a driving force behind the month’s initiatives, developing educational programs, funding research, and creating public awareness campaigns that reach millions of Americans each year. The first Friday of each February is National Wear Red Day which raises awareness and support for heart disease. The goals of American Heart Month include: Helping the public understand heart health risk factors, including smoking and stress Driving awareness for heart-healthy lifestyle choices Raising funds for cardiovascular research Supporting preventative health strategies and early detection methods Modern Advances for Proactive Heart Health Today, American Heart Month continues to evolve. With rising obesity rates, sedentary lifestyles, and increased stress levels, the mission remains as crucial as ever. New drugs such as GLP-1s show promise for reducing heart attack and stroke in addition to helping patients lose weight and control their blood sugar levels. New care programs, including remote patient monitoring and chronic care management, can transform heart care from reactive to proactive. Embracing Heart Health Beyond medical achievements, American Heart Month has fundamentally changed how Americans perceive heart health. While heart disease was once considered an inevitable consequence of aging, we now know it is a preventable and manageable condition. Each February, we are reminded that heart health is not a passive experience but an active, ongoing commitment to living healthy. Optimize wants to support all practices and patients who want to take a proactive approach to heart health. Contact us to learn more about how RPM supports heart health.",

The data also becomes part of the patient’s electronic health record. Those readings can initiate alerts if they are outside of the thresholds that you set for patients. The data exchange occurs continuously.\n\nThe software automatically tracks the number of patient readings and the engagement time. Adding manual time spent on evaluations and consultations is also available. With sorting filters, you can view readings and engagement minutes by patient to determine who is on track to meet monthly billing requirements. The system also tracks whether the patient has completed the synchronous call requirement to bill. You can export all data identifying eligible patients from the billing tab to your billing system.\n\nOur software and all supporting services, including insurance eligibility verification, are HIPAA compliant. Our software uses the agile methodology, so we can quickly integrate the latest CMS guidelines into the platform. This ensures you are always compliant and have a complete audit trail if needed.",
      "# [Remote Patient Monitoring Devices on 2023-11-02](https://optimize.health/connected-devices/)\nAll devices we provide are FDA-approved. The agency has many protocols to ensure they are safe to use. Additionally, manufacturers must have provisions in place for data security to mitigate the risk that’s inherent with internet-connected devices. The security guidelines also adhere to HIPAA compliance mandates.\n\nOnce devices are on your network, data encryption, cybersecurity best practices, compliance, and privacy regulations remain a priority.\n\nCellular connectivity and Bluetooth are the most common ways to connect devices online. If using a cellular network, there’s no need for a smartphone, which is a Bluetooth requirement.\n\nConnecting via Bluetooth can also be cumbersome for patients because they need to “pair” the device and their phone. Reliable and uninterrupted internet access is a requirement for Bluetooth, while cellular has broader coverage and is the easiest to set up. The device is ready right out of the box.\n\nOnce you implement our RPM software, you will work with our implementation experts to order the relevant FDA-compliant connected devices. We can deliver them directly to patient homes. After training and implementation, data begins to transmit from the devices to your RPM platform. Your program for remote care is ready, with accurate and reliable data at your fingertips.",

      "# [Our New Mission and Vision](https://blog.optimize.health/ourmissionandvision)\nAs a marketing leader, few things can stop me in my tracks like a good, simple message. Whether it is a tagline, campaign, or vision statement, seeing or hearing something that has the power to move hearts and minds is a skill that I deeply admire.\n\nI’ve spent most of my career in healthcare, and am asked a surprising amount why I’m so committed to this industry when I could work on things like craft beer or cryptocurrency rather than CPT codes.\n\nThe fact is, whether we like it or not, we are all healthcare consumers at some point during our lives. Whether it’s due to an accident, a chronic condition, a check-up, or a sports injury from a flag football league that they swore was “recreational,” each of us has visited a doctor, gone to urgent care or the ER, or needed care from a doctor or specialist.\n\nThe problem is–accessing care can be incredibly difficult.\n\nAs Todd Haedrich, CEO at Optimize Health has noted, traveling to the doctor can take as much as two hours for people who live in healthcare deserts. This is an even greater burden for those who already live on the margins, and who have to decide between taking unpaid time off to make that visit, or waiting until their health becomes critical. Concurrently, healthcare providers are trying to meet every person’s care needs through office visits alone, and we're trying to solve an escalating problem with the same solution as we did decades ago.\n\nTo support the current number of adults in the U.S. with at least one chronic condition—think hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, or obesity—requires physicians and specialists find an extra 10.6 hours per day, or an extra 2,500 hours per year if they continue to treat patients with in-office visits alone.\n\nI'm a proud English major, but I have enough math sense to know this problem + solution set is never going to add up.\n\nThe great thing about our remote care solution is that it completely flips the script.\n\nWe’re no longer talking about how trying to add more hours to the day or how to add more patients into each office visit (as if we could), but showing providers and patients that they can flex the time available outside of office visits to give and receive the right level of care at the right time.\n\nThink about it: if you're a physician with 8 office visits available each day, and have some patients who need simple questions answered and some patients who are having critical health issues, would you want to wave a magic wand to know who you should see in office, and who can be supported through less time intensive channels? And if you're a patient who can save that two hours of travel time by getting a phone call from your clinical team to tell you that your blood pressure is looking good and you're doing well, wouldn't you want the same empowerment?\n\nThis is the level of insight Optimize Health's remote care solution provides our clients and their patients: organization, prioritization, and above all, continuous connection.\n\nWhen we started researching and building our remote care platform, our ethos was guided by the simple idea that our technology should make it easier for people to help people.\n\nAs we refreshed our brand’s visual design to highlight how we help providers to build deeper bonds with their patients, we also revisited our narrative identity too. Why? Because our shift from a single, RPM-only solution to the single operating system for all remote care changed the scope of who we could help. We were no longer just focused on the benefits to providers and clinical teams, but solving how to re-center the rich relationships between patients and providers, no matter where they are, and codify this into our solution and services.\n\nNew Mission, New Vision, Same Excellence\n\nThere’s no doubt: we have the premier remote care technology, and are forging a future for healthcare delivery and accessibility that other companies are just beginning to reckon with.\n\nAs I started reshaping our mission and vision, I wanted it to be as powerful and responsive as our remote care platform. We spoke with our leaders, our staff, our clients and their patients, and the key theme we kept hearing was potential. Potential for better care. Potential for better lives. Potential to revolutionize the quality and quantity of patient and provider interactions outside the four walls of the practice.\n\nNow, as we delivered the single operating system for all remote care, we seized that potential and forged it into a reality where better outcomes, better conversations, and better lives are possible for anyone.\n\nPut simply: we are freeing patients and providers from a proximity model to a reality where care is a part of people’s daily lives–not just a few times a year.\n\nToday, I’m proud to share Optimize Health’s new mission and vision that reflects our solution and the possibilities for patients and providers alike.\n\nOur mission: We are on a mission to transform how medical groups use technology and real-time data to treat patients outside the practice walls. As a leader in remote care solutions, we help medical groups deliver proactive care that re-centers the patient and provider relationship and improves patient outcomes and their quality of life.\n\nOur vision is as powerful as it is simple: Powering better outcomes for anyone, anywhere.\n\nWith our vision for remote care, RPM is repositioned as a pillar program alongside other key remote care programs, including chronic care management (CCM), principal care management (PCM), remote therapeutic management (RTM), and more to fundamentally improve the accessibility and responsiveness of healthcare.\n\nPatients can now receive care during their daily lives from their providers and clinical teams in real-time. It’s the difference of proactive care and reactive care, and how the smallest changes can make a big difference in people’s lives.\n\nI’ve had the tremendous privilege of hearing from our clients and their patients about how their lives have improved through remote care. We have a number of success stories, but one that has always stuck with me came from Kimberly Novak, practice manager at Kentucky Cardiology. There was a patient with hypertension who was too nervous to travel in case she needed critical care. But after being enrolled in RPM, she finally felt safe enough to fly out of state to visit her daughter because her doctor would receive her readings in real-time, and could intervene before anything became critical.\n\nThese are the stories that power our mission and vision.",

      "# [Q&A with Optimize Health Co-Founder, Jeff LeBrun](https://blog.optimize.health/qa-jeff-lebrun)\nJeff LeBrun is the Co-Founder of Pillsy and Optimize Health. After serving as CEO for 6+ years, Jeff recently shifted to a new role as Executive Chairman and Chief Strategy Officer. We asked Jeff a few questions about the origins of the company, the future of RPM, and why he is so passionate about RPM in our “Meet Jeff” blog post.\n\nYou have been involved with multiple start-ups over the course of your career. What was the motivation for starting Pillsy and how did the universe lead you to your co-founder, Chuks Onwuneme?\n\nThe idea for Pillsy evolved from a couple of different startups over the course of my career. At one of these startups, I was supporting some of the early wearable device companies. Interest in these devices grew as the companies began connecting them to the internet. It was easy for me to imagine the potential applications in healthcare and the value of continuous medical data.\n\nI also started a VC-backed biotech startup in graduate school, where I quickly learned how significant of a problem medication adherence is in the US. Only 50% of prescribed medications are taken appropriately. This leads to 125,000 lives lost unnecessarily and costs the healthcare system about $300 billion annually. Those facts blew me away, so I naturally started thinking about solutions. Having followed products like Fitbit from their pre-launch, I started to think about the potential impact of that kind of technology approach.\n\nAround that same time, I developed an allergy to my new puppy and started taking an allergy pill prescription. While I think of myself as a relatively competent person, I still found it difficult to develop a new routine around taking the pill.\n\nWith this work history experience and my own personal experience, I began reading about the “Nudge” and “Hooked” concepts in the newest behavioral science books. I became very interested in applying the work I did with the early wearables to medication adherence. The initial concept was creating a Fitbit-quality experience for people taking medications. By using similar design principles and the new (at the time) Bluetooth Low Energy technology, I knew there was potential to help people develop healthier habits that ultimately saved lives.\n\nI met Chuks through the startup community in Seattle. We started hanging out together and building some things, initially just for fun. I was taking a year off to focus on learning, including UX design and coding classes, so I made it a goal to create a Bluetooth-enabled medication adherence product. After some market research revealed enough consumer demand, we decided to go for it and Pillsy was born.\n\nYou shifted the focus of the company from Medication Adherence to RPM when CMS introduced reimbursement for RPM. But now, with RTM it looks like reimbursement for Medication Adherence could be in the foreseeable future. How could that impact Pillsy?\n\nI like to joke that we were about 5-7 years ahead of the market for Pillsy. In healthcare, sometimes it takes longer to get your product covered by payers even when there is legitimate demand and clear clinical benefit. In addition to navigating the bureaucracy of big payers, there are often other interests being protected that can slow down the process.\n\nBut eventually, healthcare can change for the better. And in this case, reimbursement for technology-enabled medication adherence will be huge.\n\nThinking about it another way, with all the changes that we’ve seen over the past 20 years, will the de-facto format for delivering medications still be plastic orange bottles in another 20 years? Let’s hope not. Orange bottles weren’t actually designed for patients. They were designed 40-50 years ago to streamline work for the pill-filling machines. And while they might save 45 cents of labor per fill, they are horrible to use, which contributes to the non-adherence problem.\n\nAt a certain point, the industry has to acknowledge how bad the existing medication delivery experience and ensuing outcomes are for the majority of people. It’s just a matter of time.\n\nIn the pharmaceutical world, drugs for chronic diseases are mostly commoditized generics. That means for 98% of the drugs dispensed, there is no differentiation on the actual drug being sold. However, there is plenty of room to differentiate on experience, or to go “beyond the pill” as many pharma people like to say. With technology, it’s possible to provide a digital coach that goes beyond the initial prescriber and the pharmacist to provide continuous 24/7 support. It could save tens of thousands of lives every year.\n\nYour LinkedIn tagline says you are “Building the Future of Continuous Remote Care”. What does that mean and how does it go beyond RPM?\n\nToday’s care is mostly episodic in nature, meaning that visits happen infrequently in the clinic. That has shifted to some degree post-COVID, but I think there is a realization that we have the technology to extend care beyond the four walls of a medical practice. Demand for these types of experiences is growing and they can provide superior clinical outcomes as well as improve overall quality of life for many patients.\n\nI’ve been known to say that remote patient monitoring is to remote care as books were to Amazon’s e-commerce business. It’s a great place to start, but it’s not necessarily the end game. I think people and practitioners want a single trusted partner to handle the bulk of their remote care interactions. It’s our goal to be that partner.\n\nOptimize Health recently hired a new CEO. What does Todd bring to the future of Optimize Health?\n\nHaving spent 10 years at athenahealth, Todd has amazing experience leading large teams and scaling digital health companies in our space. I’ve been successful as an innovator and an executor, but doing it at that scale like Todd is not something I’ve done. It’s a great combination.\n\nThe RPM field was really new when you started Optimize Health and it’s become an increasingly crowded field. How does Optimize Health stand out and how do you plan to stay ahead of the competition?\n\nThere’s a saying that if you don’t have any competition you should be worried. When we started out, I found that a big part of our initial job was educating people on the market itself. We used to have to prove that reimbursement was real by showing an Explanation of Benefits to practices. At this point, RPM is no longer a secret, especially with COVID dramatically accelerating the adoption of telehealth. More people are looking to provide these services and get reimbursed for them.\n\nWe are staying ahead by consistently improving and innovating. And, of course, we need to measure those improvements. In addition, we’ve developed a reputation for delivering on what we say we’ll deliver on. In this business, execution is the name of the game, and something that sounds too good to be true usually is.\n\nWe focus on executing and delivering value to our customers and patients. At the end of the day, we know our true mission is about improving patient care. That’s more important than beating our competitors, but putting patients and providers first will ultimately allow us to continue to outperform the other players.\n\nPersonally, I pick one thing that I want to improve on every day, week, and month. I write it down and I dedicate time to doing that, whether it’s through reading, coaching, or whatever. That goes for the individual Optimizers too; we encourage everybody to define and work on their own personal development goals.\n\nThe University of Michigan (Go Blue!) is well known for producing great entrepreneurs. Tell us a little more about your startup mentorship with TechArb at Michigan and why it’s important to you.\n\nGo Blue!\n\nPrior to attending Michigan, I had started websites around travel and live music venues that got some traction. But, I didn’t really know what to do when I started getting calls from other startups and VCs who wanted to partner with me. Michigan is where I learned how to think about a business more systematically, and how to do some specific things like read a term sheet and make a cap table.\n\nWe’ve collaborated with Michigan students in several ways, from hosting interns through the Zell Lurie program (especially helpful in a rapid phase of growth after COVID), to sponsoring projects through the School of Public Health and the Ross Business School. The Social Venture Fund, which was started by a couple of my friends when I was in school, has also invested in TechArb, as did a fellow entrepreneur from the Wolverine Venture Fund.\n\nThis is important to me because I saw the advantages that other students had coming out of schools in the Bay Area or Boston, where there is more local access to entrepreneurship and to VCs. Michigan has a large community of alumni entrepreneurs, but there is no single physical nexus where we all reside.\n\nEntrepreneurship has become a significant part of my self identity, so it’s important to me to give back. Through mentoring and coaching, I try to help the super talented Michigan students and alumni who want to build new things and have a positive impact on the world. And, it’s always been a lot of fun and incredibly rewarding to watch their ideas come to life.",
      "# [RPM Can Improve Peritoneal Dialysis](https://blog.optimize.health/rpm-peritoneal-dialysis)\nClinical studies have shown that peritoneal dialysis (PD) for end-stage kidney disease has improved mortality rates, higher quality of life, and lower costs when compared with hemodialysis (HD). Yet, only 12.5% of all patients undergoing dialysis use PD. Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) has the potential to not only improve outcomes for PD patients, but also increase the patient utilization of PD.\n\nBenefits of Peritoneal Dialysis\n\nSome physicians and leading medical institutions such as the Mayo Clinic believe peritoneal dialysis has some benefits over traditional in-center hemodialysis, including:\n\nQuality of Life, Flexibility, and Independence: Because PD is done at home, patients aren’t tied to going to a dialysis center three times a week for 3-5 hours. PD is a continuous process and PD patients have the flexibility to work, travel, and life their daily lives with more freedom.\n\nLess Medication and Diet Restrictions. With continuous dialysis, less fluid and sodium accumulate which can reduce stress on a patient’s heart. This could result in less medications as well as the ability to eat more.\n\nLonger-lasting kidney function. PD may provide a “survival advantage” to end stage kidney patients, particularly in the first 1.5 – 2 years of dialysis.\n\nAdherence Challenges with Peritoneal Dialysis\n\nDespite these advantages,PD requires patient adherence to their treatment plan, including dialysis exchange, medication, and diet/fluid restrictions. A compilation of clinical studies found that non-adherence varied among patients but could be very high in some cases:\n\n2.6 – 53% for dialysis exchanges\n\n3.9 – 85% for medication\n\n14.4 – 67% for diet/fluid restrictions\n\nA research study that included structured interviews with clinicians revealed that beyond non-adherence, providers have concerns about at-home safety and potential catastrophic events with PD.\n\nWhy RPM is a Perfect Fit for Peritoneal Dialysis\n\nWhile monitoring vital sign data is a critical component of RPM, when executed well, RPM is about more than tracking data. RPM enables clinicians to build trusted relationships with patients where they are providing health coaching, education, and accountability. This type of continuous relationship is exactly what peritoneal dialysis patients need to ensure they are adhering to their treatment plan and feel confident in delivering their own dialysis.\n\nRPM with connected blood pressure devices and weight scales can provide the care team with daily information on blood pressure and body weight trends. As such, these devices can help detect fluid build-up and early signs of deteriorating organ function. With RPM, PD patients are no longer on their own to figure things out as they have daily support from their care team members.*\n\nRPM and Peritoneal Dialysis Results\n\nNumerous clinical studies have linked RPM with positive results for PD patients. One study reported that RPM resulted in a significant reduction in:\n\nPatient drop-out and technique failure\n\nScheduled and unscheduled hospital visits\n\nEpisodes of overhydration\n\nRate of hospitalization\n\nEpisodes of non-compliance to prescription\n\nPatient and hospital team time spent in traveling and management of therapy\n\nHealthcare costs and patient's expenditure\n\nMiles traveled by patients for hospital care\n\nWith these results, it’s clear RPM can lead to more successful results for PD patients. Clinicians have a greater ability to monitor patient adherence to PD treatment, resulting in greater confidence in recommending PD to more patients.\n\nReady to Learn More?\n\nRead how Kidney Disease Consultants, an Optimize Health client, decreased hospitalizations and the progression of chronic kidney disease with RPM. Or, if you want to talk to an RPM expert about how your practice could improve patient outcomes and satisfaction with RPM schedule a free consultation.\n\n*Optimize RPM Services are not intended to provide emergency services.

      "# Post ID birz8u: Best way to do running for maximal health and longevity, not competition. with +19 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/)\nI want to get into running (or jogging), but purely as a part of the many lifestyle choices involved in maximizing the health benefits to minimize the chance of developing diseases.  The reason I make this distinction is that competition is usually not the way to optimize health, and I've heard that marathon-running is at a point where it's not maximally healthy.  If that's what most people are into here, that's fine and dandy, but that's not what I'm personally looking for.\n\nSo if my only goal is to be maximally healthy, how exactly should I be incorporating running?  How many times a week?  Is 3-4 consecutive days good (the other days I lift and want to conserve energy)?\n\nMale / Age 21\n\n## Comment ID em2p8mk with +19 score by [(malface7931, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em2p8mk/) (in reply to ID birz8u):\nFrom what I understand of cardio health, running approx. 5km at a decent pace at least 4 days a week would give you quite a good level of cardio health without stressing your body.

Love it.\n\n### Comment ID em3im5k with +4 score by [(SarcasticMethod, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em3im5k/) (in reply to ID em2p8mk):\nI think you are right. My routine is similar to what you mention, but I throw in a long run of at least 10 km once a week. This helps as a base for race season for me, so that I'll have a stronger base to start off training with. Races are great motivation, but I never aim to compete against anyone but myself--namely, my past self. (These last bits are anecdotal, of course.)\n\nHowever OP, I would not run 4 consecutive days. You need some rest days (or cross-training, too) in between runs. They say these rest days are when your body really works to build your strength. For example, I might run Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday.\n\n## Comment ID em31y9d with +24 score by [(tdammers, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em31y9d/) (in reply to ID birz8u):\nScience doesn't have a definitive answer for you here, but we do know a few things.\n\nFirst; \"more is more\", but not linearly so - that is, running twice as much does not produce twice the health benefits, rather maybe like 110-120% or so (I'm making this figure up, for illustrative purposes - main takeaway is that it's sublinear). Whether there is a maximum volume after which health benefits go down again is still a controversial question; some studies seem to support this hypothesis, but flaws have been pointed out in all of them so far.\n\nThen, a very important variable is training. 30 miles per week is \"maintenance\" for me, while for a brand new runner it'd be way above their abilities, and for an elite marathoner it would essentially be a week off. It's all relative, training above your level isn't sustainable, but as you adapt to training, your limit will shift, and what is a reasonable volume depends on that.\n\nGiven all this, there is no clear answer, because it depends on so many things. What can your body handle naturally? What's your running fitness like? What kind of injury / overtraining risk are you willing to accept? How hard are your workouts?\n\nThere is not anything fundamentally unhealthy about running marathons; problems arise when people *race* them, pushing their limits - as with any sport, doing that comes at a risk, and while the risks of running long distance may be different than those seen in other sports, the reason people get hurt has little to do with the distance per se. If you are trained for it and go at a pace that is well within your comfort zone, then even ultramarathon distances aren't really all that hardcore. I've done 10k races that were definitely harder on my body than some 30-40 mile runs I've done at a comfortable (as far as such a thing as \"comfort\" exists past mile 20) pace. Humans have run much longer distances than that throughout history; even the legenday Pheidippides, who inspired the Marathon as a discipline, didn't just run from Marathon to Athens (~25 miles) - he ran from Marathon to Sparta (some 120 miles) in one day, then back the next day, then participated in the battle, and THEN he'd run to Athens, where he collapsed from exhaustion (but probably survived - the dying part may be just poetic hyperbole). So not \"25 miles and then death\", but \"almost 300 miles and a battle, and he still made it\". And he was just doing his job; Greek armies employed professional runners who would routinely run upwards of 100 miles in a day as part of their jobs.\n\nSoooo... what do?\n\nBasically, if you want to run for health, and have your strength covered with lifting, then I'd recommend starting with some beginner program (couch to 5k, a.k.a. c25k, is good), and from there, gently work your way up to where you can comfortably run for an hour or so, at a leisurely pace, a couple times per week (putting you in the 3-5 hours per week range). It seems that this is approximately where the cost / benefit ration of maintaining the required training volume starts shelving off - you still get upwards of 90% of the health benefits, and if trained properly, a very very small risk of serious damage or injury. \"Every other day\" seems like a decent balance to me - for a beginner, more days may be too taxing, and later it may not be worth pushing for more, especially if you also do other exercise.\n\n\"Conserving energy\" is not a concern btw; lifting doesn't burn that much, and taps into different energy sources (slow running is mainly fat and some glycogen, but you need to keep going for about 3 hours or so to make a serious dent in your glyco stores), while lifting mainly runs on ATP, and gets refilled from available carbs (but you can never possibly lift enough to deplete the glyco stores). So if you \"run out of energy\", what really happens is that your muscles aren't recovered yet. But if you run at a truly slow pace, and lift heavy (hi-res, lo-rep), then you will almost exclusively recruit slow-twitch fibres for running, and fast-twitch for lifting. OTOH, if you run too fast, running will use fast-twitch too, and the result is slow progress on the running front, and jelly legs when lifting after running.\n\n### Comment ID em34zlw with +5 score by [(OracleOfOntario, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em34zlw/) (in reply to ID em31y9d):\nwow, great post, that's some sage advice.\n\n## Comment ID em2okkw with +11 score by [(ithinkitsbeertime, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em2okkw/) (in reply to ID birz8u):\nThe CDC says:\n\n>For substantial health benefts, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) to 300 minutes (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes) to 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity.  \n>  \n>Preferably, aerobic activity should be spread throughout the week.

The border between Z1 and Z2 representing the first lactate turnpoint \\~ 2mmol. The border between Z2 and Z3 representing the second turnpoint \\~ 4mmol.In this model, Zone 2 would be similar to a Zone 3 (on a Five Zone scale) - correlating with somewhere around 80-85% of Max HR.\n\nIn any case, I don't know if I have misinterpreted the question, but it seems many replies have read the question differently than I.\n\nThe subject is asking if \"cardio is necessary\", but the main body implies if high intensity cardio is necessary, or if his long walks are adequate.\n\nI'm still new to this subject as a whole but I've immersed myself in it over the past six months, digesting hours of content from Peter Attia, Mike Joyner, Andy Gaupin, Huberman, Stephen Seiler, etc. Stephen in particular has a lot of specialised content on youtube focusing on this, and \"how low is too low\" intensity wise.\n\nI'd direct you to this chart ([https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/coggan-s-physiological-adaptation-chart/75468](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/coggan-s-physiological-adaptation-chart/75468)) which shows the different adaptations (or lack thereof) that happen during cardio at different intensity.\n\nReally, if your goal is to improve VO2 max -- long walks are not adequate. That doesn't mean you wont enjoy those walks and still burn calories - but it won't do wonders for VO2max. That chart will loosely illustrate the amount of Vo2 max improvements you'll get from each intensity level - as well as a plethora of other adaptations that occur. It's quite informative. (I focus on Vo2 max purely as that's typically touted as one of the best predictors of longevity as a whole, but there are tons of other benefits from high intensity cardio).\n\nA simple cardio workout routine (which has worked for me, improving my 5K time from over 30 minutes to less than 19 minutes across a four month time span) has been:\n\n3 x \"Zone 2\" runs (based on the 5-HR Zones) for 45-75 minutes per run (dependent on how much time I have - more the better)  \nand  \n1 x \"Vo2 max protocol\" - my preference is 1km repeats (running at 95% effort for 1km) with a 1:1 rest recovery ratio. Repeat this 5-6 times, with 1.5km warm up.  \n\n\nIf I get time for another run, I'll typically throw in a Tempo or Threshold Run (eg. running for 5-10K at 90% of max HR).\n\nThat improved my Vo2 max from 35 (estimate) to 55 (estimate) across those same four months. (Estimate based on the average of both Apple Watch and the vo2 max estimate that the Cooper Test (12 minute run) formula spits out).\n\n## Comment ID k92m2md with +10 score by [(eat_natural, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k92m2md/) (in reply to ID 17ub1wx):\nIt’s my understanding that cardiorespiratory fitness has distinct health benefits over weight resistance training. While there are overlapping benefits between the two, cardiorespiratory exercises have a stronger beneficial impact on vascular health by improving the amount of nitric oxide present, blood vessel responsiveness to nitric oxide, and thus, a lower resting blood pressure. Beyond that, there is evidence to suggest that endothelial integrity is improved with a lower likelihood of lipoprotein penetration into the endothelium. Separately, there is also evidence that running stabilizes pre-existing atherosclerotic plaque and also reduces plaque volume / size. Angiogenesis is another benefit, where additional blood vessel growth occurs, while also dilating and enlarging existing blood vessels. There is evidence that endurance training reduces risk of sudden cardiac death from arrhythmia. Endurance training has a more significant impact on cardiac function, such as stroke volume, as well as VO2 max. It is my understanding that VO2 max is the strongest predictor of longevity, more so than insulin resistance, hypertension, obesity, etc.  Both weight resistance training and endurance training improve glucose and lipid metabolism. \n\n[Exercise benefits in cardiovascular diseases: from mechanisms to clinical implementation. Pedro L. Valenzuela.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37005351/)\n\nTo answer your question specifically, if you’re lifting hard enough at a high degree of effort and intensity, you will probably derive some of the above benefits. I do believe you would obtain additional benefit by incorporating some endurance training. Hopping on the stairclimber at the gym may be a practical way to build lower strength while incorporating endurance training.\n\n### Comment ID k95ka8m with +1 score by [(toothmanhelpting, Reddit, 2023-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k95ka8m/) (in reply to ID k92m2md):\nTo sum it up….

Doing things that improve your heart health is probably a good way to improve health span.\n\nI think the reason people don't like cardio is because they buy into the \"no pain, no gain\" mentality.\n\nFor example, embracing long duration zone 2 isn't really that \"intensive\". I think it can actually be boring...so I tend to do it on an indoor bike while playing video games.\n\nI don't do the high intensity intervals as described by Attia. Instead, I've been doing clean and jerks with double kettlebells 3 days a week (modified version of Geoff Neupert's Long Cycle of Death program). About 100 reps spread over 30 minutes in various rep schemes. Lots of time in Zone 5, but with work periods on the order of 15-30 seconds (depending on rep scheme) and similar rest periods. But each workout has 30-40 sets depending on the rep scheme.\n\nSo not the prescription Peter gives, but my guess is that it's fine provided I'm not trying to be an elite cyclist. And it's way easier on my knees than sprinting. Seems to me like a great combination of strength and cardio. It's the only workout where I really get that \"runner's high\".

No one knows when your first lactate turnpoint occurs (it's individual). This is technically when you cross over from Zone 2 to Zone 3. This is typically correlated with 65-80% of max HR - but everyone's will actually be different. But if you reach that range with brisk walking, then yes - Zone 2 can be achieved.\n\nHowever as you get fitter, you will notice you can now maintain the same pace as before, but at a much lower heart rate - meaning you will have to increase the intensity to stay in that zone. Whether this is simply ramping up the incline %, or if you need to up the pace to a slow jog.\n\nMost people will sustain Zone 2 with a slow jog - you definitely do not have to \"run\" to stay in Zone 2 (subjective - if you're fit enough to run fast relative to others in Zone 2, you probably still don't perceive that run as a fast run, since you'd be capable of running even faster I guess!).\n\nFor me, when I first started cardio six months ago. Here's some stats for comparison:\n\nApril 19th, 2023. \"Zone 2 run\" (My Max HR is 199. Zone 2 for me is estimated at 128-160)4KM was at Zone 2 (about 30 mins) and the last 1KM was at a faster pace.\n\n1KM, 6:34, 154 HR1KM, 7:07, 160 HR1KM, 7:30, 154 HR1KM, 6:35, 154 HR1KM, 5:39, 167 HR\n\nSo that average pace of around 6:30 minutes per KM, kept me in Zone 2.\n\nHowever fast forward six months, I now need to run at around 5:00-5:15 per KM to stay in the same HR zone. Back when I started, 1 KM at 5:00 was the same time as my max 1km effort! Now I can sustain this for 15+km IN \"zone 2\" heart rate range...\n\nTL;DR - You could sustain a Zone 2 workout with brisk walks, but as your fitness improves, walking pace may no longer be sufficient.\n\nStephen Seiler has an interesting youtube video on low intensity, and \"How low is too low\" eg. Zone 1 vs Zone 2. Would recommend a lot of his content too!\n\n## Comment ID l92ehfi with +1 score by [(gettotea, Reddit, 2024-06-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/l92ehfi/) (in reply to ID 17ub1wx):\nBookmark\n\n## Comment ID lvvsfev with +1 score by [(ThatFaithlessness545, Reddit, 2024-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/lvvsfev/) (in reply to ID 17ub1wx):\n100% without a doubt, look at the most healthy fittest aged population amd what they do.\n they are soo fit and healthy still at their age because they do regular cardio not just weights.\n\n\nYou look at people who only lifted weights for most of their lives and they are either very imobile from not moving their body, they have heart issues and are overweight because all the muscle has gone and they put on alot of fat or they're dead if they were taking drugs or just eating too much all the time trying to bulk up, \n\n\nThat puts alot of pressure on your heart amd other organs while cardio gets your blood circulating, joints lubricated, keeps your brain sharp, flushes your system, improves digestion, burns alot of calories, etc. All of which weight lifting only does a fraction of if any\n\n\nDo both in balance,\n\n\nMuscle growth is cool and all but not at the expense of your overall health and well-being especially into later years\n\n## Comment ID k92v3mv with +1 score by [(medhat20005, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k92v3mv/) (in reply to ID 17ub1wx):\nIf the goal is to \"optimize health and longevity,\" I would guess (really, it's all somewhat educated guessing anyways) that more, but not too much more, than long slow walks would derive most of the benefits of a more structured zone 2 workout several times a week.

The sauna itself does not work miracles, even if the Finns say so.\n\nSauna is like meditation, going to sauna and having those \"healing\" benefits (mental) requires the right state of mind, practice and peace of mind.\n\nIf you are clinically anxious or depressed, you may not have enough peace of mind to have fully relaxing sauna experience, but still it might help little.\n\nThe shock of a sauna and cold water or snow, can take a depressed person away from that horrible feeling of anxiety for a while, but unfortunately it doesn't fix anything in long run. Sauna can help recovery from mental challenges if there are other means involved, such as therapy, exercise, diet and possibly medication.

I've found various specific goals intensely motivating over the years: front/back splits, certain partner moves, handstands. I've performed a few times at student shows, but I'm really more into training. It helps to have friends who are doing the same things. There are injuries, but I'd rather deal with the occasional musculo-skeletal thing than the problems you get from disuse.\n\nI live in the city with no car and walk a lot, which sounds like nothing but actually keeps my cardio health at an okay level.

Joint pain or back pain comes from one of two things for me. When I stop working on flexibility, or putting on extra weight. It's not really age that causes those pains in your 30's/40's. Or rather, the pains are not inevitable. It's a matter of \"use it or lose it\" and not balancing out sedentary life with active muscle building and flexibility.\n\nFoam rolling and stretching goes a long way along with exercise to \"reset\" my body and prevent the aches and pains. Yoga has been one of the best things for all of my little pains in the ass (and legs, and shoulders, and neck), by far.\n\n### Comment ID jlu7a3d with +114 score by [(tuxette, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlu7a3d/) (in reply to ID jltr69o):\n>  never stop working out\n\nThis. \n\nNever stop.

It doesn't take much at all to maintain muscle!\n\n### Comment ID jlwm29f with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlwm29f/) (in reply to ID jlu268u):\nThis is so real. I would add that having balance and flexibility are also important for aging, but I only started to feel “fit” when I started lifting heavy weights. \n\nAlso, I personally find that weight lifting is a lot less unpleasant to start doing compared to say, HIIT. Once you learn proper form, it’s just about gradually increasing from there. Whereas a burpee has always sucked no matter how strong I get, IMHO.\n\n### Comment ID jlyss5r with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlyss5r/) (in reply to ID jlu268u):\nMy motto is that if I can't lift *myself*, I'm in trouble. This bears out with what I've witnessed in the older women in my life. The ones who are able to do daily planks and squats are in general more mobile, and those who can't lift themselves out of a chair are...obviously not. So I try to do body weight exercises every day, if I'm not just heaving myself around as a matter of course. Having a garden is great for that. In the spring and summer I spend at least an hour a day bending, lifting and squatting. I would imagine running around after small children achieves the same effect :)\n\n## Comment ID jltr8hz with +83 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltr8hz/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nFind something you enjoy.

As women age hormonal changes make us lose muscle easily and it’s harder to put back on. Over time this has an effect on our hormonal balance, our bone density and it also is a main cause of the slowing of our metabolism. A lot of women get overly focused on cardio for weight loss, but running really messes you up over time, it wears out all of your joints. Cardiovascular health *is* important but maintaining muscle mass is imperative. If you want cardio, focus on something low impact that also builds strength (swimming is the best in my opinion. Bike riding and hiking are good too.) get out in nature, it positively effects your blood pressure and stress levels, which in turn will keep your weight down and your heart healthy (stress has a lot of systemic consequences including weight gain). \n\nNutrition: throw out diet culture. Eat balanced, regular meals. Balanced means a protein a fat a carb and a fruit/vegetable. That is a meal. Try to eat at least three of those a day, more if you are still hungry. Emphasize protein to keep your muscle up. If you want dessert, eat it. Let go of food rules and focus on nourishment instead of deprivation. \n\nBest long term exercise for supporting these goals in my opinion: swimming, bike riding, yoga (unless you are hyper-mobile) pilates, weight lifting, dance (GREAT for your long term cognitive health), aerial acrobatics (I do pole dancing, HELLO upper body and core strength!), WALKING IS SO UNDERRATED, hiking, cross country skiing, snow shoeing I’m sure I can come up with more but really, find something relatively low impact that you genuinely enjoy doing, that’s the key. Consistency will win out against perfection every day of the week. It’s about building small habits and stacking them up over time.\n\n## Comment ID jlts7mb with +52 score by [(OnehappyOwl44, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlts7mb/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI have never restricted my diet in anyway.

There are no tricks to it. When I have the opportunity, I make sure to get movement in whether it’s walking or lifting weights. I don’t restrict my eating (but also am mindful of calories taken in…I just am not counting calories) and try to focus on getting healthy fats, protein, and carbs each day. I also value cooking and flavor and really just appreciate food. I’m currently pregnant for the first time and my body has definitely changed a lot through the process so far (which has been tough to be honest) but I still follow the same principles (as much as I can - which is definitely less than before pregnancy) but I plan to adhere to the same approach post-partum.  \n\nBiggest thing I can say is that WE are in charge of our health and can absolutely maintain and even optimize health and fitness in our 30s and beyond.

Love. It. And I definitely go through phases where I will eat more of it and of lesser quality than I should allow. \n\nBut I get back on track to healthy eating after a couple of weeks because that is what my body is used to, and I feel better doing it. My food habits include eating boiled eggs, roast chicken, baked fish, good quality canned tuna, lots of salad, sautéed spinach and other veg, low glycemic index fruit like blueberries, and some almonds. Whole wheat pasta, some lentils, too. I wash and cut up veg like broccoli and store it in a paper towel lined Pyrex dish in the fridge so it's grab and go. I'll bake a batch of chicken breast or thighs (skin off) and freeze on wax paper so it's easy to heat up when I need it. \n\nI walk a lot. I try to do 3.5 miles 3 to 5 times a week. I need to be lifting weights, and yoga makes me feel great when I do it. I like Bree and Flo short yoga classes (15-30 minutes) on YouTube. \n\nIMO, if habits are broken in then you're on autopilot and your body will gravitate to what it \"thinks\" it should be doing.

You don't need to go fully vegan/plant-based to have a solid diet and healthy weight, but it was something that became easy for me pretty quickly, and then it stuck for a variety of reasons. You can do a vegan diet and be unhealthy, true, but in general, it supports good health. Whatever works for you, get your diet sorted out to something you can sustain. \"Eat food, mostly plants, not too much\" is good advice and a good target. \n\nThen just keep moving. I rotate through hobbies and could never stick with a gym membership, but I just keep finding something to do. For some seasons of my life, that was climbing and yoga. In others, skiing and mountain biking. Another, road biking and weight lifting. Currently, hiking and paddle boarding/kayaking. Even just a solid hour-long evening walk or living room YT yoga session will serve you well. Strength training is important as you age too, but if it's between long evening walks and nothing, then go get that cardio in.\n\nSeparate from going vegan, I had to quit drinking when I realized it was a migraine trigger. I don't think being 100% sober forever is the only way to be healthy, but if you're in the habit of drinking regularly, it's probably a good idea to set it down and fix the 'habit' part. Alcohol really is poison (delicious poison, but poison nonetheless), and there are plenty of ways to supplant whatever health benefits they're trying to sell for it (antioxidants, etc). \n\nWhat motivates me is watching older people who pay little to no attention to their health act like health and mobility are completely out of our control and then endlessly complain as their health declines (kind of like the people who say things like \"you can't plan or really ever be 'ready' for kids lololol\" as if birth control and financial planning are things that do not exist). I also live in a place where you do see a lot of older people out hiking and biking - it's definitely possible to enjoy an active life in your later years, but it doesn't happen by accident. Not even *trying* to stay active and healthy is a sure ticket to pain and lower quality of life, so just keep getting back on the horse, no matter where you fell off. \n\nYou don't really get to choose your health problems, but you can choose how well you take care of yourself in spite of whatever challenges you face. Lots of people would hear \"vegan and no alcohol\" and assume it's no fun and a constant bummer, but it's really nice feeling healthy and not being hungover like, ever. And I'm a good cook, so being vegan doesn't rob me anything on that side of things. My quality of life is higher because of it, not lower.\n\n### Comment ID jlu5t5o with +3 score by [(plutonianbitch, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlu5t5o/) (in reply to ID jlts6qh):\nYes to all of this 💗\n\n## Comment ID jltqns2 with +116 score by [(freshie4o9, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltqns2/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nGenetics.

Had mine removed in 2019. The last eight months were the only times it’s been in range during lab work which I get done every 4-6 weeks because it’s never been steady since I had my thyroid out. That also corresponds to how long I’ve been on mounjaro. Not sure what steadied my thyroid levels out but something did. Since going on MJ my thyroid levels have been consistent, my insulin needs have decreased fifty percent and I’ve lost weight. It’s been a miracle drug for me. So I guess when they said having my thyroid out would be easy. I would just pop a pill every morning was somewhat true. I just need an injection and a pill.

Doing a squat or deadlift hits your body so much harder than something like leg extensions on a machine 2) just a high daily activity level is important.

Find what makes you feel happy and works do you. You cannot do it all at once, perfectly 100% of the the time. Be gentle with yourself. Don’t compare yourself to others. Don’t deprive yourself of foods you love, but think of adding in more healthy foods. I love fried chicken, but if I’m going to have it, I’ll have a salad or vegetable on the side. Try to move every day, but not every workout needs to be intense. Walking on off days can be a very good friend, and it gets you outside where you can calm your mind and focus on your surroundings. Sleep. Cutting back on alcohol has also worked really well for me. It’s all about incremental progress and sustainable habits. I’m feeling more motivated and stronger now at 36 than I did at 26. Looking forward to what my 40s can bring.\n\nEdit: Adding that it is hard to outwork a bad diet/high caloric intake with exercise. I took my overweight dog to the vet a few years ago, and he said, “It all starts at the food bowl.” I think about this all the time for myself.\n\n## Comment ID jluli0u with +5 score by [(wholeselfin, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jluli0u/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nFor me, 2 things helped:\n1.  Running.  I was lucky that this has been my exercise of choice, because it’s so much easier to motivate for and fit into a busy schedule and holes in the day than things that require going to a gym, wearing special clothes and equipment, meeting up with a partner or team.  You can really just put on your shoes and go. In a pinch, I’ve run in jeans and dresses. It’s available 24/7, from 30-95 degrees with proper adaptations (some people run much colder than this but I’m a cold weather wimp).  I keep a gym bag in my car and run during my kids’ activities.  I also have a big dog and run confidently with her after dark. \n2.  Having kids and keeping up with them.  When you go to the playground, don’t just sit and watch and catch up on your phone.  I am 50, my youngest is 9, and we do cartwheels, monkey bars, play basketball, I try to skateboard but that’s one thing I can’t keep up with.

For me it's triathlons. For someone else, it's barre class or yoga. Whatever keeps your body moving will 100% benefit you in the long run.\n\n\nStart incorporating weight lifting into your routine. You will NOT get bulky. You will build skeletol muscle that will help your body maintain its mobility and bone density as you age.\n\n\nSomeone else mentioned mobility. Keep up your stretching. Take care of your injuries. Do your physical therapy. Not only will these help you heal up faster if you do get injured, but they will help prevent further injury in the first place.\n\n\nAs for nutrition: 80/20. I eat healthy 80% of the time. The other 20% for me means pizza and a beer every single Friday, and 2 Dove chocolates after lunch and dinner. Do I have some unfortunate body fat? Yes. Is it biologically necessary for me as a woman to have body fat in the areas it's in? Also, yes.\n\n\nJust remember to keep thinking big picture.

It’s just that around 30, you begin to visibly see the ramifications of your lifestyle. Depending on your lifestyle—the rate of the body aging, weight gain, cognitive decline, all of it is significantly impacted. This should hopefully be empowering because it means we have more control over our personal health and fitness with age than is let on in the states.\n\nI first focused on my blood sugar regulation, as blood sugar spikes can cause gradual metabolic damage, inflammation and thus aging, and slowing the metabolism over time. This results in that stubborn fat that won’t move. Living a sedentary life (like sitting at a desk all day then sitting on the couch all night) also slows our metabolism, and this lowers our energy and efficiency with burning fat.\n\nHere in the states we’re led to believe caring about the blood sugar is only for people worried about diabetes.\n\nAll of this to say—regular walks, leading my meals with protein & fiber before my sweet treats (to prevent blood sugar spikes without restricting), eating fresh raw fruits& veggies when possible, and 3x/week cardio made a HUGE difference in my life.\n\n## Comment ID jltlhl2 with +13 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltlhl2/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nUhh...

Even when I travel I try to pack snacks instead of eating at the airport or on the road. 95% of the food I cook doesn’t come out of a box. I’m not cooking full, organic, fresh meals that have been kissed by the sun god or anything. Just pasta with carrots or fajitas or whatever. \nWhen I want a cookie, I eat a cookie. But I actively buy foods without added sugar. I also don’t eat if I’m not hungry and don’t feel bad if I overeat due to hormones. Which means the days before my period I’ll eat anything not still breathing. The days after, I could live off a yogurt and a handful of cashews. Also, I drink water with lemon and black coffee and never soda or sugary drinks. (And booze because of course)\n\nAs for working out, I work out so I can do the things I enjoy when I can actually do them. I love to hike and backpack, so I need to stay in shape year round so that when the time comes, I’m not struggling. I actually enjoy manual labor like working in the yard and shoveling snow so I lean into those when I can (who wants to move garden rocks with me this weekend!). I also walk whenever I can. Like, actually walk to the store or the bar or my friends houses if I can make it in a reasonable amount of time. When I worked in an office I always too the stairs, even when I worked on the 20th floor. \nI care more about my health than my looks. When I worked in an office I’d go to the gym for lunch and do a quick washcloth bath afterwards, never a full shower. I kept my hair simple and my makeup light because my lunch hour was too short to get in a good work out AND look pretty afterwards. \n\nI don’t workout as much as I did when I was younger but my goals have changed so that’s ok. But I just turned 40 and I can still do a couple of pushups and jog a mile without really trying.\n\n## Comment ID jltw23p with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltw23p/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nChoose activities you actually enjoy and would look forward to doing.

So think outside the box if you’re not a regular exercise person and want to become one. Walking is good too; that counts.\n\n## Comment ID jlu04sg with +8 score by [(buffy122988, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlu04sg/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nGenetics, genetics, genetics.

You must learn to be disciplined because you will not always be motivated. Consistency doesn’t mean perfection, but that you get it right most of the time. \n\nWeight training is important for women as we age because it, along with other factors helps prevent osteoporosis and other age-related issues. It will help you recover faster from injuries as well as help prevent them - of course as long as you use proper form and don’t lift too heavy of weights before you have built the strength to do so. \n\n Genetics plays a big role in how you age and what your body looks like, however eating a healthy diet of lean protein, veggies, carbs, and fats will give whatever genetics you have a boost. I know I will never have skinny legs, it’s just not in my genetics. If fat bottom girls make the rockin’ world go ‘round, my family is doing their part. I try not to beat myself up about it, which I will admit is sometimes really hard.  \n\nI cycle through periods of calorie restriction (fat loss) and maintenance, where I get to enjoy foods I love that aren’t healthy (but are good for the soul) - you can’t and shouldn’t live your life on a “diet” or in a state of calorie restriction for many reasons (quality of life, metabolic adaptation, etc.)  \n\nI leave room in my life for the good-for-the-soul foods most of the year, and restrict my calories for a short time when I feel I need to. I have been generally  able to keep visible abs year round without killing myself (again see my comment about genetics! And that wasn’t always the case!) I found an diet and exercise program that works for me (Renaissance Periodization). I lift weights and do some amount of cardio 5-6 days per week. I genuinely love lifting, I love how it has transformed my body and I love how strong I am. Lifting gives me a sense of accomplishment and makes me feel powerful. But I also know that not everyone loves lifting and that is totally ok. Find something you love and stick with it\n\nDrink water, get good quality rest, lift weights, eat (mostly) healthy, whole foods and stay consistent.\n\n## Comment ID jlvwzre with +2 score by [(Anna-Belly, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlvwzre/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nMovement!

So making sure you eat the right quantity for you in some form is key, whether that's keto, intermittent fasting, or just having a handle on your overall intake. Other than that,  focusing on building muscle through strength training also helps metabolism (and motivation because you'll feel strong). Protein intake helps build muscle so that's important too. And staying active with walking or other activity outside the gym.\n\nFor me the biggest motivator is finding a way to strength train that always has me chasing a little more - a new skill, a new PR, or even just moving the same weight but better. I work with a coach right now who programs for me in a way I like but there are tons of good online programs too. That chase keeps me really consistent because I like the feeling of always having something to work towards.\n\n## Comment ID jltu7st with +2 score by [(sittinginthesunshine, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltu7st/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI always stayed active by walking, but I truly got fit after 40!

It's absolutely not. I was a chubby child through my early teens. It took a concerted effort for me to lose weight in high school, which I did by walking and jogging a lot. It takes discipline and consistency for me to not regain weight.\n\nThe physique I have now is due to a combination of intense workouts and a great diet, but it' mostly my diet. I'm able to maintain my lean frame (just not my biceps) through just walking a lot (I have dogs) and eating intentionally.\n\nI intermittent fast (loosely) and do cardio at 6am on an empty stomach. I eat a green smoothie for lunch practically every day of my life unless I'm traveling. Then, I limit snacking in between meals. I'll have a *planned* snack or two in between lunch and dinner but I never graze. Dinner is a salad with lean protein several days per week, some type of burger (turkey/salmon/impossible, rarely beef) with salad or roasted veggies once or twice, then pasta or pizza with salad/roasted veggies the other days. This is the carb/calorie cycling method where I eat at maintenance or slightly under it based on my TDEE (google it) and then spike my carbs and calories a few days a week to refuel and stabilize hunger hormones, facilitate muscle growth and repair.\n\nYou have to care about and enjoy this stuff, however. I like being active, I find healthy food delicious, and I also like to eat huge portions, so intermittent fasting lets me do this without gaining weight. There's something to be said for finding what works for you, but as another commenter said, knowing your energy needs (i.e. how many calories and what nutrients your body requires to function) and meeting these, plus being physically active go a long way to keeping a person fit as they age. You just have to make it a priority which many people cannot or won't do, especially women. This goes double for moms, so it's worthwhile for me to acknowledge that I don't have kids and my body has never undergone pregnancy or childbirth.\n\n## Comment ID jluhpu0 with +2 score by [(Eva_De_Peva, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jluhpu0/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nFor me it has been playing capoeira, taking daily 30 minute lunch walks, and bikepacking.

Whether that's yoga, rebounding, walking, lifting etc. you will have a baseline no matter what. \n\nAnd then eliminating foods that don't serve you for more healthful whole options. Lots of fresh fruits and veggies-- remember muscles are built from glucose not protein. Less fats burdening your liver which starts to slow down now (leads to sluggishnness, weight gain and things we see as \"aging\").\n\nAnd lastly good sleep and good hydration!\n\n## Comment ID jlunudt with +2 score by [(HellGoddessHG, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlunudt/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI had twins and weighed 250.

The goal is to naturally transition into a whole foods way of eating such that it isn't a \"diet\". \n\nWalk 10,000+ steps a day most days.

Do NOT sit in a chair for 4+ hours straight. \n\nTake up some active hobbies that you can do after work and/or on weekends. Bouldering, cycling, hiking, running etc have relatively low barriers to entry and are more fun (to me) than the gym.

My dog is 15 and she still goes on walks every day and looks half her age and still gets puppy energy.

I’m a big believer in being able to eat what you want as long as you don’t eat too large of portions and having a variety of food. That’s when I feel my best. I’m an over eater by nature so I go through waves of it but I go crazy if I put huge limitations on myself. And weighing/measuring my food stresses me out. This works for a lot of people but not me.

Starting my day with a walk energizes me for the day and doing OT after work gives me an outlet for my stress. And start small. No need to make yourself start working out five days a week. Start with one walk in a day and you’ll be amazed at how much more you want to move your body.\n\n## Comment ID jltzvtc with +1 score by [(ozzleworth, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltzvtc/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI do things, get fed up or reach a good level, get bored and try something else!

A LOT. Usually an average of more than 10.000 steps.\n\nI have made it a habit of doing a few repetitions of an exercise whenever I am in my bathroom. I have a kettlebell in my bathroom that I lift a couple of times, or I might do a few squats, if you have a little more space you could also do a few pushups or sit-ups. I find it really adds up.\n\nThose are things that don't require a lot of motivation, I get movement in while I go about my day.\n\nI am practicing intuitive eating and what helped me is to improve my cooking skills. I know how to make well balanced meals. \n\nI also purchased a bullet blender. This was a great call for me because if I feel like I am not eating well or lacking variety, I just make a well balanced smoothie with some protein powder and frozen fruit and toss that in the mix.\n\nI want to stay healthy and feel good.\n\n## Comment ID jlu3p50 with +1 score by [(empath0619, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlu3p50/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nBefore chronic illness, I was doing really well with clean eating 5 days a week and one to two cheat MEALS a week.

The best approach is what you can do and what you can sustain over the long term. I do not recommend any fad diets at all. I also do not recommend anything that's super restrictive or requires you spend money on plans, specific food, supplements, etc. \n\nThe reason why it needs to be sustainable is because investing in your health and fitness now and making it a lifelong habitat will benefit you for your entire life, and you'll really see that happens when you're in your 50s. That's when your habits start to catch up to you and the impact of your lifestyle really makes itself felt.\n\nFor cred: I'm 43 and while I no longer run marathons or do triathlons, I still hike, mountain bike, do yoga and lift weights. I am not exactly rocking a six-pack but I'm healthy, energetic and capable of doing physical work. My husband has a similar lifestyle, and he's one of the very few 60-somethings I know who takes no medication and has had no health scares.

I am mostly fit. I pretty much think it was being really athletic as a kid, taking dance classes, (still occasionally do), horseback riding (I still do that every week), sports and being outside running around all of the time. Just all around staying physically active. I have goats and chickens, so I regularly jump over fences, haul hay and 50lb sacks of feed around. When I walk, I walk fast. I stretch to keep my joints limber.\n\nAs for diet, I eat whatever I feel like eating whenever I feel like it, but compared to my friends, I seem to eat a lot less than they do...... but then, I also weigh a lot less. Interestingly, they all think they eat way less than I see that they actually do eat. I eat full fat, and sugar. No caffeine, not much alcohol. I never eat food with the words, \"low fat\", \"fat free\", \"diet\" or \"keto\" on them. I do eat fresh food that I make from scratch, and almost nothing processed. Never have. Fast food? Pretty much never. Breakfast is a no. I eat one large meal a day and snack on fruit or whatever....I graze. Big meal always has veg and whatever else I feel like.\n\nI am around 8lbs heavier than I'd like to be, (right now I am 5'2\" and 112lbs on a very small frame), but I'm too lazy to diet. You lose muscle as you get older and gain a tummy pretty much no matter how fit you are, but you also get more complacent about how you look as long as you feel good and are mostly healthy.\n\n## Comment ID jlu9t5s with +1 score by [(ZedZemM, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlu9t5s/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI gained some weight that stick since I turned 30.

I spend a LOT of time in the kitchen \n\n2) Weight lifting. I've found this is the most helpful for me. I love packing on the muscle and getting gains. \n\n3) Keeping temptation food out of the house. I have no willpower.

I also was very into using the Magnolia Cookbooks and any random recipe I found on Pinterest. Have you ever looked up a recipe out of desperation because you have two ingredients? Yeah, the solution is always to add pasta and cream cheese. I found the \"Skinny Taste\" cookbooks and website and everything changed.

Slow build. Be patient. \n\nAlso I’ve seen two grandparents age: 1 was fit (fit means a lot to a lot of ppl, find fit for you) and the other was healthy enough but didn’t stay active or fit. As they got older, that fit foundation paid in gold. My other grandparent felt like they declined so rapidly out of nowhere. I want to age in a way that allows me to take care of myself and enjoy old age and that starts now.\n\n## Comment ID jlug0mx with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlug0mx/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI eat a carnivore diet\n\n## Comment ID jlug2yt with +1 score by [(marilern1987, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlug2yt/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI used to do a lot of road cycling.  I had to stop, unfortunately, as I had an underlying muscular-skeletal issue, and I could theoretically keep cycling but I haven’t yet worked out a way to do it without issues.  These days I do a lot of step-based workouts like incline walking and regular outdoor hikes.  I am a huge believer in walking - people do not walk nearly enough, in my opinion.\n\nBut as a regular form of cardio, cycling just ticks off every box for me:  it gets you outside, it’s a fun way to explore the world (even if it’s “just” your local town), it feels like being a kid, and it burns a ton of calories.  There is a big sense of accomplishment in finishing a ride.  I hope to find a way to do it again.\n\nI also strength train.  I had to stop training for some time.  But the good thing about strength, is that if you ever got really strong once, it becomes easier to get it back.\n\nIn my 20’s, it took me months to be able to pick up certain weights.  But about 2 years ago I had to stop, and once I got the okay from my doctor to train again, it took me weeks to build that strength back up.  “Muscle memory” is a real thing\n\nLately I’ve been working on my mobility, particularly my ankle mobility.  I also like to do back mobility exercises, and hip stretches\n\n## Comment ID jlugq0a with +1 score by [(SmolSpaces15, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlugq0a/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nFinding exercises I actually enjoy helps me stick to a workout 4-5/wk.

The other 20%, eat the “junk food” if you want, life is too short to not have the cookie. \nPrioritize protein in your meals. 30g per meal is a good amount to shoot for. \nPrioritize sleep. 7+ hours of night, consistently. \nFind a type of exercise you enjoy, and do it 3-4 times a week. Lifting weights is preferable, because building muscle mass is incredibly important as you age, but just keep moving! The human body WANTS to move.

Incorporate some sort of weight bearing exercises to maintain bone density and raise your BMR. You don’t need to obsessively track calories but when food shopping or planning your meals for the week, start by selecting your proteins and try to meet your daily goal. Next you should think of good sources of fats and finally I find that carbs are in anything and everything and are mostly unavoidable so I don’t plan for them. \n\nIf that’s a lot to think of try to shop the perimeter of the grocery store or try to eat things that you can “look at and tell what it is” e.g. chicken breast, vegetables, rice, whole grains.

When I hit menopause in my late forties, I kinda fell into a funk and stopped everything and it showed. What works for me now:\n\nDiet:  I eat one big meal a day, usually lunch, and it's much easier for me than trying to eat a lot of little meals.  I don't really count calories but I go heavy on protein and fat, light on carbs, and try to always include something green.  \n\nI try to let myself get actually hungry before I eat, not starving, just hungry instead of munchy.  I find if I'm never hungry, I'm gaining weight.  If I get a little hungry in the evening, I'll have something small like pistachios or a cheese stick.\n\nExercise:  It's easier if you can find something social you enjoy.  I'm on a competitive rowing team, we train together and go to regattas.  If I don't feel like working out, I still do because my crew is counting on me.\n\nI started doing yoga online a couple of years ago and it's been great.  I do at least 30 min every evening, it's a great way to relax for bed and has really firmed up my arms.\n\nAlcohol:  I quit drinking entirely and my weight has dropped to it's lowest in my adult life (I was never all that overweight but maybe a bit chubby).  I also feel great all the time.

I dunno. Being healthy? Let me tell you what I do! I'm in my early 50s and I think I'm in good shape, at least as good as I was in my 20s, even though I'm a bit heavier now (5' 4.5\", hovering around 145 pounds, whereas at age 30 I was about 10 pounds lighter). My weight has been pretty stable since having kids, but I do occasionally diet to knock a few pounds off (5-10, which I can do in a month or two, then go back to normal).\n\nI've always walked a few miles most days. For a while in my 20s and 30s I did martial arts, which I enjoyed and was good for me socially. I did lose some fitness when my kids were young because of disrupted sleep and the stress of living with young kids and a man-child. A couple of years ago I took up running and now I run about 20 miles/week, which is great for my mental health as well as whatever it does physically. \n\nI do prioritize sleep -- I go to bed early-ish and wake up pretty early, too. I'm starting to prioritize eating more protein, but I don't have a very restrictive diet. On days when I don't do a long run, I generally stick to 3 meals/day and no significant snacks. I also cook, so most of my diet comes from \"real\" ingredients, rather than packaged convenience foods... but my kids (and my ex) like them so I'm not a purist. I ran a trail half marathon this morning and I just ate half a pint of Ben & Jerrys because I wanted it. \n\nBut yeah, stay active, do things you enjoy, sleep enough, and eat well.\n\nAlso I've cut way back on alcohol and avoiding alcohol makes a huge difference, too.\n\n## Comment ID jluuujc with +1 score by [(PeachyKeenest, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jluuujc/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nEating right - I got a nutritionist after awhile and proteins are the way to go.

For example, I have a friend that lost a ton of weight by becoming a marathon runner, she's competitive, so her main motivation was to keep running so she could do better in races. That worked for her, while I, someone who isn't competitive but is more goal oriented, just set weekly fitness goals. Stuff like go to the gym at least 3 times this week. \n\nConsidering how I get a hit of dopamine by accomplishing weekly goals, and how my friend gets a hit of dopamine when her run is a little bit faster, the secret to finding a healthy lifestyle that works for you is figuring out what healthy activities and habits release dopamine in your brain. The reason this is important because dopamine also motivates us to take action, its not only the reward.\n\nSo if the investment in our health is something that genuinely makes us happy, it is easier to be motivated to maintain that investment. At first it will be hard, because your brain may be more motivated to do unhealthy things, and it will take some experimentation to find an activity or diet that you enjoy. However once you figure out what works for you and you start sticking to it consistently, maintaining a healthy lifestyle gets easier and easier.  \n\n\nI like to say eating healthy and working out isn't hard. What's hard is changing your lifestyle.\n\n## Comment ID jlv7qld with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlv7qld/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nWhat do you mean by 'looking healthy'?\n\n## Comment ID jlv84n3 with +1 score by [(StrawberryKiss2559, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlv84n3/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI did nothing different than my 20s.

I packed on weight, had blood sugar issues and skin tags on my neck that were indicating pre diabetes, and I was suffering from lots of reflux, aches pains and inflammation. It got to the point where some days the inflammation was so bad I could barely walk, and nearly everything I ate or drank would result in days of reflux/heartburn - so I had to make big change. At first I went to the doctor and they put me on anti inflammatory meds which helped with inflammation, but made the reflux worse and I started to develop a stomach ulcer. I got cranky about taking drugs that made things worse, went on a research frenzy, and decided to address it myself with diet and exercise. My whole body has changed in the last eight months. I started on a vegan diet, but not strictly, about 70-80% of the time. I find if it’s too strict I get annoyed and abandon it, so now my motto is being good most of the time. This helped reduce the inflammation. I would say I experienced about 80% reduction in pain and inflammation within days of going vegan. I stopped drinking alcohol too, and stuck to a vegan diet for about 3 months. It helped get me to the point where I could start thinking about exercise bc before that I was in so much pain it would not have been possible. After a while on vegan diet I noticed that I was overeating and the blood sugar issues were not improving. I was ravenous and always prowling in the kitchen, so I decided to go mostly keto as it’s as clear I was still on a blood sugar spike and drop cycle. I started drinking a Yerba mate supplement in the mornings to help manage blood sugar and suppress cravings and it made a huge difference. I now usually don’t eat breakfast, I have a Yerba mate and have my first keto meal at midday, and my dinner - also keto - at around 5pm. After being on keto 70-80% of the time for a month I was losing so much weight that I had to increase my calories bc I was getting stretch marks (I hadn’t had any since I was a teen and I forgot how much they hurt!). So if I am out of my house now I eat whatever I like and drink alcohol, but at home it’s keto only. Weight loss wasn’t the goal but since going mostly keto I’ve dropped close to 14kg. When I went keto I also started doing reformer Pilates twice a week, and I try to walk more. Pilates has made a world of difference, I feel so strong and I stand taller. I realised I don’t like pointless walking, so I make sure to book social events where I have enough time to walk into the city after work (about 40min - an hour once or twice a week). It feels like I can maintain this forever and continue to add new good habits to this baseline I’ve created. I’m still losing weight but much more slowly, and I don’t feel deprived. I wish I had started this younger. There’s so much advice and many opinions on what you should do - it’s confusing. I had to try a few things and see what worked for me bc we are all a little different. I have ADHD which means that unless I love something or it’s purposeful (exercise) I won’t stick with it, and ordering pre-cooked keto meals saves me time money and food waste. I would have loved to stay vegan morally, but I just couldn’t make it work for my body long term and I’m glad I listened to my body.\n\n## Comment ID jlvusmv with +1 score by [(MongooseInCharmeuse, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlvusmv/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nWeight lifting & rucking (walking increasing distances while increasing weight).

As I got older I got tired much quicker throughout the days and it's easy to get into the mindset of 'I'll do it tomorrow' in terms of healthy eating and exercise. But I've wavered enough times to remember the feeling of being sick and unwell from a bad diet and how much less pain I'm in when I eat well and exercise. So I always make sure my mindset is clear and put lots of willpower into looking after myself. If you don't feel like you have willpower, literally sternly tell yourself out loud 'you ARE going to do it, and you ARE going to feel great after' and just propel yourself along to whatever your fitness goals are. If you tell yourself you're too tired (or can't be bothered) you effectively talk yourself into not doing it when in reality you can. Even if you fail after 2 minutes, it's better to do that than never to have tried at all. This has kept me mentally at my happiest and at my physical peak. \n\n - Also calories in Vs calories out is vital for fitness goals, exercise can be as hard or light as you want depending on what your personal goals are.\n\n## Comment ID jlvz9r7 with +1 score by [(Mor_Tearach, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlvz9r7/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nHonestly?

I know people who flourish on intermittent fasting, keto and quite restrictive diets. I can not. I realised I’m a volume eater, so I do really well on a Mediterranean diet - unlimited whole grains, legumes, fruit, veg, some dairy, fish a couple of times a week, red meat once or twice a month, some chicken but a whole lot of vegetarian days.  I lost so much weight I had to reintroduce cake, though I tried to make ones with nutritional value (fruit, nuts, various grain flours), but real sugar and butter. \n\nMeal planning and meal prepping were essential for me to stick to it, I never had to cook very much during my work week, I was allowed to snack as much as I wanted, but it had to be substantial and nutritious, so if I was emotional eating I’d get full too quickly and stop. So I kept a variety of foods to meet these snacking requirements in the house. \n\nI also worked a non-sedentary job (nursing) and took the stairs. I wasn’t OTT with working out, but I did press ups and sit ups a couple of times a week, went swimming or trail walking once or twice a week and walked around the block if I felt like I needed some activity. \n\nThen I had kids, had a whole bunch of food aversions while pregnant, have much less time and have to cook family meals and kids go too slow to get a good brisk walk in.

They just moved me around to different departments where they needed help.\n  \nSince then at a different company, I’ve trained about 10 interns for more than 6 months each. Some went on to grad school, aerospace, biomedical, oem automotive. At first, all were useless from an engineering perspective but the key is that they were all **trainable** and had their university degree knowledge as a good base to start training from.\n\n### Comment ID egdxcf7 with +24 score by [(doggoistlife, Reddit, 2019-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/aq6p4t/im_a_lost_biomedical_engineering_undergrad/egdxcf7/) (in reply to ID egdx2jq):\nOh, that is some valuable info\n\n#### Comment ID ege4y9r with +13 score by [(Betterthanalemur, Reddit, 2019-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/aq6p4t/im_a_lost_biomedical_engineering_undergrad/ege4y9r/) (in reply to ID egdxcf7):\nCan't upvote this enough, internships are huge.\n\n## Comment ID egdsgzk with +28 score by [(XBL_Unfettered, Reddit, 2019-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/aq6p4t/im_a_lost_biomedical_engineering_undergrad/egdsgzk/) (in reply to ID aq6p4t):\nYou’re not wrong to be a bit concerned, if you aren’t planning grad school.  Unlike BSME/EE and some of the associated disciplines, BSBME is mostly a stepping stone to grad school, like a BS in a pure science.  There definitely ARE jobs out there for a BSBME, but most of the BSME’s I went to school with went on to engineering grad or med school.\n\nNow, as to the skills you actually have vs an EE or an ME, I have some good news: most of us don’t expect a new college grad to know anything about how to do the work of engineering.  You will have proven, by getting the BS, that you can learn to be an engineer.  You will be brought into a workplace and you’ll have to learn the job, no matter your BSE.  Even better: once you have a few years as a proven engineer, the undergrad isn’t going to matter that much.\n\n### Comment ID ege32me with +16 score by [(AineDez, Reddit, 2019-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/aq6p4t/im_a_lost_biomedical_engineering_undergrad/ege32me/) (in reply to ID egdsgzk):\nIt doesn’t have to be!

People are saying internships are crucial but I think as long as you're in an ABET accredited program you can get interviews. What I think is the most important is that you make sure you understand the subjects that are being taught to you like the back of your hand. If you're in an ABET accredited program the things you are learning will 100% apply in the real world. New grads are like investments. Just show them that you are worth investing in, work hard and really prove to yourself that you are worth investing in and you will get a job. I never had an internship and as a CS major and I still had a job right after graduation.

The fact that you are concerned is a good thing. It shows that you care and that you will likely take steps to get you to a better postion, regardless of what your position is now.\n2. \" Is it enough to study hard in college to be employable afterwards ?\" - In my opinion no, there is this bullshit ideology that doing well/ studying well in school leads to a successful career. School is supposed to give you skills for the real world... I found that only a handful of classes did. While HR might care about your GPA, the people who actually hire you will want to see actual job experience of some kind. The closer to your field the better, but having nothing is the worst.\n3. Emphasize the actual skills you picked up in your degree. Keep up the programming (as that is continuing to grow) and don't be afraid to look outside the box.\n4. Take risks and send it brotha.

I took QE role and learned a lot of the basics on the fly while having good work ethic with the high desire to learn. Eventually moved back closer to home (snow sucks) to a smaller contract manufacturing company with some development assistance and 10x the responsibilities.

Finding a BME job can be hard. Internships are crucial, but they're hard to get considering many don't want our major as much as mech, elec, or cs. \n\nI came to realize that BME is really what you make of it. Specialize in a subfield: biomechanics, imaging (most profitable imo), cellular mechanics, bioinstrumentation, biomaterials, etc. See if you can find work in those fields and see if you can somehow focus your coursework for a subfield. Then do internships. You'll find that it's easier that way. Startups are easier to get into than companies like J&J or Stryker, so start low and then build your way up to them. \n\nOr you can go into a field in which BME is actually more desired: health informatics and data science. It's a field that any major can go into, but your BME background can really set you apart in compared to other engineers. Besides, it often pays higher than entry level engineering jobs. Make sure you know how to code in one or two languages and understand how you can use data science techniques to solve health related problems or optimize health industry systems.\n\n### Comment ID ege4cy1 with +2 score by [(doggoistlife, Reddit, 2019-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/aq6p4t/im_a_lost_biomedical_engineering_undergrad/ege4cy1/) (in reply to ID ege479m):\nOh cool, now this is some specific info from a fellow undergrad i was looking for\n\n#### Comment ID ege4gp2 with +2 score by [(itanorchi, Reddit, 2019-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/aq6p4t/im_a_lost_biomedical_engineering_undergrad/ege4gp2/) (in reply to ID ege4cy1):\nI'm doing BME in grad now too and boy let me tell you how much easier it's been trying to get data science internships than engineering ones.\n\n## Comment ID egeadxr with +1 score by [(hipstergrandpa, Reddit, 2019-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/aq6p4t/im_a_lost_biomedical_engineering_undergrad/egeadxr/) (in reply to ID aq6p4t):\nAs someone else who's been there, internships are a 100% must!

The bodily recovery happens of course during the whole sleep, but i think deep sleep is more important for it. So for actual bodily recovery it might not be as shitty as alcohol. Alcohol is especially interesting (or it's effects obvious) in this regard because it takes a big hit at your HRV. Longterm cannabis won't have only good effects of course. So for someone who wants to optimize health, training etc. it's not a good option. \n\n@ OP unfortunately there won't be any shortcuts or easy ways. The best things are the simple ones.

In other words, the fitbit incentivized walking/running, and that's it. I felt like I was wasting a workout if I did anything else, so all I did was run or go for super long walks. \n\nOn the other hand, without a tracker (as I have been the last few months), I fell into another bad pattern: all my workouts were easy. As a solo person working out, I was too lazy to push my heart rate. I would either lift heavy weight or go on easy breezy jogs. I did get strong, but but developed zero endurance. \n\nThis is where the whoop comes in: Every morning the whoop will tell me if I'm ready for a huge cardiovascular strain. As others have said, powerlifting, walks, etc will barely register, if at all, as straining. This pushed me to try different hard workouts to push my heart. Through some experimenting, I have found the best way to push my heart rate as much as possible. When I do this, invariably when I wake up the next day my body is not ready for high strain. These are the days I lift weights or go on easy walks. So for me, the whoops forces me to better balance my workouts. It doesn't penalize you for not pushing hard on high strain days, but you do feel a sense of leaving something on the table. Nor does it penalize you for switching up workouts, it doesn't care as long as your hr is up. I switch between running, rowing, jump rope, heavy bag boxing, kettlebell swing and box jumps. \n\nSo for me personally, if my sole goal is to get my hr up and keep it up as long as possible, I know I can do a workout that incorporates rounds of double unders for 10-20 minutes, and then jump on the rower for another 40 and I'm spent. I can'd do this every day or else my feet hurt, so I switch to something like kettlebell swings. In this way I'm more balanced, don't burn out as easily. \n\nTl;dr: whoop does motivate by pushing me to train hard some days but not all days, gives me motivation to balance.\n\n## Comment ID ewo2rkk with +1 score by [(tessa0k, Reddit, 2019-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/cp9ndv/whoop_suitable_for_people_that_dont_overtrain_but/ewo2rkk/) (in reply to ID cp9ndv):\nThank you for your response.

      "# Post ID 129uavk: Mastery of the basics with +1094 score by [(biciklanto, Reddit, 2023-04-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HubermanLab/comments/129uavk/mastery_of_the_basics/)\n**TL:DR:** Rather than obsessing about protocols (minutes of sun or temperature of cold showers or type of magnesium), focus on the big things first. Exercise enough (both cardio and strength training); optimize sleep quality and quantity; eat a varied diet of high-quality and mostly unprocessed foods; and avoid addictive behaviors. In addition, focus on meaningful social relationships for both mental and physical health.\n\n# Missing the forest for the trees: Context\n\nI'm writing this post because I am seeing an inverse correlation between the increasing popularity of Huberman's podcast (and thus membership in this sub) with the quality of discussion and focus on the right things. It feels to me like a huge part of this sub is missing the forest for the trees, focusing on specific minutiae and protocols (the last 5%) rather than on the major steps one should take to improve their health, longevity, and quality of life.\n\n# The big picture: Do these things first\n\nHere are the things that you should do, and optimize, before worrying about which kind of magnesium or how many minutes of morning sun or whether blue-blocking glasses are killing your serotonin hit (they aren't). For each of these points, I'm including timestamps to episodes in which Huberdaddy or his guests mentioned things to keep in mind; I would be happy if folks gave me better sources below. \n\nAs always, I strongly recommend the [Huberman AI](https://huberman.rile.yt/) site (and thank its author) as an excellent resource for getting the right information.\n\n\n**1. Sleep**\n\nGet enough sleep, and do what you can to make your environment conducive to high-quality sleep (via temperature, light regulation, a healthy pre-sleep routine, etc).\n\n* How much sleep is enough? Huberman references 7-9 hours of \"really terrific\" sleep. [Master Your Sleep & Be More Alert When Awake @ 00:05:06](https://youtu.be/nm1TxQj9IsQ?t=306).\n* What temperature should your sleep environment be? Likely 3 degrees or more cooler than during the daytime. [Sleep Toolkit: Tools for Optimizing Sleep & Sleep-Wake Timing @ 01:05:45](https://youtu.be/h2aWYjSA1Jc?t=3945)\n* Room darkness: though a pitch-black room isn't necessary, one should focus on having a dark room to improve sleep quality and reduce \"wake hormones\" from disrupting sleep quality. Here's an anecdote about how Matthew Walker (a sleep expert) keeps his house \"cave-like\" during his sleep period. [Sleep Toolkit: Tools for Optimizing Sleep & Sleep-Wake Timing @ 01:03:12](https://youtu.be/h2aWYjSA1Jc?t=3792)\n* Have a \"wind-down routine\" to help you fall asleep at night (e.g., meditation, reading, NOT television). [Dr. Matthew Walker: The Science & Practice of Perfecting Your Sleep @ 02:51:41](https://youtu.be/gbQFSMayJxk?t=10301)\n\n**2. Exercise**\n\nExercise frequently, ideally mostly at a low intensity that allows for either nose breathing or talking, with some bouts every week at a very high intensity.\n\n* How often should we exercise? We should aim for at least five days per week to optimize brain health, cardiovascular health, as well as the health of other systems of the body. [Maximizing Productivity, Physical & Mental Health with Daily Tools @ 00:55:20](https://youtu.be/aXvDEmo6uS4?t=3320)\n* How much cardiovascular exercise should we get? Huberdaddy mentions both 150-180 minutes[^1](https://youtu.be/Xu1FMCxoEFc?t=4135) minimum per week, and that at least 180-200 minutes per week help increase longevity. [Understand & Improve Memory Using Science-Based Tools @ 01:25:20](https://youtu.be/szqPAPKE5tQ?t=5120)\n* What should our cardiovascular fitness goal be? Peter Attia indicates that having \"elite\" cardiovascular fitness causes a 5-fold reduction in all-cause mortality compared to cohort peers [ Dr. Peter Attia: Exercise, Nutrition, Hormones for Vitality & Longevity @ 00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCmprPCDqc&t=2311s)\n* Why should we do both cardio and strength training? Because it improves both cardiovascular health (necessary for longevity) and overall health. Jeff Cavaliere advocates a 60:40 strength:cardio ratio for an effective minimum dose per week. [Jeff Cavaliere: Optimize Your Exercise Program with Science-Based Tools @ 00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNCwdFxPtE8&t=518s)\n\n**3. Eating well**\n\nEat varied, high-quality, mostly unprocessed foods, on a reasonable schedule.\n\n* What is healthy eating? It involves eating good foods in an appropriate amount, at reasonable times, and there are a variety of possible diets that can support health, including omnivore and vegan/vegetarian diets. [Healthy Eating & Eating Disorders - Anorexia, Bulimia, Binging @ 02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XGREPnlI8U&t=7545s)\n* Why should we avoid heavily processed foods? \"Eating whole foods has tremendous value and eating highly processed food has tremendous negative impact on the gut and on the gut brain axis.\" [How Our Hormones Control Our Hunger, Eating & Satiety @ 00:48:11](https://youtu.be/17O5mgXZ9ZU?t=2891)\n* Note: there are other episodes in which eating at waking and then stopping a few hours before bedtime are discussed[^source](https://youtu.be/JPX8g8ibKFc?t=5539), as well as intermittent fasting and restricted feeding schedules[^source](https://youtu.be/9tRohh0gErM?t=4334), but here I have less expertise and would appreciate advice or timestamped links.\n\n**4. Avoiding addictive behaviors**\n\nAvoid addictive behaviors, and promote brain health through the above steps and via time outdoors, time meditating, and so on.\n\n* Some examples of addictive behaviors? \"When I use the word drug, I'm talking about substances and behaviors really. And I'm talking about behaviors like gambling, sex, gaming, porn, absolutely, shopping, work.\" [Dr. Anna Lembke: Understanding & Treating Addiction @ 00:32:24](https://youtu.be/p3JLaF_4Tz8?t=1944)\n* Social media as an addictive behavior? \"So the first message I would want to get across about social media is that it really is a drug and it's engineered to be a drug.\" [Dr. Anna Lembke: Understanding & Treating Addiction @ 01:41:40](https://youtu.be/p3JLaF_4Tz8?t=6100)\n* Why porn can cause issues? \"But again, any activity that evokes a lot of dopamine release will make it harder to achieve the same level and certainly the greater level of dopamine through a subsequent interaction. So yes, indeed, many people are addicted to pornography and yes, indeed, many people who regularly indulge in pornography experience challenges in real world romantic interactions.\" [Controlling Your Dopamine For Motivation, Focus & Satisfaction @ 01:56:22](https://youtu.be/QmOF0crdyRU?t=6982)\n* Why is controlling dopaminergenic activities (especially low-effort, addictive behaviors that cause releases of dopamine) important? Because it reduces our dopamine baseline and makes getting pleasure out of everyday activities more difficult. [Controlling Your Dopamine For Motivation, Focus & Satisfaction @ 01:04:19](https://youtu.be/QmOF0crdyRU?t=3859)\n\n# A wrap-up: why I think this post is necessary for this subreddit\n\nThere is a lot to think about in terms of health, and Huberman goes into a lot of detail about things we can do to improve our lives. So why is it that so many posts in this subreddit don't address that these behaviors are the basics, the foundation, the first step, the cornerstone of health, both physical and mental?\n\nI think it's because none of it is new or exciting. What's more, none of it is as /easy/ as arguing about stupid minutiae about the right supplement stack (easy to take, low effort), or exactly the right zone, or exactly how to get morning sunlight. All those things are lower-effort, and from a high-level perspective, it looks suspiciously like users here just trading out their low-effort dopamine hits from gaming or drinking a red bull for low-effort dopamine hits via popping pills or arguing.\n\nSo my appeal to those of you who read this and participate in this sub is this: **ground your discussions, your comments, and your contributions in this subreddit to the most important things we can do for our health.** If someone is asking about some nuanced, minor point, it's worth answering — but perhaps remind them that the big-picture items need to be in order first. \n\nExercise, particularly cardiovascular health, is one of the biggest tools we have for health and longevity. Sleep is vital for mental and physical performance, and ties into our ability to perform everything from everyday tasks all the way up to learning the most complex things we will ever approach. Eating well underpins our ability to sleep well, to exercise, to understand and process things in the world around us, and as those nutrients literally make up our physical composition, have a long-term impact on how we live and when we will die. And finally, we find ourselves in a world of abundance, in which a variety of things are now available as addictive behaviors in a different way than was ever the case before: phones, Reddit, games, television & movies — so many things provide a \"bottomless bowl\" of dopamine that will reduce our satisfaction and ability to perform in our day-to-day lives. \n\nFocus on each of these factors, ground discussions in each of these factors, and both our lives and the health of this subreddit will increase.\n\n**What's missing?** Now, this list may well not be exhaustive, and there may be other cornerstone behaviors and practices that are directly relevant. Please let me know what they are, and I will include them here.\n\nI hope this is helpful, and is at least food for thought. I fear that, because it's a higher effort post than some shitpost about sunrise or memeing Huberdaddy, that it's going to go unnoticed. If that's the case, I suppose that's an indication about how folks here really are missing the forest for the trees. I hope not.\n\n# Addendum: Community Contributions\n\n**Social Relationships**\n\nAs /u/The_GrimTrigger pointed out, another component to keep in mind is social relationships, and Huberman has spoken about those as well. A few points that come to mind for me, though I'm happy if others have other data points from Huberman podcasts they would like to share:\n\n* Why do social connections matter? Aside from the satisfaction of it, the data points to social connection —certain types in particular— help reduce long-term stress. ([Tools for Managing Stress & Anxiety @ 01:06:47](https://youtu.be/ntfcfJ28eiU?t=4007))\n* What are dangers of not having adequate social connection? Isolation often leads to elevated stress hormones and there is data pointing to it having a long-term negative impact on systems like the immune system. ([Science of Social Bonding in Family, Friendship & Romantic Love @ 00:11:10](https://youtu.be/RgAcOqVRfYA?t=670))\n* Final note: I recall that Huberman spoke at some point about how social interactions are almost more important these days, what with all the \"proxies\" for social engagement we have. If someone finds the timestamp, that would be very helpful.\n\n## Comment ID jepfvmw with +128 score by [(The_GrimTrigger, Reddit, 2023-04-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HubermanLab/comments/129uavk/mastery_of_the_basics/jepfvmw/) (in reply to ID 129uavk):\nOutstanding, timely post.

Rather, he is a scientist looking for health signals & outcomes tied to a variety of behavior. This messaging is positively biased towards action when there are positive outcomes that have been observed, and that's what's going on here:\n\nDr. Huberman and others have observed (or identified studies observing) positive health outcomes for social behavior, and that's being referenced. There being \"better\" reasons to pursue relationships —which, again, I'm absolutely in favor of— is outside the purview of someone who is effectively a highly qualified reviewer of studies and evidence available.\n\n#### Comment ID jmsdz33 with +3 score by [(Idysseus, Reddit, 2023-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HubermanLab/comments/129uavk/mastery_of_the_basics/jmsdz33/) (in reply to ID jeuqyk1):\nIsn't this a \"both/and\" situation?

I'm happy to be wrong; however, I don't get that impression in perhaps most of the posts I come across.

Luck makes the critical meter fill faster, but improved basic DPS is better, in my opinion.\n\n## Comment ID lm61a8s with +6 score by [(Valarrian, Reddit, 2024-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/foshelter/comments/1fc3idi/whats_the_best_outfit/lm61a8s/) (in reply to ID 1fc3idi):\nScarred power armor for defending, +7 special for resource rooms, moldaver's armor for waste land explorers\n\n## Comment ID lm73lfq with +3 score by [(GeorgiaOregonTexas, Reddit, 2024-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/foshelter/comments/1fc3idi/whats_the_best_outfit/lm73lfq/) (in reply to ID 1fc3idi):\nAgility 7 is best for quests because of attack speed\n\n## Comment ID lmajpsr with +3 score by [(Miltroit, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/foshelter/comments/1fc3idi/whats_the_best_outfit/lmajpsr/) (in reply to ID 1fc3idi):\nSee the pinned FAQ and linked posts from it.\n\nQuests: [https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-20:-Quests](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-20:-Quests)\n\nIf not level 50, on quests, send at least one dweller with an outfit with added E they can share if they need to level up, because health. If level 50 or the other dwellers on a quest, then added Agility is most helpful, followed by Luck, then Perception. So either Agility jumpsuits, Luck outfits, or outfits with a blend of PAL are most useful.

They'll use fewer stimpacks if you optimize health. If level 50, then an outfit with at least +1E so they are radiation immune with E total at 11 (assuming you trained to 10 in E as soon as possible). If you can only equip rare outfits, then Robot armor or swimsuit are good for the added E and L. If you can make legendary outifts, Moldaver's armor or similar for added E and L to find legendary junk.

      "# [On offense: Proactively personalizing medicine to optimize health](https://pharmacy.osu.edu/news/offense-proactively-personalizing-medicine-optimize-health)\nLaura Lile, MD, RPh, BS Pharm ’87, a dual-credentialed physician and clinical pharmacist, is nationally sought after for her proactive approach to preventative health and wellness – primarily using genomics.\n\n“I started down this path for my own family because we have extremely high cardiovascular and stroke risk,” Dr. Lile said. “I wanted to see my mom and dad be able to live a longer life, rather than losing them at 70 years old, which was common in my family history.”\n\nDr. Lile’s career has always been in the details.\n\nAfter her mom had a heart attack at a young age, Dr. Lile began looking into epigenetics to understand what she could do to improve her mom’s health. However, she wanted to go further – asking ‘what is the root cause of the disease or condition that patients are experiencing?’\n\nNow, through her practice, Lile Wellness Partners, Dr. Lile partners with patients to provide precise and comprehensive insights into their genetic makeup through IntellxxDNA™ testing. In addition, she uses bloodwork as the primary basis for following trend analysis of patients – both healthy and unhealthy. The Lile Wellness team can then tinker with medicine and supplement regimens to attain optimal health for their patients’ individual needs.\n\n“We practice offense medicine, not defense,” Dr. Lile said. “We believe in getting to the root cause of a disease state or condition. Rather than treating the condition only, we look at what may be causing it, such as lifestyle or genetic predispositions, to optimize a patient’s health.”\n\nGenomic testing allows patients to understand their genome and then dial in to very specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to see their risk factors for certain conditions and disease states. Pharmacists and physicians can then use that information to understand how to work around those SNPs. Using the gene variants, the health care team can modify risk using targeted medicine and supplements and then monitor the patient’s response through bloodwork.\n\n“We use these reports to analyze genes that are present in very low percentages in the population, less than 5% to 10%. We question why these genes still exist in someone's gene pool while the rest of the world has evolved and gotten rid of them” Dr. Lile said. “We then take a deep dive into the research to see what those genes have a higher risk of causing. In isolation, these gene variants are helpful to know, but without the IntellxxDNA™ tool and the evidence-based recommendations that it provides, it can be scary to know you carry a high-risk gene. These clinical decision tools remove that fear because now we can decipher how to override that part of your genome.”\n\nDr. Lile says that PharmDs are the perfect health care practitioners to perform the complex work of interpreting a genomic test, due to their expertise in the usage of medicine and accessibility to patients.\n\n“To use this tool effectively, you don’t need to prescribe medicine. You are guiding patients with a clinical tool to understand their genome and the why behind disease states like diabetes or depression. You can provide them with a powerful tool that can be refreshed on a routine basis, putting the pharmacist in an excellent position to be the patient’s health care advocate. Genomic tools can expand the role of the pharmacist.”\n\nHer strong belief that pharmacists can play a vital role in this process led Dr. Lile to invite four Ohio State PharmD students to an IntellxxDNA™ conference in the summer of 2023. She felt that it was her pharmacy training – not her medical training – that enabled her to understand the extremely complex reports she receives through genetic testing.\n\nOne of the students who attended the conference, Class of 2024 PharmD candidate, Kate Pollock, has continued her work with Dr. Lile and will join the Lile Wellness team upon her graduation in May 2024 as the first full-time PharmD in the clinical practice who will see patients and complete consults, rather than filling prescriptions.\n\nEven before tools like IntellxxDNA™, Dr. Lile had been using patients’ bloodwork markers to narrow in on improving health outcomes. However, the IntellxxDNA™ report, provides an immediate roadmap to optimal health outcomes without having to guess what’s going on with only some of the information.\n\n“I’ve spent years tweaking medications and supplements in patients to ensure that I see the responses in their blood work that I expect to see. While I’ve been doing this for years, I now have a clinical decision support tool that can get patients to optimal medication support on day one because we know exactly what their body needs.”\n\nDr. Lile and Pollock both attest to the benefits that their patients are seeing through this DNA-targeted precision-based medicine approach.\n\n“It has been great to meet with patients at their follow-up visits and hear how they’ve been able to participate in things like hiking or exercise that they weren’t able to before the testing,” Pollock said. “Patients are seeing progress on their health goals faster because we are able to tailor their body’s unique needs to them.”\n\nThey both also say the key to this type of intervention being used more widely is for pharmacists to continue to advocate for the profession.\n\n“The power of this tool can exponentially expand the role of pharmacists,” Dr. Lile said. “Pharmacists understand this complex medication and supplement-related data and use it to advocate for, and partner with, our patients. We need to identify the skill sets and value that we have as pharmacists to be a part of the solution. We’ve been doing it for years – pharmacists have always been the trusted healthcare professional, especially in rural communities that routinely experience a shortage of doctors. This is a natural progression for the profession of pharmacy.”",
      "# [Sait Tunc receives NSF CAREER award to optimize health care systems for equitable outcomes on 2024-04-05](https://news.vt.edu/articles/2024/04/tunc-career-award.html)\nIn an effort to revolutionize the health care system through operations research and systems engineering, Sait Tunc, an assistant professor in the Grado Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, has received a National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award.\n\nThe CAREER program supports early career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education and lead advances in the missions of their department or organization. This five-year grant totaling $568,619 will support Tunc’s research on inefficiencies in health care systems, particularly with respect to organ transplants. And it couldn’t be more timely.\n\nTunc’s research regarding organ utilization comes at a pivotal time in the industry. While organ scarcity exists, there is also a significant level of underutilization. Roughly 25 percent of organs recovered from deceased donors go unused for a variety of reasons. Patients may refuse organ offers because they come from a relatively higher risk donor, or they may choose to wait to see if another “better” organ becomes available. Additionally, patients with access to higher quality health care may receive special priority.\n\n“I want to identify disadvantaged patients and improve their access to organs. Federal law prevents penalizing patients for rejecting organ offers, which creates a gap between what is optimal for the individuals and how they behave. One mechanism I developed identifies disadvantaged patient groups who have reduced access to organs, thus a higher mortality rate,” Tunc said.\n\nIn addition to matching organs to recipients more efficiently, Tunc also wants to ensure equitable access for all in need. Perhaps surprisingly, this means taking into consideration voluntary incentive mechanisms, which prioritize motivating patients based on data rather than removing the option of choice. For example, instead of mandating participation, such as forcing a patient to accept an organ of relatively lower quality, voluntary incentive mechanisms give patients agency by showing them why they could reject an organ, but why they’d be better off accepting it rather than, say, remaining on dialysis.\n\n“We use data modeling to prioritize these patients for organ offers that are most beneficial to them. This improves the match between donors and recipients and addresses the issue of organ underutilization,” Tunc said. “The challenge in organ procurement is not just about finding more donors, but ensuring that the organs are used efficiently and equitably. I want to bridge the gap between what is best for society and how individuals behave.”\n\nIncentivizing healthy behavior\n\nVoluntary incentive mechanisms work at large-scale and individual levels, and Tunc’s research addresses both. He investigates how these strategies lead to an increase in wellness-related behaviors, such as exercise or tobacco cessation. This aspect of his proposal aims to encourage healthier behaviors considering that not everyone has the same level of delay discounting and using someone’s willingness to adopt healthier activities based on what reward they would receive if they change their habits.\n\n“My primary goal with this research is to design and implement voluntary incentive mechanisms in the health care field, for both organizations and individuals,” Tunc said. “Rather than use coercion or mandated participation, voluntary incentive mechanisms encourage participants through rewards. These tend to make implementing new strategies easier compared to traditional approaches in health care and improve outcomes at the individual, organizational, and societal levels.”\n\nUsing voluntary incentive mechanisms, Tunc’s research seeks to\n\nAlleviate the burden of organ scarcity, reduce the size of the transplant waiting list, improve the access of marginalized groups to transplants, and mitigate waitlist deaths\n\nPartner with Organ Procurement Organizations to expand organ availability and overall procurement\n\nReduce disparities in transplant access, especially for those at a significant disadvantage, including older patients and patients of color\n\nAlign individual actions with societal health goals, promote healthy behaviors, and improve long-term health outcomes especially among those most in need, such as individuals living with addiction or obesity\n\nAs part of the National Science Foundation’s support for educational outreach, the impacts of Tunc’s award will span from undergraduate engineering students to medical professionals, including a partnership with Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Virginia State University (VSU).\n\nHealth care providers can adjust their response to patients based on their willingness to adopt healthier behaviors. Tunc is hopeful this strategy will encourage people to adopt healthier habits while feeling they have choices in their decision making.\n\n“It’s crucial to design programs that actually motivate people to adopt healthier behaviors by considering all these individual differences in delay discounting, which explains why some people might not find long-term rewards as enticing. People that show addictive behavior, for example, are typically associated with higher delay discounting,” Tunc said. “This will enable researchers to find strategies that work for different groups.”\n\nThe future of health care systems\n\nTunc plans to use this research as an opportunity to educate others on how operations research and systems engineering and the use of voluntary incentive mechanisms can be beneficial for those working in the health care field, including short courses for medical students on implementing voluntary incentive mechanisms, and research education that will benefit undergraduate and graduate students at Virginia Tech and beyond.\n\n\"Our partnership with VSU is quite detailed, providing summer undergraduate research assistantship opportunities for VSU students at Virginia Tech, and offering an in-person opportunity for them to engage with groups in our department and elsewhere at the university,” Tunc said. “We hope we can engage students from multiple backgrounds and disciplines to participate, and encourage them to consider health care-related studies.”\n\nTunc’s grant-related research has informed his curriculum, including two new graduate level courses addressing health systems. Looking even further, Tunc hopes the research will impact policymakers from the top down while solving this complex global challenge.\n\n\"Beyond the direct educational interventions, the outreach activities associated with this research aim for policy change at the national level,” Tunc said. “Engaging with key stakeholders and policymakers ensures that the outcomes of this research are understood and potentially integrated into the national health care system.”",
      "# [AHRQ Strategic Plan for Health System Transformation To Optimize Health, Functional Status, and Well-Being Among Older Adults](https://www.ahrq.gov/priority-populations/publications/aging-well.html)\nThe U.S. population is rapidly aging, and the health system is ill-prepared to meet the needs of older adults. Older adults and individuals with multiple chronic conditions frequently receive fragmented and sub-optimal care, leading to poor outcomes, including avoidable adverse events, hospitalizations, and institutionalization, as well as increased costs negatively impacting the sustainability of Medicare and state Medicaid programs.\n\nBy re-engineering healthcare delivery systems so that care transformation optimizes health outcomes, functional status, and well-being, much of the morbidity and premature mortality associated with aging can be delayed or slowed, and chronic conditions can be effectively managed, allowing people to live independently and contribute to their communities longer.\n\nThis Strategic Plan details five goals and related strategies to achieve these goals for health system transformation that optimizes the health, functional status, and well-being among older adults.",

      "# [Optimize Health](https://optimize.health/blogs/?blog-page=1&category=decreased-workload)\nCCM Physician Type/Specialty RPM\n\nHow ACOs Can Leverage Chronic Disease Management Software\n\nFebruary is more than just a month of valentines—it’s a month dedicated to raising awareness about heart health in the United States. American Heart Month officially began in 1964 when President Lyndon B. Johnson issued a proclamation that brought awareness to heart disease, but the history of heart health dates back much further. From Fear of Heart Disease to Hope In 1921, heart disease became America’s leading cause of death and was typically viewed as a certain prognosis of death. However, six determined doctors refused this fate and founded the American Heart Association (AHA) in 1924. They were determined to find ways to understand, treat, and prevent heart disease through research and collaboration. In the late 1940s, raising awareness became a major priority for the AHA. While the AHA had some success, President Dwight Eisenhower’s heart attack in 1955 brought unprecedented national attention to cardiovascular health. At the time the concept of “risk factors” didn’t exist. Heart attacks “came out of nowhere” and the estimated death rate was 40%. His care, by today’s standards, was slow and ineffective. President Eisenhower instructed his press secretary and physician, Dr. Paul White to “tell them everything.” White capitalized on the opportunity to share with the American public steps they could take to reduce their risk and how heart attacks could be related to diet, exercise, alcohol, and tobacco. It was a major step towards overcoming the fear that a heart attack was a death sentence. With strong advocacy from the AHA, President Lyndon B. Johnson officially proclaimed February as American Heart Month on February 16, 1964. This wasn’t merely a symbolic gesture but a strategic initiative to combat what had become a national health emergency. With Awareness Comes Research and Innovation Since 1950, death rates from cardiovascular disease began to decline. Major innovations included: The first successful coronary bypass surgery in 1967 Development of cholesterol-lowering statins in the 1970s Introduction of advanced diagnostic and imaging techniques including electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms, cardiac computed tomography (CT), and blood tests in the 1980s A National Movement for Public Health Heart disease remains a critical health challenge with over 950,000 Americans dying from cardiovascular disease. Heart disease is still the #1 cause of death for men and women. Awareness of symptoms is critical as every one-minute delay in defibrillation can reduce the chance of survival by 10%. The AHA continues to be a driving force behind the month’s initiatives, developing educational programs, funding research, and creating public awareness campaigns that reach millions of Americans each year. The first Friday of each February is National Wear Red Day which raises awareness and support for heart disease. The goals of American Heart Month include: Helping the public understand heart health risk factors, including smoking and stress Driving awareness for heart-healthy lifestyle choices Raising funds for cardiovascular research Supporting preventative health strategies and early detection methods Modern Advances for Proactive Heart Health Today, American Heart Month continues to evolve. With rising obesity rates, sedentary lifestyles, and increased stress levels, the mission remains as crucial as ever. New drugs such as GLP-1s show promise for reducing heart attack and stroke in addition to helping patients lose weight and control their blood sugar levels. New care programs, including remote patient monitoring and chronic care management, can transform heart care from reactive to proactive. Embracing Heart Health Beyond medical achievements, American Heart Month has fundamentally changed how Americans perceive heart health. While heart disease was once considered an inevitable consequence of aging, we now know it is a preventable and manageable condition. Each February, we are reminded that heart health is not a passive experience but an active, ongoing commitment to living healthy. Optimize wants to support all practices and patients who want to take a proactive approach to heart health. Contact us to learn more about how RPM supports heart health.",

      "# [How To Optimize Health Plan Member Outcomes — Drips Conversations as a Service](https://www.drips.com/resources/how-to-optimize-health-plan-member-outcomes)\nToday’s onslaught of unwanted calls and emails has made it incredibly difficult for health insurance providers to connect with members who have a lot of unmet medical needs. To change this behavior in high-risk populations, healthcare professionals must now consider better ways to communicate with their members because simply contacting people isn’t good enough anymore.\n\nThe desire for payors to improve health outcome performance has never been more urgent. What’s prompting this change and why is the quality of engagement the answer? Let’s take a look\n\nWhat’s Driving The Need For Engagement?\n\nOne of the biggest drivers for member engagement (which also has major financial implications for insurers) is the change the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) made to the Medicare Advantage Star Rating scores this year. This change doubled the original 2X Medicare Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) measurement to 4X, meaning that 32% of the star rating will now be based on patient experience (PSQH), making it more important than ever for members to take full advantage of their benefits.\n\nAs you probably know, a higher star rating comes with some pretty great benefits. Plans rated three-and-a-half stars or less are paid a base rate based on the county in which it enrolls beneficiaries. However, if the plan increases the rating to four stars or more, it is paid a 5% bonus in addition to the base rate.\n\nThe most significant incentive is reserved for healthcare plans with a five-star rating, which can enroll members throughout the year, not just during the fall annual election period. And on top of that, plans receiving a bonus payment also get a better rebate level.\n\nBecause of the financial benefits, the need to improve a patient’s experience is too high to ignore. And what’s the best way to do that? Driving high-quality engagement.\n\nImproving The Member Experience & Driving Outcomes\n\nIf you want to drive member engagement and optimize outcomes within value-based healthcare models, you’ll need to improve the quality of care for members identified as “complex,” or within a high-risk population group. Generally, that’s achieved by focusing on three areas:\n\nEarly intervention for preventing a decline in quality of life and cost to fight disease.\n\nBehavioral health to implement lifestyle changes designed to halt disease progression.\n\nEducating members on best practices regarding annual wellness visits, preventive care, and health plan benefit utilization (RISE).\n\nMost healthcare insurance providers rely on call centers to communicate with their members, but there's a massive challenge with the most popular outreach strategy — people don’t pick up the phone if they don’t know the number (or if they’re busy). So, if health insurers want to achieve a high star rating, they’ll need to reinvent how they engage with their members.\n\nAdding an AI-powered conversational outreach platform will drive more personalized conversations and increase high-intent inbound call traffic. Rather than relying on one-way outreach methods, a conversational outreach approach encourages engagement on multiple fronts. It also puts the power in the audience’s hands while still being persistent.\n\nBenefits Of A Conversational Outbound Approach\n\nDrips Conversations as a Service combines AI-powered two-way texting, proactive calls, and voicemail messages designed to improve patient engagement. This allows you to put the member in charge of the conversation, enabling them to connect with you on their terms. The result?\n\nIncreased number of inbound engagements\n\nPrepared members expecting scheduled calls\n\nImproved quality of interaction\n\nMore members taking control of their health\n\nSimply put — you can’t improve a member’s health outcome without productive member engagement. And to do that, you need a modern outreach approach that leverages AI technology.\n\nWant to work towards improving or maintaining your star rating?",
