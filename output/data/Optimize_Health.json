      "# [Optimize Health](https://optimize.health/blogs/)\nCCM Physician Type/Specialty RPM\n\nHow ACOs Can Leverage Chronic Disease Management Software\n\nIntroduction Chronic Care Management (CCM) is increasingly vital in today’s healthcare landscape. As chronic conditions continue to rise, physicians face mounting challenges in delivering consistent, high-quality care while managing the administrative burdens of CCM. In this blog, we explore why many experts advocate for partnering with a managed clinical services provider rather than trying to build and maintain a self-managed CCM program—and why choosing the right partner matters. 1. Customization That Fits Your Practice WorkflowAlignment with Existing Processes: Managed CCM solutions are designed to integrate seamlessly with your practice’s existing workflows and electronic health records (EHR). Instead of forcing you to adapt to a rigid system, the right partner adapts to your unique style of care. Tailored Documentation and Care Plans: Effective CCM partners provide care plans that are both modular and customizable. The core clinical protocols remain consistent while the documentation and patient interactions are tailored to your practice’s specific needs. 2. Seamless Integration of Clinical SupportBeyond Software—Real Clinical Integration: A top-tier managed service brings in a dedicated clinical team trained on your systems and care protocols. This support means you won’t have to invest extra time in training staff or adjusting workflows—your partner becomes an extension of your team.Pre-Implementation Collaboration: Before launching the program, leading managed CCM providers work closely with your practice to understand your operations, assess your EHR environment, and develop tailored training materials and workflows. This collaborative approach ensures a smooth transition and consistent care delivery. 3. Scalability and EfficiencyResource Optimization: Building a CCM program from scratch requires substantial time, resources, and ongoing management. By partnering with experts, you can leverage pre-built, scalable solutions that have been honed through years of practical experience. Focus on Patient Care: With your clinical partner handling the dense documentation, nurse training, patient outreach, and workflow customization, you’re free to focus on what truly matters: delivering quality patient care. 4. The Value of Expert GuidanceLearning from Industry Best Practices: Successful managed CCM programs incorporate detailed implementation guides and custom training videos developed from years of real-world experience. These resources provide valuable insights into navigating complex care coordination challenges.Dynamic and Adaptive Systems: Modern CCM platforms are evolving to include features such as conditional logic that tailors care plans to patient-specific needs. This adaptability is crucial for reducing administrative burdens while maintaining patient-centered care.5. Not All Managed CCM Partners Are Created EqualThe Pitfalls of a “One-Size-Fits-All” Approach: While many managed CCM partners promise streamlined solutions, not all are flexible enough to truly integrate with your existing practice. Some may offer a cookie-cutter system that forces you to change your established workflows rather than enhancing them.Choosing the “Right” Partner: The key is to select a partner who is willing to bend their clinical services and documentation to match the way you care for your patients. As the saying goes, “You wouldn’t settle for an off-the-shelf suit when you can have a custom-tailored one.” The same applies to CCM—choose a partner that understands your needs and can deliver a solution that fits like a glove. (Hint: Some managed CCM partners claim to be as flexible as a gymnast—but you know which ones really deliver the flexibility you need.)6. Addressing the Challenges of Self-Managed CCMComplexity of Implementation: Many physicians trying to manage CCM on their own encounter challenges such as inefficient documentation, inconsistent training, and integration issues with their EHR. These challenges can lead to increased workload and diminished care quality.The Case for Partnership: Data and real-world experiences suggest that practices transitioning from self-managed to managed CCM see improvements in operational efficiency and patient outcomes. By outsourcing the complexities of CCM, you can free up valuable time and resources for what matters most—patient care.ConclusionFor physicians navigating the complexities of CCM, a managed clinical services partner offers a flexible, integrated solution that aligns with your existing workflows. By leveraging expert guidance, scalable systems, and tailored support, practices can focus on delivering high-quality care without being bogged down by administrative overhead. However, not all partners are created equal—choosing the right one, the partner that truly adapts to your practice rather than forcing you to conform, is critical for success. As the healthcare landscape evolves, staying informed about these strategies can help providers make better decisions for themselves and their patients. Remember, when it comes to managed CCM, it’s not just about having a partner—it’s about having the right partner.

The data also becomes part of the patient’s electronic health record. Those readings can initiate alerts if they are outside of the thresholds that you set for patients. The data exchange occurs continuously.\n\nThe software automatically tracks the number of patient readings and the engagement time. Adding manual time spent on evaluations and consultations is also available. With sorting filters, you can view readings and engagement minutes by patient to determine who is on track to meet monthly billing requirements. The system also tracks whether the patient has completed the synchronous call requirement to bill. You can export all data identifying eligible patients from the billing tab to your billing system.\n\nOur software and all supporting services, including insurance eligibility verification, are HIPAA compliant. Our software uses the agile methodology, so we can quickly integrate the latest CMS guidelines into the platform. This ensures you are always compliant and have a complete audit trail if needed.",
      "# [Remote Patient Monitoring Devices on 2023-11-02](https://optimize.health/connected-devices/)\nAll devices we provide are FDA-approved. The agency has many protocols to ensure they are safe to use. Additionally, manufacturers must have provisions in place for data security to mitigate the risk that’s inherent with internet-connected devices. The security guidelines also adhere to HIPAA compliance mandates.\n\nOnce devices are on your network, data encryption, cybersecurity best practices, compliance, and privacy regulations remain a priority.\n\nCellular connectivity and Bluetooth are the most common ways to connect devices online. If using a cellular network, there’s no need for a smartphone, which is a Bluetooth requirement.\n\nConnecting via Bluetooth can also be cumbersome for patients because they need to “pair” the device and their phone. Reliable and uninterrupted internet access is a requirement for Bluetooth, while cellular has broader coverage and is the easiest to set up. The device is ready right out of the box.\n\nOnce you implement our RPM software, you will work with our implementation experts to order the relevant FDA-compliant connected devices. We can deliver them directly to patient homes. After training and implementation, data begins to transmit from the devices to your RPM platform. Your program for remote care is ready, with accurate and reliable data at your fingertips.",

      "# [The Genesis of the Remote Care Platform](https://blog.optimize.health/genesisofremotecareplatform)\nWhen I joined Optimize Health almost two years ago, I was incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead of us in the market.\n\nToday, that excitement is 100-fold as we officially launch the new Optimize Health remote care platform. I teased the launch of this solution a few months ago, and here are some reviews from our pilot clients:\n\n\"This platform is actually built for a physician mindset, rather than a list of features that people think should be in a platform.”\n\n“Optimize Health is making remote care valuable to the patient.\"\n\n\"The platform focuses on the benefit for the actual patient, not just how to get 20 minutes of engagement. We're able to focus on what’s going to make the patient better and better their outcomes with the least amount of technological barriers.”\n\nSo why’d we build it? When I’d visit our customers, I heard the same thing over and over again: “We love what you’re doing, but we want more.” It’s rare to join a company as a Product leader where product-market fit already exists, and we needed to take advantage of this rarity. We made the decision to build the next-generation platform that could do more for our customers, as well as the things they didn’t know they needed. Enterprise-grade security. AI-powered patient engagement. Extensible across any remote care program.\n\nAny care, one platform.\n\nCombining product-market fit with happy customers and a huge opportunity to support the future of remote care–that’s why I'm excited.\n\nI’d be remiss not to list a few of my favorite features:\n\nGlobal search: search the entire platform by anything. Anything. Did someone drop off a device and you don’t know who it belongs to? You can search by Device ID. Looking for a patient and only know their birth month? You can search by that.\n\nManaged Services for all: Create care plans and goals for patients across RPM, CCM, PCM, or CCCM. And we’ll do the rest of the work. We’ll let you know who can be monitored when, who can be billed, and who needs more support.\n\nReal-time revenue dashboard: now you know exactly how your program is performing in the moment, not days, or even weeks later.\n\nFamily, Friends, and Caregivers: engage with your patients’ entire support network to ensure they stay committed to improving their health. We know it takes a village.\n\nBuilding a world-class product is one thing, and we are damn proud of what we announced today, but building a world-class Product and Engineering team is a whole other story. And no small feat. We have been able to do this at Optimize Health for three reasons.\n\nWe are a mission-driven organization.\n\nWe are on a mission to transform how medical groups use technology and real-time data to treat patients outside of the practice walls. To us, it’s simple: brick-and-mortar medical care isn’t going anywhere. But it’s also 2023, and doctors need help managing all of their patients, and a lot of those patients need more support than what they’re getting in-office. That’s what we’re here for, and that’s why we love building for our users. We see the fruits of this labor every day when patients thank our nurses for helping them improve their conditions. There is no better feedback loop and no better feeling than this.\n\nWe are a product-first organization, and we are driven to build beautiful and functional products that create real value for our customers.\n\nI’ve built a lot of products throughout my career, and I’ve learned that creating real value is an art. There are beautiful products out there, and there are functional products out there. But building products that are both beautiful and functional and also create value for our doctors and our patients is truly extraordinary. Being a part of an organization that is centered around this is the reason we’re able to launch the industry-leading remote care platform today.\n\nThis is an incredible opportunity to make a real difference and drive the future of the remote care industry.\n\nI wrote above that we needed to take advantage of product-market fit, a happy customer base, and a huge opportunity, and I’m not exaggerating when I say huge. The virtual care industry is a $250 billion dollar industry that is ripe for disruption and a true vision. There are a ton of digital health solutions out there, but they’re siloed and each one is trying to solve its own little problem.\n\nWe see the opportunity to consolidate the remote care space, and lead it. Our providers want to serve their patients remotely but also successfully and seamlessly, and so we built the platform that will help them do this. No other platform does it as well as we do.",

      "# [Q&A with Optimize Health Co-Founder, Jeff LeBrun](https://blog.optimize.health/qa-jeff-lebrun)\nJeff LeBrun is the Co-Founder of Pillsy and Optimize Health. After serving as CEO for 6+ years, Jeff recently shifted to a new role as Executive Chairman and Chief Strategy Officer. We asked Jeff a few questions about the origins of the company, the future of RPM, and why he is so passionate about RPM in our “Meet Jeff” blog post.\n\nYou have been involved with multiple start-ups over the course of your career. What was the motivation for starting Pillsy and how did the universe lead you to your co-founder, Chuks Onwuneme?\n\nThe idea for Pillsy evolved from a couple of different startups over the course of my career. At one of these startups, I was supporting some of the early wearable device companies. Interest in these devices grew as the companies began connecting them to the internet. It was easy for me to imagine the potential applications in healthcare and the value of continuous medical data.\n\nI also started a VC-backed biotech startup in graduate school, where I quickly learned how significant of a problem medication adherence is in the US. Only 50% of prescribed medications are taken appropriately. This leads to 125,000 lives lost unnecessarily and costs the healthcare system about $300 billion annually. Those facts blew me away, so I naturally started thinking about solutions. Having followed products like Fitbit from their pre-launch, I started to think about the potential impact of that kind of technology approach.\n\nAround that same time, I developed an allergy to my new puppy and started taking an allergy pill prescription. While I think of myself as a relatively competent person, I still found it difficult to develop a new routine around taking the pill.\n\nWith this work history experience and my own personal experience, I began reading about the “Nudge” and “Hooked” concepts in the newest behavioral science books. I became very interested in applying the work I did with the early wearables to medication adherence. The initial concept was creating a Fitbit-quality experience for people taking medications. By using similar design principles and the new (at the time) Bluetooth Low Energy technology, I knew there was potential to help people develop healthier habits that ultimately saved lives.\n\nI met Chuks through the startup community in Seattle. We started hanging out together and building some things, initially just for fun. I was taking a year off to focus on learning, including UX design and coding classes, so I made it a goal to create a Bluetooth-enabled medication adherence product. After some market research revealed enough consumer demand, we decided to go for it and Pillsy was born.\n\nYou shifted the focus of the company from Medication Adherence to RPM when CMS introduced reimbursement for RPM. But now, with RTM it looks like reimbursement for Medication Adherence could be in the foreseeable future. How could that impact Pillsy?\n\nI like to joke that we were about 5-7 years ahead of the market for Pillsy. In healthcare, sometimes it takes longer to get your product covered by payers even when there is legitimate demand and clear clinical benefit. In addition to navigating the bureaucracy of big payers, there are often other interests being protected that can slow down the process.\n\nBut eventually, healthcare can change for the better. And in this case, reimbursement for technology-enabled medication adherence will be huge.\n\nThinking about it another way, with all the changes that we’ve seen over the past 20 years, will the de-facto format for delivering medications still be plastic orange bottles in another 20 years? Let’s hope not. Orange bottles weren’t actually designed for patients. They were designed 40-50 years ago to streamline work for the pill-filling machines. And while they might save 45 cents of labor per fill, they are horrible to use, which contributes to the non-adherence problem.\n\nAt a certain point, the industry has to acknowledge how bad the existing medication delivery experience and ensuing outcomes are for the majority of people. It’s just a matter of time.\n\nIn the pharmaceutical world, drugs for chronic diseases are mostly commoditized generics. That means for 98% of the drugs dispensed, there is no differentiation on the actual drug being sold. However, there is plenty of room to differentiate on experience, or to go “beyond the pill” as many pharma people like to say. With technology, it’s possible to provide a digital coach that goes beyond the initial prescriber and the pharmacist to provide continuous 24/7 support. It could save tens of thousands of lives every year.\n\nYour LinkedIn tagline says you are “Building the Future of Continuous Remote Care”. What does that mean and how does it go beyond RPM?\n\nToday’s care is mostly episodic in nature, meaning that visits happen infrequently in the clinic. That has shifted to some degree post-COVID, but I think there is a realization that we have the technology to extend care beyond the four walls of a medical practice. Demand for these types of experiences is growing and they can provide superior clinical outcomes as well as improve overall quality of life for many patients.\n\nI’ve been known to say that remote patient monitoring is to remote care as books were to Amazon’s e-commerce business. It’s a great place to start, but it’s not necessarily the end game. I think people and practitioners want a single trusted partner to handle the bulk of their remote care interactions. It’s our goal to be that partner.\n\nOptimize Health recently hired a new CEO. What does Todd bring to the future of Optimize Health?\n\nHaving spent 10 years at athenahealth, Todd has amazing experience leading large teams and scaling digital health companies in our space. I’ve been successful as an innovator and an executor, but doing it at that scale like Todd is not something I’ve done. It’s a great combination.\n\nThe RPM field was really new when you started Optimize Health and it’s become an increasingly crowded field. How does Optimize Health stand out and how do you plan to stay ahead of the competition?\n\nThere’s a saying that if you don’t have any competition you should be worried. When we started out, I found that a big part of our initial job was educating people on the market itself. We used to have to prove that reimbursement was real by showing an Explanation of Benefits to practices. At this point, RPM is no longer a secret, especially with COVID dramatically accelerating the adoption of telehealth. More people are looking to provide these services and get reimbursed for them.\n\nWe are staying ahead by consistently improving and innovating. And, of course, we need to measure those improvements. In addition, we’ve developed a reputation for delivering on what we say we’ll deliver on. In this business, execution is the name of the game, and something that sounds too good to be true usually is.\n\nWe focus on executing and delivering value to our customers and patients. At the end of the day, we know our true mission is about improving patient care. That’s more important than beating our competitors, but putting patients and providers first will ultimately allow us to continue to outperform the other players.\n\nPersonally, I pick one thing that I want to improve on every day, week, and month. I write it down and I dedicate time to doing that, whether it’s through reading, coaching, or whatever. That goes for the individual Optimizers too; we encourage everybody to define and work on their own personal development goals.\n\nThe University of Michigan (Go Blue!) is well known for producing great entrepreneurs. Tell us a little more about your startup mentorship with TechArb at Michigan and why it’s important to you.\n\nGo Blue!\n\nPrior to attending Michigan, I had started websites around travel and live music venues that got some traction. But, I didn’t really know what to do when I started getting calls from other startups and VCs who wanted to partner with me. Michigan is where I learned how to think about a business more systematically, and how to do some specific things like read a term sheet and make a cap table.\n\nWe’ve collaborated with Michigan students in several ways, from hosting interns through the Zell Lurie program (especially helpful in a rapid phase of growth after COVID), to sponsoring projects through the School of Public Health and the Ross Business School. The Social Venture Fund, which was started by a couple of my friends when I was in school, has also invested in TechArb, as did a fellow entrepreneur from the Wolverine Venture Fund.\n\nThis is important to me because I saw the advantages that other students had coming out of schools in the Bay Area or Boston, where there is more local access to entrepreneurship and to VCs. Michigan has a large community of alumni entrepreneurs, but there is no single physical nexus where we all reside.\n\nEntrepreneurship has become a significant part of my self identity, so it’s important to me to give back. Through mentoring and coaching, I try to help the super talented Michigan students and alumni who want to build new things and have a positive impact on the world. And, it’s always been a lot of fun and incredibly rewarding to watch their ideas come to life."

      "# Post ID x922ci: Longevity, Health Optimization, and Maintaining/ Improving Quality of Life in Youth & Aging with +218 score by [(santacruz_steve, Reddit, 2022-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/)\nAsking on behalf of parents (72M & 69F), but also for personal interest after watching my aunt go through one of the worst medical outcomes possible. What are the specific FATfire means you take to optimize your longevity and quality of life? I will start it off with things that range from common sense to things that work for me. However, those are primarily budget-friendly so I want to hear your Fatfire suggestions- things like longevity clinics that focus on preventive medicine through regular screenings and advising on how to optimize health through diet, supplementation, lifestyle and risk factors. Im into things like the Huberman Podcast,\n\nCommon-Sense Stuff:\n\n\\-Exercise... basically as much as possible as far as I can tell cardio + strength training. If exercise is a huge chore for you do what you enjoy and what you can and don't beat yourself up about it. What is the fatfire approach to this during aging?\n\n\\-Diet: Whole non-processed foods, fruits veggies and not industrially produced meats. lots of leafy greens, not a lot of carbs especially the processed bullshit in the states, avoid sugar, avoid processed seed oils, have a caloric restriction for yourself, and stick to it, especially at specific times.\n\n\\-Fasting: Seems to be pretty important with the principal rule is don't always be eating\n\n\\-Have a strong social circle. A super underrated one that probably alludes people. Seek people through common interests and shared values. Community breeds purpose.\n\n\\-Purpose: Purpose breeds positive emotions\n\n\\-Mental health\n\n\\-Sleep optimization: How do fatfire folks optimize their sleep? I have terrible insomnia but understand the importance of sleep. Some common sense sleep approaches: avoid blue light at night, exercise, cool bedroom, breathe through your nose during rest and at all times, have a very dark sleeping area that is cool, Huberman's light exposure circadian stuff- aka get outside in the AM upon waking, as much as possible during the day, and at sunset. So basically go outside.\n\n\\-Outdoor Exposure: Is proven to improve health outcomes and gratitude.\n\n\\-Gratitude: Apparantly literally changes your brain like meditation.\n\n\\-Meditation: Expands your mind like breathing exercises\n\n\\-Breathing exercises: These have really worked for me and seem to be increasing in popularity. There seem to be two kinds IMHO uppers and downers. Exercises to upregulate your nervouse system and exercise to downregulate- use them respectively to get more awake and in your body and alert or to calm and relax and less alert.\n\n\\-Cold & Heat Exposure: I love both cold exposure and sauna and firmly believe in the associated health and wellness benefits. I consider them positive stressors- health optimization isn't about minimizing stressors. In fact, humans are considered anti-fragile whereby the system becomes more resilient in response to stress. However, chronic stress of a negative and environmental kind must be avoided at all costs- they will ruin you and destroy your health and well-being. Interestingly, an apparent key factor in how to determine if a stressor is positive or negative is your mindset. When I get into cold water I tell myself that it's for my own well-being and therefore it is, and even the though first part always sucks I wouldn't trade it for anything, and the endorphin rush after and during is amazing.\n\n\\-Positive Stressor Maximaztion & Negative/ Chronic Stress Minimization: Find some positive stressors that you can leverage \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome Random Things Not To Do Before We Get Into FatFire Ideas:\n\n\\-Smoke tobacco\n\n\\-Drink in Excess\n\n\\-Be Overweight\n\n\\-Use motor vehicles with extreme caution and never drive drunk\n\n\\-Use hard drugs\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFatfire?\n\n\\-Executive physicals (?)\n\n\\-Screenings for common diseases (could people specify exactly what these would be?)\n\n\\-Genetic Testing (what specifically should one be aware of in this space?

My thoughts:\n\n**The good:**\n\n1. Diet.  Single biggest driver of health.  FatFIRE add-on: private chef or meal prep service if you're not interested in cooking or don't want to put in the time to ensure that meals (and portion sizes!) are healthy.\n2. Exercise.  Close behind diet as the single biggest driver of health.  FatFIRE add-on: home gym and/or personal trainer to help ensure that it becomes a very regular habit and make sure that all major muscle groups are targeted.\n3. Mental aspects (social circle, meditating, calmness, good attitude): all important.  FatFIRE add-on: you can definitely help ensure that there's adequate bonding time by offering to foot the bill for some vacations/retreats, although you'll have to be careful to not do this to the point where others are taking advantage of your generosity.\n4. Sleep.  Perhaps something that a lot of FatFIRE people miss out on, since we're often driving hard for that bottom line.  FatFIRE add-ons: creating a bedroom that is sealed off from outside light, alarm clocks that wake you more slowly and naturally, investing in a high quality mattress, and making sure to structure your day to ensure that sleep is prioritized (for people with newborns, for example, a night nurse can help preserve sleep).\n5. Avoiding the negative health impacts you listed (smoking, drinking, carrying extra weight, drugs, risk-taking endeavors).  Ideally, if you are focused on health, you'd cut out drinking entirely.  There is no healthy level of alcohol.  (But we all must balance health with enjoyment!)\n6. Regular medical visits.  This is less for the doctor's check-up and more for the bloodwork/screenings.  It's good to have regular measurements of blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, teeth X-rays, and other health measurements.\n\n**The stuff that probably isn't worth it:**\n\n1. Fasting.  Fasting is still being researched, and while intermittent fasting does show benefits, I've seen the \"tech bros\" take it to extremes with full-day or multi-day fasts.  These can be dangerous and don't seem to offer any increased health benefits over shorter intervals.  Likely, many of the benefits of longer fasts are due to the reduction in caloric intake, rather than the fast itself.  I'd caution anyone against fasting regularly for longer than 12 hours, and against ever doing more than 24 hours at a time.\n2. Supplementation.  Supplements are the poor man's healthy diet.  Most supplements are unregulated, their claims unproven (and they can claim just about anything as long as they don't state that it *cures a disease*, as the FDA doesn't care), and their contents suspect.  Megadoses range from useless to actively dangerous/deadly.  Someone in FatFIRE can eat a far healthier diet than the average person, and has even less of a need of supplements.\n3. Probiotics.  This is actually my research background, and I can tell you that pretty much every commercial probiotic on the market is shit (no pun intended).  I could write a whole post on their issues.  Again, a healthy diet is a far better move than wasting time looking at probiotics.\n\n**Situationally useful:**\n\n1. Genetic testing.  Get a screening if you're going to be having children or if you would rather be forewarned about some genetic diseases (think Parkinson's Disease).  Keep in mind that most SNPs (single mutations) have a *very small* effect on health outcomes.  If you have a 3x risk of cancer but the average population incidence is only 0.1%, you still only have a 0.3% chance of developing that cancer.\n2. Wearables.  Great if you love data, but you still have to do the actual exercise.  They don't make the actual work any easier.\n3. Blood testing.  Only useful if you are monitoring a specific condition, in my opinion.  Otherwise, get it checked annually at your physical.\n4. Executive physicals/concierge medicine: depends on your wealth and if you want that personal touch.  They won't find diseases earlier, but they can be much better to work with if you are actively monitoring/treating a condition or if you have familial history of some disease.\n\n**Others not mentioned that I care about:**\n\n1. Pollution and microplastics exposure.  We don't know all the details of microplastic ingestion, but it's probably not great.  Limiting the plastic you eat from is one step, but the biggest steps you can take are to avoid synthetic fibers and to stay away from roads (one of the single largest sources of microplastics is tire dust).  \n2. Monitoring activity throughout the day.  Even if you spend an hour in the gym, spending the other 23 sedentary (like at a desk job, even if it's a really fancy desk) is not ideal.  \n3. Skincare!  Even just sunscreen + nightly cleanser + moisturizer is far better than what most men do.  Sunscreen is cheap but incredibly important for fighting both the appearance of aging and skin cancer.\n4. Water.  Don't drink sugary drinks, drink water.  \n\nI think that folks in FatFIRE love the idea of finding that secret trick that costs too much for most to afford, but the truth is that almost all of us would benefit more from improving the basics than trying the extremes.  Even the wealthy can have poor diets, carry excess weight, fail to exercise.\n\n### Comment ID innovdg with +18 score by [(santacruz_steve, Reddit, 2022-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/innovdg/) (in reply to ID innnsl4):\nEPIC answer TY!\n\n### Comment ID inq0ar0 with +16 score by [(dmacerz, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inq0ar0/) (in reply to ID innnsl4):\nFasting has a range of benefits from reducing calorie intake, stabilising blood sugars, giving the liver a break so it can regenerate, improving insulin and pre diabetes issues, resetting hormones. Arguably the single most important of all of them. \n\nProbiotics - some products sucks but what’s your take on kefir and live yoghurts? What about polyphenol supplements and prebiotic fibres like psyllium husk? I would have thought super important considering the way food is manufactured these days these 3 products are the only way to get intake that our bodies have had the last 200,000 years.\n\n#### Comment ID inq5fel with +5 score by [(Islandbeachandrum, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inq5fel/) (in reply to ID inq0ar0):\nAgreed. Regular intermittent fasting is a cornerstone in my life and 3 day fasts a couple times a year have had tremendous health benefits for me. They are not fun and definitely need to be done with caution. I.e. making sure your sodium, potassium and magnesium supplementation is on point - look up \"snake juice\" on Google for a DIY concoction.\n\n#### Comment ID inr7lot with +6 score by [(Romanticon, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inr7lot/) (in reply to ID inq0ar0):\nI agree on the benefits of fasting - but most of these benefits are also seen from intermittent fasting, and it's not been fully separated out how many of them are due to the act of fasting itself, or if they're due to reduction in caloric intake and better mindfulness of diet.  Fasting definitely plays some benefit, but it's likely a part of a larger whole.\n\nLess studied are the longer fasts, like fasting 23 hours per day or people who do extended \"water fasts\".  These can become very dangerous and seem unnecessary, when most benefits could be obtained from just doing regular intraday fasting.\n\nI'm glad to see others are aware of prebiotics!  I'm doubtful on yogurt/kefir, but very enthusiastic about encouraging greater intake of prebiotics.\n\nMy main argument against yogurts is that, while they do contain tons of live microbes, those are microbes evolved and ideally suited to live in cold, lactose-filled, oxygen-rich yogurt.  Your gut is none of those things.  There was a bunch of excitement early on because both yogurt cultures and gut microbiomes contain *Lactobacillus*, but that's a broad genus of bacteria and the individual species differ significantly in gut vs. yogurt.\n\nPrebiotics, for anyone else reading this who isn't familiar, are foods that don't provide direct nutritional benefit to us, but do act as a food source for our gut microbiome.  /u/dmacerz mentioned polyphenols and psyllium husk, but there are plenty of other prebiotics - they're usually labeled on nutrition facts as \"dietary fiber.\" Most are in the form of complex starches that aren't easily broken down by our own digestive enzymes, but can be eaten by our gut microbes.  The big payoff is that, when microbes are feasting on prebiotics, they eat less of the mucus lining of our intestinal tract, reducing chances of inflammation if they eat all the way through to the intestinal wall.\n\nPrebiotics are great, and we should be eating more of them.  This could be a supplement, but - again, as I discussed in my parent comment - a better method is to improve diet.  There are tons of foods with lots of fiber, mainly vegetables, and most modern people simply don't eat enough of them.  You could certainly supplement your diet with prebiotic fiber (pretty much anything with resistant starch and fiber is decent; some people just have potato starch), but you could also focus on naturally upping your fiber and resistant starch intake in the foods you eat.\n\n### Comment ID inppcpb with +10 score by [(CupResponsible797, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inppcpb/) (in reply to ID innnsl4):\nSome supplements like creatine are indisputably “worth it”.\n\n### Comment ID inxp2pu with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-09-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inxp2pu/) (in reply to ID innnsl4):\n[removed]\n\n#### Comment ID inxvodl with +3 score by [(Romanticon, Reddit, 2022-09-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inxvodl/) (in reply to ID inxp2pu):\nI personally like NIVEA's moisturizer that also has SPF 15, because I'm lazy and don't want to bother with multiple creams if I can help it...\n\n...but I'm no shill, and I think more importantly, it depends on your skin type.  I've got oily skin so I try to look for moisturizers that won't add to that, but someone with dry skin will probably have different preferences.\n\nThere are some really nice skincare routines out there, but I just can't muster up the effort right now to dive really deep into them.  Sunscreen, moisturizer, and nighttime cleanser to take all the dirt off, that's about all I can handle, and I'd rather be consistent than striving for insane perfection.\n\n#### Comment ID io025el with +2 score by [(cshah3, Reddit, 2022-09-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/io025el/) (in reply to ID inxp2pu):\nI like Jack Black products.\n\n### Comment ID io0ke47 with +2 score by [(catdog123412, Reddit, 2022-09-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/io0ke47/) (in reply to ID innnsl4):\nI agree most supplements don't have a lot of support, but you don't think adding a high-quality omega 3 fish oil is beneficial?\n\n#### Comment ID io2h5fz with +3 score by [(Romanticon, Reddit, 2022-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/io2h5fz/) (in reply to ID io0ke47):\nI'd rather eat more fish!

Store it in a cool place without sunlight. Olive oils also can go rancid. They also have amaing health benefits. Buy olive oils directly from the source, with a recent harvest date. Olive oil comes from a fruit so fresh is improtant.

You “dive” in a pressurized hard shell chamber while breathing pure oxygen. The combination of pressure and oxygen gets far more oxygen into the cells than is possible any other way. The therapy has been used in mainstream medicine for many years to accelerate various types of wound healing, but is just now being explored for anti-aging applications. \n\nIn a 2018 study, 60 HBOT sessions increased telomere length by nearly 40% while reducing markers of cellular senescence. Link to study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33206062/\n\nI recently did ten sessions while on sabbatical to address some lingering long COVID issues and it felt like a total reset for my brain. It’s hard to express how rejuvenated I felt by about the sixth session. I also regained a meaningful degree of smell that had been almost completely lost for two years (from the OG Alpha strain). Subjectively speaking, it’s by far the most powerful complimentary treatment I’ve encountered, bar none. My husband also did three sessions following a major surgery and his surgeon was stunned (his words) by how fast he was healing  at his one week post-op. \n\nA 10 session package (90min @2.2 atmospheres) in Austin runs $2K, and a 60-session package is $10k. \n\nNot sure if this is the sort of thing you’re looking for, but I’ve been so impressed by it that I had to chime in.\n\n### Comment ID intb6v9 with +3 score by [(santacruz_steve, Reddit, 2022-09-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/intb6v9/) (in reply to ID inq2eis):\nWell, I am a technical scuba diver so maybe I get this anyways :).\n\n### Comment ID ipeivlh with +1 score by [(alexanderleedmd13, Reddit, 2022-09-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/ipeivlh/) (in reply to ID inq2eis):\nDid you stop at 10 sessions?

I will probably do a ten session course once per year going forward, and may do more next time. \n\nI’m a now-healthy 34 year old, so the 60 session anti-aging package felt like overkill for me right now. \n\nFor context, this was one (very powerful) component of a multi pronged fitness and lifestyle plan intended to help me “reset” my body and mind during a sabbatical.

As you know, the most impactful things we can do are related to good diet, exercise, sleep, and stress-control habits.. Once those things are in place, the more speculative interventions will likely have very small to zero incremental impact. All those supplements that look good in various studies don't add much if you have already optimized your diet with real food (especially fruit and veg). Definitely get an annual checkup, but running every test out there will have very modest additional benefit while significantly increasing the risk of overtreatment.\n\nAdvanced exercise interventions like low oxygen training (or high oxygen training or EWOT machines)? Remote ischemic conditioning? Yeah, I've tried them but honestly couldn't really tell you whether they are doing anything besides a placebo effect. I've even looked into hyperbaric oxygen treatments; again jury is still very much out. Perhaps in the future there will be magic bullets, but currently most of this is more hype than proven interventions.\n\nFinal point is that I think most people look for magic bullets, while avoiding the harder and vastly more evidence based lifestyle modifications.

Basically any chemical type names, non-actual food things. Try finding a solid farmer who raises free-range, high quality of life animals. Not only is it delicious, but you can feel and taste the difference. This obviously excludes restaurants, but a considerable amount actually knew and took pride in where they sourced their meat.  Worth asking and filtering that way.\n\nMaintain proper excretion/digestion. Walking does this—the impact of gravity gets it moving—proper portions and not filling your stomach often does as well. \n\nWhen doing a physical-spiritual practice, have in mind the psychobody. Practicing yoga or Qi Gong (or prayer in some traditions) can allow you access to your body in a way that you gain greater awareness of parts previously unknown. Not only does this translate to moving differently after discovering new muscles/movements you were unaware of, it leads to new neural connections so that you can process reality differently. Emotions are physically stored through different chemical markers in cells, and there’s been personality links to certain diseases and physical pathologies of the body. Cultivating a connection, compassion, and acceptance for things you might have had to store away long ago can maximize outcomes for health as well as a greater depth of life and knowledge of oneself as they got to this point.

It goes into good detail about why you want to incorporate both cardio and strength training into your routine. While I doubt PA is right on every little detail and min/max solution he advocates, he is right on many of them.

The border between Z1 and Z2 representing the first lactate turnpoint \\~ 2mmol. The border between Z2 and Z3 representing the second turnpoint \\~ 4mmol.In this model, Zone 2 would be similar to a Zone 3 (on a Five Zone scale) - correlating with somewhere around 80-85% of Max HR.\n\nIn any case, I don't know if I have misinterpreted the question, but it seems many replies have read the question differently than I.\n\nThe subject is asking if \"cardio is necessary\", but the main body implies if high intensity cardio is necessary, or if his long walks are adequate.\n\nI'm still new to this subject as a whole but I've immersed myself in it over the past six months, digesting hours of content from Peter Attia, Mike Joyner, Andy Gaupin, Huberman, Stephen Seiler, etc. Stephen in particular has a lot of specialised content on youtube focusing on this, and \"how low is too low\" intensity wise.\n\nI'd direct you to this chart ([https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/coggan-s-physiological-adaptation-chart/75468](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/coggan-s-physiological-adaptation-chart/75468)) which shows the different adaptations (or lack thereof) that happen during cardio at different intensity.\n\nReally, if your goal is to improve VO2 max -- long walks are not adequate. That doesn't mean you wont enjoy those walks and still burn calories - but it won't do wonders for VO2max. That chart will loosely illustrate the amount of Vo2 max improvements you'll get from each intensity level - as well as a plethora of other adaptations that occur. It's quite informative. (I focus on Vo2 max purely as that's typically touted as one of the best predictors of longevity as a whole, but there are tons of other benefits from high intensity cardio).\n\nA simple cardio workout routine (which has worked for me, improving my 5K time from over 30 minutes to less than 19 minutes across a four month time span) has been:\n\n3 x \"Zone 2\" runs (based on the 5-HR Zones) for 45-75 minutes per run (dependent on how much time I have - more the better)  \nand  \n1 x \"Vo2 max protocol\" - my preference is 1km repeats (running at 95% effort for 1km) with a 1:1 rest recovery ratio. Repeat this 5-6 times, with 1.5km warm up.  \n\n\nIf I get time for another run, I'll typically throw in a Tempo or Threshold Run (eg. running for 5-10K at 90% of max HR).\n\nThat improved my Vo2 max from 35 (estimate) to 55 (estimate) across those same four months. (Estimate based on the average of both Apple Watch and the vo2 max estimate that the Cooper Test (12 minute run) formula spits out).\n\n## Comment ID k92m2md with +8 score by [(eat_natural, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k92m2md/) (in reply to ID 17ub1wx):\nIt’s my understanding that cardiorespiratory fitness has distinct health benefits over weight resistance training. While there are overlapping benefits between the two, cardiorespiratory exercises have a stronger beneficial impact on vascular health by improving the amount of nitric oxide present, blood vessel responsiveness to nitric oxide, and thus, a lower resting blood pressure. Beyond that, there is evidence to suggest that endothelial integrity is improved with a lower likelihood of lipoprotein penetration into the endothelium. Separately, there is also evidence that running stabilizes pre-existing atherosclerotic plaque and also reduces plaque volume / size. Angiogenesis is another benefit, where additional blood vessel growth occurs, while also dilating and enlarging existing blood vessels. There is evidence that endurance training reduces risk of sudden cardiac death from arrhythmia. Endurance training has a more significant impact on cardiac function, such as stroke volume, as well as VO2 max. It is my understanding that VO2 max is the strongest predictor of longevity, more so than insulin resistance, hypertension, obesity, etc.  Both weight resistance training and endurance training improve glucose and lipid metabolism. \n\n[Exercise benefits in cardiovascular diseases: from mechanisms to clinical implementation. Pedro L. Valenzuela.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37005351/)\n\nTo answer your question specifically, if you’re lifting hard enough at a high degree of effort and intensity, you will probably derive some of the above benefits. I do believe you would obtain additional benefit by incorporating some endurance training. Hopping on the stairclimber at the gym may be a practical way to build lower strength while incorporating endurance training.\n\n### Comment ID k95ka8m with +1 score by [(toothmanhelpting, Reddit, 2023-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k95ka8m/) (in reply to ID k92m2md):\nTo sum it up….

There is a 50% improvement in mortality between the worst quartile and the second worst quartile. Worst to above average is 60-70% reduction in 10 year mortality.

Overall this is worth thinking on, though Milo is talking about 6 days/week of lifting plus a lot of steps, not OPs 3 days.\n\nMy critiques of the Wolf approach are (i) a sufficiently powered subgroup analysis is probably needed to even consider a concentrated approach like that (ii) Wolf doesn't seem to appreciate a basic point about risk management-- i.e. a more diversified approach tends to pay off quite well for long term investments in a very uncertain environment (iii) Attia emphasizes performance metrics  like VO2 max which Wolf criticizes as having a major genetic component  so he wants to look at hours of effort instead... but completely ignoring performance is a bit ironic as Wolf is a strength coach so surely he appreciates the fact that *well designed and executed* lifting programs are not remotely comparable in results to that of the typical gym goer even when hours are equated... and the idea that training quality doesn't impact healthspan strikes me a as quite leap.\n\n### Comment ID k941wwe with +5 score by [(AndeyR, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k941wwe/) (in reply to ID k93hcyy):\nI feel like Peter gamifies VO2max too much, its a proxy, and chances are, training specifically for this number would not do much (or would not be as effective as someone doing sports and getting to this number as a byproduct)\n\nNext step would be to train grip strength )\n\n#### Comment ID k946hc4 with +2 score by [(NotSaucerman, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k946hc4/) (in reply to ID k941wwe):\nYea, I anticipate Peter to deprecate VO2 max over time in favor of a basket of cardio  indicators once more data becomes available.

Doing things that improve your heart health is probably a good way to improve health span.\n\nI think the reason people don't like cardio is because they buy into the \"no pain, no gain\" mentality.\n\nFor example, embracing long duration zone 2 isn't really that \"intensive\". I think it can actually be boring...so I tend to do it on an indoor bike while playing video games.\n\nI don't do the high intensity intervals as described by Attia. Instead, I've been doing clean and jerks with double kettlebells 3 days a week (modified version of Geoff Neupert's Long Cycle of Death program). About 100 reps spread over 30 minutes in various rep schemes. Lots of time in Zone 5, but with work periods on the order of 15-30 seconds (depending on rep scheme) and similar rest periods. But each workout has 30-40 sets depending on the rep scheme.\n\nSo not the prescription Peter gives, but my guess is that it's fine provided I'm not trying to be an elite cyclist. And it's way easier on my knees than sprinting. Seems to me like a great combination of strength and cardio. It's the only workout where I really get that \"runner's high\".

No one knows when your first lactate turnpoint occurs (it's individual). This is technically when you cross over from Zone 2 to Zone 3. This is typically correlated with 65-80% of max HR - but everyone's will actually be different. But if you reach that range with brisk walking, then yes - Zone 2 can be achieved.\n\nHowever as you get fitter, you will notice you can now maintain the same pace as before, but at a much lower heart rate - meaning you will have to increase the intensity to stay in that zone. Whether this is simply ramping up the incline %, or if you need to up the pace to a slow jog.\n\nMost people will sustain Zone 2 with a slow jog - you definitely do not have to \"run\" to stay in Zone 2 (subjective - if you're fit enough to run fast relative to others in Zone 2, you probably still don't perceive that run as a fast run, since you'd be capable of running even faster I guess!).\n\nFor me, when I first started cardio six months ago. Here's some stats for comparison:\n\nApril 19th, 2023. \"Zone 2 run\" (My Max HR is 199. Zone 2 for me is estimated at 128-160)4KM was at Zone 2 (about 30 mins) and the last 1KM was at a faster pace.\n\n1KM, 6:34, 154 HR1KM, 7:07, 160 HR1KM, 7:30, 154 HR1KM, 6:35, 154 HR1KM, 5:39, 167 HR\n\nSo that average pace of around 6:30 minutes per KM, kept me in Zone 2.\n\nHowever fast forward six months, I now need to run at around 5:00-5:15 per KM to stay in the same HR zone. Back when I started, 1 KM at 5:00 was the same time as my max 1km effort!

Whether there is a maximum volume after which health benefits go down again is still a controversial question; some studies seem to support this hypothesis, but flaws have been pointed out in all of them so far.\n\nThen, a very important variable is training. 30 miles per week is \"maintenance\" for me, while for a brand new runner it'd be way above their abilities, and for an elite marathoner it would essentially be a week off. It's all relative, training above your level isn't sustainable, but as you adapt to training, your limit will shift, and what is a reasonable volume depends on that.\n\nGiven all this, there is no clear answer, because it depends on so many things. What can your body handle naturally? What's your running fitness like? What kind of injury / overtraining risk are you willing to accept? How hard are your workouts?\n\nThere is not anything fundamentally unhealthy about running marathons; problems arise when people *race* them, pushing their limits - as with any sport, doing that comes at a risk, and while the risks of running long distance may be different than those seen in other sports, the reason people get hurt has little to do with the distance per se. If you are trained for it and go at a pace that is well within your comfort zone, then even ultramarathon distances aren't really all that hardcore. I've done 10k races that were definitely harder on my body than some 30-40 mile runs I've done at a comfortable (as far as such a thing as \"comfort\" exists past mile 20) pace. Humans have run much longer distances than that throughout history; even the legenday Pheidippides, who inspired the Marathon as a discipline, didn't just run from Marathon to Athens (~25 miles) - he ran from Marathon to Sparta (some 120 miles) in one day, then back the next day, then participated in the battle, and THEN he'd run to Athens, where he collapsed from exhaustion (but probably survived - the dying part may be just poetic hyperbole). So not \"25 miles and then death\", but \"almost 300 miles and a battle, and he still made it\". And he was just doing his job; Greek armies employed professional runners who would routinely run upwards of 100 miles in a day as part of their jobs.\n\nSoooo... what do?\n\nBasically, if you want to run for health, and have your strength covered with lifting, then I'd recommend starting with some beginner program (couch to 5k, a.k.a. c25k, is good), and from there, gently work your way up to where you can comfortably run for an hour or so, at a leisurely pace, a couple times per week (putting you in the 3-5 hours per week range). It seems that this is approximately where the cost / benefit ration of maintaining the required training volume starts shelving off - you still get upwards of 90% of the health benefits, and if trained properly, a very very small risk of serious damage or injury. \"Every other day\" seems like a decent balance to me - for a beginner, more days may be too taxing, and later it may not be worth pushing for more, especially if you also do other exercise.\n\n\"Conserving energy\" is not a concern btw; lifting doesn't burn that much, and taps into different energy sources (slow running is mainly fat and some glycogen, but you need to keep going for about 3 hours or so to make a serious dent in your glyco stores), while lifting mainly runs on ATP, and gets refilled from available carbs (but you can never possibly lift enough to deplete the glyco stores). So if you \"run out of energy\", what really happens is that your muscles aren't recovered yet. But if you run at a truly slow pace, and lift heavy (hi-res, lo-rep), then you will almost exclusively recruit slow-twitch fibres for running, and fast-twitch for lifting. OTOH, if you run too fast, running will use fast-twitch too, and the result is slow progress on the running front, and jelly legs when lifting after running.\n\n### Comment ID em34zlw with +5 score by [(OracleOfOntario, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em34zlw/) (in reply to ID em31y9d):\nwow, great post, that's some sage advice.\n\n## Comment ID em2okkw with +9 score by [(ithinkitsbeertime, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em2okkw/) (in reply to ID birz8u):\nThe CDC says:\n\n>For substantial health benefts, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) to 300 minutes (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes) to 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity.  \n>  \n>Preferably, aerobic activity should be spread throughout the week.

Even if you don't want to run a 5K race at the end of the plan, using a plan anyway is easy to follow and is meant to prepare your body properly.  \n\nPersonally, I don't run races often, and if I do it's only for fun with friends.  I run about a 5K each run about 3 times per week, and I think it's a good distance for general health.  It doesn't take up too much time but still gives me a good workout.\n\n## Comment ID em2ujx6 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em2ujx6/) (in reply to ID birz8u):\n[deleted]\n\n## Comment ID em4bcjd with +2 score by [(jerschwab, Reddit, 2019-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em4bcjd/) (in reply to ID birz8u):\nCheck out Phil Maffetone... lots of books and focus on health first,but also produces good results.\n\n## Comment ID em2l2dp with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em2l2dp/) (in reply to ID birz8u):\nFollowing as a near 50 yold that isn’t racing anymore but doesn’t have a clear path forward",

You want a minimum amount of training (reps/sets) and to hit the muscle with enough intensity because of this it is best to split the volume throughout the week.

In distance running, the main limitation for most people is cardiovascular fitness, so you start there. The recommendations for how to improve this are based on decades of data, largely going back to the OG, Lydiard. You build an aerobic base by running as much as possible below your lactate threshold. This gets your heart and lungs used to the effort, makes your organs literally stronger and larger (cardiac hypertrophy and bradycardia are both common in distance runners), and helps your feet and your connective tissues get used to the repetitive movement, building capillary beds and improving blood flow, and so on.\n\nThere are fairly well understood benchmarks for this that tend to track Vo2max and Lactate threshold. Amateurs tend to see major breakthroughs increasing mileage and regular running upwards of 100km a week—but many, especially younger, runners will see these benefits largely plateau around 80km a week. If you’re a decently quick runner, this is about 6-8 hours of running a week (and many runners like myself may end up doing upwards of 10-12 hours peak).\n\n4 hours is a nice baseline of easy running that will establish some of the adaptations that make you healthier and stronger, where if you add resistance and interval training on top of that, you’ll be getting into the realm of decent optimization for performance.\n\n## Comment ID migfvsf with +5 score by [(WeGotHim, Reddit, 2025-03-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1je7eux/runningcardio_for_optimizing_health/migfvsf/) (in reply to ID 1je7eux):\nI am someone who is built to lift weights but likes running and has followed this world for a bit.  grain of salt cause i’m slow as shit and not good at running lol but have made a lot of progress \n\nIn my experience, doing “i can talk while i do it” cardio (aka zone 2 for the nerds) is the only sustainable way to do a lot of cardio without getting hurt or hating it. \n\nCardiovascular is similar and also not to weight training. You can make a ton of progress doing zone 2 only but will eventually hit a plateau without doing higher zone cardio (4 or 5).

People always try to sell you on a magic bullet (4h of zone 2! No wait, do 4x 30min HIIT sessions a week!) but truly whatever you can stick to is the best.\n\nHave limited time? Short spicy HIIT sessions are going to be the best for you because you can physically complete them instead of trying to cram in a 2hour long run. Have some chronic nagging injuries? Probably run zone 2 lightly and monitor for pain. This may change over your life as circumstances, physical capability, and interest change.

Longer, slower running leads to adaptations like greater mitochondrial size and density, greater capillary density, increased cardiac output, and improved running economy. Because distance events from the 5k on up are almost entirely aerobic, these adaptations are most beneficial, and therefore the recommendations are for spending most of your time on these types of training runs. Higher intensity training leads to improvements in lactate utilization, VO2 max, and form at higher speeds, but come along with more strain on the legs that prevents those workouts from being done too frequently. This leads to the overall recommendations for mostly slower miles and a few faster workouts each week.\n\nI'm stealing a lot of this from Advanced Marathoning and Faster Road Racing, but Pfitzinger does cite a lot of good primary literature if you're looking for more reading.\n\n## Comment ID mihgha9 with +2 score by [(fasterthanfood, Reddit, 2025-03-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1je7eux/runningcardio_for_optimizing_health/mihgha9/) (in reply to ID 1je7eux):\nPeter Attia, specifically, talks about biological changes that happen in zone 2, but not zone 3. If you search r/peterattia, I’m sure you can find the studies he’s extrapolating from. From memory looking into this before, it’s very much an extrapolation.\n\nFrankly, I don’t buy it. A more traditional training plan will get you a much better time in a given run (which is the sub you’re asking in; it’s worth noting that Attia tends to look at things through a cyclist’s lenses). I need some better evidence than I’ve heard from him before I’ll accept that someone who runs until they’re capable of a half marathon in x minutes is in better shape — all else being equal — than someone who runs the same race in x-minus-10 minutes.\n\nBroadly speaking and practically, for health and performance, you do want both lots of time in an aerobic zone (which can be achieved in zone 2) as well as some time near your vO2 max. But I wouldn’t get caught up on the specifics that influencers talk about, because there aren’t large enough pools of people following that protocol to study them scientifically.\n\n## Comment ID mii3pyq with +1 score by [(ElMirador23405, Reddit, 2025-03-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1je7eux/runningcardio_for_optimizing_health/mii3pyq/) (in reply to ID 1je7eux):\nI think 80/20 training is just a general guideline.

You're not going to from a 30 min 5k to a 20 min without a substantial improvement in your cardiovascular system. You'lĺ drive yourself crazy trying to figure out the \"optimal\" regimen for health purposes, but by focusing on performance, you'll naturally adapt your trainjng to what your body is responding to.

Mark Hyman is involved in some capacity as founder/booster/face of the brand. I'm not sure exactly what his role is, and I don't care. \n\nThe basic idea is, you pay them a bunch of money, and they write you some ginormous lab orders. You go to a medical testing company to get all those labs drawn (hi, that's where I come in), and then Function takes the results and plugs them into some kind of proprietary AI thing, because of FUCKING COURSE there's gotta be \"AI\" involved somewhere. Then they put all the numbers on a nice pretty Personal Dashboard for you to look at. Then they send you for even more labs at regular intervals, all so that you can \\~optimize your health journey\\~.\n\n  \nMost of the people buying into this look like they are in decent-to-excellent health already; some are on the older side but I see plenty who are in their 20s and 30s. They seem to be under the impression that what they are doing is preventative care. I suppose maybe if one of those tests comes back out of range, and they actually go find a doctor to ask about it, someone might catch a problem early that might otherwise have gotten a lot worse? Or maybe seeing pretty numbers provides that extra incentive to work out and eat veggies - scary number go down, good number go up? However, Function itself doesn't appear to provide any kind of treatment or even referrals; as far as I can tell they're just selling medical testing in bulk, direct-to-consumer, with a shiny coat of techno-paint.\n\nMeanwhile, I end up spending a lot of time drawing and processing these ginormous orders, which frequently causes delays for people coming in for the lab work their doctors ordered, which is usually MUCH simpler. On the plus side, at least Function clients typically have easy veins - or at least, the returning ones do. Self-selection in action; it really sucks to be the person with tiny veins that like to collapse, when the lab order is asking for 10+ tubes. Especially when the tests are totally voluntary, and mostly for issues you probably don't have. \n\nI think that about covers what I know. Does anyone know more? Am I accurately smelling a scam, or is Function actually \\~revolutionizing healthcare\\~ as they claim?\n\n## Comment ID lt5ygv6 with +68 score by [(Rural_Banana, Reddit, 2024-10-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1g9b6tv/function_health_gripe/lt5ygv6/) (in reply to ID 1g9b6tv):\nTwo words: False positives.\n\nWhen you run a test without considering the likelihood of a positive result, the chances of a positive test being a false positive increases.\n\nI’ve seen it many times, especially with tests like antinuclear antibodies (ANA).\n\nI’m also seeing a lot of companies popping up doing stuff like this. \n\nFor-profit medicine will eventually ruin our profession - at least in the outpatient world.

If there is a doctor reviewing all your bloods results then at the very least you are getting some kind of benefit from this service.\n\nPerforming screening bloods at an appropriate interval is recommended because it is a complete waste of money to have bloods every 6 months if you are young and healthy due to the exceedingly low risk of developing an asymptomatic illness which would have a tangible effect on your health within such a short timeframe. It’s the reason why cancer screening guidelines specify intervals, such as the cervical screening test every 5 years for women between the ages of 25-75 - because the studies have been done to demonstrate cost effectiveness. \n\nThe truth is it is very hard to justify investigation of asymptomatic patients (which is what we call screening) due to such a low pre-test probability. This is the reason we only screen for basically three cancers (the debate about prostate cancer screening rages on), and that screening for cardiovascular disease via BP monitoring, lipid monitoring and adjacent testing is only really recommended above the age of 50. The truth is that if you are genuinely healthy, there is nothing based in evidence you can do to improve your life expectancy (mainly because no one wants to fund preventative health research) - your fate will be decided by luck and genetics.

I get why people would think it's not necessary but for myself it's life-changing. \n\nI am a healthy person but since having kids, I have had a lot of surprise issues and we have been trying to pinpoint them for a year now. Many doctors want me to hop from specialist to specialist and it would take years to get an answer. And then add in insurance battles --- it's ridiculous. \n\nBy having all the function health tests run, I can send them to my primary and have an actual solution on my time table. And it's a baseline for me to know what is going on in my body.

And one must vet the company just like the original poster has done. And there are those that take Podcasters as holy grail and don’t use critical thinking when judging the podcasters preach when applying to personal application. That’s stupid. \nThat said, current medicine lacks preventative perspectives and the availability of newest information and breaking paradigms (genome, microbiome, reversal in previous women’s healthcare protocols) have driven every self advocates journey. For many, the journey includes blood testing for hormones, levels, and unknowns. \nInterpreting those results is where critical decisions come in. As well as actions then taken. \nI’m one of those and I listen to podcasts and deep dive the research. I’m about to decide on a purchase of my own labs for application to my “Healthspan.” I will choose the process as carefully as I would a new car (ha)\nCurrent options are limited by my PCP and Insurance allowances. \nExample: Osteoporosis diagnosis -I’ve recently been able to challenge the standard DEXA tests by learning via media and podcasters about a possibly better test (ECHOLIGHT) of my bones. \nAnd, I’ve refused dangerous drugs in exchange for an aggressive approach on some restoration with self action-training and supplements and diet changes. As advocated \nA regular PCP threw the drugs at me. With warnings on my eminent collapse. It was her job. But she also won’t advance her knowledge without keeping up to date albeit timely. Doctors are mostly not on Continuing Education journeys.  \nStatins- my DNA says I’m likely gonna get the side effects. More recent studies address the worries of statins. Yet, although they have a place. I’m now loaded with information to bring to my doctor for discussion. I’ll share my self bought labs. \nThis from top cardio’s I’ve listened to on podcasts and Dr Radio-NYU\nThe reason I plan on investing in personal labs zi cannot get (and concurrently making money for a physician that founded the service) is that I know I have family history that will impact my future. Doctors won’t prescribe until you have a sound issue -heart attack? Elevated labs! Bad plaque ?\nNah…I’m going in for any data I can acquire now. \nHow is my Vitamin D? Should I defer the calcium my Dr said was essential for my bones? Not without K2, or it will clog my veins and damage cardio. All this I garnered from these labs I paid for and shared with my doctor. All that knowledge is limited by insurance. \nI’m also happy to know I’m not BRACA In relation to breast cancer. \nI’ll also check labs for the root cause of my bone issues. Bloodwork can help inform that. \nSeeing a listening doctor, if you can find one that respects self advocacy, is hard. They say “get off the internet!”  I say “get the hell ON the internet!”\nSo yes, scams abound. \nYou just critically address the drivers of the company founders. It’s hard to find the right “expert” and get bang for your buck. \nDoctors, scientists, biologists and specialists all are guests on these media outlets. The studies they quote are available. \nUse all  this type of jnfo and labs if you are in a preventative mode. \nGo into your Vetted Doctor with this info. They may then order them under insurance. \nSelf care rules. Self advocacy is hard work. So is advocacy for a parent or child in an illness or in hospital. Gone is the day the Doctor holds all the answers. Tools as simple as bloodwork are smart in my opinion. \nWe are in the verge of preventive medicine breaking through. The Genome and Immunology protocols are making life changing  informed decisions for patients. (Cancer, hormones, cardiac). You’ll find those Physicians using such new breakthroughs at the highest level in teaching and specialty hospitals. I like to listen to these experts interviewed. \nI also feel the investment is worth it when I decide  about which company has the most comprehensive lab testing plan and follow up. \nNo way would my PCP listen or order all of those. \nBe selective. And yes, lab workers will remain busy and the providers will grow!  Is that a bad thing if they are legit testing?\n\n## Comment ID m5p4yel with +2 score by [(Driver2025, Reddit, 2025-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1g9b6tv/function_health_gripe/m5p4yel/) (in reply to ID 1g9b6tv):\nIt seems that none of you actually have used function health.

After all, that is what a doctor does, look at multiple out of range results and come up with an explanation. LLMs are very good at this. Usually it’s something as simple as being dehydrated. If we can funnel these simple cases to AI, the doctors can then focus more on patients that really need their help.\n\n### Comment ID m9nnc0w with +1 score by [(BernoullisQuaver, Reddit, 2025-01-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1g9b6tv/function_health_gripe/m9nnc0w/) (in reply to ID m9mc3jm):\nThe website literally says it uses AI my dude.

I totally get the point that a young, generally healthy person probably has no business getting all these tests. But it could be a good deal for some of us. I'm seriously thinking about doing it.\n\nI'm 50, have been functionally depressed since my 20s, on a statin since my mid-30s (thanks, Dad), gained a significant amount of weight in my 30's with no clear cause, was diagnosed T2 diabetic in 2021 (on metformin for that), and occasionally have \"sluggish\" thyroid test results.\n\nI'm doing *fine*. But, like, I never feel *great* and I rarely feel *good* for more than a few days at a time.   \n  \nThe 20 minutes I get with my doctor for a physical are spent on the big things. It's simply not enough time to get into a more fine-grained analysis of what I could do to feel better more often. There isn't a single problem to focus on, either. Sometimes it's fatigue, other times it's brain fog, or sporadic aches and pains, or transient digestive issues. None of which seem to correlate to anything obvious like diet, glucose levels, exercise levels, etc. And any one of those things could be due to depression or the diabetes or perimenopause or vitamin deficiencies, or thyrioid issues, or who knows what else. What would a primary care doc even do with that besides experiment with meds or a few tests here or there? It would be a shot in the dark, at best. And that's assuming she didn't just tell me to lose weight.\n\nSo, rather than go 20 rounds of advocating for tests and only getting a couple at a time, I figured I'd look into using my FSA funds to get some on-demand lab tests. My hope is they might direct me toward things to investigate further, supplements to try (or not to worry about), and help narrow down what to talk with my doctor about.  \n  \nI'm shooting in the dark, too, but tests I'm interested in are general vitamins and nutrients, vitamin D, C-Reactive Protein, and cortisol. If I go to Labcorp, it's $298 but that doesn't include cortisol since they don't seem to offer that. If I go to Quest, it's $491. Those are for one-time tests only. If I sign up for Function, it's $499 for all of those tests, plus a bunch more, **plus** a repeat of many of them in six months to see if anything I tried had an effect. From where I'm sitting, it seems like a bargain and a time-saver.\n\n## Comment ID mbdmewp with +2 score by [(Professional_Art2777, Reddit, 2025-02-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1g9b6tv/function_health_gripe/mbdmewp/) (in reply to ID 1g9b6tv):\nI love function health. I have no time for muppet doctors who barely have time to see me once per year for about two minutes and know little to nothing about anything. I have been taking care of my own health needs for years, first with WellnessFX and other online sources, and now with Function. \n\nDon't want to have all of the massive amount of information Function offers? Cool. Don't sign up. Some of us choose to monitor our health and if there are tools available to do that, great. I'm 53 and have seen too many people die around me from not taking care of themselves and not having a doctor do it either.\n\nI am exceptionally healthy....per my bloodwork. I've been vegan for over 15 years and vegetarian for 17 before that. I pay attention. I take action. So what? How is it a \"scam\" to want to have biological data about yourself?\n\nOutside of all of my immaculate data, I did ping super high for ANA. Not an accidental number. I ordered myself some follow up testing, which is exactly what a rheumatologist would have done considering my high titer.  Am I going to continue to try to figure out what it is, maybe only to find nothing because medicine is not yet sufficient to the task? Also yep. That is how I choose to spend my time and money. \n\nYour post makes little to no sense. Be glad you have a job in a field where there will only ever be increasing demand....until there will be almost no demand at all because our entire health score will come down to a single tube of blood a year. That's the future of medicine, no doubt.\n\nI hope your post doesn't put people off from taking control of their own health information and outcomes. Because if you are waiting for medicine and big Pharma to take care of you, think again. \n\nP.s. Function did not try to sell me ANYTHING after I received my results. It was basically like... hey, keep doing what you're doing and eat a few more strawberries. So...no. Not a scam. A valuable resource for people who like to DIY their healthcare and can actually read a medical journal if needed. \n\nAlso Ps. I have mixed feelings about Hyman....but who cares. His involvement or not isn't relevant.\n\n### Comment ID mhp98u1 with +1 score by [(hawaiianjellyfish, Reddit, 2025-03-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1g9b6tv/function_health_gripe/mhp98u1/) (in reply to ID mbdmewp):\nI’m looking into function health, could you tell me a little about how the price all the “add on” tests or if they’ve fit a list somewhere?

The way it works is that after you've signed up for your initial testing, it asks if you'd like additional testing and then you go through a series of pages of tests with the costs that you can sign up for or ignore. The pricing is all over the place. For instance, the follow up panel to the high ANA titer was $250. But that included something like 20 tests-- maybe more. Honestly I could have waited until seeing my primary and then a rheumatologist, but I didn't want to wait months for potentially important info.  I know I added celiac testing on my initial round of tests and I think that was around $70.  If there are any specific tests you're looking for, I'm happy to go into my account and look up to see if they are there and what the costs are for you. No biggie. There are a couple of add ons I might do when I hit my 6 month testing in another 3 or so months, so I should look those up anyway.\n\n## Comment ID mbi94lp with +2 score by [(CountDookie, Reddit, 2025-02-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1g9b6tv/function_health_gripe/mbi94lp/) (in reply to ID 1g9b6tv):\nSeems like a lot of people in the medical community hate this, so what about alternatives?\n\nWhats a better way to get some expansive testing done? I have been to many doctors, dropping a lot of money and am either told everything’s fine or passed off to another doc (and there’s always a month+ wait) and it’s incredibly frustrating. I have had sinus, throat and ear issues for a long time among some other issues, ended up spending 4K on a sinus procedure only to have the next ENT say oh you’ll need to do it again just a few months after. \n\nAnyways, done venting. Is there any other way to get expansive testing done to at least rule some things out? Personally am fine with a false positive at this point, just want to see some movement and am having a hard time fitting in doctors appointments that lead nowhere.

Our model of “let’s sit around and wait for bad stuff to happen, then maybe we can treat it” has failed miserably. America is the unhealthiest developed country on the planet.\n\nPeople are fed up with our horrendous healthcare system and are seeking solutions on their own.\n\nAbout AI, it turns out AI is better at interpreting test results than doctors.

Doctors have failed to help me with a health issue, so I mostly did mine to see the numbers for my vitamin and mineral levels, and it was the cheapest option without insurance - all without having to go see and pay a doctor to give me a \"permission\". On top of that, I got all the basic annual bloodwork, a bunch of interesting extras like my blood type and hormone levels, and a urine sample to get a better idea of my health.\n\nYou may think all of this is unnecessary, but you mistake people for not being able to do their own research and take matters into their own hands. In this country particularly, that is more often than not the only option. Of course we should still lean onto doctors and nurses for any serious and evident medical issues, don't get me wrong, but there is also nothing wrong with a service like this. $500 for potentially life-changing testing? One month of health insurance alone is $500 or more, and that doesn't even account for the deductible, copay, and coinsurance...\n\nI would call the healthcare industry and especially insurance the real scam here.

I'd be happy to share more about this if there are questions, it's just not relevant to the questions I have at the moment. But the TLDR; as far as microfauna and insects go, I have about a pound of red wrigglers and european night crawlers, a 1/4 pound of canadians, about 1000 isopods of various powder colors and dairy cows, about 500 tropical white springtails, about 200 orange springtails, about 100 \"Florida orange\" springtails. These were all well established over the course of time before investing in a larger animal. Potentially going to add some millipedes over time.\n\n I also have a bunch of feeder insects, crickets, dubias and bsf larva, these populations may or may not colonize, we'll see how it goes, hopefully I have put in enough and have been providing enough food to keep these colonies stable as well. The goal is to minimize these as inputs and allow them to breed along side everything else to some degree, but I don't want them to outcompete the cleanup crew above.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago I bought my first Crested Gecko (or really any reptile) ever. I had most of the lighting already as part of my horticultural adventures, but obviously a reptile may require a bit different light than just plants and buggers.\n\n**First some of the videos I've

I looked back at your previous posts and it doesn’t look like you are super receptive to feedback but I’ll give it a go. This setup is not ideal for a crested gecko because it is way too short. It looks like there is only about 12” of height between the substrate and lid, but maybe the picture makes it look smaller. Geckos want to be up high in foliage and that just isn’t possible in this enclosure. The colored lights are not good for eyes (I know you don’t want to hear this). I kind of feel like you have way too many bugs in here. They are going to take over and very quickly.

Exercise enough (both cardio and strength training); optimize sleep quality and quantity; eat a varied diet of high-quality and mostly unprocessed foods; and avoid addictive behaviors. In addition, focus on meaningful social relationships for both mental and physical health.\n\n# Missing the forest for the trees: Context\n\nI'm writing this post because I am seeing an inverse correlation between the increasing popularity of Huberman's podcast (and thus membership in this sub) with the quality of discussion and focus on the right things. It feels to me like a huge part of this sub is missing the forest for the trees, focusing on specific minutiae and protocols (the last 5%) rather than on the major steps one should take to improve their health, longevity, and quality of life.\n\n# The big picture: Do these things first\n\nHere are the things that you should do, and optimize, before worrying about which kind of magnesium or how many minutes of morning sun or whether blue-blocking glasses are killing your serotonin hit (they aren't). For each of these points, I'm including timestamps to episodes in which Huberdaddy or his guests mentioned things to keep in mind; I would be happy if folks gave me better sources below. \n\nAs always, I strongly recommend the [Huberman AI](https://huberman.rile.yt/) site (and thank its author) as an excellent resource for getting the right information.\n\n\n**1. Sleep**\n\nGet enough sleep, and do what you can to make your environment conducive to high-quality sleep (via temperature, light regulation, a healthy pre-sleep routine, etc).\n\n* How much sleep is enough? Huberman references 7-9 hours of \"really terrific\" sleep. [Master Your Sleep & Be More Alert When Awake @ 00:05:06](https://youtu.be/nm1TxQj9IsQ?t=306).\n* What temperature should your sleep environment be? Likely 3 degrees or more cooler than during the daytime. [Sleep Toolkit: Tools for Optimizing Sleep & Sleep-Wake Timing @ 01:05:45](https://youtu.be/h2aWYjSA1Jc?t=3945)\n* Room darkness: though a pitch-black room isn't necessary, one should focus on having a dark room to improve sleep quality and reduce \"wake hormones\" from disrupting sleep quality. Here's an anecdote about how Matthew Walker (a sleep expert) keeps his house \"cave-like\" during his sleep period. [Sleep Toolkit: Tools for Optimizing Sleep & Sleep-Wake Timing @ 01:03:12](https://youtu.be/h2aWYjSA1Jc?t=3792)\n* Have a \"wind-down routine\" to help you fall asleep at night (e.g., meditation, reading, NOT television). [Dr. Matthew Walker: The Science & Practice of Perfecting Your Sleep @ 02:51:41](https://youtu.be/gbQFSMayJxk?t=10301)\n\n**2. Exercise**\n\nExercise frequently, ideally mostly at a low intensity that allows for either nose breathing or talking, with some bouts every week at a very high intensity.\n\n* How often should we exercise? We should aim for at least five days per week to optimize brain health, cardiovascular health, as well as the health of other systems of the body. [Maximizing Productivity, Physical & Mental Health with Daily Tools @ 00:55:20](https://youtu.be/aXvDEmo6uS4?t=3320)\n* How much cardiovascular exercise should we get? Huberdaddy mentions both 150-180 minutes[^1](https://youtu.be/Xu1FMCxoEFc?t=4135) minimum per week, and that at least 180-200 minutes per week help increase longevity. [Understand & Improve Memory Using Science-Based Tools @ 01:25:20](https://youtu.be/szqPAPKE5tQ?t=5120)\n* What should our cardiovascular fitness goal be? Peter Attia indicates that having \"elite\" cardiovascular fitness causes a 5-fold reduction in all-cause mortality compared to cohort peers [ Dr. Peter Attia: Exercise, Nutrition, Hormones for Vitality & Longevity @ 00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCmprPCDqc&t=2311s)\n* Why should we do both cardio and strength training? Because it improves both cardiovascular health (necessary for longevity) and overall health. Jeff Cavaliere advocates a 60:40 strength:cardio ratio for an effective minimum dose per week. [Jeff Cavaliere: Optimize Your Exercise Program with Science-Based Tools @ 00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNCwdFxPtE8&t=518s)\n\n**3. Eating well**\n\nEat varied, high-quality, mostly unprocessed foods, on a reasonable schedule.\n\n* What is healthy eating? It involves eating good foods in an appropriate amount, at reasonable times, and there are a variety of possible diets that can support health, including omnivore and vegan/vegetarian diets. [Healthy Eating & Eating Disorders - Anorexia, Bulimia, Binging @ 02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XGREPnlI8U&t=7545s)\n* Why should we avoid heavily processed foods? \"Eating whole foods has tremendous value and eating highly processed food has tremendous negative impact on the gut and on the gut brain axis.\" [How Our Hormones Control Our Hunger, Eating & Satiety @ 00:48:11](https://youtu.be/17O5mgXZ9ZU?t=2891)\n* Note: there are other episodes in which eating at waking and then stopping a few hours before bedtime are discussed[^source](https://youtu.be/JPX8g8ibKFc?t=5539), as well as intermittent fasting and restricted feeding schedules[^source](https://youtu.be/9tRohh0gErM?t=4334), but here I have less expertise and would appreciate advice or timestamped links.\n\n**4. Avoiding addictive behaviors**\n\nAvoid addictive behaviors, and promote brain health through the above steps and via time outdoors, time meditating, and so on.\n\n* Some examples of addictive behaviors? \"When I use the word drug, I'm talking about substances and behaviors really. And I'm talking about behaviors like gambling, sex, gaming, porn, absolutely, shopping, work.\" [Dr. Anna Lembke: Understanding & Treating Addiction @ 00:32:24](https://youtu.be/p3JLaF_4Tz8?t=1944)\n* Social media as an addictive behavior? \"So the first message I would want to get across about social media is that it really is a drug and it's engineered to be a drug.\" [Dr. Anna Lembke: Understanding & Treating Addiction @ 01:41:40](https://youtu.be/p3JLaF_4Tz8?t=6100)\n* Why porn can cause issues? \"But again, any activity that evokes a lot of dopamine release will make it harder to achieve the same level and certainly the greater level of dopamine through a subsequent interaction. So yes, indeed, many people are addicted to pornography and yes, indeed, many people who regularly indulge in pornography experience challenges in real world romantic interactions.\" [Controlling Your Dopamine For Motivation, Focus & Satisfaction @ 01:56:22](https://youtu.be/QmOF0crdyRU?t=6982)\n* Why is controlling dopaminergenic activities (especially low-effort, addictive behaviors that cause releases of dopamine) important? Because it reduces our dopamine baseline and makes getting pleasure out of everyday activities more difficult. [Controlling Your Dopamine For Motivation, Focus & Satisfaction @ 01:04:19](https://youtu.be/QmOF0crdyRU?t=3859)\n\n# A wrap-up: why I think this post is necessary for this subreddit\n\nThere is a lot to think about in terms of health, and Huberman goes into a lot of detail about things we can do to improve our lives. So why is it that so many posts in this subreddit don't address that these behaviors are the basics, the foundation, the first step, the cornerstone of health, both physical and mental?\n\nI think it's because none of it is new or exciting. What's more, none of it is as /easy/ as arguing about stupid minutiae about the right supplement stack (easy to take, low effort), or exactly the right zone, or exactly how to get morning sunlight. All those things are lower-effort, and from a high-level perspective, it looks suspiciously like users here just trading out their low-effort dopamine hits from gaming or drinking a red bull for low-effort dopamine hits via popping pills or arguing.\n\nSo my appeal to those of you who read this and participate in this sub is this: **ground your discussions, your comments, and your contributions in this subreddit to the most important things we can do for our health.** If someone is asking about some nuanced, minor point, it's worth answering — but perhaps remind them that the big-picture items need to be in order first. \n\nExercise, particularly cardiovascular health, is one of the biggest tools we have for health and longevity. Sleep is vital for mental and physical performance, and ties into our ability to perform everything from everyday tasks all the way up to learning the most complex things we will ever approach. Eating well underpins our ability to sleep well, to exercise, to understand and process things in the world around us, and as those nutrients literally make up our physical composition, have a long-term impact on how we live and when we will die. And finally, we find ourselves in a world of abundance, in which a variety of things are now available as addictive behaviors in a different way than was ever the case before: phones, Reddit, games, television & movies — so many things provide a \"bottomless bowl\" of dopamine that will reduce our satisfaction and ability to perform in our day-to-day lives. \n\nFocus on each of these factors, ground discussions in each of these factors, and both our lives and the health of this subreddit will increase.\n\n**What's missing?** Now, this list may well not be exhaustive, and there may be other cornerstone behaviors and practices that are directly relevant. Please let me know what they are, and I will include them here.\n\nI hope this is helpful, and is at least food for thought. I fear that, because it's a higher effort post than some shitpost about sunrise or memeing Huberdaddy, that it's going to go unnoticed. If that's the case, I suppose that's an indication about how folks here really are missing the forest for the trees. I hope not.\n\n# Addendum: Community Contributions\n\n**Social Relationships**\n\nAs /u/The_GrimTrigger pointed out, another component to keep in mind is social relationships, and Huberman has spoken about those as well. A few points that come to mind for me, though I'm happy if others have other data points from Huberman podcasts they would like to share:\n\n* Why do social connections matter? Aside from the satisfaction of it, the data points to social connection —certain types in particular— help reduce long-term stress. ([Tools for Managing Stress & Anxiety @ 01:06:47](https://youtu.be/ntfcfJ28eiU?t=4007))\n* What are dangers of not having adequate social connection? Isolation often leads to elevated stress hormones and there is data pointing to it having a long-term negative impact on systems like the immune system. ([Science of Social Bonding in Family, Friendship & Romantic Love @ 00:11:10](https://youtu.be/RgAcOqVRfYA?t=670))\n* Final note: I recall that Huberman spoke at some point about how social interactions are almost more important these days, what with all the \"proxies\" for social engagement we have. If someone finds the timestamp, that would be very helpful.\n\n## Comment ID jepfvmw with +125 score by [(The_GrimTrigger, Reddit, 2023-04-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HubermanLab/comments/129uavk/mastery_of_the_basics/jepfvmw/) (in reply to ID 129uavk):\nOutstanding, timely post.

Rather, he is a scientist looking for health signals & outcomes tied to a variety of behavior. This messaging is positively biased towards action when there are positive outcomes that have been observed, and that's what's going on here:\n\nDr. Huberman and others have observed (or identified studies observing) positive health outcomes for social behavior, and that's being referenced. There being \"better\" reasons to pursue relationships —which, again, I'm absolutely in favor of— is outside the purview of someone who is effectively a highly qualified reviewer of studies and evidence available.\n\n#### Comment ID jmsdz33 with +3 score by [(Idysseus, Reddit, 2023-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HubermanLab/comments/129uavk/mastery_of_the_basics/jmsdz33/) (in reply to ID jeuqyk1):\nIsn't this a \"both/and\" situation?

In a world where everything is trying to get your attention and distracting you from your emotions and thoughts.\n\nA meditation/relaxation practice is really important. Learning how to dissolve tension and calm your mind has such huge benefits.\n\nUnfortunately people still seem to think of Netflix as relaxation.

You need muscle mass. It's so hard to put on as a woman (after newbie gains, it's a few solid pounds a year), and muscle loss is a HUGE contributor to loss of quality of life. Not to mention accidents, metabolism decline, and loss in bone density. You can have great arteries and heart, but if you lose your balance and fall, or can't lift 25lb over your head when you're 60, your quality of life will diminish.\n\nThat's just the extreme end of the spectrum. As you get into your 30s, 40s, and 50s, you need your back to be in good working condition. That's glute strength, core strength. It's strength keeping your back supported. All the flexibility or cardio in the world won't keep your back healthy. And once your back goes... kiss all your other activities goodbye. \n\nYou don't need to lift WEIGHTS per se, but you need muscle-building, strength exercise. \n\nThere are plenty of great things highlighted above but that's just what I'm hitting.

I'm terrified of getting old and being/feeling helpless because I didn't focus on functional fitness when I was relatively young. I'm going to lift as long as I possibly can. I watched my grandmother go from 100% active in her late 80's to bedbound because of a bad hip in her early to mid-90's and I'm not doing that to myself. My family members have the tendency to live past 100, I'm not taking any chances. \n\nI've always exercised but it's been off and on due to chronic illness. I've gotten my pain and other symptoms largely under control this year, started losing weight due to Wegovy, and laser focused in on lifting, nutrition, and improving my overall fitness. I have a bad hip and I've gotten my function up to a point where it only occasionally aches.

This bears out with what I've witnessed in the older women in my life. The ones who are able to do daily planks and squats are in general more mobile, and those who can't lift themselves out of a chair are...obviously not. So I try to do body weight exercises every day, if I'm not just heaving myself around as a matter of course. Having a garden is great for that.

As women age hormonal changes make us lose muscle easily and it’s harder to put back on. Over time this has an effect on our hormonal balance, our bone density and it also is a main cause of the slowing of our metabolism. A lot of women get overly focused on cardio for weight loss, but running really messes you up over time, it wears out all of your joints. Cardiovascular health *is* important but maintaining muscle mass is imperative. If you want cardio, focus on something low impact that also builds strength (swimming is the best in my opinion. Bike riding and hiking are good too.) get out in nature, it positively effects your blood pressure and stress levels, which in turn will keep your weight down and your heart healthy (stress has a lot of systemic consequences including weight gain). \n\nNutrition: throw out diet culture. Eat balanced, regular meals. Balanced means a protein a fat a carb and a fruit/vegetable. That is a meal. Try to eat at least three of those a day, more if you are still hungry. Emphasize protein to keep your muscle up. If you want dessert, eat it. Let go of food rules and focus on nourishment instead of deprivation. \n\nBest long term exercise for supporting these goals in my opinion: swimming, bike riding, yoga (unless you are hyper-mobile) pilates, weight lifting, dance (GREAT for your long term cognitive health), aerial acrobatics (I do pole dancing, HELLO upper body and core strength!), WALKING IS SO UNDERRATED, hiking, cross country skiing, snow shoeing I’m sure I can come up with more but really, find something relatively low impact that you genuinely enjoy doing, that’s the key. Consistency will win out against perfection every day of the week. It’s about building small habits and stacking them up over time.\n\n## Comment ID jlts7mb with +51 score by [(OnehappyOwl44, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlts7mb/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI have never restricted my diet in anyway.

There are no tricks to it. When I have the opportunity, I make sure to get movement in whether it’s walking or lifting weights. I don’t restrict my eating (but also am mindful of calories taken in…I just am not counting calories) and try to focus on getting healthy fats, protein, and carbs each day. I also value cooking and flavor and really just appreciate food. I’m currently pregnant for the first time and my body has definitely changed a lot through the process so far (which has been tough to be honest) but I still follow the same principles (as much as I can - which is definitely less than before pregnancy) but I plan to adhere to the same approach post-partum.  \n\nBiggest thing I can say is that WE are in charge of our health and can absolutely maintain and even optimize health and fitness in our 30s and beyond. But it requires intention and investment and the belief that, hey, my body is capable of fitness regardless of age and that is reason enough to continue to invest in it.\n\n## Comment ID jltvyot with +44 score by [(FixPuzzleheaded577, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltvyot/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nDon’t have a baby and ppd.\n\n### Comment ID jlu0uzx with +19 score by [(Cat_With_The_Fur, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlu0uzx/) (in reply to ID jltvyot):\nFor real.

Love. It. And I definitely go through phases where I will eat more of it and of lesser quality than I should allow. \n\nBut I get back on track to healthy eating after a couple of weeks because that is what my body is used to, and I feel better doing it. My food habits include eating boiled eggs, roast chicken, baked fish, good quality canned tuna, lots of salad, sautéed spinach and other veg, low glycemic index fruit like blueberries, and some almonds. Whole wheat pasta, some lentils, too. I wash and cut up veg like broccoli and store it in a paper towel lined Pyrex dish in the fridge so it's grab and go. I'll bake a batch of chicken breast or thighs (skin off) and freeze on wax paper so it's easy to heat up when I need it. \n\nI walk a lot. I try to do 3.5 miles 3 to 5 times a week. I need to be lifting weights, and yoga makes me feel great when I do it. I like Bree and Flo short yoga classes (15-30 minutes) on YouTube. \n\nIMO, if habits are broken in then you're on autopilot and your body will gravitate to what it \"thinks\" it should be doing. This is for good and bad habits, so I reinforce the good habits.\n\n## Comment ID jltoufe with +25 score by [(Explodingovary, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltoufe/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI just do portion control and trying to make healthier choices 70-80% of the time.

You don't need to go fully vegan/plant-based to have a solid diet and healthy weight, but it was something that became easy for me pretty quickly, and then it stuck for a variety of reasons. You can do a vegan diet and be unhealthy, true, but in general, it supports good health. Whatever works for you, get your diet sorted out to something you can sustain. \"Eat food, mostly plants, not too much\" is good advice and a good target. \n\nThen just keep moving. I rotate through hobbies and could never stick with a gym membership, but I just keep finding something to do. For some seasons of my life, that was climbing and yoga. In others, skiing and mountain biking. Another, road biking and weight lifting. Currently, hiking and paddle boarding/kayaking. Even just a solid hour-long evening walk or living room YT yoga session will serve you well. Strength training is important as you age too, but if it's between long evening walks and nothing, then go get that cardio in.\n\nSeparate from going vegan, I had to quit drinking when I realized it was a migraine trigger. I don't think being 100% sober forever is the only way to be healthy, but if you're in the habit of drinking regularly, it's probably a good idea to set it down and fix the 'habit' part. Alcohol really is poison (delicious poison, but poison nonetheless), and there are plenty of ways to supplant whatever health benefits they're trying to sell for it (antioxidants, etc). \n\nWhat motivates me is watching older people who pay little to no attention to their health act like health and mobility are completely out of our control and then endlessly complain as their health declines (kind of like the people who say things like \"you can't plan or really ever be 'ready' for kids lololol\" as if birth control and financial planning are things that do not exist). I also live in a place where you do see a lot of older people out hiking and biking - it's definitely possible to enjoy an active life in your later years, but it doesn't happen by accident. Not even *trying* to stay active and healthy is a sure ticket to pain and lower quality of life, so just keep getting back on the horse, no matter where you fell off. \n\nYou don't really get to choose your health problems, but you can choose how well you take care of yourself in spite of whatever challenges you face. Lots of people would hear \"vegan and no alcohol\" and assume it's no fun and a constant bummer, but it's really nice feeling healthy and not being hungover like, ever. And I'm a good cook, so being vegan doesn't rob me anything on that side of things. My quality of life is higher because of it, not lower.\n\n### Comment ID jlu5t5o with +3 score by [(plutonianbitch, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlu5t5o/) (in reply to ID jlts6qh):\nYes to all of this 💗\n\n## Comment ID jltqns2 with +117 score by [(freshie4o9, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltqns2/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nGenetics.

I've been fighting my genes for decades and it's so frustrating because a lot of people refuse to accept that it's just a lot harder for some of us. I've never ever been effortlessly slender.

I have a much lower bodyfat than my friend who is a personal trainer and works out daily (more often than me) and I suspect the heavy compound movements and walking 1-1.5 hours a day are the difference.\n\n## Comment ID jlu6x9a with +3 score by [(jay-quellyn, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlu6x9a/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nThe best approach is no single action. Find what makes you feel happy and works do you. You cannot do it all at once, perfectly 100% of the the time. Be gentle with yourself. Don’t compare yourself to others. Don’t deprive yourself of foods you love, but think of adding in more healthy foods. I love fried chicken, but if I’m going to have it, I’ll have a salad or vegetable on the side. Try to move every day, but not every workout needs to be intense. Walking on off days can be a very good friend, and it gets you outside where you can calm your mind and focus on your surroundings. Sleep. Cutting back on alcohol has also worked really well for me. It’s all about incremental progress and sustainable habits. I’m feeling more motivated and stronger now at 36 than I did at 26. Looking forward to what my 40s can bring.\n\nEdit: Adding that it is hard to outwork a bad diet/high caloric intake with exercise. I took my overweight dog to the vet a few years ago, and he said, “It all starts at the food bowl.” I think about this all the time for myself.\n\n## Comment ID jluli0u with +3 score by [(wholeselfin, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jluli0u/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nFor me, 2 things helped:\n1.  Running.  I was lucky that this has been my exercise of choice, because it’s so much easier to motivate for and fit into a busy schedule and holes in the day than things that require going to a gym, wearing special clothes and equipment, meeting up with a partner or team.  You can really just put on your shoes and go. In a pinch, I’ve run in jeans and dresses. It’s available 24/7, from 30-95 degrees with proper adaptations (some people run much colder than this but I’m a cold weather wimp).  I keep a gym bag in my car and run during my kids’ activities.  I also have a big dog and run confidently with her after dark. \n2.  Having kids and keeping up with them.  When you go to the playground, don’t just sit and watch and catch up on your phone.  I am 50, my youngest is 9, and we do cartwheels, monkey bars, play basketball, I try to skateboard but that’s one thing I can’t keep up with.  Never stop playing, and celebrate when they get stronger and faster than you.\n\n## Comment ID jluqkt5 with +4 score by [(musictakeheraway, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jluqkt5/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nthe best approach is to find a lifestyle that is sustainable and works for you!! i am 33 and the most fit i have ever been in my life because i started pole dancing at 29 and it’s a very involved hobby and requires a lot of training and commitment and consistency.\n\n\n\ni don’t think of it as working out, but i am the strongest and most muscular and in shape i have ever been. it’s my hobby and it’s a form of expression and artistry and it’s an important community i have built and it’s a coping skill and it’s fun and it’s a way to invest in myself.\n\n\n\ni am also a lacto ovo vegetarian, but have been one since childhood for ethical reasons. you just have to find out what works for you and interests you and doesn’t feel like a chore or requirement, but are things that align with who you are and things you want to show up to and be part of and stick with!\n\n## Comment ID jluuler with +3 score by [(GrandmaCereal, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jluuler/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nMy biggest tips:\n\nFind activity that *you* enjoy. For me it's triathlons. For someone else, it's barre class or yoga. Whatever keeps your body moving will 100% benefit you in the long run.\n\n\nStart incorporating weight lifting into your routine. You will NOT get bulky. You will build skeletol muscle that will help your body maintain its mobility and bone density as you age.\n\n\nSomeone else mentioned mobility. Keep up your stretching. Take care of your injuries. Do your physical therapy. Not only will these help you heal up faster if you do get injured, but they will help prevent further injury in the first place.\n\n\nAs for nutrition: 80/20. I eat healthy 80% of the time. The other 20% for me means pizza and a beer every single Friday, and 2 Dove chocolates after lunch and dinner. Do I have some unfortunate body fat? Yes. Is it biologically necessary for me as a woman to have body fat in the areas it's in? Also, yes.\n\n\nJust remember to keep thinking big picture. Everything you do for yourself today, think of yourself at 90. You're doing this for you 90s body.\n\n## Comment ID jlvwkbd with +4 score by [(awakened97, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlvwkbd/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nIt’s important to understand that the body changing with age isn’t simply solely because of age. It’s just that around 30, you begin to visibly see the ramifications of your lifestyle. Depending on your lifestyle—the rate of the body aging, weight gain, cognitive decline, all of it is significantly impacted. This should hopefully be empowering because it means we have more control over our personal health and fitness with age than is let on in the states.\n\nI first focused on my blood sugar regulation, as blood sugar spikes can cause gradual metabolic damage, inflammation and thus aging, and slowing the metabolism over time. This results in that stubborn fat that won’t move. Living a sedentary life (like sitting at a desk all day then sitting on the couch all night) also slows our metabolism, and this lowers our energy and efficiency with burning fat.\n\nHere in the states we’re led to believe caring about the blood sugar is only for people worried about diabetes.\n\nAll of this to say—regular walks, leading my meals with protein & fiber before my sweet treats (to prevent blood sugar spikes without restricting), eating fresh raw fruits& veggies when possible, and 3x/week cardio made a HUGE difference in my life.\n\n## Comment ID jltlhl2 with +13 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltlhl2/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nUhh...

Even when I travel I try to pack snacks instead of eating at the airport or on the road. 95% of the food I cook doesn’t come out of a box. I’m not cooking full, organic, fresh meals that have been kissed by the sun god or anything. Just pasta with carrots or fajitas or whatever. \nWhen I want a cookie, I eat a cookie. But I actively buy foods without added sugar. I also don’t eat if I’m not hungry and don’t feel bad if I overeat due to hormones. Which means the days before my period I’ll eat anything not still breathing. The days after, I could live off a yogurt and a handful of cashews. Also, I drink water with lemon and black coffee and never soda or sugary drinks. (And booze because of course)\n\nAs for working out, I work out so I can do the things I enjoy when I can actually do them. I love to hike and backpack, so I need to stay in shape year round so that when the time comes, I’m not struggling. I actually enjoy manual labor like working in the yard and shoveling snow so I lean into those when I can (who wants to move garden rocks with me this weekend!). I also walk whenever I can. Like, actually walk to the store or the bar or my friends houses if I can make it in a reasonable amount of time. When I worked in an office I always too the stairs, even when I worked on the 20th floor. \nI care more about my health than my looks. When I worked in an office I’d go to the gym for lunch and do a quick washcloth bath afterwards, never a full shower. I kept my hair simple and my makeup light because my lunch hour was too short to get in a good work out AND look pretty afterwards. \n\nI don’t workout as much as I did when I was younger but my goals have changed so that’s ok. But I just turned 40 and I can still do a couple of pushups and jog a mile without really trying.\n\n## Comment ID jltw23p with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltw23p/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nChoose activities you actually enjoy and would look forward to doing.

You must learn to be disciplined because you will not always be motivated. Consistency doesn’t mean perfection, but that you get it right most of the time. \n\nWeight training is important for women as we age because it, along with other factors helps prevent osteoporosis and other age-related issues. It will help you recover faster from injuries as well as help prevent them - of course as long as you use proper form and don’t lift too heavy of weights before you have built the strength to do so. \n\n Genetics plays a big role in how you age and what your body looks like, however eating a healthy diet of lean protein, veggies, carbs, and fats will give whatever genetics you have a boost. I know I will never have skinny legs, it’s just not in my genetics. If fat bottom girls make the rockin’ world go ‘round, my family is doing their part. I try not to beat myself up about it, which I will admit is sometimes really hard.  \n\nI cycle through periods of calorie restriction (fat loss) and maintenance, where I get to enjoy foods I love that aren’t healthy (but are good for the soul) - you can’t and shouldn’t live your life on a “diet” or in a state of calorie restriction for many reasons (quality of life, metabolic adaptation, etc.)  \n\nI leave room in my life for the good-for-the-soul foods most of the year, and restrict my calories for a short time when I feel I need to. I have been generally  able to keep visible abs year round without killing myself (again see my comment about genetics! And that wasn’t always the case!) I found an diet and exercise program that works for me (Renaissance Periodization). I lift weights and do some amount of cardio 5-6 days per week. I genuinely love lifting, I love how it has transformed my body and I love how strong I am. Lifting gives me a sense of accomplishment and makes me feel powerful. But I also know that not everyone loves lifting and that is totally ok.

So making sure you eat the right quantity for you in some form is key, whether that's keto, intermittent fasting, or just having a handle on your overall intake. Other than that,  focusing on building muscle through strength training also helps metabolism (and motivation because you'll feel strong). Protein intake helps build muscle so that's important too. And staying active with walking or other activity outside the gym.\n\nFor me the biggest motivator is finding a way to strength train that always has me chasing a little more - a new skill, a new PR, or even just moving the same weight but better. I work with a coach right now who programs for me in a way I like but there are tons of good online programs too. That chase keeps me really consistent because I like the feeling of always having something to work towards.\n\n## Comment ID jltu7st with +2 score by [(sittinginthesunshine, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltu7st/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI always stayed active by walking, but I truly got fit after 40!

It's absolutely not. I was a chubby child through my early teens. It took a concerted effort for me to lose weight in high school, which I did by walking and jogging a lot. It takes discipline and consistency for me to not regain weight.\n\nThe physique I have now is due to a combination of intense workouts and a great diet, but it' mostly my diet. I'm able to maintain my lean frame (just not my biceps) through just walking a lot (I have dogs) and eating intentionally.\n\nI intermittent fast (loosely) and do cardio at 6am on an empty stomach. I eat a green smoothie for lunch practically every day of my life unless I'm traveling. Then, I limit snacking in between meals. I'll have a *planned* snack or two in between lunch and dinner but I never graze. Dinner is a salad with lean protein several days per week, some type of burger (turkey/salmon/impossible, rarely beef) with salad or roasted veggies once or twice, then pasta or pizza with salad/roasted veggies the other days. This is the carb/calorie cycling method where I eat at maintenance or slightly under it based on my TDEE (google it) and then spike my carbs and calories a few days a week to refuel and stabilize hunger hormones, facilitate muscle growth and repair.\n\nYou have to care about and enjoy this stuff, however. I like being active, I find healthy food delicious, and I also like to eat huge portions, so intermittent fasting lets me do this without gaining weight. There's something to be said for finding what works for you, but as another commenter said, knowing your energy needs (i.e. how many calories and what nutrients your body requires to function) and meeting these, plus being physically active go a long way to keeping a person fit as they age. You just have to make it a priority which many people cannot or won't do, especially women. This goes double for moms, so it's worthwhile for me to acknowledge that I don't have kids and my body has never undergone pregnancy or childbirth.\n\n## Comment ID jluhpu0 with +2 score by [(Eva_De_Peva, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jluhpu0/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nFor me it has been playing capoeira, taking daily 30 minute lunch walks, and bikepacking.

Whether that's yoga, rebounding, walking, lifting etc. you will have a baseline no matter what. \n\nAnd then eliminating foods that don't serve you for more healthful whole options.

The goal is to naturally transition into a whole foods way of eating such that it isn't a \"diet\". \n\nWalk 10,000+ steps a day most days. A 45 minute to one hour walk is about 10,000 steps for me. \n\nStay active throughout the day. Set a timer on your phone to walk around the office, do squats and calf lifts, or whatever you can and feel comfortable doing every half hour to an hour. Do NOT sit in a chair for 4+ hours straight. \n\nTake up some active hobbies that you can do after work and/or on weekends. Bouldering, cycling, hiking, running etc have relatively low barriers to entry and are more fun (to me) than the gym.

I like to learn \"comfort meals\" from all the different types of cuisines and make them at home with lots of love and high quality ingredients. \n\nI am motivated primarily by the fact that my entire family are all extremely unhealthy and succumb to illnesses, passing way too young. My cousin cannot walk because she's done damage to her back and can't do the physio to recover. My uncle died this year from stage 4 liver cancer, which I think is probably due to crash dieting and never addressing binge eating patterns. \n\nI also find being active is good for my mental health, and I do stuff I find fun like mountain biking, sword fighting and other types of \"stunt\" work.

I do both Orangetheory (it’s my social time after working from home) and walks/runs (I love being outside). My dog is 15 and she still goes on walks every day and looks half her age and still gets puppy energy. I hope my body feels younger as I age just by moving it. \n\nFor nutrition, it’s also remembering how crappy I feel when I consistently don’t eat well. I’m a big believer in being able to eat what you want as long as you don’t eat too large of portions and having a variety of food. That’s when I feel my best. I’m an over eater by nature so I go through waves of it but I go crazy if I put huge limitations on myself. And weighing/measuring my food stresses me out. This works for a lot of people but not me. So again, finding what works for you. \n\nWhat motivates me is remembering how tired and lazy I felt before starting OT and I don’t want to feel that way again. Starting my day with a walk energizes me for the day and doing OT after work gives me an outlet for my stress. And start small. No need to make yourself start working out five days a week.

That's when your habits start to catch up to you and the impact of your lifestyle really makes itself felt.\n\nFor cred: I'm 43 and while I no longer run marathons or do triathlons, I still hike, mountain bike, do yoga and lift weights.

When I was a teen and until early 20s I would eat what were normal portions to me. I was gaining weight slowly but constantly...note that the portions were not so big. Then when I was 22 something happened in my life and I spent days not eating because I was depressed. When the appetite came back, I would eat much smaller portions than previously. I have been in control of my weight since then. I do not actively control the portions, but I am way more attentive to the signals my body sends me. Turns out I need small meals but I also eat a lot of snacks in-between meals because I'm hungry. I just listen to my body. And I eat chips, chocolate, etc, but in small quantities.

I am mostly fit. I pretty much think it was being really athletic as a kid, taking dance classes, (still occasionally do), horseback riding (I still do that every week), sports and being outside running around all of the time. Just all around staying physically active. I have goats and chickens, so I regularly jump over fences, haul hay and 50lb sacks of feed around. When I walk, I walk fast. I stretch to keep my joints limber.\n\nAs for diet, I eat whatever I feel like eating whenever I feel like it, but compared to my friends, I seem to eat a lot less than they do...... but then, I also weigh a lot less. Interestingly, they all think they eat way less than I see that they actually do eat. I eat full fat, and sugar. No caffeine, not much alcohol. I never eat food with the words, \"low fat\", \"fat free\", \"diet\" or \"keto\" on them. I do eat fresh food that I make from scratch, and almost nothing processed. Never have. Fast food? Pretty much never. Breakfast is a no. I eat one large meal a day and snack on fruit or whatever....I graze. Big meal always has veg and whatever else I feel like.\n\nI am around 8lbs heavier than I'd like to be, (right now I am 5'2\" and 112lbs on a very small frame), but I'm too lazy to diet. You lose muscle as you get older and gain a tummy pretty much no matter how fit you are, but you also get more complacent about how you look as long as you feel good and are mostly healthy.\n\n## Comment ID jlu9t5s with +1 score by [(ZedZemM, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlu9t5s/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI gained some weight that stick since I turned 30.

Lol I jest but I really think one of the main reasons I've been able to stay fit and not put on a lot of weight is I don't have kids. I haven't had to go through the physical rollercoaster of pregnancy and childbirth and have limited free time because I was caring for my children. Not saying you can't stay fit as a parent: it's just harder for a lot of people because you have a lot less free time and energy. \n\nNow on a more serious note \n\n1) lots of cooking and meal prepping. I spend a LOT of time in the kitchen \n\n2) Weight lifting. I've found this is the most helpful for me. I love packing on the muscle and getting gains. \n\n3) Keeping temptation food out of the house. I have no willpower. If there is a bag of potato chips or box of cereal, it will be gone in 30 hours\n\n4) Find exercise you love. I love being fit and moving. But I really don't like YouTube workout videos or cardio that much. So currently I do a lot of biking, swimming, and weight lifting. And I recently started a bungee fitness class. \n\n5) Make it a habit and I swear that as time goes past, that habit will be so engrained you can't not do it. \n\nWhat motivates me is seeing older adults with limited mobility and not wanting to be that way down the road.

Nothing has changed my body like lifting weights. I use Apple Fitness+ at home with a mix of 10/15/20 lb weights - I don't even go to the gym. My Apple Watch records an average of 45 min of exercise 7 days a week.\n\nFood was a bigger challenge for me. I used to avoid planning meals and would just wing it at the grocery store. I also was very into using the Magnolia Cookbooks and any random recipe I found on Pinterest. Have you ever looked up a recipe out of desperation because you have two ingredients? Yeah, the solution is always to add pasta and cream cheese. I found the \"Skinny Taste\" cookbooks and website and everything changed.

The bastards were right when they say activity, water, and clean eating makes you happy. Dammit. But in all honesty, it’s seeing the small changes and feeling like I have more energy. You are way more capable than you give your body credit for and it’s awesome. Half the battle is mental. Psyching yourself out saying “I’ll never be a runner” or “I could ever do that it’s not who I am” literally you’d be surprised. The important thing is take it baby step by baby step, don’t kill yourself every time bc you might feel accomplished after that one work out but getting yourself to go back when you think it’s going to be brutal is harder. Slow build. Be patient. \n\nAlso I’ve seen two grandparents age: 1 was fit (fit means a lot to a lot of ppl, find fit for you) and the other was healthy enough but didn’t stay active or fit.

These days I do a lot of step-based workouts like incline walking and regular outdoor hikes.  I am a huge believer in walking - people do not walk nearly enough, in my opinion.\n\nBut as a regular form of cardio, cycling just ticks off every box for me:  it gets you outside, it’s a fun way to explore the world (even if it’s “just” your local town), it feels like being a kid, and it burns a ton of calories.  There is a big sense of accomplishment in finishing a ride.  I hope to find a way to do it again.\n\nI also strength train.  I had to stop training for some time.  But the good thing about strength, is that if you ever got really strong once, it becomes easier to get it back.\n\nIn my 20’s, it took me months to be able to pick up certain weights.

I bike, I run, I dance, I boxe, I do yoga, I do weight lifting… as long as I am moving my most at least 30 min a day…\n\nWith diet, due to my conditions I need to be low carb anti inflammatory low gi… I eat real food, cook at home most of the time, from scratch, and eat tons of vegetables. I don’t drink sweets, I limit my alcohol, don’t use drugs, and limit my caffeine as well. I don’t have a issue with binge eating, but sometimes I do eat out of my diet, and when I do I just move on the next day and go back to my normal life..\n\nI drink a lot of water, I sleep 8h a day and respect my circadian rhythm.. i used to think I was a night owl in my 20s, but I was just lying to myself, I was always tired… sleeping at night, waking up in the morning really changed my life… \n\nI do a medical checkup yearly, do ny blood work, adjust my supplements according to my needs… and if needed my diet as well…\n\n## Comment ID jlujuc1 with +1 score by [(CanaryMine, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlujuc1/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nFind something you actually enjoy and look forward to. Work that into your routine and just keep doing it a few times a week.  For me that is cycling, walking my dog, gardening and yoga. In the winter I do more yoga and indoor cycling. Those are all hobbies/things I have to do/ exercise and it’s very easy to keep up with it. I also used to do CrossFit and liked it but couldn’t handle the injuries. Eat sweets and fried things in moderation and drink in moderation. If you keep healthy habits regular and routine it is easier than heroic efforts now and then.\n\n## Comment ID jlujwna with +1 score by [(SabineLavine, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlujwna/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nConsistent dedication to working out and eating within my maintenance range.

Incorporate some sort of weight bearing exercises to maintain bone density and raise your BMR. You don’t need to obsessively track calories but when food shopping or planning your meals for the week, start by selecting your proteins and try to meet your daily goal. Next you should think of good sources of fats and finally I find that carbs are in anything and everything and are mostly unavoidable so I don’t plan for them. \n\nIf that’s a lot to think of try to shop the perimeter of the grocery store or try to eat things that you can “look at and tell what it is” e.g. chicken breast, vegetables, rice, whole grains. And not packaged or overly processed foods where you can’t tell what’s in it.\n\n## Comment ID jlunpsz with +1 score by [(Abcd_e_fu, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlunpsz/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nWalk. 30 minutes minimum every day, a decent pace.

When I hit menopause in my late forties, I kinda fell into a funk and stopped everything and it showed. What works for me now:\n\nDiet:  I eat one big meal a day, usually lunch, and it's much easier for me than trying to eat a lot of little meals.  I don't really count calories but I go heavy on protein and fat, light on carbs, and try to always include something green.  \n\nI try to let myself get actually hungry before I eat, not starving, just hungry instead of munchy.  I find if I'm never hungry, I'm gaining weight.  If I get a little hungry in the evening, I'll have something small like pistachios or a cheese stick.\n\nExercise:  It's easier if you can find something social you enjoy.  I'm on a competitive rowing team, we train together and go to regattas.  If I don't feel like working out, I still do because my crew is counting on me.\n\nI started doing yoga online a couple of years ago and it's been great.  I do at least 30 min every evening, it's a great way to relax for bed and has really firmed up my arms.\n\nAlcohol:  I quit drinking entirely and my weight has dropped to it's lowest in my adult life (I was never all that overweight but maybe a bit chubby).  I also feel great all the time.  I hadn't intended to quit but the effects have been so good, I'm never going back.\n\n## Comment ID jluqou2 with +1 score by [(Faeriecrypt, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jluqou2/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI started exercising regularly when I turned 30, and I feel a lot better overall. \n\nM-F, I wake up at 5 and do a mix of Walk at Home and Fit by Mik in the living room for about an hour.

I dunno. Being healthy? Let me tell you what I do! I'm in my early 50s and I think I'm in good shape, at least as good as I was in my 20s, even though I'm a bit heavier now (5' 4.5\", hovering around 145 pounds, whereas at age 30 I was about 10 pounds lighter). My weight has been pretty stable since having kids, but I do occasionally diet to knock a few pounds off (5-10, which I can do in a month or two, then go back to normal).\n\nI've always walked a few miles most days. For a while in my 20s and 30s I did martial arts, which I enjoyed and was good for me socially. I did lose some fitness when my kids were young because of disrupted sleep and the stress of living with young kids and a man-child. A couple of years ago I took up running and now I run about 20 miles/week, which is great for my mental health as well as whatever it does physically. \n\nI do prioritize sleep -- I go to bed early-ish and wake up pretty early, too. I'm starting to prioritize eating more protein, but I don't have a very restrictive diet. On days when I don't do a long run, I generally stick to 3 meals/day and no significant snacks. I also cook, so most of my diet comes from \"real\" ingredients, rather than packaged convenience foods... but my kids (and my ex) like them so I'm not a purist. I ran a trail half marathon this morning and I just ate half a pint of Ben & Jerrys because I wanted it. \n\nBut yeah, stay active, do things you enjoy, sleep enough, and eat well.\n\nAlso I've cut way back on alcohol and avoiding alcohol makes a huge difference, too.\n\n## Comment ID jluuujc with +1 score by [(PeachyKeenest, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jluuujc/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nEating right - I got a nutritionist after awhile and proteins are the way to go.

For example, I have a friend that lost a ton of weight by becoming a marathon runner, she's competitive, so her main motivation was to keep running so she could do better in races. That worked for her, while I, someone who isn't competitive but is more goal oriented, just set weekly fitness goals. Stuff like go to the gym at least 3 times this week. \n\nConsidering how I get a hit of dopamine by accomplishing weekly goals, and how my friend gets a hit of dopamine when her run is a little bit faster, the secret to finding a healthy lifestyle that works for you is figuring out what healthy activities and habits release dopamine in your brain. The reason this is important because dopamine also motivates us to take action, its not only the reward.\n\nSo if the investment in our health is something that genuinely makes us happy, it is easier to be motivated to maintain that investment. At first it will be hard, because your brain may be more motivated to do unhealthy things, and it will take some experimentation to find an activity or diet that you enjoy. However once you figure out what works for you and you start sticking to it consistently, maintaining a healthy lifestyle gets easier and easier.  \n\n\nI like to say eating healthy and working out isn't hard.

I packed on weight, had blood sugar issues and skin tags on my neck that were indicating pre diabetes, and I was suffering from lots of reflux, aches pains and inflammation. It got to the point where some days the inflammation was so bad I could barely walk, and nearly everything I ate or drank would result in days of reflux/heartburn - so I had to make big change. At first I went to the doctor and they put me on anti inflammatory meds which helped with inflammation, but made the reflux worse and I started to develop a stomach ulcer. I got cranky about taking drugs that made things worse, went on a research frenzy, and decided to address it myself with diet and exercise. My whole body has changed in the last eight months. I started on a vegan diet, but not strictly, about 70-80% of the time. I find if it’s too strict I get annoyed and abandon it, so now my motto is being good most of the time. This helped reduce the inflammation. I would say I experienced about 80% reduction in pain and inflammation within days of going vegan. I stopped drinking alcohol too, and stuck to a vegan diet for about 3 months. It helped get me to the point where I could start thinking about exercise bc before that I was in so much pain it would not have been possible. After a while on vegan diet I noticed that I was overeating and the blood sugar issues were not improving. I was ravenous and always prowling in the kitchen, so I decided to go mostly keto as it’s as clear I was still on a blood sugar spike and drop cycle. I started drinking a Yerba mate supplement in the mornings to help manage blood sugar and suppress cravings and it made a huge difference. I now usually don’t eat breakfast, I have a Yerba mate and have my first keto meal at midday, and my dinner - also keto - at around 5pm. After being on keto 70-80% of the time for a month I was losing so much weight that I had to increase my calories bc I was getting stretch marks (I hadn’t had any since I was a teen and I forgot how much they hurt!). So if I am out of my house now I eat whatever I like and drink alcohol, but at home it’s keto only. Weight loss wasn’t the goal but since going mostly keto I’ve dropped close to 14kg. When I went keto I also started doing reformer Pilates twice a week, and I try to walk more. Pilates has made a world of difference, I feel so strong and I stand taller. I realised I don’t like pointless walking, so I make sure to book social events where I have enough time to walk into the city after work (about 40min - an hour once or twice a week). It feels like I can maintain this forever and continue to add new good habits to this baseline I’ve created. I’m still losing weight but much more slowly, and I don’t feel deprived. I wish I had started this younger. There’s so much advice and many opinions on what you should do - it’s confusing. I had to try a few things and see what worked for me bc we are all a little different. I have ADHD which means that unless I love something or it’s purposeful (exercise) I won’t stick with it, and ordering pre-cooked keto meals saves me time money and food waste. I would have loved to stay vegan morally, but I just couldn’t make it work for my body long term and I’m glad I listened to my body.\n\n## Comment ID jlvusmv with +1 score by [(MongooseInCharmeuse, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlvusmv/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nWeight lifting & rucking (walking increasing distances while increasing weight).

On days I'm not tired I lift weights or jog. On days I'm tired I just play some fitness or dance game on switch and call it a day. I wear a smart watch to keep track of it. I think strength training is important and some women avoid it to avoid turning into the hulk. Let me tell you that's close to impossible. I've worked out for years and focusing on strength these past few months and I'm still tiny. Gaining muscle is harder than you think and you won't accidentally turn into the hulk.\n\nI don't cook my own meals so I don't get much choice. I just cut out sugary drinks and alcohol.

As I got older I got tired much quicker throughout the days and it's easy to get into the mindset of 'I'll do it tomorrow' in terms of healthy eating and exercise. But I've wavered enough times to remember the feeling of being sick and unwell from a bad diet and how much less pain I'm in when I eat well and exercise. So I always make sure my mindset is clear and put lots of willpower into looking after myself. If you don't feel like you have willpower, literally sternly tell yourself out loud 'you ARE going to do it, and you ARE going to feel great after' and just propel yourself along to whatever your fitness goals are. If you tell yourself you're too tired (or can't be bothered) you effectively talk yourself into not doing it when in reality you can. Even if you fail after 2 minutes, it's better to do that than never to have tried at all. This has kept me mentally at my happiest and at my physical peak. \n\n - Also calories in Vs calories out is vital for fitness goals, exercise can be as hard or light as you want depending on what your personal goals are.\n\n## Comment ID jlvz9r7 with +1 score by [(Mor_Tearach, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlvz9r7/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nHonestly?

I know people who flourish on intermittent fasting, keto and quite restrictive diets. I can not. I realised I’m a volume eater, so I do really well on a Mediterranean diet - unlimited whole grains, legumes, fruit, veg, some dairy, fish a couple of times a week, red meat once or twice a month, some chicken but a whole lot of vegetarian days.  I lost so much weight I had to reintroduce cake, though I tried to make ones with nutritional value (fruit, nuts, various grain flours), but real sugar and butter. \n\nMeal planning and meal prepping were essential for me to stick to it, I never had to cook very much during my work week, I was allowed to snack as much as I wanted, but it had to be substantial and nutritious, so if I was emotional eating I’d get full too quickly and stop. So I kept a variety of foods to meet these snacking requirements in the house. \n\nI also worked a non-sedentary job (nursing) and took the stairs. I wasn’t OTT with working out, but I did press ups and sit ups a couple of times a week, went swimming or trail walking once or twice a week and walked around the block if I felt like I needed some activity. \n\nThen I had kids, had a whole bunch of food aversions while pregnant, have much less time and have to cook family meals and kids go too slow to get a good brisk walk in. It was good while it lasted!\n\n## Comment ID jlx5wqw with +1 score by [(iwantathestral, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlx5wqw/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nFind something active you enjoy doing!

I hate the gym. No soda/sugary drinks and I don't keep chips/candy in the house, or maybe a small bag of each.

In my early 20s I was super thin and weak. Had little strength and little endurance . I did a spartan race and realized I needed a change. \nNow I look forward to my workouts. It’s just such a part of my daily routine. \nI do a combination of strength, cardio and mobility. I go to CrossFit 3x a week which Is always varied , then I do a more traditional program 2-3x a week (this depends on how Im feeling- if I need rest, I always take it) I walk for about an hour on my lunch break when it’s nice outside. On days I don’t go to the gym I’m still usually active with some hiking or just a nice walk if I can fit it in.  Find what you enjoy and will stick to. \nI eat to fuel my workouts and feel good. Lots of protein, lots of veggies. I loosely track my macros. I decide my breakfast, lunch and dinners for the week and on Sunday I buy my groceries and meal prep for 3 days. On Wednesday night  I meal prep for 2 more. (I dont usually worry about prepping for weekends)\nDrinking lots of water. Listening to your body if it needs rest. And getting good quality sleep .  sleep is the one I struggle with most \n\nI’m only 32, but I do feel great . I have a ton more energy than a lot of my friends, no aches and pains , etc.\n\n## Comment ID jlxegt2 with +1 score by [(julie_saad_wellness, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlxegt2/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nKeto + walking + going to bed\n\n## Comment ID jlxexrf with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlxexrf/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nFor me, i got back into ice hockey at 31 and that’s basically the only exercise i do\n\n## Comment ID jlxf9dw with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlxf9dw/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI lift as heavy as possible.

Honestly, I'm in way better shape now than when I was 21- not only mentally, but slimmer and better cardio health too.\n\nI eat out like 2x a month at most. I drink alcohol a few times a year. My portion sizes have been halved pretty much and even then, the composition of meals are like 50% protein, 40% veg, maybe 5% carbs but probably less as I don't eat till I'm stuffed. My meals are big enough so that I'm not hungry but still not full. \n\nI drink a shitton of water daily (like.. at least 4L, more on weekends), walk to work/groceries (so some form of exercise on the daily).\n\nBasically the same things anyone wanting to be healthy should do, regardless of age. ☺️\n\n## Comment ID jlyqgog with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlyqgog/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI get the distinct impression that by \"looking healthy\" and \"fit\" you mean slender with good muscle definition (but not too much), no excess body fat as well as smooth skin with good elasticity. Although I understand *why* this aesthetic is associated with health, I do feel the need to widen that perspective a tad, considering that at the time in my life when I best fit that description (my late twenties) I was possibly the unhealthiest I have ever been physically and mentally. Now that I'm over thirty I am heavier, stronger, and overall healthier and happier, but maybe not in ways that translate to \"looking fit\". I achieve this by eating what I want in moderation, limiting alcohol and other toxic substances, wearing sunscreen, doing a daily yoga practice, engaging with a GOOD therapist, sleeping at night and walking absolutely everywhere I can.\n\n## Comment ID jlyx3f4 with +1 score by [(timetraveler2060, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlyx3f4/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\n1. Time restricted eating (or feeding) some people call it fasting also. I eat from 12pm until 8pm (only exception on special occasions or vacation) my weight stopped yo-yoing.\n2. Clean eating, you don’t need to follow a strict diet, but I do follow mostly paleo or keto recipes and cook at home. I’ll have gluten free pasta when I’m craving carbs. The key is not to psychologically restricted yourself from everything and allow for cheats here and there.\n3. I’m not big on cardio. But long brisk walks have been proven to be as effective and healthier on your joints. I do some mild weightlifting as your muscles and core are important to maintain as a woman especially after 30. \n4.

      "# [On offense: Proactively personalizing medicine to optimize health](https://pharmacy.osu.edu/news/offense-proactively-personalizing-medicine-optimize-health)\nLaura Lile, MD, RPh, BS Pharm ’87, a dual-credentialed physician and clinical pharmacist, is nationally sought after for her proactive approach to preventative health and wellness – primarily using genomics.\n\n“I started down this path for my own family because we have extremely high cardiovascular and stroke risk,” Dr. Lile said. “I wanted to see my mom and dad be able to live a longer life, rather than losing them at 70 years old, which was common in my family history.”\n\nDr. Lile’s career has always been in the details.\n\nAfter her mom had a heart attack at a young age, Dr. Lile began looking into epigenetics to understand what she could do to improve her mom’s health. However, she wanted to go further – asking ‘what is the root cause of the disease or condition that patients are experiencing?’\n\nNow, through her practice, Lile Wellness Partners, Dr. Lile partners with patients to provide precise and comprehensive insights into their genetic makeup through IntellxxDNA™ testing. In addition, she uses bloodwork as the primary basis for following trend analysis of patients – both healthy and unhealthy. The Lile Wellness team can then tinker with medicine and supplement regimens to attain optimal health for their patients’ individual needs.\n\n“We practice offense medicine, not defense,” Dr. Lile said. “We believe in getting to the root cause of a disease state or condition. Rather than treating the condition only, we look at what may be causing it, such as lifestyle or genetic predispositions, to optimize a patient’s health.”\n\nGenomic testing allows patients to understand their genome and then dial in to very specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to see their risk factors for certain conditions and disease states. Pharmacists and physicians can then use that information to understand how to work around those SNPs. Using the gene variants, the health care team can modify risk using targeted medicine and supplements and then monitor the patient’s response through bloodwork.\n\n“We use these reports to analyze genes that are present in very low percentages in the population, less than 5% to 10%. We question why these genes still exist in someone's gene pool while the rest of the world has evolved and gotten rid of them” Dr. Lile said. “We then take a deep dive into the research to see what those genes have a higher risk of causing. In isolation, these gene variants are helpful to know, but without the IntellxxDNA™ tool and the evidence-based recommendations that it provides, it can be scary to know you carry a high-risk gene. These clinical decision tools remove that fear because now we can decipher how to override that part of your genome.”\n\nDr. Lile says that PharmDs are the perfect health care practitioners to perform the complex work of interpreting a genomic test, due to their expertise in the usage of medicine and accessibility to patients.\n\n“To use this tool effectively, you don’t need to prescribe medicine. You are guiding patients with a clinical tool to understand their genome and the why behind disease states like diabetes or depression. You can provide them with a powerful tool that can be refreshed on a routine basis, putting the pharmacist in an excellent position to be the patient’s health care advocate. Genomic tools can expand the role of the pharmacist.”\n\nHer strong belief that pharmacists can play a vital role in this process led Dr. Lile to invite four Ohio State PharmD students to an IntellxxDNA™ conference in the summer of 2023. She felt that it was her pharmacy training – not her medical training – that enabled her to understand the extremely complex reports she receives through genetic testing.\n\nOne of the students who attended the conference, Class of 2024 PharmD candidate, Kate Pollock, has continued her work with Dr. Lile and will join the Lile Wellness team upon her graduation in May 2024 as the first full-time PharmD in the clinical practice who will see patients and complete consults, rather than filling prescriptions.\n\nEven before tools like IntellxxDNA™, Dr. Lile had been using patients’ bloodwork markers to narrow in on improving health outcomes. However, the IntellxxDNA™ report, provides an immediate roadmap to optimal health outcomes without having to guess what’s going on with only some of the information.\n\n“I’ve spent years tweaking medications and supplements in patients to ensure that I see the responses in their blood work that I expect to see. While I’ve been doing this for years, I now have a clinical decision support tool that can get patients to optimal medication support on day one because we know exactly what their body needs.”\n\nDr. Lile and Pollock both attest to the benefits that their patients are seeing through this DNA-targeted precision-based medicine approach.\n\n“It has been great to meet with patients at their follow-up visits and hear how they’ve been able to participate in things like hiking or exercise that they weren’t able to before the testing,” Pollock said. “Patients are seeing progress on their health goals faster because we are able to tailor their body’s unique needs to them.”\n\nThey both also say the key to this type of intervention being used more widely is for pharmacists to continue to advocate for the profession.\n\n“The power of this tool can exponentially expand the role of pharmacists,” Dr. Lile said. “Pharmacists understand this complex medication and supplement-related data and use it to advocate for, and partner with, our patients. We need to identify the skill sets and value that we have as pharmacists to be a part of the solution. We’ve been doing it for years – pharmacists have always been the trusted healthcare professional, especially in rural communities that routinely experience a shortage of doctors. This is a natural progression for the profession of pharmacy.”",
      "# [How to Guide Your Patients With Obesity to Optimize Health by Joanna Broder on 2025-03-13](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/how-guide-your-patients-obesity-optimize-health-2025a100062z)\nIn 2023, Tamara Hall reached a crossroads. At 5’11 and 336 pounds, she had undone all the progress she made 10 years earlier when she lost about 100 pounds through the WeightWatchers program. She had successfully maintained her weight loss for a few years, but then life got in the way. A second child, followed by her divorce, led to some of the hardest times in her life.\n\n“It was just a mess,” she said. “Financial things, you know what I mean.”\n\nThe healthy habits Hall had worked so hard to put in place eventually dissolved. Instead of healthy meals, she ate at Wendy’s and Taco Bell. She stopped working out and eventually she could not keep up with her 3-year-old daughter. The last straw was when she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. “That was enough for me to say it’s time for a change.”\n\nHall — a 45-year-old, Las Vegas-based analyst at T-Mobile — returned to WeightWatchers. Only this time it offered a new option — the chance to meet with a clinician, and if you qualified, to start on a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) medication, a class of medications that can help manage obesity and diabetes. Hall chose Mounjaro (tirzepatide).\n\nHer journey to 150 pounds of weight loss was hard, she said, but doable. If she can do this at the age of 45 years with three kids, anyone can, she said. “Don’t wait for the right time…Just press play. Just go.”\n\nHow are healthcare practitioners helping their patients who are obese in their healthy living journeys? Here’s what they said.\n\nTaking A Personalized Approach\n\n“I think the most important piece is that you really want to provide personalized care in order to optimize somebody’s weight/health journey,” said Michelle Cardel, PhD, chief nutrition officer at WeightWatchers and a registered dietitian.\n\nThe behavioral piece, including diet and exercise, is the cornerstone, Cardel said. It can be used alone or in combination with pharmacological treatment or bariatric surgery.\n\nMihir Patel, MD, also tries to personalize programs for his patients who mostly have class 2 and class 3 obesity (with a body mass index of at least 35). Patel, an obesity medicine specialist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, talks to patients about their weight history, whether obesity was present since childhood or whether there were particular points when their weight increased significantly.\n\nHe goes through everything they eat throughout the course of a day and then may recommend a specific diet, he said, such as the mediterranean diet, a more plant-based diet, the ketogenic diet (very low carbohydrates) or the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, an evidenced-based approach.\n\nPatel may also help patients structure their day to “time their meals or use different foods to try to help them with weight loss, to help them balance hunger and satiation,” he said.\n\nFor example, one of his patients wasn’t eating much before exercising in the evening and was gaining weight, so Patel encouraged him to eat a more substantial breakfast and have more protein for lunch before going into his evening work-out routine.\n\nPatel also generally offers GLP-1 RA medications to patients who qualify on their first visit.\n\nRobert Kushner, MD, a professor in the Departments of Medicine and Medical Education at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago tries to find out where patients with obesity are at with nutrition and then encourages them to get healthy in a stepwise or progressive fashion. If a patient generally has a bagel with cream cheese and coffee with cream from Dunkin’ Donuts for breakfast, he suggests they consider substituting foods that are higher in protein and lower in sugar such as yogurt with fruit, a protein bar, or an English muffin with peanut butter.\n\nDon’t expect to accomplish everything in one visit either, he said. If the patient cannot return for another visit in a month, consider reaching out to them to check in on their progress using a telehealth method, he said. Doctors can also consider referring patients to a registered dietitian for more in-depth guidance. There are also apps, such as MyFitnessPal, where patients can track their daily food consumption which helps build awareness of the calories you’re taking in, he said.\n\nWeightWatchers now offers a specialized lifestyle program for members taking a GLP-1 RA medicine. Pairing the GLP-1 RA, if it is advised, with a behavioral program focusing on diet and exercise is key to success and that’s why the US Food and Drug Administration recommends a lifestyle modification program to accompany these medications, Cardel said.\n\nThis tailored program also monitors a person’s protein and vegetable intake and water consumption, Hall said.\n\n“Because all of that is important, that you’re getting like all of the nutrients and protein,” she said.\n\nIt’s also important to make sure you’re not losing muscle, she added. Because you’re on a GLP-1 RA, the WeightWatchers points system doesn’t really matter because the medication is going to suppress one’s appetite and make it harder to digest certain foods. Hall was also able to see a registered dietitian monthly.\n\nThe focus of the lifestyle program for those taking a GLP-1 RA is on nutritional adequacy, making sure patients eat enough protein, stay hydrated and engage in resistance training at least two to three times a week, Cardel said. The dietary piece can also help with unwanted side effects of the medication including nausea, vomiting, and constipation.\n\nFor those who don’t take a GLP-1, the calorie deficit must be a part of the equation, Cardel said. Most people who are overweight should focus on losing 1-2 pounds per week and that usually happens by cutting 500-750 calories per day, Cardel said. Food tracking is one of the most “evidence-based” ways to lose weight.\n\nAt WeightWatchers, participants have a daily points budget which helps facilitate this deficit, but “we also have a weekly point budget and that provides the built-in flexibility” she said. If you want to go out for dinner with friends and have wine and dessert, for example, you can use your weekly points budget.\n\nThe hope is to “behaviorally nudge people” to healthier options while still being in a calorie deficit, Cardel said.\n\nPoints are personalized based on a person’s height, weight, age, and sex. Points also go down for foods higher in protein and fiber and up for foods higher in added sugar and saturated fats. There are also many zero-point foods — such as seafood, lentils, fruits, or oats.\n\n“There are always go-to healthy food options that you can reach for,” Cardel said. Focus on getting 30 g of protein at every meal and 30 g of fiber per day, she said.\n\nThe goal is for people to stay on the program long-term, Cardel said.\n\n‘Weaving in Fitness’\n\nPeople also should engage in moderate to vigorous physical activity for at least 30 minutes a day or at least 150 minutes per week, Cardel said, and incorporate strength training. However, when Patel sees obese patients, he tries not to “harp on exercise” during the first visit.\n\n“…Some of the data shows that if you gradually weave in exercise kind of over their weight loss journey and kind of build toward something, that people end up doing better, they kind of stick with the exercise and end up keeping more weight off in the long run,” Patel said.\n\nHe refers to this randomized controlled clinical trial (published in Obesity in 2019) which concluded that the “timing of exercise initiation can be personalized based on patient preference.”\n\nIf people want to exercise hard, he supports that, but usually for most people he suggests taking small steps like parking further away from your destination, wearing ankle weights while doing laundry or cooking at home. Then he recommends gradually weaving in more exercise over time. People are relieved when he tells them they don’t have to go all the way into exercise. Finding the time to exercise can be a challenge and it can take time to figure that out.\n\nAlso, “a lot of people just have physical limitations. And as we kind of lose weight with some of the other methods they can kind of build in some more exercises in there, you know their back feels better, their knees feel better.”\n\nWhen Kushner sees patients, he finds out how much they are already exercising and builds from there. If they’re already walking, then perhaps add 10 minutes, he suggests. Also set realistic and attainable goals, he said. Don’t just say walk more, say walk 3 days a week at a set pace. That’s doable.\n\nThere’s another reason Patel doesn’t fixate on exercise. “As a purely weight loss tool, it’s probably not the best tool,” he said,\n\nResearch shows that for every 10 pounds you lose, about eight are the result of the changes in diet and about two of them are likely reflective of changes made in physical activity, Cardel said.\n\nBut exercise is still important during the weight loss piece because of all the benefits for overall health and well-being including mental health and heart health, Cardel said.\n\nIt also helps with fitness and strength, Kushner added.\n\nExercise does work well for maintaining weight loss, but it takes working out for about 1 hour a day to keep the weight off, he said.\n\nIt’s key to find a type of exercise you enjoy, and you’ll be more likely to stick with it, Cardel said. While many people think you have to be doing a really intense workout, the reality is you just need to move your body. “It can be as simple as taking a walk,” she said.\n\nReal World Results\n\nWhen Hall first started on Mounjaro, she didn’t do any physical activity and focused only on acclimating herself to the medication. She felt nauseous and it was hard to move at first, but over time she began to build in more physical activity. Ten years earlier when Hall lost weight, she lived in the gym 6 days a week, but this time she wanted to do it in a more sustainable way.\n\nShe started by walking about 1 mile per day during her breaks at work. “Fifteen minutes of movement a day is attainable,” she said.\n\nShe also began lifting weights at home for at least 15 minutes per day. The strength training was particularly important to maintain muscle mass as Mounjaro caused rapid weight loss in the beginning for Hall.\n\nToday, she weighs 187 pounds (122 pounds is muscle). She is proud of herself. She can run and keep up with her kids.\n\n“Looking good is one thing, but feeling good, being healthy, that’s something totally different. That’s where it’s at,” she said.",
      "# [Sait Tunc receives NSF CAREER award to optimize health care systems for equitable outcomes on 2024-04-05](https://news.vt.edu/articles/2024/04/tunc-career-award.html)\nIn an effort to revolutionize the health care system through operations research and systems engineering, Sait Tunc, an assistant professor in the Grado Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, has received a National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award.\n\nThe CAREER program supports early career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education and lead advances in the missions of their department or organization. This five-year grant totaling $568,619 will support Tunc’s research on inefficiencies in health care systems, particularly with respect to organ transplants. And it couldn’t be more timely.\n\nTunc’s research regarding organ utilization comes at a pivotal time in the industry. While organ scarcity exists, there is also a significant level of underutilization. Roughly 25 percent of organs recovered from deceased donors go unused for a variety of reasons. Patients may refuse organ offers because they come from a relatively higher risk donor, or they may choose to wait to see if another “better” organ becomes available. Additionally, patients with access to higher quality health care may receive special priority.\n\n“I want to identify disadvantaged patients and improve their access to organs. Federal law prevents penalizing patients for rejecting organ offers, which creates a gap between what is optimal for the individuals and how they behave. One mechanism I developed identifies disadvantaged patient groups who have reduced access to organs, thus a higher mortality rate,” Tunc said.\n\nIn addition to matching organs to recipients more efficiently, Tunc also wants to ensure equitable access for all in need. Perhaps surprisingly, this means taking into consideration voluntary incentive mechanisms, which prioritize motivating patients based on data rather than removing the option of choice. For example, instead of mandating participation, such as forcing a patient to accept an organ of relatively lower quality, voluntary incentive mechanisms give patients agency by showing them why they could reject an organ, but why they’d be better off accepting it rather than, say, remaining on dialysis.\n\n“We use data modeling to prioritize these patients for organ offers that are most beneficial to them. This improves the match between donors and recipients and addresses the issue of organ underutilization,” Tunc said. “The challenge in organ procurement is not just about finding more donors, but ensuring that the organs are used efficiently and equitably. I want to bridge the gap between what is best for society and how individuals behave.”\n\nIncentivizing healthy behavior\n\nVoluntary incentive mechanisms work at large-scale and individual levels, and Tunc’s research addresses both. He investigates how these strategies lead to an increase in wellness-related behaviors, such as exercise or tobacco cessation. This aspect of his proposal aims to encourage healthier behaviors considering that not everyone has the same level of delay discounting and using someone’s willingness to adopt healthier activities based on what reward they would receive if they change their habits.\n\n“My primary goal with this research is to design and implement voluntary incentive mechanisms in the health care field, for both organizations and individuals,” Tunc said. “Rather than use coercion or mandated participation, voluntary incentive mechanisms encourage participants through rewards. These tend to make implementing new strategies easier compared to traditional approaches in health care and improve outcomes at the individual, organizational, and societal levels.”\n\nUsing voluntary incentive mechanisms, Tunc’s research seeks to\n\nAlleviate the burden of organ scarcity, reduce the size of the transplant waiting list, improve the access of marginalized groups to transplants, and mitigate waitlist deaths\n\nPartner with Organ Procurement Organizations to expand organ availability and overall procurement\n\nReduce disparities in transplant access, especially for those at a significant disadvantage, including older patients and patients of color\n\nAlign individual actions with societal health goals, promote healthy behaviors, and improve long-term health outcomes especially among those most in need, such as individuals living with addiction or obesity\n\nAs part of the National Science Foundation’s support for educational outreach, the impacts of Tunc’s award will span from undergraduate engineering students to medical professionals, including a partnership with Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Virginia State University (VSU).\n\nHealth care providers can adjust their response to patients based on their willingness to adopt healthier behaviors. Tunc is hopeful this strategy will encourage people to adopt healthier habits while feeling they have choices in their decision making.\n\n“It’s crucial to design programs that actually motivate people to adopt healthier behaviors by considering all these individual differences in delay discounting, which explains why some people might not find long-term rewards as enticing. People that show addictive behavior, for example, are typically associated with higher delay discounting,” Tunc said. “This will enable researchers to find strategies that work for different groups.”\n\nThe future of health care systems\n\nTunc plans to use this research as an opportunity to educate others on how operations research and systems engineering and the use of voluntary incentive mechanisms can be beneficial for those working in the health care field, including short courses for medical students on implementing voluntary incentive mechanisms, and research education that will benefit undergraduate and graduate students at Virginia Tech and beyond.\n\n\"Our partnership with VSU is quite detailed, providing summer undergraduate research assistantship opportunities for VSU students at Virginia Tech, and offering an in-person opportunity for them to engage with groups in our department and elsewhere at the university,” Tunc said. “We hope we can engage students from multiple backgrounds and disciplines to participate, and encourage them to consider health care-related studies.”\n\nTunc’s grant-related research has informed his curriculum, including two new graduate level courses addressing health systems. Looking even further, Tunc hopes the research will impact policymakers from the top down while solving this complex global challenge.\n\n\"Beyond the direct educational interventions, the outreach activities associated with this research aim for policy change at the national level,” Tunc said. “Engaging with key stakeholders and policymakers ensures that the outcomes of this research are understood and potentially integrated into the national health care system.”",
      "# [AHRQ Strategic Plan for Health System Transformation To Optimize Health, Functional Status, and Well-Being Among Older Adults](https://www.ahrq.gov/priority-populations/publications/aging-well.html)\nThe U.S. population is rapidly aging, and the health system is ill-prepared to meet the needs of older adults. Older adults and individuals with multiple chronic conditions frequently receive fragmented and sub-optimal care, leading to poor outcomes, including avoidable adverse events, hospitalizations, and institutionalization, as well as increased costs negatively impacting the sustainability of Medicare and state Medicaid programs.\n\nBy re-engineering healthcare delivery systems so that care transformation optimizes health outcomes, functional status, and well-being, much of the morbidity and premature mortality associated with aging can be delayed or slowed, and chronic conditions can be effectively managed, allowing people to live independently and contribute to their communities longer.\n\nThis Strategic Plan details five goals and related strategies to achieve these goals for health system transformation that optimizes the health, functional status, and well-being among older adults.",

Biohacking, an emerging and revolutionary approach to human enhancement, offers just that.\n\n​​​​​​​Image Credit: Girts Ragelis/Shutterstock.com\n\nIntroduction\n\nBiohacking has surged in popularity as a means to optimize health and extend lifespan, blending scientific advancements with a do-it-yourself ethos. At its core, biohacking encompasses a wide range of strategies, from lifestyle modifications to cutting-edge biotechnology.1\n\nWhile some methods, like optimizing diet, exercise, and sleep, have strong scientific backing, more experimental approaches, such as implantable technologies and genetic self-modification, raise ethical and safety concerns.1\n\nOne scientifically supported biohacking strategy is the use of wearable biosensors to track physiological data, allowing individuals to fine-tune their health in real-time.1\n\nAdditionally, dietary interventions such as intermittent fasting and ketogenic diets have been shown to enhance metabolic health and promote longevity by influencing cellular pathways like autophagy and insulin sensitivity.2\n\nSupplementing with nootropics or compounds that may improve cognitive function is another avenue under investigation, with some substances like caffeine and omega-3 fatty acids demonstrating benefits.3\n\nHowever, more extreme biohacking methods, including self-experimentation with gene editing or unregulated supplements, lack robust scientific validation and pose significant risks. Additionally, the use of implantable technologies, where individuals insert Radio\n\nFrequency Identification and Near Field Communication chips, biosensors, or magnets into their bodies to interact with electronic devices or augment their senses have raised significant ethical concerns.1\n\nAs biohacking continues to evolve, distinguishing evidence-based strategies from speculative or hazardous practices remains essential for its responsible application.1\n\nThis article explores five evidence-based biohacking strategies with the potential to promote longevity.\n\nThe Rise of Postbiotics for Gut Health\n\nIntermittent fasting\n\nIntermittent fasting involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting, promoting metabolic adaptation. Research suggests that intermittent fasting enhances longevity by triggering autophagy, reducing oxidative stress, and improving insulin sensitivity.4\n\nA key mechanism behind these benefits is the metabolic switch from glucose to ketone-based energy, which has been linked to improved mitochondrial function and reduced inflammation.5\n\nStudies indicate that intermittent fasting may lower the risk of metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative conditions.2 Additionally, intermittent fasting has been shown to modulate gut microbiota, which plays a crucial role in immune function, inflammation, and overall health.5\n\nFurthermore, emerging research suggests that intermittent fasting can also influence gene expression related to longevity by activating sirtuins, a family of proteins involved in cellular repair and aging.4\n\nHowever, the long-term implications of different intermittent fasting protocols remain an area of active research, necessitating further clinical trials to establish optimal fasting durations for longevity benefits.\n\nDespite its benefits, intermittent fasting is not suitable for everyone. Individuals with certain metabolic disorders, pregnant women, or those with a history of eating disorders should consult a medical professional before attempting fasting regimens.2\n\nFuture studies should focus on personalized approaches, considering factors such as genetic predisposition, lifestyle, and existing health conditions.\n\nCold exposure therapy\n\nCold exposure, including practices such as ice baths and cryotherapy, induces hormesis — a biological phenomenon where mild stressors elicit adaptive benefits. Exposure to cold also activates brown adipose tissue (BAT), leading to enhanced thermogenesis and metabolic efficiency.6\n\nMoreover, research suggests that cold exposure modulates immune function, reducing inflammation and neuroinflammation.7 This effect may be particularly relevant for aging, as chronic low-grade inflammation is a key driver of age-related diseases.\n\nIn addition to reducing inflammation, cold exposure has been linked to increased norepinephrine levels, which contribute to improved mood, cognitive function, and stress resilience.7,8\n\nSome studies suggest that regular exposure to cold temperatures may even enhance cardiovascular health by improving vascular function and circulation.8\n\nHowever, excessive cold exposure can be harmful, leading to hypothermia or increased cardiovascular strain in individuals with pre-existing health conditions.8 It is essential to adopt a gradual approach, starting with brief cold showers or localized ice application before progressing to more extreme methods such as ice baths.\n\nFurther research is essential to determine the ideal duration and frequency of cold exposure to maximize longevity benefits while minimizing potential risks.\n\nDownload your PDF copy now!\n\nNutrigenomics and supplements\n\nNutrigenomics explores the relationship between genes, diet, and health, allowing for personalized nutritional interventions. Certain compounds, such as nicotinamide mononucleotide and resveratrol, have been studied for their potential role in enhancing cellular energy production and lifespan extension.\n\nNicotinamide mononucleotide supplementation has been shown to boost the levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a coenzyme critical for mitochondrial function and cellular repair, which declines with age.9\n\nSimilarly, resveratrol, a polyphenol found in red wine, has been linked to the activation of sirtuins, proteins associated with lifespan extension in various organisms.10\n\nPolyphenols such as quercetin and curcumin have also been studied for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which may contribute to healthy aging.\n\nRecent advancements in microbiome research have also highlighted the role of gut bacteria in metabolizing nutrients and influencing health outcomes. Probiotics and prebiotics may enhance gut health, promoting better nutrient absorption and immune function.\n\nAdditionally, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, and magnesium are emerging as key nutrients in longevity science, with studies linking them to reduced risks of chronic diseases.10,3\n\nWhile nutrigenomics shows promise, supplementation should be tailored to individual needs. Overuse of certain compounds can lead to adverse effects, and more research is needed to establish optimal dosages and long-term safety.\n\nIs The Carnivore Diet Healthy?\n\nRegulating circadian rhythms for longevity\n\nQuality sleep is a crucial determinant of longevity, with evidence linking disrupted sleep patterns to increased risks of cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, and metabolic disorders.11 Melatonin, a hormone that regulates circadian rhythms, plays a key role in sleep quality and longevity.\n\nMaintaining a consistent sleep schedule and minimizing exposure to artificial light at night can improve sleep quality and support healthy aging.\n\nAligning lifestyle habits with natural circadian rhythms, such as enhancing exposure to natural light to increase melatonin production, may also promote optimal hormonal balance and metabolic efficiency.12\n\nIn addition to melatonin, sleep hygiene practices such as reducing caffeine intake, optimizing the bedroom environment, and engaging in relaxation techniques before bed contribute to better sleep quality. Poor sleep has been associated with increased levels of beta-amyloid, a protein linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.12\n\nMoreover, emerging research suggests that deep sleep plays a crucial role in metabolic regulation, immune function, and brain detoxification.\n\nFuture studies should also explore the interplay between sleep and longevity, identifying potential interventions to enhance sleep efficiency and mitigate age-related decline.\n\nNeuroplasticity and cognitive health\n\nCognitive decline is a major challenge in aging populations. Strategies to enhance neuroplasticity — such as meditation, brain-training exercises, and nootropic compounds — have been extensively investigated for their potential to slow cognitive aging and improve mental resilience.3\n\nMeditation has also been shown to reduce stress-related neuroinflammation, while studies have reported that certain nootropics, such as caffeine, may enhance cognitive function.\n\nRegular physical exercise, particularly aerobic and resistance training, has been associated with increased neurogenesis and improved brain health.3\n\nTechnological advancements in neurofeedback and brain-computer interfaces may further enhance cognitive longevity.\n\nCurrent studies are striving to identify the most effective cognitive enhancement strategies while balancing efficacy with ethical considerations and safety.\n\nThe longevity blueprint: Key takeaways\n\nBiohacking presents a promising avenue for longevity optimization, but it requires a critical and evidence-based approach.\n\nWhile intermittent fasting, cold exposure, nutrigenomics, sleep optimization, and neuroplasticity interventions show scientific merit, their long-term implications need further exploration.\n\nThe current understanding suggests that future research should focus on refining these strategies and personalizing interventions to maximize their benefits while minimizing risks.\n\nAdopting a holistic, scientifically validated approach to biohacking may provide a sustainable pathway to extended health span and improved quality of life.\n\nReferences\n\nYetisen A.

      "# [The Near Future of RPM and CCM with Artificial Intelligence on 2024-04-16](https://optimize.health/blog/the-near-future-of-rpm-and-ccm-with-artificial-intelligence/)\nWHY A.I.?\n\nArtificial Intelligence (A.I.) is more than a buzzword—it’s a transformative force set to revolutionize healthcare sectors, starting with Remote Care. Due to the extensive data collected through Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) and Chronic Care Management (CCM), A.I. is uniquely positioned to streamline healthcare services. By analyzing large datasets, A.I. can recognize trends and offer accurate predictions, allowing providers to offer individualized care, drastically improving efficiency compared to traditional methods.\n\nWhat Data Will A.I. Leverage?\n\nData is the new gold in 2024 and when it comes to A.I., you’re going to get out of it what you give it. A.I.’s outputs are directly related to the input they receive. These advanced algorithms can provide tailored healthcare solutions when fed detailed patient data. For example, this could include dietary plans that consider medical conditions, i.e. obesity or hypertension, as well as personal circumstances, like allergies, budget constraints, and local food availability. This multidimensional analysis through A.I., enables care that truly reflects the patient’s individual lifestyle and geographical context.\n\nIntegrating Recent A.I. Research into Healthcare:\n\nReflect on the findings of Abhishek Gireeshkumar et al. (2023), which dive into A.I.’s transformative role in healthcare processes. The study highlights how A.I. can refine diagnostics, treatment plans, and bring personalized medicine to the forefront of care. This is vital for RPM and CCM’s success. A.I.’s capability to parse and interpret extensive data from RPM devices means conditions can be anticipated and treated proactively. In regards to CCM, the subjective data can be analyzed month over month to determine trends or gaps in care plans that providers may have missed.\n\nFurthermore, the research stresses A.I.’s utility in crafting patient-specific healthcare, a significant leap from one-size-fits-all approaches. Yet, it also confronts the ethical and data security challenges intrinsic to A.I. deployment in healthcare, reminding us of the careful balance needed between technological advancement and patient privacy.\n\nWhat Are The Risks? What About Data Privacy?\n\nAs the healthcare industry embraces AI, several hurdles must be addressed, particularly around data privacy and HIPAA compliance. Ensuring the security of patient data against breaches, preventing misuse of information, and maintaining transparency are paramount. Additionally, there’s the challenge of avoiding data bias. For instance, if an AI system is primarily trained on health data from middle-aged adults, it might be less accurate in diagnosing conditions in younger or older people, potentially leading to unfair/poorly advised treatments. It is crucial to ensure AI systems comply with existing and future regulations, while still fostering a sense of trust and personal connection between patients and providers. Overcoming these hurdles is essential for the responsible and effective integration of AI into healthcare.\n\nWill A.I. Replace Us?\n\nThe short answer? No, not for a long time. While A.I. will dramatically enhance efficiency in healthcare, it is far from replacing human clinicians entirely. A.I.’s role is to supplement and enhance our capabilities, allowing us to deliver better care by freeing up time and providing deeper insights into patient health. The human elements of empathy, ethical judgment, and professional intuition remain central to patient care, with A.I. serving as a powerful tool to support but not supplant our work. Let’s not forget, the relationship that healthcare providers have with their patients is invaluable and should never be underestimated or neglected.\n\nCost Implications and Market Dynamics in A.I. Adoption:\n\nThe healthcare AI market is highly competitive one and is constantly evolving, which fuels innovation and leads to a wide range of prices for AI tools. Despite initial costs, many A.I. tools, particularly those from open-source platforms, are available for free. When it comes to customization and integration, that’s when additional expenses come into play. As the market grows and technology advances, competition is expected to drive down prices, making A.I. tools more accessible and offering significant long-term savings.\n\nHealthcare professionals should weigh these upfront investments against the potential for streamlined operations and improved outcomes. Staying informed about the latest developments in cost-effective A.I. solutions will enable informed decisions that balance financial and clinical benefits, paving the way for a future where A.I. is an integral, affordable part of patient care. The added cost, however, isn’t expected to fall on the burden on the providers, but rather on the remote care partners.\n\nLooking Ahead: What’s Next in A.I. and Healthcare\n\nAs we dive deeper into combining A.I. and healthcare, remember, we’re just starting to explore what’s possible. For doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals, this new world of A.I. offers an opportunity to shift the focus back to patients rather than being overwhelmed with paperwork. It’s about enhancing the human element in healthcare by streamlining routine tasks and allowing more time for patient care.\n\nYes, there are bumps along the road with A.I., but there are also big chances to make things better. We need to keep learning and stay smart about how we use A.I., so we can use these new tools to make healthcare kinder, quicker, and more effective for each patient.\n\nWe’re moving fast, and the future might get here before we know it. A.I. is set to change healthcare in ways we’re just beginning to imagine. But one thing’s for sure: the changes are coming, and they’ll likely make it easier for providers to care for their patients.\n\nSo, let’s stay open to new ideas and get ready for what’s coming. The A.I. journey we’re all headed it’s going to be exciting! Stay tuned for more updates on how AI is transforming healthcare and how Optimize Health is empowering providers to deliver the best care to their patients.",
