      "# [Optimize Health](https://optimize.health/blogs/)\nCCM Physician Type/Specialty RPM\n\nHow ACOs Can Leverage Chronic Disease Management Software\n\nThe Advanced Primary Care Management (APCM) codes introduced in the 2025 Physician Fee Schedule Proposed Rule offer a value-based care approach to managing primary care and chronic care patients. This streamlined alternative replaces time-based Chronic Care Management (CCM), Principal Care Management (PCM), and Transition Care Management (TCM) codes with a set of bundled codes. What are the Advanced Primary Care Management (APCM) codes? The APCM codes provide a flat fee per primary care patient per month with no need to track time. Practices could dramatically reduce the administrative billing burden and likely increase profitability depending on their patient population. The proposed codes and rates include: GPCM1: Any primary care patient is eligible for a proposed reimbursement of $10 per patient per month GPMC2: Similar to CCM code requirements, patients must have 2 or more chronic conditions to be eligible for a proposed reimbursement of $50 per patient per month/patient GPCM3: Similar chronic care requirements to GPMC2 but with a higher proposed reimbursement for Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) at $110 per patient per month; this compensates practices for the increased resources required to care for these patients, who are under the federal poverty level and often have social determinants of health issues and limited access to care While the proposed reimbursement rates are generally lower than CCM or similar services each month, it potentially provides reimbursement for a larger number of patients since there are no time-based requirements to meet. What are the Advanced Primary Care Management (APCM) requirements? While the APCM codes do not require time tracking per patient, they do require 13 service elements to be available to all patients. Many of these elements are already required for providing CCM and are likely relatively easy for most practices to provide. Patient Consent: Patients must consent to the service and consent must be documented in their medical record. Initiating Visit: New patients or those who have not had a visit in three years must have an initiating appointment for APCM. 24/7 Access: Patients must have 24/7 access to urgent care access with a care team/practitioner. Continuity of Care: A designated team member must provide continuity of care for routine appointments. Alternative Care Delivery: Home visits, extended hours, telehealth, and/or non-traditional office visits must be available. Comprehensive Care Management: Systematic needs assessment, preventative services, medication reconciliation, and oversight of self-management are available. Electronic Care Plan: A comprehensive electronic care plan is documented, managed, and accessible to the patient and provider. Care Transitions Coordination: The provider can facilitate transitions between healthcare settings and providers with timely follow-up communication. Ongoing Communication: Practice coordinates across various service providers to communicate and document the patient’s needs and preferences. Enhanced Communication Methods: Communication is available through digital means, such as secure messaging, email, and patient portals. Population Data Analysis: Analysis can be conducted to identify care gaps and provide care interventions. Risk Stratification: Data can be used to identify and proactively offer services to high-risk patients. Performance Measurement: Providers can assess the quality and total cost of care and demonstrate the use of Certified EHR Technology. Who should adopt Advanced Primary Care Management (APCM) codes if approved? While APCM codes cannot be billed concurrently with CCM or PCM codes, they can be billed in conjunction with RPM and RTM codes. Currently, for patients dual-enrolled in CCM and RPM time spent on many patient activities must be attributed to either CCM or RPM time but cannot be double-counted. In reality, most practices attribute time that qualifies for either to CCM since it has higher reimbursement. That means fewer patients are meeting the threshold for billing RPM CPT® Codes 99457 and 99458 since only time from certain activities like reminding patients to take readings and analyzing readings are attributed to RPM. With APCM, practices can bill APCM and then apply all time that would have fallen under the CCM or RPM time codes to RPM. This allows practices to collect APCM revenue on all primary care patients and maximize RPM reimbursements for chronic care patients. It also dramatically simplifies time accounting and billing. This could help practices increase revenue while improving the quality of care, particularly in managing patients with chronic conditions. Increasing RPM enrollment and revenue With the simplicity of APCM codes, practices can look to provide proactive, continuous care to more patients without concern for overlapping time between CCM and RPM. For practices with limited staff, a managed RPM solution can improve outcomes and increase total practice revenue without impacting CCM programs or overburdening staff. Remote monitoring staff that acts as an extension of a practice’s team can provide cost-effective RPM care without needing to track any overlapping time with CCM care. Value-based care is here to stay and the APCM codes are one step in that direction. Once approved, practices can take the dependable reimbursement of APCM with minimal administrative support and still bill for time associated with RPM.

      "# [Remote Healthcare on 2024-03-20](https://optimize.health/remote-healthcare/)\nHealthcare companies have developed healthcare software that provides remote health solutions using digital tools such as monitoring devices. These solutions allow medical service providers to track and test patients outside traditional healthcare settings, leading to better health services and improved patient outcomes.\n\nAt its core, remote healthcare involves monitoring tools and software platforms. Patient monitoring devices can track vital health metrics like blood pressure, blood glucose, and weight and automatically send that information to caregivers. This continuous monitoring allows providers to spot real-time health changes and potential issues. *Remote care* software platforms then aggregate all this data to give medical professionals a single view of each patient’s health status and progress.\n\nWith these insights, remote healthcare companies can proactively manage patient care plans. They can also easily coordinate care teams and communicate with patients and caregivers more effectively. As a result, providers can spend less time reacting to health crises and more time preventing issues and catching problems early. For patients, remote healthcare means convenience since they can receive routine check-ins, ask and answer questions, and adjust medication from the comfort of their own homes.\n\nRemote patient monitoring is typically used for managing chronic conditions. However, the benefits of remote healthcare extend to post-hospital care, complex disease management, and general population health. RPM companies continuously improve monitoring devices and software platforms, and that means remote care will become an even more critical component of how healthcare is delivered in the future.\n\nThe opportunities for improving outcomes and patient experience through remote healthcare solutions are endless. Remote monitoring programs that use wearable devices, mobile apps, and telehealth tools have the power to uncover new insights. They can detect health changes that traditional in-office visits miss.\n\nInnovative remote health companies are leading the way toward a future in which healthcare will undoubtedly include more virtual visits. It will also involve remote patient monitoring and software, which will enhance the capabilities of providers and care teams.\n\nRemote healthcare relies heavily on technology to provide remote health services to patients at home. With remote healthcare platforms, patients can access medical staff without visiting a doctor’s office. In addition, patients can get essential healthcare services and monitor chronic conditions from their homes.\n\nBy using such technology, healthcare providers gain tools that give them a better picture of a patient’s health between office visits. With this transformation of how patients access and receive medical care, medical staff can be more proactive in caring for patients and addressing issues before they become serious.\n\nSome examples of remote healthcare services include:\n\nTelemedicine: Patients have virtual consultations with doctors and specialists via video or phone instead of in-person visits. This allows patients to get medical advice and assistance from a distance.\n\nRemote patient monitoring: Patients with chronic conditions can use devices and sensors at home that transmit health data. Vital signs, such as blood pressure, pulse, and breathing rates, along with blood sugar levels and weight, are transmitted remotely to healthcare providers. This allows providers to monitor patients’ health between in-person checkups.\n\nePrescriptions: Doctors send prescriptions electronically to pharmacies instead of providing a physical piece of paper, which streamlines the process for patients to get their medications.\n\nOnline health assessments: Patients can complete health surveys and questionnaires online to assess their symptoms and overall health. This can help identify potential issues and direct them to the right provider or treatment options.\n\nVirtual therapists and counseling: Patients can connect with mental health providers through video calls and messaging apps to get emotional support and therapy from anywhere.\n\nOnline appointment scheduling: Patients can schedule and manage their appointments through an online portal or app connected to their healthcare provider, eliminating the need to call during office hours.\n\nRemote healthcare is more accessible and convenient for patients while helping providers improve the quality and effectiveness of their care. As technology progresses, it will continue to transform how patients interact with the entire healthcare system.\n\nRemote healthcare monitoring refers to using technology to monitor patients from a distance outside medical facilities. With remote health monitoring devices and systems, patients can receive care and track their health from home.\n\nIt helps achieve improved health outcomes by enabling early detection of health changes, reducing hospital readmissions, improving medication adherence, and streamlining follow-up care. This is done through a remote health monitoring system that sends patient health data to clinicians and care teams in close to real-time.\n\nSeveral remote healthcare monitoring systems and devices can monitor patients’ conditions from afar. They include the following:\n\nBlood Pressure Monitors: These are cuff-based monitors that patients can use at home to measure and transmit their blood pressure readings to their doctors. Doctors can monitor for high or low blood pressure issues.\n\nWeight Scales: Smart weight scales can measure a patient’s weight and body composition, then send that data wirelessly to their doctor or care team. This helps monitor for weight gain or loss issues.\n\nGlucose Monitors: Continuous glucose monitors use a small sensor inserted under the skin to constantly measure blood sugar levels in diabetic patients. They can transmit readings to an app for patients and doctors to monitor.\n\nECG Monitors: Electrocardiogram devices can measure a patient’s heart rhythm and electrical activity. The data is transmitted to doctors who can monitor for arrhythmias or other cardiac issues.\n\nOxygen Saturation Monitors: Pulse oximeters clip onto a patient’s finger to measure blood oxygen levels. Chronic conditions like COPD require frequent monitoring, so wireless oximeters send readings to doctors to detect issues early.\n\nActivity Trackers: Fitness trackers and smartwatches can track patients’ activity levels, steps, sleep, etc., and share that data with doctors to monitor mobility issues and functional decline.\n\nCameras/Sensors: In-home sensors and camera systems allow remote patient monitoring, which is particularly helpful for older adults and people with cognitive issues. Motion sensors can detect if a patient has fallen, and cameras can allow medical professionals to visually check in on high-risk patients.\n\nAll these remote health monitoring devices work like an early warning system. They alert clinicians about an anomaly before a small problem becomes a significant health issue.",

      "# [Managed RPM Services Help Staff Shortages on 2021-12-10](https://optimize.health/blog/staffing-shortages/)\nStaffing shortages are, unfortunately, nothing new for many healthcare organizations. Many pandemic-related factors, including increasing retirements and resignations from COVID-fatigue, have made the health care labor crisis worse. Add in increasing absences due to quarantine and illness, a reduction in foreign-educated nurses due to immigration limits, and highly-compensated “travel” RN positions, it’s not surprising that 16 percent of US hospitals had critical staffing shortages as of Oct 1. Staff shortages in healthcare are projected to reach 3.2 million by 2026.\n\nVaccine Mandates – Patient Benefits, Potential Staffing Challenges\n\nThe federal government has proposed a vaccine mandate requirement for Medicare and Medicaid participating healthcare providers that would cover more than 17 million healthcare workers.\n\nSome healthcare providers are concerned that this mandate could further fuel staffing shortages. While vaccine compliance rates have been high among healthcare workers, some executives fear that losing even a very small number of workers to mandates could have a significant impact.\n\nMany healthcare organizations, including the American Hospital Association (AHA), have advocated for vaccine mandates describing them as a “logical fulfillment of the ethical commitment of all healthcare workers to put patients as well as residents of long-term care facilities first.” Many large healthcare organizations, including Kaiser Permanente, have already implemented vaccine mandates and have retained over 99% of their staff. They have reported small numbers of employees lost to resignation or termination.\n\nThe AHA acknowledges that while vaccine mandates have many benefits, they could be difficult for smaller or more rural health systems that have limited sourcing options for nurses. Rural hospital executives concerned about having insufficient patient care staff have been reluctant to voluntarily implement mandates.\n\nProviders Need Innovative Staffing Solutions\n\nAs healthcare providers navigate the mandates, it’s clear they will need to be more resourceful and efficient in caring for patients. Even without mandates, staffing shortages will persist and any innovative solution that improves patient care with less staff should be considered. Some of these solutions may involve shifting the way care is delivered to appeal to a larger or different pool of clinical resources. For example, many nurses that have burned out on the hospital floor or in a physician practice, may be willing to consider returning to the field in a flexible, remote, part-time position.\n\nWhile it may be impractical for a physician’s office to hire and manage a part-time, remote nurse that only provides virtual care, they could outsource this function to a company that has a pool of remote nurses to serve exactly that function. This could allow a practice to dramatically expand the reach of their virtual care programs without adding to their current workload, or possibly even reducing the workload of in-office nurses.\n\nManaged RPM Can Help Alleviate Staffing Challenges\n\nRemote Patient Monitoring (RPM), a digital health solution that allows providers and their staff to monitor patients’ health from a distance, is a great place to start. Many RPM providers, including Optimize Health, offer managed RPM services where the RPM company provides outsourced nurses that act as an extension of your existing clinical staff team. This allows your practice to increase the direct clinical care time patients are receiving without directly hiring new staff, and may help reduce the number of routine patient calls your overworked nurses directly field on a daily basis.\n\nIf you are considering outsourcing or partnering with an RPM partner that provides nurses to assist with remote care services, what should you look for? We suggest conducting a virtual interview with your potential partner and ensuring the clinical staff not only demonstrates excellent clinical skills, but can effectively engage with patients in a virtual environment. Nurses working with patients in a virtual environment not only need to be comfortable with technology, they may need to be able to explain technology to patients as well. They also need a strong work ethic, an ability to work independently, and a passion for using motivational strategies to drive patient behavior changes.\n\nThe pandemic has fundamentally and permanently changed the way we deliver and receive services and healthcare is no exception. When implemented correctly, leveraging remote work and virtual care has the potential to both improve patient care and increase your staffing capacity.\n\nLearn More",

      "# [RPM Onboarding Event for Patients on 2022-04-08](https://optimize.health/blog/onboarding-event/)\nWhat is a Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) onboarding event? An onboarding event involves dedicating staff time and rooms exclusively to RPM onboarding appointments for one or more days. This focus can enable you to ramp your RPM program quickly, allowing more patients to benefit from RPM immediately.\n\nWhy Have an Onboarding Event?\n\nWithout an onboarding event, many practices struggle to get RPM off the ground. They may add a few patients during their routine visits once they have RPM devices, but without the opportunity for the entire office team to work together to create RPM processes, it stalls.\n\nAn onboarding event is a great opportunity to partner with your RPM vendor to really learn how to make RPM successful in your practice. By carving out dedicated time for RPM, your team will quickly become very knowledgeable, learn what works well for your patients, and be comfortable carrying the processes you established forward.\n\nHow to Conduct an Onboarding Event\n\nBelow are the four key steps to planning and executing a successful RPM onboarding event.\n\nStep 1. Identify Potential RPM Patients\n\nThe patients you select will depend on the devices that you have chosen. It’s also important to think about your RPM goals and your practice’s patient population. For example, let’s say you are planning to monitor hypertensive patients with blood pressure devices. You should consider if you want to grow quickly and consider all patients with hypertension as RPM-eligible or prioritize those patients with the most need, such as patients with uncontrolled hypertension or patients that are non-compliant with their medication.\n\nInsurance coverage is also an important consideration. Medicare covers RPM but a patient without supplemental insurance may be responsible for copays. Many commercial insurers also cover RPM and your RPM provider should be able to provide an eligibility verification service.\n\nStep 2: Schedule RPM Appointments\n\nThe key to a successful onboarding event is getting a critical mass of patients onboarded to RPM in a short time frame. Depending on your practice, that could mean 20 patients or 50. This repetition of RPM onboarding in a single day means your team will have plenty of opportunities to practice talking to patients about RPM.\n\nTo achieve this, your staff (clinical or admin) must schedule at least one full day of appointments specifically for RPM onboarding. Your RPM partner should be able to provide a script that explains the benefits of RPM and includes answers to potential objections to facilitate scheduling.\n\nStep 3: Prepare for the Onboarding Event\n\nThe more setup that is completed in advance of the onboarding event, the smoother things will go. For example, collecting patient consent forms and RPM orders can avoid last-minute scrambles and delays while the patient is in the office.\n\nA crucial element of preparation is dedicating enough clinical staff for the onboarding event. We strongly recommend that your staff members conducting the onboarding event be 100% dedicated to RPM for the day(s) of the event.\n\nYour RPM customer success team should step-by-step coaching for your clinical staff before and during the onboarding event. Depending on the size of the onboarding event, they often attend the actual event at your clinic. They have seen what works and what doesn’t with patient onboarding and can provide guidance on setting up processes that will work for your practice.\n\nStep 4: Conduct RPM Appointments\n\nNow it’s time to conduct the actual onboarding appointment. This is the time to educate the patient about RPM and set expectations for their ongoing participation. When done well, the ongoing process sets the foundation for ongoing patient and engagement. Patients should leave the appointment feeling fully confident in how to use their device and understanding the expectations for regular readings and communication with your clinical staff.\n\nAfter conducting thousands of onboarding appointments, we are happy to share some practical, concrete, simple tips that can really make the difference between a good and great RPM experience for the patient.\n\nAfter Your Onboarding Event\n\nWhile the onboarding appointment is the time to set the patient up for success, it’s critical to keep the momentum going by starting monitoring outreach the very next day. If you are concerned that your staff does not have time to contact every RPM patient daily, consider managed RPM services that can act as an extension of your own clinical staff.\n\nWhile an onboarding event can give your program a quick ramp, it certainly isn’t the end of onboarding. Your practice is likely seeing many patients every day that can benefit from RPM. We recommend scanning upcoming appointments daily or weekly to identify potential RPM patients. Once those patients are flagged, an RPM onboarding can be added to their scheduled appointment.\n\nReady to Learn More?",
      "# [Remote Care Programs for Healthcare on 2023-11-24](https://optimize.health/who-we-serve/)\nPhysician practices\n\nA remote care program is attainable for small to mid-size practices because we’ve got you covered. Our remote patient monitoring software is easy to deploy and use. With our clinical monitoring services, your staff doesn’t have to take on more work. We can verify eligibility, onboard patients, deliver devices, monitor them with licensed nurses, and support billing needs.\n\nTracking patients with chronic diseases can make a difference in their health, with real-time information sent from devices to the platform. Chronic condition patients do see their physicians regularly. However, you don’t have visibility beyond the vitals you take at appointments and the patient’s symptoms update. Remote patient monitoring closes this gap with daily readings, which gives you more data to make the best treatment decisions. It supports continuity of care.\n\nValue-based care\n\nFor value-based care (VBC) organizations, remote patient monitoring is an essential tool to improve patient outcomes by linking reimbursement to the quality of care provided.\n\nRPM enables VBCs to provide quality care beyond exam rooms in several ways. It can play a key role in patient engagement and satisfaction improvements with regular contact between care providers and patients. Constant vitals monitoring delivers data to care teams, leading to better patient health, including lower blood pressure, weight loss, and more stable A1C numbers. It also maximizes clinical efficiency, allowing you to treat many patients remotely with the help of technology and clinical monitoring services.\n\nFQHCs\n\nFederally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) are part of the safety net for patient communities they may otherwise not have access to care. Your mission is to promote health and wellness to these populations, and remote care is an avenue to do this.\n\nRemote care programs offer great value for FQHCs and those they serve. Often, FQHCs have many chronic disease patients in their care. As a result, they need close monitoring of vitals and medication adherence. Beyond regular follow-up visits with physicians, FQHCs have little data that provides insights into the day-to-day management of their patients’ diseases.\n\nRPM can transform situations to deliver more connectedness and continuity of care. Such a program provides regular vital readings and regular communication between patients and care teams. Those interactions can be reminders to use their devices or take medications and answer patient questions. Additionally, if vitals become elevated, physicians get immediate notifications so they can intervene, which can reduce the need for emergency care and hospitalizations.\n\nHospitals and health systems\n\nA remote care program enables clinical outcome improvement at scale. No matter the size of your patient population, you can develop a plan that ensures equitable care, either with your staff or our team of licensed nurses.\n\nWith a program in place, it gives your health system a differentiator, enhancing patient engagement. Our remote patient monitoring platform is health system-ready, with tools to share data, track progress, and measure performance. Our solutions also support coding and billing.\n\nACOs\n\nAccountable Care Organizations (ACOs) can use RPM to better manage the most high-risk patients in their network. With the ability to monitor chronic conditions and take action immediately, the outcome is reduced hospitalizations and ED visits.\n\nA feature in our platform that ACOs attribute to the prevention of emergency care is the escalation framework. When critical readings occur, physicians can respond and intervene in the moment.\n\nThe healthcare data from the pool of patients empowers physicians in your group to have more insight into treatments and progression. They can then make proactive decisions more effectively.",

      "# [RPM Healthcare Christine Meyer Success on 2022-09-01](https://optimize.health/blog/christine-meyer-rpm/)\nChristine Meyer, MD and Associates, a 13-provider practice in the greater Philadelphia area, is committed to providing top quality, patient-centered care. Like many practices, they have a large number of patients with long-term chronic diseases, including hypertension and diabetes and are always looking for innovative ways to improve the care and quality of life for these patients.\n\nRPM is Good Medicine\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of treating patients with chronic diseases is managing their care between office visits. Before RPM, even when patients were taking their blood pressure at home, the providers at Christine Meyer, MD and Associates did not have access to the data.\n\nIn 2020, they launched remote patient monitoring (RPM) with Optimize Health to overcome this challenge. Their program has been extremely successful and now has over 450 patients. Lauren Marohn, the RPM lead, says, “RPM has allowed our patients to take control of their health, and they’re excited to see that their blood pressure or blood sugar is lower. RPM just allows us to deliver good medicine.”\n\nRPM as a Standard of Care\n\nChristine Meyer, MD and Associates have been so happy with the results that they now view RPM as a standard part of the care plan for their patients with hypertension and diabetes as well as those on weight loss programs.\n\nAll 13 of their providers are actively ordering RPM for patients. Providers engage with patients to set expectations for ongoing participation in RPM. They explain that RPM prevents hospitalizations, strokes, and other adverse events. Even when a patient’s readings are trending within range for a period of time, Christine Meyer, MD and Associates treats RPM as part of their permanent care plan. As Lauren reminds patients, “Hypertension is a silent killer.”\n\nDriving Patient Engagement with Optimize Health\n\nOnce patients are enrolled, Lauren uses the Optimize Health platform to prioritize her work each day. “The platform highlights which patients had critical readings so I know who needs help or to be called immediately. I can also view patients by conditions, last reading taken, or number of readings that month so I can see what to prioritize next.”\n\nA huge part of Christine Meyer’s success is Lauren’s trusted relationships with her patients. “I do a lot of patient outreach and I’ve become familiar with who needs more support. I had one patient whose blood pressure kept getting higher and higher, and so I immediately called her to come into the office, and we gave her meds, conducted a cardiac workup, and saved her from a hospitalization.”\n\nThe Future is Growth\n\nChristine Meyer’s plans for the program include focusing on ongoing engagement as well as growth. They want patients to truly understand how RPM prevents strokes and hospitalizations and can save lives.\n\nLauren’s goal is to continue to engage both providers and patients to grow the program. “I hope to someday have 900 patients enrolled in the program so that we keep delivering better care, and can save them from hospitalizations and unnecessary critical events.”\n\nReady to Be the Next RPM Success Story?",

      "# [Why Switch RPM Vendors and When To Do So on 2022-07-05](https://optimize.health/blog/switch-rpm-vendors/)\nRemote patient monitoring has evolved significantly since CMS first introduced the reimbursement codes in 2019. Patient awareness and interest in remote monitoring is growing. Clinical research has continued to demonstrate the effectiveness of RPM in improving outcomes for multiple conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, and heart failure. Congress has continued to invest in telehealth, expanding remote monitoring with the addition of remote therapeutic monitoring.\n\nYet, despite all this good news, many practices who understand the value of RPM are still struggling to make it work. They identified a significant number of patients that could benefit from RPM, but devices are sitting unused on shelfs. Many practices didn’t fully understand the staff time required for remote monitoring. Others lacked support from their RPM vendor to get the program launched successfully. And some find it difficult to get patients to engage and take their readings.\n\nIf your RPM program isn’t quite living up to your expectations, it may be time to reevaluate your RPM partner. RPM partners are no longer just about selecting the right software — it’s about a full solution of services that meet your needs now and in the future. We’ve identified three challenges that have led practices to start searching for a new remote patient monitoring solution as well as questions to ask potential new vendors.\n\nA Plan for Staffing\n\nThe most common challenge we see among practices struggling to maintain and grow their RPM programs is staffing. Most practices don’t have clinical staff with spare free time to invest in RPM. And many RPM vendors fail to adequately explain just how much staff is needed for both RPM onboarding and ongoing monitoring.\n\nThis is exactly why we always start with a success plan (before you sign a contract). The success plan outlines the roles, responsibilities, and time commitments of your staff who will make up your internal RPM team. It also covers your goals and guidance on how to measure progress against them.\n\nRemote patient monitoring software must be intuitive, easy to learn, and simple to use with minimal instruction so your team isn’t wasting time “figuring it out.” Many RPM vendors will offer software training, but software training is really just the starting point. A great RPM partner will teach your team how to optimize every part of the RPM journey including patient identification, consent, enrollment, monitoring, billing, support, etc.\n\nAnd if you don’t have enough resources to fulfill those functions, your RPM partner needs to provide a customized solution for your team. That could include creating a hiring plan for new staff or conducting the onboarding or monitoring with outsourced RPM services.\n\nClinical Expertise\n\nA great monitoring solution will use licensed nurses that have the expertise to assess patients with confidence and competence, which minimizes false escalations. But, they will collaborate with your team on treatment plans and escalation policies, so they feel like part of your own staff.\n\nLikewise, outsourced remote onboarding can reduce the burden on your staff by managing all the logistics of onboarding, including effective onboarding appointments.\n\nQuestions to Ask When Evaluating Your RPM Vendor\n\nHow much staff do I need for RPM now and in the future?\n\nHow much time is my staff spending using the software? Is it easy and intuitive?\n\nHow effective and comprehensive has our staff training been?\n\nDo you offer an outsourced monitoring service?\n\nWhat are the credentials of your outsourced staff?\n\nHow does your monitoring team create treatment plans and escalation policies?\n\nHow does your monitoring staff communicate with our team and maintain our approach to treating patients?\n\nDo you offer remote onboarding services?\n\nPatient Engagement\n\nLow patient adherence is the second-most common reason why RPM programs are unsuccessful. Beyond having enough staff to regularly communicate with patients, there are several other factors that impact patient engagement.\n\nDevices: Devices need to be easy to use from the perspective of your patient population. While Bluetooth apps may work for some patients, seniors often prefer cellular devices. Cellular devices are as simple to use as non-connected devices, so they will already be familiar to many patients. With a cellular blood pressure cuff, you press one button to take your reading and automatically transmit the data. With a cellular weight scale, you simply step on and step off — that’s it. Cellular devices also reduce potential financial barriers as patients do not need a smartphone, computer, or internet connection. A strong RPM partner should offer both cellular and Bluetooth options to meet the needs of your patient population.\n\nCommunication and reminders: To make it easier for your clinical staff to engage with patients, the best RPM software has built-in communication tools that allow them to text, call, and video chat with patients in one-click. The software should also have automated reminders about readings that can be configured to each patient’s schedule. This ensures the reminders are welcome and helpful, not annoying and intrusive.\n\nEffective onboarding: The onboarding appointment is a critical time to educate your patients about the importance of their participation and set expectations for their engagement. Your RPM partner should be supporting your team with an Onboarding Event that can not only jump start your program, but also teach your team how to conduct effective onboarding. Your RPM partner should also provide coaching on how to talk to patients about RPM and help you create onboarding processes that work for your practice.\n\nQuestions to Ask When Evaluating Your RPM Vendor\n\nHow many patients are taking the required 16 days of readings per month?\n\nDoes our staff find it easy to engage with patients in the software?\n\nAre we meeting our patient retention goals (and did our RPM vendor help us set them before we started)?\n\nDoes our RPM vendor offer both cellular and Bluetooth devices?\n\nHow often are patients reporting issues with their devices or connected technology?\n\nHow does our RPM vendor support the patient onboarding process?\n\nOverall, are our patients satisfied with RPM? Has it strengthened our provider-patient relationship?\n\nCan I do in-person onboarding myself and remote onboarding simultaneously?\n\nIf I’m using remote onboarding, how does my partner ensure remote onboarding appointments are as effective as in-person?\n\nClient Success and Supporting Services\n\nA strong RPM partner supports you and your patients at every step of their journey. Most companies offer customer service — reactively responding to questions and issues. But, does your RPM partner provide true client success? Are they regularly sharing data and best practices before problems arise? Are you having ongoing conversations about your goals and how to reach them?\n\nA strong client success team starts with a success plan, has dedicated implementation experts to help you launch effectively, and provides regular business reviews. They understand that RPM is just one of many services that you offer. And it may not always be your number one priority.\n\nAs your RPM program grows, you may need more support or different workflows. Your RPM partner should have a flexible solution that can adapt when your needs change. This ensures you can add services as you need them while controlling which parts of the RPM process you manage versus outsource.\n\nSupporting services that a strong RPM solution should offer (but not require that you use) include:\n\nOutsourcing monitoring\n\nOnsite and remote onboarding\n\nInsurance eligibility verification\n\nEHR integration\n\nQuestions to Ask When Evaluating Your RPM Vendor\n\nIs our RPM vendor proactively helping us grow and meet our goals?\n\nDo we even have established RPM goals?\n\nHow often do we evaluate data on key metrics, such as patient growth, patient adherence rates, and patient engagement?Can we easily access that data?\n\nDid our RPM vendor help us create effective onboarding processes? Are they still working today?\n\nDoes our RPM vendor offer other services that we may need now or in the future?\n\nDo they truly understand our needs and pain points to help us create a strong RPM program?\n\nIs it Time to Reevaluate your RPM Program?\n\nRemote patient monitoring can seem complex, but it doesn’t have to be. A great RPM partner can make monitoring easy, safe, effective, and profitable.\n\nIf your RPM program is struggling to grow or not living up to your expectations, set up a free consultation with one of RPM experts.

      "# [Research: RPM and A1C Level Reduction on 2022-04-21](https://optimize.health/blog/clinical-research-a1c/)\nMany diabetic patients already take blood sugar readings on a daily basis. With the rapid increase in the adoption of telehealth and Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM), many studies are investigating if utilizing RPM to share patient blood glucose levels with clinicians can lead to lower A1C levels.\n\nResearch Supports the Role of Remote Patient Monitoring in Reducing A1C for Diabetic Patients\n\nRemote Patient Monitoring (RPM) provides instantaneous access to blood glucose data before and after patient meals and activities. This creates a complete feedback loop for collecting and analyzing data, adjusting behaviors, and modifying treatment to improve outcomes.\n\nRPM enables more data analysis, structured health coaching, and timely interventions that lead to better A1C management than patient self-monitoring. In addition to improving treatment outcomes in diabetic patients, studies have indicated RPM can boost prevention in pre-diabetic patients.\n\nWe understand that healthcare providers need to direct their limited resources to programs that have been clinically proven to positively impact patient outcomes. As such, we compiled and synthesized fifteen (15) studies that scientifically demonstrate how RPM can help diabetic and pre-diabetic patients.\n\nHighlights of the Research Include:\n\nConsistent Results with Optimize Health Outcomes\n\nOptimize Health’s clients using Remote Patient Monitoring to manage blood glucose have produced results consistent with the clinical research. Diabetic patients have experienced an average 4.5 drop in A1C within 4.5 months.\n\nHow to Use the RPM Diabetes Research\n\nPhysicians and ordering providers rely on the results of clinical research studies every day to make patient care decisions.

      "# [Tips on Talking to Patients About RPM on 2022-01-31](https://optimize.health/blog/talking-about-rpm/)\nThe number of patients interested in telehealth is skyrocketing. One study shows that 76 percent are interested in telehealth now compared to just 11 percent in 2019. And 74 percent of telehealth users report higher levels of satisfaction with their healthcare. That said, Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) is still a new concept for some patients. In fact, the patients that could likely benefit from RPM the most – older, less tech-savvy patients with multiple chronic conditions – may be the most resistant to new programs and technologies. So, how do you discuss with a hesitant patient, especially one that may be concerned about co-pays for RPM, that an RPM program may be beneficial for their care?\n\nTaking the Patients Point of View\n\nWhen discussing RPM with patients, you may be tempted to focus only on explaining the clinical research supporting remote monitoring. While the research is compelling, we also strongly recommend making it a point to keep the conversation as relevant to their everyday life and their specific health challenges as possible.\n\nThe more personalized the RPM discussion is, the more likely it is that a patient will understand the benefits and alternatives to participating in an RPM program and want to take next steps to actively participate in the program. Well-designed patient education materials can help guide live conversations about remote monitoring. However, once a provider determines that a patient is a good candidate for an RPM program, it’s important for the care team to make sure the patient completely understands the benefits and risks of the program so they can make an informed choice to say yes when it’s a good fit.\n\nWhat Should I Say to Patients?\n\nWe recommend trying to see the benefits of RPM through the patient’s eyes. Focus on how RPM may:\n\nImprove their health\n\nExample: High blood pressure can create complications like heart disease or stroke. Taking your blood pressure every day can help us adjust your medications and support you in making healthy lifestyle choices that may keep you out of the hospital and emergency room.\n\nAllow them to take control of their health\n\nExample: Using this device helps put you in charge of your own health. You don’t have to wait until your next office appointment to monitor your health. Daily readings help you and us manage your chronic condition more proactively. By better managing your symptoms, you may enjoy a better quality of life.\n\nProvide them with the comfort and convenience of daily clinical check-ins\n\nExample: If you worry about living by yourself with a chronic condition, RPM may help. A trained clinical care team member will be looking at your data and checking in on you daily or as needed to make sure you are feeling Ok. If you have family members that worry about you, this may provide comfort and reassurance to them as well.\n\nMake their life easier\n\nExample: If you have a chronic condition, such as hypertension and diabetes, you may already be taking regular readings. With RPM, you can stop writing down your readings on paper and trying to make sense of what to do if you have a high or low reading. A trained clinical care team member will be reviewing your data to help you and us make decisions about your care.\n\nHelp them financially\n\nExample: Whether it’s a visit to a hospital, admission to a nursing home, or even more prescription medication, if your condition worsens, it may be costly. Your device may save you money by helping to reduce the high costs of treating health problems versus preventing them.\n\nThe Patient Said Yes to RPM, Now What?\n\nIf the patient has agreed to participate, they will need an onboarding appointment. Education and setting expectations are key to successful onboarding. We want to make sure patients leave the onboarding appointment confident they know how to use their device. They also need to understand the importance of taking regular readings according to their clinical needs and plan of care and regular engagement with your care team.\n\nReady to Learn More?\n\nIf you have questions or want to learn more, please schedule a free consultation with one of our RPM experts. We are happy to share more details on the potential clinical and financial benefits of RPM. We also have additional resources on how to successfully onboard RPM patients.\n\nRead Next\n\nRPM, RTM, CCM, PCM – Which Remote Care Program is Right for Your Patients?\n\nThe pandemic didn’t create remote care, but it has greatly accelerated the adoption of telehealth and remote care.\n\nRead More",
      "# [RPM and CCM Are Perfect Complements on 2022-08-23](https://optimize.health/blog/using-rpm-ccm/)\nThe Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) introduced Chronic Care Management (CCM) in 2015 to reimburse providers for non-face-to-face services between office visits. The intent was to improve outcomes and reduce costs of caring for patients with chronic conditions with ongoing, remote care coordination. CCM is designed for patients that have two or more chronic conditions expected to last at least 12 months that put the patient at significant risk. 86% of Americans over the age of 65 have two or more chronic conditions, implying that most Medicare patients could be eligible for CCM.\n\nCCM Proven Effective\n\nCMS has demonstrated that care coordination is effective. Their claims analysis demonstrated that CCM:\n\nWith these results, it’s no surprise that CMS has increased reimbursement on several CCM CPT® codes, including a 55% increase for CPT code 99490, which reimburses the first 20 minutes of clinical staff time and a 29% increase for CPT code 99439, which covers additional 20 minute increments of clinical staff time.\n\nWhat Makes a Good CCM Program?\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Family Medicine (AAFP), a strong CCM program drives value by “delivering continuous, comprehensive, and connected health care.”\n\nThe value of remote care programs is engaging with your patients on a more regular basis between office visits. Medical Economics concludes that a CCM program combined with remote patient monitoring (RPM), behavioral health integration (BHI), and other services can “provide patients with timelier, more personalized, and highly efficient remote care.”\n\nIf a prevention plan is at the heart of a CCM program, what better way to ensure that prevention plan is working and up-to-date than with daily or regular vital sign monitoring? That’s exactly what RPM can do as a complement to your CCM program. RPM provides unique access to more patient data without putting the burden of manually tracking readings on the patients.\n\nHaving real-time access to trends in blood pressure, weight, blood sugar, or blood oxygenation can help inform a care team on how to manage chronic conditions.\n\nRPM + CCM Makes Clinical and Financial Sense\n\nNot only do RPM and CCM complement each other clinically, they also work together financially. Because each service has its own set of CPT® Codes, practices can bill for both services. However, they cannot count the same minutes of clinician time towards both services.\n\nIn addition, RPM does not require a specific diagnosis like CCM does, so there may be patients that are eligible for RPM that are not eligible for CCM.\n\nOvercoming Barriers to Remote Care\n\nWhile thousands of healthcare providers have incorporated remote care into their practice, many others have understandable concerns about the barriers to remote care adoption. Some are taking a more selective approach to remote care, even though patients want more options that provide quality and convenience.\n\nOf all the remote care options, remote monitoring can overcome many of the perceived barriers of telehealth.\n\nAre you Ready to Enhance your CCM Program?",
      "# [What Staff Do You Need for an RPM Program on 2022-02-09](https://optimize.health/blog/how-much-staff/)\nMost practices start Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) programs with the intent to provide proactive, preventative care. Monitoring patients between office visits enables timely interventions and educational opportunities that improve patient outcomes. This requires clinical staff time to monitor daily readings, engage with patients, and provide ongoing education which can be challenging in today’s world of staffing shortages.\n\nOne of the most frequent questions we get asked by practices considering RPM, is “How much time will this take my staff?” Likewise, we also see a lot of practices that could provide significant benefit to their patients with RPM opt not to because they don’t have the clinical staff. Fortunately, we can help you plan for clinical staffing and provide solutions if you feel like you don’t have enough clinical staff.\n\nHow Much Clinical Staff Do I Actually Need?\n\nYour RPM clinical monitoring staff should be prepared to engage with your RPM patients regularly, as determined by patient need and clinical protocols. Adding RPM responsibilities to your already stretched-thin clinical staff could lead to insufficient engagement.\n\nIn our experience, one full-time dedicated clinical staff member may be able to monitor between 150 – 200 patients, depending on the nature and complexity of the patients’ needs. Smaller RPM programs may choose to dedicate a partial FTE, but it’s critical that you allocate the right number of hours for RPM to meet the needs of your patients.\n\nA staffing calculator can be a very helpful tool in planning for RPM resources. Depending on the clinical needs of your patients, 150 patients per full-time care team member (CTM) is a good starting point to adjust up or down from. If your patient population is more acute or has more complicated conditions, you may need to assign fewer patients to each clinical staff member. The experience and credentials of your CTMs can also impact staffing your clinical monitoring team.\n\nSample RPM Clinical Staffing Estimates\n\nKeep in mind that 20 minutes of engagement time are required to bill for the 99457 CPT® code. Depending on patient acuity and treatment plans and goals, some patients may benefit from incremental segments of engagement time. In addition, 16-days of data transmission are required for the 99454 CPT® code.\n\nIn addition, regular interaction with patients may increase the number of patients taking regular readings. and therefore eligibility for the 99454 CPT® code for 16-days of data transmission.\n\nIt’s important to note that your RPM staffing needs will likely change over time as your program grows. If you are planning for growth, you should be ready to flex and increase your RPM resources.\n\nWhat if I Don’t Have that Much Clinical Staff Time?\n\nMany practices don’t have an extra clinical staff member with no or minimal responsibilities that they can easily allocate to RPM. Many practices will need to consider hiring additional clinical staff or outsourcing the monitoring to make RPM as successful as possible. The potential benefits of expanding your practice to include RPM often outweigh the investment in RPM clinical staffing expenses. Your RPM partner should help you conduct a simple Return on Investment analysis that will justify the expense of either option below.\n\nWhile it may feel like you are forfeiting some control with partner-managed clinical monitoring, a strong vendor will act as an extension of your own clinical staff. Outsourcing clinical monitoring has several potential key advantages:\n\nWith partner-managed clinical monitoring, your practice will still need to have the resources available to manage patient escalations and patient interventions, such as changes to medication and treatment plans. This also helps ensure your practice retains control of the patient’s overall health and progress towards their goals.\n\nMaking the Right Clinical Staffing Decision for Your Practice\n\nThe first step in determining which solution is right for you is using the RPM clinical staffing calculator to estimate the resources you need. Then, compare the projected clinical staffing needs to your team’s current workload and availability. With that information, you can weigh the complete pros and cons to self-managed versus partner-managed RPM programs.",
      "# [RPM Healthcare Christine Meyer Success on 2022-09-01](https://optimize.health/blog/christine-meyer-rpm/)\nChristine Meyer, MD and Associates, a 13-provider practice in the greater Philadelphia area, is committed to providing top quality, patient-centered care. Like many practices, they have a large number of patients with long-term chronic diseases, including hypertension and diabetes and are always looking for innovative ways to improve the care and quality of life for these patients.\n\nRPM is Good Medicine\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of treating patients with chronic diseases is managing their care between office visits. Before RPM, even when patients were taking their blood pressure at home, the providers at Christine Meyer, MD and Associates did not have access to the data.\n\nIn 2020, they launched remote patient monitoring (RPM) with Optimize Health to overcome this challenge. Their program has been extremely successful and now has over 450 patients. Lauren Marohn, the RPM lead, says, “RPM has allowed our patients to take control of their health, and they’re excited to see that their blood pressure or blood sugar is lower. RPM just allows us to deliver good medicine.”\n\nRPM as a Standard of Care\n\nChristine Meyer, MD and Associates have been so happy with the results that they now view RPM as a standard part of the care plan for their patients with hypertension and diabetes as well as those on weight loss programs.\n\nAll 13 of their providers are actively ordering RPM for patients. Providers engage with patients to set expectations for ongoing participation in RPM. They explain that RPM prevents hospitalizations, strokes, and other adverse events. Even when a patient’s readings are trending within range for a period of time, Christine Meyer, MD and Associates treats RPM as part of their permanent care plan. As Lauren reminds patients, “Hypertension is a silent killer.”\n\nDriving Patient Engagement with Optimize Health\n\nOnce patients are enrolled, Lauren uses the Optimize Health platform to prioritize her work each day. “The platform highlights which patients had critical readings so I know who needs help or to be called immediately. I can also view patients by conditions, last reading taken, or number of readings that month so I can see what to prioritize next.”\n\nA huge part of Christine Meyer’s success is Lauren’s trusted relationships with her patients. “I do a lot of patient outreach and I’ve become familiar with who needs more support. I had one patient whose blood pressure kept getting higher and higher, and so I immediately called her to come into the office, and we gave her meds, conducted a cardiac workup, and saved her from a hospitalization.”\n\nThe Future is Growth\n\nChristine Meyer’s plans for the program include focusing on ongoing engagement as well as growth. They want patients to truly understand how RPM prevents strokes and hospitalizations and can save lives.\n\nLauren’s goal is to continue to engage both providers and patients to grow the program. “I hope to someday have 900 patients enrolled in the program so that we keep delivering better care, and can save them from hospitalizations and unnecessary critical events.”\n\nReady to Be the Next RPM Success Story?",

Tell me about your experiences.\n\n## Comment ID kaqx4j5 with +273 score by [(kindaretiredguy, Reddit, 2023-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/183srcl/who_do_you_work_with_to_optimize_your_health/kaqx4j5/) (in reply to ID 183srcl):\nI come from this space (started and sold a nutrition coaching company that provided simple advice). Gary is a known charlatan and is looked down on by most of the evidence based people. All you need is advice like in Attia’s book at this point. So many people with money are being duped by these biohackers pushing non sense. \n\nHere’s my advice that I would give to everyone. Step one is not to be overweight (tons of health issues come from it), workout (lift and do cardio), eat decently (various foods with nutrients and not stressing too much about the things you enjoy- with one caveat. You must be able to moderate the fun stuff, and it should not be preventing weight loss or causing weight gain), reduce stress, have a community. \n\nYou absolutely do not need to overspend for this advice. What you might want to spent on is sticking to that advice via accountability, but any decent trainer or rd/nutritionist should be able to provide that.\n\n### Comment ID kastruq with +107 score by [(Activate_The_Robots, Reddit, 2023-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/183srcl/who_do_you_work_with_to_optimize_your_health/kastruq/) (in reply to ID kaqx4j5):\nThe number of posts in this subreddit asking how to buy or secret-hack their health is astonishing.\n\n**The answer, always:** lose weight, be more active, get good sleep, stop eating double-cheeseburgers for breakfast, reduce your stress and spend more time with your family. \n\n**The response, always:** Yeah, but I have *money*.\n\n🤦🏼‍♂️\n\n#### Comment ID katwapw with +14 score by [(kindaretiredguy, Reddit, 2023-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/183srcl/who_do_you_work_with_to_optimize_your_health/katwapw/) (in reply to ID kastruq):\nRight?

No amount of money can force you to do it… it makes it easier but it won’t fix it if you don’t do the work yourself. A few things I’ve found that helps:\n\n- Stop eating crappy food. I’m not saying you need to buy all organic but if you’re buying a sandwich default to a place that makes great bread vs a subway. \n\n- Make moving around a consistent part of your life. I HATE driving. I take public transit or bike my kids everywhere. If you live someplace where cars are the mandatory way to get around then move (this is fatFIRE). The act of walking is going to help a ton vs a sedentary life style.\n\n- Take up a hobby that is a physical activity. I started playing tennis a few years ago and the results are noticeable. Before that it was rock climbing. I also ski. If all of this is beyond your abilities get a trainer and commit (no amount of money will force you).\n\n- You don’t need to take alcohol to zero but limit to a few days a week in moderate amounts. If you over do it every other month that’s fine. If you’re drinking a dozen miller lites on a Saturday on your boat then why are you even posting this question?\n\nStop falling for easy fixes by throwing money at it and fix your life.\n\nEdit: The comment about driving doesn’t apply to everyone. There are plenty of people in shape that live in areas where driving is a necessity. They focus on moving/being active in other ways. If you can’t do that for yourself this is a fix.\n\n### Comment ID katqyh3 with +9 score by [(fsapds, Reddit, 2023-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/183srcl/who_do_you_work_with_to_optimize_your_health/katqyh3/) (in reply to ID kaqx4j5):\nSleep, sir, you forgot sleep\n\n#### Comment ID katw4l4 with +6 score by [(kindaretiredguy, Reddit, 2023-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/183srcl/who_do_you_work_with_to_optimize_your_health/katw4l4/) (in reply to ID katqyh3):\nI feel like an idiot because that’s so obvious and what I talk about with people lol.\n\n### Comment ID kasvq7w with +3 score by [(LifeLongLearnr, Reddit, 2023-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/183srcl/who_do_you_work_with_to_optimize_your_health/kasvq7w/) (in reply to ID kaqx4j5):\nI am bookmarking this.\n\n### Comment ID kavd4fb with +2 score by [(JLHtard, Reddit, 2023-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/183srcl/who_do_you_work_with_to_optimize_your_health/kavd4fb/) (in reply to ID kaqx4j5):\nWhat I found what worked for me: 80% of the time healthy lifestyle (at least 5 out of 7 days moving your body decently) + the same for eating and drinking.

I am very knowledge when it comes to health and sports because I enjoy it, not because I make a living of it. So I try to give advice. What I do: \n\n\nI do biyearly check ups at my doctor getting my blood work done, gynecology, … \n\nAlso dentist every 3 months for a check up, I think dental care is very important! \n\nI do also visit my physical therapist once a week to identify some weak points in my muscle system. This is very important for your posture and health especially when getting older! The weight your muscles carry doesn’t need to be carried completely by your spine, joints,.. \n\nEspecially as I love wearing heels on a daily basis(which is unhealthy) I focus on trying to have my muscles be ready to take the extra impact. \n\nOther than that just work out regularly, doesn’t need to be anything specific dedicated to health, consistency is KEY, so it has to be something you enjoy! (That is VERY important) working out for a year is good, but doing it for decades in a healthy amount is what you are really looking for. \n\nWhen it comes to food it also depends on what you can do so you enjoy it enough to stay consistent right? A 60% healthy diet over a lifespan is better than eating 100% for 3 years and then get tired and just be at 0% for the next 40 years. \n\nI just try to stay away from processed food, sugar, sweets. I try to roughly keep my macros under control (talking about approximately 1,5g fat/kg bodyweight, 2g protein/kg bodyweight and the rest carbohydrates) I have our household lady stick to these values and track my food when she cooks for me and just use organic food. \n\nIf I am eating out I just eat what I want, because as I said I want it to be as comfortable and easy to maintain to do it over my lifespan. \n\nThings like not just sleeping 3 hours a night, smoking and drinking lots of alcohol are just things you have to think about. Of course they are unhealthy. I know I repeat myself, but to consistent once again. \nBetter drink a glas of wine when going out, instead of trying to do a 0 alcohol policy but carving for it and have wild outbursts every few years. If you are not prone for it some people do a 0 alcohol policy without any problems at all, so that’s individual \n\nI think if you do all that you a perfectly fine with what you can do, the rest is not to be influenced.\n\n## Comment ID kaquph1 with +34 score by [(ShitPostGuy, Reddit, 2023-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/183srcl/who_do_you_work_with_to_optimize_your_health/kaquph1/) (in reply to ID 183srcl):\nIn my experience, there is always someone willing to add on flashing lights and wooshing noises to every basic service and charge you 100x the price for it.

I’ve been a bit obsessed with the topic, especially since retiring in my mid 30s with a lot of time. \n\nBasically mastering the basics (mental, exercise, food) is most of it - even though it’s human nature to look externally for other people/programs etc to make it perfect. Educating yourself on general health is important. But really 90% of it is in your control and comes down to eating healthfully and as close to whole natural foods as possible with a lot of variety, exercise regularly, move your body in different ways frequently, stretch, limit alcohol, don’t smoke, limit stress, have purpose/community …… that is all in your control (and what I spend a good chunk of change on annually) and will get you very, very far.\n\nBeyond that there are smaller things you can do like concierge doctor (I chose against this), full body annual MRI cancer scans (also chose against this), regular vit b shots etc (I do sometimes but get most of what I need from diverse diet), or something like the GRAIL test that’s a simple blood test screening for 50+ cancers (I do it annually simply bc it’s low barrier/very simple with just a blood draw but understand it’s not fully accurate and also get the regular annual screenings).\n\nDepends on where you’re starting with your health journey. When I became interested in how to use my wealth to optimize longevity, I was already in a good spot (regular exercise, ate healthy, etc), so I made some tweaks here and there and am always reading/listening for new ideas and actual research. I’m generally interested in food science so it’s a hobby I’d say more than something that rules my world. If you’re at the very start of your health journey, sure… get a fancy trainer, nutritionist and outsource someone making your food/teaching you. I spend 5-7 hrs every Sunday food prepping all meals/snacks for the week and I honestly feel it’s added many years to my life/how I feel. Take the choice out. \n\nBooks like Peter Attia’s Outlive (there are many similar) are great. He gets very sciency/technical because he’s a total geek on the topic but I enjoy listening to him while I cook. \n\nI finally realized the excess stress I had trying to “perfect” longevity when I’d gotten myself 90%+ there with good choices was probably only going to deduct years from my life so I’ve settled into my routine and stopped looking for major optimizations proactively (like I said - I’m always reading/listening as it’s a hobby but I don’t stress on it).\n\nHope there was something valuable in there. But godddamn do I want to live a long time healthfully so I can hike mountains with my kids (who I had later in life as I was focused on wealth accumulation).

You can ask your doctor to write a script for it or I went to a local wellness clinic that had doctors on board. Go to the grail website and should show you providers or google grail and your city. It’s about $1K. I started a couple years ago and get it annually. Only recommended for 50+ who have cancer in their family but I have excess funds so just do it as an extra data point.\n\n### Comment ID katlbxg with +3 score by [(faken0ob, Reddit, 2023-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/183srcl/who_do_you_work_with_to_optimize_your_health/katlbxg/) (in reply to ID kaqvgiu):\nThanks you for sharing.

I’ve recently been focused on this part of my journey after “sprinting” non-stop in career hero mode for 10+ years.  I’m now 44/M for reference.\n\n1.  Get your data.  How on earth are you going to measure progress unless you have your data benchmarked when you start.  This is a full blood panel, it will cost you a grand.  Just do it.\n\n2.  Get a concierge doctor.  If you are a male and you live in the US, you are very likely NOT doing any kind of regular medical check-up / physical?  Why?  Because our healthcare system sucks and you have to sit in a waiting room with SICK people while you wait for some grumpy receptionist to call your name even though you showed up on time / early just for a doc to spend 4-5 minutes with you.  My concierge physician spends an hour at a time with me, we sit down in her office and talk to one another like any other professionals would.  I have learned so much.\n\n3.  Your concierge doctor will refer you to the best specialists.  She referred me to get a Calcium CT scan which is the number one predictor of cardiac arrest.  Score of 0-400 and lower is better.  She did this out of an abundance of caution when I told her about Sheryl Sandberg’s husband who was around my age and dropped dead on a treadmill in Hawaii.  I was worried.  The test was less than $200 and I’m all good to go as hard as I want.\n\n4.  I go to a high end men’s performance clinic and get the following: Testosterone, HCG, Mounjaro and an anti-estrogen.  They also prescribed a very low dose of cialis to use as a pre workout to enable better blood flow to my muscles.  Who knew?\n\n5.  I use another doctor for a Vyvanse prescription to combat binge eating.\n\n6.  I sleep like an absolute baby because my spouse has gone all out with our bed and bedding.  I think we have six functional pillows on the bed and we use all of them every night.  Down comforter, high thread count sheets and a really nice, firm mattress.  The bed itself is high quality and uhhhhh… sturdy.\n\n7.  I’ve hired two personal trainers, one is the secondary conditioning coach for many of the NFL players in my city.  He’s a good dude but sometimes pushes me a bit too hard and I was out with a tweaked back for a week.  I’m 44 not 24 bro!\n\nThe other personal trainer is a female pro bodybuilder, she knows how to sculpt and shape.\n\n8.  I have 200g of chicken breasts prepped for consumption every day (this is like four large chicken breasts), I also drink Koia shakes.  Sooooo gooooooooood (and non dairy.)\n\n9.  Lots of water.  Like try for two gallons.  Our city is above an aquifer and we have wonderful water right out of the tap, we just filter it with our refrigerator door filter / dispenser whatever.  This is definitely a struggle to get in.  Honestly I fail most days here.\n\n10.  This is the most important, your reference group.  If you hang out with overweight / obese people you will be obese.  Same with fit people.\n\nMy son is a famous entertainer that lives and works in Beverly Hills.  He is trained by the guy that the studios use to build actors into superheroes.  He motivated my change and is kind to me when I stumble.  He’s a year into it and has made amazingly impressive progress.\n\nHe put me on his supplement stack.  If there’s interest I can post it here.\n\nMy best friend and his son are also on the fitness journey now.  So, build this journey into the hearts and minds of your reference group and it will be automagic.\n\nGood luck!\n\n### Comment ID kavfhs4 with +1 score by [(DougyTwoScoops, Reddit, 2023-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/183srcl/who_do_you_work_with_to_optimize_your_health/kavfhs4/) (in reply to ID kau21tp):\nI’m interested in your supplement stack.

What are the specific FATfire means you take to optimize your longevity and quality of life? I will start it off with things that range from common sense to things that work for me. However, those are primarily budget-friendly so I want to hear your Fatfire suggestions- things like longevity clinics that focus on preventive medicine through regular screenings and advising on how to optimize health through diet, supplementation, lifestyle and risk factors. Im into things like the Huberman Podcast,\n\nCommon-Sense Stuff:\n\n\\-Exercise... basically as much as possible as far as I can tell cardio + strength training. If exercise is a huge chore for you do what you enjoy and what you can and don't beat yourself up about it. What is the fatfire approach to this during aging?\n\n\\-Diet: Whole non-processed foods, fruits veggies and not industrially produced meats. lots of leafy greens, not a lot of carbs especially the processed bullshit in the states, avoid sugar, avoid processed seed oils, have a caloric restriction for yourself, and stick to it, especially at specific times.\n\n\\-Fasting: Seems to be pretty important with the principal rule is don't always be eating\n\n\\-Have a strong social circle. A super underrated one that probably alludes people. Seek people through common interests and shared values. Community breeds purpose.\n\n\\-Purpose: Purpose breeds positive emotions\n\n\\-Mental health\n\n\\-Sleep optimization: How do fatfire folks optimize their sleep? I have terrible insomnia but understand the importance of sleep. Some common sense sleep approaches: avoid blue light at night, exercise, cool bedroom, breathe through your nose during rest and at all times, have a very dark sleeping area that is cool, Huberman's light exposure circadian stuff- aka get outside in the AM upon waking, as much as possible during the day, and at sunset. So basically go outside.\n\n\\-Outdoor Exposure: Is proven to improve health outcomes and gratitude.\n\n\\-Gratitude: Apparantly literally changes your brain like meditation.\n\n\\-Meditation: Expands your mind like breathing exercises\n\n\\-Breathing exercises: These have really worked for me and seem to be increasing in popularity. There seem to be two kinds IMHO uppers and downers. Exercises to upregulate your nervouse system and exercise to downregulate- use them respectively to get more awake and in your body and alert or to calm and relax and less alert.\n\n\\-Cold & Heat Exposure: I love both cold exposure and sauna and firmly believe in the associated health and wellness benefits. I consider them positive stressors- health optimization isn't about minimizing stressors. In fact, humans are considered anti-fragile whereby the system becomes more resilient in response to stress. However, chronic stress of a negative and environmental kind must be avoided at all costs- they will ruin you and destroy your health and well-being. Interestingly, an apparent key factor in how to determine if a stressor is positive or negative is your mindset. When I get into cold water I tell myself that it's for my own well-being and therefore it is, and even the though first part always sucks I wouldn't trade it for anything, and the endorphin rush after and during is amazing.\n\n\\-Positive Stressor Maximaztion & Negative/ Chronic Stress Minimization: Find some positive stressors that you can leverage \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome Random Things Not To Do Before We Get Into FatFire Ideas:\n\n\\-Smoke tobacco\n\n\\-Drink in Excess\n\n\\-Be Overweight\n\n\\-Use motor vehicles with extreme caution and never drive drunk\n\n\\-Use hard drugs\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFatfire?\n\n\\-Executive physicals (?)\n\n\\-Screenings for common diseases (could people specify exactly what these would be?)\n\n\\-Genetic Testing (what specifically should one be aware of in this space? Are services like 23andme etc good enough or no? If not, what would you recommend)\n\n\\-Dentist, dermatologist, regular physicals\n\n\\-Wearables (do these things actually help at this point are apple watch, oura ring, ect there yet?)\n\n\\-Regular blood testing(does anyone have experience with services like insidetrtacker or a suggestion in this area?)\n\n\\-Supplementation: I don't really even know where to start with this one, especially for people who are aging... I take an occasional multi-vitamin and but never know if it's \n\n\\-Healthy Hobbies & Passions: Things that you enjoy doing and optimize health and ideally are outdoors are just a win win win- share you fatfire hobbies that keep you fit, healthy, and excited to go outside.\n\n## Comment ID innnsl4 with +159 score by [(Romanticon, Reddit, 2022-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/innnsl4/) (in reply to ID x922ci):\nAs someone who is HENRY and in the biotech space, with a background (PhD) in this sort of stuff, I think you have a ton of great items listed here.  My thoughts:\n\n**The good:**\n\n1. Diet.  Single biggest driver of health.  FatFIRE add-on: private chef or meal prep service if you're not interested in cooking or don't want to put in the time to ensure that meals (and portion sizes!) are healthy.\n2. Exercise.  Close behind diet as the single biggest driver of health.  FatFIRE add-on: home gym and/or personal trainer to help ensure that it becomes a very regular habit and make sure that all major muscle groups are targeted.\n3. Mental aspects (social circle, meditating, calmness, good attitude): all important.  FatFIRE add-on: you can definitely help ensure that there's adequate bonding time by offering to foot the bill for some vacations/retreats, although you'll have to be careful to not do this to the point where others are taking advantage of your generosity.\n4. Sleep.  Perhaps something that a lot of FatFIRE people miss out on, since we're often driving hard for that bottom line.  FatFIRE add-ons: creating a bedroom that is sealed off from outside light, alarm clocks that wake you more slowly and naturally, investing in a high quality mattress, and making sure to structure your day to ensure that sleep is prioritized (for people with newborns, for example, a night nurse can help preserve sleep).\n5. Avoiding the negative health impacts you listed (smoking, drinking, carrying extra weight, drugs, risk-taking endeavors).  Ideally, if you are focused on health, you'd cut out drinking entirely.  There is no healthy level of alcohol.  (But we all must balance health with enjoyment!)\n6. Regular medical visits.  This is less for the doctor's check-up and more for the bloodwork/screenings.  It's good to have regular measurements of blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, teeth X-rays, and other health measurements.\n\n**The stuff that probably isn't worth it:**\n\n1. Fasting.  Fasting is still being researched, and while intermittent fasting does show benefits, I've seen the \"tech bros\" take it to extremes with full-day or multi-day fasts.  These can be dangerous and don't seem to offer any increased health benefits over shorter intervals.  Likely, many of the benefits of longer fasts are due to the reduction in caloric intake, rather than the fast itself.  I'd caution anyone against fasting regularly for longer than 12 hours, and against ever doing more than 24 hours at a time.\n2. Supplementation.  Supplements are the poor man's healthy diet.  Most supplements are unregulated, their claims unproven (and they can claim just about anything as long as they don't state that it *cures a disease*, as the FDA doesn't care), and their contents suspect.  Megadoses range from useless to actively dangerous/deadly.  Someone in FatFIRE can eat a far healthier diet than the average person, and has even less of a need of supplements.\n3. Probiotics.  This is actually my research background, and I can tell you that pretty much every commercial probiotic on the market is shit (no pun intended).  I could write a whole post on their issues.  Again, a healthy diet is a far better move than wasting time looking at probiotics.\n\n**Situationally useful:**\n\n1. Genetic testing.  Get a screening if you're going to be having children or if you would rather be forewarned about some genetic diseases (think Parkinson's Disease).  Keep in mind that most SNPs (single mutations) have a *very small* effect on health outcomes.  If you have a 3x risk of cancer but the average population incidence is only 0.1%, you still only have a 0.3% chance of developing that cancer.\n2. Wearables.  Great if you love data, but you still have to do the actual exercise.  They don't make the actual work any easier.\n3. Blood testing.  Only useful if you are monitoring a specific condition, in my opinion.  Otherwise, get it checked annually at your physical.\n4. Executive physicals/concierge medicine: depends on your wealth and if you want that personal touch.  They won't find diseases earlier, but they can be much better to work with if you are actively monitoring/treating a condition or if you have familial history of some disease.\n\n**Others not mentioned that I care about:**\n\n1. Pollution and microplastics exposure.  We don't know all the details of microplastic ingestion, but it's probably not great.  Limiting the plastic you eat from is one step, but the biggest steps you can take are to avoid synthetic fibers and to stay away from roads (one of the single largest sources of microplastics is tire dust).  \n2. Monitoring activity throughout the day.  Even if you spend an hour in the gym, spending the other 23 sedentary (like at a desk job, even if it's a really fancy desk) is not ideal.  \n3. Skincare!  Even just sunscreen + nightly cleanser + moisturizer is far better than what most men do.  Sunscreen is cheap but incredibly important for fighting both the appearance of aging and skin cancer.\n4. Water.  Don't drink sugary drinks, drink water.  \n\nI think that folks in FatFIRE love the idea of finding that secret trick that costs too much for most to afford, but the truth is that almost all of us would benefit more from improving the basics than trying the extremes.  Even the wealthy can have poor diets, carry excess weight, fail to exercise.\n\n### Comment ID innovdg with +16 score by [(santacruz_steve, Reddit, 2022-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/innovdg/) (in reply to ID innnsl4):\nEPIC answer TY!\n\n### Comment ID inq0ar0 with +16 score by [(dmacerz, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inq0ar0/) (in reply to ID innnsl4):\nFasting has a range of benefits from reducing calorie intake, stabilising blood sugars, giving the liver a break so it can regenerate, improving insulin and pre diabetes issues, resetting hormones.

I would have thought super important considering the way food is manufactured these days these 3 products are the only way to get intake that our bodies have had the last 200,000 years.\n\n#### Comment ID inq5fel with +5 score by [(Islandbeachandrum, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inq5fel/) (in reply to ID inq0ar0):\nAgreed. Regular intermittent fasting is a cornerstone in my life and 3 day fasts a couple times a year have had tremendous health benefits for me. They are not fun and definitely need to be done with caution. I.e. making sure your sodium, potassium and magnesium supplementation is on point - look up \"snake juice\" on Google for a DIY concoction.\n\n#### Comment ID inr7lot with +7 score by [(Romanticon, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inr7lot/) (in reply to ID inq0ar0):\nI agree on the benefits of fasting - but most of these benefits are also seen from intermittent fasting, and it's not been fully separated out how many of them are due to the act of fasting itself, or if they're due to reduction in caloric intake and better mindfulness of diet.  Fasting definitely plays some benefit, but it's likely a part of a larger whole.\n\nLess studied are the longer fasts, like fasting 23 hours per day or people who do extended \"water fasts\".  These can become very dangerous and seem unnecessary, when most benefits could be obtained from just doing regular intraday fasting.\n\nI'm glad to see others are aware of prebiotics!  I'm doubtful on yogurt/kefir, but very enthusiastic about encouraging greater intake of prebiotics.\n\nMy main argument against yogurts is that, while they do contain tons of live microbes, those are microbes evolved and ideally suited to live in cold, lactose-filled, oxygen-rich yogurt.  Your gut is none of those things.  There was a bunch of excitement early on because both yogurt cultures and gut microbiomes contain *Lactobacillus*, but that's a broad genus of bacteria and the individual species differ significantly in gut vs. yogurt.\n\nPrebiotics, for anyone else reading this who isn't familiar, are foods that don't provide direct nutritional benefit to us, but do act as a food source for our gut microbiome.  /u/dmacerz mentioned polyphenols and psyllium husk, but there are plenty of other prebiotics - they're usually labeled on nutrition facts as \"dietary fiber.\" Most are in the form of complex starches that aren't easily broken down by our own digestive enzymes, but can be eaten by our gut microbes.  The big payoff is that, when microbes are feasting on prebiotics, they eat less of the mucus lining of our intestinal tract, reducing chances of inflammation if they eat all the way through to the intestinal wall.\n\nPrebiotics are great, and we should be eating more of them.  This could be a supplement, but - again, as I discussed in my parent comment - a better method is to improve diet.  There are tons of foods with lots of fiber, mainly vegetables, and most modern people simply don't eat enough of them.  You could certainly supplement your diet with prebiotic fiber (pretty much anything with resistant starch and fiber is decent; some people just have potato starch), but you could also focus on naturally upping your fiber and resistant starch intake in the foods you eat.\n\n### Comment ID inppcpb with +11 score by [(CupResponsible797, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inppcpb/) (in reply to ID innnsl4):\nSome supplements like creatine are indisputably “worth it”.\n\n### Comment ID inxp2pu with +2 score by [(blablooblan, Reddit, 2022-09-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inxp2pu/) (in reply to ID innnsl4):\nAny skin care brand recs for men?\n\n#### Comment ID inxvodl with +3 score by [(Romanticon, Reddit, 2022-09-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inxvodl/) (in reply to ID inxp2pu):\nI personally like NIVEA's moisturizer that also has SPF 15, because I'm lazy and don't want to bother with multiple creams if I can help it...\n\n...but I'm no shill, and I think more importantly, it depends on your skin type.

As you know, the most impactful things we can do are related to good diet, exercise, sleep, and stress-control habits.. Once those things are in place, the more speculative interventions will likely have very small to zero incremental impact. All those supplements that look good in various studies don't add much if you have already optimized your diet with real food (especially fruit and veg). Definitely get an annual checkup, but running every test out there will have very modest additional benefit while significantly increasing the risk of overtreatment.\n\nAdvanced exercise interventions like low oxygen training (or high oxygen training or EWOT machines)? Remote ischemic conditioning? Yeah, I've tried them but honestly couldn't really tell you whether they are doing anything besides a placebo effect. I've even looked into hyperbaric oxygen treatments; again jury is still very much out. Perhaps in the future there will be magic bullets, but currently most of this is more hype than proven interventions.\n\nFinal point is that I think most people look for magic bullets, while avoiding the harder and vastly more evidence based lifestyle modifications.

Basically any chemical type names, non-actual food things. Try finding a solid farmer who raises free-range, high quality of life animals. Not only is it delicious, but you can feel and taste the difference. This obviously excludes restaurants, but a considerable amount actually knew and took pride in where they sourced their meat.  Worth asking and filtering that way.\n\nMaintain proper excretion/digestion. Walking does this—the impact of gravity gets it moving—proper portions and not filling your stomach often does as well. \n\nWhen doing a physical-spiritual practice, have in mind the psychobody. Practicing yoga or Qi Gong (or prayer in some traditions) can allow you access to your body in a way that you gain greater awareness of parts previously unknown. Not only does this translate to moving differently after discovering new muscles/movements you were unaware of, it leads to new neural connections so that you can process reality differently. Emotions are physically stored through different chemical markers in cells, and there’s been personality links to certain diseases and physical pathologies of the body. Cultivating a connection, compassion, and acceptance for things you might have had to store away long ago can maximize outcomes for health as well as a greater depth of life and knowledge of oneself as they got to this point. Increases QOL bc of increased relational ability with oneself and others. \n\nMartial arts study has an echo effect on life as well—not necessary but has changed lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID inlt2vx with +1 score by [(Asguardian26, Reddit, 2022-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inlt2vx/) (in reply to ID x922ci):\nRemindme! 1 day\n\n## Comment ID inneprz with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inneprz/) (in reply to ID x922ci):\nNAD+ & PC IV therapy on a regular basis, also Ten Pass Ozone in the spring and fall. \n\nFind a good functional medicine doctor and get on a personalized supplement regimen. \n\nFive Element Acupuncture (and herbal medicine). \n\nAll of this was life changing stuff for me.\n\n## Comment ID inpodn8 with +1 score by [(swerve408, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inpodn8/) (in reply to ID x922ci):\nWon’t genetic testing possibly impact your health insurance quotes/rates?\n\nAlso I feel like some of the things you listed such as fasting, probiotics, supplements, cold/heat exposure etc are absolutely meaningless if your sleep quality and length is poor \n\nIt’s like trying to chase the best savings account yield percentage while not focusing on growing your income\n\n## Comment ID inps7iu with +1 score by [(anotherfireburner, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inps7iu/) (in reply to ID x922ci):\nBiggest thing I regret not doing in my 20s and 30s is regular dental checkups.

Not a tracker.\n\nNothing can do what o2 ring does. It gives precise measurements of oxygen throughout sleep in a convenient way. I haven't found anything close to it.\n\nFitbit/Garmin/apple watch can probably do what Halo does. I hated Fitbits app tbh. It's not about the raw measurements but how the insights are shown in the app and Fitbit's app was a mess when I tried it few years ago. I think Halo's app does a remarkable job with: activity minutes and scores, sleep graphs and measurements, resting heart rate, continuous heart rate (for workout). \n\nI'm also trying a CGM for glucose. It's been pretty helpful too.\n\n### Comment ID kbdovec with +1 score by [(consciousnesscloud, Reddit, 2023-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/ydi2h0/best_purchases_youve_made_to_improve_your_quality/kbdovec/) (in reply to ID itw7ffz):\nhi how do you use the navratna oil, not much info online?\n\n## Comment ID itsgffl with +50 score by [(MagicalGinny, Reddit, 2022-10-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/ydi2h0/best_purchases_youve_made_to_improve_your_quality/itsgffl/) (in reply to ID ydi2h0):\nInstant Pot 11-in-1\n\nBasic gym equipment\n\nNeti Pot\n\nAudiobooks (educational)\n\nGarmin watch\n\nHeart Rate Monitor\n\nBasic pre-workout supplements (no filler)\n\nSunrise alarm clock\n\nVisits with an apt psychotherapist\n\nAnd of course... a dog 🐕\n\n### Comment ID ittciqz with +8 score by [(beanie_0, Reddit, 2022-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/ydi2h0/best_purchases_youve_made_to_improve_your_quality/ittciqz/) (in reply to ID itsgffl):\nNeti pot is a life saver when I’ve been to the city or get bunged up 🙌🏻\n\n### Comment ID itsw0at with +7 score by [(pebblebypebble, Reddit, 2022-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/ydi2h0/best_purchases_youve_made_to_improve_your_quality/itsw0at/) (in reply to ID itsgffl):\nI second the dog and the garmin!\n\n### Comment ID itsufzs with +2 score by [(suitsnwatches, Reddit, 2022-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/ydi2h0/best_purchases_youve_made_to_improve_your_quality/itsufzs/) (in reply to ID itsgffl):\nCurious to know what heart rate monitor you use/what’s your pre workout\n\n#### Comment ID itze665 with +2 score by [(MagicalGinny, Reddit, 2022-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/ydi2h0/best_purchases_youve_made_to_improve_your_quality/itze665/) (in reply to ID itsufzs):\nI used to use the Garmin HRM, but they tend to konk out after about a year of daily use.

The Oura USP is their sleep score algorithms which give a score out of 100 for every sleep session. Initially they were a great startup with their Gen2 ring, truly admirable in their business model and product offering. Then they shifted to sponsoring athletes and now the customer pays for those sponsorship deals in monthly billing. \n\nIt’s powerful to quantify sleep but as you say your Apple Watch has robust sleep tracking and does a WHOLE lot more than oura ever will.\n\nOura will be run off the road in next few years as Apple tunes their algorithms. Oura’s speciality is now monthly billing for features they used to include for free. Pricey gimmick which I can’t recommend. \n\nOnce Google bring out the Pixel watch 2 with decent all-day battery that will allow daily sleep (hassle free) tracking and tune their sleep algorithms - there simply won’t be space for Oura to offer anything unique. This may sound like Oura-hate speech but I was a long time follower of the company and sung their praises to anyone I could.\n\n#### Comment ID iv5e1xy with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-11-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/ydi2h0/best_purchases_youve_made_to_improve_your_quality/iv5e1xy/) (in reply to ID ittcfgy):\nI also have the Apple Watch and use it for sleep, but it can’t track day sleeping accurately unfortunately.

It will not do ANYTHING for you unless you do something with the data it provides, but as a personal trainer who has been programming for clients for years - I can harness the power of that data very well.\n\n* I've used mine to get down from a more-or-less stable bodyfat percentage of around 15% to a more-or-less stable bodyfat percentage of around 12%. (measured by bioelectrical impedance machine every month)\n* I've used its data to help motivate me to change my sleeping habits, including going to sleep 2 hours earlier and waking up 2.5 hours earlier (so sleeping a little less, but higher quality sleep and feeling more refreshed).\n* A big, big one is that it helped me understand that I was just overall way too active, especially because I walked a lot. I eventually realized that if my fitbit says I burned around 24,000 cals/week I feel on the edge of okay, if it says I burned 25,000 cals in a week, I feel like dried up dog shit. Now I'm more still during my rest days, and even more still on days that I have a big workout planned, and I feel literally like I'm ten years younger. Staying under 23,000 cals/week is now a big part of my life-routine.\n* It also helped motivate me to resume my meditation habit. I realized that on weeks where I meditated my resting heart-rate was much lower, and my HRV was much higher. Even though I ALSO felt a dozen other benefits from meditating, I didn't have anything quantitative to motivate me. So now I meditate every day again, partly because I can SEE the effects every morning when I wake up and check my fitbit.\n\n## Comment ID ituz3dn with +17 score by [(jane4now, Reddit, 2022-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/ydi2h0/best_purchases_youve_made_to_improve_your_quality/ituz3dn/) (in reply to ID ydi2h0):\nContinuous Glucose Monitor.

While I doubt PA is right on every little detail and min/max solution he advocates, he is right on many of them. Having cardio fitness as you age will make you live longer, live healthier, and improve how you feel every day of your life. The same applies for strength training. \n\nOne note: you seem to imply Zone 2 is vigorous. I would not say that. I would classify zone 2 as “peppy”, and easy to recover from.

The border between Z1 and Z2 representing the first lactate turnpoint \\~ 2mmol. The border between Z2 and Z3 representing the second turnpoint \\~ 4mmol.In this model, Zone 2 would be similar to a Zone 3 (on a Five Zone scale) - correlating with somewhere around 80-85% of Max HR.\n\nIn any case, I don't know if I have misinterpreted the question, but it seems many replies have read the question differently than I.\n\nThe subject is asking if \"cardio is necessary\", but the main body implies if high intensity cardio is necessary, or if his long walks are adequate.\n\nI'm still new to this subject as a whole but I've immersed myself in it over the past six months, digesting hours of content from Peter Attia, Mike Joyner, Andy Gaupin, Huberman, Stephen Seiler, etc. Stephen in particular has a lot of specialised content on youtube focusing on this, and \"how low is too low\" intensity wise.\n\nI'd direct you to this chart ([https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/coggan-s-physiological-adaptation-chart/75468](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/coggan-s-physiological-adaptation-chart/75468)) which shows the different adaptations (or lack thereof) that happen during cardio at different intensity.\n\nReally, if your goal is to improve VO2 max -- long walks are not adequate. That doesn't mean you wont enjoy those walks and still burn calories - but it won't do wonders for VO2max. That chart will loosely illustrate the amount of Vo2 max improvements you'll get from each intensity level - as well as a plethora of other adaptations that occur. It's quite informative. (I focus on Vo2 max purely as that's typically touted as one of the best predictors of longevity as a whole, but there are tons of other benefits from high intensity cardio).\n\nA simple cardio workout routine (which has worked for me, improving my 5K time from over 30 minutes to less than 19 minutes across a four month time span) has been:\n\n3 x \"Zone 2\" runs (based on the 5-HR Zones) for 45-75 minutes per run (dependent on how much time I have - more the better)  \nand  \n1 x \"Vo2 max protocol\" - my preference is 1km repeats (running at 95% effort for 1km) with a 1:1 rest recovery ratio. Repeat this 5-6 times, with 1.5km warm up.  \n\n\nIf I get time for another run, I'll typically throw in a Tempo or Threshold Run (eg. running for 5-10K at 90% of max HR).\n\nThat improved my Vo2 max from 35 (estimate) to 55 (estimate) across those same four months. (Estimate based on the average of both Apple Watch and the vo2 max estimate that the Cooper Test (12 minute run) formula spits out).\n\n## Comment ID k92m2md with +10 score by [(eat_natural, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k92m2md/) (in reply to ID 17ub1wx):\nIt’s my understanding that cardiorespiratory fitness has distinct health benefits over weight resistance training. While there are overlapping benefits between the two, cardiorespiratory exercises have a stronger beneficial impact on vascular health by improving the amount of nitric oxide present, blood vessel responsiveness to nitric oxide, and thus, a lower resting blood pressure. Beyond that, there is evidence to suggest that endothelial integrity is improved with a lower likelihood of lipoprotein penetration into the endothelium. Separately, there is also evidence that running stabilizes pre-existing atherosclerotic plaque and also reduces plaque volume / size. Angiogenesis is another benefit, where additional blood vessel growth occurs, while also dilating and enlarging existing blood vessels. There is evidence that endurance training reduces risk of sudden cardiac death from arrhythmia. Endurance training has a more significant impact on cardiac function, such as stroke volume, as well as VO2 max. It is my understanding that VO2 max is the strongest predictor of longevity, more so than insulin resistance, hypertension, obesity, etc.  Both weight resistance training and endurance training improve glucose and lipid metabolism. \n\n[Exercise benefits in cardiovascular diseases: from mechanisms to clinical implementation. Pedro L. Valenzuela.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37005351/)\n\nTo answer your question specifically, if you’re lifting hard enough at a high degree of effort and intensity, you will probably derive some of the above benefits. I do believe you would obtain additional benefit by incorporating some endurance training. Hopping on the stairclimber at the gym may be a practical way to build lower strength while incorporating endurance training.\n\n### Comment ID k95ka8m with +1 score by [(toothmanhelpting, Reddit, 2023-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k95ka8m/) (in reply to ID k92m2md):\nTo sum it up….

There is a 50% improvement in mortality between the worst quartile and the second worst quartile. Worst to above average is 60-70% reduction in 10 year mortality. There is no drug that compares, not by a long shot. The only way to get improved cardiorespiratory fitness is with aerobic exercise. And it doesn't take much to go from worst to second worst. It does take a lot of volume exercising to make it to the top 5 percentile but there continues to be a mortality benefit. \n\nResistance training is beneficial too.\n\n## Comment ID k93hb78 with +7 score by [(andonemoreagain, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k93hb78/) (in reply to ID 17ub1wx):\nRhonda Patrick had a recent podcast with a scientist in the field about the specific benefits of hard cardio.

Overall this is worth thinking on, though Milo is talking about 6 days/week of lifting plus a lot of steps, not OPs 3 days.\n\nMy critiques of the Wolf approach are (i) a sufficiently powered subgroup analysis is probably needed to even consider a concentrated approach like that (ii) Wolf doesn't seem to appreciate a basic point about risk management-- i.e. a more diversified approach tends to pay off quite well for long term investments in a very uncertain environment (iii) Attia emphasizes performance metrics  like VO2 max which Wolf criticizes as having a major genetic component  so he wants to look at hours of effort instead... but completely ignoring performance is a bit ironic as Wolf is a strength coach so surely he appreciates the fact that *well designed and executed* lifting programs are not remotely comparable in results to that of the typical gym goer even when hours are equated... and the idea that training quality doesn't impact healthspan strikes me a as quite leap.\n\n### Comment ID k941wwe with +5 score by [(AndeyR, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k941wwe/) (in reply to ID k93hcyy):\nI feel like Peter gamifies VO2max too much, its a proxy, and chances are, training specifically for this number would not do much (or would not be as effective as someone doing sports and getting to this number as a byproduct)\n\nNext step would be to train grip strength )\n\n#### Comment ID k946hc4 with +2 score by [(NotSaucerman, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k946hc4/) (in reply to ID k941wwe):\nYea, I anticipate Peter to deprecate VO2 max over time in favor of a basket of cardio  indicators once more data becomes available.

Doing things that improve your heart health is probably a good way to improve health span.\n\nI think the reason people don't like cardio is because they buy into the \"no pain, no gain\" mentality.\n\nFor example, embracing long duration zone 2 isn't really that \"intensive\". I think it can actually be boring...so I tend to do it on an indoor bike while playing video games.\n\nI don't do the high intensity intervals as described by Attia. Instead, I've been doing clean and jerks with double kettlebells 3 days a week (modified version of Geoff Neupert's Long Cycle of Death program). About 100 reps spread over 30 minutes in various rep schemes. Lots of time in Zone 5, but with work periods on the order of 15-30 seconds (depending on rep scheme) and similar rest periods. But each workout has 30-40 sets depending on the rep scheme.\n\nSo not the prescription Peter gives, but my guess is that it's fine provided I'm not trying to be an elite cyclist. And it's way easier on my knees than sprinting. Seems to me like a great combination of strength and cardio. It's the only workout where I really get that \"runner's high\".

No one knows when your first lactate turnpoint occurs (it's individual). This is technically when you cross over from Zone 2 to Zone 3. This is typically correlated with 65-80% of max HR - but everyone's will actually be different. But if you reach that range with brisk walking, then yes - Zone 2 can be achieved.\n\nHowever as you get fitter, you will notice you can now maintain the same pace as before, but at a much lower heart rate - meaning you will have to increase the intensity to stay in that zone. Whether this is simply ramping up the incline %, or if you need to up the pace to a slow jog.\n\nMost people will sustain Zone 2 with a slow jog - you definitely do not have to \"run\" to stay in Zone 2 (subjective - if you're fit enough to run fast relative to others in Zone 2, you probably still don't perceive that run as a fast run, since you'd be capable of running even faster I guess!).\n\nFor me, when I first started cardio six months ago. Here's some stats for comparison:\n\nApril 19th, 2023. \"Zone 2 run\" (My Max HR is 199. Zone 2 for me is estimated at 128-160)4KM was at Zone 2 (about 30 mins) and the last 1KM was at a faster pace.\n\n1KM, 6:34, 154 HR1KM, 7:07, 160 HR1KM, 7:30, 154 HR1KM, 6:35, 154 HR1KM, 5:39, 167 HR\n\nSo that average pace of around 6:30 minutes per KM, kept me in Zone 2.\n\nHowever fast forward six months, I now need to run at around 5:00-5:15 per KM to stay in the same HR zone. Back when I started, 1 KM at 5:00 was the same time as my max 1km effort! Now I can sustain this for 15+km IN \"zone 2\" heart rate range...\n\nTL;DR - You could sustain a Zone 2 workout with brisk walks, but as your fitness improves, walking pace may no longer be sufficient.\n\nStephen Seiler has an interesting youtube video on low intensity, and \"How low is too low\" eg. Zone 1 vs Zone 2. Would recommend a lot of his content too!\n\n## Comment ID l92ehfi with +1 score by [(gettotea, Reddit, 2024-06-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/l92ehfi/) (in reply to ID 17ub1wx):\nBookmark\n\n## Comment ID lvvsfev with +1 score by [(ThatFaithlessness545, Reddit, 2024-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/lvvsfev/) (in reply to ID 17ub1wx):\n100% without a doubt, look at the most healthy fittest aged population amd what they do.\n they are soo fit and healthy still at their age because they do regular cardio not just weights.\n\n\nYou look at people who only lifted weights for most of their lives and they are either very imobile from not moving their body, they have heart issues and are overweight because all the muscle has gone and they put on alot of fat or they're dead if they were taking drugs or just eating too much all the time trying to bulk up, \n\n\nThat puts alot of pressure on your heart amd other organs while cardio gets your blood circulating, joints lubricated, keeps your brain sharp, flushes your system, improves digestion, burns alot of calories, etc. All of which weight lifting only does a fraction of if any\n\n\nDo both in balance,\n\n\nMuscle growth is cool and all but not at the expense of your overall health and well-being especially into later years\n\n## Comment ID k92v3mv with +1 score by [(medhat20005, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k92v3mv/) (in reply to ID 17ub1wx):\nIf the goal is to \"optimize health and longevity,\" I would guess (really, it's all somewhat educated guessing anyways) that more, but not too much more, than long slow walks would derive most of the benefits of a more structured zone 2 workout several times a week.

It's all relative, training above your level isn't sustainable, but as you adapt to training, your limit will shift, and what is a reasonable volume depends on that.\n\nGiven all this, there is no clear answer, because it depends on so many things. What can your body handle naturally? What's your running fitness like? What kind of injury / overtraining risk are you willing to accept? How hard are your workouts?\n\nThere is not anything fundamentally unhealthy about running marathons; problems arise when people *race* them, pushing their limits - as with any sport, doing that comes at a risk, and while the risks of running long distance may be different than those seen in other sports, the reason people get hurt has little to do with the distance per se. If you are trained for it and go at a pace that is well within your comfort zone, then even ultramarathon distances aren't really all that hardcore. I've done 10k races that were definitely harder on my body than some 30-40 mile runs I've done at a comfortable (as far as such a thing as \"comfort\" exists past mile 20) pace. Humans have run much longer distances than that throughout history; even the legenday Pheidippides, who inspired the Marathon as a discipline, didn't just run from Marathon to Athens (~25 miles) - he ran from Marathon to Sparta (some 120 miles) in one day, then back the next day, then participated in the battle, and THEN he'd run to Athens, where he collapsed from exhaustion (but probably survived - the dying part may be just poetic hyperbole). So not \"25 miles and then death\", but \"almost 300 miles and a battle, and he still made it\". And he was just doing his job; Greek armies employed professional runners who would routinely run upwards of 100 miles in a day as part of their jobs.\n\nSoooo... what do?\n\nBasically, if you want to run for health, and have your strength covered with lifting, then I'd recommend starting with some beginner program (couch to 5k, a.k.a. c25k, is good), and from there, gently work your way up to where you can comfortably run for an hour or so, at a leisurely pace, a couple times per week (putting you in the 3-5 hours per week range). It seems that this is approximately where the cost / benefit ration of maintaining the required training volume starts shelving off - you still get upwards of 90% of the health benefits, and if trained properly, a very very small risk of serious damage or injury. \"Every other day\" seems like a decent balance to me - for a beginner, more days may be too taxing, and later it may not be worth pushing for more, especially if you also do other exercise.\n\n\"Conserving energy\" is not a concern btw; lifting doesn't burn that much, and taps into different energy sources (slow running is mainly fat and some glycogen, but you need to keep going for about 3 hours or so to make a serious dent in your glyco stores), while lifting mainly runs on ATP, and gets refilled from available carbs (but you can never possibly lift enough to deplete the glyco stores). So if you \"run out of energy\", what really happens is that your muscles aren't recovered yet. But if you run at a truly slow pace, and lift heavy (hi-res, lo-rep), then you will almost exclusively recruit slow-twitch fibres for running, and fast-twitch for lifting. OTOH, if you run too fast, running will use fast-twitch too, and the result is slow progress on the running front, and jelly legs when lifting after running.\n\n### Comment ID em34zlw with +6 score by [(OracleOfOntario, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em34zlw/) (in reply to ID em31y9d):\nwow, great post, that's some sage advice.\n\n## Comment ID em2okkw with +12 score by [(ithinkitsbeertime, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em2okkw/) (in reply to ID birz8u):\nThe CDC says:\n\n>For substantial health benefts, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) to 300 minutes (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes) to 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity.  \n>  \n>Preferably, aerobic activity should be spread throughout the week. Additional health benefts are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond the equivalent of 300 minutes (5 hours) of moderate-intensity physical activity a week.\n\nThey define 'moderate' and 'vigorous' in terms of METs but jogging / running probably meets the thresholds for vigorous unless you're walking big parts of it. So 3-4 days of 30-45 minutes would certainly get you there. Lifting of course also counts.

Main motivation to help with anxiety and depression. Each time I do 3 sittings usually in 85 C for 20, 18, 15 min. Between each sitting I naturally cool for about 10-15 min.

My heart usually start beating harder around 10 min mark, beating really hard at the 15 min mark.

Forget the numbers, degrees and minutes, smart watches, **optimization**. Do whatever you like, and feel like doing. Don't stay in the sauna past discomfort just because someone online said they do X minutes at Y temperature, you have no business trying to reach that. Stay in the sauna as long as you're comfortable, cool down however you like and do multiple sessions in the sauna if you're up for that, and finish with a good shower.  \n\nIf you just relax and don't stress the details, going to sauna may help with those positive mental health outcomes.  \n\nAs for other health benefits, they are mainly things seen over decades of use.

Sauna can help recovery from mental challenges if there are other means involved, such as therapy, exercise, diet and possibly medication.

In other words, the fitbit incentivized walking/running, and that's it. I felt like I was wasting a workout if I did anything else, so all I did was run or go for super long walks. \n\nOn the other hand, without a tracker (as I have been the last few months), I fell into another bad pattern: all my workouts were easy. As a solo person working out, I was too lazy to push my heart rate. I would either lift heavy weight or go on easy breezy jogs. I did get strong, but but developed zero endurance. \n\nThis is where the whoop comes in: Every morning the whoop will tell me if I'm ready for a huge cardiovascular strain. As others have said, powerlifting, walks, etc will barely register, if at all, as straining. This pushed me to try different hard workouts to push my heart. Through some experimenting, I have found the best way to push my heart rate as much as possible. When I do this, invariably when I wake up the next day my body is not ready for high strain. These are the days I lift weights or go on easy walks. So for me, the whoops forces me to better balance my workouts. It doesn't penalize you for not pushing hard on high strain days, but you do feel a sense of leaving something on the table. Nor does it penalize you for switching up workouts, it doesn't care as long as your hr is up. I switch between running, rowing, jump rope, heavy bag boxing, kettlebell swing and box jumps. \n\nSo for me personally, if my sole goal is to get my hr up and keep it up as long as possible, I know I can do a workout that incorporates rounds of double unders for 10-20 minutes, and then jump on the rower for another 40 and I'm spent. I can'd do this every day or else my feet hurt, so I switch to something like kettlebell swings. In this way I'm more balanced, don't burn out as easily. \n\nTl;dr: whoop does motivate by pushing me to train hard some days but not all days, gives me motivation to balance.\n\n## Comment ID ewo2rkk with +1 score by [(tessa0k, Reddit, 2019-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/cp9ndv/whoop_suitable_for_people_that_dont_overtrain_but/ewo2rkk/) (in reply to ID cp9ndv):\nThank you for your response.

I’m would get my 10k steps a day mostly by hiking, ate a good diet, whatever. I didn’t lift weights and I didn’t do cardio but I thought walks were sufficient. However, my heart rate variability was always around ~10. Apparently this is pretty bad, haha. I always assumed my Fitbit was malfunctional.\n\nWell, during my first semester of college my dorm was located across the street from the free university gym. There was literally no reason not to go, so I started doing cardio and some lifting. Literally a few weeks later my HRV goes from consistently ~10 to >30. I guess steps really aren’t sufficient if you really want to optimize health.\n\n## Comment ID kd2h4k9 with +55 score by [(groggygirl, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitbit/comments/18groyw/thought_my_fitbits_were_inaccurate_turns_out_i/kd2h4k9/) (in reply to ID 18groyw):\nI do an hour or two of cardio a day.

You’re always gonna have something come up, but it seems that exercise reduces that\n\n#### Comment ID jlvoxom with +16 score by [(Dratini_ghost, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlvoxom/) (in reply to ID jlugo8n):\nYes. Joint pain or back pain comes from one of two things for me. When I stop working on flexibility, or putting on extra weight. It's not really age that causes those pains in your 30's/40's. Or rather, the pains are not inevitable. It's a matter of \"use it or lose it\" and not balancing out sedentary life with active muscle building and flexibility.\n\nFoam rolling and stretching goes a long way along with exercise to \"reset\" my body and prevent the aches and pains. Yoga has been one of the best things for all of my little pains in the ass (and legs, and shoulders, and neck), by far.\n\n### Comment ID jlu7a3d with +115 score by [(tuxette, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlu7a3d/) (in reply to ID jltr69o):\n>  never stop working out\n\nThis. \n\nNever stop.

I'm terrified of getting old and being/feeling helpless because I didn't focus on functional fitness when I was relatively young. I'm going to lift as long as I possibly can.

As women age hormonal changes make us lose muscle easily and it’s harder to put back on. Over time this has an effect on our hormonal balance, our bone density and it also is a main cause of the slowing of our metabolism. A lot of women get overly focused on cardio for weight loss, but running really messes you up over time, it wears out all of your joints. Cardiovascular health *is* important but maintaining muscle mass is imperative. If you want cardio, focus on something low impact that also builds strength (swimming is the best in my opinion. Bike riding and hiking are good too.) get out in nature, it positively effects your blood pressure and stress levels, which in turn will keep your weight down and your heart healthy (stress has a lot of systemic consequences including weight gain). \n\nNutrition: throw out diet culture. Eat balanced, regular meals. Balanced means a protein a fat a carb and a fruit/vegetable. That is a meal. Try to eat at least three of those a day, more if you are still hungry. Emphasize protein to keep your muscle up. If you want dessert, eat it. Let go of food rules and focus on nourishment instead of deprivation. \n\nBest long term exercise for supporting these goals in my opinion: swimming, bike riding, yoga (unless you are hyper-mobile) pilates, weight lifting, dance (GREAT for your long term cognitive health), aerial acrobatics (I do pole dancing, HELLO upper body and core strength!), WALKING IS SO UNDERRATED, hiking, cross country skiing, snow shoeing I’m sure I can come up with more but really, find something relatively low impact that you genuinely enjoy doing, that’s the key. Consistency will win out against perfection every day of the week. It’s about building small habits and stacking them up over time.\n\n## Comment ID jlts7mb with +52 score by [(OnehappyOwl44, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlts7mb/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI have never restricted my diet in anyway. I eat whatever I want but try to stay mindful of portions. I avoid snacking in the evening unless it's a Movie night or something. My only exercise is walking 3-5 times a week in Spring, Summer and Fall (my route is about 3km). In Winter I'm basically a slug who reads and watches TV series. Sometimes I go Skating but not often enough to count. My weight has remained steady within 10lbs my whole life. I had two kids and a Hysterectomy in my 30's. I'm now 45 and entering Menopause.

There are no tricks to it. When I have the opportunity, I make sure to get movement in whether it’s walking or lifting weights. I don’t restrict my eating (but also am mindful of calories taken in…I just am not counting calories) and try to focus on getting healthy fats, protein, and carbs each day. I also value cooking and flavor and really just appreciate food. I’m currently pregnant for the first time and my body has definitely changed a lot through the process so far (which has been tough to be honest) but I still follow the same principles (as much as I can - which is definitely less than before pregnancy) but I plan to adhere to the same approach post-partum.  \n\nBiggest thing I can say is that WE are in charge of our health and can absolutely maintain and even optimize health and fitness in our 30s and beyond. But it requires intention and investment and the belief that, hey, my body is capable of fitness regardless of age and that is reason enough to continue to invest in it.\n\n## Comment ID jltvyot with +44 score by [(FixPuzzleheaded577, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltvyot/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nDon’t have a baby and ppd.\n\n### Comment ID jlu0uzx with +20 score by [(Cat_With_The_Fur, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlu0uzx/) (in reply to ID jltvyot):\nFor real.

Love. It. And I definitely go through phases where I will eat more of it and of lesser quality than I should allow. \n\nBut I get back on track to healthy eating after a couple of weeks because that is what my body is used to, and I feel better doing it. My food habits include eating boiled eggs, roast chicken, baked fish, good quality canned tuna, lots of salad, sautéed spinach and other veg, low glycemic index fruit like blueberries, and some almonds. Whole wheat pasta, some lentils, too. I wash and cut up veg like broccoli and store it in a paper towel lined Pyrex dish in the fridge so it's grab and go. I'll bake a batch of chicken breast or thighs (skin off) and freeze on wax paper so it's easy to heat up when I need it. \n\nI walk a lot. I try to do 3.5 miles 3 to 5 times a week. I need to be lifting weights, and yoga makes me feel great when I do it. I like Bree and Flo short yoga classes (15-30 minutes) on YouTube. \n\nIMO, if habits are broken in then you're on autopilot and your body will gravitate to what it \"thinks\" it should be doing. This is for good and bad habits, so I reinforce the good habits.\n\n## Comment ID jltoufe with +25 score by [(Explodingovary, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltoufe/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI just do portion control and trying to make healthier choices 70-80% of the time.

You don't need to go fully vegan/plant-based to have a solid diet and healthy weight, but it was something that became easy for me pretty quickly, and then it stuck for a variety of reasons. You can do a vegan diet and be unhealthy, true, but in general, it supports good health. Whatever works for you, get your diet sorted out to something you can sustain. \"Eat food, mostly plants, not too much\" is good advice and a good target. \n\nThen just keep moving. I rotate through hobbies and could never stick with a gym membership, but I just keep finding something to do. For some seasons of my life, that was climbing and yoga. In others, skiing and mountain biking. Another, road biking and weight lifting. Currently, hiking and paddle boarding/kayaking. Even just a solid hour-long evening walk or living room YT yoga session will serve you well. Strength training is important as you age too, but if it's between long evening walks and nothing, then go get that cardio in.\n\nSeparate from going vegan, I had to quit drinking when I realized it was a migraine trigger. I don't think being 100% sober forever is the only way to be healthy, but if you're in the habit of drinking regularly, it's probably a good idea to set it down and fix the 'habit' part. Alcohol really is poison (delicious poison, but poison nonetheless), and there are plenty of ways to supplant whatever health benefits they're trying to sell for it (antioxidants, etc). \n\nWhat motivates me is watching older people who pay little to no attention to their health act like health and mobility are completely out of our control and then endlessly complain as their health declines (kind of like the people who say things like \"you can't plan or really ever be 'ready' for kids lololol\" as if birth control and financial planning are things that do not exist). I also live in a place where you do see a lot of older people out hiking and biking - it's definitely possible to enjoy an active life in your later years, but it doesn't happen by accident. Not even *trying* to stay active and healthy is a sure ticket to pain and lower quality of life, so just keep getting back on the horse, no matter where you fell off. \n\nYou don't really get to choose your health problems, but you can choose how well you take care of yourself in spite of whatever challenges you face. Lots of people would hear \"vegan and no alcohol\" and assume it's no fun and a constant bummer, but it's really nice feeling healthy and not being hungover like, ever. And I'm a good cook, so being vegan doesn't rob me anything on that side of things. My quality of life is higher because of it, not lower.\n\n### Comment ID jlu5t5o with +3 score by [(plutonianbitch, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlu5t5o/) (in reply to ID jlts6qh):\nYes to all of this 💗\n\n## Comment ID jltqns2 with +117 score by [(freshie4o9, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltqns2/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nGenetics.

Doing a squat or deadlift hits your body so much harder than something like leg extensions on a machine 2) just a high daily activity level is important.

Find what makes you feel happy and works do you. You cannot do it all at once, perfectly 100% of the the time. Be gentle with yourself. Don’t compare yourself to others. Don’t deprive yourself of foods you love, but think of adding in more healthy foods. I love fried chicken, but if I’m going to have it, I’ll have a salad or vegetable on the side. Try to move every day, but not every workout needs to be intense. Walking on off days can be a very good friend, and it gets you outside where you can calm your mind and focus on your surroundings. Sleep. Cutting back on alcohol has also worked really well for me. It’s all about incremental progress and sustainable habits. I’m feeling more motivated and stronger now at 36 than I did at 26. Looking forward to what my 40s can bring.\n\nEdit: Adding that it is hard to outwork a bad diet/high caloric intake with exercise. I took my overweight dog to the vet a few years ago, and he said, “It all starts at the food bowl.” I think about this all the time for myself.\n\n## Comment ID jluli0u with +5 score by [(wholeselfin, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jluli0u/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nFor me, 2 things helped:\n1.  Running.  I was lucky that this has been my exercise of choice, because it’s so much easier to motivate for and fit into a busy schedule and holes in the day than things that require going to a gym, wearing special clothes and equipment, meeting up with a partner or team.  You can really just put on your shoes and go. In a pinch, I’ve run in jeans and dresses. It’s available 24/7, from 30-95 degrees with proper adaptations (some people run much colder than this but I’m a cold weather wimp).  I keep a gym bag in my car and run during my kids’ activities.  I also have a big dog and run confidently with her after dark. \n2.  Having kids and keeping up with them.  When you go to the playground, don’t just sit and watch and catch up on your phone.  I am 50, my youngest is 9, and we do cartwheels, monkey bars, play basketball, I try to skateboard but that’s one thing I can’t keep up with.

For me it's triathlons. For someone else, it's barre class or yoga. Whatever keeps your body moving will 100% benefit you in the long run.\n\n\nStart incorporating weight lifting into your routine. You will NOT get bulky. You will build skeletol muscle that will help your body maintain its mobility and bone density as you age.\n\n\nSomeone else mentioned mobility. Keep up your stretching. Take care of your injuries. Do your physical therapy. Not only will these help you heal up faster if you do get injured, but they will help prevent further injury in the first place.\n\n\nAs for nutrition: 80/20. I eat healthy 80% of the time. The other 20% for me means pizza and a beer every single Friday, and 2 Dove chocolates after lunch and dinner. Do I have some unfortunate body fat? Yes. Is it biologically necessary for me as a woman to have body fat in the areas it's in? Also, yes.\n\n\nJust remember to keep thinking big picture.

It’s just that around 30, you begin to visibly see the ramifications of your lifestyle. Depending on your lifestyle—the rate of the body aging, weight gain, cognitive decline, all of it is significantly impacted. This should hopefully be empowering because it means we have more control over our personal health and fitness with age than is let on in the states.\n\nI first focused on my blood sugar regulation, as blood sugar spikes can cause gradual metabolic damage, inflammation and thus aging, and slowing the metabolism over time. This results in that stubborn fat that won’t move. Living a sedentary life (like sitting at a desk all day then sitting on the couch all night) also slows our metabolism, and this lowers our energy and efficiency with burning fat.\n\nHere in the states we’re led to believe caring about the blood sugar is only for people worried about diabetes.\n\nAll of this to say—regular walks, leading my meals with protein & fiber before my sweet treats (to prevent blood sugar spikes without restricting), eating fresh raw fruits& veggies when possible, and 3x/week cardio made a HUGE difference in my life.\n\n## Comment ID jltlhl2 with +13 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltlhl2/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nUhh...

Even when I travel I try to pack snacks instead of eating at the airport or on the road. 95% of the food I cook doesn’t come out of a box. I’m not cooking full, organic, fresh meals that have been kissed by the sun god or anything. Just pasta with carrots or fajitas or whatever. \nWhen I want a cookie, I eat a cookie. But I actively buy foods without added sugar. I also don’t eat if I’m not hungry and don’t feel bad if I overeat due to hormones. Which means the days before my period I’ll eat anything not still breathing. The days after, I could live off a yogurt and a handful of cashews. Also, I drink water with lemon and black coffee and never soda or sugary drinks. (And booze because of course)\n\nAs for working out, I work out so I can do the things I enjoy when I can actually do them. I love to hike and backpack, so I need to stay in shape year round so that when the time comes, I’m not struggling. I actually enjoy manual labor like working in the yard and shoveling snow so I lean into those when I can (who wants to move garden rocks with me this weekend!). I also walk whenever I can. Like, actually walk to the store or the bar or my friends houses if I can make it in a reasonable amount of time. When I worked in an office I always too the stairs, even when I worked on the 20th floor. \nI care more about my health than my looks. When I worked in an office I’d go to the gym for lunch and do a quick washcloth bath afterwards, never a full shower. I kept my hair simple and my makeup light because my lunch hour was too short to get in a good work out AND look pretty afterwards. \n\nI don’t workout as much as I did when I was younger but my goals have changed so that’s ok. But I just turned 40 and I can still do a couple of pushups and jog a mile without really trying.\n\n## Comment ID jltw23p with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltw23p/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nChoose activities you actually enjoy and would look forward to doing.

Consistency doesn’t mean perfection, but that you get it right most of the time. \n\nWeight training is important for women as we age because it, along with other factors helps prevent osteoporosis and other age-related issues. It will help you recover faster from injuries as well as help prevent them - of course as long as you use proper form and don’t lift too heavy of weights before you have built the strength to do so. \n\n Genetics plays a big role in how you age and what your body looks like, however eating a healthy diet of lean protein, veggies, carbs, and fats will give whatever genetics you have a boost. I know I will never have skinny legs, it’s just not in my genetics. If fat bottom girls make the rockin’ world go ‘round, my family is doing their part. I try not to beat myself up about it, which I will admit is sometimes really hard.  \n\nI cycle through periods of calorie restriction (fat loss) and maintenance, where I get to enjoy foods I love that aren’t healthy (but are good for the soul) - you can’t and shouldn’t live your life on a “diet” or in a state of calorie restriction for many reasons (quality of life, metabolic adaptation, etc.)  \n\nI leave room in my life for the good-for-the-soul foods most of the year, and restrict my calories for a short time when I feel I need to. I have been generally  able to keep visible abs year round without killing myself (again see my comment about genetics! And that wasn’t always the case!) I found an diet and exercise program that works for me (Renaissance Periodization). I lift weights and do some amount of cardio 5-6 days per week. I genuinely love lifting, I love how it has transformed my body and I love how strong I am. Lifting gives me a sense of accomplishment and makes me feel powerful. But I also know that not everyone loves lifting and that is totally ok. Find something you love and stick with it\n\nDrink water, get good quality rest, lift weights, eat (mostly) healthy, whole foods and stay consistent.\n\n## Comment ID jlvwzre with +2 score by [(Anna-Belly, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlvwzre/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nMovement!

So making sure you eat the right quantity for you in some form is key, whether that's keto, intermittent fasting, or just having a handle on your overall intake. Other than that,  focusing on building muscle through strength training also helps metabolism (and motivation because you'll feel strong). Protein intake helps build muscle so that's important too. And staying active with walking or other activity outside the gym.\n\nFor me the biggest motivator is finding a way to strength train that always has me chasing a little more - a new skill, a new PR, or even just moving the same weight but better. I work with a coach right now who programs for me in a way I like but there are tons of good online programs too. That chase keeps me really consistent because I like the feeling of always having something to work towards.\n\n## Comment ID jltu7st with +2 score by [(sittinginthesunshine, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltu7st/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI always stayed active by walking, but I truly got fit after 40!

It's absolutely not. I was a chubby child through my early teens. It took a concerted effort for me to lose weight in high school, which I did by walking and jogging a lot. It takes discipline and consistency for me to not regain weight.\n\nThe physique I have now is due to a combination of intense workouts and a great diet, but it' mostly my diet. I'm able to maintain my lean frame (just not my biceps) through just walking a lot (I have dogs) and eating intentionally.\n\nI intermittent fast (loosely) and do cardio at 6am on an empty stomach. I eat a green smoothie for lunch practically every day of my life unless I'm traveling. Then, I limit snacking in between meals. I'll have a *planned* snack or two in between lunch and dinner but I never graze. Dinner is a salad with lean protein several days per week, some type of burger (turkey/salmon/impossible, rarely beef) with salad or roasted veggies once or twice, then pasta or pizza with salad/roasted veggies the other days. This is the carb/calorie cycling method where I eat at maintenance or slightly under it based on my TDEE (google it) and then spike my carbs and calories a few days a week to refuel and stabilize hunger hormones, facilitate muscle growth and repair.\n\nYou have to care about and enjoy this stuff, however. I like being active, I find healthy food delicious, and I also like to eat huge portions, so intermittent fasting lets me do this without gaining weight. There's something to be said for finding what works for you, but as another commenter said, knowing your energy needs (i.e. how many calories and what nutrients your body requires to function) and meeting these, plus being physically active go a long way to keeping a person fit as they age. You just have to make it a priority which many people cannot or won't do, especially women. This goes double for moms, so it's worthwhile for me to acknowledge that I don't have kids and my body has never undergone pregnancy or childbirth.\n\n## Comment ID jluhpu0 with +2 score by [(Eva_De_Peva, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jluhpu0/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nFor me it has been playing capoeira, taking daily 30 minute lunch walks, and bikepacking.

Whether that's yoga, rebounding, walking, lifting etc. you will have a baseline no matter what. \n\nAnd then eliminating foods that don't serve you for more healthful whole options. Lots of fresh fruits and veggies-- remember muscles are built from glucose not protein. Less fats burdening your liver which starts to slow down now (leads to sluggishnness, weight gain and things we see as \"aging\").\n\nAnd lastly good sleep and good hydration!\n\n## Comment ID jlunudt with +2 score by [(HellGoddessHG, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlunudt/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI had twins and weighed 250.

The goal is to naturally transition into a whole foods way of eating such that it isn't a \"diet\". \n\nWalk 10,000+ steps a day most days. A 45 minute to one hour walk is about 10,000 steps for me. \n\nStay active throughout the day. Set a timer on your phone to walk around the office, do squats and calf lifts, or whatever you can and feel comfortable doing every half hour to an hour. Do NOT sit in a chair for 4+ hours straight. \n\nTake up some active hobbies that you can do after work and/or on weekends. Bouldering, cycling, hiking, running etc have relatively low barriers to entry and are more fun (to me) than the gym.

I do both Orangetheory (it’s my social time after working from home) and walks/runs (I love being outside). My dog is 15 and she still goes on walks every day and looks half her age and still gets puppy energy. I hope my body feels younger as I age just by moving it. \n\nFor nutrition, it’s also remembering how crappy I feel when I consistently don’t eat well. I’m a big believer in being able to eat what you want as long as you don’t eat too large of portions and having a variety of food. That’s when I feel my best. I’m an over eater by nature so I go through waves of it but I go crazy if I put huge limitations on myself. And weighing/measuring my food stresses me out. This works for a lot of people but not me. So again, finding what works for you. \n\nWhat motivates me is remembering how tired and lazy I felt before starting OT and I don’t want to feel that way again. Starting my day with a walk energizes me for the day and doing OT after work gives me an outlet for my stress. And start small. No need to make yourself start working out five days a week.

The best approach is what you can do and what you can sustain over the long term. I do not recommend any fad diets at all. I also do not recommend anything that's super restrictive or requires you spend money on plans, specific food, supplements, etc. \n\nThe reason why it needs to be sustainable is because investing in your health and fitness now and making it a lifelong habitat will benefit you for your entire life, and you'll really see that happens when you're in your 50s. That's when your habits start to catch up to you and the impact of your lifestyle really makes itself felt.\n\nFor cred: I'm 43 and while I no longer run marathons or do triathlons, I still hike, mountain bike, do yoga and lift weights. I am not exactly rocking a six-pack but I'm healthy, energetic and capable of doing physical work. My husband has a similar lifestyle, and he's one of the very few 60-somethings I know who takes no medication and has had no health scares. It's very worth it to build these habits now!\n\n## Comment ID jlu60yg with +1 score by [(Person3847, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlu60yg/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nRegular, light exercise has been key for me. I work in healthcare with elderly patients and I am constantly reminded of the importance of maintaining strength, flexibility, and mobility as we age. That visual reminder helps keep me motivated, and a regular schedule helps me when I’m not motivated! It also helps with my mood and helps me to have more good days than bad days. It’s like a cycle, where I want to exercise on good days, and exercise helps me have more good days. \n\nAnd meal planning, so that my meals at home are healthy and consistent, helps so much.

I am mostly fit. I pretty much think it was being really athletic as a kid, taking dance classes, (still occasionally do), horseback riding (I still do that every week), sports and being outside running around all of the time. Just all around staying physically active. I have goats and chickens, so I regularly jump over fences, haul hay and 50lb sacks of feed around. When I walk, I walk fast. I stretch to keep my joints limber.\n\nAs for diet, I eat whatever I feel like eating whenever I feel like it, but compared to my friends, I seem to eat a lot less than they do...... but then, I also weigh a lot less. Interestingly, they all think they eat way less than I see that they actually do eat. I eat full fat, and sugar. No caffeine, not much alcohol. I never eat food with the words, \"low fat\", \"fat free\", \"diet\" or \"keto\" on them. I do eat fresh food that I make from scratch, and almost nothing processed. Never have. Fast food? Pretty much never. Breakfast is a no. I eat one large meal a day and snack on fruit or whatever....I graze. Big meal always has veg and whatever else I feel like.\n\nI am around 8lbs heavier than I'd like to be, (right now I am 5'2\" and 112lbs on a very small frame), but I'm too lazy to diet. You lose muscle as you get older and gain a tummy pretty much no matter how fit you are, but you also get more complacent about how you look as long as you feel good and are mostly healthy.\n\n## Comment ID jlu9t5s with +1 score by [(ZedZemM, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlu9t5s/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI gained some weight that stick since I turned 30.

I spend a LOT of time in the kitchen \n\n2) Weight lifting. I've found this is the most helpful for me. I love packing on the muscle and getting gains. \n\n3) Keeping temptation food out of the house. I have no willpower.

My Apple Watch records an average of 45 min of exercise 7 days a week.\n\nFood was a bigger challenge for me. I used to avoid planning meals and would just wing it at the grocery store. I also was very into using the Magnolia Cookbooks and any random recipe I found on Pinterest. Have you ever looked up a recipe out of desperation because you have two ingredients? Yeah, the solution is always to add pasta and cream cheese. I found the \"Skinny Taste\" cookbooks and website and everything changed.

You are way more capable than you give your body credit for and it’s awesome. Half the battle is mental. Psyching yourself out saying “I’ll never be a runner” or “I could ever do that it’s not who I am” literally you’d be surprised.

I am a huge believer in walking - people do not walk nearly enough, in my opinion.\n\nBut as a regular form of cardio, cycling just ticks off every box for me:  it gets you outside, it’s a fun way to explore the world (even if it’s “just” your local town), it feels like being a kid, and it burns a ton of calories.  There is a big sense of accomplishment in finishing a ride.  I hope to find a way to do it again.\n\nI also strength train.  I had to stop training for some time.

The other 20%, eat the “junk food” if you want, life is too short to not have the cookie. \nPrioritize protein in your meals. 30g per meal is a good amount to shoot for. \nPrioritize sleep. 7+ hours of night, consistently. \nFind a type of exercise you enjoy, and do it 3-4 times a week. Lifting weights is preferable, because building muscle mass is incredibly important as you age, but just keep moving! The human body WANTS to move. You’re more likely to stick to something you enjoy. \nWear sunscreen every day. \n\nIf you have any specific questions, I’m more than happy to answer!\n\n## Comment ID jlugtwh with +1 score by [(bon-aventure, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlugtwh/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\n38, Ive stayed active with walks, weightlifting and sports. Diet matters a lot more though and learning how to count calories early on helps. Keeping any weight gain in check by not allowing it to go beyond ten pounds over my ideal weight.\n\nI rarely eat out and exercise for about two hours a day and count calories every day, for years. It's not for everyone and it exhausts me and is probably borderline obsessive at this point, to be honest. \n\nWith that being said, hormonal changes have made weight loss extremely difficult lately and I'm basically only able to maintain a normal BMI with a lot of effort.

Incorporate some sort of weight bearing exercises to maintain bone density and raise your BMR. You don’t need to obsessively track calories but when food shopping or planning your meals for the week, start by selecting your proteins and try to meet your daily goal. Next you should think of good sources of fats and finally I find that carbs are in anything and everything and are mostly unavoidable so I don’t plan for them. \n\nIf that’s a lot to think of try to shop the perimeter of the grocery store or try to eat things that you can “look at and tell what it is” e.g. chicken breast, vegetables, rice, whole grains.

When I hit menopause in my late forties, I kinda fell into a funk and stopped everything and it showed. What works for me now:\n\nDiet:  I eat one big meal a day, usually lunch, and it's much easier for me than trying to eat a lot of little meals.  I don't really count calories but I go heavy on protein and fat, light on carbs, and try to always include something green.  \n\nI try to let myself get actually hungry before I eat, not starving, just hungry instead of munchy.  I find if I'm never hungry, I'm gaining weight.  If I get a little hungry in the evening, I'll have something small like pistachios or a cheese stick.\n\nExercise:  It's easier if you can find something social you enjoy.  I'm on a competitive rowing team, we train together and go to regattas.  If I don't feel like working out, I still do because my crew is counting on me.\n\nI started doing yoga online a couple of years ago and it's been great.  I do at least 30 min every evening, it's a great way to relax for bed and has really firmed up my arms.\n\nAlcohol:  I quit drinking entirely and my weight has dropped to it's lowest in my adult life (I was never all that overweight but maybe a bit chubby).

I dunno. Being healthy? Let me tell you what I do! I'm in my early 50s and I think I'm in good shape, at least as good as I was in my 20s, even though I'm a bit heavier now (5' 4.5\", hovering around 145 pounds, whereas at age 30 I was about 10 pounds lighter). My weight has been pretty stable since having kids, but I do occasionally diet to knock a few pounds off (5-10, which I can do in a month or two, then go back to normal).\n\nI've always walked a few miles most days. For a while in my 20s and 30s I did martial arts, which I enjoyed and was good for me socially. I did lose some fitness when my kids were young because of disrupted sleep and the stress of living with young kids and a man-child. A couple of years ago I took up running and now I run about 20 miles/week, which is great for my mental health as well as whatever it does physically. \n\nI do prioritize sleep -- I go to bed early-ish and wake up pretty early, too. I'm starting to prioritize eating more protein, but I don't have a very restrictive diet. On days when I don't do a long run, I generally stick to 3 meals/day and no significant snacks. I also cook, so most of my diet comes from \"real\" ingredients, rather than packaged convenience foods... but my kids (and my ex) like them so I'm not a purist. I ran a trail half marathon this morning and I just ate half a pint of Ben & Jerrys because I wanted it. \n\nBut yeah, stay active, do things you enjoy, sleep enough, and eat well.\n\nAlso I've cut way back on alcohol and avoiding alcohol makes a huge difference, too.\n\n## Comment ID jluuujc with +1 score by [(PeachyKeenest, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jluuujc/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nEating right - I got a nutritionist after awhile and proteins are the way to go.

For example, I have a friend that lost a ton of weight by becoming a marathon runner, she's competitive, so her main motivation was to keep running so she could do better in races. That worked for her, while I, someone who isn't competitive but is more goal oriented, just set weekly fitness goals. Stuff like go to the gym at least 3 times this week. \n\nConsidering how I get a hit of dopamine by accomplishing weekly goals, and how my friend gets a hit of dopamine when her run is a little bit faster, the secret to finding a healthy lifestyle that works for you is figuring out what healthy activities and habits release dopamine in your brain. The reason this is important because dopamine also motivates us to take action, its not only the reward.\n\nSo if the investment in our health is something that genuinely makes us happy, it is easier to be motivated to maintain that investment. At first it will be hard, because your brain may be more motivated to do unhealthy things, and it will take some experimentation to find an activity or diet that you enjoy. However once you figure out what works for you and you start sticking to it consistently, maintaining a healthy lifestyle gets easier and easier.  \n\n\nI like to say eating healthy and working out isn't hard. What's hard is changing your lifestyle.\n\n## Comment ID jlv7qld with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlv7qld/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nWhat do you mean by 'looking healthy'?\n\n## Comment ID jlv84n3 with +1 score by [(StrawberryKiss2559, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlv84n3/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI did nothing different than my 20s.

I packed on weight, had blood sugar issues and skin tags on my neck that were indicating pre diabetes, and I was suffering from lots of reflux, aches pains and inflammation. It got to the point where some days the inflammation was so bad I could barely walk, and nearly everything I ate or drank would result in days of reflux/heartburn - so I had to make big change. At first I went to the doctor and they put me on anti inflammatory meds which helped with inflammation, but made the reflux worse and I started to develop a stomach ulcer. I got cranky about taking drugs that made things worse, went on a research frenzy, and decided to address it myself with diet and exercise. My whole body has changed in the last eight months. I started on a vegan diet, but not strictly, about 70-80% of the time. I find if it’s too strict I get annoyed and abandon it, so now my motto is being good most of the time. This helped reduce the inflammation. I would say I experienced about 80% reduction in pain and inflammation within days of going vegan. I stopped drinking alcohol too, and stuck to a vegan diet for about 3 months. It helped get me to the point where I could start thinking about exercise bc before that I was in so much pain it would not have been possible. After a while on vegan diet I noticed that I was overeating and the blood sugar issues were not improving. I was ravenous and always prowling in the kitchen, so I decided to go mostly keto as it’s as clear I was still on a blood sugar spike and drop cycle. I started drinking a Yerba mate supplement in the mornings to help manage blood sugar and suppress cravings and it made a huge difference. I now usually don’t eat breakfast, I have a Yerba mate and have my first keto meal at midday, and my dinner - also keto - at around 5pm. After being on keto 70-80% of the time for a month I was losing so much weight that I had to increase my calories bc I was getting stretch marks (I hadn’t had any since I was a teen and I forgot how much they hurt!). So if I am out of my house now I eat whatever I like and drink alcohol, but at home it’s keto only. Weight loss wasn’t the goal but since going mostly keto I’ve dropped close to 14kg. When I went keto I also started doing reformer Pilates twice a week, and I try to walk more. Pilates has made a world of difference, I feel so strong and I stand taller. I realised I don’t like pointless walking, so I make sure to book social events where I have enough time to walk into the city after work (about 40min - an hour once or twice a week). It feels like I can maintain this forever and continue to add new good habits to this baseline I’ve created. I’m still losing weight but much more slowly, and I don’t feel deprived. I wish I had started this younger. There’s so much advice and many opinions on what you should do - it’s confusing. I had to try a few things and see what worked for me bc we are all a little different. I have ADHD which means that unless I love something or it’s purposeful (exercise) I won’t stick with it, and ordering pre-cooked keto meals saves me time money and food waste. I would have loved to stay vegan morally, but I just couldn’t make it work for my body long term and I’m glad I listened to my body.\n\n## Comment ID jlvusmv with +1 score by [(MongooseInCharmeuse, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlvusmv/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nWeight lifting & rucking (walking increasing distances while increasing weight).

As I got older I got tired much quicker throughout the days and it's easy to get into the mindset of 'I'll do it tomorrow' in terms of healthy eating and exercise. But I've wavered enough times to remember the feeling of being sick and unwell from a bad diet and how much less pain I'm in when I eat well and exercise. So I always make sure my mindset is clear and put lots of willpower into looking after myself. If you don't feel like you have willpower, literally sternly tell yourself out loud 'you ARE going to do it, and you ARE going to feel great after' and just propel yourself along to whatever your fitness goals are. If you tell yourself you're too tired (or can't be bothered) you effectively talk yourself into not doing it when in reality you can. Even if you fail after 2 minutes, it's better to do that than never to have tried at all. This has kept me mentally at my happiest and at my physical peak. \n\n - Also calories in Vs calories out is vital for fitness goals, exercise can be as hard or light as you want depending on what your personal goals are.\n\n## Comment ID jlvz9r7 with +1 score by [(Mor_Tearach, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlvz9r7/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nHonestly?

I know people who flourish on intermittent fasting, keto and quite restrictive diets. I can not. I realised I’m a volume eater, so I do really well on a Mediterranean diet - unlimited whole grains, legumes, fruit, veg, some dairy, fish a couple of times a week, red meat once or twice a month, some chicken but a whole lot of vegetarian days.  I lost so much weight I had to reintroduce cake, though I tried to make ones with nutritional value (fruit, nuts, various grain flours), but real sugar and butter. \n\nMeal planning and meal prepping were essential for me to stick to it, I never had to cook very much during my work week, I was allowed to snack as much as I wanted, but it had to be substantial and nutritious, so if I was emotional eating I’d get full too quickly and stop. So I kept a variety of foods to meet these snacking requirements in the house. \n\nI also worked a non-sedentary job (nursing) and took the stairs. I wasn’t OTT with working out, but I did press ups and sit ups a couple of times a week, went swimming or trail walking once or twice a week and walked around the block if I felt like I needed some activity. \n\nThen I had kids, had a whole bunch of food aversions while pregnant, have much less time and have to cook family meals and kids go too slow to get a good brisk walk in.

      "# [On offense: Proactively personalizing medicine to optimize health](https://pharmacy.osu.edu/news/offense-proactively-personalizing-medicine-optimize-health)\nLaura Lile, MD, RPh, BS Pharm ’87, a dual-credentialed physician and clinical pharmacist, is nationally sought after for her proactive approach to preventative health and wellness – primarily using genomics.\n\n“I started down this path for my own family because we have extremely high cardiovascular and stroke risk,” Dr. Lile said. “I wanted to see my mom and dad be able to live a longer life, rather than losing them at 70 years old, which was common in my family history.”\n\nDr. Lile’s career has always been in the details.\n\nAfter her mom had a heart attack at a young age, Dr. Lile began looking into epigenetics to understand what she could do to improve her mom’s health. However, she wanted to go further – asking ‘what is the root cause of the disease or condition that patients are experiencing?’\n\nNow, through her practice, Lile Wellness Partners, Dr. Lile partners with patients to provide precise and comprehensive insights into their genetic makeup through IntellxxDNA™ testing. In addition, she uses bloodwork as the primary basis for following trend analysis of patients – both healthy and unhealthy. The Lile Wellness team can then tinker with medicine and supplement regimens to attain optimal health for their patients’ individual needs.\n\n“We practice offense medicine, not defense,” Dr. Lile said. “We believe in getting to the root cause of a disease state or condition. Rather than treating the condition only, we look at what may be causing it, such as lifestyle or genetic predispositions, to optimize a patient’s health.”\n\nGenomic testing allows patients to understand their genome and then dial in to very specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to see their risk factors for certain conditions and disease states. Pharmacists and physicians can then use that information to understand how to work around those SNPs. Using the gene variants, the health care team can modify risk using targeted medicine and supplements and then monitor the patient’s response through bloodwork.\n\n“We use these reports to analyze genes that are present in very low percentages in the population, less than 5% to 10%. We question why these genes still exist in someone's gene pool while the rest of the world has evolved and gotten rid of them” Dr. Lile said. “We then take a deep dive into the research to see what those genes have a higher risk of causing. In isolation, these gene variants are helpful to know, but without the IntellxxDNA™ tool and the evidence-based recommendations that it provides, it can be scary to know you carry a high-risk gene. These clinical decision tools remove that fear because now we can decipher how to override that part of your genome.”\n\nDr. Lile says that PharmDs are the perfect health care practitioners to perform the complex work of interpreting a genomic test, due to their expertise in the usage of medicine and accessibility to patients.\n\n“To use this tool effectively, you don’t need to prescribe medicine. You are guiding patients with a clinical tool to understand their genome and the why behind disease states like diabetes or depression. You can provide them with a powerful tool that can be refreshed on a routine basis, putting the pharmacist in an excellent position to be the patient’s health care advocate. Genomic tools can expand the role of the pharmacist.”\n\nHer strong belief that pharmacists can play a vital role in this process led Dr. Lile to invite four Ohio State PharmD students to an IntellxxDNA™ conference in the summer of 2023. She felt that it was her pharmacy training – not her medical training – that enabled her to understand the extremely complex reports she receives through genetic testing.\n\nOne of the students who attended the conference, Class of 2024 PharmD candidate, Kate Pollock, has continued her work with Dr. Lile and will join the Lile Wellness team upon her graduation in May 2024 as the first full-time PharmD in the clinical practice who will see patients and complete consults, rather than filling prescriptions.\n\nEven before tools like IntellxxDNA™, Dr. Lile had been using patients’ bloodwork markers to narrow in on improving health outcomes. However, the IntellxxDNA™ report, provides an immediate roadmap to optimal health outcomes without having to guess what’s going on with only some of the information.\n\n“I’ve spent years tweaking medications and supplements in patients to ensure that I see the responses in their blood work that I expect to see. While I’ve been doing this for years, I now have a clinical decision support tool that can get patients to optimal medication support on day one because we know exactly what their body needs.”\n\nDr. Lile and Pollock both attest to the benefits that their patients are seeing through this DNA-targeted precision-based medicine approach.\n\n“It has been great to meet with patients at their follow-up visits and hear how they’ve been able to participate in things like hiking or exercise that they weren’t able to before the testing,” Pollock said. “Patients are seeing progress on their health goals faster because we are able to tailor their body’s unique needs to them.”\n\nThey both also say the key to this type of intervention being used more widely is for pharmacists to continue to advocate for the profession.\n\n“The power of this tool can exponentially expand the role of pharmacists,” Dr. Lile said. “Pharmacists understand this complex medication and supplement-related data and use it to advocate for, and partner with, our patients. We need to identify the skill sets and value that we have as pharmacists to be a part of the solution. We’ve been doing it for years – pharmacists have always been the trusted healthcare professional, especially in rural communities that routinely experience a shortage of doctors. This is a natural progression for the profession of pharmacy.”",
      "# [Sait Tunc receives NSF CAREER award to optimize health care systems for equitable outcomes on 2024-04-05](https://news.vt.edu/articles/2024/04/tunc-career-award.html)\nIn an effort to revolutionize the health care system through operations research and systems engineering, Sait Tunc, an assistant professor in the Grado Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, has received a National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award.\n\nThe CAREER program supports early career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education and lead advances in the missions of their department or organization. This five-year grant totaling $568,619 will support Tunc’s research on inefficiencies in health care systems, particularly with respect to organ transplants. And it couldn’t be more timely.\n\nTunc’s research regarding organ utilization comes at a pivotal time in the industry. While organ scarcity exists, there is also a significant level of underutilization. Roughly 25 percent of organs recovered from deceased donors go unused for a variety of reasons. Patients may refuse organ offers because they come from a relatively higher risk donor, or they may choose to wait to see if another “better” organ becomes available. Additionally, patients with access to higher quality health care may receive special priority.\n\n“I want to identify disadvantaged patients and improve their access to organs. Federal law prevents penalizing patients for rejecting organ offers, which creates a gap between what is optimal for the individuals and how they behave. One mechanism I developed identifies disadvantaged patient groups who have reduced access to organs, thus a higher mortality rate,” Tunc said.\n\nIn addition to matching organs to recipients more efficiently, Tunc also wants to ensure equitable access for all in need. Perhaps surprisingly, this means taking into consideration voluntary incentive mechanisms, which prioritize motivating patients based on data rather than removing the option of choice. For example, instead of mandating participation, such as forcing a patient to accept an organ of relatively lower quality, voluntary incentive mechanisms give patients agency by showing them why they could reject an organ, but why they’d be better off accepting it rather than, say, remaining on dialysis.\n\n“We use data modeling to prioritize these patients for organ offers that are most beneficial to them. This improves the match between donors and recipients and addresses the issue of organ underutilization,” Tunc said. “The challenge in organ procurement is not just about finding more donors, but ensuring that the organs are used efficiently and equitably. I want to bridge the gap between what is best for society and how individuals behave.”\n\nIncentivizing healthy behavior\n\nVoluntary incentive mechanisms work at large-scale and individual levels, and Tunc’s research addresses both. He investigates how these strategies lead to an increase in wellness-related behaviors, such as exercise or tobacco cessation. This aspect of his proposal aims to encourage healthier behaviors considering that not everyone has the same level of delay discounting and using someone’s willingness to adopt healthier activities based on what reward they would receive if they change their habits.\n\n“My primary goal with this research is to design and implement voluntary incentive mechanisms in the health care field, for both organizations and individuals,” Tunc said. “Rather than use coercion or mandated participation, voluntary incentive mechanisms encourage participants through rewards. These tend to make implementing new strategies easier compared to traditional approaches in health care and improve outcomes at the individual, organizational, and societal levels.”\n\nUsing voluntary incentive mechanisms, Tunc’s research seeks to\n\nAlleviate the burden of organ scarcity, reduce the size of the transplant waiting list, improve the access of marginalized groups to transplants, and mitigate waitlist deaths\n\nPartner with Organ Procurement Organizations to expand organ availability and overall procurement\n\nReduce disparities in transplant access, especially for those at a significant disadvantage, including older patients and patients of color\n\nAlign individual actions with societal health goals, promote healthy behaviors, and improve long-term health outcomes especially among those most in need, such as individuals living with addiction or obesity\n\nAs part of the National Science Foundation’s support for educational outreach, the impacts of Tunc’s award will span from undergraduate engineering students to medical professionals, including a partnership with Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Virginia State University (VSU).\n\nHealth care providers can adjust their response to patients based on their willingness to adopt healthier behaviors. Tunc is hopeful this strategy will encourage people to adopt healthier habits while feeling they have choices in their decision making.\n\n“It’s crucial to design programs that actually motivate people to adopt healthier behaviors by considering all these individual differences in delay discounting, which explains why some people might not find long-term rewards as enticing. People that show addictive behavior, for example, are typically associated with higher delay discounting,” Tunc said. “This will enable researchers to find strategies that work for different groups.”\n\nThe future of health care systems\n\nTunc plans to use this research as an opportunity to educate others on how operations research and systems engineering and the use of voluntary incentive mechanisms can be beneficial for those working in the health care field, including short courses for medical students on implementing voluntary incentive mechanisms, and research education that will benefit undergraduate and graduate students at Virginia Tech and beyond.\n\n\"Our partnership with VSU is quite detailed, providing summer undergraduate research assistantship opportunities for VSU students at Virginia Tech, and offering an in-person opportunity for them to engage with groups in our department and elsewhere at the university,” Tunc said. “We hope we can engage students from multiple backgrounds and disciplines to participate, and encourage them to consider health care-related studies.”\n\nTunc’s grant-related research has informed his curriculum, including two new graduate level courses addressing health systems. Looking even further, Tunc hopes the research will impact policymakers from the top down while solving this complex global challenge.\n\n\"Beyond the direct educational interventions, the outreach activities associated with this research aim for policy change at the national level,” Tunc said. “Engaging with key stakeholders and policymakers ensures that the outcomes of this research are understood and potentially integrated into the national health care system.”",

The collaboration combines PatchRx's patented medication adherence technology and Optimize Health's remote patient monitoring platform to give providers unparalleled insight into a patient's history, medication-taking behaviors, and response to treatment — ultimately minimizing adverse outcomes and reducing unnecessary costs.\n\nMedication non-adherence costs the U.S. healthcare system over $100 billion annually due to avoidable hospitalizations, increased service utilization, unnecessary pharmacy costs, and diagnostic testing. For patients with chronic and complex conditions, the risk of non-adherence is especially profound, accounting for up to 25% of medication-related hospitalizations, and 125,000 deaths every year in the U.S. Despite this pervasive challenge, most healthcare providers today lack the tools to effectively compare a provider's recommended medication therapy with the patient's actual medicine-taking behavior. This partnership gives providers an unparalleled view into previously inaccessible health data for some of their most vulnerable patient populations, empowering better treatment outcomes and reducing unnecessary costs.\n\n\"Utilization of telehealth and remote-first care took off in 2020 and has stabilized at levels 38X higher than pre-pandemic. As patients increasingly embrace remote care, healthcare providers are looking for ways to seamlessly monitor treatment outside of the traditional clinical setting,\" said Andrew Aertker, co-founder and CEO of PatchRx. \"Our partnership with Optimize Health brings together often fragmented point solutions to deliver a truly comprehensive model of remote monitoring, setting the standard for a healthier, more cost-effective future.\"\n\nPatchRx was founded in 2018 to address one of the most pressing challenges in healthcare today: medication adherence. The company's patented, smart pill-bottle technology has gained widespread adoption, improving care outcomes for thousands of patients across the U.S. The unique cap fits on the underside of any size pill bottle, gathering information securely for the patient and the patient's care team. As the adoption of Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM), Remote Therapeutic Monitoring (RTM), and Chronic Care Management (CCM) technologies continues to grow, PatchRx is well-positioned for continued momentum in 2024.\n\n\"Remote monitoring serves as a lifeline for patients who need consistent oversight,\" said Ryan Clark, CEO of OptimizeHealth. \"We know that healthcare doesn't stop at the clinic door, and by providing continuous monitoring solutions, we offer patients peace of mind and providers the tools they need to act quickly to help patients effectively manage potentially debilitating chronic conditions.\"\n\nTo learn more about PatchRx and its patented medication adherence technology, visit PatchRx.io.\n\nAbout PatchRx\n\nPatchRx is revolutionizing patient care through its clinically-backed medication adherence technology.

      "# [How generative AI can optimize health care supply chains by authorfirstname:Ryan, authorlastname:Siemers, authorjobtitle:Managing Director, Ernst & Young LLP, authorurl:https:, www.ey.com, ryan-siemers, authorfirstname:Sezin, authorlastname:Palmer, sezin-palmer](https://www.ey.com/en_us/insights/health/how-generative-ai-can-optimize-health-care-supply-chains)\nRisk management\n\nAI can help health care providers effectively manage risk and build resiliency for specific geographies or groups of providers, and proactively alert and course-correct for disruptions automatically. The technology can analyze current and historical data involving inventory levels, patient case levels, geopolitical events and weather, for example.\n\nSome organizations rely on prepopulated dashboards fed by this data, and alerts and course corrections for disruptions can be triggered automatically. GenAI can be queried to produce risk assessments, scenario simulations and mitigation strategies on demand — in response to shortages or widespread calamities, such as another pandemic — to help planners manage and mitigate the risks proactively.\n\nSourcing\n\nThe health care industry has more sophisticated IT systems today, with vast amounts of data. As mentioned, being able to accurately analyze data around cost, quality and outcomes can help physicians determine the best supplies or drugs to use depending on patient needs.\n\nBy considering these factors as well as supplier performance and risk profiles, GenAI algorithms can provide recommendations or rankings for making informed decisions for a health care system’s sourcing strategy. Furthermore, supply chain functions can use this information to facilitate product standardization and utilization efforts among categories of supplies.\n\nEquipment optimization and inventory management\n\nUS providers struggle to effectively optimize how well costly diagnostic or treatment equipment — such as MRIs, CTs, PET scans and proton therapy — is used across a particular market, geography or even within a health system. Providers can take a page from the playbook of manufacturers to leverage AI to get the most out of their equipment. GenAI could more effectively match supply with demand and automatically schedule patients to optimize the utilization of these limited resources.\n\nAnd in the operating room, GenAI can help revolutionize how preference cards — used by physicians to note which supplies and instruments are needed for a surgery — are managed. Instead, imagine a system in which GenAI makes recommendations for preference card updates based on historic usage patterns, the patient profile/demographic, case types, physician and forecast – and then automatically updates the preference cards based on the approvals from reviewers. In the process, a hospital optimizes inventory and ensures that all supplies are ready and on time for every case.\n\nDistribution and logistics\n\nGenAI can continually update and optimize delivery or pickup routes based on changing factors like traffic conditions, weather and the priority of deliveries. This could be a boon for the US health care sector, which is responsible for about 5% of national greenhouse emissions¹, partly because of its transportation footprint within the supply chain, including the driving by patients and employees. AI can also play a role in more effectively routing patients to the most appropriate and closest care setting, which would be a win-win for the patients and the providers.\n\nAnd thanks to advances in telemedicine adoption during the pandemic, that setting may be in the patient’s home — however, many providers lack the proper infrastructure. They may struggle to determine how to get the right supplies and caregivers to the patient, as well as fulfill the reverse logistics for lab samples and returned equipment. GenAI can be leveraged to recommend logistics partners and create routes based on time, criticality, distance, cost and other variables.\n\nGet started today\n\nWhile GenAI is a powerful tool with certain limitations, it is not a strategy. Focus on the business value and define a roadmap to shape and impact the organization, guided by three steps:\n\n1. Assess data quality, integrity and management.\n\nSupply chain has a lot of systems in play without much standardization. But data is the core of a successful GenAI platform, and many health care organizations are relatively immature in these capabilities while also facing greater regulation than many other sectors, making strong governance a high priority. How are you cleansing, synthesizing and maintaining data? Do you have the data integrity and common structure to build advanced analytics on that data?\n\n2. Create a matrix of possibilities.\n\nProofs-of-concept can focus on use cases with low complexity but high value, deployed in an iterative and agile manner. Narrowly tailor these quick wins with an understanding that they require experimentation and won’t be perfect right from the start. However, know that the truly transformative power of GenAI can typically be unlocked when you design processes around it, not vice versa.\n\n3. Build out the infrastructure with your people in mind.\n\nIn parallel with your proofs-of-concept and quick wins, work toward a more strategic view, building the capabilities that can be shared across the organization. Drive training and development on GenAI with strong change management, so that your staff and caregivers understand that the technology is augmenting, not replacing, their jobs.",
