      "# [Optimize Health](https://optimize.health/blogs/)\nCCM Physician Type/Specialty RPM\n\nHow ACOs Can Leverage Chronic Disease Management Software\n\nThe recently finalized Advanced Primary Care Management (APCM) codes in CMS’s 2025 Physician Fee Schedule mark a pivotal shift in supporting value-based care for primary and chronic care patients. This move by CMS strengthens primary care through bundled services that streamline the administrative processes associated with managing chronic conditions, improve patient care continuity, and provide an opportunity to expand Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) services. As RPM and Chronic Care Management (CCM) have shown, providing ongoing support for patients with chronic conditions can enhance outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Now, with the introduction of APCM codes, providers can leverage a simplified, patient-centered approach while supporting advanced primary care models. Understanding the New APCM Codes CMS’s finalized APCM services introduce three new HCPCS G-codes to cover varying levels of patient complexity without the constraints of time-based billing. Here’s a breakdown of these new codes and what they mean for providers: G0556 (Level 1): For patients with one chronic condition, offering a baseline reimbursement rate that has been recently increased in response to stakeholder feedback. G0557 (Level 2): For patients with two or more chronic conditions, providing a higher reimbursement. G0558 (Level 3): For patients with two or more chronic conditions and designation as a Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB), reflecting higher complexity due to social determinants of health and access challenges. Unlike traditional CCM and other care management codes, these APCM codes eliminate time-based thresholds, making them more accessible for practices while reducing administrative burdens. How APCM Codes Transform Care Delivery The APCM codes represent more than just new billing opportunities—they support a fundamental transformation in how primary care is delivered. Practices using APCM codes can provide comprehensive, continuous care through essential service elements, including: 24/7 Access to Care: Ensuring patients have continuous access to urgent care services. Continuity of Care: Offering a designated team member for routine appointments, fostering stronger patient relationships. Enhanced Care Transitions and Coordination: Helping patients navigate care transitions smoothly, improving outcomes and reducing readmissions. Patient-Centered Comprehensive Care Plans: Managing care through individualized plans available to both patients and providers. Incorporating these elements within APCM provides a framework that supports high-quality, accessible, and proactive primary care. The codes align with CMS’s commitment to improving health outcomes and health equity by simplifying billing requirements, reducing documentation demands, and expanding primary care access for complex patients. Synergy Between APCM and Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) One of the most exciting aspects of APCM is its compatibility with RPM and Remote Therapeutic Monitoring (RTM). By using APCM to manage primary care services, practices can apply all time-based activities previously attributed to CCM directly to RPM codes. This means: Maximized RPM Reimbursement: Since RPM activities are not part of APCM billing, practices can focus RPM time on activities like monitoring vital signs and patient reminders, optimizing RPM billing opportunities. Streamlined Workflows: With APCM managing chronic care activities without time tracking, RPM can function without overlaps or time splits, simplifying workflows. Improved Patient Engagement: Patients benefit from consistent engagement through RPM, with clinicians using APCM to provide integrated support for a wide range of care needs. Why Now is the Time for Practices to Adopt APCM and RPM With finalized APCM codes, practices can now benefit from a hybrid payment model that reduces the burden of tracking every minute while still delivering quality, comprehensive care. Here’s why providers should consider adopting APCM codes alongside RPM: Reduced Administrative Burden: By replacing time-based requirements, APCM offers a more flexible, streamlined billing process. Improved Profitability and Patient Reach: APCM opens opportunities to include more patients in care management programs, especially those who may not have qualified under time-based CCM or PCM codes. Support for Socially Complex Patients: The Level 3 code provides additional reimbursement for patients facing social and economic barriers, aligning with CMS’s goals to improve health equity. Integrated Value-Based Care Model: The combination of APCM and RPM supports CMS’s vision of a value-based healthcare system, where patient outcomes are prioritized and healthcare costs are reduced. Realizing APCM’s Full Potential with Optimize Health As a leader in remote care, Optimize Health understands the challenges and opportunities of delivering advanced care management.

      "# [Technology Requirements for Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)](https://blog.optimize.health/software_hardware_rpm)\nAs remote patient monitoring has evolved from a nice-to-have to a must-have for practices that want to deliver continuous care and improve outcomes, so have the number of RPM solutions. So how do you determine which platform has the features that you really need? This blog dives into the most important technology requirements to consider when evaluating RPM platforms.\n\nSet-up and Security\n\nEasy patient setup – A good RPM solution should allow a patient to be easily added and set up in the platform in just a few steps. As your RPM program scales, you will want to make sure your solution makes it easy to add patients and grow your RPM program without overburdening your team.\n\nSecurity, and Compliance – Many patients lack confidence their health information remains private. Making your patients feel comfortable using their devices is critical to driving engagement. RPM companies that are committed to the highest levels of safety and security will go beyond HIPAA requirements and seek HITRUST Certification–the industry standard for security and privacy.\n\nClear Workflows and Communication Tools\n\nClinical Insights – Your RPM platform should make it simple for your clinical team to prioritize patient needs. You should be able to set custom thresholds for each reading type such as diastolic and systolic blood pressure. The platform should automatically send alerts when a patient has an out of threshold reading so you always know who needs immediate help. In addition, many solutions use visual notifications to help you analyze trends and intervene as soon as possible.\n\nPatient Engagement Tools – RPM is only successful when the monitoring team can engage with patients to build trusted relationships. This requires easy-to-use communication tools such as text messaging, click-to-call phone calls, and live video right in the RPM platform. In addition, a good solution will allow for two-way messaging, so that any time a patient responds to a text or calls you back, that you can take action right away.\n\nTime Tracking and Reimbursement Support – A strong RPM solution will automatically track patient engagement minutes, including synchronous versus asynchronous time. Look for solutions that make it easy to see which patients are on track for meeting billing requirements, such as 16 days of readings and 20-minutes of care team member time. If your care team needs flexibility for tracking time spent outside the system, such as calling from a personal cell phone, your platform should allow you to add those minutes.\n\nSeamless Patient Handoffs - You will likely have multiple clinicians monitoring patients, so it’s important that your RPM platform makes it easy to send and share patient notes, historical messaging, and care plans. This enables clinicians to seamlessly step in and provide care without missing important notes or action items.\n\nRecord Keeping – Medicare and insurance audits can happen. Your RPM platform should have the capability to track detailed utilization and easily provide the documentation that could be required to address any regulatory and compliance concerns.\n\nFlexible Technology\n\nCellular Devices – The best RPM platform only matters if patients are actually taking readings. For most practices, that means choosing simple, cellular devices. The easier a device is to use, the more often it will get used. While Bluetooth devices may offer additional features, they can be more challenging to use. Bluetooth devices require an internet connection, knowledge on how to pair and sync devices, and app updates to ensure readings are always synced to the RPM software.\n\nTechnical Support – A great solution will offer multiple technical support options to meet your needs. This could include self-service support articles or guides to help resolve minor issues, as well as the ability to talk to a real person when you need more help. Your solution should be open to product feedback and continuously improving the platform to meet your needs.\n\nConsidering Launching an RPM Program or Switching Vendors?",
      "# [Remote Healthcare on 2024-03-20](https://optimize.health/remote-healthcare/)\nHealthcare companies have developed healthcare software that provides remote health solutions using digital tools such as monitoring devices. These solutions allow medical service providers to track and test patients outside traditional healthcare settings, leading to better health services and improved patient outcomes.\n\nAt its core, remote healthcare involves monitoring tools and software platforms. Patient monitoring devices can track vital health metrics like blood pressure, blood glucose, and weight and automatically send that information to caregivers. This continuous monitoring allows providers to spot real-time health changes and potential issues. *Remote care* software platforms then aggregate all this data to give medical professionals a single view of each patient’s health status and progress.\n\nWith these insights, remote healthcare companies can proactively manage patient care plans. They can also easily coordinate care teams and communicate with patients and caregivers more effectively. As a result, providers can spend less time reacting to health crises and more time preventing issues and catching problems early. For patients, remote healthcare means convenience since they can receive routine check-ins, ask and answer questions, and adjust medication from the comfort of their own homes.\n\nRemote patient monitoring is typically used for managing chronic conditions. However, the benefits of remote healthcare extend to post-hospital care, complex disease management, and general population health. RPM companies continuously improve monitoring devices and software platforms, and that means remote care will become an even more critical component of how healthcare is delivered in the future.\n\nThe opportunities for improving outcomes and patient experience through remote healthcare solutions are endless. Remote monitoring programs that use wearable devices, mobile apps, and telehealth tools have the power to uncover new insights. They can detect health changes that traditional in-office visits miss.\n\nInnovative remote health companies are leading the way toward a future in which healthcare will undoubtedly include more virtual visits. It will also involve remote patient monitoring and software, which will enhance the capabilities of providers and care teams.\n\nRemote healthcare relies heavily on technology to provide remote health services to patients at home. With remote healthcare platforms, patients can access medical staff without visiting a doctor’s office. In addition, patients can get essential healthcare services and monitor chronic conditions from their homes.\n\nBy using such technology, healthcare providers gain tools that give them a better picture of a patient’s health between office visits. With this transformation of how patients access and receive medical care, medical staff can be more proactive in caring for patients and addressing issues before they become serious.\n\nSome examples of remote healthcare services include:\n\nTelemedicine: Patients have virtual consultations with doctors and specialists via video or phone instead of in-person visits. This allows patients to get medical advice and assistance from a distance.\n\nRemote patient monitoring: Patients with chronic conditions can use devices and sensors at home that transmit health data. Vital signs, such as blood pressure, pulse, and breathing rates, along with blood sugar levels and weight, are transmitted remotely to healthcare providers. This allows providers to monitor patients’ health between in-person checkups.\n\nePrescriptions: Doctors send prescriptions electronically to pharmacies instead of providing a physical piece of paper, which streamlines the process for patients to get their medications.\n\nOnline health assessments: Patients can complete health surveys and questionnaires online to assess their symptoms and overall health. This can help identify potential issues and direct them to the right provider or treatment options.\n\nVirtual therapists and counseling: Patients can connect with mental health providers through video calls and messaging apps to get emotional support and therapy from anywhere.\n\nOnline appointment scheduling: Patients can schedule and manage their appointments through an online portal or app connected to their healthcare provider, eliminating the need to call during office hours.\n\nRemote healthcare is more accessible and convenient for patients while helping providers improve the quality and effectiveness of their care. As technology progresses, it will continue to transform how patients interact with the entire healthcare system.\n\nRemote healthcare monitoring refers to using technology to monitor patients from a distance outside medical facilities. With remote health monitoring devices and systems, patients can receive care and track their health from home.\n\nIt helps achieve improved health outcomes by enabling early detection of health changes, reducing hospital readmissions, improving medication adherence, and streamlining follow-up care. This is done through a remote health monitoring system that sends patient health data to clinicians and care teams in close to real-time.\n\nSeveral remote healthcare monitoring systems and devices can monitor patients’ conditions from afar. They include the following:\n\nBlood Pressure Monitors: These are cuff-based monitors that patients can use at home to measure and transmit their blood pressure readings to their doctors. Doctors can monitor for high or low blood pressure issues.\n\nWeight Scales: Smart weight scales can measure a patient’s weight and body composition, then send that data wirelessly to their doctor or care team. This helps monitor for weight gain or loss issues.\n\nGlucose Monitors: Continuous glucose monitors use a small sensor inserted under the skin to constantly measure blood sugar levels in diabetic patients. They can transmit readings to an app for patients and doctors to monitor.\n\nECG Monitors: Electrocardiogram devices can measure a patient’s heart rhythm and electrical activity. The data is transmitted to doctors who can monitor for arrhythmias or other cardiac issues.\n\nOxygen Saturation Monitors: Pulse oximeters clip onto a patient’s finger to measure blood oxygen levels. Chronic conditions like COPD require frequent monitoring, so wireless oximeters send readings to doctors to detect issues early.\n\nActivity Trackers: Fitness trackers and smartwatches can track patients’ activity levels, steps, sleep, etc., and share that data with doctors to monitor mobility issues and functional decline.\n\nCameras/Sensors: In-home sensors and camera systems allow remote patient monitoring, which is particularly helpful for older adults and people with cognitive issues. Motion sensors can detect if a patient has fallen, and cameras can allow medical professionals to visually check in on high-risk patients.\n\nAll these remote health monitoring devices work like an early warning system. They alert clinicians about an anomaly before a small problem becomes a significant health issue.",

      "# [Managed RPM Services Help Staff Shortages on 2021-12-10](https://optimize.health/blog/staffing-shortages/)\nStaffing shortages are, unfortunately, nothing new for many healthcare organizations. Many pandemic-related factors, including increasing retirements and resignations from COVID-fatigue, have made the health care labor crisis worse. Add in increasing absences due to quarantine and illness, a reduction in foreign-educated nurses due to immigration limits, and highly-compensated “travel” RN positions, it’s not surprising that 16 percent of US hospitals had critical staffing shortages as of Oct 1. Staff shortages in healthcare are projected to reach 3.2 million by 2026.\n\nVaccine Mandates – Patient Benefits, Potential Staffing Challenges\n\nThe federal government has proposed a vaccine mandate requirement for Medicare and Medicaid participating healthcare providers that would cover more than 17 million healthcare workers.\n\nSome healthcare providers are concerned that this mandate could further fuel staffing shortages. While vaccine compliance rates have been high among healthcare workers, some executives fear that losing even a very small number of workers to mandates could have a significant impact.\n\nMany healthcare organizations, including the American Hospital Association (AHA), have advocated for vaccine mandates describing them as a “logical fulfillment of the ethical commitment of all healthcare workers to put patients as well as residents of long-term care facilities first.” Many large healthcare organizations, including Kaiser Permanente, have already implemented vaccine mandates and have retained over 99% of their staff. They have reported small numbers of employees lost to resignation or termination.\n\nThe AHA acknowledges that while vaccine mandates have many benefits, they could be difficult for smaller or more rural health systems that have limited sourcing options for nurses. Rural hospital executives concerned about having insufficient patient care staff have been reluctant to voluntarily implement mandates.\n\nProviders Need Innovative Staffing Solutions\n\nAs healthcare providers navigate the mandates, it’s clear they will need to be more resourceful and efficient in caring for patients. Even without mandates, staffing shortages will persist and any innovative solution that improves patient care with less staff should be considered. Some of these solutions may involve shifting the way care is delivered to appeal to a larger or different pool of clinical resources. For example, many nurses that have burned out on the hospital floor or in a physician practice, may be willing to consider returning to the field in a flexible, remote, part-time position.\n\nWhile it may be impractical for a physician’s office to hire and manage a part-time, remote nurse that only provides virtual care, they could outsource this function to a company that has a pool of remote nurses to serve exactly that function. This could allow a practice to dramatically expand the reach of their virtual care programs without adding to their current workload, or possibly even reducing the workload of in-office nurses.\n\nManaged RPM Can Help Alleviate Staffing Challenges\n\nRemote Patient Monitoring (RPM), a digital health solution that allows providers and their staff to monitor patients’ health from a distance, is a great place to start. Many RPM providers, including Optimize Health, offer managed RPM services where the RPM company provides outsourced nurses that act as an extension of your existing clinical staff team. This allows your practice to increase the direct clinical care time patients are receiving without directly hiring new staff, and may help reduce the number of routine patient calls your overworked nurses directly field on a daily basis.\n\nIf you are considering outsourcing or partnering with an RPM partner that provides nurses to assist with remote care services, what should you look for? We suggest conducting a virtual interview with your potential partner and ensuring the clinical staff not only demonstrates excellent clinical skills, but can effectively engage with patients in a virtual environment. Nurses working with patients in a virtual environment not only need to be comfortable with technology, they may need to be able to explain technology to patients as well. They also need a strong work ethic, an ability to work independently, and a passion for using motivational strategies to drive patient behavior changes.\n\nThe pandemic has fundamentally and permanently changed the way we deliver and receive services and healthcare is no exception. When implemented correctly, leveraging remote work and virtual care has the potential to both improve patient care and increase your staffing capacity.\n\nLearn More",
      "# [How RPM Can Help Manage Obesity](https://blog.optimize.health/rpm-obesity)\nObesity is a complex chronic health condition that can lead to poorer mental health outcomes, reduced quality of life, and increased risk for diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and some types of cancer.\n\nOne-third of Americans have obesity. Costs for all of the facets of medical care for obesity total $147 billion.\n\nManagement of obesity can have a wide variety of options ranging from nutrition to physical activity to surgical interventions. 50-70 percent of adults with obesity have tried to lose weight and national guidelines recommend 10 percent weight loss, but even 5 percent has shown health benefits.\n\nRPM Makes it Easy for Patients\n\nLosing weight and maintaining weight loss is difficult. Connected RPM scales equip patients with support for adherence in checking their weights, visualizing trends with weight over time.\n\nRPM removes the friction of patient compliance with daily weigh-ins, recording these numbers, and bringing them to their provider to discuss their progress with weight loss. Furthermore, the integration of the weight trend data into the provider platform allows for the health system to engage and reach out to patients who might be deviating from their weight goals.\n\nRPM allows providers to check in with patients with the context of their weight loss and support them with a supportive educational curriculum surrounding nutrition and physical activity.\n\nClinical Studies Show Benefits of Digital Technology\n\nA study published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) concluded that “Weighing every day led to greater adoption of weight control behaviors and produced greater weight loss compared with weighing most days of the week. This further implicates daily weighing as an effective weight loss tool.”\n\nAdditionally, a randomized controlled trial measured the efficacy of a telemedicine-based weight loss program with video conference health coaching support. The study found that clinically significant weight loss was achieved in 69.2 percent in the intervention group versus 8 percent in the control group.\n\nLearn More About RPM",

      "# [Q&A with Optimize Health Co-Founder, Jeff LeBrun](https://blog.optimize.health/qa-jeff-lebrun)\nJeff LeBrun is the Co-Founder of Pillsy and Optimize Health. After serving as CEO for 6+ years, Jeff recently shifted to a new role as Executive Chairman and Chief Strategy Officer. We asked Jeff a few questions about the origins of the company, the future of RPM, and why he is so passionate about RPM in our “Meet Jeff” blog post.\n\nYou have been involved with multiple start-ups over the course of your career. What was the motivation for starting Pillsy and how did the universe lead you to your co-founder, Chuks Onwuneme?\n\nThe idea for Pillsy evolved from a couple of different startups over the course of my career. At one of these startups, I was supporting some of the early wearable device companies. Interest in these devices grew as the companies began connecting them to the internet. It was easy for me to imagine the potential applications in healthcare and the value of continuous medical data.\n\nI also started a VC-backed biotech startup in graduate school, where I quickly learned how significant of a problem medication adherence is in the US. Only 50% of prescribed medications are taken appropriately. This leads to 125,000 lives lost unnecessarily and costs the healthcare system about $300 billion annually. Those facts blew me away, so I naturally started thinking about solutions. Having followed products like Fitbit from their pre-launch, I started to think about the potential impact of that kind of technology approach.\n\nAround that same time, I developed an allergy to my new puppy and started taking an allergy pill prescription. While I think of myself as a relatively competent person, I still found it difficult to develop a new routine around taking the pill.\n\nWith this work history experience and my own personal experience, I began reading about the “Nudge” and “Hooked” concepts in the newest behavioral science books. I became very interested in applying the work I did with the early wearables to medication adherence. The initial concept was creating a Fitbit-quality experience for people taking medications. By using similar design principles and the new (at the time) Bluetooth Low Energy technology, I knew there was potential to help people develop healthier habits that ultimately saved lives.\n\nI met Chuks through the startup community in Seattle. We started hanging out together and building some things, initially just for fun. I was taking a year off to focus on learning, including UX design and coding classes, so I made it a goal to create a Bluetooth-enabled medication adherence product. After some market research revealed enough consumer demand, we decided to go for it and Pillsy was born.\n\nYou shifted the focus of the company from Medication Adherence to RPM when CMS introduced reimbursement for RPM. But now, with RTM it looks like reimbursement for Medication Adherence could be in the foreseeable future. How could that impact Pillsy?\n\nI like to joke that we were about 5-7 years ahead of the market for Pillsy. In healthcare, sometimes it takes longer to get your product covered by payers even when there is legitimate demand and clear clinical benefit. In addition to navigating the bureaucracy of big payers, there are often other interests being protected that can slow down the process.\n\nBut eventually, healthcare can change for the better. And in this case, reimbursement for technology-enabled medication adherence will be huge.\n\nThinking about it another way, with all the changes that we’ve seen over the past 20 years, will the de-facto format for delivering medications still be plastic orange bottles in another 20 years? Let’s hope not. Orange bottles weren’t actually designed for patients. They were designed 40-50 years ago to streamline work for the pill-filling machines. And while they might save 45 cents of labor per fill, they are horrible to use, which contributes to the non-adherence problem.\n\nAt a certain point, the industry has to acknowledge how bad the existing medication delivery experience and ensuing outcomes are for the majority of people. It’s just a matter of time.\n\nIn the pharmaceutical world, drugs for chronic diseases are mostly commoditized generics. That means for 98% of the drugs dispensed, there is no differentiation on the actual drug being sold. However, there is plenty of room to differentiate on experience, or to go “beyond the pill” as many pharma people like to say. With technology, it’s possible to provide a digital coach that goes beyond the initial prescriber and the pharmacist to provide continuous 24/7 support. It could save tens of thousands of lives every year.\n\nYour LinkedIn tagline says you are “Building the Future of Continuous Remote Care”. What does that mean and how does it go beyond RPM?\n\nToday’s care is mostly episodic in nature, meaning that visits happen infrequently in the clinic. That has shifted to some degree post-COVID, but I think there is a realization that we have the technology to extend care beyond the four walls of a medical practice. Demand for these types of experiences is growing and they can provide superior clinical outcomes as well as improve overall quality of life for many patients.\n\nI’ve been known to say that remote patient monitoring is to remote care as books were to Amazon’s e-commerce business. It’s a great place to start, but it’s not necessarily the end game. I think people and practitioners want a single trusted partner to handle the bulk of their remote care interactions. It’s our goal to be that partner.\n\nOptimize Health recently hired a new CEO. What does Todd bring to the future of Optimize Health?\n\nHaving spent 10 years at athenahealth, Todd has amazing experience leading large teams and scaling digital health companies in our space. I’ve been successful as an innovator and an executor, but doing it at that scale like Todd is not something I’ve done. It’s a great combination.\n\nThe RPM field was really new when you started Optimize Health and it’s become an increasingly crowded field. How does Optimize Health stand out and how do you plan to stay ahead of the competition?\n\nThere’s a saying that if you don’t have any competition you should be worried. When we started out, I found that a big part of our initial job was educating people on the market itself. We used to have to prove that reimbursement was real by showing an Explanation of Benefits to practices. At this point, RPM is no longer a secret, especially with COVID dramatically accelerating the adoption of telehealth. More people are looking to provide these services and get reimbursed for them.\n\nWe are staying ahead by consistently improving and innovating. And, of course, we need to measure those improvements. In addition, we’ve developed a reputation for delivering on what we say we’ll deliver on. In this business, execution is the name of the game, and something that sounds too good to be true usually is.\n\nWe focus on executing and delivering value to our customers and patients. At the end of the day, we know our true mission is about improving patient care. That’s more important than beating our competitors, but putting patients and providers first will ultimately allow us to continue to outperform the other players.\n\nPersonally, I pick one thing that I want to improve on every day, week, and month. I write it down and I dedicate time to doing that, whether it’s through reading, coaching, or whatever. That goes for the individual Optimizers too; we encourage everybody to define and work on their own personal development goals.\n\nThe University of Michigan (Go Blue!) is well known for producing great entrepreneurs. Tell us a little more about your startup mentorship with TechArb at Michigan and why it’s important to you.\n\nGo Blue!\n\nPrior to attending Michigan, I had started websites around travel and live music venues that got some traction. But, I didn’t really know what to do when I started getting calls from other startups and VCs who wanted to partner with me. Michigan is where I learned how to think about a business more systematically, and how to do some specific things like read a term sheet and make a cap table.\n\nWe’ve collaborated with Michigan students in several ways, from hosting interns through the Zell Lurie program (especially helpful in a rapid phase of growth after COVID), to sponsoring projects through the School of Public Health and the Ross Business School. The Social Venture Fund, which was started by a couple of my friends when I was in school, has also invested in TechArb, as did a fellow entrepreneur from the Wolverine Venture Fund.\n\nThis is important to me because I saw the advantages that other students had coming out of schools in the Bay Area or Boston, where there is more local access to entrepreneurship and to VCs. Michigan has a large community of alumni entrepreneurs, but there is no single physical nexus where we all reside.\n\nEntrepreneurship has become a significant part of my self identity, so it’s important to me to give back. Through mentoring and coaching, I try to help the super talented Michigan students and alumni who want to build new things and have a positive impact on the world. And, it’s always been a lot of fun and incredibly rewarding to watch their ideas come to life."

The reason I make this distinction is that competition is usually not the way to optimize health, and I've heard that marathon-running is at a point where it's not maximally healthy.  If that's what most people are into here, that's fine and dandy, but that's not what I'm personally looking for.\n\nSo if my only goal is to be maximally healthy, how exactly should I be incorporating running?  How many times a week?  Is 3-4 consecutive days good (the other days I lift and want to conserve energy)?\n\nMale / Age 21\n\n## Comment ID em2p8mk with +18 score by [(malface7931, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em2p8mk/) (in reply to ID birz8u):\nFrom what I understand of cardio health, running approx. 5km at a decent pace at least 4 days a week would give you quite a good level of cardio health without stressing your body.

My routine is similar to what you mention, but I throw in a long run of at least 10 km once a week. This helps as a base for race season for me, so that I'll have a stronger base to start off training with. Races are great motivation, but I never aim to compete against anyone but myself--namely, my past self. (These last bits are anecdotal, of course.)\n\nHowever OP, I would not run 4 consecutive days. You need some rest days (or cross-training, too) in between runs. They say these rest days are when your body really works to build your strength. For example, I might run Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday.\n\n## Comment ID em31y9d with +23 score by [(tdammers, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em31y9d/) (in reply to ID birz8u):\nScience doesn't have a definitive answer for you here, but we do know a few things.\n\nFirst; \"more is more\", but not linearly so - that is, running twice as much does not produce twice the health benefits, rather maybe like 110-120% or so (I'm making this figure up, for illustrative purposes - main takeaway is that it's sublinear). Whether there is a maximum volume after which health benefits go down again is still a controversial question; some studies seem to support this hypothesis, but flaws have been pointed out in all of them so far.\n\nThen, a very important variable is training. 30 miles per week is \"maintenance\" for me, while for a brand new runner it'd be way above their abilities, and for an elite marathoner it would essentially be a week off. It's all relative, training above your level isn't sustainable, but as you adapt to training, your limit will shift, and what is a reasonable volume depends on that.\n\nGiven all this, there is no clear answer, because it depends on so many things. What can your body handle naturally? What's your running fitness like? What kind of injury / overtraining risk are you willing to accept? How hard are your workouts?\n\nThere is not anything fundamentally unhealthy about running marathons; problems arise when people *race* them, pushing their limits - as with any sport, doing that comes at a risk, and while the risks of running long distance may be different than those seen in other sports, the reason people get hurt has little to do with the distance per se. If you are trained for it and go at a pace that is well within your comfort zone, then even ultramarathon distances aren't really all that hardcore. I've done 10k races that were definitely harder on my body than some 30-40 mile runs I've done at a comfortable (as far as such a thing as \"comfort\" exists past mile 20) pace. Humans have run much longer distances than that throughout history; even the legenday Pheidippides, who inspired the Marathon as a discipline, didn't just run from Marathon to Athens (~25 miles) - he ran from Marathon to Sparta (some 120 miles) in one day, then back the next day, then participated in the battle, and THEN he'd run to Athens, where he collapsed from exhaustion (but probably survived - the dying part may be just poetic hyperbole). So not \"25 miles and then death\", but \"almost 300 miles and a battle, and he still made it\". And he was just doing his job; Greek armies employed professional runners who would routinely run upwards of 100 miles in a day as part of their jobs.\n\nSoooo... what do?\n\nBasically, if you want to run for health, and have your strength covered with lifting, then I'd recommend starting with some beginner program (couch to 5k, a.k.a. c25k, is good), and from there, gently work your way up to where you can comfortably run for an hour or so, at a leisurely pace, a couple times per week (putting you in the 3-5 hours per week range). It seems that this is approximately where the cost / benefit ration of maintaining the required training volume starts shelving off - you still get upwards of 90% of the health benefits, and if trained properly, a very very small risk of serious damage or injury. \"Every other day\" seems like a decent balance to me - for a beginner, more days may be too taxing, and later it may not be worth pushing for more, especially if you also do other exercise.\n\n\"Conserving energy\" is not a concern btw; lifting doesn't burn that much, and taps into different energy sources (slow running is mainly fat and some glycogen, but you need to keep going for about 3 hours or so to make a serious dent in your glyco stores), while lifting mainly runs on ATP, and gets refilled from available carbs (but you can never possibly lift enough to deplete the glyco stores). So if you \"run out of energy\", what really happens is that your muscles aren't recovered yet. But if you run at a truly slow pace, and lift heavy (hi-res, lo-rep), then you will almost exclusively recruit slow-twitch fibres for running, and fast-twitch for lifting. OTOH, if you run too fast, running will use fast-twitch too, and the result is slow progress on the running front, and jelly legs when lifting after running.\n\n### Comment ID em34zlw with +5 score by [(OracleOfOntario, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em34zlw/) (in reply to ID em31y9d):\nwow, great post, that's some sage advice.\n\n## Comment ID em2okkw with +10 score by [(ithinkitsbeertime, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em2okkw/) (in reply to ID birz8u):\nThe CDC says:\n\n>For substantial health benefts, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) to 300 minutes (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes) to 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity.  \n>  \n>Preferably, aerobic activity should be spread throughout the week. Additional health benefts are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond the equivalent of 300 minutes (5 hours) of moderate-intensity physical activity a week.\n\nThey define 'moderate' and 'vigorous' in terms of METs but jogging / running probably meets the thresholds for vigorous unless you're walking big parts of it. So 3-4 days of 30-45 minutes would certainly get you there. Lifting of course also counts. I don't think I'd schedule my days consecutively though, I'd probably alternate running and lifting.\n\n### Comment ID em2ouwt with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em2ouwt/) (in reply to ID em2okkw):\nAlright, this sounds good.\n\n### Comment ID em7vtue with +1 score by [(myprivatethroway, Reddit, 2019-05-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em7vtue/) (in reply to ID em2okkw):\nWhat does *at least \"range\"*  mean?\n\n  \n\n\nAt least 150 minutes of work is a lot less than at least 300 minutes of work\n\n## Comment ID em2q2ba with +9 score by [(OracleOfOntario, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em2q2ba/) (in reply to ID birz8u):\nI too run for health, but the competition aspect makes it way more fun if you plan on running over many years.

I wouldn't start off with 3-4 consecutive days though; I think working towards that is fine, but your body will need time to adjust.  I suggest doing couch to 5K, or another 5K plan if you feel you're a little more advanced (like [hal higdon's novice 5K] (https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/5k-training/novice-5k/)).  Even if you don't want to run a 5K race at the end of the plan, using a plan anyway is easy to follow and is meant to prepare your body properly.  \n\nPersonally, I don't run races often, and if I do it's only for fun with friends.  I run about a 5K each run about 3 times per week, and I think it's a good distance for general health.

The border between Z1 and Z2 representing the first lactate turnpoint \\~ 2mmol. The border between Z2 and Z3 representing the second turnpoint \\~ 4mmol.In this model, Zone 2 would be similar to a Zone 3 (on a Five Zone scale) - correlating with somewhere around 80-85% of Max HR.\n\nIn any case, I don't know if I have misinterpreted the question, but it seems many replies have read the question differently than I.\n\nThe subject is asking if \"cardio is necessary\", but the main body implies if high intensity cardio is necessary, or if his long walks are adequate.\n\nI'm still new to this subject as a whole but I've immersed myself in it over the past six months, digesting hours of content from Peter Attia, Mike Joyner, Andy Gaupin, Huberman, Stephen Seiler, etc. Stephen in particular has a lot of specialised content on youtube focusing on this, and \"how low is too low\" intensity wise.\n\nI'd direct you to this chart ([https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/coggan-s-physiological-adaptation-chart/75468](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/coggan-s-physiological-adaptation-chart/75468)) which shows the different adaptations (or lack thereof) that happen during cardio at different intensity.\n\nReally, if your goal is to improve VO2 max -- long walks are not adequate. That doesn't mean you wont enjoy those walks and still burn calories - but it won't do wonders for VO2max. That chart will loosely illustrate the amount of Vo2 max improvements you'll get from each intensity level - as well as a plethora of other adaptations that occur. It's quite informative. (I focus on Vo2 max purely as that's typically touted as one of the best predictors of longevity as a whole, but there are tons of other benefits from high intensity cardio).\n\nA simple cardio workout routine (which has worked for me, improving my 5K time from over 30 minutes to less than 19 minutes across a four month time span) has been:\n\n3 x \"Zone 2\" runs (based on the 5-HR Zones) for 45-75 minutes per run (dependent on how much time I have - more the better)  \nand  \n1 x \"Vo2 max protocol\" - my preference is 1km repeats (running at 95% effort for 1km) with a 1:1 rest recovery ratio. Repeat this 5-6 times, with 1.5km warm up.  \n\n\nIf I get time for another run, I'll typically throw in a Tempo or Threshold Run (eg. running for 5-10K at 90% of max HR).\n\nThat improved my Vo2 max from 35 (estimate) to 55 (estimate) across those same four months.

While there are overlapping benefits between the two, cardiorespiratory exercises have a stronger beneficial impact on vascular health by improving the amount of nitric oxide present, blood vessel responsiveness to nitric oxide, and thus, a lower resting blood pressure. Beyond that, there is evidence to suggest that endothelial integrity is improved with a lower likelihood of lipoprotein penetration into the endothelium. Separately, there is also evidence that running stabilizes pre-existing atherosclerotic plaque and also reduces plaque volume / size. Angiogenesis is another benefit, where additional blood vessel growth occurs, while also dilating and enlarging existing blood vessels. There is evidence that endurance training reduces risk of sudden cardiac death from arrhythmia. Endurance training has a more significant impact on cardiac function, such as stroke volume, as well as VO2 max. It is my understanding that VO2 max is the strongest predictor of longevity, more so than insulin resistance, hypertension, obesity, etc.  Both weight resistance training and endurance training improve glucose and lipid metabolism. \n\n[Exercise benefits in cardiovascular diseases: from mechanisms to clinical implementation. Pedro L. Valenzuela.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37005351/)\n\nTo answer your question specifically, if you’re lifting hard enough at a high degree of effort and intensity, you will probably derive some of the above benefits. I do believe you would obtain additional benefit by incorporating some endurance training. Hopping on the stairclimber at the gym may be a practical way to build lower strength while incorporating endurance training.\n\n### Comment ID k95ka8m with +1 score by [(toothmanhelpting, Reddit, 2023-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k95ka8m/) (in reply to ID k92m2md):\nTo sum it up….

There is a 50% improvement in mortality between the worst quartile and the second worst quartile. Worst to above average is 60-70% reduction in 10 year mortality. There is no drug that compares, not by a long shot. The only way to get improved cardiorespiratory fitness is with aerobic exercise. And it doesn't take much to go from worst to second worst. It does take a lot of volume exercising to make it to the top 5 percentile but there continues to be a mortality benefit. \n\nResistance training is beneficial too.\n\n## Comment ID k93hb78 with +7 score by [(andonemoreagain, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k93hb78/) (in reply to ID 17ub1wx):\nRhonda Patrick had a recent podcast with a scientist in the field about the specific benefits of hard cardio.

Overall this is worth thinking on, though Milo is talking about 6 days/week of lifting plus a lot of steps, not OPs 3 days.\n\nMy critiques of the Wolf approach are (i) a sufficiently powered subgroup analysis is probably needed to even consider a concentrated approach like that (ii) Wolf doesn't seem to appreciate a basic point about risk management-- i.e. a more diversified approach tends to pay off quite well for long term investments in a very uncertain environment (iii) Attia emphasizes performance metrics  like VO2 max which Wolf criticizes as having a major genetic component  so he wants to look at hours of effort instead... but completely ignoring performance is a bit ironic as Wolf is a strength coach so surely he appreciates the fact that *well designed and executed* lifting programs are not remotely comparable in results to that of the typical gym goer even when hours are equated... and the idea that training quality doesn't impact healthspan strikes me a as quite leap.\n\n### Comment ID k941wwe with +5 score by [(AndeyR, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k941wwe/) (in reply to ID k93hcyy):\nI feel like Peter gamifies VO2max too much, its a proxy, and chances are, training specifically for this number would not do much (or would not be as effective as someone doing sports and getting to this number as a byproduct)\n\nNext step would be to train grip strength )\n\n#### Comment ID k946hc4 with +2 score by [(NotSaucerman, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k946hc4/) (in reply to ID k941wwe):\nYea, I anticipate Peter to deprecate VO2 max over time in favor of a basket of cardio  indicators once more data becomes available.

Doing things that improve your heart health is probably a good way to improve health span.\n\nI think the reason people don't like cardio is because they buy into the \"no pain, no gain\" mentality.\n\nFor example, embracing long duration zone 2 isn't really that \"intensive\". I think it can actually be boring...so I tend to do it on an indoor bike while playing video games.\n\nI don't do the high intensity intervals as described by Attia. Instead, I've been doing clean and jerks with double kettlebells 3 days a week (modified version of Geoff Neupert's Long Cycle of Death program). About 100 reps spread over 30 minutes in various rep schemes. Lots of time in Zone 5, but with work periods on the order of 15-30 seconds (depending on rep scheme) and similar rest periods. But each workout has 30-40 sets depending on the rep scheme.\n\nSo not the prescription Peter gives, but my guess is that it's fine provided I'm not trying to be an elite cyclist. And it's way easier on my knees than sprinting. Seems to me like a great combination of strength and cardio. It's the only workout where I really get that \"runner's high\".

No one knows when your first lactate turnpoint occurs (it's individual). This is technically when you cross over from Zone 2 to Zone 3. This is typically correlated with 65-80% of max HR - but everyone's will actually be different. But if you reach that range with brisk walking, then yes - Zone 2 can be achieved.\n\nHowever as you get fitter, you will notice you can now maintain the same pace as before, but at a much lower heart rate - meaning you will have to increase the intensity to stay in that zone. Whether this is simply ramping up the incline %, or if you need to up the pace to a slow jog.\n\nMost people will sustain Zone 2 with a slow jog - you definitely do not have to \"run\" to stay in Zone 2 (subjective - if you're fit enough to run fast relative to others in Zone 2, you probably still don't perceive that run as a fast run, since you'd be capable of running even faster I guess!).\n\nFor me, when I first started cardio six months ago. Here's some stats for comparison:\n\nApril 19th, 2023. \"Zone 2 run\" (My Max HR is 199. Zone 2 for me is estimated at 128-160)4KM was at Zone 2 (about 30 mins) and the last 1KM was at a faster pace.\n\n1KM, 6:34, 154 HR1KM, 7:07, 160 HR1KM, 7:30, 154 HR1KM, 6:35, 154 HR1KM, 5:39, 167 HR\n\nSo that average pace of around 6:30 minutes per KM, kept me in Zone 2.\n\nHowever fast forward six months, I now need to run at around 5:00-5:15 per KM to stay in the same HR zone. Back when I started, 1 KM at 5:00 was the same time as my max 1km effort! Now I can sustain this for 15+km IN \"zone 2\" heart rate range...\n\nTL;DR - You could sustain a Zone 2 workout with brisk walks, but as your fitness improves, walking pace may no longer be sufficient.\n\nStephen Seiler has an interesting youtube video on low intensity, and \"How low is too low\" eg. Zone 1 vs Zone 2. Would recommend a lot of his content too!\n\n## Comment ID l92ehfi with +1 score by [(gettotea, Reddit, 2024-06-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/l92ehfi/) (in reply to ID 17ub1wx):\nBookmark\n\n## Comment ID lvvsfev with +1 score by [(ThatFaithlessness545, Reddit, 2024-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/lvvsfev/) (in reply to ID 17ub1wx):\n100% without a doubt, look at the most healthy fittest aged population amd what they do.\n they are soo fit and healthy still at their age because they do regular cardio not just weights.\n\n\nYou look at people who only lifted weights for most of their lives and they are either very imobile from not moving their body, they have heart issues and are overweight because all the muscle has gone and they put on alot of fat or they're dead if they were taking drugs or just eating too much all the time trying to bulk up, \n\n\nThat puts alot of pressure on your heart amd other organs while cardio gets your blood circulating, joints lubricated, keeps your brain sharp, flushes your system, improves digestion, burns alot of calories, etc. All of which weight lifting only does a fraction of if any\n\n\nDo both in balance,\n\n\nMuscle growth is cool and all but not at the expense of your overall health and well-being especially into later years\n\n## Comment ID k92v3mv with +1 score by [(medhat20005, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k92v3mv/) (in reply to ID 17ub1wx):\nIf the goal is to \"optimize health and longevity,\" I would guess (really, it's all somewhat educated guessing anyways) that more, but not too much more, than long slow walks would derive most of the benefits of a more structured zone 2 workout several times a week.

All else tends to be quackery, stuff for workaholics who have been lied to about a shortcut to success.\n\n### Comment ID jypkf6k with +6 score by [(money_mase19, Reddit, 2023-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sauna/comments/16790tw/optimal_use_for_healthwellbeing/jypkf6k/) (in reply to ID jyoceg0):\nI like how this was phrased\n\n#### Comment ID jypz7t2 with +6 score by [(TerryFGM, Reddit, 2023-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sauna/comments/16790tw/optimal_use_for_healthwellbeing/jypz7t2/) (in reply to ID jypkf6k):\nJohn_sux might seem prickly but he usually has a good take on stuff\n\n### Comment ID jyppw7t with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sauna/comments/16790tw/optimal_use_for_healthwellbeing/jyppw7t/) (in reply to ID jyoceg0):\nvery good comment!\n\nMy advice is that you try make sauna a part of your normal routine. The sauna itself does not work miracles, even if the Finns say so.\n\nSauna is like meditation, going to sauna and having those \"healing\" benefits (mental) requires the right state of mind, practice and peace of mind.\n\nIf you are clinically anxious or depressed, you may not have enough peace of mind to have fully relaxing sauna experience, but still it might help little.\n\nThe shock of a sauna and cold water or snow, can take a depressed person away from that horrible feeling of anxiety for a while, but unfortunately it doesn't fix anything in long run. Sauna can help recovery from mental challenges if there are other means involved, such as therapy, exercise, diet and possibly medication. Sauna is meditation.\n\n#### Comment ID jysappb with +5 score by [(DefinitelyNotSully, Reddit, 2023-09-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sauna/comments/16790tw/optimal_use_for_healthwellbeing/jysappb/) (in reply to ID jyppw7t):\n> The sauna itself does not work miracles, even if the Finns say so.\n\nWe don't say so.

You need muscle mass. It's so hard to put on as a woman (after newbie gains, it's a few solid pounds a year), and muscle loss is a HUGE contributor to loss of quality of life. Not to mention accidents, metabolism decline, and loss in bone density. You can have great arteries and heart, but if you lose your balance and fall, or can't lift 25lb over your head when you're 60, your quality of life will diminish.\n\nThat's just the extreme end of the spectrum. As you get into your 30s, 40s, and 50s, you need your back to be in good working condition. That's glute strength, core strength. It's strength keeping your back supported. All the flexibility or cardio in the world won't keep your back healthy. And once your back goes... kiss all your other activities goodbye. \n\nYou don't need to lift WEIGHTS per se, but you need muscle-building, strength exercise. \n\nThere are plenty of great things highlighted above but that's just what I'm hitting.

I'm terrified of getting old and being/feeling helpless because I didn't focus on functional fitness when I was relatively young. I'm going to lift as long as I possibly can. I watched my grandmother go from 100% active in her late 80's to bedbound because of a bad hip in her early to mid-90's and I'm not doing that to myself. My family members have the tendency to live past 100, I'm not taking any chances. \n\nI've always exercised but it's been off and on due to chronic illness. I've gotten my pain and other symptoms largely under control this year, started losing weight due to Wegovy, and laser focused in on lifting, nutrition, and improving my overall fitness. I have a bad hip and I've gotten my function up to a point where it only occasionally aches.

This bears out with what I've witnessed in the older women in my life. The ones who are able to do daily planks and squats are in general more mobile, and those who can't lift themselves out of a chair are...obviously not. So I try to do body weight exercises every day, if I'm not just heaving myself around as a matter of course. Having a garden is great for that. In the spring and summer I spend at least an hour a day bending, lifting and squatting. I would imagine running around after small children achieves the same effect :)\n\n## Comment ID jltr8hz with +81 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltr8hz/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nFind something you enjoy.

As women age hormonal changes make us lose muscle easily and it’s harder to put back on. Over time this has an effect on our hormonal balance, our bone density and it also is a main cause of the slowing of our metabolism. A lot of women get overly focused on cardio for weight loss, but running really messes you up over time, it wears out all of your joints. Cardiovascular health *is* important but maintaining muscle mass is imperative. If you want cardio, focus on something low impact that also builds strength (swimming is the best in my opinion. Bike riding and hiking are good too.) get out in nature, it positively effects your blood pressure and stress levels, which in turn will keep your weight down and your heart healthy (stress has a lot of systemic consequences including weight gain). \n\nNutrition: throw out diet culture. Eat balanced, regular meals. Balanced means a protein a fat a carb and a fruit/vegetable. That is a meal. Try to eat at least three of those a day, more if you are still hungry. Emphasize protein to keep your muscle up. If you want dessert, eat it. Let go of food rules and focus on nourishment instead of deprivation. \n\nBest long term exercise for supporting these goals in my opinion: swimming, bike riding, yoga (unless you are hyper-mobile) pilates, weight lifting, dance (GREAT for your long term cognitive health), aerial acrobatics (I do pole dancing, HELLO upper body and core strength!), WALKING IS SO UNDERRATED, hiking, cross country skiing, snow shoeing I’m sure I can come up with more but really, find something relatively low impact that you genuinely enjoy doing, that’s the key. Consistency will win out against perfection every day of the week. It’s about building small habits and stacking them up over time.\n\n## Comment ID jlts7mb with +54 score by [(OnehappyOwl44, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlts7mb/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI have never restricted my diet in anyway.

There are no tricks to it. When I have the opportunity, I make sure to get movement in whether it’s walking or lifting weights. I don’t restrict my eating (but also am mindful of calories taken in…I just am not counting calories) and try to focus on getting healthy fats, protein, and carbs each day.

I’m currently pregnant for the first time and my body has definitely changed a lot through the process so far (which has been tough to be honest) but I still follow the same principles (as much as I can - which is definitely less than before pregnancy) but I plan to adhere to the same approach post-partum.  \n\nBiggest thing I can say is that WE are in charge of our health and can absolutely maintain and even optimize health and fitness in our 30s and beyond.

Love. It. And I definitely go through phases where I will eat more of it and of lesser quality than I should allow. \n\nBut I get back on track to healthy eating after a couple of weeks because that is what my body is used to, and I feel better doing it. My food habits include eating boiled eggs, roast chicken, baked fish, good quality canned tuna, lots of salad, sautéed spinach and other veg, low glycemic index fruit like blueberries, and some almonds. Whole wheat pasta, some lentils, too. I wash and cut up veg like broccoli and store it in a paper towel lined Pyrex dish in the fridge so it's grab and go. I'll bake a batch of chicken breast or thighs (skin off) and freeze on wax paper so it's easy to heat up when I need it. \n\nI walk a lot. I try to do 3.5 miles 3 to 5 times a week. I need to be lifting weights, and yoga makes me feel great when I do it. I like Bree and Flo short yoga classes (15-30 minutes) on YouTube. \n\nIMO, if habits are broken in then you're on autopilot and your body will gravitate to what it \"thinks\" it should be doing. This is for good and bad habits, so I reinforce the good habits.\n\n## Comment ID jltoufe with +23 score by [(Explodingovary, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltoufe/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI just do portion control and trying to make healthier choices 70-80% of the time.

You don't need to go fully vegan/plant-based to have a solid diet and healthy weight, but it was something that became easy for me pretty quickly, and then it stuck for a variety of reasons. You can do a vegan diet and be unhealthy, true, but in general, it supports good health. Whatever works for you, get your diet sorted out to something you can sustain. \"Eat food, mostly plants, not too much\" is good advice and a good target. \n\nThen just keep moving. I rotate through hobbies and could never stick with a gym membership, but I just keep finding something to do. For some seasons of my life, that was climbing and yoga. In others, skiing and mountain biking. Another, road biking and weight lifting. Currently, hiking and paddle boarding/kayaking. Even just a solid hour-long evening walk or living room YT yoga session will serve you well. Strength training is important as you age too, but if it's between long evening walks and nothing, then go get that cardio in.\n\nSeparate from going vegan, I had to quit drinking when I realized it was a migraine trigger. I don't think being 100% sober forever is the only way to be healthy, but if you're in the habit of drinking regularly, it's probably a good idea to set it down and fix the 'habit' part. Alcohol really is poison (delicious poison, but poison nonetheless), and there are plenty of ways to supplant whatever health benefits they're trying to sell for it (antioxidants, etc). \n\nWhat motivates me is watching older people who pay little to no attention to their health act like health and mobility are completely out of our control and then endlessly complain as their health declines (kind of like the people who say things like \"you can't plan or really ever be 'ready' for kids lololol\" as if birth control and financial planning are things that do not exist). I also live in a place where you do see a lot of older people out hiking and biking - it's definitely possible to enjoy an active life in your later years, but it doesn't happen by accident. Not even *trying* to stay active and healthy is a sure ticket to pain and lower quality of life, so just keep getting back on the horse, no matter where you fell off. \n\nYou don't really get to choose your health problems, but you can choose how well you take care of yourself in spite of whatever challenges you face. Lots of people would hear \"vegan and no alcohol\" and assume it's no fun and a constant bummer, but it's really nice feeling healthy and not being hungover like, ever. And I'm a good cook, so being vegan doesn't rob me anything on that side of things. My quality of life is higher because of it, not lower.\n\n### Comment ID jlu5t5o with +3 score by [(plutonianbitch, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlu5t5o/) (in reply to ID jlts6qh):\nYes to all of this 💗\n\n## Comment ID jltqns2 with +118 score by [(freshie4o9, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltqns2/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nGenetics.

I started developing at 12 and pretty soon had the broad shoulders, gigantic boobs, wide rib cage, and round belly I've carried around my whole life.

I've been fighting my genes for decades and it's so frustrating because a lot of people refuse to accept that it's just a lot harder for some of us. I've never ever been effortlessly slender. Heck even when I was 135LB I didn't look slender. I'm not built for slenderness.

Find what makes you feel happy and works do you. You cannot do it all at once, perfectly 100% of the the time. Be gentle with yourself. Don’t compare yourself to others. Don’t deprive yourself of foods you love, but think of adding in more healthy foods. I love fried chicken, but if I’m going to have it, I’ll have a salad or vegetable on the side. Try to move every day, but not every workout needs to be intense. Walking on off days can be a very good friend, and it gets you outside where you can calm your mind and focus on your surroundings. Sleep. Cutting back on alcohol has also worked really well for me. It’s all about incremental progress and sustainable habits. I’m feeling more motivated and stronger now at 36 than I did at 26. Looking forward to what my 40s can bring.\n\nEdit: Adding that it is hard to outwork a bad diet/high caloric intake with exercise.

Running.  I was lucky that this has been my exercise of choice, because it’s so much easier to motivate for and fit into a busy schedule and holes in the day than things that require going to a gym, wearing special clothes and equipment, meeting up with a partner or team.  You can really just put on your shoes and go. In a pinch, I’ve run in jeans and dresses. It’s available 24/7, from 30-95 degrees with proper adaptations (some people run much colder than this but I’m a cold weather wimp).  I keep a gym bag in my car and run during my kids’ activities.  I also have a big dog and run confidently with her after dark. \n2.  Having kids and keeping up with them.  When you go to the playground, don’t just sit and watch and catch up on your phone.

For me it's triathlons. For someone else, it's barre class or yoga. Whatever keeps your body moving will 100% benefit you in the long run.\n\n\nStart incorporating weight lifting into your routine. You will NOT get bulky. You will build skeletol muscle that will help your body maintain its mobility and bone density as you age.\n\n\nSomeone else mentioned mobility. Keep up your stretching. Take care of your injuries. Do your physical therapy. Not only will these help you heal up faster if you do get injured, but they will help prevent further injury in the first place.\n\n\nAs for nutrition: 80/20. I eat healthy 80% of the time. The other 20% for me means pizza and a beer every single Friday, and 2 Dove chocolates after lunch and dinner. Do I have some unfortunate body fat? Yes. Is it biologically necessary for me as a woman to have body fat in the areas it's in? Also, yes.\n\n\nJust remember to keep thinking big picture. Everything you do for yourself today, think of yourself at 90. You're doing this for you 90s body.\n\n## Comment ID jlvwkbd with +5 score by [(awakened97, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlvwkbd/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nIt’s important to understand that the body changing with age isn’t simply solely because of age. It’s just that around 30, you begin to visibly see the ramifications of your lifestyle. Depending on your lifestyle—the rate of the body aging, weight gain, cognitive decline, all of it is significantly impacted. This should hopefully be empowering because it means we have more control over our personal health and fitness with age than is let on in the states.\n\nI first focused on my blood sugar regulation, as blood sugar spikes can cause gradual metabolic damage, inflammation and thus aging, and slowing the metabolism over time. This results in that stubborn fat that won’t move. Living a sedentary life (like sitting at a desk all day then sitting on the couch all night) also slows our metabolism, and this lowers our energy and efficiency with burning fat.\n\nHere in the states we’re led to believe caring about the blood sugar is only for people worried about diabetes.\n\nAll of this to say—regular walks, leading my meals with protein & fiber before my sweet treats (to prevent blood sugar spikes without restricting), eating fresh raw fruits& veggies when possible, and 3x/week cardio made a HUGE difference in my life.\n\n## Comment ID jltlhl2 with +12 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltlhl2/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nUhh...

Even when I travel I try to pack snacks instead of eating at the airport or on the road. 95% of the food I cook doesn’t come out of a box. I’m not cooking full, organic, fresh meals that have been kissed by the sun god or anything. Just pasta with carrots or fajitas or whatever. \nWhen I want a cookie, I eat a cookie. But I actively buy foods without added sugar. I also don’t eat if I’m not hungry and don’t feel bad if I overeat due to hormones. Which means the days before my period I’ll eat anything not still breathing. The days after, I could live off a yogurt and a handful of cashews. Also, I drink water with lemon and black coffee and never soda or sugary drinks. (And booze because of course)\n\nAs for working out, I work out so I can do the things I enjoy when I can actually do them. I love to hike and backpack, so I need to stay in shape year round so that when the time comes, I’m not struggling. I actually enjoy manual labor like working in the yard and shoveling snow so I lean into those when I can (who wants to move garden rocks with me this weekend!). I also walk whenever I can. Like, actually walk to the store or the bar or my friends houses if I can make it in a reasonable amount of time. When I worked in an office I always too the stairs, even when I worked on the 20th floor. \nI care more about my health than my looks. When I worked in an office I’d go to the gym for lunch and do a quick washcloth bath afterwards, never a full shower. I kept my hair simple and my makeup light because my lunch hour was too short to get in a good work out AND look pretty afterwards. \n\nI don’t workout as much as I did when I was younger but my goals have changed so that’s ok. But I just turned 40 and I can still do a couple of pushups and jog a mile without really trying.\n\n## Comment ID jltw23p with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltw23p/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nChoose activities you actually enjoy and would look forward to doing.

You must learn to be disciplined because you will not always be motivated. Consistency doesn’t mean perfection, but that you get it right most of the time. \n\nWeight training is important for women as we age because it, along with other factors helps prevent osteoporosis and other age-related issues. It will help you recover faster from injuries as well as help prevent them - of course as long as you use proper form and don’t lift too heavy of weights before you have built the strength to do so. \n\n Genetics plays a big role in how you age and what your body looks like, however eating a healthy diet of lean protein, veggies, carbs, and fats will give whatever genetics you have a boost. I know I will never have skinny legs, it’s just not in my genetics. If fat bottom girls make the rockin’ world go ‘round, my family is doing their part. I try not to beat myself up about it, which I will admit is sometimes really hard.  \n\nI cycle through periods of calorie restriction (fat loss) and maintenance, where I get to enjoy foods I love that aren’t healthy (but are good for the soul) - you can’t and shouldn’t live your life on a “diet” or in a state of calorie restriction for many reasons (quality of life, metabolic adaptation, etc.)  \n\nI leave room in my life for the good-for-the-soul foods most of the year, and restrict my calories for a short time when I feel I need to. I have been generally  able to keep visible abs year round without killing myself (again see my comment about genetics! And that wasn’t always the case!) I found an diet and exercise program that works for me (Renaissance Periodization). I lift weights and do some amount of cardio 5-6 days per week. I genuinely love lifting, I love how it has transformed my body and I love how strong I am. Lifting gives me a sense of accomplishment and makes me feel powerful. But I also know that not everyone loves lifting and that is totally ok.

So making sure you eat the right quantity for you in some form is key, whether that's keto, intermittent fasting, or just having a handle on your overall intake. Other than that,  focusing on building muscle through strength training also helps metabolism (and motivation because you'll feel strong). Protein intake helps build muscle so that's important too. And staying active with walking or other activity outside the gym.\n\nFor me the biggest motivator is finding a way to strength train that always has me chasing a little more - a new skill, a new PR, or even just moving the same weight but better. I work with a coach right now who programs for me in a way I like but there are tons of good online programs too.

It's absolutely not. I was a chubby child through my early teens. It took a concerted effort for me to lose weight in high school, which I did by walking and jogging a lot. It takes discipline and consistency for me to not regain weight.\n\nThe physique I have now is due to a combination of intense workouts and a great diet, but it' mostly my diet. I'm able to maintain my lean frame (just not my biceps) through just walking a lot (I have dogs) and eating intentionally.\n\nI intermittent fast (loosely) and do cardio at 6am on an empty stomach. I eat a green smoothie for lunch practically every day of my life unless I'm traveling. Then, I limit snacking in between meals. I'll have a *planned* snack or two in between lunch and dinner but I never graze. Dinner is a salad with lean protein several days per week, some type of burger (turkey/salmon/impossible, rarely beef) with salad or roasted veggies once or twice, then pasta or pizza with salad/roasted veggies the other days. This is the carb/calorie cycling method where I eat at maintenance or slightly under it based on my TDEE (google it) and then spike my carbs and calories a few days a week to refuel and stabilize hunger hormones, facilitate muscle growth and repair.\n\nYou have to care about and enjoy this stuff, however. I like being active, I find healthy food delicious, and I also like to eat huge portions, so intermittent fasting lets me do this without gaining weight. There's something to be said for finding what works for you, but as another commenter said, knowing your energy needs (i.e. how many calories and what nutrients your body requires to function) and meeting these, plus being physically active go a long way to keeping a person fit as they age. You just have to make it a priority which many people cannot or won't do, especially women. This goes double for moms, so it's worthwhile for me to acknowledge that I don't have kids and my body has never undergone pregnancy or childbirth.\n\n## Comment ID jluhpu0 with +2 score by [(Eva_De_Peva, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jluhpu0/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nFor me it has been playing capoeira, taking daily 30 minute lunch walks, and bikepacking.

It's been more than a decade of this one ritual I love that keeps me flexible and aligned. Other fitness routines have come and gone but having this one staple has had an incredible impact on my overall mental and physical health. \n\nI think that finding one small thing you get joy from and being *consistent* with it is important. Whether that's yoga, rebounding, walking, lifting etc. you will have a baseline no matter what. \n\nAnd then eliminating foods that don't serve you for more healthful whole options. Lots of fresh fruits and veggies-- remember muscles are built from glucose not protein. Less fats burdening your liver which starts to slow down now (leads to sluggishnness, weight gain and things we see as \"aging\").\n\nAnd lastly good sleep and good hydration!\n\n## Comment ID jlunudt with +2 score by [(HellGoddessHG, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlunudt/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI had twins and weighed 250.

I can’t eat in the morning so my first meal is lunch. I’m also not a snacker so generally that’s it food wise. I’m also conscious of eating nutritious food and incorporate vegetables and fruit as much as I can every day.

The goal is to naturally transition into a whole foods way of eating such that it isn't a \"diet\". \n\nWalk 10,000+ steps a day most days. A 45 minute to one hour walk is about 10,000 steps for me. \n\nStay active throughout the day. Set a timer on your phone to walk around the office, do squats and calf lifts, or whatever you can and feel comfortable doing every half hour to an hour. Do NOT sit in a chair for 4+ hours straight. \n\nTake up some active hobbies that you can do after work and/or on weekends. Bouldering, cycling, hiking, running etc have relatively low barriers to entry and are more fun (to me) than the gym. When I started getting active, I just did a few body weight workout videos that I liked on YouTube on most days.

I like to learn \"comfort meals\" from all the different types of cuisines and make them at home with lots of love and high quality ingredients. \n\nI am motivated primarily by the fact that my entire family are all extremely unhealthy and succumb to illnesses, passing way too young. My cousin cannot walk because she's done damage to her back and can't do the physio to recover. My uncle died this year from stage 4 liver cancer, which I think is probably due to crash dieting and never addressing binge eating patterns. \n\nI also find being active is good for my mental health, and I do stuff I find fun like mountain biking, sword fighting and other types of \"stunt\" work.

I do both Orangetheory (it’s my social time after working from home) and walks/runs (I love being outside). My dog is 15 and she still goes on walks every day and looks half her age and still gets puppy energy. I hope my body feels younger as I age just by moving it. \n\nFor nutrition, it’s also remembering how crappy I feel when I consistently don’t eat well. I’m a big believer in being able to eat what you want as long as you don’t eat too large of portions and having a variety of food. That’s when I feel my best. I’m an over eater by nature so I go through waves of it but I go crazy if I put huge limitations on myself. And weighing/measuring my food stresses me out. This works for a lot of people but not me. So again, finding what works for you. \n\nWhat motivates me is remembering how tired and lazy I felt before starting OT and I don’t want to feel that way again. Starting my day with a walk energizes me for the day and doing OT after work gives me an outlet for my stress. And start small. No need to make yourself start working out five days a week. Start with one walk in a day and you’ll be amazed at how much more you want to move your body.\n\n## Comment ID jltzvtc with +1 score by [(ozzleworth, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jltzvtc/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI do things, get fed up or reach a good level, get bored and try something else!

The best approach is what you can do and what you can sustain over the long term. I do not recommend any fad diets at all. I also do not recommend anything that's super restrictive or requires you spend money on plans, specific food, supplements, etc. \n\nThe reason why it needs to be sustainable is because investing in your health and fitness now and making it a lifelong habitat will benefit you for your entire life, and you'll really see that happens when you're in your 50s. That's when your habits start to catch up to you and the impact of your lifestyle really makes itself felt.\n\nFor cred: I'm 43 and while I no longer run marathons or do triathlons, I still hike, mountain bike, do yoga and lift weights.

I am mostly fit. I pretty much think it was being really athletic as a kid, taking dance classes, (still occasionally do), horseback riding (I still do that every week), sports and being outside running around all of the time. Just all around staying physically active. I have goats and chickens, so I regularly jump over fences, haul hay and 50lb sacks of feed around. When I walk, I walk fast. I stretch to keep my joints limber.\n\nAs for diet, I eat whatever I feel like eating whenever I feel like it, but compared to my friends, I seem to eat a lot less than they do...... but then, I also weigh a lot less. Interestingly, they all think they eat way less than I see that they actually do eat. I eat full fat, and sugar. No caffeine, not much alcohol. I never eat food with the words, \"low fat\", \"fat free\", \"diet\" or \"keto\" on them. I do eat fresh food that I make from scratch, and almost nothing processed. Never have. Fast food? Pretty much never. Breakfast is a no. I eat one large meal a day and snack on fruit or whatever....I graze. Big meal always has veg and whatever else I feel like.\n\nI am around 8lbs heavier than I'd like to be, (right now I am 5'2\" and 112lbs on a very small frame), but I'm too lazy to diet. You lose muscle as you get older and gain a tummy pretty much no matter how fit you are, but you also get more complacent about how you look as long as you feel good and are mostly healthy.\n\n## Comment ID jlu9t5s with +1 score by [(ZedZemM, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlu9t5s/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI gained some weight that stick since I turned 30.

Find your favorite way to move/exercise and do it multiple times a week. Same with food - find a handful of your favorite healthy dishes that hit your macros and stick with them.

Add more changes as your habits stick.\n\nAs far as exercise…find things you enjoy. I stay active in many ways. I’ve tried HIIT, yoga, cardio, weights etc etc…what works best for me is the ones I enjoy the most. That being said…I’ve found weights (even just 10-20 pound weighted exercises) are most beneficial to keeping myself pain free. Took me awhile to figure that out but it really is worth it to add a few weighted programs a week.

Lol I jest but I really think one of the main reasons I've been able to stay fit and not put on a lot of weight is I don't have kids. I haven't had to go through the physical rollercoaster of pregnancy and childbirth and have limited free time because I was caring for my children. Not saying you can't stay fit as a parent: it's just harder for a lot of people because you have a lot less free time and energy. \n\nNow on a more serious note \n\n1) lots of cooking and meal prepping. I spend a LOT of time in the kitchen \n\n2) Weight lifting. I've found this is the most helpful for me. I love packing on the muscle and getting gains. \n\n3) Keeping temptation food out of the house. I have no willpower. If there is a bag of potato chips or box of cereal, it will be gone in 30 hours\n\n4) Find exercise you love. I love being fit and moving. But I really don't like YouTube workout videos or cardio that much. So currently I do a lot of biking, swimming, and weight lifting. And I recently started a bungee fitness class. \n\n5) Make it a habit and I swear that as time goes past, that habit will be so engrained you can't not do it. \n\nWhat motivates me is seeing older adults with limited mobility and not wanting to be that way down the road. And seeing older adults who are active and fit and wanting to be like them. And honestly, being fit and well nourished just feels dang good! I'm so used to being healthy that when I get off track, I quickly start feeling crappy. I hate that feeling. I hate being sedentary.

Nothing has changed my body like lifting weights. I use Apple Fitness+ at home with a mix of 10/15/20 lb weights - I don't even go to the gym. My Apple Watch records an average of 45 min of exercise 7 days a week.\n\nFood was a bigger challenge for me. I used to avoid planning meals and would just wing it at the grocery store. I also was very into using the Magnolia Cookbooks and any random recipe I found on Pinterest. Have you ever looked up a recipe out of desperation because you have two ingredients? Yeah, the solution is always to add pasta and cream cheese. I found the \"Skinny Taste\" cookbooks and website and everything changed. I meal plan and prep three dinners per week and two lunch options for myself. 90% of what I've made from the mix of cookbooks I own have been amazing, I cannot recommend them enough.\n\nFull disclosure: I am 5'1\" \\~120 lbs right now. Outside of being pregnant twice I am only about 5lbs different from where I was when I was 20 (almost 40 now). I started putting in an effort after my second kid and felt my body start to change.

The bastards were right when they say activity, water, and clean eating makes you happy. Dammit. But in all honesty, it’s seeing the small changes and feeling like I have more energy. You are way more capable than you give your body credit for and it’s awesome. Half the battle is mental. Psyching yourself out saying “I’ll never be a runner” or “I could ever do that it’s not who I am” literally you’d be surprised. The important thing is take it baby step by baby step, don’t kill yourself every time bc you might feel accomplished after that one work out but getting yourself to go back when you think it’s going to be brutal is harder. Slow build. Be patient. \n\nAlso I’ve seen two grandparents age: 1 was fit (fit means a lot to a lot of ppl, find fit for you) and the other was healthy enough but didn’t stay active or fit.

I had to stop, unfortunately, as I had an underlying muscular-skeletal issue, and I could theoretically keep cycling but I haven’t yet worked out a way to do it without issues.  These days I do a lot of step-based workouts like incline walking and regular outdoor hikes.  I am a huge believer in walking - people do not walk nearly enough, in my opinion.\n\nBut as a regular form of cardio, cycling just ticks off every box for me:  it gets you outside, it’s a fun way to explore the world (even if it’s “just” your local town), it feels like being a kid, and it burns a ton of calories.  There is a big sense of accomplishment in finishing a ride.  I hope to find a way to do it again.\n\nI also strength train.  I had to stop training for some time.  But the good thing about strength, is that if you ever got really strong once, it becomes easier to get it back.\n\nIn my 20’s, it took me months to be able to pick up certain weights.

I don't really count calories but I go heavy on protein and fat, light on carbs, and try to always include something green.  \n\nI try to let myself get actually hungry before I eat, not starving, just hungry instead of munchy.  I find if I'm never hungry, I'm gaining weight.  If I get a little hungry in the evening, I'll have something small like pistachios or a cheese stick.\n\nExercise:  It's easier if you can find something social you enjoy.  I'm on a competitive rowing team, we train together and go to regattas.  If I don't feel like working out, I still do because my crew is counting on me.\n\nI started doing yoga online a couple of years ago and it's been great.  I do at least 30 min every evening, it's a great way to relax for bed and has really firmed up my arms.\n\nAlcohol:  I quit drinking entirely and my weight has dropped to it's lowest in my adult life (I was never all that overweight but maybe a bit chubby).  I also feel great all the time.  I hadn't intended to quit but the effects have been so good, I'm never going back.\n\n## Comment ID jluqou2 with +1 score by [(Faeriecrypt, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jluqou2/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI started exercising regularly when I turned 30, and I feel a lot better overall. \n\nM-F, I wake up at 5 and do a mix of Walk at Home and Fit by Mik in the living room for about an hour.

I dunno. Being healthy? Let me tell you what I do! I'm in my early 50s and I think I'm in good shape, at least as good as I was in my 20s, even though I'm a bit heavier now (5' 4.5\", hovering around 145 pounds, whereas at age 30 I was about 10 pounds lighter). My weight has been pretty stable since having kids, but I do occasionally diet to knock a few pounds off (5-10, which I can do in a month or two, then go back to normal).\n\nI've always walked a few miles most days. For a while in my 20s and 30s I did martial arts, which I enjoyed and was good for me socially. I did lose some fitness when my kids were young because of disrupted sleep and the stress of living with young kids and a man-child. A couple of years ago I took up running and now I run about 20 miles/week, which is great for my mental health as well as whatever it does physically. \n\nI do prioritize sleep -- I go to bed early-ish and wake up pretty early, too. I'm starting to prioritize eating more protein, but I don't have a very restrictive diet. On days when I don't do a long run, I generally stick to 3 meals/day and no significant snacks. I also cook, so most of my diet comes from \"real\" ingredients, rather than packaged convenience foods... but my kids (and my ex) like them so I'm not a purist. I ran a trail half marathon this morning and I just ate half a pint of Ben & Jerrys because I wanted it. \n\nBut yeah, stay active, do things you enjoy, sleep enough, and eat well.\n\nAlso I've cut way back on alcohol and avoiding alcohol makes a huge difference, too.\n\n## Comment ID jluuujc with +1 score by [(PeachyKeenest, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jluuujc/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nEating right - I got a nutritionist after awhile and proteins are the way to go.

For example, I have a friend that lost a ton of weight by becoming a marathon runner, she's competitive, so her main motivation was to keep running so she could do better in races. That worked for her, while I, someone who isn't competitive but is more goal oriented, just set weekly fitness goals. Stuff like go to the gym at least 3 times this week. \n\nConsidering how I get a hit of dopamine by accomplishing weekly goals, and how my friend gets a hit of dopamine when her run is a little bit faster, the secret to finding a healthy lifestyle that works for you is figuring out what healthy activities and habits release dopamine in your brain. The reason this is important because dopamine also motivates us to take action, its not only the reward.\n\nSo if the investment in our health is something that genuinely makes us happy, it is easier to be motivated to maintain that investment. At first it will be hard, because your brain may be more motivated to do unhealthy things, and it will take some experimentation to find an activity or diet that you enjoy. However once you figure out what works for you and you start sticking to it consistently, maintaining a healthy lifestyle gets easier and easier.  \n\n\nI like to say eating healthy and working out isn't hard. What's hard is changing your lifestyle.\n\n## Comment ID jlv7qld with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlv7qld/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nWhat do you mean by 'looking healthy'?\n\n## Comment ID jlv84n3 with +1 score by [(StrawberryKiss2559, Reddit, 2023-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlv84n3/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nI did nothing different than my 20s.

Plenty of fiber.  But everything in moderation (I love sweets and beer and do indulge, again in moderation, without guilt).\n\nExercise:  My main source of exercise is running.  I love it.  I supplement with about 30-60 minutes of strength training a week, or online yoga classes.  But the BIGGEST thing I have done for my body is getting to the source of my various aches and pains.  Sore knees, a bad back, plantar fasciitis.... these are all things that I could have used as excuses to stop exercising.  But instead I put in a lot of work to figure out the root causes of all of these problems (spoiler alert: muscle imbalances or tightness, every single one), and as a result I'm running my fourth half marathon tomorrow at the age of almost 41.  I'm in better shape than I was ten years ago, by far.\n\nMotivation:  I've always been pretty disciplined in this regard.

I packed on weight, had blood sugar issues and skin tags on my neck that were indicating pre diabetes, and I was suffering from lots of reflux, aches pains and inflammation. It got to the point where some days the inflammation was so bad I could barely walk, and nearly everything I ate or drank would result in days of reflux/heartburn - so I had to make big change. At first I went to the doctor and they put me on anti inflammatory meds which helped with inflammation, but made the reflux worse and I started to develop a stomach ulcer. I got cranky about taking drugs that made things worse, went on a research frenzy, and decided to address it myself with diet and exercise. My whole body has changed in the last eight months. I started on a vegan diet, but not strictly, about 70-80% of the time. I find if it’s too strict I get annoyed and abandon it, so now my motto is being good most of the time. This helped reduce the inflammation. I would say I experienced about 80% reduction in pain and inflammation within days of going vegan. I stopped drinking alcohol too, and stuck to a vegan diet for about 3 months. It helped get me to the point where I could start thinking about exercise bc before that I was in so much pain it would not have been possible. After a while on vegan diet I noticed that I was overeating and the blood sugar issues were not improving. I was ravenous and always prowling in the kitchen, so I decided to go mostly keto as it’s as clear I was still on a blood sugar spike and drop cycle. I started drinking a Yerba mate supplement in the mornings to help manage blood sugar and suppress cravings and it made a huge difference. I now usually don’t eat breakfast, I have a Yerba mate and have my first keto meal at midday, and my dinner - also keto - at around 5pm. After being on keto 70-80% of the time for a month I was losing so much weight that I had to increase my calories bc I was getting stretch marks (I hadn’t had any since I was a teen and I forgot how much they hurt!). So if I am out of my house now I eat whatever I like and drink alcohol, but at home it’s keto only. Weight loss wasn’t the goal but since going mostly keto I’ve dropped close to 14kg. When I went keto I also started doing reformer Pilates twice a week, and I try to walk more. Pilates has made a world of difference, I feel so strong and I stand taller. I realised I don’t like pointless walking, so I make sure to book social events where I have enough time to walk into the city after work (about 40min - an hour once or twice a week). It feels like I can maintain this forever and continue to add new good habits to this baseline I’ve created. I’m still losing weight but much more slowly, and I don’t feel deprived. I wish I had started this younger. There’s so much advice and many opinions on what you should do - it’s confusing. I had to try a few things and see what worked for me bc we are all a little different. I have ADHD which means that unless I love something or it’s purposeful (exercise) I won’t stick with it, and ordering pre-cooked keto meals saves me time money and food waste. I would have loved to stay vegan morally, but I just couldn’t make it work for my body long term and I’m glad I listened to my body.\n\n## Comment ID jlvusmv with +1 score by [(MongooseInCharmeuse, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlvusmv/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nWeight lifting & rucking (walking increasing distances while increasing weight).

On days I'm not tired I lift weights or jog. On days I'm tired I just play some fitness or dance game on switch and call it a day. I wear a smart watch to keep track of it. I think strength training is important and some women avoid it to avoid turning into the hulk. Let me tell you that's close to impossible. I've worked out for years and focusing on strength these past few months and I'm still tiny. Gaining muscle is harder than you think and you won't accidentally turn into the hulk.\n\nI don't cook my own meals so I don't get much choice. I just cut out sugary drinks and alcohol. I'm Asian so meals tend to be heavy on rice and noodles so i try to have a smaller portion of rice (less than my proteins) That's about it. \n\nMy motivation? Health honestly.

As I got older I got tired much quicker throughout the days and it's easy to get into the mindset of 'I'll do it tomorrow' in terms of healthy eating and exercise. But I've wavered enough times to remember the feeling of being sick and unwell from a bad diet and how much less pain I'm in when I eat well and exercise. So I always make sure my mindset is clear and put lots of willpower into looking after myself. If you don't feel like you have willpower, literally sternly tell yourself out loud 'you ARE going to do it, and you ARE going to feel great after' and just propel yourself along to whatever your fitness goals are. If you tell yourself you're too tired (or can't be bothered) you effectively talk yourself into not doing it when in reality you can. Even if you fail after 2 minutes, it's better to do that than never to have tried at all. This has kept me mentally at my happiest and at my physical peak. \n\n - Also calories in Vs calories out is vital for fitness goals, exercise can be as hard or light as you want depending on what your personal goals are.\n\n## Comment ID jlvz9r7 with +1 score by [(Mor_Tearach, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/13t7szo/women_who_have_stayed_fit_after_30_what_is_your/jlvz9r7/) (in reply to ID 13t7szo):\nHonestly?

I know people who flourish on intermittent fasting, keto and quite restrictive diets. I can not. I realised I’m a volume eater, so I do really well on a Mediterranean diet - unlimited whole grains, legumes, fruit, veg, some dairy, fish a couple of times a week, red meat once or twice a month, some chicken but a whole lot of vegetarian days.  I lost so much weight I had to reintroduce cake, though I tried to make ones with nutritional value (fruit, nuts, various grain flours), but real sugar and butter. \n\nMeal planning and meal prepping were essential for me to stick to it, I never had to cook very much during my work week, I was allowed to snack as much as I wanted, but it had to be substantial and nutritious, so if I was emotional eating I’d get full too quickly and stop. So I kept a variety of foods to meet these snacking requirements in the house. \n\nI also worked a non-sedentary job (nursing) and took the stairs. I wasn’t OTT with working out, but I did press ups and sit ups a couple of times a week, went swimming or trail walking once or twice a week and walked around the block if I felt like I needed some activity. \n\nThen I had kids, had a whole bunch of food aversions while pregnant, have much less time and have to cook family meals and kids go too slow to get a good brisk walk in.

I go to CrossFit 3x a week which Is always varied , then I do a more traditional program 2-3x a week (this depends on how Im feeling- if I need rest, I always take it) I walk for about an hour on my lunch break when it’s nice outside. On days I don’t go to the gym I’m still usually active with some hiking or just a nice walk if I can fit it in.  Find what you enjoy and will stick to. \nI eat to fuel my workouts and feel good. Lots of protein, lots of veggies. I loosely track my macros. I decide my breakfast, lunch and dinners for the week and on Sunday I buy my groceries and meal prep for 3 days. On Wednesday night  I meal prep for 2 more. (I dont usually worry about prepping for weekends)\nDrinking lots of water. Listening to your body if it needs rest.

I need to get more active. But will the Whoop actually tell you if you are not being active enough as well? \n\nWith fitbit for example, the simple step counter does work as a bit of a motivator to reach that step goal every day. I am wondering what the motivator coming from wearing a Whoop is, or if there is any? I'm pretty sure I got the sleep part down. Want to start training more and just not sure how the Whoop would benefit me. I am stats geek and would love to get all those metrics, but.. yea.. wondering if they are the right metrics to motivate me to get more active or if this is the wrong tool for that. \n\nWould love to hear if any of you more sedentary people see benefit in this band to up your training and get motivated to do more/better training and get more active.\n\n## Comment ID ewo240v with +2 score by [(strongfranny, Reddit, 2019-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/cp9ndv/whoop_suitable_for_people_that_dont_overtrain_but/ewo240v/) (in reply to ID cp9ndv):\nI’m not sedentary but do a lot of powerlifting with long rests and not a lot of cardio data for the whoop to collect.

I wouldn’t recommend this is worth it for you if you say that you need motivation as it is better for telling you the data from really strenuous training (I guess this is why they focus more towards athletes than gen pop).

In other words, the fitbit incentivized walking/running, and that's it. I felt like I was wasting a workout if I did anything else, so all I did was run or go for super long walks. \n\nOn the other hand, without a tracker (as I have been the last few months), I fell into another bad pattern: all my workouts were easy. As a solo person working out, I was too lazy to push my heart rate. I would either lift heavy weight or go on easy breezy jogs. I did get strong, but but developed zero endurance. \n\nThis is where the whoop comes in: Every morning the whoop will tell me if I'm ready for a huge cardiovascular strain. As others have said, powerlifting, walks, etc will barely register, if at all, as straining. This pushed me to try different hard workouts to push my heart. Through some experimenting, I have found the best way to push my heart rate as much as possible. When I do this, invariably when I wake up the next day my body is not ready for high strain. These are the days I lift weights or go on easy walks. So for me, the whoops forces me to better balance my workouts. It doesn't penalize you for not pushing hard on high strain days, but you do feel a sense of leaving something on the table. Nor does it penalize you for switching up workouts, it doesn't care as long as your hr is up. I switch between running, rowing, jump rope, heavy bag boxing, kettlebell swing and box jumps. \n\nSo for me personally, if my sole goal is to get my hr up and keep it up as long as possible, I know I can do a workout that incorporates rounds of double unders for 10-20 minutes, and then jump on the rower for another 40 and I'm spent. I can'd do this every day or else my feet hurt, so I switch to something like kettlebell swings. In this way I'm more balanced, don't burn out as easily. \n\nTl;dr: whoop does motivate by pushing me to train hard some days but not all days, gives me motivation to balance.\n\n## Comment ID ewo2rkk with +1 score by [(tessa0k, Reddit, 2019-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/cp9ndv/whoop_suitable_for_people_that_dont_overtrain_but/ewo2rkk/) (in reply to ID cp9ndv):\nThank you for your response.

What are the specific FATfire means you take to optimize your longevity and quality of life? I will start it off with things that range from common sense to things that work for me. However, those are primarily budget-friendly so I want to hear your Fatfire suggestions- things like longevity clinics that focus on preventive medicine through regular screenings and advising on how to optimize health through diet, supplementation, lifestyle and risk factors. Im into things like the Huberman Podcast,\n\nCommon-Sense Stuff:\n\n\\-Exercise... basically as much as possible as far as I can tell cardio + strength training. If exercise is a huge chore for you do what you enjoy and what you can and don't beat yourself up about it. What is the fatfire approach to this during aging?\n\n\\-Diet: Whole non-processed foods, fruits veggies and not industrially produced meats. lots of leafy greens, not a lot of carbs especially the processed bullshit in the states, avoid sugar, avoid processed seed oils, have a caloric restriction for yourself, and stick to it, especially at specific times.\n\n\\-Fasting: Seems to be pretty important with the principal rule is don't always be eating\n\n\\-Have a strong social circle. A super underrated one that probably alludes people. Seek people through common interests and shared values. Community breeds purpose.\n\n\\-Purpose: Purpose breeds positive emotions\n\n\\-Mental health\n\n\\-Sleep optimization: How do fatfire folks optimize their sleep? I have terrible insomnia but understand the importance of sleep. Some common sense sleep approaches: avoid blue light at night, exercise, cool bedroom, breathe through your nose during rest and at all times, have a very dark sleeping area that is cool, Huberman's light exposure circadian stuff- aka get outside in the AM upon waking, as much as possible during the day, and at sunset. So basically go outside.\n\n\\-Outdoor Exposure: Is proven to improve health outcomes and gratitude.\n\n\\-Gratitude: Apparantly literally changes your brain like meditation.\n\n\\-Meditation: Expands your mind like breathing exercises\n\n\\-Breathing exercises: These have really worked for me and seem to be increasing in popularity. There seem to be two kinds IMHO uppers and downers. Exercises to upregulate your nervouse system and exercise to downregulate- use them respectively to get more awake and in your body and alert or to calm and relax and less alert.\n\n\\-Cold & Heat Exposure: I love both cold exposure and sauna and firmly believe in the associated health and wellness benefits. I consider them positive stressors- health optimization isn't about minimizing stressors. In fact, humans are considered anti-fragile whereby the system becomes more resilient in response to stress. However, chronic stress of a negative and environmental kind must be avoided at all costs- they will ruin you and destroy your health and well-being. Interestingly, an apparent key factor in how to determine if a stressor is positive or negative is your mindset. When I get into cold water I tell myself that it's for my own well-being and therefore it is, and even the though first part always sucks I wouldn't trade it for anything, and the endorphin rush after and during is amazing.\n\n\\-Positive Stressor Maximaztion & Negative/ Chronic Stress Minimization: Find some positive stressors that you can leverage \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome Random Things Not To Do Before We Get Into FatFire Ideas:\n\n\\-Smoke tobacco\n\n\\-Drink in Excess\n\n\\-Be Overweight\n\n\\-Use motor vehicles with extreme caution and never drive drunk\n\n\\-Use hard drugs\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFatfire?\n\n\\-Executive physicals (?)\n\n\\-Screenings for common diseases (could people specify exactly what these would be?)\n\n\\-Genetic Testing (what specifically should one be aware of in this space?

My thoughts:\n\n**The good:**\n\n1. Diet.  Single biggest driver of health.  FatFIRE add-on: private chef or meal prep service if you're not interested in cooking or don't want to put in the time to ensure that meals (and portion sizes!) are healthy.\n2. Exercise.  Close behind diet as the single biggest driver of health.  FatFIRE add-on: home gym and/or personal trainer to help ensure that it becomes a very regular habit and make sure that all major muscle groups are targeted.\n3. Mental aspects (social circle, meditating, calmness, good attitude): all important.  FatFIRE add-on: you can definitely help ensure that there's adequate bonding time by offering to foot the bill for some vacations/retreats, although you'll have to be careful to not do this to the point where others are taking advantage of your generosity.\n4. Sleep.  Perhaps something that a lot of FatFIRE people miss out on, since we're often driving hard for that bottom line.  FatFIRE add-ons: creating a bedroom that is sealed off from outside light, alarm clocks that wake you more slowly and naturally, investing in a high quality mattress, and making sure to structure your day to ensure that sleep is prioritized (for people with newborns, for example, a night nurse can help preserve sleep).\n5. Avoiding the negative health impacts you listed (smoking, drinking, carrying extra weight, drugs, risk-taking endeavors).  Ideally, if you are focused on health, you'd cut out drinking entirely.  There is no healthy level of alcohol.  (But we all must balance health with enjoyment!)\n6. Regular medical visits.  This is less for the doctor's check-up and more for the bloodwork/screenings.  It's good to have regular measurements of blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, teeth X-rays, and other health measurements.\n\n**The stuff that probably isn't worth it:**\n\n1. Fasting.  Fasting is still being researched, and while intermittent fasting does show benefits, I've seen the \"tech bros\" take it to extremes with full-day or multi-day fasts.  These can be dangerous and don't seem to offer any increased health benefits over shorter intervals.  Likely, many of the benefits of longer fasts are due to the reduction in caloric intake, rather than the fast itself.  I'd caution anyone against fasting regularly for longer than 12 hours, and against ever doing more than 24 hours at a time.\n2. Supplementation.  Supplements are the poor man's healthy diet.  Most supplements are unregulated, their claims unproven (and they can claim just about anything as long as they don't state that it *cures a disease*, as the FDA doesn't care), and their contents suspect.  Megadoses range from useless to actively dangerous/deadly.  Someone in FatFIRE can eat a far healthier diet than the average person, and has even less of a need of supplements.\n3. Probiotics.  This is actually my research background, and I can tell you that pretty much every commercial probiotic on the market is shit (no pun intended).  I could write a whole post on their issues.  Again, a healthy diet is a far better move than wasting time looking at probiotics.\n\n**Situationally useful:**\n\n1. Genetic testing.  Get a screening if you're going to be having children or if you would rather be forewarned about some genetic diseases (think Parkinson's Disease).  Keep in mind that most SNPs (single mutations) have a *very small* effect on health outcomes.  If you have a 3x risk of cancer but the average population incidence is only 0.1%, you still only have a 0.3% chance of developing that cancer.\n2. Wearables.  Great if you love data, but you still have to do the actual exercise.  They don't make the actual work any easier.\n3. Blood testing.  Only useful if you are monitoring a specific condition, in my opinion.  Otherwise, get it checked annually at your physical.\n4. Executive physicals/concierge medicine: depends on your wealth and if you want that personal touch.  They won't find diseases earlier, but they can be much better to work with if you are actively monitoring/treating a condition or if you have familial history of some disease.\n\n**Others not mentioned that I care about:**\n\n1. Pollution and microplastics exposure.  We don't know all the details of microplastic ingestion, but it's probably not great.  Limiting the plastic you eat from is one step, but the biggest steps you can take are to avoid synthetic fibers and to stay away from roads (one of the single largest sources of microplastics is tire dust).  \n2. Monitoring activity throughout the day.  Even if you spend an hour in the gym, spending the other 23 sedentary (like at a desk job, even if it's a really fancy desk) is not ideal.  \n3. Skincare!  Even just sunscreen + nightly cleanser + moisturizer is far better than what most men do.  Sunscreen is cheap but incredibly important for fighting both the appearance of aging and skin cancer.\n4. Water.  Don't drink sugary drinks, drink water.  \n\nI think that folks in FatFIRE love the idea of finding that secret trick that costs too much for most to afford, but the truth is that almost all of us would benefit more from improving the basics than trying the extremes.  Even the wealthy can have poor diets, carry excess weight, fail to exercise.\n\n### Comment ID innovdg with +17 score by [(santacruz_steve, Reddit, 2022-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/innovdg/) (in reply to ID innnsl4):\nEPIC answer TY!\n\n### Comment ID inq0ar0 with +16 score by [(dmacerz, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inq0ar0/) (in reply to ID innnsl4):\nFasting has a range of benefits from reducing calorie intake, stabilising blood sugars, giving the liver a break so it can regenerate, improving insulin and pre diabetes issues, resetting hormones. Arguably the single most important of all of them. \n\nProbiotics - some products sucks but what’s your take on kefir and live yoghurts? What about polyphenol supplements and prebiotic fibres like psyllium husk?

Regular intermittent fasting is a cornerstone in my life and 3 day fasts a couple times a year have had tremendous health benefits for me. They are not fun and definitely need to be done with caution. I.e. making sure your sodium, potassium and magnesium supplementation is on point - look up \"snake juice\" on Google for a DIY concoction.\n\n#### Comment ID inr7lot with +6 score by [(Romanticon, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inr7lot/) (in reply to ID inq0ar0):\nI agree on the benefits of fasting - but most of these benefits are also seen from intermittent fasting, and it's not been fully separated out how many of them are due to the act of fasting itself, or if they're due to reduction in caloric intake and better mindfulness of diet.  Fasting definitely plays some benefit, but it's likely a part of a larger whole.\n\nLess studied are the longer fasts, like fasting 23 hours per day or people who do extended \"water fasts\".  These can become very dangerous and seem unnecessary, when most benefits could be obtained from just doing regular intraday fasting.\n\nI'm glad to see others are aware of prebiotics!  I'm doubtful on yogurt/kefir, but very enthusiastic about encouraging greater intake of prebiotics.\n\nMy main argument against yogurts is that, while they do contain tons of live microbes, those are microbes evolved and ideally suited to live in cold, lactose-filled, oxygen-rich yogurt.  Your gut is none of those things.  There was a bunch of excitement early on because both yogurt cultures and gut microbiomes contain *Lactobacillus*, but that's a broad genus of bacteria and the individual species differ significantly in gut vs. yogurt.\n\nPrebiotics, for anyone else reading this who isn't familiar, are foods that don't provide direct nutritional benefit to us, but do act as a food source for our gut microbiome.  /u/dmacerz mentioned polyphenols and psyllium husk, but there are plenty of other prebiotics - they're usually labeled on nutrition facts as \"dietary fiber.\" Most are in the form of complex starches that aren't easily broken down by our own digestive enzymes, but can be eaten by our gut microbes.  The big payoff is that, when microbes are feasting on prebiotics, they eat less of the mucus lining of our intestinal tract, reducing chances of inflammation if they eat all the way through to the intestinal wall.\n\nPrebiotics are great, and we should be eating more of them.  This could be a supplement, but - again, as I discussed in my parent comment - a better method is to improve diet.  There are tons of foods with lots of fiber, mainly vegetables, and most modern people simply don't eat enough of them.  You could certainly supplement your diet with prebiotic fiber (pretty much anything with resistant starch and fiber is decent; some people just have potato starch), but you could also focus on naturally upping your fiber and resistant starch intake in the foods you eat.\n\n### Comment ID inppcpb with +10 score by [(CupResponsible797, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inppcpb/) (in reply to ID innnsl4):\nSome supplements like creatine are indisputably “worth it”.\n\n### Comment ID inxp2pu with +2 score by [(blablooblan, Reddit, 2022-09-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inxp2pu/) (in reply to ID innnsl4):\nAny skin care brand recs for men?\n\n#### Comment ID inxvodl with +3 score by [(Romanticon, Reddit, 2022-09-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inxvodl/) (in reply to ID inxp2pu):\nI personally like NIVEA's moisturizer that also has SPF 15, because I'm lazy and don't want to bother with multiple creams if I can help it...\n\n...but I'm no shill, and I think more importantly, it depends on your skin type.  I've got oily skin so I try to look for moisturizers that won't add to that, but someone with dry skin will probably have different preferences.\n\nThere are some really nice skincare routines out there, but I just can't muster up the effort right now to dive really deep into them.  Sunscreen, moisturizer, and nighttime cleanser to take all the dirt off, that's about all I can handle, and I'd rather be consistent than striving for insane perfection.\n\n#### Comment ID io025el with +2 score by [(cshah3, Reddit, 2022-09-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/io025el/) (in reply to ID inxp2pu):\nI like Jack Black products.\n\n### Comment ID io0ke47 with +2 score by [(catdog123412, Reddit, 2022-09-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/io0ke47/) (in reply to ID innnsl4):\nI agree most supplements don't have a lot of support, but you don't think adding a high-quality omega 3 fish oil is beneficial?\n\n#### Comment ID io2h5fz with +3 score by [(Romanticon, Reddit, 2022-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/io2h5fz/) (in reply to ID io0ke47):\nI'd rather eat more fish!

My husband also did three sessions following a major surgery and his surgeon was stunned (his words) by how fast he was healing  at his one week post-op. \n\nA 10 session package (90min @2.2 atmospheres) in Austin runs $2K, and a 60-session package is $10k. \n\nNot sure if this is the sort of thing you’re looking for, but I’ve been so impressed by it that I had to chime in.\n\n### Comment ID intb6v9 with +3 score by [(santacruz_steve, Reddit, 2022-09-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/intb6v9/) (in reply to ID inq2eis):\nWell, I am a technical scuba diver so maybe I get this anyways :).\n\n### Comment ID ipeivlh with +1 score by [(alexanderleedmd13, Reddit, 2022-09-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/ipeivlh/) (in reply to ID inq2eis):\nDid you stop at 10 sessions?

As you know, the most impactful things we can do are related to good diet, exercise, sleep, and stress-control habits.. Once those things are in place, the more speculative interventions will likely have very small to zero incremental impact. All those supplements that look good in various studies don't add much if you have already optimized your diet with real food (especially fruit and veg). Definitely get an annual checkup, but running every test out there will have very modest additional benefit while significantly increasing the risk of overtreatment.\n\nAdvanced exercise interventions like low oxygen training (or high oxygen training or EWOT machines)? Remote ischemic conditioning? Yeah, I've tried them but honestly couldn't really tell you whether they are doing anything besides a placebo effect. I've even looked into hyperbaric oxygen treatments; again jury is still very much out. Perhaps in the future there will be magic bullets, but currently most of this is more hype than proven interventions.\n\nFinal point is that I think most people look for magic bullets, while avoiding the harder and vastly more evidence based lifestyle modifications. If this is all a hobby to you, then fine, go ahead and obsess over this.

Basically any chemical type names, non-actual food things. Try finding a solid farmer who raises free-range, high quality of life animals. Not only is it delicious, but you can feel and taste the difference. This obviously excludes restaurants, but a considerable amount actually knew and took pride in where they sourced their meat.  Worth asking and filtering that way.\n\nMaintain proper excretion/digestion. Walking does this—the impact of gravity gets it moving—proper portions and not filling your stomach often does as well. \n\nWhen doing a physical-spiritual practice, have in mind the psychobody. Practicing yoga or Qi Gong (or prayer in some traditions) can allow you access to your body in a way that you gain greater awareness of parts previously unknown. Not only does this translate to moving differently after discovering new muscles/movements you were unaware of, it leads to new neural connections so that you can process reality differently. Emotions are physically stored through different chemical markers in cells, and there’s been personality links to certain diseases and physical pathologies of the body. Cultivating a connection, compassion, and acceptance for things you might have had to store away long ago can maximize outcomes for health as well as a greater depth of life and knowledge of oneself as they got to this point.

Please help!\n\n## Comment ID lm9ksne with +6 score by [(RainbowFartingUnicrn, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/foshelter/comments/1fc3idi/whats_the_best_outfit/lm9ksne/) (in reply to ID 1fc3idi):\nMoldaver's Armor is generally regarded as having the best bonus SPECIAL for wasteland exploration. \n\n\nFor vault defense the outfit is irrelevant, as only weapon damage and indirectly, endurance, count for that. Endurance only counts from HP gain, if for some reason you are defending with dwellers not at lvl 50, then endurance outfits would be best \n\n\nFor questing, it's a matter of opinion, but I argue that the Expert Jumpsuit is best. Agility boosts basic attack speed. Perception makes the critical hit cross hair move slower, but that's just a matter of practice. Luck makes the critical meter fill faster, but improved basic DPS is better, in my opinion.\n\n## Comment ID lm61a8s with +6 score by [(Valarrian, Reddit, 2024-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/foshelter/comments/1fc3idi/whats_the_best_outfit/lm61a8s/) (in reply to ID 1fc3idi):\nScarred power armor for defending, +7 special for resource rooms, moldaver's armor for waste land explorers\n\n## Comment ID lm73lfq with +4 score by [(GeorgiaOregonTexas, Reddit, 2024-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/foshelter/comments/1fc3idi/whats_the_best_outfit/lm73lfq/) (in reply to ID 1fc3idi):\nAgility 7 is best for quests because of attack speed\n\n## Comment ID lmajpsr with +3 score by [(Miltroit, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/foshelter/comments/1fc3idi/whats_the_best_outfit/lmajpsr/) (in reply to ID 1fc3idi):\nSee the pinned FAQ and linked posts from it.\n\nQuests: [https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-20:-Quests](https://github.com/therabidsquirel/The-Fallout-Shelter-FAQ/wiki/Section-20:-Quests)\n\nIf not level 50, on quests, send at least one dweller with an outfit with added E they can share if they need to level up, because health. If level 50 or the other dwellers on a quest, then added Agility is most helpful, followed by Luck, then Perception. So either Agility jumpsuits, Luck outfits, or outfits with a blend of PAL are most useful.

They'll use fewer stimpacks if you optimize health. If level 50, then an outfit with at least +1E so they are radiation immune with E total at 11 (assuming you trained to 10 in E as soon as possible). If you can only equip rare outfits, then Robot armor or swimsuit are good for the added E and L. If you can make legendary outifts, Moldaver's armor or similar for added E and L to find legendary junk.

      "# [Sait Tunc receives NSF CAREER award to optimize health care systems for equitable outcomes on 2024-04-05](https://news.vt.edu/articles/2024/04/tunc-career-award.html)\nIn an effort to revolutionize the health care system through operations research and systems engineering, Sait Tunc, an assistant professor in the Grado Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, has received a National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award.\n\nThe CAREER program supports early career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education and lead advances in the missions of their department or organization. This five-year grant totaling $568,619 will support Tunc’s research on inefficiencies in health care systems, particularly with respect to organ transplants. And it couldn’t be more timely.\n\nTunc’s research regarding organ utilization comes at a pivotal time in the industry. While organ scarcity exists, there is also a significant level of underutilization. Roughly 25 percent of organs recovered from deceased donors go unused for a variety of reasons. Patients may refuse organ offers because they come from a relatively higher risk donor, or they may choose to wait to see if another “better” organ becomes available. Additionally, patients with access to higher quality health care may receive special priority.\n\n“I want to identify disadvantaged patients and improve their access to organs. Federal law prevents penalizing patients for rejecting organ offers, which creates a gap between what is optimal for the individuals and how they behave. One mechanism I developed identifies disadvantaged patient groups who have reduced access to organs, thus a higher mortality rate,” Tunc said.\n\nIn addition to matching organs to recipients more efficiently, Tunc also wants to ensure equitable access for all in need. Perhaps surprisingly, this means taking into consideration voluntary incentive mechanisms, which prioritize motivating patients based on data rather than removing the option of choice. For example, instead of mandating participation, such as forcing a patient to accept an organ of relatively lower quality, voluntary incentive mechanisms give patients agency by showing them why they could reject an organ, but why they’d be better off accepting it rather than, say, remaining on dialysis.\n\n“We use data modeling to prioritize these patients for organ offers that are most beneficial to them. This improves the match between donors and recipients and addresses the issue of organ underutilization,” Tunc said. “The challenge in organ procurement is not just about finding more donors, but ensuring that the organs are used efficiently and equitably. I want to bridge the gap between what is best for society and how individuals behave.”\n\nIncentivizing healthy behavior\n\nVoluntary incentive mechanisms work at large-scale and individual levels, and Tunc’s research addresses both. He investigates how these strategies lead to an increase in wellness-related behaviors, such as exercise or tobacco cessation. This aspect of his proposal aims to encourage healthier behaviors considering that not everyone has the same level of delay discounting and using someone’s willingness to adopt healthier activities based on what reward they would receive if they change their habits.\n\n“My primary goal with this research is to design and implement voluntary incentive mechanisms in the health care field, for both organizations and individuals,” Tunc said. “Rather than use coercion or mandated participation, voluntary incentive mechanisms encourage participants through rewards. These tend to make implementing new strategies easier compared to traditional approaches in health care and improve outcomes at the individual, organizational, and societal levels.”\n\nUsing voluntary incentive mechanisms, Tunc’s research seeks to\n\nAlleviate the burden of organ scarcity, reduce the size of the transplant waiting list, improve the access of marginalized groups to transplants, and mitigate waitlist deaths\n\nPartner with Organ Procurement Organizations to expand organ availability and overall procurement\n\nReduce disparities in transplant access, especially for those at a significant disadvantage, including older patients and patients of color\n\nAlign individual actions with societal health goals, promote healthy behaviors, and improve long-term health outcomes especially among those most in need, such as individuals living with addiction or obesity\n\nAs part of the National Science Foundation’s support for educational outreach, the impacts of Tunc’s award will span from undergraduate engineering students to medical professionals, including a partnership with Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Virginia State University (VSU).\n\nHealth care providers can adjust their response to patients based on their willingness to adopt healthier behaviors. Tunc is hopeful this strategy will encourage people to adopt healthier habits while feeling they have choices in their decision making.\n\n“It’s crucial to design programs that actually motivate people to adopt healthier behaviors by considering all these individual differences in delay discounting, which explains why some people might not find long-term rewards as enticing. People that show addictive behavior, for example, are typically associated with higher delay discounting,” Tunc said. “This will enable researchers to find strategies that work for different groups.”\n\nThe future of health care systems\n\nTunc plans to use this research as an opportunity to educate others on how operations research and systems engineering and the use of voluntary incentive mechanisms can be beneficial for those working in the health care field, including short courses for medical students on implementing voluntary incentive mechanisms, and research education that will benefit undergraduate and graduate students at Virginia Tech and beyond.\n\n\"Our partnership with VSU is quite detailed, providing summer undergraduate research assistantship opportunities for VSU students at Virginia Tech, and offering an in-person opportunity for them to engage with groups in our department and elsewhere at the university,” Tunc said. “We hope we can engage students from multiple backgrounds and disciplines to participate, and encourage them to consider health care-related studies.”\n\nTunc’s grant-related research has informed his curriculum, including two new graduate level courses addressing health systems. Looking even further, Tunc hopes the research will impact policymakers from the top down while solving this complex global challenge.\n\n\"Beyond the direct educational interventions, the outreach activities associated with this research aim for policy change at the national level,” Tunc said. “Engaging with key stakeholders and policymakers ensures that the outcomes of this research are understood and potentially integrated into the national health care system.”",
      "# [On offense: Proactively personalizing medicine to optimize health](https://pharmacy.osu.edu/news/offense-proactively-personalizing-medicine-optimize-health)\nLaura Lile, MD, RPh, BS Pharm ’87, a dual-credentialed physician and clinical pharmacist, is nationally sought after for her proactive approach to preventative health and wellness – primarily using genomics.\n\n“I started down this path for my own family because we have extremely high cardiovascular and stroke risk,” Dr. Lile said. “I wanted to see my mom and dad be able to live a longer life, rather than losing them at 70 years old, which was common in my family history.”\n\nDr. Lile’s career has always been in the details.\n\nAfter her mom had a heart attack at a young age, Dr. Lile began looking into epigenetics to understand what she could do to improve her mom’s health. However, she wanted to go further – asking ‘what is the root cause of the disease or condition that patients are experiencing?’\n\nNow, through her practice, Lile Wellness Partners, Dr. Lile partners with patients to provide precise and comprehensive insights into their genetic makeup through IntellxxDNA™ testing. In addition, she uses bloodwork as the primary basis for following trend analysis of patients – both healthy and unhealthy. The Lile Wellness team can then tinker with medicine and supplement regimens to attain optimal health for their patients’ individual needs.\n\n“We practice offense medicine, not defense,” Dr. Lile said. “We believe in getting to the root cause of a disease state or condition. Rather than treating the condition only, we look at what may be causing it, such as lifestyle or genetic predispositions, to optimize a patient’s health.”\n\nGenomic testing allows patients to understand their genome and then dial in to very specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to see their risk factors for certain conditions and disease states. Pharmacists and physicians can then use that information to understand how to work around those SNPs. Using the gene variants, the health care team can modify risk using targeted medicine and supplements and then monitor the patient’s response through bloodwork.\n\n“We use these reports to analyze genes that are present in very low percentages in the population, less than 5% to 10%. We question why these genes still exist in someone's gene pool while the rest of the world has evolved and gotten rid of them” Dr. Lile said. “We then take a deep dive into the research to see what those genes have a higher risk of causing. In isolation, these gene variants are helpful to know, but without the IntellxxDNA™ tool and the evidence-based recommendations that it provides, it can be scary to know you carry a high-risk gene. These clinical decision tools remove that fear because now we can decipher how to override that part of your genome.”\n\nDr. Lile says that PharmDs are the perfect health care practitioners to perform the complex work of interpreting a genomic test, due to their expertise in the usage of medicine and accessibility to patients.\n\n“To use this tool effectively, you don’t need to prescribe medicine. You are guiding patients with a clinical tool to understand their genome and the why behind disease states like diabetes or depression. You can provide them with a powerful tool that can be refreshed on a routine basis, putting the pharmacist in an excellent position to be the patient’s health care advocate. Genomic tools can expand the role of the pharmacist.”\n\nHer strong belief that pharmacists can play a vital role in this process led Dr. Lile to invite four Ohio State PharmD students to an IntellxxDNA™ conference in the summer of 2023. She felt that it was her pharmacy training – not her medical training – that enabled her to understand the extremely complex reports she receives through genetic testing.\n\nOne of the students who attended the conference, Class of 2024 PharmD candidate, Kate Pollock, has continued her work with Dr. Lile and will join the Lile Wellness team upon her graduation in May 2024 as the first full-time PharmD in the clinical practice who will see patients and complete consults, rather than filling prescriptions.\n\nEven before tools like IntellxxDNA™, Dr. Lile had been using patients’ bloodwork markers to narrow in on improving health outcomes. However, the IntellxxDNA™ report, provides an immediate roadmap to optimal health outcomes without having to guess what’s going on with only some of the information.\n\n“I’ve spent years tweaking medications and supplements in patients to ensure that I see the responses in their blood work that I expect to see. While I’ve been doing this for years, I now have a clinical decision support tool that can get patients to optimal medication support on day one because we know exactly what their body needs.”\n\nDr. Lile and Pollock both attest to the benefits that their patients are seeing through this DNA-targeted precision-based medicine approach.\n\n“It has been great to meet with patients at their follow-up visits and hear how they’ve been able to participate in things like hiking or exercise that they weren’t able to before the testing,” Pollock said. “Patients are seeing progress on their health goals faster because we are able to tailor their body’s unique needs to them.”\n\nThey both also say the key to this type of intervention being used more widely is for pharmacists to continue to advocate for the profession.\n\n“The power of this tool can exponentially expand the role of pharmacists,” Dr. Lile said. “Pharmacists understand this complex medication and supplement-related data and use it to advocate for, and partner with, our patients. We need to identify the skill sets and value that we have as pharmacists to be a part of the solution. We’ve been doing it for years – pharmacists have always been the trusted healthcare professional, especially in rural communities that routinely experience a shortage of doctors. This is a natural progression for the profession of pharmacy.”",
      "# [AHRQ Strategic Plan for Health System Transformation To Optimize Health, Functional Status, and Well-Being Among Older Adults](https://www.ahrq.gov/priority-populations/publications/aging-well.html)\nThe U.S. population is rapidly aging, and the health system is ill-prepared to meet the needs of older adults. Older adults and individuals with multiple chronic conditions frequently receive fragmented and sub-optimal care, leading to poor outcomes, including avoidable adverse events, hospitalizations, and institutionalization, as well as increased costs negatively impacting the sustainability of Medicare and state Medicaid programs.\n\nBy re-engineering healthcare delivery systems so that care transformation optimizes health outcomes, functional status, and well-being, much of the morbidity and premature mortality associated with aging can be delayed or slowed, and chronic conditions can be effectively managed, allowing people to live independently and contribute to their communities longer.\n\nThis Strategic Plan details five goals and related strategies to achieve these goals for health system transformation that optimizes the health, functional status, and well-being among older adults.",
      "# [RPM Healthcare Solutions and Benefits on 2024-02-06](https://optimize.health/blog/rpm-healthcare-benefits-challenges-solutions/)\nThe new era of chronic disease healthcare combines technology, data, insights and continuous care. With this approach, those with chronic conditions can achieve healthier outcomes. The key to this is remote patient monitoring (RPM). RPM healthcare delivers care continuity and real-time vital readings. As a result, physicians can make data-driven decisions.\n\nWhile RPM healthcare is expanding, thanks to improved clinical outcomes, increased reimbursements, and more sophisticated platforms, challenges persist. Those can be overcome with the right solutions, yielding benefits for practitioners and patients.\n\nIn this guide, you’ll learn about the benefits, challenges, and solutions of RPM.\n\nWhat is RPM healthcare?\n\nRPM healthcare describes remote care programs that use connected medical devices to monitor patient vitals between office visits. You can support a variety of chronic conditions with RPM, including:\n\nPatients take daily vital readings, such as blood pressure, A1C, weight, and oxygen saturation. These numbers automatically transmit into an RPM software platform. Clinicians review these readings, looking for any critical readings or trends that need intervention.\n\nThis is the basic workflow of an RPM program. The more data you collect, the better clinical decisions you can make. It supports improved quality of life for those with one or more chronic diseases.\n\nPutting an RPM plan in place is not without its challenges. Many of these correlate with building and sustaining a program.\n\nBenefits of RPM healthcare\n\nWhat can you expect from an RPM healthcare program? The benefits for patients and care teams are significant.\n\nCollect data to inform care decisions.\n\nThe age of data in healthcare delivers keen insights into how patients deal with chronic diseases daily. You wouldn’t be able to glean this from the few annual interactions you have with them. Visibility into conditions, their progression, and treatment effectiveness are now within reach.\n\nAll patients using RPM are at risk and often end up in the emergency department (ED). These may have been avoidable with RPM. Gathering data easily through connected devices gives you a clearer picture of each individual’s health. You’ll use this to adjust care plans, often leading to better clinical outcomes.\n\nStrengthen care coordination and continuity.\n\nThe patients you monitor with RPM may have multiple conditions. Care teams can include a variety of specialists along with primary care physicians. Ensuring all parties have access to the vital readings improves care coordination and continuity. Readings sync into the EHR (electronic health record). As a result, everyone has information, which removes blind spots.\n\nIntervene at the right time.\n\nAs noted, chronic condition patients often seek care in the ED. Without the connection between patients and clinical monitoring, people are more likely to head to the ED. This strains the healthcare system and often results in subpar care, as the physicians in the ED don’t know the patient’s history.\n\nIdeally, RPM should facilitate immediate mitigation. Studies support the idea that RPM does reduce ED visits and readmissions. A review of 91 studies on RPM and its impact on acute care determined that 49% reported decreases in ED visits.\n\nAchieving intervention requires an escalation process with monitoring teams. It should be a built-in feature in RPM software. It would involve these steps:\n\nGet insights into disease progression and treatment efficacy.\n\nChronic disease patients can be in many phases of their condition. Progression of it and treatment effectiveness are more concrete when you have daily vital data. Based on these learnings, you can discern if patients are seeing better outcomes. Those could include a drop in A1C, lower blood pressure, and weight loss.\n\nOn the other hand, you will also have information if these things worsen. Each piece of data sheds light on how a patient is managing their chronic disease. It can inform what you prescribe in terms of medication or activities. Vitals offer critical context to improving patient outcomes.\n\nImprove patient engagement.\n\nRPM can be an avenue for better patient engagement. With such a program, clinical monitoring teams have regular communication with patients and increase touchpoints. You’re engaging with them daily, which increases their ownership in the care plan. Patients who have not been able to keep up with follow-ups or complicated treatment plans now have an opportunity to be more involved in their health.\n\nGrow revenue with reimbursement support.\n\nThe central benefits of RPM healthcare relate to care and clinical outcomes. There is also the revenue aspect for practices. Ensuring that billing and reimbursements are part of the RPM solution you choose enables you to manage this more easily. The technology tracks the time spent with patients, which is crucial for claims.\n\nAdditionally, with clinical monitoring services, eligibility, and onboarding provided by your RPM vendor, you can expand the program to more patients, increasing reimbursement.\n\nIn reviewing the challenges and benefits of RPM, you’ll need a robust platform and clinical monitoring services to overcome the latter and realize the former.\n\nThe top challenges of deploying an RPM program and solutions\n\nEstablishing RPM healthcare has many dimensions and requirements. Many healthcare organizations have concerns about setting up RPM and allocating the resources to monitor patients. These challenges prevent practices and physicians from taking advantage of implementing such programs that would bring significant benefits to patients with chronic conditions.\n\nDefining patient populations that are a good match for RPM\n\nThe first part of the process is identifying which patients are good candidates for RPM. This would involve looking at the criteria of your patient population. The delivery of RPM services doesn’t require a specific diagnosis. Most likely, a substantial segment of your patients would benefit from RPM healthcare.\n\nSolution: Work with a seasoned RPM company to alleviate the burden of this step and have the vendor help you onboard suitable patients.\n\nEnsuring insurance eligibility\n\nOnce you identify patients, you’ll need to make sure their insurance covers RPM. Medicare and Medicaid have specific CPT® code reimbursements. Private insurance may also reimburse for RPM. It can be a lot of paper-pushing.\n\nSolution: Pass this on to your RPM vendor. They should use HIPAA-secure tools to determine insurance eligibility.\n\nGetting patients onboarded successfully\n\nEach patient using RPM must undergo onboarding and education on using their connected device and the importance of taking daily readings.\n\nSolution: Partner with an RPM service provider who supports patient onboarding and device shipping. The process should be easy for them and you. Onboarding should be flexible with on-site, virtual, or hybrid options. Your RPM healthcare vendor should also be able to handle shipping logistics for you.\n\nStaffing clinical monitoring\n\nThis RPM healthcare challenge is the most common. RPM requires constant monitoring by licensed healthcare professionals. Small practices and large healthcare systems each struggle with resource allocation.\n\nSolution: Outsource this to your RPM partner. Our U.S.-based, licensed nurses with clinical expertise monitor patients for you. It involves 1:1 engagement between nurses and patients. Nurses communicate with those using RPM devices, reminding them to take readings. They are the first point of contact for triage if these go outside the designated norm. If deemed serious, they escalate critical readings to physicians for intervention. Clinical monitoring services allow you to expand the RPM program with nurses who function as an extension of your care team.\n\nManaging billing and revenue\n\nAnother challenge healthcare providers may face is understanding the billing cycle and managing reimbursement. Without specific features in RPM software, it becomes cumbersome to keep documentation of the monitoring services provided manually.\n\nSolution: Choose an RPM software with features for measuring, calculating, and assessing revenue data.\n\nThese obstacles may be keeping you from launching RPM. The good news is that they are easy to overcome. When all these things are solvable, you and your patients realize the benefits of RPM.\n\nOptimize Health solutions for RPM healthcare\n\nIn building an RPM healthcare program, you’ll need solutions from a trusted partner that offers technology and monitoring services. Optimize Health is a leader in both. Here’s what you can expect from our solutions.\n\nRPM software that’s accessible and feature-rich\n\nThe heart of your RPM program is the software you use, and we provide a platform that includes all the functionality you’ll need to deploy and maintain your program, including:\n\nClinical monitoring services to power RPM programs\n\nIn this RPM solution discussion, there are also all the services needed to get a program started and to grow it.

RPM does NOT require a specific diagnosis.\n\nHow do connected devices and RPM software work together?\n\nDevices record the vitals and sync automatically with the software. The RPM solution will also share the data to the patient’s EHR. Readings can trigger alerts if they are outside of the thresholds set, and data exchange occurs continuously.\n\nWhat types of RPM devices are available?\n\nThe most common include:\n\nAre RPM devices safe, secure, and compliant?\n\nAll devices we provide are FDA-approved and HIPAA-compliant. The agency requires many components to ensure they are safe to use. Additionally, manufacturers must have processes in place for data security.\n\nWho can provide RPM clinical monitoring services to patients?\n\nClinical staff under the general supervision of a physician can perform monitoring.

      "# [Revolutionizing Indoor Air Quality: How Smart HVAC Systems Optimize Health and Efficiency by Andrew Froehlich on 2024-10-10](https://www.buildings.com/resiliency-sustainability/health-wellness-iaq/article/55234100/revolutionizing-indoor-air-quality-how-smart-hvac-systems-optimize-health-and-efficiency)\nTechnology is advancing to the point where indoor air quality (IAQ) can rival outdoor air. To achieve this, however, it takes advanced HVAC systems that are continuously maintained for optimization. Fortunately, new technologies are assisting in our quest, making every breath while inside smart buildings a clean and healthy one.\n\nThe Importance of IAQ\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that “on average, Americans spend approximately 90 percent of their time indoors, where the concentrations of some pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than typical outdoor concentrations.”\n\nThese pollutants have been shown to affect our health and cognitive abilities. For business owners, poor air quality often translates into increased absenteeism, impacting their bottom line. Thus, the advantages of investing in modern HVAC systems that can optimize air quality can not only positively affect health concerns, but the operational productivity of occupants as well.\n\nHow Modern Smart HVAC Systems Work\n\nModern HVAC systems in smart buildings have the ability to adapt to external pollution levels and occupancy levels, which both play a critical role in delivering fresh air to all or portions of a facility. Advancements include:\n\nNew HEPA and Activated Carbon filter systems to remove microscopic containments and pollutants\n\nOn-demand ventilation systems that make adjustments in real-time\n\nUV light and electrical charge systems to kill pathogens and trap particles missed by filtration systems\n\nCorrosion-resistant heat exchangers to prevent air stream contamination\n\nMold and mildew prevention systems\n\nMulti-zone systems that allow for customized air quality adjustments based on occupancy\n\nAll the advancements and benefits found in modern smart HVAC systems come with one major drawback: they require constant upkeep and maintenance to achieve maximum results. This increase in maintenance may prevent building owners and operators from investing in them due to the perceived cost of hiring a team of HVAC professionals to monitor systems and keep them operating efficiently. Fortunately, technology is here to the rescue as well.\n\nSmart HVAC System Monitoring and Management\n\nLike modern automobiles with advanced fuel efficiency systems and electronics, they’ve become increasingly complex to maintain. The same is often said about smart building HVAC systems. But with the right monitoring and management tools in place, smart HVAC systems are easy to maintain.\n\nHere are a few examples of how technology keeps these systems operationally effective:\n\nSensor Technologies. IoT sensors that are strategically deployed within a building monitor various HVAC and air quality metrics, including temperature, humidity, O2/CO2 levels, and occupancy counts. This delivers real-time data that can be used within smart HVAC systems to make automated adjustments.\n\nCentralized monitoring and alerting. In most cases, HVAC control platforms can integrate with a Building Management System (BMS). Doing so allows for a wider range of information gathering and consolidation that delivers more accurate information on which to base HVAC changes.\n\nAI/ML Data Analysis. Collecting data is one thing, but figuring out what to do with the information is another. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) lets software make those decisions on your behalf. With a bit of fine-tuning within the HVAC orchestration platform, AI and ML can make the minor adjustments required to optimize air quality far better than could be accomplished with a team of HVAC technicians.\n\nSoftware-centric feature updates. The beauty of modern HVAC systems is that they’ve largely become software-centric. This means that the HVAC vendor can provide software updates to fix bugs and introduce new features that potentially deliver greater air quality improvements throughout the system’s operational lifespan.\n\nBreathtakingly Good Indoor Air Quality\n\nGiven the ongoing advancements in smart building technologies, intelligent HAVC systems is an area that delivers benefits to business owners/operators and their occupants. Owners and operators gain obligatory energy efficiencies while occupants improve their health and operational performance.\n\nIt’s a win-win situation for both. After all, who doesn’t like fresh air?",
