      "# [Optimize Health](https://optimize.health/blogs/)\nCCM Physician Type/Specialty RPM\n\nHow ACOs Can Leverage Chronic Disease Management Software\n\nSo, What’s Wrong with My Program Today? Each RPM/CCM program is unique to the practice it serves, but there are common pitfalls that many providers face. At OptimizeHealth, we’ve worked with numerous practices to rescue failing RPM and CCM programs. The issues we encounter most often fall into a few key categories—areas where many partners in the Remote Care industry simply miss the mark. Let’s Dive In You Can’t Easily View Your Patients’ Vitals Over Time Regardless of how many patients you have enrolled in your RPM program, monitoring their progress over time is crucial. The ability to see trends in their vitals—such as blood pressure readings over the last 30 or 90 days—gives you a clearer picture of whether they’re receiving the right care. If your current system doesn’t provide clear visualizations and averages of patient data, you’re likely working with an outdated RPM partner. All that valuable data is going underutilized, limiting the potential for improving patient outcomes. The People Monitoring Your Patients Aren’t Based in the U.S. Unfortunately, we see many RPM and CCM companies outsource monitoring services to save costs, but this often places a burden on your patients. When patients need to speak with someone regularly, having caregivers based outside the U.S. introduces several challenges: Communication Barriers: Caregivers who don’t speak English as their first language can struggle to communicate effectively with patients, particularly the elderly who may already have difficulty hearing. This can lead to misunderstandings and poor care outcomes. Timing Issues: When caregivers operate in different time zones, they may contact patients at inconvenient times—early in the morning or late at night—when patients are less likely to be receptive. This not only reduces the effectiveness of the care but can also create frustration for patients. The Remote Care Partner You Have Doesn’t Consistently and Clearly Communicate With Your Practice Staff A successful RPM and CCM program hinges not only on technology but also on the frequency and quality of communication between healthcare providers, their staff, and their RPM/CCM partner. Programs that fail to maintain regular touchpoints with providers and their clinical staff, or that lack clear communication, will ultimately struggle with both patient care and financial outcomes. Communication with your remote care partners should be easy, consistent, and continually improving. When this is achieved, the goals for your RPM and/or CCM programs are clearly outlined, along with a plan to reach and maintain those goals. At OptimizeHealth, we prioritize consistent, meaningful interactions with patients, ensuring they stay engaged and informed about their care. This proactive approach, combined with clear and continuous communication with the clinic, sets the foundation for successful patient outcomes and overall program success. Supporting Clinical Monitoring When Providers Are Away When schedules are busy and in-office days are reduced, RPM and CCM offer invaluable resources to manage patient care. These programs allow clinicians to maintain ‘eyes and ears’ on their patients even when they are not physically present. This continuous monitoring is beneficial for clinical outcomes, providing peace of mind to both providers and patients that health metrics are being watched and managed in real-time. The Software You’re Using Doesn’t Have Easy-to-Use Billing Reports While the primary goal of RPM and CCM services is to provide the best possible care to your patients outside the office, financial viability matters too. If your current software doesn’t allow you to easily generate and export billing reports for each patient, you may be wasting valuable time trying to determine whether these programs are profitable for your practice. Your billing reports should include the following: Patients that qualify for each CPT code with expected reimbursement amounts: This ensures you know exactly what to bill for each service and helps you predict your revenue accurately. Total profitability for your entire patient population within a calendar month: This allows you to assess the overall financial health of your RPM and CCM programs, giving you a clear view of their impact on your practice’s bottom line. The ability to generate reports for either RPM, CCM, or both combined to show total expected reimbursement: Flexibility in reporting enables you to analyze and optimize each program individually or together, ensuring you’re maximizing your practice’s financial efficiency. Partnering for Success: A Collaborative Approach In RPM and CCM programs, having a partner invested in your success is key. When your practice thrives financially, so does your RPM/CCM partner. At OptimizeHealth, we work as an extension of your team, helping you maximize reimbursements and achieve the best outcomes for both your patients and your practice. Together, we can ensure your programs are effective and financially sustainable. The Bottom Line If any of these issues sound familiar, it might be time to reassess your current RPM/CCM partnership. The right tools and support can make all the difference in transforming your program from a source of frustration to a vital part of your practice’s success. OptimizeHealth specializes in helping practices like yours optimize their remote care programs. Let’s work together to ensure your RPM and CCM programs deliver the care your patients deserve.",

The data also becomes part of the patient’s electronic health record. Those readings can initiate alerts if they are outside of the thresholds that you set for patients. The data exchange occurs continuously.\n\nThe software automatically tracks the number of patient readings and the engagement time. Adding manual time spent on evaluations and consultations is also available. With sorting filters, you can view readings and engagement minutes by patient to determine who is on track to meet monthly billing requirements. The system also tracks whether the patient has completed the synchronous call requirement to bill. You can export all data identifying eligible patients from the billing tab to your billing system.\n\nOur software and all supporting services, including insurance eligibility verification, are HIPAA compliant. Our software uses the agile methodology, so we can quickly integrate the latest CMS guidelines into the platform. This ensures you are always compliant and have a complete audit trail if needed.",
      "# [Remote Patient Monitoring Devices on 2023-11-02](https://optimize.health/connected-devices/)\nAll devices we provide are FDA-approved. The agency has many protocols to ensure they are safe to use. Additionally, manufacturers must have provisions in place for data security to mitigate the risk that’s inherent with internet-connected devices. The security guidelines also adhere to HIPAA compliance mandates.\n\nOnce devices are on your network, data encryption, cybersecurity best practices, compliance, and privacy regulations remain a priority.\n\nCellular connectivity and Bluetooth are the most common ways to connect devices online. If using a cellular network, there’s no need for a smartphone, which is a Bluetooth requirement.\n\nConnecting via Bluetooth can also be cumbersome for patients because they need to “pair” the device and their phone. Reliable and uninterrupted internet access is a requirement for Bluetooth, while cellular has broader coverage and is the easiest to set up. The device is ready right out of the box.\n\nOnce you implement our RPM software, you will work with our implementation experts to order the relevant FDA-compliant connected devices. We can deliver them directly to patient homes. After training and implementation, data begins to transmit from the devices to your RPM platform. Your program for remote care is ready, with accurate and reliable data at your fingertips.",

      "# [Remote Healthcare on 2024-03-20](https://optimize.health/remote-healthcare/)\nHealthcare companies have developed healthcare software that provides remote health solutions using digital tools such as monitoring devices. These solutions allow medical service providers to track and test patients outside traditional healthcare settings, leading to better health services and improved patient outcomes.\n\nAt its core, remote healthcare involves monitoring tools and software platforms. Patient monitoring devices can track vital health metrics like blood pressure, blood glucose, and weight and automatically send that information to caregivers. This continuous monitoring allows providers to spot real-time health changes and potential issues. *Remote care* software platforms then aggregate all this data to give medical professionals a single view of each patient’s health status and progress.\n\nWith these insights, remote healthcare companies can proactively manage patient care plans. They can also easily coordinate care teams and communicate with patients and caregivers more effectively. As a result, providers can spend less time reacting to health crises and more time preventing issues and catching problems early. For patients, remote healthcare means convenience since they can receive routine check-ins, ask and answer questions, and adjust medication from the comfort of their own homes.\n\nRemote patient monitoring is typically used for managing chronic conditions. However, the benefits of remote healthcare extend to post-hospital care, complex disease management, and general population health. RPM companies continuously improve monitoring devices and software platforms, and that means remote care will become an even more critical component of how healthcare is delivered in the future.\n\nThe opportunities for improving outcomes and patient experience through remote healthcare solutions are endless. Remote monitoring programs that use wearable devices, mobile apps, and telehealth tools have the power to uncover new insights. They can detect health changes that traditional in-office visits miss.\n\nInnovative remote health companies are leading the way toward a future in which healthcare will undoubtedly include more virtual visits. It will also involve remote patient monitoring and software, which will enhance the capabilities of providers and care teams.\n\nRemote healthcare relies heavily on technology to provide remote health services to patients at home. With remote healthcare platforms, patients can access medical staff without visiting a doctor’s office. In addition, patients can get essential healthcare services and monitor chronic conditions from their homes.\n\nBy using such technology, healthcare providers gain tools that give them a better picture of a patient’s health between office visits. With this transformation of how patients access and receive medical care, medical staff can be more proactive in caring for patients and addressing issues before they become serious.\n\nSome examples of remote healthcare services include:\n\nTelemedicine: Patients have virtual consultations with doctors and specialists via video or phone instead of in-person visits. This allows patients to get medical advice and assistance from a distance.\n\nRemote patient monitoring: Patients with chronic conditions can use devices and sensors at home that transmit health data. Vital signs, such as blood pressure, pulse, and breathing rates, along with blood sugar levels and weight, are transmitted remotely to healthcare providers. This allows providers to monitor patients’ health between in-person checkups.\n\nePrescriptions: Doctors send prescriptions electronically to pharmacies instead of providing a physical piece of paper, which streamlines the process for patients to get their medications.\n\nOnline health assessments: Patients can complete health surveys and questionnaires online to assess their symptoms and overall health. This can help identify potential issues and direct them to the right provider or treatment options.\n\nVirtual therapists and counseling: Patients can connect with mental health providers through video calls and messaging apps to get emotional support and therapy from anywhere.\n\nOnline appointment scheduling: Patients can schedule and manage their appointments through an online portal or app connected to their healthcare provider, eliminating the need to call during office hours.\n\nRemote healthcare is more accessible and convenient for patients while helping providers improve the quality and effectiveness of their care. As technology progresses, it will continue to transform how patients interact with the entire healthcare system.\n\nRemote healthcare monitoring refers to using technology to monitor patients from a distance outside medical facilities. With remote health monitoring devices and systems, patients can receive care and track their health from home.\n\nIt helps achieve improved health outcomes by enabling early detection of health changes, reducing hospital readmissions, improving medication adherence, and streamlining follow-up care. This is done through a remote health monitoring system that sends patient health data to clinicians and care teams in close to real-time.\n\nSeveral remote healthcare monitoring systems and devices can monitor patients’ conditions from afar. They include the following:\n\nBlood Pressure Monitors: These are cuff-based monitors that patients can use at home to measure and transmit their blood pressure readings to their doctors. Doctors can monitor for high or low blood pressure issues.\n\nWeight Scales: Smart weight scales can measure a patient’s weight and body composition, then send that data wirelessly to their doctor or care team. This helps monitor for weight gain or loss issues.\n\nGlucose Monitors: Continuous glucose monitors use a small sensor inserted under the skin to constantly measure blood sugar levels in diabetic patients. They can transmit readings to an app for patients and doctors to monitor.\n\nECG Monitors: Electrocardiogram devices can measure a patient’s heart rhythm and electrical activity. The data is transmitted to doctors who can monitor for arrhythmias or other cardiac issues.\n\nOxygen Saturation Monitors: Pulse oximeters clip onto a patient’s finger to measure blood oxygen levels. Chronic conditions like COPD require frequent monitoring, so wireless oximeters send readings to doctors to detect issues early.\n\nActivity Trackers: Fitness trackers and smartwatches can track patients’ activity levels, steps, sleep, etc., and share that data with doctors to monitor mobility issues and functional decline.\n\nCameras/Sensors: In-home sensors and camera systems allow remote patient monitoring, which is particularly helpful for older adults and people with cognitive issues. Motion sensors can detect if a patient has fallen, and cameras can allow medical professionals to visually check in on high-risk patients.\n\nAll these remote health monitoring devices work like an early warning system. They alert clinicians about an anomaly before a small problem becomes a significant health issue.",

      "# [Managed RPM Services Help Staff Shortages on 2021-12-10](https://optimize.health/blog/staffing-shortages/)\nStaffing shortages are, unfortunately, nothing new for many healthcare organizations. Many pandemic-related factors, including increasing retirements and resignations from COVID-fatigue, have made the health care labor crisis worse. Add in increasing absences due to quarantine and illness, a reduction in foreign-educated nurses due to immigration limits, and highly-compensated “travel” RN positions, it’s not surprising that 16 percent of US hospitals had critical staffing shortages as of Oct 1. Staff shortages in healthcare are projected to reach 3.2 million by 2026.\n\nVaccine Mandates – Patient Benefits, Potential Staffing Challenges\n\nThe federal government has proposed a vaccine mandate requirement for Medicare and Medicaid participating healthcare providers that would cover more than 17 million healthcare workers.\n\nSome healthcare providers are concerned that this mandate could further fuel staffing shortages. While vaccine compliance rates have been high among healthcare workers, some executives fear that losing even a very small number of workers to mandates could have a significant impact.\n\nMany healthcare organizations, including the American Hospital Association (AHA), have advocated for vaccine mandates describing them as a “logical fulfillment of the ethical commitment of all healthcare workers to put patients as well as residents of long-term care facilities first.” Many large healthcare organizations, including Kaiser Permanente, have already implemented vaccine mandates and have retained over 99% of their staff. They have reported small numbers of employees lost to resignation or termination.\n\nThe AHA acknowledges that while vaccine mandates have many benefits, they could be difficult for smaller or more rural health systems that have limited sourcing options for nurses. Rural hospital executives concerned about having insufficient patient care staff have been reluctant to voluntarily implement mandates.\n\nProviders Need Innovative Staffing Solutions\n\nAs healthcare providers navigate the mandates, it’s clear they will need to be more resourceful and efficient in caring for patients. Even without mandates, staffing shortages will persist and any innovative solution that improves patient care with less staff should be considered. Some of these solutions may involve shifting the way care is delivered to appeal to a larger or different pool of clinical resources. For example, many nurses that have burned out on the hospital floor or in a physician practice, may be willing to consider returning to the field in a flexible, remote, part-time position.\n\nWhile it may be impractical for a physician’s office to hire and manage a part-time, remote nurse that only provides virtual care, they could outsource this function to a company that has a pool of remote nurses to serve exactly that function. This could allow a practice to dramatically expand the reach of their virtual care programs without adding to their current workload, or possibly even reducing the workload of in-office nurses.\n\nManaged RPM Can Help Alleviate Staffing Challenges\n\nRemote Patient Monitoring (RPM), a digital health solution that allows providers and their staff to monitor patients’ health from a distance, is a great place to start. Many RPM providers, including Optimize Health, offer managed RPM services where the RPM company provides outsourced nurses that act as an extension of your existing clinical staff team. This allows your practice to increase the direct clinical care time patients are receiving without directly hiring new staff, and may help reduce the number of routine patient calls your overworked nurses directly field on a daily basis.\n\nIf you are considering outsourcing or partnering with an RPM partner that provides nurses to assist with remote care services, what should you look for? We suggest conducting a virtual interview with your potential partner and ensuring the clinical staff not only demonstrates excellent clinical skills, but can effectively engage with patients in a virtual environment. Nurses working with patients in a virtual environment not only need to be comfortable with technology, they may need to be able to explain technology to patients as well. They also need a strong work ethic, an ability to work independently, and a passion for using motivational strategies to drive patient behavior changes.\n\nThe pandemic has fundamentally and permanently changed the way we deliver and receive services and healthcare is no exception. When implemented correctly, leveraging remote work and virtual care has the potential to both improve patient care and increase your staffing capacity.\n\nLearn More",

      "# [RPM and Obesity Weight Management on 2021-12-28](https://optimize.health/blog/rpm-obesity/)\nObesity is a complex chronic health condition that can lead to poorer mental health outcomes, reduced quality of life, and increased risk for diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and some types of cancer.\n\nOne-third of Americans have obesity. Costs for all of the facets of medical care for obesity total $147 billion.\n\nManagement of obesity can have a wide variety of options ranging from nutrition to physical activity to surgical interventions. 50-70 percent of adults with obesity have tried to lose weight and national guidelines recommend 10 percent weight loss, but even 5 percent has shown health benefits.\n\nRPM Makes it Easy for Patients\n\nLosing weight and maintaining weight loss is difficult. Connected RPM scales equip patients with support for adherence in checking their weights, visualizing trends with weight over time.\n\nRPM removes the friction of patient compliance with daily weigh-ins, recording these numbers, and bringing them to their provider to discuss their progress with weight loss. Furthermore, the integration of the weight trend data into the provider platform allows for the health system to engage and reach out to patients who might be deviating from their weight goals.\n\nRPM allows providers to check in with patients with the context of their weight loss and support them with a supportive educational curriculum surrounding nutrition and physical activity.\n\nClinical Studies Show Benefits of Digital Technology\n\nA study published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) concluded that “Weighing every day led to greater adoption of weight control behaviors and produced greater weight loss compared with weighing most days of the week. This further implicates daily weighing as an effective weight loss tool.”\n\nAdditionally, a randomized controlled trial measured the efficacy of a telemedicine-based weight loss program with video conference health coaching support. The study found that clinically significant weight loss was achieved in 69.2 percent in the intervention group versus 8 percent in the control group.\n\nLearn More About RPM",

      "# [RPM Onboarding Event for Patients on 2022-04-08](https://optimize.health/blog/onboarding-event/)\nWhat is a Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) onboarding event? An onboarding event involves dedicating staff time and rooms exclusively to RPM onboarding appointments for one or more days. This focus can enable you to ramp your RPM program quickly, allowing more patients to benefit from RPM immediately.\n\nWhy Have an Onboarding Event?\n\nWithout an onboarding event, many practices struggle to get RPM off the ground. They may add a few patients during their routine visits once they have RPM devices, but without the opportunity for the entire office team to work together to create RPM processes, it stalls.\n\nAn onboarding event is a great opportunity to partner with your RPM vendor to really learn how to make RPM successful in your practice. By carving out dedicated time for RPM, your team will quickly become very knowledgeable, learn what works well for your patients, and be comfortable carrying the processes you established forward.\n\nHow to Conduct an Onboarding Event\n\nBelow are the four key steps to planning and executing a successful RPM onboarding event.\n\nStep 1. Identify Potential RPM Patients\n\nThe patients you select will depend on the devices that you have chosen. It’s also important to think about your RPM goals and your practice’s patient population. For example, let’s say you are planning to monitor hypertensive patients with blood pressure devices. You should consider if you want to grow quickly and consider all patients with hypertension as RPM-eligible or prioritize those patients with the most need, such as patients with uncontrolled hypertension or patients that are non-compliant with their medication.\n\nInsurance coverage is also an important consideration. Medicare covers RPM but a patient without supplemental insurance may be responsible for copays. Many commercial insurers also cover RPM and your RPM provider should be able to provide an eligibility verification service.\n\nStep 2: Schedule RPM Appointments\n\nThe key to a successful onboarding event is getting a critical mass of patients onboarded to RPM in a short time frame. Depending on your practice, that could mean 20 patients or 50. This repetition of RPM onboarding in a single day means your team will have plenty of opportunities to practice talking to patients about RPM.\n\nTo achieve this, your staff (clinical or admin) must schedule at least one full day of appointments specifically for RPM onboarding. Your RPM partner should be able to provide a script that explains the benefits of RPM and includes answers to potential objections to facilitate scheduling.\n\nStep 3: Prepare for the Onboarding Event\n\nThe more setup that is completed in advance of the onboarding event, the smoother things will go. For example, collecting patient consent forms and RPM orders can avoid last-minute scrambles and delays while the patient is in the office.\n\nA crucial element of preparation is dedicating enough clinical staff for the onboarding event. We strongly recommend that your staff members conducting the onboarding event be 100% dedicated to RPM for the day(s) of the event.\n\nYour RPM customer success team should step-by-step coaching for your clinical staff before and during the onboarding event. Depending on the size of the onboarding event, they often attend the actual event at your clinic. They have seen what works and what doesn’t with patient onboarding and can provide guidance on setting up processes that will work for your practice.\n\nStep 4: Conduct RPM Appointments\n\nNow it’s time to conduct the actual onboarding appointment. This is the time to educate the patient about RPM and set expectations for their ongoing participation. When done well, the ongoing process sets the foundation for ongoing patient and engagement. Patients should leave the appointment feeling fully confident in how to use their device and understanding the expectations for regular readings and communication with your clinical staff.\n\nAfter conducting thousands of onboarding appointments, we are happy to share some practical, concrete, simple tips that can really make the difference between a good and great RPM experience for the patient.\n\nAfter Your Onboarding Event\n\nWhile the onboarding appointment is the time to set the patient up for success, it’s critical to keep the momentum going by starting monitoring outreach the very next day. If you are concerned that your staff does not have time to contact every RPM patient daily, consider managed RPM services that can act as an extension of your own clinical staff.\n\nWhile an onboarding event can give your program a quick ramp, it certainly isn’t the end of onboarding. Your practice is likely seeing many patients every day that can benefit from RPM. We recommend scanning upcoming appointments daily or weekly to identify potential RPM patients. Once those patients are flagged, an RPM onboarding can be added to their scheduled appointment.\n\nReady to Learn More?",
      "# [Remote Care Programs for Healthcare on 2023-11-24](https://optimize.health/who-we-serve/)\nPhysician practices\n\nA remote care program is attainable for small to mid-size practices because we’ve got you covered. Our remote patient monitoring software is easy to deploy and use. With our clinical monitoring services, your staff doesn’t have to take on more work. We can verify eligibility, onboard patients, deliver devices, monitor them with licensed nurses, and support billing needs.\n\nTracking patients with chronic diseases can make a difference in their health, with real-time information sent from devices to the platform. Chronic condition patients do see their physicians regularly. However, you don’t have visibility beyond the vitals you take at appointments and the patient’s symptoms update. Remote patient monitoring closes this gap with daily readings, which gives you more data to make the best treatment decisions. It supports continuity of care.\n\nValue-based care\n\nFor value-based care (VBC) organizations, remote patient monitoring is an essential tool to improve patient outcomes by linking reimbursement to the quality of care provided.\n\nRPM enables VBCs to provide quality care beyond exam rooms in several ways. It can play a key role in patient engagement and satisfaction improvements with regular contact between care providers and patients. Constant vitals monitoring delivers data to care teams, leading to better patient health, including lower blood pressure, weight loss, and more stable A1C numbers. It also maximizes clinical efficiency, allowing you to treat many patients remotely with the help of technology and clinical monitoring services.\n\nFQHCs\n\nFederally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) are part of the safety net for patient communities they may otherwise not have access to care. Your mission is to promote health and wellness to these populations, and remote care is an avenue to do this.\n\nRemote care programs offer great value for FQHCs and those they serve. Often, FQHCs have many chronic disease patients in their care. As a result, they need close monitoring of vitals and medication adherence. Beyond regular follow-up visits with physicians, FQHCs have little data that provides insights into the day-to-day management of their patients’ diseases.\n\nRPM can transform situations to deliver more connectedness and continuity of care. Such a program provides regular vital readings and regular communication between patients and care teams. Those interactions can be reminders to use their devices or take medications and answer patient questions. Additionally, if vitals become elevated, physicians get immediate notifications so they can intervene, which can reduce the need for emergency care and hospitalizations.\n\nHospitals and health systems\n\nA remote care program enables clinical outcome improvement at scale. No matter the size of your patient population, you can develop a plan that ensures equitable care, either with your staff or our team of licensed nurses.\n\nWith a program in place, it gives your health system a differentiator, enhancing patient engagement. Our remote patient monitoring platform is health system-ready, with tools to share data, track progress, and measure performance. Our solutions also support coding and billing.\n\nACOs\n\nAccountable Care Organizations (ACOs) can use RPM to better manage the most high-risk patients in their network. With the ability to monitor chronic conditions and take action immediately, the outcome is reduced hospitalizations and ED visits.\n\nA feature in our platform that ACOs attribute to the prevention of emergency care is the escalation framework. When critical readings occur, physicians can respond and intervene in the moment.\n\nThe healthcare data from the pool of patients empowers physicians in your group to have more insight into treatments and progression. They can then make proactive decisions more effectively.",

      "# [RPM Healthcare Christine Meyer Success on 2022-09-01](https://optimize.health/blog/christine-meyer-rpm/)\nChristine Meyer, MD and Associates, a 13-provider practice in the greater Philadelphia area, is committed to providing top quality, patient-centered care. Like many practices, they have a large number of patients with long-term chronic diseases, including hypertension and diabetes and are always looking for innovative ways to improve the care and quality of life for these patients.\n\nRPM is Good Medicine\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of treating patients with chronic diseases is managing their care between office visits. Before RPM, even when patients were taking their blood pressure at home, the providers at Christine Meyer, MD and Associates did not have access to the data.\n\nIn 2020, they launched remote patient monitoring (RPM) with Optimize Health to overcome this challenge. Their program has been extremely successful and now has over 450 patients. Lauren Marohn, the RPM lead, says, “RPM has allowed our patients to take control of their health, and they’re excited to see that their blood pressure or blood sugar is lower. RPM just allows us to deliver good medicine.”\n\nRPM as a Standard of Care\n\nChristine Meyer, MD and Associates have been so happy with the results that they now view RPM as a standard part of the care plan for their patients with hypertension and diabetes as well as those on weight loss programs.\n\nAll 13 of their providers are actively ordering RPM for patients. Providers engage with patients to set expectations for ongoing participation in RPM. They explain that RPM prevents hospitalizations, strokes, and other adverse events. Even when a patient’s readings are trending within range for a period of time, Christine Meyer, MD and Associates treats RPM as part of their permanent care plan. As Lauren reminds patients, “Hypertension is a silent killer.”\n\nDriving Patient Engagement with Optimize Health\n\nOnce patients are enrolled, Lauren uses the Optimize Health platform to prioritize her work each day. “The platform highlights which patients had critical readings so I know who needs help or to be called immediately. I can also view patients by conditions, last reading taken, or number of readings that month so I can see what to prioritize next.”\n\nA huge part of Christine Meyer’s success is Lauren’s trusted relationships with her patients. “I do a lot of patient outreach and I’ve become familiar with who needs more support. I had one patient whose blood pressure kept getting higher and higher, and so I immediately called her to come into the office, and we gave her meds, conducted a cardiac workup, and saved her from a hospitalization.”\n\nThe Future is Growth\n\nChristine Meyer’s plans for the program include focusing on ongoing engagement as well as growth. They want patients to truly understand how RPM prevents strokes and hospitalizations and can save lives.\n\nLauren’s goal is to continue to engage both providers and patients to grow the program. “I hope to someday have 900 patients enrolled in the program so that we keep delivering better care, and can save them from hospitalizations and unnecessary critical events.”\n\nReady to Be the Next RPM Success Story?",

      "# [Why Switch RPM Vendors and When To Do So on 2022-07-05](https://optimize.health/blog/switch-rpm-vendors/)\nRemote patient monitoring has evolved significantly since CMS first introduced the reimbursement codes in 2019. Patient awareness and interest in remote monitoring is growing. Clinical research has continued to demonstrate the effectiveness of RPM in improving outcomes for multiple conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, and heart failure. Congress has continued to invest in telehealth, expanding remote monitoring with the addition of remote therapeutic monitoring.\n\nYet, despite all this good news, many practices who understand the value of RPM are still struggling to make it work. They identified a significant number of patients that could benefit from RPM, but devices are sitting unused on shelfs. Many practices didn’t fully understand the staff time required for remote monitoring. Others lacked support from their RPM vendor to get the program launched successfully. And some find it difficult to get patients to engage and take their readings.\n\nIf your RPM program isn’t quite living up to your expectations, it may be time to reevaluate your RPM partner. RPM partners are no longer just about selecting the right software — it’s about a full solution of services that meet your needs now and in the future. We’ve identified three challenges that have led practices to start searching for a new remote patient monitoring solution as well as questions to ask potential new vendors.\n\nA Plan for Staffing\n\nThe most common challenge we see among practices struggling to maintain and grow their RPM programs is staffing. Most practices don’t have clinical staff with spare free time to invest in RPM. And many RPM vendors fail to adequately explain just how much staff is needed for both RPM onboarding and ongoing monitoring.\n\nThis is exactly why we always start with a success plan (before you sign a contract). The success plan outlines the roles, responsibilities, and time commitments of your staff who will make up your internal RPM team. It also covers your goals and guidance on how to measure progress against them.\n\nRemote patient monitoring software must be intuitive, easy to learn, and simple to use with minimal instruction so your team isn’t wasting time “figuring it out.” Many RPM vendors will offer software training, but software training is really just the starting point. A great RPM partner will teach your team how to optimize every part of the RPM journey including patient identification, consent, enrollment, monitoring, billing, support, etc.\n\nAnd if you don’t have enough resources to fulfill those functions, your RPM partner needs to provide a customized solution for your team. That could include creating a hiring plan for new staff or conducting the onboarding or monitoring with outsourced RPM services.\n\nClinical Expertise\n\nA great monitoring solution will use licensed nurses that have the expertise to assess patients with confidence and competence, which minimizes false escalations. But, they will collaborate with your team on treatment plans and escalation policies, so they feel like part of your own staff.\n\nLikewise, outsourced remote onboarding can reduce the burden on your staff by managing all the logistics of onboarding, including effective onboarding appointments.\n\nQuestions to Ask When Evaluating Your RPM Vendor\n\nHow much staff do I need for RPM now and in the future?\n\nHow much time is my staff spending using the software? Is it easy and intuitive?\n\nHow effective and comprehensive has our staff training been?\n\nDo you offer an outsourced monitoring service?\n\nWhat are the credentials of your outsourced staff?\n\nHow does your monitoring team create treatment plans and escalation policies?\n\nHow does your monitoring staff communicate with our team and maintain our approach to treating patients?\n\nDo you offer remote onboarding services?\n\nPatient Engagement\n\nLow patient adherence is the second-most common reason why RPM programs are unsuccessful. Beyond having enough staff to regularly communicate with patients, there are several other factors that impact patient engagement.\n\nDevices: Devices need to be easy to use from the perspective of your patient population. While Bluetooth apps may work for some patients, seniors often prefer cellular devices. Cellular devices are as simple to use as non-connected devices, so they will already be familiar to many patients. With a cellular blood pressure cuff, you press one button to take your reading and automatically transmit the data. With a cellular weight scale, you simply step on and step off — that’s it. Cellular devices also reduce potential financial barriers as patients do not need a smartphone, computer, or internet connection. A strong RPM partner should offer both cellular and Bluetooth options to meet the needs of your patient population.\n\nCommunication and reminders: To make it easier for your clinical staff to engage with patients, the best RPM software has built-in communication tools that allow them to text, call, and video chat with patients in one-click. The software should also have automated reminders about readings that can be configured to each patient’s schedule. This ensures the reminders are welcome and helpful, not annoying and intrusive.\n\nEffective onboarding: The onboarding appointment is a critical time to educate your patients about the importance of their participation and set expectations for their engagement. Your RPM partner should be supporting your team with an Onboarding Event that can not only jump start your program, but also teach your team how to conduct effective onboarding. Your RPM partner should also provide coaching on how to talk to patients about RPM and help you create onboarding processes that work for your practice.\n\nQuestions to Ask When Evaluating Your RPM Vendor\n\nHow many patients are taking the required 16 days of readings per month?\n\nDoes our staff find it easy to engage with patients in the software?\n\nAre we meeting our patient retention goals (and did our RPM vendor help us set them before we started)?\n\nDoes our RPM vendor offer both cellular and Bluetooth devices?\n\nHow often are patients reporting issues with their devices or connected technology?\n\nHow does our RPM vendor support the patient onboarding process?\n\nOverall, are our patients satisfied with RPM? Has it strengthened our provider-patient relationship?\n\nCan I do in-person onboarding myself and remote onboarding simultaneously?\n\nIf I’m using remote onboarding, how does my partner ensure remote onboarding appointments are as effective as in-person?\n\nClient Success and Supporting Services\n\nA strong RPM partner supports you and your patients at every step of their journey. Most companies offer customer service — reactively responding to questions and issues. But, does your RPM partner provide true client success? Are they regularly sharing data and best practices before problems arise? Are you having ongoing conversations about your goals and how to reach them?\n\nA strong client success team starts with a success plan, has dedicated implementation experts to help you launch effectively, and provides regular business reviews. They understand that RPM is just one of many services that you offer. And it may not always be your number one priority.\n\nAs your RPM program grows, you may need more support or different workflows. Your RPM partner should have a flexible solution that can adapt when your needs change. This ensures you can add services as you need them while controlling which parts of the RPM process you manage versus outsource.\n\nSupporting services that a strong RPM solution should offer (but not require that you use) include:\n\nOutsourcing monitoring\n\nOnsite and remote onboarding\n\nInsurance eligibility verification\n\nEHR integration\n\nQuestions to Ask When Evaluating Your RPM Vendor\n\nIs our RPM vendor proactively helping us grow and meet our goals?\n\nDo we even have established RPM goals?\n\nHow often do we evaluate data on key metrics, such as patient growth, patient adherence rates, and patient engagement?Can we easily access that data?\n\nDid our RPM vendor help us create effective onboarding processes? Are they still working today?\n\nDoes our RPM vendor offer other services that we may need now or in the future?\n\nDo they truly understand our needs and pain points to help us create a strong RPM program?\n\nIs it Time to Reevaluate your RPM Program?\n\nRemote patient monitoring can seem complex, but it doesn’t have to be. A great RPM partner can make monitoring easy, safe, effective, and profitable.\n\nIf your RPM program is struggling to grow or not living up to your expectations, set up a free consultation with one of RPM experts. We can seamlessly transition your existing RPM patients to our platform and design a plan for success for the rest of your patient population.\n\nRead Next\n\nOptimize Health + athenahealth: Providing Better Remote Care with Connected Data\n\nIn clinical environments, how you spend your time matters.

With the rapid increase in the adoption of telehealth and Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM), many studies are investigating if utilizing RPM to share patient blood glucose levels with clinicians can lead to lower A1C levels.\n\nResearch Supports the Role of Remote Patient Monitoring in Reducing A1C for Diabetic Patients\n\nRemote Patient Monitoring (RPM) provides instantaneous access to blood glucose data before and after patient meals and activities. This creates a complete feedback loop for collecting and analyzing data, adjusting behaviors, and modifying treatment to improve outcomes.\n\nRPM enables more data analysis, structured health coaching, and timely interventions that lead to better A1C management than patient self-monitoring. In addition to improving treatment outcomes in diabetic patients, studies have indicated RPM can boost prevention in pre-diabetic patients.\n\nWe understand that healthcare providers need to direct their limited resources to programs that have been clinically proven to positively impact patient outcomes. As such, we compiled and synthesized fifteen (15) studies that scientifically demonstrate how RPM can help diabetic and pre-diabetic patients.\n\nHighlights of the Research Include:\n\nConsistent Results with Optimize Health Outcomes\n\nOptimize Health’s clients using Remote Patient Monitoring to manage blood glucose have produced results consistent with the clinical research. Diabetic patients have experienced an average 4.5 drop in A1C within 4.5 months.\n\nHow to Use the RPM Diabetes Research\n\nPhysicians and ordering providers rely on the results of clinical research studies every day to make patient care decisions.

      "# [Tips on Talking to Patients About RPM on 2022-01-31](https://optimize.health/blog/talking-about-rpm/)\nThe number of patients interested in telehealth is skyrocketing. One study shows that 76 percent are interested in telehealth now compared to just 11 percent in 2019. And 74 percent of telehealth users report higher levels of satisfaction with their healthcare. That said, Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) is still a new concept for some patients. In fact, the patients that could likely benefit from RPM the most – older, less tech-savvy patients with multiple chronic conditions – may be the most resistant to new programs and technologies. So, how do you discuss with a hesitant patient, especially one that may be concerned about co-pays for RPM, that an RPM program may be beneficial for their care?\n\nTaking the Patients Point of View\n\nWhen discussing RPM with patients, you may be tempted to focus only on explaining the clinical research supporting remote monitoring. While the research is compelling, we also strongly recommend making it a point to keep the conversation as relevant to their everyday life and their specific health challenges as possible.\n\nThe more personalized the RPM discussion is, the more likely it is that a patient will understand the benefits and alternatives to participating in an RPM program and want to take next steps to actively participate in the program. Well-designed patient education materials can help guide live conversations about remote monitoring. However, once a provider determines that a patient is a good candidate for an RPM program, it’s important for the care team to make sure the patient completely understands the benefits and risks of the program so they can make an informed choice to say yes when it’s a good fit.\n\nWhat Should I Say to Patients?\n\nWe recommend trying to see the benefits of RPM through the patient’s eyes. Focus on how RPM may:\n\nImprove their health\n\nExample: High blood pressure can create complications like heart disease or stroke. Taking your blood pressure every day can help us adjust your medications and support you in making healthy lifestyle choices that may keep you out of the hospital and emergency room.\n\nAllow them to take control of their health\n\nExample: Using this device helps put you in charge of your own health. You don’t have to wait until your next office appointment to monitor your health. Daily readings help you and us manage your chronic condition more proactively. By better managing your symptoms, you may enjoy a better quality of life.\n\nProvide them with the comfort and convenience of daily clinical check-ins\n\nExample: If you worry about living by yourself with a chronic condition, RPM may help. A trained clinical care team member will be looking at your data and checking in on you daily or as needed to make sure you are feeling Ok. If you have family members that worry about you, this may provide comfort and reassurance to them as well.\n\nMake their life easier\n\nExample: If you have a chronic condition, such as hypertension and diabetes, you may already be taking regular readings. With RPM, you can stop writing down your readings on paper and trying to make sense of what to do if you have a high or low reading. A trained clinical care team member will be reviewing your data to help you and us make decisions about your care.\n\nHelp them financially\n\nExample: Whether it’s a visit to a hospital, admission to a nursing home, or even more prescription medication, if your condition worsens, it may be costly. Your device may save you money by helping to reduce the high costs of treating health problems versus preventing them.\n\nThe Patient Said Yes to RPM, Now What?\n\nIf the patient has agreed to participate, they will need an onboarding appointment. Education and setting expectations are key to successful onboarding. We want to make sure patients leave the onboarding appointment confident they know how to use their device. They also need to understand the importance of taking regular readings according to their clinical needs and plan of care and regular engagement with your care team.\n\nReady to Learn More?\n\nIf you have questions or want to learn more, please schedule a free consultation with one of our RPM experts. We are happy to share more details on the potential clinical and financial benefits of RPM. We also have additional resources on how to successfully onboard RPM patients.\n\nRead Next\n\nRPM, RTM, CCM, PCM – Which Remote Care Program is Right for Your Patients?\n\nThe pandemic didn’t create remote care, but it has greatly accelerated the adoption of telehealth and remote care.\n\nRead More",
      "# [RPM and CCM Are Perfect Complements on 2022-08-23](https://optimize.health/blog/using-rpm-ccm/)\nThe Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) introduced Chronic Care Management (CCM) in 2015 to reimburse providers for non-face-to-face services between office visits. The intent was to improve outcomes and reduce costs of caring for patients with chronic conditions with ongoing, remote care coordination. CCM is designed for patients that have two or more chronic conditions expected to last at least 12 months that put the patient at significant risk. 86% of Americans over the age of 65 have two or more chronic conditions, implying that most Medicare patients could be eligible for CCM.\n\nCCM Proven Effective\n\nCMS has demonstrated that care coordination is effective. Their claims analysis demonstrated that CCM:\n\nWith these results, it’s no surprise that CMS has increased reimbursement on several CCM CPT® codes, including a 55% increase for CPT code 99490, which reimburses the first 20 minutes of clinical staff time and a 29% increase for CPT code 99439, which covers additional 20 minute increments of clinical staff time.\n\nWhat Makes a Good CCM Program?\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Family Medicine (AAFP), a strong CCM program drives value by “delivering continuous, comprehensive, and connected health care.”\n\nThe value of remote care programs is engaging with your patients on a more regular basis between office visits. Medical Economics concludes that a CCM program combined with remote patient monitoring (RPM), behavioral health integration (BHI), and other services can “provide patients with timelier, more personalized, and highly efficient remote care.”\n\nIf a prevention plan is at the heart of a CCM program, what better way to ensure that prevention plan is working and up-to-date than with daily or regular vital sign monitoring? That’s exactly what RPM can do as a complement to your CCM program. RPM provides unique access to more patient data without putting the burden of manually tracking readings on the patients.\n\nHaving real-time access to trends in blood pressure, weight, blood sugar, or blood oxygenation can help inform a care team on how to manage chronic conditions.\n\nRPM + CCM Makes Clinical and Financial Sense\n\nNot only do RPM and CCM complement each other clinically, they also work together financially. Because each service has its own set of CPT® Codes, practices can bill for both services. However, they cannot count the same minutes of clinician time towards both services.\n\nIn addition, RPM does not require a specific diagnosis like CCM does, so there may be patients that are eligible for RPM that are not eligible for CCM.\n\nOvercoming Barriers to Remote Care\n\nWhile thousands of healthcare providers have incorporated remote care into their practice, many others have understandable concerns about the barriers to remote care adoption. Some are taking a more selective approach to remote care, even though patients want more options that provide quality and convenience.\n\nOf all the remote care options, remote monitoring can overcome many of the perceived barriers of telehealth.\n\nAre you Ready to Enhance your CCM Program?",
      "# [What Staff Do You Need for an RPM Program on 2022-02-09](https://optimize.health/blog/how-much-staff/)\nMost practices start Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) programs with the intent to provide proactive, preventative care. Monitoring patients between office visits enables timely interventions and educational opportunities that improve patient outcomes. This requires clinical staff time to monitor daily readings, engage with patients, and provide ongoing education which can be challenging in today’s world of staffing shortages.\n\nOne of the most frequent questions we get asked by practices considering RPM, is “How much time will this take my staff?” Likewise, we also see a lot of practices that could provide significant benefit to their patients with RPM opt not to because they don’t have the clinical staff. Fortunately, we can help you plan for clinical staffing and provide solutions if you feel like you don’t have enough clinical staff.\n\nHow Much Clinical Staff Do I Actually Need?\n\nYour RPM clinical monitoring staff should be prepared to engage with your RPM patients regularly, as determined by patient need and clinical protocols. Adding RPM responsibilities to your already stretched-thin clinical staff could lead to insufficient engagement.\n\nIn our experience, one full-time dedicated clinical staff member may be able to monitor between 150 – 200 patients, depending on the nature and complexity of the patients’ needs. Smaller RPM programs may choose to dedicate a partial FTE, but it’s critical that you allocate the right number of hours for RPM to meet the needs of your patients.\n\nA staffing calculator can be a very helpful tool in planning for RPM resources. Depending on the clinical needs of your patients, 150 patients per full-time care team member (CTM) is a good starting point to adjust up or down from. If your patient population is more acute or has more complicated conditions, you may need to assign fewer patients to each clinical staff member. The experience and credentials of your CTMs can also impact staffing your clinical monitoring team.\n\nSample RPM Clinical Staffing Estimates\n\nKeep in mind that 20 minutes of engagement time are required to bill for the 99457 CPT® code. Depending on patient acuity and treatment plans and goals, some patients may benefit from incremental segments of engagement time. In addition, 16-days of data transmission are required for the 99454 CPT® code.\n\nIn addition, regular interaction with patients may increase the number of patients taking regular readings. and therefore eligibility for the 99454 CPT® code for 16-days of data transmission.\n\nIt’s important to note that your RPM staffing needs will likely change over time as your program grows. If you are planning for growth, you should be ready to flex and increase your RPM resources.\n\nWhat if I Don’t Have that Much Clinical Staff Time?\n\nMany practices don’t have an extra clinical staff member with no or minimal responsibilities that they can easily allocate to RPM. Many practices will need to consider hiring additional clinical staff or outsourcing the monitoring to make RPM as successful as possible. The potential benefits of expanding your practice to include RPM often outweigh the investment in RPM clinical staffing expenses. Your RPM partner should help you conduct a simple Return on Investment analysis that will justify the expense of either option below.\n\nWhile it may feel like you are forfeiting some control with partner-managed clinical monitoring, a strong vendor will act as an extension of your own clinical staff. Outsourcing clinical monitoring has several potential key advantages:\n\nWith partner-managed clinical monitoring, your practice will still need to have the resources available to manage patient escalations and patient interventions, such as changes to medication and treatment plans. This also helps ensure your practice retains control of the patient’s overall health and progress towards their goals.\n\nMaking the Right Clinical Staffing Decision for Your Practice\n\nThe first step in determining which solution is right for you is using the RPM clinical staffing calculator to estimate the resources you need. Then, compare the projected clinical staffing needs to your team’s current workload and availability. With that information, you can weigh the complete pros and cons to self-managed versus partner-managed RPM programs.",
      "# [RPM Healthcare Christine Meyer Success on 2022-09-01](https://optimize.health/blog/christine-meyer-rpm/)\nChristine Meyer, MD and Associates, a 13-provider practice in the greater Philadelphia area, is committed to providing top quality, patient-centered care. Like many practices, they have a large number of patients with long-term chronic diseases, including hypertension and diabetes and are always looking for innovative ways to improve the care and quality of life for these patients.\n\nRPM is Good Medicine\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of treating patients with chronic diseases is managing their care between office visits. Before RPM, even when patients were taking their blood pressure at home, the providers at Christine Meyer, MD and Associates did not have access to the data.\n\nIn 2020, they launched remote patient monitoring (RPM) with Optimize Health to overcome this challenge. Their program has been extremely successful and now has over 450 patients. Lauren Marohn, the RPM lead, says, “RPM has allowed our patients to take control of their health, and they’re excited to see that their blood pressure or blood sugar is lower. RPM just allows us to deliver good medicine.”\n\nRPM as a Standard of Care\n\nChristine Meyer, MD and Associates have been so happy with the results that they now view RPM as a standard part of the care plan for their patients with hypertension and diabetes as well as those on weight loss programs.\n\nAll 13 of their providers are actively ordering RPM for patients. Providers engage with patients to set expectations for ongoing participation in RPM. They explain that RPM prevents hospitalizations, strokes, and other adverse events. Even when a patient’s readings are trending within range for a period of time, Christine Meyer, MD and Associates treats RPM as part of their permanent care plan. As Lauren reminds patients, “Hypertension is a silent killer.”\n\nDriving Patient Engagement with Optimize Health\n\nOnce patients are enrolled, Lauren uses the Optimize Health platform to prioritize her work each day. “The platform highlights which patients had critical readings so I know who needs help or to be called immediately. I can also view patients by conditions, last reading taken, or number of readings that month so I can see what to prioritize next.”\n\nA huge part of Christine Meyer’s success is Lauren’s trusted relationships with her patients. “I do a lot of patient outreach and I’ve become familiar with who needs more support. I had one patient whose blood pressure kept getting higher and higher, and so I immediately called her to come into the office, and we gave her meds, conducted a cardiac workup, and saved her from a hospitalization.”\n\nThe Future is Growth\n\nChristine Meyer’s plans for the program include focusing on ongoing engagement as well as growth. They want patients to truly understand how RPM prevents strokes and hospitalizations and can save lives.\n\nLauren’s goal is to continue to engage both providers and patients to grow the program. “I hope to someday have 900 patients enrolled in the program so that we keep delivering better care, and can save them from hospitalizations and unnecessary critical events.”\n\nReady to Be the Next RPM Success Story?",

So now that the money is taken care of, I want to know what’re the best ways to spend it to optimize health.  I’m thinking of 10x Health with Gary Brecka…what he did with Dana White is amazing.  Has anyone here used them?  What else is out there?  Tell me about your experiences.\n\n## Comment ID kaqx4j5 with +275 score by [(kindaretiredguy, Reddit, 2023-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/183srcl/who_do_you_work_with_to_optimize_your_health/kaqx4j5/) (in reply to ID 183srcl):\nI come from this space (started and sold a nutrition coaching company that provided simple advice). Gary is a known charlatan and is looked down on by most of the evidence based people. All you need is advice like in Attia’s book at this point. So many people with money are being duped by these biohackers pushing non sense. \n\nHere’s my advice that I would give to everyone. Step one is not to be overweight (tons of health issues come from it), workout (lift and do cardio), eat decently (various foods with nutrients and not stressing too much about the things you enjoy- with one caveat. You must be able to moderate the fun stuff, and it should not be preventing weight loss or causing weight gain), reduce stress, have a community. \n\nYou absolutely do not need to overspend for this advice. What you might want to spent on is sticking to that advice via accountability, but any decent trainer or rd/nutritionist should be able to provide that.\n\n### Comment ID kastruq with +105 score by [(Activate_The_Robots, Reddit, 2023-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/183srcl/who_do_you_work_with_to_optimize_your_health/kastruq/) (in reply to ID kaqx4j5):\nThe number of posts in this subreddit asking how to buy or secret-hack their health is astonishing.\n\n**The answer, always:** lose weight, be more active, get good sleep, stop eating double-cheeseburgers for breakfast, reduce your stress and spend more time with your family. \n\n**The response, always:** Yeah, but I have *money*.\n\n🤦🏼‍♂️\n\n#### Comment ID katwapw with +14 score by [(kindaretiredguy, Reddit, 2023-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/183srcl/who_do_you_work_with_to_optimize_your_health/katwapw/) (in reply to ID kastruq):\nRight?

No amount of money can force you to do it… it makes it easier but it won’t fix it if you don’t do the work yourself. A few things I’ve found that helps:\n\n- Stop eating crappy food. I’m not saying you need to buy all organic but if you’re buying a sandwich default to a place that makes great bread vs a subway. \n\n- Make moving around a consistent part of your life. I HATE driving. I take public transit or bike my kids everywhere. If you live someplace where cars are the mandatory way to get around then move (this is fatFIRE). The act of walking is going to help a ton vs a sedentary life style.\n\n- Take up a hobby that is a physical activity. I started playing tennis a few years ago and the results are noticeable. Before that it was rock climbing. I also ski. If all of this is beyond your abilities get a trainer and commit (no amount of money will force you).\n\n- You don’t need to take alcohol to zero but limit to a few days a week in moderate amounts. If you over do it every other month that’s fine. If you’re drinking a dozen miller lites on a Saturday on your boat then why are you even posting this question?\n\nStop falling for easy fixes by throwing money at it and fix your life.\n\nEdit: The comment about driving doesn’t apply to everyone. There are plenty of people in shape that live in areas where driving is a necessity. They focus on moving/being active in other ways. If you can’t do that for yourself this is a fix.\n\n### Comment ID katqyh3 with +8 score by [(fsapds, Reddit, 2023-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/183srcl/who_do_you_work_with_to_optimize_your_health/katqyh3/) (in reply to ID kaqx4j5):\nSleep, sir, you forgot sleep\n\n#### Comment ID katw4l4 with +6 score by [(kindaretiredguy, Reddit, 2023-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/183srcl/who_do_you_work_with_to_optimize_your_health/katw4l4/) (in reply to ID katqyh3):\nI feel like an idiot because that’s so obvious and what I talk about with people lol.\n\n### Comment ID kasvq7w with +3 score by [(LifeLongLearnr, Reddit, 2023-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/183srcl/who_do_you_work_with_to_optimize_your_health/kasvq7w/) (in reply to ID kaqx4j5):\nI am bookmarking this.\n\n### Comment ID kavd4fb with +2 score by [(JLHtard, Reddit, 2023-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/183srcl/who_do_you_work_with_to_optimize_your_health/kavd4fb/) (in reply to ID kaqx4j5):\nWhat I found what worked for me: 80% of the time healthy lifestyle (at least 5 out of 7 days moving your body decently) + the same for eating and drinking.

She had been partially raised along with the Pygmies they were documenting. \n\nI asked her, \"What do the Pygmies do when their babies wake up at night?\"\n\nShe replied, \"They don't sleep through the night like we do.

I am very knowledge when it comes to health and sports because I enjoy it, not because I make a living of it. So I try to give advice. What I do: \n\n\nI do biyearly check ups at my doctor getting my blood work done, gynecology, … \n\nAlso dentist every 3 months for a check up, I think dental care is very important! \n\nI do also visit my physical therapist once a week to identify some weak points in my muscle system. This is very important for your posture and health especially when getting older! The weight your muscles carry doesn’t need to be carried completely by your spine, joints,.. \n\nEspecially as I love wearing heels on a daily basis(which is unhealthy) I focus on trying to have my muscles be ready to take the extra impact. \n\nOther than that just work out regularly, doesn’t need to be anything specific dedicated to health, consistency is KEY, so it has to be something you enjoy! (That is VERY important) working out for a year is good, but doing it for decades in a healthy amount is what you are really looking for. \n\nWhen it comes to food it also depends on what you can do so you enjoy it enough to stay consistent right? A 60% healthy diet over a lifespan is better than eating 100% for 3 years and then get tired and just be at 0% for the next 40 years. \n\nI just try to stay away from processed food, sugar, sweets. I try to roughly keep my macros under control (talking about approximately 1,5g fat/kg bodyweight, 2g protein/kg bodyweight and the rest carbohydrates) I have our household lady stick to these values and track my food when she cooks for me and just use organic food. \n\nIf I am eating out I just eat what I want, because as I said I want it to be as comfortable and easy to maintain to do it over my lifespan. \n\nThings like not just sleeping 3 hours a night, smoking and drinking lots of alcohol are just things you have to think about. Of course they are unhealthy. I know I repeat myself, but to consistent once again. \nBetter drink a glas of wine when going out, instead of trying to do a 0 alcohol policy but carving for it and have wild outbursts every few years. If you are not prone for it some people do a 0 alcohol policy without any problems at all, so that’s individual \n\nI think if you do all that you a perfectly fine with what you can do, the rest is not to be influenced.\n\n## Comment ID kaquph1 with +35 score by [(ShitPostGuy, Reddit, 2023-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/183srcl/who_do_you_work_with_to_optimize_your_health/kaquph1/) (in reply to ID 183srcl):\nIn my experience, there is always someone willing to add on flashing lights and wooshing noises to every basic service and charge you 100x the price for it.

I’ve been a bit obsessed with the topic, especially since retiring in my mid 30s with a lot of time. \n\nBasically mastering the basics (mental, exercise, food) is most of it - even though it’s human nature to look externally for other people/programs etc to make it perfect. Educating yourself on general health is important. But really 90% of it is in your control and comes down to eating healthfully and as close to whole natural foods as possible with a lot of variety, exercise regularly, move your body in different ways frequently, stretch, limit alcohol, don’t smoke, limit stress, have purpose/community …… that is all in your control (and what I spend a good chunk of change on annually) and will get you very, very far.\n\nBeyond that there are smaller things you can do like concierge doctor (I chose against this), full body annual MRI cancer scans (also chose against this), regular vit b shots etc (I do sometimes but get most of what I need from diverse diet), or something like the GRAIL test that’s a simple blood test screening for 50+ cancers (I do it annually simply bc it’s low barrier/very simple with just a blood draw but understand it’s not fully accurate and also get the regular annual screenings).\n\nDepends on where you’re starting with your health journey. When I became interested in how to use my wealth to optimize longevity, I was already in a good spot (regular exercise, ate healthy, etc), so I made some tweaks here and there and am always reading/listening for new ideas and actual research. I’m generally interested in food science so it’s a hobby I’d say more than something that rules my world. If you’re at the very start of your health journey, sure… get a fancy trainer, nutritionist and outsource someone making your food/teaching you. I spend 5-7 hrs every Sunday food prepping all meals/snacks for the week and I honestly feel it’s added many years to my life/how I feel. Take the choice out. \n\nBooks like Peter Attia’s Outlive (there are many similar) are great. He gets very sciency/technical because he’s a total geek on the topic but I enjoy listening to him while I cook. \n\nI finally realized the excess stress I had trying to “perfect” longevity when I’d gotten myself 90%+ there with good choices was probably only going to deduct years from my life so I’ve settled into my routine and stopped looking for major optimizations proactively (like I said - I’m always reading/listening as it’s a hobby but I don’t stress on it).\n\nHope there was something valuable in there. But godddamn do I want to live a long time healthfully so I can hike mountains with my kids (who I had later in life as I was focused on wealth accumulation).

I’ve recently been focused on this part of my journey after “sprinting” non-stop in career hero mode for 10+ years.  I’m now 44/M for reference.\n\n1.  Get your data.  How on earth are you going to measure progress unless you have your data benchmarked when you start.  This is a full blood panel, it will cost you a grand.  Just do it.\n\n2.  Get a concierge doctor.  If you are a male and you live in the US, you are very likely NOT doing any kind of regular medical check-up / physical?  Why?  Because our healthcare system sucks and you have to sit in a waiting room with SICK people while you wait for some grumpy receptionist to call your name even though you showed up on time / early just for a doc to spend 4-5 minutes with you.  My concierge physician spends an hour at a time with me, we sit down in her office and talk to one another like any other professionals would.  I have learned so much.\n\n3.  Your concierge doctor will refer you to the best specialists.  She referred me to get a Calcium CT scan which is the number one predictor of cardiac arrest.  Score of 0-400 and lower is better.  She did this out of an abundance of caution when I told her about Sheryl Sandberg’s husband who was around my age and dropped dead on a treadmill in Hawaii.  I was worried.  The test was less than $200 and I’m all good to go as hard as I want.\n\n4.  I go to a high end men’s performance clinic and get the following: Testosterone, HCG, Mounjaro and an anti-estrogen.  They also prescribed a very low dose of cialis to use as a pre workout to enable better blood flow to my muscles.  Who knew?\n\n5.  I use another doctor for a Vyvanse prescription to combat binge eating.\n\n6.  I sleep like an absolute baby because my spouse has gone all out with our bed and bedding.  I think we have six functional pillows on the bed and we use all of them every night.  Down comforter, high thread count sheets and a really nice, firm mattress.  The bed itself is high quality and uhhhhh… sturdy.\n\n7.  I’ve hired two personal trainers, one is the secondary conditioning coach for many of the NFL players in my city.  He’s a good dude but sometimes pushes me a bit too hard and I was out with a tweaked back for a week.  I’m 44 not 24 bro!\n\nThe other personal trainer is a female pro bodybuilder, she knows how to sculpt and shape.\n\n8.  I have 200g of chicken breasts prepped for consumption every day (this is like four large chicken breasts), I also drink Koia shakes.  Sooooo gooooooooood (and non dairy.)\n\n9.  Lots of water.  Like try for two gallons.  Our city is above an aquifer and we have wonderful water right out of the tap, we just filter it with our refrigerator door filter / dispenser whatever.  This is definitely a struggle to get in.  Honestly I fail most days here.\n\n10.  This is the most important, your reference group.  If you hang out with overweight / obese people you will be obese.  Same with fit people.\n\nMy son is a famous entertainer that lives and works in Beverly Hills.  He is trained by the guy that the studios use to build actors into superheroes.  He motivated my change and is kind to me when I stumble.  He’s a year into it and has made amazingly impressive progress.\n\nHe put me on his supplement stack.  If there’s interest I can post it here.\n\nMy best friend and his son are also on the fitness journey now.  So, build this journey into the hearts and minds of your reference group and it will be automagic.\n\nGood luck!\n\n### Comment ID kavfhs4 with +1 score by [(DougyTwoScoops, Reddit, 2023-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/183srcl/who_do_you_work_with_to_optimize_your_health/kavfhs4/) (in reply to ID kau21tp):\nI’m interested in your supplement stack.

Mental fitness, or mental wealth, well-being and fulfilment, philosophical refinement, conduct and character, habits, purpose: that’s a different realm and very few people deal with it expertly. Look up performance psychiatry and positive psychology. It’s something I do as it happens- at least, I used to do but I’m FIREd and do mostly voluntary work and writing these days.

      "# Post ID x922ci: Longevity, Health Optimization, and Maintaining/ Improving Quality of Life in Youth & Aging with +221 score by [(santacruz_steve, Reddit, 2022-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/)\nAsking on behalf of parents (72M & 69F), but also for personal interest after watching my aunt go through one of the worst medical outcomes possible. What are the specific FATfire means you take to optimize your longevity and quality of life? I will start it off with things that range from common sense to things that work for me. However, those are primarily budget-friendly so I want to hear your Fatfire suggestions- things like longevity clinics that focus on preventive medicine through regular screenings and advising on how to optimize health through diet, supplementation, lifestyle and risk factors. Im into things like the Huberman Podcast,\n\nCommon-Sense Stuff:\n\n\\-Exercise... basically as much as possible as far as I can tell cardio + strength training. If exercise is a huge chore for you do what you enjoy and what you can and don't beat yourself up about it. What is the fatfire approach to this during aging?\n\n\\-Diet: Whole non-processed foods, fruits veggies and not industrially produced meats. lots of leafy greens, not a lot of carbs especially the processed bullshit in the states, avoid sugar, avoid processed seed oils, have a caloric restriction for yourself, and stick to it, especially at specific times.\n\n\\-Fasting: Seems to be pretty important with the principal rule is don't always be eating\n\n\\-Have a strong social circle. A super underrated one that probably alludes people. Seek people through common interests and shared values. Community breeds purpose.\n\n\\-Purpose: Purpose breeds positive emotions\n\n\\-Mental health\n\n\\-Sleep optimization: How do fatfire folks optimize their sleep? I have terrible insomnia but understand the importance of sleep. Some common sense sleep approaches: avoid blue light at night, exercise, cool bedroom, breathe through your nose during rest and at all times, have a very dark sleeping area that is cool, Huberman's light exposure circadian stuff- aka get outside in the AM upon waking, as much as possible during the day, and at sunset. So basically go outside.\n\n\\-Outdoor Exposure: Is proven to improve health outcomes and gratitude.\n\n\\-Gratitude: Apparantly literally changes your brain like meditation.\n\n\\-Meditation: Expands your mind like breathing exercises\n\n\\-Breathing exercises: These have really worked for me and seem to be increasing in popularity. There seem to be two kinds IMHO uppers and downers. Exercises to upregulate your nervouse system and exercise to downregulate- use them respectively to get more awake and in your body and alert or to calm and relax and less alert.\n\n\\-Cold & Heat Exposure: I love both cold exposure and sauna and firmly believe in the associated health and wellness benefits. I consider them positive stressors- health optimization isn't about minimizing stressors. In fact, humans are considered anti-fragile whereby the system becomes more resilient in response to stress. However, chronic stress of a negative and environmental kind must be avoided at all costs- they will ruin you and destroy your health and well-being. Interestingly, an apparent key factor in how to determine if a stressor is positive or negative is your mindset. When I get into cold water I tell myself that it's for my own well-being and therefore it is, and even the though first part always sucks I wouldn't trade it for anything, and the endorphin rush after and during is amazing.\n\n\\-Positive Stressor Maximaztion & Negative/ Chronic Stress Minimization: Find some positive stressors that you can leverage \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome Random Things Not To Do Before We Get Into FatFire Ideas:\n\n\\-Smoke tobacco\n\n\\-Drink in Excess\n\n\\-Be Overweight\n\n\\-Use motor vehicles with extreme caution and never drive drunk\n\n\\-Use hard drugs\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFatfire?\n\n\\-Executive physicals (?)\n\n\\-Screenings for common diseases (could people specify exactly what these would be?)\n\n\\-Genetic Testing (what specifically should one be aware of in this space? Are services like 23andme etc good enough or no? If not, what would you recommend)\n\n\\-Dentist, dermatologist, regular physicals\n\n\\-Wearables (do these things actually help at this point are apple watch, oura ring, ect there yet?)\n\n\\-Regular blood testing(does anyone have experience with services like insidetrtacker or a suggestion in this area?)\n\n\\-Supplementation: I don't really even know where to start with this one, especially for people who are aging... I take an occasional multi-vitamin and but never know if it's \n\n\\-Healthy Hobbies & Passions: Things that you enjoy doing and optimize health and ideally are outdoors are just a win win win- share you fatfire hobbies that keep you fit, healthy, and excited to go outside.\n\n## Comment ID innnsl4 with +157 score by [(Romanticon, Reddit, 2022-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/innnsl4/) (in reply to ID x922ci):\nAs someone who is HENRY and in the biotech space, with a background (PhD) in this sort of stuff, I think you have a ton of great items listed here.  My thoughts:\n\n**The good:**\n\n1. Diet.  Single biggest driver of health.  FatFIRE add-on: private chef or meal prep service if you're not interested in cooking or don't want to put in the time to ensure that meals (and portion sizes!) are healthy.\n2. Exercise.  Close behind diet as the single biggest driver of health.  FatFIRE add-on: home gym and/or personal trainer to help ensure that it becomes a very regular habit and make sure that all major muscle groups are targeted.\n3. Mental aspects (social circle, meditating, calmness, good attitude): all important.  FatFIRE add-on: you can definitely help ensure that there's adequate bonding time by offering to foot the bill for some vacations/retreats, although you'll have to be careful to not do this to the point where others are taking advantage of your generosity.\n4. Sleep.  Perhaps something that a lot of FatFIRE people miss out on, since we're often driving hard for that bottom line.  FatFIRE add-ons: creating a bedroom that is sealed off from outside light, alarm clocks that wake you more slowly and naturally, investing in a high quality mattress, and making sure to structure your day to ensure that sleep is prioritized (for people with newborns, for example, a night nurse can help preserve sleep).\n5. Avoiding the negative health impacts you listed (smoking, drinking, carrying extra weight, drugs, risk-taking endeavors).  Ideally, if you are focused on health, you'd cut out drinking entirely.  There is no healthy level of alcohol.  (But we all must balance health with enjoyment!)\n6. Regular medical visits.  This is less for the doctor's check-up and more for the bloodwork/screenings.  It's good to have regular measurements of blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, teeth X-rays, and other health measurements.\n\n**The stuff that probably isn't worth it:**\n\n1. Fasting.  Fasting is still being researched, and while intermittent fasting does show benefits, I've seen the \"tech bros\" take it to extremes with full-day or multi-day fasts.  These can be dangerous and don't seem to offer any increased health benefits over shorter intervals.  Likely, many of the benefits of longer fasts are due to the reduction in caloric intake, rather than the fast itself.  I'd caution anyone against fasting regularly for longer than 12 hours, and against ever doing more than 24 hours at a time.\n2. Supplementation.  Supplements are the poor man's healthy diet.  Most supplements are unregulated, their claims unproven (and they can claim just about anything as long as they don't state that it *cures a disease*, as the FDA doesn't care), and their contents suspect.  Megadoses range from useless to actively dangerous/deadly.  Someone in FatFIRE can eat a far healthier diet than the average person, and has even less of a need of supplements.\n3. Probiotics.  This is actually my research background, and I can tell you that pretty much every commercial probiotic on the market is shit (no pun intended).  I could write a whole post on their issues.  Again, a healthy diet is a far better move than wasting time looking at probiotics.\n\n**Situationally useful:**\n\n1. Genetic testing.  Get a screening if you're going to be having children or if you would rather be forewarned about some genetic diseases (think Parkinson's Disease).  Keep in mind that most SNPs (single mutations) have a *very small* effect on health outcomes.  If you have a 3x risk of cancer but the average population incidence is only 0.1%, you still only have a 0.3% chance of developing that cancer.\n2. Wearables.  Great if you love data, but you still have to do the actual exercise.  They don't make the actual work any easier.\n3. Blood testing.  Only useful if you are monitoring a specific condition, in my opinion.  Otherwise, get it checked annually at your physical.\n4. Executive physicals/concierge medicine: depends on your wealth and if you want that personal touch.  They won't find diseases earlier, but they can be much better to work with if you are actively monitoring/treating a condition or if you have familial history of some disease.\n\n**Others not mentioned that I care about:**\n\n1. Pollution and microplastics exposure.  We don't know all the details of microplastic ingestion, but it's probably not great.  Limiting the plastic you eat from is one step, but the biggest steps you can take are to avoid synthetic fibers and to stay away from roads (one of the single largest sources of microplastics is tire dust).  \n2. Monitoring activity throughout the day.  Even if you spend an hour in the gym, spending the other 23 sedentary (like at a desk job, even if it's a really fancy desk) is not ideal.  \n3. Skincare!  Even just sunscreen + nightly cleanser + moisturizer is far better than what most men do.  Sunscreen is cheap but incredibly important for fighting both the appearance of aging and skin cancer.\n4. Water.  Don't drink sugary drinks, drink water.  \n\nI think that folks in FatFIRE love the idea of finding that secret trick that costs too much for most to afford, but the truth is that almost all of us would benefit more from improving the basics than trying the extremes.  Even the wealthy can have poor diets, carry excess weight, fail to exercise.\n\n### Comment ID innovdg with +17 score by [(santacruz_steve, Reddit, 2022-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/innovdg/) (in reply to ID innnsl4):\nEPIC answer TY!\n\n### Comment ID inq0ar0 with +15 score by [(dmacerz, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inq0ar0/) (in reply to ID innnsl4):\nFasting has a range of benefits from reducing calorie intake, stabilising blood sugars, giving the liver a break so it can regenerate, improving insulin and pre diabetes issues, resetting hormones. Arguably the single most important of all of them. \n\nProbiotics - some products sucks but what’s your take on kefir and live yoghurts? What about polyphenol supplements and prebiotic fibres like psyllium husk?

Regular intermittent fasting is a cornerstone in my life and 3 day fasts a couple times a year have had tremendous health benefits for me. They are not fun and definitely need to be done with caution. I.e. making sure your sodium, potassium and magnesium supplementation is on point - look up \"snake juice\" on Google for a DIY concoction.\n\n#### Comment ID inr7lot with +5 score by [(Romanticon, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inr7lot/) (in reply to ID inq0ar0):\nI agree on the benefits of fasting - but most of these benefits are also seen from intermittent fasting, and it's not been fully separated out how many of them are due to the act of fasting itself, or if they're due to reduction in caloric intake and better mindfulness of diet.  Fasting definitely plays some benefit, but it's likely a part of a larger whole.\n\nLess studied are the longer fasts, like fasting 23 hours per day or people who do extended \"water fasts\".  These can become very dangerous and seem unnecessary, when most benefits could be obtained from just doing regular intraday fasting.\n\nI'm glad to see others are aware of prebiotics!  I'm doubtful on yogurt/kefir, but very enthusiastic about encouraging greater intake of prebiotics.\n\nMy main argument against yogurts is that, while they do contain tons of live microbes, those are microbes evolved and ideally suited to live in cold, lactose-filled, oxygen-rich yogurt.  Your gut is none of those things.  There was a bunch of excitement early on because both yogurt cultures and gut microbiomes contain *Lactobacillus*, but that's a broad genus of bacteria and the individual species differ significantly in gut vs. yogurt.\n\nPrebiotics, for anyone else reading this who isn't familiar, are foods that don't provide direct nutritional benefit to us, but do act as a food source for our gut microbiome.  /u/dmacerz mentioned polyphenols and psyllium husk, but there are plenty of other prebiotics - they're usually labeled on nutrition facts as \"dietary fiber.\" Most are in the form of complex starches that aren't easily broken down by our own digestive enzymes, but can be eaten by our gut microbes.  The big payoff is that, when microbes are feasting on prebiotics, they eat less of the mucus lining of our intestinal tract, reducing chances of inflammation if they eat all the way through to the intestinal wall.\n\nPrebiotics are great, and we should be eating more of them.  This could be a supplement, but - again, as I discussed in my parent comment - a better method is to improve diet.  There are tons of foods with lots of fiber, mainly vegetables, and most modern people simply don't eat enough of them.  You could certainly supplement your diet with prebiotic fiber (pretty much anything with resistant starch and fiber is decent; some people just have potato starch), but you could also focus on naturally upping your fiber and resistant starch intake in the foods you eat.\n\n### Comment ID inppcpb with +10 score by [(CupResponsible797, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inppcpb/) (in reply to ID innnsl4):\nSome supplements like creatine are indisputably “worth it”.\n\n### Comment ID inxp2pu with +2 score by [(blablooblan, Reddit, 2022-09-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inxp2pu/) (in reply to ID innnsl4):\nAny skin care brand recs for men?\n\n#### Comment ID inxvodl with +3 score by [(Romanticon, Reddit, 2022-09-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inxvodl/) (in reply to ID inxp2pu):\nI personally like NIVEA's moisturizer that also has SPF 15, because I'm lazy and don't want to bother with multiple creams if I can help it...\n\n...but I'm no shill, and I think more importantly, it depends on your skin type.  I've got oily skin so I try to look for moisturizers that won't add to that, but someone with dry skin will probably have different preferences.\n\nThere are some really nice skincare routines out there, but I just can't muster up the effort right now to dive really deep into them.

It doesn't have to be a Peloton but the cardio/endurance exercise is outstanding.\n\nAlso, prioritize sleep.  Treat sleep apnea if you have it.

You “dive” in a pressurized hard shell chamber while breathing pure oxygen. The combination of pressure and oxygen gets far more oxygen into the cells than is possible any other way. The therapy has been used in mainstream medicine for many years to accelerate various types of wound healing, but is just now being explored for anti-aging applications. \n\nIn a 2018 study, 60 HBOT sessions increased telomere length by nearly 40% while reducing markers of cellular senescence. Link to study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33206062/\n\nI recently did ten sessions while on sabbatical to address some lingering long COVID issues and it felt like a total reset for my brain. It’s hard to express how rejuvenated I felt by about the sixth session. I also regained a meaningful degree of smell that had been almost completely lost for two years (from the OG Alpha strain). Subjectively speaking, it’s by far the most powerful complimentary treatment I’ve encountered, bar none. My husband also did three sessions following a major surgery and his surgeon was stunned (his words) by how fast he was healing  at his one week post-op. \n\nA 10 session package (90min @2.2 atmospheres) in Austin runs $2K, and a 60-session package is $10k. \n\nNot sure if this is the sort of thing you’re looking for, but I’ve been so impressed by it that I had to chime in.\n\n### Comment ID intb6v9 with +3 score by [(santacruz_steve, Reddit, 2022-09-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/intb6v9/) (in reply to ID inq2eis):\nWell, I am a technical scuba diver so maybe I get this anyways :).\n\n### Comment ID ipeivlh with +1 score by [(alexanderleedmd13, Reddit, 2022-09-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/ipeivlh/) (in reply to ID inq2eis):\nDid you stop at 10 sessions?

As you know, the most impactful things we can do are related to good diet, exercise, sleep, and stress-control habits.. Once those things are in place, the more speculative interventions will likely have very small to zero incremental impact. All those supplements that look good in various studies don't add much if you have already optimized your diet with real food (especially fruit and veg). Definitely get an annual checkup, but running every test out there will have very modest additional benefit while significantly increasing the risk of overtreatment.\n\nAdvanced exercise interventions like low oxygen training (or high oxygen training or EWOT machines)? Remote ischemic conditioning? Yeah, I've tried them but honestly couldn't really tell you whether they are doing anything besides a placebo effect. I've even looked into hyperbaric oxygen treatments; again jury is still very much out. Perhaps in the future there will be magic bullets, but currently most of this is more hype than proven interventions.\n\nFinal point is that I think most people look for magic bullets, while avoiding the harder and vastly more evidence based lifestyle modifications.

Basically any chemical type names, non-actual food things. Try finding a solid farmer who raises free-range, high quality of life animals. Not only is it delicious, but you can feel and taste the difference. This obviously excludes restaurants, but a considerable amount actually knew and took pride in where they sourced their meat.  Worth asking and filtering that way.\n\nMaintain proper excretion/digestion. Walking does this—the impact of gravity gets it moving—proper portions and not filling your stomach often does as well. \n\nWhen doing a physical-spiritual practice, have in mind the psychobody. Practicing yoga or Qi Gong (or prayer in some traditions) can allow you access to your body in a way that you gain greater awareness of parts previously unknown. Not only does this translate to moving differently after discovering new muscles/movements you were unaware of, it leads to new neural connections so that you can process reality differently. Emotions are physically stored through different chemical markers in cells, and there’s been personality links to certain diseases and physical pathologies of the body. Cultivating a connection, compassion, and acceptance for things you might have had to store away long ago can maximize outcomes for health as well as a greater depth of life and knowledge of oneself as they got to this point. Increases QOL bc of increased relational ability with oneself and others. \n\nMartial arts study has an echo effect on life as well—not necessary but has changed lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID inlt2vx with +1 score by [(Asguardian26, Reddit, 2022-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inlt2vx/) (in reply to ID x922ci):\nRemindme! 1 day\n\n## Comment ID inneprz with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inneprz/) (in reply to ID x922ci):\nNAD+ & PC IV therapy on a regular basis, also Ten Pass Ozone in the spring and fall. \n\nFind a good functional medicine doctor and get on a personalized supplement regimen. \n\nFive Element Acupuncture (and herbal medicine). \n\nAll of this was life changing stuff for me.\n\n## Comment ID inpodn8 with +1 score by [(swerve408, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inpodn8/) (in reply to ID x922ci):\nWon’t genetic testing possibly impact your health insurance quotes/rates?\n\nAlso I feel like some of the things you listed such as fasting, probiotics, supplements, cold/heat exposure etc are absolutely meaningless if your sleep quality and length is poor \n\nIt’s like trying to chase the best savings account yield percentage while not focusing on growing your income\n\n## Comment ID inps7iu with +1 score by [(anotherfireburner, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/x922ci/longevity_health_optimization_and_maintaining/inps7iu/) (in reply to ID x922ci):\nBiggest thing I regret not doing in my 20s and 30s is regular dental checkups.

The reason I make this distinction is that competition is usually not the way to optimize health, and I've heard that marathon-running is at a point where it's not maximally healthy.  If that's what most people are into here, that's fine and dandy, but that's not what I'm personally looking for.\n\nSo if my only goal is to be maximally healthy, how exactly should I be incorporating running?

My routine is similar to what you mention, but I throw in a long run of at least 10 km once a week.

Races are great motivation, but I never aim to compete against anyone but myself--namely, my past self. (These last bits are anecdotal, of course.)\n\nHowever OP, I would not run 4 consecutive days. You need some rest days (or cross-training, too) in between runs. They say these rest days are when your body really works to build your strength.

Whether there is a maximum volume after which health benefits go down again is still a controversial question; some studies seem to support this hypothesis, but flaws have been pointed out in all of them so far.\n\nThen, a very important variable is training. 30 miles per week is \"maintenance\" for me, while for a brand new runner it'd be way above their abilities, and for an elite marathoner it would essentially be a week off. It's all relative, training above your level isn't sustainable, but as you adapt to training, your limit will shift, and what is a reasonable volume depends on that.\n\nGiven all this, there is no clear answer, because it depends on so many things. What can your body handle naturally? What's your running fitness like? What kind of injury / overtraining risk are you willing to accept? How hard are your workouts?\n\nThere is not anything fundamentally unhealthy about running marathons; problems arise when people *race* them, pushing their limits - as with any sport, doing that comes at a risk, and while the risks of running long distance may be different than those seen in other sports, the reason people get hurt has little to do with the distance per se. If you are trained for it and go at a pace that is well within your comfort zone, then even ultramarathon distances aren't really all that hardcore. I've done 10k races that were definitely harder on my body than some 30-40 mile runs I've done at a comfortable (as far as such a thing as \"comfort\" exists past mile 20) pace. Humans have run much longer distances than that throughout history; even the legenday Pheidippides, who inspired the Marathon as a discipline, didn't just run from Marathon to Athens (~25 miles) - he ran from Marathon to Sparta (some 120 miles) in one day, then back the next day, then participated in the battle, and THEN he'd run to Athens, where he collapsed from exhaustion (but probably survived - the dying part may be just poetic hyperbole). So not \"25 miles and then death\", but \"almost 300 miles and a battle, and he still made it\". And he was just doing his job; Greek armies employed professional runners who would routinely run upwards of 100 miles in a day as part of their jobs.\n\nSoooo... what do?\n\nBasically, if you want to run for health, and have your strength covered with lifting, then I'd recommend starting with some beginner program (couch to 5k, a.k.a. c25k, is good), and from there, gently work your way up to where you can comfortably run for an hour or so, at a leisurely pace, a couple times per week (putting you in the 3-5 hours per week range). It seems that this is approximately where the cost / benefit ration of maintaining the required training volume starts shelving off - you still get upwards of 90% of the health benefits, and if trained properly, a very very small risk of serious damage or injury. \"Every other day\" seems like a decent balance to me - for a beginner, more days may be too taxing, and later it may not be worth pushing for more, especially if you also do other exercise.\n\n\"Conserving energy\" is not a concern btw; lifting doesn't burn that much, and taps into different energy sources (slow running is mainly fat and some glycogen, but you need to keep going for about 3 hours or so to make a serious dent in your glyco stores), while lifting mainly runs on ATP, and gets refilled from available carbs (but you can never possibly lift enough to deplete the glyco stores). So if you \"run out of energy\", what really happens is that your muscles aren't recovered yet. But if you run at a truly slow pace, and lift heavy (hi-res, lo-rep), then you will almost exclusively recruit slow-twitch fibres for running, and fast-twitch for lifting. OTOH, if you run too fast, running will use fast-twitch too, and the result is slow progress on the running front, and jelly legs when lifting after running.\n\n### Comment ID em34zlw with +5 score by [(OracleOfOntario, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em34zlw/) (in reply to ID em31y9d):\nwow, great post, that's some sage advice.\n\n## Comment ID em2okkw with +10 score by [(ithinkitsbeertime, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em2okkw/) (in reply to ID birz8u):\nThe CDC says:\n\n>For substantial health benefts, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) to 300 minutes (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes) to 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity.  \n>  \n>Preferably, aerobic activity should be spread throughout the week. Additional health benefts are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond the equivalent of 300 minutes (5 hours) of moderate-intensity physical activity a week.\n\nThey define 'moderate' and 'vigorous' in terms of METs but jogging / running probably meets the thresholds for vigorous unless you're walking big parts of it. So 3-4 days of 30-45 minutes would certainly get you there. Lifting of course also counts. I don't think I'd schedule my days consecutively though, I'd probably alternate running and lifting.\n\n### Comment ID em2ouwt with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em2ouwt/) (in reply to ID em2okkw):\nAlright, this sounds good.\n\n### Comment ID em7vtue with +1 score by [(myprivatethroway, Reddit, 2019-05-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em7vtue/) (in reply to ID em2okkw):\nWhat does *at least \"range\"*  mean?\n\n  \n\n\nAt least 150 minutes of work is a lot less than at least 300 minutes of work\n\n## Comment ID em2q2ba with +9 score by [(OracleOfOntario, Reddit, 2019-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/birz8u/best_way_to_do_running_for_maximal_health_and/em2q2ba/) (in reply to ID birz8u):\nI too run for health, but the competition aspect makes it way more fun if you plan on running over many years.

The border between Z1 and Z2 representing the first lactate turnpoint \\~ 2mmol. The border between Z2 and Z3 representing the second turnpoint \\~ 4mmol.In this model, Zone 2 would be similar to a Zone 3 (on a Five Zone scale) - correlating with somewhere around 80-85% of Max HR.\n\nIn any case, I don't know if I have misinterpreted the question, but it seems many replies have read the question differently than I.\n\nThe subject is asking if \"cardio is necessary\", but the main body implies if high intensity cardio is necessary, or if his long walks are adequate.\n\nI'm still new to this subject as a whole but I've immersed myself in it over the past six months, digesting hours of content from Peter Attia, Mike Joyner, Andy Gaupin, Huberman, Stephen Seiler, etc. Stephen in particular has a lot of specialised content on youtube focusing on this, and \"how low is too low\" intensity wise.\n\nI'd direct you to this chart ([https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/coggan-s-physiological-adaptation-chart/75468](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/coggan-s-physiological-adaptation-chart/75468)) which shows the different adaptations (or lack thereof) that happen during cardio at different intensity.\n\nReally, if your goal is to improve VO2 max -- long walks are not adequate. That doesn't mean you wont enjoy those walks and still burn calories - but it won't do wonders for VO2max. That chart will loosely illustrate the amount of Vo2 max improvements you'll get from each intensity level - as well as a plethora of other adaptations that occur. It's quite informative. (I focus on Vo2 max purely as that's typically touted as one of the best predictors of longevity as a whole, but there are tons of other benefits from high intensity cardio).\n\nA simple cardio workout routine (which has worked for me, improving my 5K time from over 30 minutes to less than 19 minutes across a four month time span) has been:\n\n3 x \"Zone 2\" runs (based on the 5-HR Zones) for 45-75 minutes per run (dependent on how much time I have - more the better)  \nand  \n1 x \"Vo2 max protocol\" - my preference is 1km repeats (running at 95% effort for 1km) with a 1:1 rest recovery ratio. Repeat this 5-6 times, with 1.5km warm up.  \n\n\nIf I get time for another run, I'll typically throw in a Tempo or Threshold Run (eg. running for 5-10K at 90% of max HR).\n\nThat improved my Vo2 max from 35 (estimate) to 55 (estimate) across those same four months. (Estimate based on the average of both Apple Watch and the vo2 max estimate that the Cooper Test (12 minute run) formula spits out).\n\n## Comment ID k92m2md with +8 score by [(eat_natural, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k92m2md/) (in reply to ID 17ub1wx):\nIt’s my understanding that cardiorespiratory fitness has distinct health benefits over weight resistance training. While there are overlapping benefits between the two, cardiorespiratory exercises have a stronger beneficial impact on vascular health by improving the amount of nitric oxide present, blood vessel responsiveness to nitric oxide, and thus, a lower resting blood pressure. Beyond that, there is evidence to suggest that endothelial integrity is improved with a lower likelihood of lipoprotein penetration into the endothelium. Separately, there is also evidence that running stabilizes pre-existing atherosclerotic plaque and also reduces plaque volume / size. Angiogenesis is another benefit, where additional blood vessel growth occurs, while also dilating and enlarging existing blood vessels. There is evidence that endurance training reduces risk of sudden cardiac death from arrhythmia. Endurance training has a more significant impact on cardiac function, such as stroke volume, as well as VO2 max. It is my understanding that VO2 max is the strongest predictor of longevity, more so than insulin resistance, hypertension, obesity, etc.  Both weight resistance training and endurance training improve glucose and lipid metabolism. \n\n[Exercise benefits in cardiovascular diseases: from mechanisms to clinical implementation. Pedro L. Valenzuela.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37005351/)\n\nTo answer your question specifically, if you’re lifting hard enough at a high degree of effort and intensity, you will probably derive some of the above benefits. I do believe you would obtain additional benefit by incorporating some endurance training. Hopping on the stairclimber at the gym may be a practical way to build lower strength while incorporating endurance training.\n\n### Comment ID k95ka8m with +1 score by [(toothmanhelpting, Reddit, 2023-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k95ka8m/) (in reply to ID k92m2md):\nTo sum it up….

Overall this is worth thinking on, though Milo is talking about 6 days/week of lifting plus a lot of steps, not OPs 3 days.\n\nMy critiques of the Wolf approach are (i) a sufficiently powered subgroup analysis is probably needed to even consider a concentrated approach like that (ii) Wolf doesn't seem to appreciate a basic point about risk management-- i.e. a more diversified approach tends to pay off quite well for long term investments in a very uncertain environment (iii) Attia emphasizes performance metrics  like VO2 max which Wolf criticizes as having a major genetic component  so he wants to look at hours of effort instead... but completely ignoring performance is a bit ironic as Wolf is a strength coach so surely he appreciates the fact that *well designed and executed* lifting programs are not remotely comparable in results to that of the typical gym goer even when hours are equated... and the idea that training quality doesn't impact healthspan strikes me a as quite leap.\n\n### Comment ID k941wwe with +4 score by [(AndeyR, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k941wwe/) (in reply to ID k93hcyy):\nI feel like Peter gamifies VO2max too much, its a proxy, and chances are, training specifically for this number would not do much (or would not be as effective as someone doing sports and getting to this number as a byproduct)\n\nNext step would be to train grip strength )\n\n#### Comment ID k946hc4 with +2 score by [(NotSaucerman, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k946hc4/) (in reply to ID k941wwe):\nYea, I anticipate Peter to deprecate VO2 max over time in favor of a basket of cardio  indicators once more data becomes available.

Doing things that improve your heart health is probably a good way to improve health span.\n\nI think the reason people don't like cardio is because they buy into the \"no pain, no gain\" mentality.\n\nFor example, embracing long duration zone 2 isn't really that \"intensive\". I think it can actually be boring...so I tend to do it on an indoor bike while playing video games.\n\nI don't do the high intensity intervals as described by Attia. Instead, I've been doing clean and jerks with double kettlebells 3 days a week (modified version of Geoff Neupert's Long Cycle of Death program). About 100 reps spread over 30 minutes in various rep schemes. Lots of time in Zone 5, but with work periods on the order of 15-30 seconds (depending on rep scheme) and similar rest periods. But each workout has 30-40 sets depending on the rep scheme.\n\nSo not the prescription Peter gives, but my guess is that it's fine provided I'm not trying to be an elite cyclist. And it's way easier on my knees than sprinting. Seems to me like a great combination of strength and cardio. It's the only workout where I really get that \"runner's high\".

This is typically correlated with 65-80% of max HR - but everyone's will actually be different. But if you reach that range with brisk walking, then yes - Zone 2 can be achieved.\n\nHowever as you get fitter, you will notice you can now maintain the same pace as before, but at a much lower heart rate - meaning you will have to increase the intensity to stay in that zone. Whether this is simply ramping up the incline %, or if you need to up the pace to a slow jog.\n\nMost people will sustain Zone 2 with a slow jog - you definitely do not have to \"run\" to stay in Zone 2 (subjective - if you're fit enough to run fast relative to others in Zone 2, you probably still don't perceive that run as a fast run, since you'd be capable of running even faster I guess!).\n\nFor me, when I first started cardio six months ago. Here's some stats for comparison:\n\nApril 19th, 2023. \"Zone 2 run\" (My Max HR is 199. Zone 2 for me is estimated at 128-160)4KM was at Zone 2 (about 30 mins) and the last 1KM was at a faster pace.\n\n1KM, 6:34, 154 HR1KM, 7:07, 160 HR1KM, 7:30, 154 HR1KM, 6:35, 154 HR1KM, 5:39, 167 HR\n\nSo that average pace of around 6:30 minutes per KM, kept me in Zone 2.\n\nHowever fast forward six months, I now need to run at around 5:00-5:15 per KM to stay in the same HR zone. Back when I started, 1 KM at 5:00 was the same time as my max 1km effort! Now I can sustain this for 15+km IN \"zone 2\" heart rate range...\n\nTL;DR - You could sustain a Zone 2 workout with brisk walks, but as your fitness improves, walking pace may no longer be sufficient.\n\nStephen Seiler has an interesting youtube video on low intensity, and \"How low is too low\" eg. Zone 1 vs Zone 2. Would recommend a lot of his content too!\n\n## Comment ID l92ehfi with +1 score by [(gettotea, Reddit, 2024-06-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/l92ehfi/) (in reply to ID 17ub1wx):\nBookmark\n\n## Comment ID k92v3mv with +1 score by [(medhat20005, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/17ub1wx/cardio_necessary_for_optimal_health_and_longevity/k92v3mv/) (in reply to ID 17ub1wx):\nIf the goal is to \"optimize health and longevity,\" I would guess (really, it's all somewhat educated guessing anyways) that more, but not too much more, than long slow walks would derive most of the benefits of a more structured zone 2 workout several times a week.

      "# Post ID 53h3ai: Body Damage is BETTER than Max Health at reducing regeneration time. with +39 score by [(bejammin075, Reddit, 2016-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diepio/comments/53h3ai/body_damage_is_better_than_max_health_at_reducing/)\nMany diep.io players know that spending points on Max Health will reduce the amount of time it takes to regenerate from damage. I had been wondering if Body Damage has an effect on regeneration, especially after reading the excellent post [Health vs Body Damage vs Penetration vs Damage](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diepio/comments/52pxv3/health_vs_body_damage_vs_penetration_vs_damage/) by /u/Diepio_Player, which showed that Body Damage was superior to Max Health in preventing damage to your tank, and showed further that a combination of Body Damage plus Max Health was the most efficient, with somewhat more Body Damage than Max Health being the most optimal (assuming you aren't spending 7 points on those categories). /u/Diepio_Player's work was preceded by detailed experiments by /u/Maikri (which somehow I missed) who had shown similar results in [Experiment to optimize health to body damage ratio](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diepio/comments/514cx4/experiment_to_optimize_health_to_body_damage_ratio/) a few weeks ago.  \n\nThose experiments did a great job looking at the initial damage taken, and I wondered about regeneration. If Body Damage was superior to Max Health in reducing the initial damage, I guessed that there would be a trade-off in regeneration. My guess was that Max Health would assist regeneration, and that Body Damage would not. I tested this accurately in Sandbox, and I guessed wrong!  \n\nHere was the test: Sandbox mode with an Attacker and a Defender. I calibrated the damage such that almost all regeneration would take place in 30 seconds or less, so that the results would not involve the universal 30 second regen. The Attacker was a Level 45 Destroyer with 0-0-0-0-3-2-0-0, and the Defender was a Level 45 Basic Tank with various regen, health and body damage. I always fired the damage shot from the same point blank range, and timed the regen on a stopwatch, with 2 measurements for each time. If the 2 time measurements differed by more than 1/10th of a second, I made a 3rd measurement and kept the 2 consistent times to take an average. The times I recorded were very consistent, so I didn't have to take many 3rd measurements.\n\nDefender | Time to Regenerate\n---------|-------------------\n7-0-0 | 26.0\n7-7-0 | 13.2\n7-0-7 | 11.1\n7-7-7 | 5.9\n\nI was considering how to optimize a build with 4 points on Regeneration, and 8 points on the other two stats. Which configuration will allow my Mega Trapper to withstand the most brutal punishment?\n\nDefender | Time to Regenerate\n---------|-------------------\n4-1-7 | 16.4\n4-2-6 | 15.9\n4-3-5 | 15.9\n4-4-4 | 15.9\n4-5-3 | 16.5\n4-6-2 | 17.4\n4-7-1 | 18.7\n\nIn conclusion, when you have some Regeneration and also two or more points to spend on Max Health plus Body Damage, go with a mix of 50-50 to 75-25, favoring the Body Damage. This will allow your tank to take the least initial damage, and also to regenerate the fastest. Adjust your builds accordingly.\n\nEdit: I took a loot at the \"Book of Builds\" link (on the sidebar). There is a lot of improvement that can be made on the various builds. Here's what I tallied, ignoring tanks that focus on Body Damage because they already have 6+ points on MH and BD:  \nTanks with optimal Max Health and Body Damage ratios: 7  \nTanks with both Max Health and Body Damage, but non-optimal: 5  \nTanks with 2+ points on Max Health, but 0 points on Body damage: 47  \n\nSo 7 tanks were optimal, and 52 were non-optimal.\n\n## Comment ID d7szzst with +6 score by [(bejammin075, Reddit, 2016-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diepio/comments/53h3ai/body_damage_is_better_than_max_health_at_reducing/d7szzst/) (in reply to ID 53h3ai):\nI forgot to add, if 4-4-4 and 4-2-6 have the same regeneration time, the 4-2-6 would be preferred because you also have the more damaging body damage for collisions with tanks and shapes.\n\n### Comment ID d7t42pd with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2016-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diepio/comments/53h3ai/body_damage_is_better_than_max_health_at_reducing/d7t42pd/) (in reply to ID d7szzst):\nYou can edit that into your post.\n\n#### Comment ID d7t4sea with +2 score by [(bejammin075, Reddit, 2016-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diepio/comments/53h3ai/body_damage_is_better_than_max_health_at_reducing/d7t4sea/) (in reply to ID d7t42pd):\nThanks.

Yeah, points on regeneration have the most influence on regeneration. I did a lot more testing than what I posted here. With the same 12 points to spend, you can get faster and faster regen with more points on regen (and assuming using optimized MH and BD), but the returns are diminishing. The 6th and especially 7th point on regen doesn't reduce the regen time very much. With these 12 points to spend, I'd do 5 at the most on regen.  \nWhat made me think hard about all this is I'm really trying to beat the Mega Trapper FFA WR, and playing with a crappy tank really forces you to think carefully about how each point is spent.

A few weeks before sandbox came out and all these test were made I had an idea. So max hp is how much hp you have an regen is how fast you regen your hp. Since body damage acts as a shield that would mean that the amount of hp it has to regen is less, since it doesn't add hp to the tank, but rather decreases the damage it takes form bullets. Whereas max hp increases your hp, meaning the you will have to regen more hp. I didn't test this out whatsoever (even when sandbox came out) because I knew I was correct. I made a Post and a few comments about my build based on the idea I had, but no one paid much attention. But know with actual numbers, people would creat better build meaning the game would become more fun  (challenging) and I won't have to comment on those supposingly best builds that have regen and even not a single body damage. When making that prediction, I have thought that body damage is worse than max hp, but since it gives better regen, then it should mean that you can jump from one battle to another faster (which also basically means better chance of surviving when sourounded or being teamed upon). But it also happens that body damage is better than max hp, making the build that I used at the time the probably the best overlord/hybrid build at that time (I don't rly use other classes).\n\n### Comment ID d7tgrsp with +1 score by [(bejammin075, Reddit, 2016-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diepio/comments/53h3ai/body_damage_is_better_than_max_health_at_reducing/d7tgrsp/) (in reply to ID d7tei6w):\nYeah, I've been using this info to make a tougher Overlord that can take a few punches.

I love this topic.\n\n\\- Vitamix. Transformed my diet by making hardcore green smoothies everyday.\n\n\\- Instant pot company's Air fryer: Increased my veggie consumption by a ton\n\n\\- Luminette: for bright light while working, moving around etc.\n\n\\- Wellue O2 ring: to measure oxygen levels during sleep and improve it by experimentation\n\n\\- Amazon's halo tracker: very nice and cheap tracker.  I use it for multiple things.\n\n\\- Nasal dilator thingy by Mute: improved my sleep breathing dramatically.\n\n\\- Jal Neti pot: again for better breathing through out the day.\n\n\\- Gym membership: stair climber has changed my cardio health. that's what I use mostly\n\n\\- timer: I use this for progressive breathing exercises. another game changer\n\n\\- Navaratna Ayurvedic Oil: cooling oil for head, relaxes the brain quickly. Awesome for sleep and meditation\n\n\\- Acupuncture sessions: pretty expensive but made a major difference in multiple areas\n\n\\- LifePro leg massager: use this while working all the time. Keeps the blood circulation going\n\n\\- Necklow pillow: nice pillow that works well for side sleeping\n\n\\- Kindle Paperwhite: I use this before sleep. Avoids use of phone and warm light feature is awesome before sleep.\n\n\\- Buying some meditations and subscription to meditation apps: very helpful for various scenarios.\n\n\\- Kachava Protein powder: the best I've found.\n\n\\- Vitamineral Green powder is awesome for upping nutrition quickly.\n\n\\- Various supplements like Magnesium, Vinia, Sulforphane, liquid b12, mushroom powder to improve inflammation and blood circulation.\n\n\\- Lots of Pomegranates: They are a bit pricey but benefits are worth it. they are the best fruit ever for your heart, blood vessels, microbiome and so on. I buy and eat like 10-14 every week. Check this video for some research: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wzd2X2U6C68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wzd2X2U6C68)\n\n\\- A great knife: I try to eat a lot more produce recently and having a nice knife makes it pleasurable.\n\n\\- Green pressed juices: Very healthy and low calorie. Trader Joes has a great one.\n\n\\- Memory foam seat cushion for sitting longer periods\n\n\\- I just ordered a standing desk contraption for my regular desk from Amazon. (FITUEYES)\n\nI'm still experimenting with Airofit (for improving VO2 max), red light therapy and so on.\n\n### Comment ID itwjihf with +4 score by [(lejulio, Reddit, 2022-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/ydi2h0/best_purchases_youve_made_to_improve_your_quality/itwjihf/) (in reply to ID itw7ffz):\nVery interesting thank you.

Not a tracker.\n\nNothing can do what o2 ring does. It gives precise measurements of oxygen throughout sleep in a convenient way. I haven't found anything close to it.\n\nFitbit/Garmin/apple watch can probably do what Halo does. I hated Fitbits app tbh. It's not about the raw measurements but how the insights are shown in the app and Fitbit's app was a mess when I tried it few years ago. I think Halo's app does a remarkable job with: activity minutes and scores, sleep graphs and measurements, resting heart rate, continuous heart rate (for workout). \n\nI'm also trying a CGM for glucose. It's been pretty helpful too.\n\n### Comment ID kbdovec with +1 score by [(consciousnesscloud, Reddit, 2023-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/ydi2h0/best_purchases_youve_made_to_improve_your_quality/kbdovec/) (in reply to ID itw7ffz):\nhi how do you use the navratna oil, not much info online?\n\n## Comment ID itsgffl with +50 score by [(MagicalGinny, Reddit, 2022-10-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/ydi2h0/best_purchases_youve_made_to_improve_your_quality/itsgffl/) (in reply to ID ydi2h0):\nInstant Pot 11-in-1\n\nBasic gym equipment\n\nNeti Pot\n\nAudiobooks (educational)\n\nGarmin watch\n\nHeart Rate Monitor\n\nBasic pre-workout supplements (no filler)\n\nSunrise alarm clock\n\nVisits with an apt psychotherapist\n\nAnd of course... a dog 🐕\n\n### Comment ID ittciqz with +8 score by [(beanie_0, Reddit, 2022-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/ydi2h0/best_purchases_youve_made_to_improve_your_quality/ittciqz/) (in reply to ID itsgffl):\nNeti pot is a life saver when I’ve been to the city or get bunged up 🙌🏻\n\n### Comment ID itsw0at with +8 score by [(pebblebypebble, Reddit, 2022-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/ydi2h0/best_purchases_youve_made_to_improve_your_quality/itsw0at/) (in reply to ID itsgffl):\nI second the dog and the garmin!\n\n### Comment ID itsufzs with +2 score by [(suitsnwatches, Reddit, 2022-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/ydi2h0/best_purchases_youve_made_to_improve_your_quality/itsufzs/) (in reply to ID itsgffl):\nCurious to know what heart rate monitor you use/what’s your pre workout\n\n#### Comment ID itze665 with +2 score by [(MagicalGinny, Reddit, 2022-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/ydi2h0/best_purchases_youve_made_to_improve_your_quality/itze665/) (in reply to ID itsufzs):\nI used to use the Garmin HRM, but they tend to konk out after about a year of daily use.

The Oura USP is their sleep score algorithms which give a score out of 100 for every sleep session. Initially they were a great startup with their Gen2 ring, truly admirable in their business model and product offering. Then they shifted to sponsoring athletes and now the customer pays for those sponsorship deals in monthly billing. \n\nIt’s powerful to quantify sleep but as you say your Apple Watch has robust sleep tracking and does a WHOLE lot more than oura ever will.\n\nOura will be run off the road in next few years as Apple tunes their algorithms. Oura’s speciality is now monthly billing for features they used to include for free. Pricey gimmick which I can’t recommend. \n\nOnce Google bring out the Pixel watch 2 with decent all-day battery that will allow daily sleep (hassle free) tracking and tune their sleep algorithms - there simply won’t be space for Oura to offer anything unique. This may sound like Oura-hate speech but I was a long time follower of the company and sung their praises to anyone I could.\n\n#### Comment ID iv5e1xy with +1 score by [(NimblyBimblyMeyow, Reddit, 2022-11-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/ydi2h0/best_purchases_youve_made_to_improve_your_quality/iv5e1xy/) (in reply to ID ittcfgy):\nI also have the Apple Watch and use it for sleep, but it can’t track day sleeping accurately unfortunately.

It will not do ANYTHING for you unless you do something with the data it provides, but as a personal trainer who has been programming for clients for years - I can harness the power of that data very well.\n\n* I've used mine to get down from a more-or-less stable bodyfat percentage of around 15% to a more-or-less stable bodyfat percentage of around 12%. (measured by bioelectrical impedance machine every month)\n* I've used its data to help motivate me to change my sleeping habits, including going to sleep 2 hours earlier and waking up 2.5 hours earlier (so sleeping a little less, but higher quality sleep and feeling more refreshed).\n* A big, big one is that it helped me understand that I was just overall way too active, especially because I walked a lot. I eventually realized that if my fitbit says I burned around 24,000 cals/week I feel on the edge of okay, if it says I burned 25,000 cals in a week, I feel like dried up dog shit. Now I'm more still during my rest days, and even more still on days that I have a big workout planned, and I feel literally like I'm ten years younger. Staying under 23,000 cals/week is now a big part of my life-routine.\n* It also helped motivate me to resume my meditation habit. I realized that on weeks where I meditated my resting heart-rate was much lower, and my HRV was much higher. Even though I ALSO felt a dozen other benefits from meditating, I didn't have anything quantitative to motivate me. So now I meditate every day again, partly because I can SEE the effects every morning when I wake up and check my fitbit.\n\n## Comment ID ituz3dn with +16 score by [(jane4now, Reddit, 2022-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/ydi2h0/best_purchases_youve_made_to_improve_your_quality/ituz3dn/) (in reply to ID ydi2h0):\nContinuous Glucose Monitor.

Main motivation to help with anxiety and depression. Each time I do 3 sittings usually in 85 C for 20, 18, 15 min. Between each sitting I naturally cool for about 10-15 min. I make an effort to drink extra water before, during and after each sitting, usually I add a little salt to the water. My heart usually start beating harder around 10 min mark, beating really hard at the 15 min mark. The last minutes are usually really tuff and when I exit the sauna i have to sit down and close my eyes trying to calm my heartbeat and relax. After around 5-10 min I start to relax and feel great, rushes of good feelings.\n\nWould you change anything to optimize health/well-being either according to science or personal experience?\n\n## Comment ID jyoceg0 with +17 score by [(John_Sux, Reddit, 2023-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sauna/comments/16790tw/optimal_use_for_healthwellbeing/jyoceg0/) (in reply to ID 16790tw):\nIf you want to use the sauna to help with things like anxiety and depression and stress, the goal should be comfort and a lack of strict routine. Forget the numbers, degrees and minutes, smart watches, **optimization**. Do whatever you like, and feel like doing. Don't stay in the sauna past discomfort just because someone online said they do X minutes at Y temperature, you have no business trying to reach that. Stay in the sauna as long as you're comfortable, cool down however you like and do multiple sessions in the sauna if you're up for that, and finish with a good shower.  \n\nIf you just relax and don't stress the details, going to sauna may help with those positive mental health outcomes.  \n\nAs for other health benefits, they are mainly things seen over decades of use. You will see nothing immediate, and nothing depends on exact degrees and temperatures on a particular day, once again. All else tends to be quackery, stuff for workaholics who have been lied to about a shortcut to success.\n\n### Comment ID jypkf6k with +5 score by [(money_mase19, Reddit, 2023-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sauna/comments/16790tw/optimal_use_for_healthwellbeing/jypkf6k/) (in reply to ID jyoceg0):\nI like how this was phrased\n\n#### Comment ID jypz7t2 with +7 score by [(TerryFGM, Reddit, 2023-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sauna/comments/16790tw/optimal_use_for_healthwellbeing/jypz7t2/) (in reply to ID jypkf6k):\nJohn_sux might seem prickly but he usually has a good take on stuff\n\n### Comment ID jyppw7t with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sauna/comments/16790tw/optimal_use_for_healthwellbeing/jyppw7t/) (in reply to ID jyoceg0):\nvery good comment!\n\nMy advice is that you try make sauna a part of your normal routine. The sauna itself does not work miracles, even if the Finns say so.\n\nSauna is like meditation, going to sauna and having those \"healing\" benefits (mental) requires the right state of mind, practice and peace of mind.\n\nIf you are clinically anxious or depressed, you may not have enough peace of mind to have fully relaxing sauna experience, but still it might help little.\n\nThe shock of a sauna and cold water or snow, can take a depressed person away from that horrible feeling of anxiety for a while, but unfortunately it doesn't fix anything in long run. Sauna can help recovery from mental challenges if there are other means involved, such as therapy, exercise, diet and possibly medication. Sauna is meditation.\n\n#### Comment ID jysappb with +5 score by [(DefinitelyNotSully, Reddit, 2023-09-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sauna/comments/16790tw/optimal_use_for_healthwellbeing/jysappb/) (in reply to ID jyppw7t):\n> The sauna itself does not work miracles, even if the Finns say so.\n\nWe don't say so.

Don't treat it as a performance, and instead like a bath or shower. Do you also prep for those or wash for some specific minimum time? No? \n\nFor example, I can drop whatever I do, like if I'm cooking or eating, and go sauna when I'm told it's ready/free. Only preparation I do is have a sixpack of long drink in the fridge so that I can have one while cooling off.

      "# Post ID 17swfux: Place in SP to check bloodwork, vitamin deficiencies, optimize testosterone levels? with +0 score by [(lumberjackabroad, Reddit, 2023-11-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brazil/comments/17swfux/place_in_sp_to_check_bloodwork_vitamin/)\nHey everyone, \n\nI'm in a real optimization phase of my life watching a lot of Dr. Huberman, Chris Williamson-type videos and want to optimize my testosterone naturally. (30yo M)\n\nOne of the first things you need to do is get bloodwork done to see your baseline levels and vitamin deficiencies. Anyone recommend a place to do this in Zona Sul SP? \n\nI've also seen many Brazilians have doctors they go to in order to optimize health/performance. Any recommendations in Zona Sul SP? \n\nThank you!\n\n## Comment ID k8svmm3 with +6 score by [(Plane_Passion, Reddit, 2023-11-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brazil/comments/17swfux/place_in_sp_to_check_bloodwork_vitamin/k8svmm3/) (in reply to ID 17swfux):\nI don't really know what you mean by \"optimize my health\", but yes, you can do bloodwork on a lot of places (we call them \"laboratorios\", or labs). Most well known are Fleury, Lavoisier, CBD (Delboni Auriemo), and A+.\n\nThey are everywhere, but first you will need a doctor's note requesting such exams. As you mention testosterone and vitamin levels, I believe an endocrinologist is what you need. Cheers.\n\n### Comment ID k8xnk9z with +2 score by [(lisavieta, Reddit, 2023-11-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brazil/comments/17swfux/place_in_sp_to_check_bloodwork_vitamin/k8xnk9z/) (in reply to ID k8svmm3):\nMost exams can be done without a doctor's request but then your health insurance won't cover it and it can be quite pricey.\n\n## Comment ID k8sv5qn with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-11-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brazil/comments/17swfux/place_in_sp_to_check_bloodwork_vitamin/k8sv5qn/) (in reply to ID 17swfux):\nYou will need to be at a nutrologist. Usually they are the ones who can help you with that. Or something regard to sports medicine. In Moema you will find many of this clinics, just don’t go to one called Genesis, they are charlatans , and will ask for you to do many exams in there so they can sell it. The nutrologist is a full asshole and will do shit for you. If you have a very good insurance, Albert Einstein opened a new area of sports medicine, but I’m sure it will be expansive.\n\n### Comment ID k8to05r with +2 score by [(lumberjackabroad, Reddit, 2023-11-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brazil/comments/17swfux/place_in_sp_to_check_bloodwork_vitamin/k8to05r/) (in reply to ID k8sv5qn):\n>nutrologist\n\nThank you, this is just what I was looking for!\n\n\n\n## Comment ID k9u5fl0 with +1 score by [(Tricky_Worry8889, Reddit, 2023-11-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brazil/comments/17swfux/place_in_sp_to_check_bloodwork_vitamin/k9u5fl0/) (in reply to ID 17swfux):\nYou can likely just get any supplements you need from Amazon.  I don't really see a doctor prescribing you anything you can't get OTC unless you have a serious outstanding issue.  \n\n  \nPlenty of places to get blood work done.   Between that and listening to Huberman you should be able to figure it out yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5mg ED tadalafila is a major life hack for lean muscle gains and other benefits btw."

In addition, the information they give you for these cold calls is CONSTANTLY incorrect &amp; incomplete. So making these calls can be hard. - This company will almost certainly take advantage of you if you apply for this position. Story: I was the very first member of their brand new RPO team as I had recently graduated with my bachelors. About 6 months in, I told them I didn’t know if this job was for me &amp; I had gotten another job offer elsewhere. I was absolutely convinced to stay and told I was needed. ….They hired more people a few months later, as well as hired a contracted call center team from India, and let me go with zero warning. Not even 1 day. -The “Enrollment Specialist” job posting does not at all match up to what the job actually entails. Also note that there are no benefits included, no equipment reimbursement. (Although for some reason Benefits are attached to the Enrollment Specialist job posting.) Don't be fooled. This is a contract position &amp; they don’t tell you that until the interview. -Leadership has no problem lying or trying to deceive lower level employees",

So making these calls can be hard. - This company will almost certainly take advantage of you if you apply for this position. Story: I was the very first member of their brand new RPO team as I had recently graduated with my bachelors. About 6 months in, I told them I didn’t know if this job was for me &amp; I had gotten another job offer elsewhere. I was absolutely convinced to stay and told I was needed. ….They hired more people a few months later, as well as hired a contracted call center team from India, and let me go with zero warning. Not even 1 day. -The “Enrollment Specialist” job posting does not at all match up to what the job actually entails. Also note that there are no benefits included, no equipment reimbursement. (Although for some reason Benefits are attached to the Enrollment Specialist job posting.) Don't be fooled. This is a contract position &amp; they don’t tell you that until the interview. -Leadership has no problem lying or trying to deceive lower level employees",

      "# [Sait Tunc receives NSF CAREER award to optimize health care systems for equitable outcomes on 2024-04-05](https://news.vt.edu/articles/2024/04/tunc-career-award.html)\nIn an effort to revolutionize the health care system through operations research and systems engineering, Sait Tunc, an assistant professor in the Grado Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, has received a National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award.\n\nThe CAREER program supports early career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education and lead advances in the missions of their department or organization. This five-year grant totaling $568,619 will support Tunc’s research on inefficiencies in health care systems, particularly with respect to organ transplants. And it couldn’t be more timely.\n\nTunc’s research regarding organ utilization comes at a pivotal time in the industry. While organ scarcity exists, there is also a significant level of underutilization. Roughly 25 percent of organs recovered from deceased donors go unused for a variety of reasons. Patients may refuse organ offers because they come from a relatively higher risk donor, or they may choose to wait to see if another “better” organ becomes available. Additionally, patients with access to higher quality health care may receive special priority.\n\n“I want to identify disadvantaged patients and improve their access to organs. Federal law prevents penalizing patients for rejecting organ offers, which creates a gap between what is optimal for the individuals and how they behave. One mechanism I developed identifies disadvantaged patient groups who have reduced access to organs, thus a higher mortality rate,” Tunc said.\n\nIn addition to matching organs to recipients more efficiently, Tunc also wants to ensure equitable access for all in need. Perhaps surprisingly, this means taking into consideration voluntary incentive mechanisms, which prioritize motivating patients based on data rather than removing the option of choice. For example, instead of mandating participation, such as forcing a patient to accept an organ of relatively lower quality, voluntary incentive mechanisms give patients agency by showing them why they could reject an organ, but why they’d be better off accepting it rather than, say, remaining on dialysis.\n\n“We use data modeling to prioritize these patients for organ offers that are most beneficial to them. This improves the match between donors and recipients and addresses the issue of organ underutilization,” Tunc said. “The challenge in organ procurement is not just about finding more donors, but ensuring that the organs are used efficiently and equitably. I want to bridge the gap between what is best for society and how individuals behave.”\n\nIncentivizing healthy behavior\n\nVoluntary incentive mechanisms work at large-scale and individual levels, and Tunc’s research addresses both. He investigates how these strategies lead to an increase in wellness-related behaviors, such as exercise or tobacco cessation. This aspect of his proposal aims to encourage healthier behaviors considering that not everyone has the same level of delay discounting and using someone’s willingness to adopt healthier activities based on what reward they would receive if they change their habits.\n\n“My primary goal with this research is to design and implement voluntary incentive mechanisms in the health care field, for both organizations and individuals,” Tunc said. “Rather than use coercion or mandated participation, voluntary incentive mechanisms encourage participants through rewards. These tend to make implementing new strategies easier compared to traditional approaches in health care and improve outcomes at the individual, organizational, and societal levels.”\n\nUsing voluntary incentive mechanisms, Tunc’s research seeks to\n\nAlleviate the burden of organ scarcity, reduce the size of the transplant waiting list, improve the access of marginalized groups to transplants, and mitigate waitlist deaths\n\nPartner with Organ Procurement Organizations to expand organ availability and overall procurement\n\nReduce disparities in transplant access, especially for those at a significant disadvantage, including older patients and patients of color\n\nAlign individual actions with societal health goals, promote healthy behaviors, and improve long-term health outcomes especially among those most in need, such as individuals living with addiction or obesity\n\nAs part of the National Science Foundation’s support for educational outreach, the impacts of Tunc’s award will span from undergraduate engineering students to medical professionals, including a partnership with Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Virginia State University (VSU).\n\nHealth care providers can adjust their response to patients based on their willingness to adopt healthier behaviors. Tunc is hopeful this strategy will encourage people to adopt healthier habits while feeling they have choices in their decision making.\n\n“It’s crucial to design programs that actually motivate people to adopt healthier behaviors by considering all these individual differences in delay discounting, which explains why some people might not find long-term rewards as enticing. People that show addictive behavior, for example, are typically associated with higher delay discounting,” Tunc said. “This will enable researchers to find strategies that work for different groups.”\n\nThe future of health care systems\n\nTunc plans to use this research as an opportunity to educate others on how operations research and systems engineering and the use of voluntary incentive mechanisms can be beneficial for those working in the health care field, including short courses for medical students on implementing voluntary incentive mechanisms, and research education that will benefit undergraduate and graduate students at Virginia Tech and beyond.\n\n\"Our partnership with VSU is quite detailed, providing summer undergraduate research assistantship opportunities for VSU students at Virginia Tech, and offering an in-person opportunity for them to engage with groups in our department and elsewhere at the university,” Tunc said. “We hope we can engage students from multiple backgrounds and disciplines to participate, and encourage them to consider health care-related studies.”\n\nTunc’s grant-related research has informed his curriculum, including two new graduate level courses addressing health systems. Looking even further, Tunc hopes the research will impact policymakers from the top down while solving this complex global challenge.\n\n\"Beyond the direct educational interventions, the outreach activities associated with this research aim for policy change at the national level,” Tunc said. “Engaging with key stakeholders and policymakers ensures that the outcomes of this research are understood and potentially integrated into the national health care system.”",
      "# [On offense: Proactively personalizing medicine to optimize health](https://pharmacy.osu.edu/news/offense-proactively-personalizing-medicine-optimize-health)\nLaura Lile, MD, RPh, BS Pharm ’87, a dual-credentialed physician and clinical pharmacist, is nationally sought after for her proactive approach to preventative health and wellness – primarily using genomics.\n\n“I started down this path for my own family because we have extremely high cardiovascular and stroke risk,” Dr. Lile said. “I wanted to see my mom and dad be able to live a longer life, rather than losing them at 70 years old, which was common in my family history.”\n\nDr. Lile’s career has always been in the details.\n\nAfter her mom had a heart attack at a young age, Dr. Lile began looking into epigenetics to understand what she could do to improve her mom’s health. However, she wanted to go further – asking ‘what is the root cause of the disease or condition that patients are experiencing?’\n\nNow, through her practice, Lile Wellness Partners, Dr. Lile partners with patients to provide precise and comprehensive insights into their genetic makeup through IntellxxDNA™ testing. In addition, she uses bloodwork as the primary basis for following trend analysis of patients – both healthy and unhealthy. The Lile Wellness team can then tinker with medicine and supplement regimens to attain optimal health for their patients’ individual needs.\n\n“We practice offense medicine, not defense,” Dr. Lile said. “We believe in getting to the root cause of a disease state or condition. Rather than treating the condition only, we look at what may be causing it, such as lifestyle or genetic predispositions, to optimize a patient’s health.”\n\nGenomic testing allows patients to understand their genome and then dial in to very specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to see their risk factors for certain conditions and disease states. Pharmacists and physicians can then use that information to understand how to work around those SNPs. Using the gene variants, the health care team can modify risk using targeted medicine and supplements and then monitor the patient’s response through bloodwork.\n\n“We use these reports to analyze genes that are present in very low percentages in the population, less than 5% to 10%. We question why these genes still exist in someone's gene pool while the rest of the world has evolved and gotten rid of them” Dr. Lile said. “We then take a deep dive into the research to see what those genes have a higher risk of causing. In isolation, these gene variants are helpful to know, but without the IntellxxDNA™ tool and the evidence-based recommendations that it provides, it can be scary to know you carry a high-risk gene. These clinical decision tools remove that fear because now we can decipher how to override that part of your genome.”\n\nDr. Lile says that PharmDs are the perfect health care practitioners to perform the complex work of interpreting a genomic test, due to their expertise in the usage of medicine and accessibility to patients.\n\n“To use this tool effectively, you don’t need to prescribe medicine. You are guiding patients with a clinical tool to understand their genome and the why behind disease states like diabetes or depression. You can provide them with a powerful tool that can be refreshed on a routine basis, putting the pharmacist in an excellent position to be the patient’s health care advocate. Genomic tools can expand the role of the pharmacist.”\n\nHer strong belief that pharmacists can play a vital role in this process led Dr. Lile to invite four Ohio State PharmD students to an IntellxxDNA™ conference in the summer of 2023. She felt that it was her pharmacy training – not her medical training – that enabled her to understand the extremely complex reports she receives through genetic testing.\n\nOne of the students who attended the conference, Class of 2024 PharmD candidate, Kate Pollock, has continued her work with Dr. Lile and will join the Lile Wellness team upon her graduation in May 2024 as the first full-time PharmD in the clinical practice who will see patients and complete consults, rather than filling prescriptions.\n\nEven before tools like IntellxxDNA™, Dr. Lile had been using patients’ bloodwork markers to narrow in on improving health outcomes. However, the IntellxxDNA™ report, provides an immediate roadmap to optimal health outcomes without having to guess what’s going on with only some of the information.\n\n“I’ve spent years tweaking medications and supplements in patients to ensure that I see the responses in their blood work that I expect to see. While I’ve been doing this for years, I now have a clinical decision support tool that can get patients to optimal medication support on day one because we know exactly what their body needs.”\n\nDr. Lile and Pollock both attest to the benefits that their patients are seeing through this DNA-targeted precision-based medicine approach.\n\n“It has been great to meet with patients at their follow-up visits and hear how they’ve been able to participate in things like hiking or exercise that they weren’t able to before the testing,” Pollock said. “Patients are seeing progress on their health goals faster because we are able to tailor their body’s unique needs to them.”\n\nThey both also say the key to this type of intervention being used more widely is for pharmacists to continue to advocate for the profession.\n\n“The power of this tool can exponentially expand the role of pharmacists,” Dr. Lile said. “Pharmacists understand this complex medication and supplement-related data and use it to advocate for, and partner with, our patients. We need to identify the skill sets and value that we have as pharmacists to be a part of the solution. We’ve been doing it for years – pharmacists have always been the trusted healthcare professional, especially in rural communities that routinely experience a shortage of doctors. This is a natural progression for the profession of pharmacy.”",

This study aimed to evaluate the costs and consequences of deprescribing in frail older people living in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) in Australia.\n\nDesign: A within-trial cost-consequence analysis of a deprescribing intervention-Opti-Med. The Opti-Med double-blind randomized controlled trial of deprescribing included 3 groups: blinded control, blinded intervention, and an open intervention group.\n\nSetting and participants: Seventeen RACFs in Western Australia and New South Wales. Participants were 303 older people living in participating RACFs from March 2014 to February 2019.\n\nMethods: Analysis was conducted from the health sector perspective. Health economic outcomes assessed include cost saved from deprescribed medicines and the incremental quality-adjusted life-years. Costs were presented in 2022 Australian dollars.\n\nResults: The total cost of the Opti-Med intervention was $239.13 per participant. The costs saved through deprescribed medicines over 12 months after adjusting for mortality within the trial period was $328.90 per participant in the blinded intervention group and $164.00 per participant in the open intervention group. On average, the cost of the intervention was more than offset by the cost saved from deprescribed medicines. Extrapolating these findings to the Australian population suggests a potential net cost saving of about $1 to $16 million per annum for the health system nationally. The incremental quality-adjusted life-years were very similar across the 3 groups within the trial period.\n\nConclusions and implications: Deprescribing for frail older people living in RACFs can be a cost-saving intervention without reducing the quality of life. Systemwide implementation of deprescribing across RACFs in Australia has the potential to improve health care delivery through the cost savings, which could be reapplied to further optimize care within RACFs.",
      "# [Preconception planning for high-risk pregnancy by Katie Foutz, www.facebook.com on 2024-04-10](https://news.sanfordhealth.org/womens/preconception-planning-for-high-risk-pregnancy/)\nBefore you get pregnant, Maria Schmoll, M.D., wants you in your best health.\n\nLike customizing settings on your smartphone before you start to use it, you can reduce the risk of pregnancy complications by adjusting now.\n\nGranted, making changes to your health is more complicated than toggling on or off. Helping to manage those settings are OB/GYNs like Dr. Schmoll, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Sanford Maternal-Fetal Medicine in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. She sees patients with a range of health conditions from mild to severe.\n\n“The spectrum of things we optimize is very broad and very complicated at times,” Dr. Schmoll said. “And the extra component of that is there’s always two patients to consider, both Mom and Baby, and we’re trying to optimize health for both of them.”\n\nDr. Schmoll shares what contributes to high-risk pregnancy and what to do about it.\n\nWhat makes a pregnancy high risk?\n\nHigh-risk pregnancy means you or your baby has one or more complications that could affect your health, your baby’s health or likelihood for early delivery. Your pregnancy might be considered high-risk if you:\n\nAre age 17 or younger\n\nAre age 35 or older\n\nWere underweight or overweight before becoming pregnant\n\nAre pregnant with twins, triplets or other multiples\n\nHave had problems with previous pregnancies, including multiple miscarriages, preterm labor or having a child with a genetic problem or birth defect\n\nHave an existing chronic health problem, especially:\n\nDepression\n\nDiabetes\n\nHeart disease\n\nHigh blood pressure\n\nSeizure disorders\n\nCertain health issues that develop during pregnancy also can increase your risk of other conditions later in life.\n\nPlanning to lower your risks\n\nFor a safe and healthy pregnancy, you and your health care provider can work together to plan the steps for getting there. Dr. Schmoll says preconception health care can look like this:\n\n1. See your health care provider\n\nIf you’re thinking about starting a family and have any high-risk conditions, your primary care provider may recommend adding a maternal-fetal medicine specialist to your pregnancy care team.\n\n“We would recommend an MFM preconception consultation with any kind of maternal (complications) or history of fetal complications, just to talk about how to prevent more complications from developing, how to optimize pregnancy and how to have the healthiest pregnancy for those nine months and then postpartum as well,” said Dr. Schmoll.\n\n2. Review your medical conditions\n\nChronic health conditions can appear during pregnancy, become worse during pregnancy, and cause complications with your pregnancy.\n\nFor these reasons, Dr. Schmoll said it’s best to optimize your health at least six months before becoming pregnant. If you have chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, asthma, cystic fibrosis, lupus, heart or liver problems, or thyroid issues, this means you have them under control for half a year or more before attempting pregnancy.\n\n“When lupus is controlled or in remission at least six months prior to conception, the risk of complications is significantly lower,” she said.\n\nAlso consider any medications you’re taking, and ask your provider whether it’s safe to keep taking them during pregnancy.\n\n3. Learn your family history\n\nBirth defects or genetic disorders from either or both parents have the potential to affect your baby’s health.\n\nTo help determine your risk, you’ll answer some family health history questions at your preconception appointment.\n\nIf your health care providers identify a concern, they will discuss the diagnosis and other tests and consultations you’ll need. You also will meet with any additional specialists involved in your care, such as a genetic counselor. They’ll explain what they find and discuss treatments they recommend.\n\n4. Reach and maintain a healthy weight\n\nStarting pregnancy at a healthy weight can help reduce the risk of preeclampsia, pregnancy loss and cesarean delivery, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Current guidelines identify risk with a maternal body mass index of less than 18.5 or more than 30.\n\n“There are definitely people who are healthy with higher BMI, but we still need to use a number for our risk assessment, and we know that our risk goes up with that,” she said.\n\nAnother risk is developing gestational diabetes, a form of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. If you’re diagnosed with gestational diabetes, you’ll need to monitor your blood sugar level for the rest of your pregnancy.\n\nBeyond that, half of women who have gestational diabetes develop type 2 diabetes later in life, said Dr. Schmoll. She recommends every pregnant person be screened for diabetes in their third trimester, and everyone with gestational diabetes be screened again six weeks postpartum.\n\n5. Stop drinking alcohol, smoking and taking certain drugs\n\nDrinking and smoking before pregnancy increase your risk of preterm birth, pregnancy loss and birth defects. Dr. Schmoll recommends women stop all alcohol, smoking and drug use before becoming pregnant.\n\n“In that first trimester, there is significant organ development, and alcohol can affect that,” she said, citing the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. “And then throughout the remainder of their pregnancy, because it can affect neural development, ACOG makes a very strong stance that no amount of alcohol is safe in pregnancy.”\n\nSimilarly, doctors do not recommend using any illicit drugs if you’re planning to become pregnant – including methamphetamines, opioids, benzodiazepines and marijuana. However, some medications used in treatment for substance use disorders are safe and effective during pregnancy, Dr. Schmoll said.\n\nTalk to your primary care provider if you need help quitting.\n\n6. Take care of your mental health\n\nStress and worry are common even when you’re not trying to get pregnant. But letting stress build up before or during pregnancy can cause high blood pressure, low birth weight and higher risk of infection. So find ways to lower stress for your health and that of any future baby.\n\nWhat if it’s more than everyday stress? If you find negative thoughts and feelings are interfering with your daily life, it’s time to find help. Mental health conditions like anxiety and depression are treatable – and most psychiatric medications are safe to take during pregnancy, said Dr. Schmoll.\n\n“Treating Mom’s mental health is just as important (as physical health),” she said. “When it’s not treated, we do see an increase in risk of growth restriction, early delivery and other pregnancy complications.”\n\nHelp is available. If you’re thinking about suicide or self-harm, call or text the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988, chat at 988Lifeline.org, or call 211 now. Sanford Behavioral Health offers a variety of programs, so you can get the level of treatment you need.\n\nLearn more\n\nWhen is the best time to conceive?\n\nMother of triplets quits smoking for her babies and herself\n\nCarrier test shows what genes parents may pass to kids\n\n…"
