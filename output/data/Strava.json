So now it’s more steps to get to the editor you want than it was before they added this terrible feature. And now they’ve gone and moved the manual post/activity button off the home page. It took a long time to find where they hid it, and it makes zero sense why it has been moved. Oh and for this social network, you can’t be social and share links to articles, videos, or anything else you might like to share with your community. Strava is actively trying to lose subscribers.",

I’ve got on the thing I paid for. The lack of data on the information screen is laughable. I have no idea why you can’t see real time. Heart rate and/or elevation. The screen seems to constantly switch back between orienting to the north and then orienting towards the direction. You’re heading on the computer. There’s no way to lock out the screen. I find the social value of this app marginal and the idea of paying seven or eight dollars a month for what is really Peter pretty mediocre app. Makes no sense to me. I also annoyed by the fact that you have to turn on notifications for it to record heart monitor information using your Apple Watch.

For everything else, you have free alternatives that are arguably better.\n\nFor performance and workout analysis: if you have a Garmin device, you can use Garmin Connect. All other major brands will have their own cloud platform as well, for free (Polar, Suunto etc). If you want to keep things local, there's [GoldenCheetah](https://www.goldencheetah.org/). If you use your phone for tracking, then there's a huge selection of good apps to track your workouts, but I can't comment as I haven't tried many (I'm stuck to Garmin).\n\nTo create routes, there's [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/) (free in your own region) and [Bikemap](https://www.bikemap.net/). Even Google Maps nowadays will do a more-or-less decent job in developed countries. UPDATE: also [Ride with GPS](https://ridewithgps.com/).\n\nFinal option is to keep using Strava and extend it with 3rd party services. For workout analysis, there's [https://intervals.icu](https://intervals.icu) (consider donating!). For automations, calendar export, weather and Spotify data, component tracking and some other extra bits, there's [https://strautomator.com](https://strautomator.com) (disclaimed: I'm the dev). If you want to automate changes to activities using sensor data also from Garmin, there's [https://activityfix.com](https://activityfix.com). And the list goes on, you can find many more at [https://www.strava.com/apps](https://www.strava.com/apps).\n\n### Comment ID jah5ivg with +17 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-03-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/11eyn9p/ive_seen_a_lot_of_people_like_me_frustrated_at/jah5ivg/) (in reply to ID jagvfuh):\nSurprised ride with gps was left off rout creation.\n\n#### Comment ID jaifj61 with +6 score by [(igoramadas, Reddit, 2023-03-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/11eyn9p/ive_seen_a_lot_of_people_like_me_frustrated_at/jaifj61/) (in reply to ID jah5ivg):\nYou are 100% right.

But I think now the segments are. Aside from the exercise measurements and recordings, it is really the only key differing feature (Garmin Connect offers heaps of analytics).\n\nThe genius of Strava is getting people to create segments for them. Crowd sourced data in that way is clever by any company. To replicate that would be difficult, and an automated way would be possibly but difficult (some AI based scripting would be required to make logical segments).\n\nI personally am tending to use my Garmin Connect app more. I use the watch and I find the analytics pretty good. I think Garmin are really the ones to take advantage of Strava dropping the ball. By bettering Strava at its own game, they could perhaps pull people over to their hardware.\n\n### Comment ID jaia53p with +3 score by [(steester, Reddit, 2023-03-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/11eyn9p/ive_seen_a_lot_of_people_like_me_frustrated_at/jaia53p/) (in reply to ID jagvdka):\nI get the fun of segments, my friend is king of many of them.

It incorporates standard fitness tracking features like distance, elevation, and time, but goes further by infusing a light role-playing gaming (RPG) theme, complete with unique character development and elements like points, rewards, and course challenges that motivate users to remain active and achieve their fitness goals.\r  \n\r  \nYou can craft a unique narrative that transforms your running or cycling route into an exciting adventure.\r  \n\r  \nIn addition to these features, our app encourages user participation by allowing them to share their course creations, compete, or support one another through various courses. This fosters a dynamic and interactive fitness community.\r  \n\r  \nBy lightly gamifying fitness, we create a sense of enjoyment and purpose, turning exercise into an activity to look forward to and explore.\r  \n\r  \nOur app is tailored to individuals who are fitness-focused (not gamers) and seeking a more engaging and enjoyable way to track their outdoor activities. By merging social fitness and gaming we hope to create a community of adventure seekers who use our mobile app to explore the great outdoors while reaching their fitness goals.\r  \n\r  \n*/end-of-pitch*\r  \n\r  \nI believe there is a cross-section of us athletes that would enjoy having a little more colour and imagination with our fitness tracking tools.

What this means is that ALL your old performance data become inaccurate, so if you are basing training decisions on Strava numbers you are going to have a bad time.\n\nMore info on the issue here:\n\nhttps://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/203479564-Changing-FTP-changes-all-previous-training-score-data\n\nIt has been like this for years now, Strava are aware of it but do nothing to solve the problem. Your guess is as good as mine as to why they have not fixed this.\n\nTake these steps:\n\n1) Use alternative training software if you want accurate performance metrics.\n\n2) Let Strava know why you stopped using this part of their service.\n\nEdit: perhaps leave a simply \"+1 this\" comment on the above support link to help Strava get the message. \n\n## Comment ID dnp0yva with +22 score by [(Shannamalfarm, Reddit, 2017-09-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/73aalp/psa_do_not_use_strava_premium_to_track_tss_ctl/dnp0yva/) (in reply to ID 73aalp):\nI'll be honest, Strava CS is one of the worst I've dealt with.

I just use it to look at general trends in fitness and fatigue. I also use Strava Premium to look at time spent in zones and to do basic analysis of intervals. It does everything I want it to well enough. I haven't found a reason yet to pay twice as much for TP Premium.

The difference comes when you get fitter, and now update your FTP to, say, 300. Now Strava says \"actually, it looks like all your previous rides were much easier than you said they were, so we are going to reduce the TSS of each and every ride you've ever done\". It throws off all your other numbers, and renders the whole thing pointless.\n\n## Comment ID dnpqob5 with +9 score by [(Penn0r, Reddit, 2017-09-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/73aalp/psa_do_not_use_strava_premium_to_track_tss_ctl/dnpqob5/) (in reply to ID 73aalp):\nStrava are really disappointing in so many ways.

If the company wants to be profitable they need to capture the casual 5 mile a week jogger with a fit bit market.

They are terrible and Strava just accepts the data as-is. Yes, sure you see a track on top of a map.  That's just a graphic.  Numerically, the data is *very* junky with Strava doing nothing to even try to fit it.

The free versions are designed for people who either rarely use the app, just want to record occasional activities somewhere, or are looking to see if they like the platform. \n\nWhatever free alternative you find will either not be as good, or you'll find that, after a while, the same thing will start happening over there. \n\nIt's £8.99 a month (UK) or £54.99 a year (which breaks down to £4.58 a month) so it really isn't expensive if you're using all those features regularly.\n\n### Comment ID m2h6zvr with +15 score by [(dwisnia, Reddit, 2024-12-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/1hg1egy/best_free_alternative_to_strava/m2h6zvr/) (in reply to ID m2gnrll):\nThis.  \nIt's not possible to run an App for free and keep all the fancy features on track.\n\n#### Comment ID m2plgw5 with +3 score by [(warieka, Reddit, 2024-12-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/1hg1egy/best_free_alternative_to_strava/m2plgw5/) (in reply to ID m2h6zvr):\nAnd the more successful the platform is in terms of attracting users, the bigger the datasets get.

In this case, it sounds like OP just wants an app and uses their phone to track activity - this is great if it's the right thing for them, but we can't grumble when free things stop being free.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, if you are a regular user of Strava's premium features and value the community element that they provide, £55 a year is not an expensive cost. That's give or take four years worth of a new Garmin Forerunner 255 so it really is all down to what your need and your budget allow.\n\nBut free means people aren't getting paid.\n\n### Comment ID m2jryka with +1 score by [(JohnnyBroccoli, Reddit, 2024-12-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/1hg1egy/best_free_alternative_to_strava/m2jryka/) (in reply to ID m2gnrll):\nStrava is an absolute rip-off.

And even with the Varia - a lot of people don't realize it collects data on passing cars, including GPS coordinates and approaching speeds from the time it first picks up a vehicle until it passes you.\n\nI will say, though, that if you're a Peloton user, workouts will sync directly to Strava - but not Garmin Connect. Fortunately, there's a GREAT service called syncmyworkouts with takes care of all of that, never an issue, for $25/year. I do a Peloton ride, the moment Peloton's servers record it, it syncs with Garmin Connect (and pulls in a LOT of matching, detailed info), and then Garmin Connect uploads to Strava. This happens within 10 seconds of hitting 'stop' on the Peloton Bike or Tread Workouts.

Not “training” for anything per se.\n\n### Comment ID fs41cwa with +1 score by [(knumbknuts, Reddit, 2020-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/grkpux/strava_alternatives/fs41cwa/) (in reply to ID frzdmiu):\nI have 3 Garmin Devices.

Really great app and the route planning is very easy to use. However, saving a planned route requires a subscription. Not a bad thing in my opinion- as the creators have to make money somehow either through ads or subscriptions. Good apps don't stay free for long and I suspect this one will face the same dilemma as Strava.\n\n#### Comment ID fs0ryz7 with +1 score by [(Inquisitor_Whitemane, Reddit, 2020-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/grkpux/strava_alternatives/fs0ryz7/) (in reply to ID fs0jade):\nI like the data and mouseover feature on the pc version.

There's no other platform that can match Strava socially due to it having 50m subscribers, but worst case I could live without that. RideWithGPS doesn't appear to have proper segment comparison and PRs etc (or at least not in the free version). \n\nThe most annoying thing with the Strava changes is that it's now near-impossible to compare your own progress without paying. I don't really care about comparing to other people, but I do want to see (say) my top 5 times on a particular segment. Basically now, unless I get a PR, I've no idea how my relative performance was (yes, I know, the solution is to PR every time ;) ).\n\nI wouldn't mind paying so much (I've been a paying Strava user for years in the past) but having recently returned to cycling after a few years off, I now find that Strava's developers are too incompetent to properly support BT/Ant+ HRMs in the app, so have dropped support altogether. Call me picky, but if I'm going to pay £60p.a. for a fitness app and service, having to use another free app (such as Wahoo) to actually record my rides makes the whole thing a bit of a shitshow.\n\nIf they added back proper support for HRMs, then I'd probably re-subscribe.

Most of my riding friends use it--and because I do think it's a good program but from what I remember, RWGPS and MMR both include the important features in the free version.\n\n### Comment ID lfpdogi with +1 score by [(Biestie1, Reddit, 2024-07-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/1efzauy/any_good_strava_alternatives/lfpdogi/) (in reply to ID lfpbg9p):\nPeer pressure is right! It's the only reason I use strava. Functionally, I much prefer RWGPS. Wahoo uploads to both, so I have rides sent to both.\n\n#### Comment ID lfpecpt with +3 score by [(captainkickstand, Reddit, 2024-07-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/1efzauy/any_good_strava_alternatives/lfpecpt/) (in reply to ID lfpdogi):\nI just logged into my MMR account for the first time in who knows how long and it looks like it's synced with my Garmin--my recent rides are all there.",
      "# Post ID wfh8vl: Having an hard time switching from login with Apple ID to normal email with +6 score by [(giamboscaro, Reddit, 2022-08-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/wfh8vl/having_an_hard_time_switching_from_login_with/)\nHello,\n\nI signed up in Strada one upon a time with Login with Apple (and with the private relay email). That is totally ok but since I am using Strava a lot now I would like to switch to use my normal email, just in case I lose access to my Apple login (just one mistake and my account is gone).\n\nThis is where the trouble begins:\n\n* I need to change email, but I need to insert a password that I do not have.\n* I need to create a password, so I should try to reset my non existing password here [https://www.strava.com/account/recover](https://www.strava.com/account/recover)\n* I insert my Apple private relay email... nothing happens, I do not receive any reset password email (I do have email forwarding enabled).\n* I do receive all the other emails from Strava , marketing included. Why I do not get the only important email I need?\n* I already contacted the support but haven't got any answer in weeks.\n\nAny idea? Thank you\n\n## Comment ID kwzegpd with +4 score by [(Yuki4Phoenix, Reddit, 2024-03-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/wfh8vl/having_an_hard_time_switching_from_login_with/kwzegpd/) (in reply to ID wfh8vl):\nHello,\n\nI encountered difficulties receiving the email for setting a new password during previous attempts, it seems the issue may have been resolved, Here is my steps:\n\n1. Logged into Strava using my Apple ID and noted down the current email address, typically formatted as [XXX@privaterelay.appleid.com](mailto:XXX@privaterelay.appleid.com), where XXX represents a unique code consisting of several digits.\n\n2. Logged out of my Strava account.\n\n3. At the login screen, utilized the \"Forgot Password\" feature. Entered [XXX@privaterelay.appleid.com](mailto:XXX@privaterelay.appleid.com) to receive an email allowing me to set a new password, sent to my actual email address.\n\n4. Logged in using [XXX@privaterelay.appleid.com](mailto:XXX@privaterelay.appleid.com) and the newly set password, enabling me to change the email to the one associated with my Apple ID (i.e. my actual email address).\n\n5. Navigated to my iPhone > Settings > Apple ID > Sign in & Security > Sign in with Apple > Strava. Here, I confirmed the login information displayed as [XXX@privaterelay.appleid.com](mailto:XXX@privaterelay.appleid.com) and selected \"Stop using Apple ID\" to clear outdated data.\n\n6. Opened the Strava app on my iPhone, opting to log in with my Apple ID and ensuring not to conceal the email address.\n\n\n\nNow I can log in either \"with Apple ID\" or \"using email address and password\", hope this annoying issue is fully resolved.\n\n### Comment ID lnpw9wc with +1 score by [(rmedici30, Reddit, 2024-09-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/wfh8vl/having_an_hard_time_switching_from_login_with/lnpw9wc/) (in reply to ID kwzegpd):\nit worked!!! thanks so much!\n\n## Comment ID iitwuj6 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-08-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/wfh8vl/having_an_hard_time_switching_from_login_with/iitwuj6/) (in reply to ID wfh8vl):\nThat seems to be the right process to switch.

At that point I entered the random Apple ID email, and it automatically forwarded the password reset to the new “forwarded” email from the Apple settings, where I was able to setup a new password. Then, I was able to change my email in the Strava App using the new password.

I reset the password with a new one (actually the only one I ever had on Strava, since I was previously signing-in with Apple).  \nThen I went to the app and changed email (typing the new password), have been asked for confirmation via another email: this very first attempt failed, and I have been able to login again with Apple private relay email + new password (standard sign-in, but probably also Sign-in with Apple would have worked).\n\nI then changed the email again, and this time I received a green message \"Email confirmed\" when I clicked on the activation link.

I've never seen so many people go out on disability for burnout before. Everything looks shiny and supportive, but at the end of the day, they don't care, don't give you proper direction and then toss you when you don't meet expectations that were never really described.

While leadership is made up of nice people, they don't have the skills necessary to effectively lead the organization and get it out of this rut it's been in. There is a strong community of individuals with similar interests in fitness/sports at the company, but I feel like this can lead to an echo chamber effect sometimes. Over the course of my time there, it was disappointing to see several features fail to take off, and I believe the company would benefit from more reflection and analysis on what went wrong and how to improve moving forward. The multiple reorgs last year has led to a great deal of confusion among the employees - ways of working and processes are always changing. It also appears the company relies on verbal recognition as the primary form of award and not additional comp/bonuses when it comes to recognizing employees who go above and beyond.",

This is truly an organization that practices what it preaches in terms of diversity, work-life balance, and pay equality. I remember being so impressed in a company all-hands one day when the HR team announced a new initiative to examine gender pay equality within the company. This speaks volumes about the company, management, and the board to be dedicating resources to such a worthy issue. And this is just one of countless examples of Strava working to do the right thing. For me at a personal level, I always felt that my managers and colleagues were invested in my growth and development. While I did end up leaving Strava to pursue an education, there was always an open dialogue about where I wanted to go career-wise and folks did all they could to support that while I was there. We even had (free!) access to a full time career coach who was very influential in my choosing to move into development.",

We also have a great track record of promoting people from within. I'm sorry that wasn't your impression, and I'd welcome the chance to hear about your specific experience if you'd like to reach out.

The engineering team has been investing a lot of effort over the last year to become more nimble and is moving to much faster releases, which makes us more nimble.\r\n\r\nPerks wise, it's tough to beat. Many of them are oriented around an athletic life style. On site yoga, pro deals with most gear manufacturers, stipends for new equipment and races, and fantastic health insurance, to name a few. Plenty of time off to make sure you can decompress or train. A few provided meals a week and otherwise plenty of snacks. We don't have three meals a day like many tech companies, but it's not a major downer, the local food is good and we all still eat lunch together away from our desks.",

Despite such shoddy decisions they are still tasked with running the show. Their is no accountability. - The senior leadership culture is very defensive. They push a culture where nobody can express a critique about anything. The smallest negative opinion or feedback is punished, and the all hands is used to publically shame the entire company to ensure even anonymously nobody says anything negative about leadership. The anonymous forum is a joke - all the responses are platitudes and gas-lighting of employees, with the aim to ensure nobody submits any further feedback. They keep saying come have a live conversation but when people go have a live conversation they punish them and take away their good projects. - The leadership team has their head in the sand about the business. They only listen to someone with no experience, who is pushing his personal agenda but knows how to butter up the senior leaders. - The company made a huge deal about being anti-racist.

Leading by example can be very inspirational and create a healthy space to be your best self and do your best work. \n\nCompany gathers for weekly all-hands meetings (physically and virtually), where the leadership team provides a transparent view of the Company, its goals and future initiatives, and creates a space for questions. What companies still do this???\n\nStrava colleagues help to maintain a low stress environment, even when dealing with tight deadlines. The amount of mutual respect afforded to one another is remarkable. \n\nIf you live near one of the current office locations, there are weekly work out sessions, and the leadership team often joins!\n\nStrava has incredible benefits! Compensation aside (which is very competitive), Strava has very generous benefit plans, and in addition, offers annual gear stipends to all employees. Working for a Company at the center of connected fitness, it makes sense to have the best gear to document those journeys! One of the employee perks that cannot be overstated are the industry discounts. Just wow! \n\nThis is truly a great place to be!",

And deeply upsetting to the fairly diverse workforce they've built while adhering to those standards (awkwarddddddd).\n\nEven their idea of what Strava is and who it's for seems to change on the reg. I can't actually tell what we're for and what we're against, except that we seem to be for making money and against other people making more money. When you lack a \"why\", you go public all you want, but it's going to be absolutely brutal shortly thereafter.\n\nGood luck with career advancement, too.

But the company is plagued by a lack of direction, favoritism/bullying, incompetent leadership, and pervasive churn (firing, hiring, regular exits).\n\n*Lack of Direction: the focus changes every couple of months, rather than staying the course on critical business metrics and marching towards (and alongside) a vision.  Decisions are made regarding the strategy in tight-knit circles, and rarely communicated effectively to rank and file.  Change management is non-existent, leading to feelings of consistent thrash.\n\n*Incompetent leadership: While the new CEO has brought in more experienced leadership talent, some of those hires are purely rooted in nepotism and a handful of incredibly difficult legacy leaders remain.  In the marketing organization, there are leaders who openly gaslight rank and file employees, and treat those who ask too many questions or share dissenting opinions poorly.  The desire for these leaders to keep up appearances leads to shrouding under toxic positivity and what seems to be a tight-knit team (\"one team one dream\").\n\n*Favoritism/bullying: There is an in group and an out group at Strava.  If you don't fit yourself into the in group, there are consequences.  At best, this leads to opportunities for growth not being equitably applied.  There are many amazing people that have struggled to grasp at advancement, despite talent and impact.  At worst, you might experience bullying for not assimilating.\n\n*Pervasive churn: All of the above, as you may expected, has resulted in a number of exits from tenured employees.  In addition, Strava fires many leaders and rank and file employees regularly.",

Plenty of time off to make sure you can decompress or train. A few provided meals a week and otherwise plenty of snacks.

This is truly an organization that practices what it preaches in terms of diversity, work-life balance, and pay equality. I remember being so impressed in a company all-hands one day when the HR team announced a new initiative to examine gender pay equality within the company. This speaks volumes about the company, management, and the board to be dedicating resources to such a worthy issue. And this is just one of countless examples of Strava working to do the right thing. For me at a personal level, I always felt that my managers and colleagues were invested in my growth and development. While I did end up leaving Strava to pursue an education, there was always an open dialogue about where I wanted to go career-wise and folks did all they could to support that while I was there.

There is a strong community of individuals with similar interests in fitness/sports at the company, but I feel like this can lead to an echo chamber effect sometimes. Over the course of my time there, it was disappointing to see several features fail to take off, and I believe the company would benefit from more reflection and analysis on what went wrong and how to improve moving forward. The multiple reorgs last year has led to a great deal of confusion among the employees - ways of working and processes are always changing.

When you lack a \"why\", you go public all you want, but it's going to be absolutely brutal shortly thereafter.\n\nGood luck with career advancement, too.

But the company is plagued by a lack of direction, favoritism/bullying, incompetent leadership, and pervasive churn (firing, hiring, regular exits).\n\n*Lack of Direction: the focus changes every couple of months, rather than staying the course on critical business metrics and marching towards (and alongside) a vision.  Decisions are made regarding the strategy in tight-knit circles, and rarely communicated effectively to rank and file.  Change management is non-existent, leading to feelings of consistent thrash.\n\n*Incompetent leadership: While the new CEO has brought in more experienced leadership talent, some of those hires are purely rooted in nepotism and a handful of incredibly difficult legacy leaders remain.  In the marketing organization, there are leaders who openly gaslight rank and file employees, and treat those who ask too many questions or share dissenting opinions poorly.  The desire for these leaders to keep up appearances leads to shrouding under toxic positivity and what seems to be a tight-knit team (\"one team one dream\").\n\n*Favoritism/bullying: There is an in group and an out group at Strava.  If you don't fit yourself into the in group, there are consequences.  At best, this leads to opportunities for growth not being equitably applied.  There are many amazing people that have struggled to grasp at advancement, despite talent and impact.  At worst, you might experience bullying for not assimilating.\n\n*Pervasive churn: All of the above, as you may expected, has resulted in a number of exits from tenured employees.  In addition, Strava fires many leaders and rank and file employees regularly.",

      "# [How Hard Is It To Make Strava Art? on 2024-10-04](https://stories.strava.com/de/articles/how-hard-is-it-to-make-strava-art)\nYou may have seen Strava Art in your feed, on Strava Stories, or even in the news, but have you ever wondered how hard it is to create a Strava masterpiece? Howard Calvert decided to find out...\n\nYou’ve no doubt seen some Strava art, if not on your own Strava feed, in our Strava Stories section, or even in the news.\n\nIf you haven’t, Strava art is the term given to an activity on Strava that creates a piece of art using the GPS map of the activity.\n\nSometimes it may happen inadvertently, for example when someone comments that your 10K run route looks “a bit like an arrow”, but usually it’s a finely tuned and intricately planned masterpiece, sometimes months in the making.\n\nRELATED: 13 Pieces of Strava Art That Made Us... Wow\n\nOver the past few years, these Strava art designs have become so impressive they deserve to be framed and displayed in a gallery. Recent jaw-dropping examples include Nicolas Georgiou’s koi carp in London, Lenny Maughan's Road Runner and BigBird DPS Art’s mind-bending Impossible (Penrose) Triangle.\n\nSo I decided to take up the challenge of creating my own Strava art. How hard could it be?\n\nStrava Art: The Hard Miles\n\nAs it turns out, it’s exceedingly difficult and I tip my cap to the athletes out there creating artwork that simply astounds in its design. How do they do it?\n\nI asked Nico Georgiou for his advice on how he creates work like his koi carp, Mark Cavendish for the TdF, and his seriously impressive, 237 mile / 383km-long ‘Something for the Olympics’. Based in London, his day job is as a designer, something he says helps inform his Strava artwork.\n\n“With any Strava art design, I start by looking at a map,” he says. “Then I just go for it. I throw my first navigation point down, second point, third point, and then I expand lines and move them around on the map.\n\nRELATED: Love Strava Art? How to Create Your Own Masterpiece\n\n“For me, the drawing itself isn’t the problem — it’s trying to find the infrastructure in the roads and how to navigate things like rivers and train tracks.”\n\nIf Nico’s design needs to cross a river — and he regularly crosses the Thames in his art — he pauses the recording, rides to the nearest bridge, crosses, and then rides to where the drawing will continue before unpausing, meaning Strava’s GPS will draw a straight line across the river to that point. This results in him cycling farther than the distance shown on the final artwork — sometimes up to 70km more.\n\nOther big challenges are one-way systems, getting over footbridges, London parks closing at night, even unexpected police cordons or roads closed due to roadworks.\n\n“There’s a lot of problem-solving,” he says. “The first problem is the planning and drawing stage.” This usually takes him five or six hours of initial drawing which are then intricately refined over the course of a month. “I start with a point A and point B, and fill in the space between. For the koi carp, there were 666 navigation points.”\n\nThe next problem is the actual drawing of it on his bike. “Study the map and work out exactly what you need to make it work when riding it,” he advises. “If there’s a one-way street, for example, I know I’ll have to hop off my bike and walk along the sidewalk, or put my bike over my shoulder and cross a footbridge.”\n\nRELATED: Around the World in Strava Art\n\nHe also warns that having fully-charged batteries is of paramount importance, for both your GPS systems and your bike lights. The koi carp took him around 20 hours in total, starting at 3.30 am. “I navigate via my phone, and record the ride on my Garmin.”\n\nBut, for Nico, it’s this combined challenge of designing the artwork and then completing it, that draws him back in time and time again. “That and the headspace it provides,” he says, “even though my wife thinks I’m mad!”\n\nFor me, the drawing itself isn’t the problem — it’s trying to find the infrastructure in the roads and how to navigate things like rivers and train tracks.\n\nStrava Art: Expert Advice\n\nNico’s tips for beginners wanting to have a go at their own Strava art include:\n\nStick to freeform ideas. Try not to do anything too regimented.\n\nAvoid circles. You need to go a huge distance to create a decent circle.\n\n“Planning is an important part of creating a successful piece of art,” says Nico. “If you’re on a bike, do it in a town with plenty of roads to make it work. If you’re running, my suggestion is to use a large empty field and prep the route with markers as reference points.”\n\nUse a route-building website, such as Strava’s route planner.\n\nStart drawing! As Nico says, begin with two navigation points and take it from there. Be as creative as you like, or keep it simple, with something like a heart or a star if you want to build confidence.\n\nSave and export your ride to your device, whether it’s a watch or bike computer.\n\nStart riding or running, following the route you designed.\n\nTry not to take any wrong turns, as that could ruin the end product.\n\nEnjoy your activity, soak up the new sights. At the end, it’s the moment of truth — view the final art in Strava, and publish it on your feed.\n\nArt Attack\n\nWith that advice in mind, I head out on my own art-based expedition. I know I want to keep it local, and to start with run rather than cycle. But what to design? I experiment with something basic — a heart on a large, open field — but quickly give up when I figure it will inevitably end up resembling a large blob.\n\nThen, it hits me: what would be more appropriate than the kudos sign? A thumbs up for all Strava users. I scan my local area for anything that might string together to form the symbol… eventually, I draw what I think is a good enough thumbs up using the Strava route planner.\n\nGET PLANNING: Strava Routes and Heatmap: Find New Places to Go\n\nBut while I’m there I get a little more ambitious. These grids of new housing could easily form eyes… with a nose, mouth, whiskers… it’s a cat! But I can’t get the ears to work due to a canal and roads inaccessible due to military use. Maybe it looks more like the Grinch? When I attempt to run it, I suddenly change my mind and realize it could be Mario, so I have to adjust parts of it on the fly, keeping Nico’s advice to “not do anything too regimented” at the forefront of my mind.",
      "# [Activities missing in feed](https://communityhub.strava.com/general-chat-2/activities-missing-in-feed-3859)\nPage 1 / 1\n\nYesterday me feed order (which is set at chronological) suddenly changed putting activities (that I had already seen and given kudos) from the beginning of this month at the top and hiding most recent activities in the middle of the month. This has also happened to a friends. No amount of changing the feed order does anything to rectify this. Why has it happened?\n\nSame, on app and website, feed is just random... it's showing runs I did last month and nothing recent except latest\n\nIt looks like Strava made a change which switched the default ordering from latest activities to personalized, I've seen this reported in a few other places. You can change the preference from https://www.strava.com/settings/display under \"Feed Ordering\" or in the app under You > Gear Icon (top right) > Feed Ordering. See https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001183630-Feed-Ordering\n\nUnfortunately per Strava, the change will only impact new activities so it won't fix the issue right away.\n\nAny changes will apply only to new activities in your feed, so you may not notice a difference at first\n\nI might be an outlier, but I use Strava primarily to view my own activities. It seems that recently the activity feed filter on the website has changed, and it now only shows athletes I'm following by default. I have to select \"My Activities\" to see my own activities and, whenever I return to the activity feed page, it shows the athletes I'm following again.\n\nIn the past I could simply see ALL activities, mine and those I follow. Why has this option been deleted? I liked that.\n\nIt seems Strava is really emphasizing activities of other athletes over my own. I found the same to be true in the Android App. After I open it I have to press two buttons to view my own activities and none to view those of others. I only use the app for it's beacon feature, so I don't know if this was different in the past, nor do I really care. It is strange though.\n\nYes, Strava thinks of itself as a social platform, and I don't mind that, but having to dig around for the thing I'm really interested in seems strange. What's up with that?\n\nIf you scroll down a long way, do your own activities appear somewhen in the \"I'm following\" sections? Strava made some buggy changes to the activity sortings for users which used the chronological sorting of the feed. There is another thread with a similar problem: https://communityhub.strava.com/t5/campfire-chat/activities-missing-in-feed/td-p/41907\n\n@Jan_MantauYes, even though the feed is set to \"Following\", when I scroll back to before 1st of September I do see my own activities in the feed. I guess I'm not following myself anymore since the beginning of the month. 🙄\n\nExtra info: My \"Display Preferences\" > \"Feed Ordering\" is set as \"Latest Activities\", since the description of \"Personalized\" sounds awful.\n\nDid you need to change it to personalized or has it always been set to chronological?\n\nI'm asking because if you changed it, it only affects new activities so you won't see the change right away. It will display correctly from now on though.\n\nI did try several things so, yes, I might have changed it.\n\nI just did a very strenuous desk exercise of 11 seconds, uploaded it, and indeed it does now appear again in the \"Following\" feed.\n\nThis seems to solve the issue. I guess the \"Personalized\" feed is new and Strava pushes people to it? I now see that more people aren't happy with that.\n\nHi @Ajwaller,\n\nTo add some additional context to what @ActivityFix noted; we recently made a change in our model that surfaces older activities a user may have missed amongst newer activities. If you'd like to view your feed in chronological order please ensure your Feed Ordering setting is set to \"Latest Activities.\" If it's already set to \"Latest Activities,\" you can perform a reset by selecting \"Personalized\" and then switching back to \"Latest Activities.\"\n\nAfter changing the setting, the feed will not update immediately. Only activities uploaded after the setting change will follow the rules of the new setting.\n\nAdditionally, there may be some cases where an older activity appears at the top of the feed when an athlete you’re following makes an older activity publicly visible. We do this to make sure you see every activity from athletes you follow as soon as possible.\n\nFor additional information, see our help center article here: How the Strava feed works\n\nThis is a lesson to devs. Don’t fix what is not broken. Suddenly all my recent runs from my own feed disappeared as did all the people I follow. Changing settings did not fix….maybe moving forward but why mess with what works and what people use the platform for. If there is no reliable feed there is no Strava\n\nthere must be some issue with your model. i see completely different activities after every reload\n\nSo I did a ride two days ago and it uploaded automatically on completion through my phone. When I opened Strava (web) to admire my achievement it was nowhere to be seen. Eventually found it at about 200th in the feed, buried under entries from October and November in apparently random date order. I had never changed the ordering setting.\n\nI have tried changing the ordering setting backwards and forward several times, but it refuses to put my ride in the correct sequence - if anything it seems to make it worse.\n\nit drives me nuts when something that worked perfectly for years suddenly gets broken by an upgrade.\n\nStrava gods please fix it, even if it needs a one time button to set my entire history to chronological order! Randomization shouldn’t be an option, but now it seems to be the default.",
      "# [Activity not showing in activity feed or my activities](https://communityhub.strava.com/general-chat-2/activity-not-showing-in-activity-feed-or-my-activities-3665)\nWonder if someone can help. My ride has gone to Strava, it counts towards weekly total, it appeared in notifications. I can open it, named it but it does not show in feed or my activities! Both on app and on desk top. Very anoying as it was very good ride . I have also deleted the app and re-installed. Tried to delete the activity and uploded it throgh manual upload rather than through garmin connect. Don't know what else to do.\n\nHey @Harta,\n\nThanks for your post. I had our team take a look at your activity, they found that your activity from July 10 has an incorrect elapsed time.\n\nThe file contains time data that is out of sync with the rest of your activity. This can happen if the device is out of date, there is a GPS glitch that causes a jump in the time recorded, or the activity failed at some point.\n\nHere are a few options to try and resolve the issue:\n\n1. Crop your activity if the additional time is at the beginning or end of your activity: How to Crop Activities.\n\n2. Split and crop your activity: How to Split Activities. Keep in mind, this may only fix half of your activity. The other half may continue to have data errors.\n\n3. Manually fix any GPS time code errors:\n\nIf the activity was recorded on a device (Garmin, Wahoo, Bryton, etc.)www.fitfiletools.com - online fit file tools for files, including correcting Time Adjuster and Corrupt Time Fixer. We recommend trying both if one did not resolve the issue. Additional instructions can be found here:Fixing Time Code Errors\n\nDownload the TCX or GPX file and use a simple text edit program to \"Find and Replace\" the incorrect timestamp and replace it with the correct timestamp. Open the file on a desktop computer, it should open a simple text edit program. Using the same date format as the incorrect timestamp, type the correct date into the replace area to change it to the correct date. Make sure there are no additional timecode errors in the file by scrolling through the file and checking some of the dates. If so, repeat step 4. Save the file and try uploading directly to Strava:https://www.strava.com/upload/select\n\nUnfortunately, we are unable to manually adjust or correct these activities on our end. If you continue to run into these time errors please reach out to your device manufacturer directly.\n\nHi,\n\nSame issue here. I tried your suggestions but it did not work.\n\nCan I do anything else? My username is albertcuspi.\n\nThanks in advance",
      "# [Strava Unveils New Chapter of Accelerated Product Development at Brand's Flagship Event on 2024-05-16](https://press.strava.com/articles/strava-unveils-new-chapter-of-accelerated-product-development-at-brands)\nThe Company introduces increased product velocity, leveraging advancements in Artificial Intelligence, in service of its vision of a world connected through movement.\n\nLOS ANGELES (May 16, 2023) — Strava, the leading digital community for active people with more than 125 million athletes, today showcased its latest initiatives and product developments at its annual event, Camp Strava. With the theme of Progress, Together company leaders announced how the platform will empower its global community to make progress in the way they explore, move, and connect on Strava.\n\n“Strava is gaining momentum to realize our vision of a world connected through movement,” said Michael Martin, chief executive officer of Strava. “We are focused on two fundamental shifts to accelerate how we deliver value to 125 million people globally– building for women and leveraging Artificial Intelligence – which will unlock new community-and-partner-powered experiences across the platform.”\n\nA New Era of Product Velocity\n\nStrava, with new leaders at the helm, is ushering in its next era of product velocity. The company listened closely to feedback from its global community and announced three of the most requested features coming to the platform by the end of the year.\n\nThe first of these updates, AI-enabled Leaderboard Integrity, will harness machine learning to automatically flag irregular, improbable, or impossible activities recorded to the platform. Trained by millions of activities, this feature allows all users on Strava to play fair and have more fun.\n\nAdditionally, the company announced a new Family Plan Subscription, the sister of the company’s Student Plan. With Family Plan, it’s easier to make a fitness commitment with your community by sharing an annual subscription with up to three other people – friends, family, or fitness family. Launching in select countries this summer, with plans to roll out globally by the end of the year, Strava’s newest annual subscription option offers the best value for groups (up to four), with a discount off the regular subscription price for each member.\n\nStrava also implemented an updated design system, an initiative that is integral in driving a heightened pace of product innovation at the company. Through this work, Strava announced the launch of one of the company’s most requested features, Dark mode. Dark mode will improve the in-app experience for all users, reducing eye strain and improving accessibility while they record activity or scroll through the feed. Athletes can expect a rollout later this summer with options to keep their mobile settings always dark, always light, or match their device settings.\n\nCompany leaders highlighted several other features and updates to current products like Flyover, with its next iteration offering an overlay with activity stats and off-platform sharing capabilities. The overlay is available today for Strava subscribers and an off-platform sharing option will be released later this year.\n\nBuild for Her, Build for Many\n\nStudies show that women of all ages participate in sports at a far lower rate than men, and overall, despite wanting to be active, find less time to dedicate to an active lifestyle. As the company continues on its mission to motivate people to live their best active lives, building for women on the platform will ultimately serve everyone in the Strava community. Several new features and initiatives were announced as a part of this strategic focus, which includes:\n\nNight Heatmaps: Night Heatmaps show only activities between sundown and sunrise – so athletes can get an idea of which roads, trails, and paths are well-trafficked after hours. Since Night Heatmaps filter for after-hours routes, it can be a helpful tool for female athletes training before sunrise and after sunset.\n\nQuick Edit: For active women, having control over what is shared with the Strava community that cheers them on - like what time a run is logged - is important. Quick Edit makes it easier to make the most common edits - like activity name, and privacy settings so you can hide your start time, your map, or other workout stats.\n\nStrive for More®: The company announced a new phase of its Strive for More® initiative, created in 2022 to promote and support women in movement and sport. Today, Strava unveiled an official partnership with media company TOGETHXR to encourage more women to watch - and play - women’s sports. As part of the partnership, Strava will also donate $100,000 to the Alex Morgan Foundation, started by co-founder of TOGETHXR, Alex Morgan, to support their mission to help girls and women find confident paths forward in sports and life.\n\nAthlete Intelligence\n\nToday, Strava announced the start of an accelerated product roadmap, outlining how Strava will implement the latest technological enhancements in AI and machine learning, to transform the athlete experience.\n\nOne key advancement to the platform includes the company’s latest development, Athlete Intelligence. Strava is introducing its beta AI-powered feature which turns each subscriber’s training data into an easily digestible summary that contextualizes their accomplishments and fitness goals. Unlike other AI-powered training services, Strava connects with thousands of devices, wearables, and fitness apps, so an athlete’s insights can consider their entire fitness story across multiple sports and modalities.\n\nThe features shared at Camp Strava will be released on a rolling basis through the end of the year. To view the full list of product releases and further details, visit www.press.strava.com.\n\nFor more information on Strava, to create a free account, or to start a free subscription trial visit www.strava.com.\n\nAbout Strava\n\nStrava is the leading digital community for active people with more than 125 million athletes, in more than 190 countries.

      "# [Tool to create Segments has changed](https://communityhub.strava.com/strava-features-chat-5/tool-to-create-segments-has-changed-8711)\nYes, the missing automatic switch to the the start or end point when outside the visible map is annyoing. I can’t see an offset between the markers and the red line though.\n\nThere is another bug in the new segment creation: You can’t really edit an existing segment anymore. If you alter the start and end point slightly you get the error message on saving that the new (sic!) segment can’t be created because it’s too similar to an existing one.\n\nSo a new version of the Segment creation tool was launched about 3 weeks ago. After about a day it was reverted to the previous design. In the last few days there has been what looks like another attempt to launch a new version of the tool. The problem about not being able to edit old Segments seems to have been resolved, but the issues about not centering the map when switching between start and end points still remains, as does the slight mismatch between the indicated position of the start/end points and the red/blue colours. Can the re-centering of the map please be reinstated ?\n\nSo the new version of the Segment creation tool has been running for a week or so. The good news is that I am no longer getting the annoying “Strava is unavailable” messages. It seems the new tool has been designed to make it harder to create a Segment that is similar to an existing one. I understand that Strava want to limit the number of Segments but this change causes some frustration. For example, I created a Segment a while ago and I noticed recently that the GPS data is not as good as it should be (I think it was recorded on my watch due to a phone problem). I want to create a new Segment that would be quite similar to the old one, with the difference that a section of it would be on a road instead of 20 metres to the side (and hence more people would have attempted it). The problem is that the new tool doesn’t let me save an improved version of the Segment unless I flag it as “Private”, which seems pointless. I suppose I could delete the old, flawed Segment and create the new one, but I want to ensure the new Segment works as intended (such as no corrupted leaderboard due to short efforts by people joining after the start or leaving before the finish) before deleting the old version. If there was a problem with the new Segment I don’t know how I could recreate the imperfect older one.\n\nAnother couple of niggles about the new tool:\n\nIt only seems to suggest a single existing Segment that might be similar whereas the earlier tool might suggest multiple ones (including ones in the reverse direction). I preferred the older version as I got to learn about nearby Segments that I may otherwise not have seen\n\nThe map doesn’t auto-centre when switching between start and end points (unlike the previous version). This is quite annoying, especially if I zoom in tighty to accuratley posiion things.",

      "# [Updates on FATMAP integration?](https://communityhub.strava.com/general-chat-2/updates-on-fatmap-integration-7742)\nPage 1 / 2\n\nIs anyone else missing the functionality of Fatmap this winter? I’m back to using Google Earth for an oblique view of mountain terrain, but I really loved the the elevation and avalanche overlays in Fatmap. Can some of the original Fatmap features be incorporated into the Strava map?\n\nHi- I’m so confused - I can’t see ANY trace of Fatmap on the Strava app. How are you seeing all the winter slopes etc? Thanks for your help!!, L\n\nHi @LINIC\n\nNone of Fatmap's features have been migrated to Strava yet. I think someone from the staff should give us an update on when we can expect any news because, as of now, there’s absolutely no trace of Fatmap on Strava.\n\nHa! Strava have marked this conversation as ‘solved’. WTF\n\nOk cheers.\n\nBusiness as usual for a 1.5 Billion dollar company then.\n\nWhat a joke!\n\nHi L,\n\nI’ve already canceled my subscription. I recommend checking out apps like Caltopo or Outmap. Outmap (iOS/Android) has features like slope angle, slope aspect, avalanche risk, flat areas, and excellent 3D maps. I think it’s the closest alternative to Fatmap we currently have for winter sports.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nCheers!\n\nHi ​@npinchak\n\nafter the takeover of FATMAP, STRAVA shut down FATMAP and wants to gradually integrate the features of FATMAP into SRAVA. Obviously not everything has been transferred yet.\n\nMaybe this information will help?\n\nhttps://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/26949702911117-What-to-Expect-as-FATMAP-Transitions-to-Strava\n\nhttps://press.strava.com/articles/fatmap-is-transitioning-to-strava\n\nThanks ​@cy-linder, that’s good to know. Still, I wonder when more features will be added. It’s been over a year since we’ve known Fatmap would be taken down. The 3D imagery on the desktop map is pretty good, but it’s harder to navigate without arrow keys. And missing the awesome Fatmap overlays... Just hope they will bring these features back.\n\n@strava @scout any news? Really?\n\nWinter is here again but sadly this year when I went to open my favourite winter app I see it’s gone, and for some reason I’m sent to my sometimes useful summer app.\n\nbut sadly none of the features I relied on are here, no backcountry routes no resort trails nothing I relied on each winter (sometimes to get myself out of some trickery situations).\n\nI would have thought with such an acquisition they’d get at least the minimum features across but no but I guess it wasn’t planned so well..\n\nI guess we all will question the reason for the acquisition, could it be the users? I doubt it, I’m positive all 1.5M FATMAP users already have Strava installed. The tech? More likely, but they seem to have failed on that one. This year like me those who didn’t have a Strava subscription will be forced to try the free month, where like me they’ll remember that Strava is not a backcountry app and like me they’ll cancel before the trail ends. Next season will we be back? I doubt it. Good opportunity for the competition to FATMAP to up their game and take on a share of those users I guess. For me now it’s back to good old GPS topo maps for my planning, good skills never die even when a great app makes them redundant (for a time).\n\nAnyway alas FATMAP I’ll miss you, a great app with a great name. You’ll be remembered.\n\nBring back fatmap! Why would you deprecate and shut down the app before integrating the features into Strava? The company is hurting its backcountry users.\n\nI also miss FATMAP so much and feel completely disappointed with this acquisition, as it seems that a great backcountry app has been killed.\n\nI know that integrations take some time, but is this going to happen at any time? If not, byebye Strava and thanks for nothing.\n\nI subscribed to Strava only for Fatmap’s features so if there won’t be Fatmap functionality or at least clear time schedule I won’t renew Strava subscription. I don’t need yet another Facebook.\n\nMap layers need to be added for slope angle/avalanche, aspect, distance, flats, gradient, snow depth, snow accumulation. These are crucial for backcountry travel (specifically skiing) and were available in fatmap and should be migrated over into strava since fatmap was shut down.\n\nMigrate fatmap public ski routes to strava - backcountry, alpine skiing, more. These routes were a wonderful knowledgebase of routes, beta, and more for all over the world. It would be amazing to have them available in strava now that fatmap is shut down.\n\nI subscribed to Strava only for Fatmap’s features so if there won’t be Fatmap functionality or at least clear time schedule I won’t renew Strava subscription. I don’t need yet another Facebook.\n\nNo wonder you don’t want to renew your subscription. Strava hasn’t kept its word. There isn’t a single FatMap feature integrated, and they don’t engage with the community. It’s disappointing.\n\nI subscribed to Strava only for Fatmap’s features so if there won’t be Fatmap functionality or at least clear time schedule I won’t renew Strava subscription.

Strava is in fact solely for running, swimming and biking. Any other sport is just an appendix to them.\n\nBRING BACK FATMAP. Tfe functionality and information detail of the Strava maps are severely lacking.\n\nHello and thanks to everyone who has posted here. We appreciate your enthusiasm for these features.\n\nWe are in the process of integrating FATMAP's 3D map - including winter satellite maps and terrain tools - into the map screens within the Strava app and website. FATMAP's 3D map is already visible in Strava's Flyover feature, and now includes the ability to pause and modify flight speed. You can also see FATMAP's 3D map images in the Strava feed.\n\nIn addition, FATMAP route content, excluding user-generated content, will be moved to Strava. We are currently working on the new home for these routes so they can be used seamlessly within the Strava app.\n\nCertain FATMAP features will not be available in Strava in time for the Northern Hemisphere winter including waypoints, personal guidebooks, national Topo maps (including IGN and OS maps), offline map downloads of the FATMAP map and live snow and piste information. We are exploring adding these and similar features to Strava in the future.\n\nHello and thanks to everyone who has posted here.

FATMAP's 3D map is already visible in Strava's Flyover feature, and now includes the ability to pause and modify flight speed. You can also see FATMAP's 3D map images in the Strava feed.\n\nIn addition, FATMAP route content, excluding user-generated content, will be moved to Strava. We are currently working on the new home for these routes so they can be used seamlessly within the Strava app.\n\nCertain FATMAP features will not be available in Strava in time for the Northern Hemisphere winter including waypoints, personal guidebooks, national Topo maps (including IGN and OS maps), offline map downloads of the FATMAP map and live snow and piste information. We are exploring adding these and similar features to Strava in the future.\n\nI appreciate your response, but I believe it is late and insufficient.\n\nFlyover: It contributes absolutely nothing to the FatMap community. We need a planning tool, not a social tool to see what we have done.\n\nCertain FATMAP features will not be available in Strava in time for the Northern Hemisphere winter: At the very least, it is reckless to have removed a safety tool for the community in the middle of winter without having a minimum alternative.\n\nI’m sorry to be so harsh, but it’s unfortunate how this has been handled by Strava. For the record, I was previously a subscriber of both Strava and FatMap. I didn’t mind paying for two applications. Now, I have canceled my Strava subscription and subscribed to GaiaGPS.\n\nI just discovered today that, after acquiring fatmaps, Strava went ahead and essentially deleted it. The ENTIRE PURPOSE of fatmaps was to provide, literal, life-saving information for navigating backcountry terrain in the winter, where slope gradient IS AN ENTIRELY CRITICAL element of safe travel. Not only do strava maps and route making capabilities LACK THE GRADIENT OVERLAY, they don’t even allow you to make off-piste routes - you can only draw on existing, “known” trails. The claim of acquiring fatmaps “to make outdoor travel more accessible” is absolute bull until these features are reinstated.\n\nSTRAVA: I implore you to hire someone who participates in backcountry winter sports - skiing, boarding, snowmobiling, whatever - who understands JUST HOW CRITICAL IT IS TO BE ABLE TO SEE SLOPE GRADIENT WHEN PLANNING A BACKCOUNTRY ROUTE who will reinstate this feature or just bring the fatmaps app back. Otherwise it seems inevitable that I will be foregoing my strava subscription for something like OnX backcountry.\n\nHello and thanks to everyone who has posted here.

I think prioritizing offline map area downloads (including routes) should be important. Most backcountry zones I enter have no cell service...so I NEED to be able to have offline maps for safe travel in the backcountry (avoiding avalanche terrain, seeing different routes, etc). Piste info would also be nice to have, as when skiing at a new ski resort can be confusing and this can help with navigation (but not nearly as important as offline maps, and all of the map layers that fatmap had like aspect, slope angle, etc).\n\nAlso - fatmap should not have been shut down until these were released.\n\nI am commenting on this thread, as I have also mentioned this issue on several different threads.\n\nAgain I’d like to echo the thoughts of several individuals in this group. Strava have bought and removed an essential tool from the community. Why on earth did they close the app down if they hadn’t sorted the integration first into Strava.\n\nThis has left the mountaineering sports community without an essential tool during the winter, and the least they can do is pay subscribers an estimation on the project timeline. If there is no timeline, then I’d question if they’re ever going to employ this at all to customers.\n\nKind regards - one very disappointment customer",
      "# [Strava Introduces Proprietary Map Rendering Engine on 2025-03-06](https://press.strava.com/articles/strava-introduces-proprietary-map-rendering-engine)\nLatest update provides a deeper level of detail for Strava users\n\nSAN FRANCISCO – March 6, 2025 – Strava, the app for active people, unveiled a major upgrade to its maps, integrating its own proprietary mapping engine into its app. Now with lifelike 3D terrain, detailed satellite imagery, and new maps layers for planning winter and trail activities, Strava’s maps deliver additional value for users looking to stay active outdoors year round.\n\nPowered by the company’s proprietary Map Rendering Engine (MRE), Strava’s maps now utilize technology from FATMAP, an outdoor adventure platform acquired in 2022.

      "# [Strava API Agreement Update by mcneese.chad on 2024-11-18](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/strava-api-agreement-update/98191)\nYou might’ve seen this from Strava in your email just now:\n\nㅤ\n\nWe’re reaching out to inform you of a change that affects how third-party apps connected to Strava may display certain information. This update, effective on November 11th, is part of our commitment to privacy and transparency across all connected apps and devices.\n\nㅤ\n\n…which includes this condition:\n\nData Use Limitations:\n\nWe’re updating our terms to explicitly prohibit third parties from using any data obtained via Strava’s API in artificial intelligence models or other similar applications.\n\nㅤ\n\nWhich platforms is that going to effect?\n\nReading between the lines … strava saying “it’s OUR data and we need to protect our most valuable asset”.\n\nThe only third party I share strava with is intervals.icu. But IMO would make sense to start sharing the primary source of data (garmin, wahoo, etc) with third parties rather than strava, even though strava is usually the easiest.\n\nI do this stuff for a living and hope this isn’t the start of a larger trend. Like I’m not going to be happy if Garmin pulls something like this. Unfortunately pervasive in my industry though (healthcare).\n\nIf that is indeed true I suppose I can always do:\n\nWahoo → TR and Zwift → TR (if that is indeed coming soon) for my indoor, unstructured rides.\n\nI understand why Strava is doing this but I feel like this could be the user’s choice on a third party integration basis.\n\nIt sure sounds like it, so I guess the best thing to do in this case is cut out the middleman and sync directly from Wahoo/Garmin to TrainerRoad (and intervals.icu) and… that pretty much kills my primary use case for Strava\n\nAlso, lol:\n\nNote: Per our Community Guidelines and Guidelines to Ideas, posts requesting or attempting to have Strava revert business decisions will not be permitted.\n\nOkay, then. I’ll vote with my wallet instead.\n\nIt is definitely rich that Strava has implemented AI itself using data ** checks notes ** obtained via third party APIs but is apparently forbidding the reciprocation.\n\nI am still in “benefit of the doubt” mode as I haven’t read the full legalese but lol.\n\nI do wonder if they are aware of this they will rightfully stay quiet for the time being. If they unsure what this means for their integration with Strava it is usually best in the company’s interest to stay quiet until they get full clarify on the legal implications, if any.\n\nThat is part of the reason I skipped a tag for now.\n\nBut if this is so far reaching, I would have hoped that Strava might give a heads up to those potentially affected 3rd parties. Or not… and they are blindsiding them the same us average people?\n\nIt sounds like a very strong move.\n\nThe sort of thing that only a company that is exceptionally confident of its position in the market would do.\n\nI wonder if Strava would be classed as a monopolist and, if so, if this would be an abuse of its market power?\n\nWe have the post above from David (Intervals.icu) and I saw another on Reddit where developers shared that they were notified by Strava earlier than we (the users) were.\n\nThanks for sharing the Intervals.icu update, as I had asked this exact question. I believe this change means coaches will no longer be able to view our activities on Intervals/TrainingPeaks. If that’s the case, the only use I have for Strava is the heat maps, and I’m sure not paying their annual rate for that.\n\nFor what it’s worth, I have an API application and only got the notice about the changes two hours ago. Granted, it’s a very small application so maybe I didn’t merit any more advance warning (the only user is me, I’m using the API to show my own data on my own website, which it seems I’m not allowed to do anymore )",
      "# [Strava Bans User for Running in North Korea by Ray Maker on 2025-03-12](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/03/strava-bans-user-for-running-in-north-korea.html)\nOn the list of quirky things, I didn’t have “Strava bans user for running in North Korea” on my bingo card today. But here we are. I’ve just spent the last hour going down the rabbit hole that is the Pyongyang Marathon (in North Korea), and it turns out – it’s a thing. As in, a thing that outsiders come and run. There’s even an official website for it. In fact, there’s been 31 editions of it. And over 1,000 foreigners run in it and the affiliated running events each year, including plenty of diplomats such as the then British Ambassador to North Korea.\n\nThe event has been happening for decades, but that’s actually not what caused this person to have their account banned. Rather, they were there for a trip because they are working on their doctorate about North Korea, and while there, went on a run, then came home (to a different country). After which, they uploaded their run to Garmin Connect, which then synced it to Strava. Finally, Strava then sent them a note that their account was being terminated.\n\nBut wait, it gets better!\n\nLast month, a person did a treadmill run where their virtual run location was set as North Korea. Guess what? Their account too was banned. Albeit, after contacting support, the company eventually reinstated it – but clearly Strava has some pretty funky rules in place around uploading activities related to North Korea. What’s strange here though is that it’s not simply hiding the workout, but straight-up deleting the account. Which obviously, makes no sense – so, I did what I do best: Dig into it.\n\n!!!Now, before we go too far, let’s just take two seconds to do a quick explainer on North Korea travel. In a nutshell, there are tour operators who operate trips to North Korea. Depending on your citizenship, it is actually not illegal for people to go to North Korea within one of those tour operator trips. These trips are *highly* controlled, and generally speaking give outsiders a positive impression of North Korea, generally only featuring the lives of elite families. They would rightly be called propaganda. Equally though, they are one of the few windows into society in North Korea, polished and skewed as it might be. Perhaps the best balance of a video I’ve seen recently was this one published just 10 days ago, with over 5 million views. Again, I’m definitely not here to endorse you (or me) going to North Korea!!!\n\nInstead, I’m here to illuminate an absolutely bonkers automated system that Strava has, backed by an even more unexplainable policy.\n\nHow Strava Handles Activities in North Korea:\n\nThat now-Strava-deleted-user lives outside North Korea, and is studying North Korea for her doctorate. In addition, she also has a YouTube channel (and other social media bits), that are a blend of ultra running + insights into North Korea from an outsider’s perspective. Again, I’m definitely not here to advocate going to North Korea. Nor am I here to judge her and her study of North Korea. After all, the study of all countries and cultures is important to understanding them. Instead, I’m here to ‘free the GPS track’. It’s like the ‘free the nipple’, only less exciting.\n\nWhile on one of these aforementioned tourist trips, she went on a run, and recorded that with her GPS watch (specifically, a Garmin Forerunner 265 by the looks of it). Note that while technically North Korea has historically prohibited standalone GPS devices, it appears that these days they turn a blind eye to watches, given most smartwatches have GPS in them today. Same goes for phones (which are permitted for tourism trips).\n\nOf course, there’s no publicly accessible internet in North Korea, thus the person waited till they got home to upload the workout. After uploading the workout, they received a notice that their account had been terminated, for violating Strava’s Terms and Conditions. Here’s a screenshot of that Instagram story:\n\nStrava’s response seemed like a pretty harsh reaction, but then I did a bit more digging. Just over a month ago, a user on Reddit reported doing a treadmill run. Their iFit-equipped treadmill enabled them to do runs pretty much anywhere Google Maps has mapping information, which does indeed include North Korea. It can essentially recreate a route anywhere. And they did just that, after which it uploaded to Strava. Following which, Strava banned the user.\n\nNow, following the ban, the user reached out to Strava Support, and was able to get the account un-terminated, after they determined the user didn’t actually go to North Korea.\n\nFiguring Out The Rules:\n\nBut still, none of this was holding water, logical or otherwise. Why on earth was Strava banning users for uploading random runs in North Korea. After all, the company is more than happy to publish data from military officers and other government officials on top-secret plans. Certainly, North Korea would be the opposite of top secret. (Nitpickers Corner: I’m fully aware that in these cases, Strava is actually not at fault here, but rather individuals not understanding that posting data to a social media site is…umm…social.)\n\nIn any case, regarding the North Korea case, I asked Strava what was up.\n\nAnd here’s what they had to say:\n\n“Thanks for the chance to provide clarity on this.\n\nIn accordance with mandatory US sanctions and export controls, which prohibit the offering of online services to North Korea, Strava does not allow users to post activities occurring there. This is also directly stated in our Terms of Service (“[users] may not use or export the Content in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations”). When a user uploads activity with GPS data indicating North Korea, the activity is hidden, the account is automatically suspended, and the user is notified. If the user believes the block was made in error—e.g., as a result of faulty GPS data—they are able to reach out to our team and, if confirmed, have their account restored.”\n\nHmm.\n\nAfter their initial response, I volleyed back that this didn’t really make much sense. The user in question wasn’t accessing Strava from North Korea (thus, Strava isn’t providing services to North Korea). Further, the user created the run in North Korea on Garmin hardware, not Strava hardware. And then uploaded it to Strava once they left the country. Again, Strava isn’t available in North Korea, so this isn’t an issue. Said differently, nobody is violating US export controls here, since the company (Strava) isn’t providing a service to North Korea.\n\nIn fact, countless people upload videos to YouTube that were shot in North Korea on all manner of devices/phones. Just as numerous mainstream media entities have done so for decades. These tourism trips are hardly new. Again, propaganda-driven, but hardly new. The Pyongyang Marathon has been going on for years. Likewise, you can upload a photo taken within North Korea to Facebook, or Instagram, or any other platform you choose. Further, Garmin does not have any sort of ban or prohibition on a user going for a run with a Garmin watch anywhere on this planet. That’s your device, to do as you wish, and uploading it to Garmin Connect won’t get you banned either.\n\nIf there was a real basis for legal concern, there wouldn’t be thousands upon thousands of videos uploaded to YouTube that were shot in North Korea. I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that Google has better lawyers than Strava. Likewise, Facebook and Apple. Because Apple doesn’t terminate your iCloud account because it contains your iPhone photos taken in North Korea (yes, I checked that too).\n\nIn any event, after I volleyed back to Strava again, asking why the company seems to be taking a much more restrictive stance than any other company on this planet that I can find, they said:\n\n“We can’t speak for other companies and how they approach compliance with export controls. Strava’s controls are based on feedback from the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, and we take a broad, zero-tolerance approach.”\n\nAgain, per above, that doesn’t really explain why Strava seems to be (seemingly incorrectly) interpreting how this law works. But nonetheless, since that’s the way Strava is handling it, I asked if there was a list of other countries that fall into this camp (so users could be aware), which they responded with:\n\n“As noted previously, Strava’s approach is based on feedback from OFAC.”\n\nSo, no?\n\nOk, let’s go on a field trip then to the Treasury Department’s website and see if we can find the list from OFAC. I’ll save you a crap-ton of bumbling around. The main page you need is this one. Or, maybe this one. This first lists *MASSIVE* PDF files full of every possible sanction type. There are dozens of countries on the list. But the level of sanctions varies by country. For example, China is on the list, but it does not prohibit regular business transactions. As are plenty of countries in Africa and the Middle East, again, which don’t prohibit most business transactions. The best I could easily discern was a list from Oregon State University, that seems to indicate it’s: Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria.\n\nFiguring out exactly which list Strava is using to decide would be very helpful. But alas, I already asked that. Which begs the question: Why can’t they provide it, and state it simply, on some support site? Further, why on earth would a user be banned, as opposed to having their activity hidden? If Strava’s goal is to hide that data source, simply hiding the activity would solve that.\n\nIn fact, years ago, Strava did actually show data from North Korea. There’s an old Reddit thread on it. And there was even a Segment at one point. None seem to exist today.\n\nIn any event, that completes my rabbit hole for the day. You’re welcome.\n\nFOUND THIS POST USEFUL?

      "# [Fitness app Strava gives away location of Biden, Trump and other leaders, French newspaper says by Sylvie Corbet, breaking news. twitter, apnews.com, sylvie-corbet on 2024-10-28](https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-macron-bodyguards-security-strava-0a48afca09c7aa74d703e72833dcaf72)\nPARIS (AP) — An investigation by French newspaper Le Monde found that the highly confidential movements of U.S. President Joe Biden, presidential rivals Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, and other world leaders can be easily tracked online through a fitness app that their bodyguards use.\n\nBut the U.S. Secret Service told the newspaper that it doesn’t believe the protection it provides was in any way compromised.\n\nLe Monde found that some U.S. Secret Service agents use the Strava fitness app, including in recent weeks after two assassination attempts on Trump, in a video investigation released in French and in English. Strava is a fitness tracking app primarily used by runners and cyclists to record their activities and share their workouts with a community.\n\nLe Monde also found Strava users among the security staff for French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin. In one example, Le Monde traced the Strava movements of Macron’s bodyguards to determine that the French leader spent a weekend in the Normandy seaside resort of Honfleur in 2021. The trip was meant to be private and wasn’t listed on the president’s official agenda.\n\nLe Monde said the whereabouts of Melania Trump and Jill Biden could also be pinpointed by tracking their bodyguards’ Strava profiles.\n\nIn a statement to Le Monde, the U.S. Secret Service said its staff aren’t allowed to use personal electronic devices while on duty during protective assignments but “we do not prohibit an employee’s personal use of social media off-duty.”\n\n“Affected personnel has been notified,” it said. “We will review this information to determine if any additional training or guidance is required.”\n\n“We do not assess that there were any impacts to protective operations or threats to any protectees,” it added. Locations “are regularly disclosed as part of public schedule releases.”\n\nIn another example, Le Monde reported that a U.S. Secret Service agent’s Strava profile revealed the location of a hotel where Biden subsequently stayed in San Francisco for high-stakes talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2023. A few hours before Biden’s arrival, the agent went jogging from the hotel, using Strava which traced his route, the newspaper found.\n\nThe newspaper’s journalists say they identified 26 U.S. agents, 12 members of the French GSPR, the Security Group of the Presidency of the Republic, and six members of the Russian FSO, or Federal Protection Service, all of them in charge of presidential security, who had public accounts on Strava and were therefore communicating their movements online, including during professional trips. Le Monde did not identify the bodyguards by name for security reasons.\n\nIt said movements trackable on Strava could lead to security breaches, especially when security agents travel in advance to places like hotels where leaders then stay and hold meetings.\n\nMacron’s office said Monday that the consequences of the issues reported by Le Monde “are very slight and in no way affect the security of the President of the Republic.”\n\nLocal authorities are aware of Macron’s movements ahead of time and the places where Macron is staying are always fully secure, “so the risk is non-existent,” the statement said.\n\n“A reminder was nevertheless issued to agents by the chief of staff asking them not to use this app,” Macron’s office added.\n\nThe Harris campaign deferred comment on the security issue to federal officials. In response to questions posed to the Trump campaign, a spokesperson for the Republican National Committee repeated some of its criticisms of the Biden administration but did not address the vulnerability or how the campaign has responded.\n\nThe security risks associated with fitness apps show the need for better regulations on how tech companies can use consumer data, according to Ibrahim Baggili, a computer scientist and professor of cybersecurity at Louisiana State University.\n\nBaggili’s research has exposed how bad actors could use fitness app data to track potential victims — creating risks for stalking, robbery and other crimes.\n\nConsumers often grant app developers the right to use or sell their data when they agree to the terms of service, Baggili said.\n\n“Companies love our data, and we love the product, so we give away the data for free,” he said. “The government really needs to start cracking down on how data can be used and how long it can be retained.”\n\nIdentifying the presidential bodyguards — some of them using their full name on Strava — could also help in finding other details about their personal addresses, their families, their movements, and photos they posted on various social media, all of which could possibly be used to put pressure on them for malicious purposes, the report stressed.\n\n___\n\nAP reporter David Klepper contributed from Washington.",
      "# [Strava closes the gates to sharing fitness data with other apps](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42190341)\nUnless Strava is aiming to get a GDPR fine, users can probably still access their data. What Strava is shutting down isn't data access, but rather their method for accessing the data without user intervention.\n\nYou can download a data export and upload it to whatever service you wish. You're not necessarily entitled to make Strava do that data sharing for you, though.\n\nIt's still a pretty shitty move from Strava's side. I wonder what AI model they're training (or other companies were training) with the data now no longer easily accessible through the API.\n\n> rather their method for accessing the data without user intervention.\n\nNonsense. The user did intervene: with an OAuth 2 flow. The user doesn't intervene with every API call or database query a data export makes.\n\nWhat you're really getting at is \"the user can't authorize someone else to look at their data\". That's like a hospital saying your spouse can't get an update on your condition in the emergency room because you didn't hand the documents to them yourself.\n\nIt's certainly well within their right to change this rule and cut off API access, but I suspect a lot of people are going to tell them to go screw themselves.\n\nIs it just me, or does The Verge's headline seem a bit clickbaity and not reflective of the actual change?\n\n> \"Strava closes the gates to sharing fitness data with other apps\"\n\nThis doesn't seem to be the case, with the quote they cite:\n\nEffective November 11, the updated API agreement introduces three key changes that provide Strava users with greater control, security, and a consistent experience: Stronger Privacy Standards: Third-party apps may now only display a user’s Strava activity data to that specific user. Users will continue to have access to their personal Strava data across apps connected to our platform, though there may be differences in how this data appears. Data Use Limitations: Our terms now explicitly prohibit third parties from using any data obtained via Strava’s API in artificial intelligence models or similar applications. Protecting the Strava Experience: Additional terms have been added to protect Strava’s unique look and feel and functionality, helping users easily distinguish between Strava and third-party platforms.\n\nThe restrictions seem to be:\n\n- You can only show that user's data to that user.\n\n- You can't use user's data to train AI models.\n\nSo it seems that you can still share your data to other platforms.\n\nOr am I missing something?\n\n> Training AI Models:\n\n> We believe in the potential of AI to transform the athlete experience–whether it’s delivering more personalized insights to help you reach your goals, generating route or training recommendations, or countless other possibilities. But innovation in this space must be handled responsibly and with a firm focus on user control. As part of our generative AI features, we are committed to implementing thoughtful solutions that prioritize user control and the ability to opt out.\n\n> Third-party developers may not take such a deliberate approach to training AI models and as a result, we believe the best decision for the platform and for users is to prohibit the use of data extracted from Strava users in this manner.\n\nTranslation: 'We want to consume your data for AI and we don't want anyone else to consume your data with AI. AI for me, not for thee. We own you and your data.'\n\nObviously they're totally enlightened and don't fit into that secondary category, as judged by themselves, and thus they deserve an exception to the policy. It's just all their potential competitors who might act unethically. Trust them, they know what's best for you and are only harming you because they care for you.\n\nI would be worried about the continued preservation of my data in the hands of someone who abuses it and uses such archetypical abuser tropes to justify their abuse.",

For brands with lower budgets, we recommend starting with Clubs to grow an organic community.\n\nWe intentionally do not support any third party tracking to protect the privacy of our users and the authenticity of their experience. We do however, allow (and encourage) advertisers to customize tracking parameters in their reward URL – for athletes to claim a reward when completing a challenge.",

While it faces challenges related to user feedback and integration of new features, its commitment to connecting athletes and fostering a supportive environment remains strong.
