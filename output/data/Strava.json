  "summary_markdown": "# About Strava\n\nStrava, Inc. is a prominent social fitness platform founded on January 1, 2009. It is headquartered in San Francisco, California, and has grown to become a central hub for athletes worldwide, particularly those involved in running and cycling. As of 2023, Strava has over 100 million users, making it one of the most popular fitness apps globally [(DCRainmaker, 2024-11-19)](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/11/stravas-changes-to-kill-off-apps.html). The company operates primarily in the B2C space, catering to a diverse audience of athletes ranging from casual exercisers to serious competitors. Strava generates revenue through premium subscriptions and partnerships with businesses that engage with the athletic community via challenges and sponsored segments.\n\nStrava's primary product is its mobile and web application, which allows users to track their athletic activities, connect with friends, and participate in community challenges. The platform supports various sports, including running, cycling, hiking, and swimming, and offers features like GPS tracking, performance analytics, and social networking capabilities. Strava also provides a Developer API, enabling third-party developers to create applications that enhance the Strava experience [(Strava Developers, 2024)](https://developers.strava.com/).\n\nThe company has raised a total of $151 million in funding, with significant rounds including $110 million in November 2020 [(Crunchbase, 2024)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/strava). While the exact number of employees is not publicly disclosed, estimates suggest a workforce of around 200-300 employees [(DCRainmaker, 2024-11-19)](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/11/stravas-changes-to-kill-off-apps.html).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nDetails about Strava's leadership team are not extensively covered in the provided content. However, the company's CEO has been vocal about Strava's commitment to user privacy and data control, emphasizing the importance of maintaining user trust while navigating the complexities of data privacy and third-party integrations [(DCRainmaker, 2024-11-19)](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/11/stravas-changes-to-kill-off-apps.html).\n\n# News\n\n## API and Privacy Changes\n\nOn November 19, 2024, Strava announced significant updates to its API agreement, restricting third-party applications from displaying Strava activity data to other users and limiting the use of Strava data in AI models and analytics. This move aims to enhance user privacy and control but has raised concerns among developers about the viability of their applications [(DCRainmaker, 2024-11-19)](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/11/stravas-changes-to-kill-off-apps.html). Additionally, Strava has stopped sharing user data with third parties, a change that has sparked discussions within the community [(Matthew Sholtz, 2024-11-20)](https://www.androidpolice.com/strava-wont-share-data-and-doesnt-want-you-discussing-the-change/).\n\n## New Features and Developments\n\n1. **Strava Art**: This creative feature allows users to create artwork using GPS data from their activities. It has gained popularity, with users planning intricate routes to form recognizable shapes and designs [(Strava Stories, 2024-10-04)](https://stories.strava.com/nl/articles/how-hard-is-it-to-make-strava-art).\n\n2. **AI Coach and Insights**: Strava has introduced an AI-powered feature that provides instant insights into workout data. This feature, known as Athlete Intelligence, is currently available in beta and has received attention for its unique and sometimes humorous comments [(Leo Schwartz, 2024-10-11)](https://fortune.com/2024/10/11/strava-app-artificial-intelligence-fitness-athletic-memes/); [(Stephen Warwick, 2024-10-03)](https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/strava-s-powerful-ai-insights-are-here-athlete-intelligence-is-now-available-in-beta).\n\n3. **Quick Edit Feature**: Launched in September 2024, this feature allows users to seamlessly personalize their activities immediately after syncing them, giving users more control over what they share [(Matt Kollat, 2024-09-25)](https://www.t3.com/active/youre-sharing-your-workouts-all-wrong-stravas-quick-edit-can-fix-that); [(Karandeep Singh Oberoi, 2024-09-25)](https://www.androidpolice.com/new-strava-update-bringing-quick-edit-activities/).\n\n## User Feedback\n\nRecent changes to the activity feed, which now prioritize activities from followed athletes over the user's own activities, have led to confusion and frustration among users who prefer a chronological view of their workouts [(Strava Community Hub, 2024-11-18)](https://communityhub.strava.com/general-chat-2/activities-missing-in-feed-3859). Additionally, the API changes have sparked significant backlash from developers and users who feel that these restrictions may limit the app's functionality and integration with other services [(Intervals.icu, 2024-11-16)](cache://intervals.icu/17).\n\n## Partnerships and Integrations\n\nStrava continues to expand its ecosystem through partnerships with various fitness and health applications. Notably, the integration with Jefit has been highlighted, although users have experienced some syncing issues [(Strava Community Hub, 2024-11-18)](https://communityhub.strava.com/developers-api-7/partner-integration-with-jefit-1966).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nStrava remains a dominant player in the fitness app market, with a robust user base and innovative features like Strava Art. However, recent changes to its API and user feedback indicate a need for the company to balance privacy concerns with the functionality that users and developers expect. As Strava continues to evolve, its ability to maintain user trust while fostering a vibrant ecosystem of third-party applications will be crucial for its long-term success.",

In general, I really really like the app. It’s relatively easy to use and I’m happy that it’s able to get your heart rate from the Apple Watch.\n\nThat said it’s missing two key features. The first feature is the fact that you cannot, use the Apple Watch and the iPhone together at the same time. The reason I find this important is even though I may look on my Apple Watch most of the time while I’m hiking or any other activity and my phone is away, there are times when I’m hiking that I would like to see the map with the track I’m following and progress on the map itself. The only way to make this possible if you only use your phone without the watch at all. Even if you start your track on your phone, you cannot view the current status on the watch. i’m not saying to put the map on the Apple Watch as that would be quite difficult to navigate but in times you get lost and you want to see where you are on the map that’s impossible if you start it from the Apple Watch. Note, This is much different than syncing the Apple Watch and the iphone app. That sync has been seamless, but that sync can only occur after the fact which doesn’t help if your off the track and want to get back on the track. \n\nThe other aspect of the Apple Watch that is missing is the fact that you cannot rearrange the stats as you viewing them. I like seeing my mileage and it seems to be the smallest thing on the screen, and you have no way to edit the data view screen on the  watch. Slight inconvenience but if you need glasses to read, I would want to put the things that are important in larger text and up toward top. \n\nNote all that said the app is excellent and works as designed.

      "# Almost 5 stars but Apple Watch Integration seems like an afterthought, 4 stars [(Puzzle0227, Apple App Store, 2024-09-14)](https://apple/11724411163)\ni’ve been using this app for sometime now. In general, I really really like the app. It’s relatively easy to use and I’m happy that it’s able to get your heart rate from the Apple Watch.\n\nThat said it’s missing two key features. The first feature is the fact that you cannot, use the Apple Watch and the iPhone together at the same time. The reason I find this important is even though I may look on my Apple Watch most of the time while I’m hiking or any other activity and my phone is away, there are times when I’m hiking that I would like to see the map with the track I’m following and progress on the map itself. The only way to make this possible if you only use your phone without the watch at all. Even if you start your track on your phone, you cannot view the current status on the watch. i’m not saying to put the map on the Apple Watch as that would be quite difficult to navigate but in times you get lost and you want to see where you are on the map that’s impossible if you start it from the Apple Watch. Note, This is much different than syncing the Apple Watch and the iphone app. That sync has been seamless, but that sync can only occur after the fact which doesn’t help if your off the track and want to get back on the track. \n\nThe other aspect of the Apple Watch that is missing is the fact that you cannot rearrange the stats as you viewing them. I like seeing my mileage and it seems to be the smallest thing on the screen, and you have no way to edit the data view screen on the  watch. Slight inconvenience but if you need glasses to read, I would want to put the things that are important in larger text and up toward top. \n\nNote all that said the app is excellent and works as designed. If it had the features above, it would be a clear five star app for me",

Here's the quick summary:\n\n**– Non-paying users will no longer see the full leaderboard:** They’ll only see the top 10 times (all + Top 10 women), you won’t see your friends anymore, nor clubs or weight/age groups  \n**– Strava is removing the leaderboard from all 3rd party apps:** If your using one of the 44,000 3rd party apps out there to do anything with Segments, this likely just broke it. Only devices like those from Garmin/Wahoo/Hammerhead/etc that have Strava Live Segments can display that for paying members.  \n**– Non-paying users will no longer get the web route builder**: If you want to build routes, you’ll need to use another platform.\n\nIn addition to those substantial ones, there’s also one lesser removal:\n\n**– Non-paying users will not longer get ‘matched rides/runs’ feature:** This will [automatically compare runs/rides](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216918597-Matched-Runs) on the same route from a pace/speed standpoint.\n\n### Comment ID fr1no8z with +165 score by [(togetthere, Reddit, 2020-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/gm5fa5/strava_cuts_off_leaderboard_for_free_users/fr1no8z/) (in reply to ID fr1kw8j):\nI feel the same way as your conclusion.\n\nIn the end, you drive subscriptions by creating new value in the subscription tier, not by eliminating things from the free tier. \n\nThe latter will just make customers upset.\n\n#### Comment ID fr1x9a7 with +62 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/gm5fa5/strava_cuts_off_leaderboard_for_free_users/fr1x9a7/) (in reply to ID fr1no8z):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID fr1qc3k with +78 score by [(NoMoreFun4u, Reddit, 2020-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/gm5fa5/strava_cuts_off_leaderboard_for_free_users/fr1qc3k/) (in reply to ID fr1no8z):\nI agree however, from my point of view, Strava gave too much away from the start.

Even as simple as only allowing you to build 3 route a month and a maximum of 5 so free users can see the feature and see the value of it.\n\nHow they can justify locking a user out of a leader board for a segment they created I don't know that will just piss off the very content creators on the platform.

We bike for fun, when we can. For me segments are fun to look at after a ride but the reality is that many cyclists riding that day are not riding on Strava so your leader board rank is limited to Strava users only. I also find that many segments are very selective with just portions of a climb rather than the whole climb, or some anonymous 1/4 mile stretch of road. Obviously created by someone to do an effort to try to get a top ten.\n\n## Comment ID fr1sofm with +46 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/gm5fa5/strava_cuts_off_leaderboard_for_free_users/fr1sofm/) (in reply to ID gm5fa5):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID fr1y3a2 with +10 score by [(kevinmorice, Reddit, 2020-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/gm5fa5/strava_cuts_off_leaderboard_for_free_users/fr1y3a2/) (in reply to ID fr1sofm):\nWeren't leaderboards by weight, and by age, still behind the paywall anyway?\n\n#### Comment ID fr202j0 with +11 score by [(Pristine-Woodpecker, Reddit, 2020-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/gm5fa5/strava_cuts_off_leaderboard_for_free_users/fr202j0/) (in reply to ID fr1y3a2):\nYes, but he says he had premium and that was one of the only useful features.\n\n### Comment ID fr3fjc8 with +3 score by [(Whosbackthere, Reddit, 2020-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/gm5fa5/strava_cuts_off_leaderboard_for_free_users/fr3fjc8/) (in reply to ID fr1sofm):\nThe heat map might be the best feature in all of Strava. I can't believe it's buried in the \"settings\" and not a straight button on the header bar. Also think the personal heat map is worthless. That as a premium feature is stupid. Why would I want to pay Strava to show me the places I have been in the world as a bunch of lines on google maps?\n\nI don't think I have ever used the all time leaderboard as I'll never be on it, and the weight and age leaderboards don't show me anything of value. Why would I use - or worse, pay - for the right to see other people in those cohorts if they did not provide any additional value?\n\nI liked to see something I could actually compete with. Why is this so hard? Zwift somehow can gamify, why couldn't Strava with all the additional time and resources? Why can't I compete on a level playing field somehow? Is a handicap system like the one used in golf so hard to ask for? \n\nI don't particularly care that some pro can crush a segment, destroy every KOM, and forever make it unattainable for mortals. It's of no value to me to see how I don't compare. Give me something that makes it worthwhile to continue working at it against others. Don't show me I am in spot number 11,467 on the all-time, 4,598 on the year, and 450 on the day (and then further make me pay to see how I am number 200 in my weight class)\n\n## Comment ID fr20e3y with +31 score by [(Koda_chrome, Reddit, 2020-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/gm5fa5/strava_cuts_off_leaderboard_for_free_users/fr20e3y/) (in reply to ID gm5fa5):\nSo... now it's just Instagram with maps for free users?\n\n### Comment ID fr29lbn with +5 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/gm5fa5/strava_cuts_off_leaderboard_for_free_users/fr29lbn/) (in reply to ID fr20e3y):\nI'm stealing this.

I was specifically interested in personal heatmap. You know, this beautiful red-to-white heat on dark map, which is default for global heatmap? Well, personal one was dull reddish on light gray map, and it was just still, low-res image. I was really underwhelmed. Any third-party heatmap service, even the simplest one like statshunters.com is much better.\n\nOther features were, well, not worth it for me, too. I'm not competitive, I can't care less about \"training packs\" and \"relative effort\" and some \"threshold\" bla bla bla. I ride for recreation, not to train or compete in Tour de France. I use strava as a database for all my rides, all the rides with my friends, and to see where my friends rode without me. I like segments but I mostly compared my own efforts and me vs friends. I don't care about how fast can strangers of my age or weight can go.\n\nI cancelled trial before it ended. So, now I still don't have anything useful to pay for. I lost not that much, just can't compare myself with friends, and can't build routes. Well, I can live without it. As long as strava allows to upload gpx files, show them to me, and maybe give them to third-party apps for features that are not on strava, I'm good. But in no way I'm gonna pay that much for *that*.\n\n## Comment ID fr2jkpu with +5 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/gm5fa5/strava_cuts_off_leaderboard_for_free_users/fr2jkpu/) (in reply to ID gm5fa5):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID fr2m1nw with +6 score by [(Pristine-Woodpecker, Reddit, 2020-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/gm5fa5/strava_cuts_off_leaderboard_for_free_users/fr2m1nw/) (in reply to ID fr2jkpu):\n> then pay for it.

The only reason I got one for cycling is as a GPS map that I can follow, not to track the activity, the sensor integration and value you get in a bundle also made it worth while, but that is all Garmin, or whoever else, not Strava. Strava tried to make it own exercise equipment and royally screwed it up, and that is the reality of Strava's management, a team of devs got there first in 2010-2012, and then in the last half decade the management has done absolutely jack all. \n\nI actually thought they were making progress over the last few months.

The email was incredibly misleading whilst reading it. I got the  impression that in light of the current crisis, they were going to make Premium temporarily free which I thought would have been excellent move.

If you're stuck with the Garmin/Wahoo/other device ecosystem, you're just driving users apart. Strava does a good job bringing everyone together in the most dominating social media platform, in the social media age. \n\nI'm like most on this discussion in that there is very little enticing me to go premium. I tried it and there really isn't much beyond what is free that I need from them. So much of the premium content is available elsewhere, ie. training programs found on trainingpeaks or even the garmin connect software. Worse still, I did not find the effort analysis very good or accurate.\n\nI would put out a big activity to get a moderate to high effort rating, but then go to a shorter workout with more focused and high intensity, and it would be considered a straight low effort rating. That doesn't help me hone my effort levels. Some of these algorithms would have been nice if they were aligned with training plans and efforts. Combine this with the sort of training plans you can buy and execute from trainingpeaks, and you'd have a great premium product and definitely worth paying top dollar for. \n\nFor the moment, I can just follow a calendar and see the result. Why would I pay for the premium if it was incorrect or just didn't tell me something I didn't already know or could ascertain myself?\n\n### Comment ID fr44h88 with +1 score by [(E-Pluribus-Tobin, Reddit, 2020-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/gm5fa5/strava_cuts_off_leaderboard_for_free_users/fr44h88/) (in reply to ID fr3eh3p):\nYou just described why they needed to make leaderboards a premium feature: it’s one of strava’s main draws and they needed to give people a reason to spend money.\n\n## Comment ID fr3xekr with +3 score by [(MrSp33dy123, Reddit, 2020-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/gm5fa5/strava_cuts_off_leaderboard_for_free_users/fr3xekr/) (in reply to ID gm5fa5):\nThe free mode of Strava is really important I think, and it absolutely is a valid business model - look at Google. I agree that Strava should work on more advanced features for dedicated athletes, but isn't that going to be a very small market? As I see it, for me at least who casually cycles 3-4 hours a week as a hobby and for fitness, I think Premium costs too much. I believe there's a way to select from three different packs, but on the app I can't see anything about that, I think this should be more broadly available. This represents Strava's other weakness which is the lack of parity in desktop and mobile features. As Instagram has proved, mobile is the primary market here. I want to get all the features I'm paying for on my phone.\n\nHonestly I don't know what the solution is, but it seems like Strava needs to focus on being more broadly appealing. I don't know many people that use it, and I think it'd benefit from tighter integration with other social media such as FB.\n\n### Comment ID fr41izy with +1 score by [(Pristine-Woodpecker, Reddit, 2020-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/gm5fa5/strava_cuts_off_leaderboard_for_free_users/fr41izy/) (in reply to ID fr3xekr):\nThey lost the separate subscriptions a while ago.\n\n## Comment ID fr3ynkj with +3 score by [(Exxtraa, Reddit, 2020-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/gm5fa5/strava_cuts_off_leaderboard_for_free_users/fr3ynkj/) (in reply to ID gm5fa5):\nI can certainly agree it’s not an expensive cost.

I think I stopped paying when they release Summit, which meant I'd have been paying the same amount for less features (I was on the fence about stopping the subscription anyway).\n\nA few things stick out to me from this news:\n\n1. Segment leaderboards is probably the standout feature of Strava. People use Strava because their cycling friends use it, the reason a lot of people started using Strava is because of segments. Sticking segment leaderboards behind a paywall will likely mean people who can't afford/don't want to subscribe will start using a different platform. If you have friends on a different platform, then you might start looking at those platforms too.\n2. If segment leaderboards are expensive to maintain (I'm assuming this translates as server processing power) then they could reduce that by cutting so much of the clutter. The amount of identical segments I see is incredible. When creating a segment, they should identify how similar it is to another and only allow it's creation if it's below a threshold. Also, give users the ability to flag duplicate segments or some functionality to propose name changes - I feel a lot of duplicates are created because the original segment for a hill is something like 'mickeys hill sprint', so somebody else creates a new segment with an appropriate name.\n3. Whats the big issue with advertisements for free users? Of course, people will complain about them being on their feed but, like with other social media platforms, it's an incentive to subscribe to remove the advertisements and a case of you don't have a right to complain if you're not paying.\n4. I had a look at subscription cost. £4 per month average in the UK if you pay upfront for a year, or £6.99 paying monthly. That seems like too much of a difference to me and will really put people off subscribing monthly if they can't afford to pay annually.\n\nI feel like Strava have missed the ball here. They've focused on trying to force people to subscribe to gain revenue, instead of reducing costs and gaining revenue from other sources to maintain the core features for a free tier userbase.\n\n## Comment ID fr4mmja with +2 score by [(onesojourner, Reddit, 2020-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/gm5fa5/strava_cuts_off_leaderboard_for_free_users/fr4mmja/) (in reply to ID gm5fa5):\nThe average bike computer should last 5-10 years.

If you're a frequent Strava user that loves leaderboards and you get a lot of value from them, then why shouldn't you pay for that? It's only $5/mo. If that's too much, you get to still use this awesome fitness tracking app with a huge social network, just without leaderboards. \n\nIt's easy to be an armchair business expert. For every segment you create, Strava has to match against their 4 billion activities they've stored and then maintain leaderboards across tens of billions of segment matches. That is stupid expensive. Why is wrong to charge for the value that brings to users? And if your argument is \"but it used to be free and now it's gone and that's why I'm mad,\" why don't you imagine if all of Strava went away instead of just leaderboards. \n\nSure there are tons of features they could build that people have been requesting for a while. Maybe if more users supported them by paying, they could invest in building these things for users rather than trying to create ancillary revenue models based on brand partnerships or selling data. [From their founders letter](https://www.strava.com/subscription/from-our-founders), it seems like their plan going forward is to invest more in user features like they've been doing for all of 2020 so far. \n\nAlso, Strava is giving every single user access to all these features for free for 60 days. So there's plenty of time for you all to decide if these features are worth the cost of ***$5/mo***.\n\n### Comment ID fr2ebak with +7 score by [(thedoublecyclist, Reddit, 2020-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/gm5fa5/strava_cuts_off_leaderboard_for_free_users/fr2ebak/) (in reply to ID fr2736o):\n>Strava is a business and needs to survive.\n\nThere current model is what got them here.

If you think capitalism is the solution, consider this: No one else is going to spend the ton of money required to build and run an app equivalent to Strava unless they are certain they can find a way to get people to spend money on it.

Heart rate seems to be weighted more than duration. Therefore, if you do the EXACT same route at the EXACT same pace twice, and the second time you have increased your (real) fitness, you would actually expect your heart rate to be lower the second time. But strava will give you a lower score for the second run/ride. If you continue to do this, your score will decrease overall.\n\nNow I understand that there is some consideration of decreasing returns - i.e. if I really just do exactly the same run on the same route with the same pace all the time, eventually I will be challenging myself less and less, and instead of increasing my fitness I will switch to just maintaining, and maybe eventually I actually will decrease (?). But the fact that strava's fitness score would immediately consider this a decrease seems like a fundamental mistake.\n\nFeel free to let me know where I've gone wrong because I really like strava and metrics and I would love to be wrong.\n\n### Comment ID i1tfw1f with +5 score by [(MillennialHOA, Reddit, 2022-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/tkuc24/what_is_a_good_strava_fitness_score_my_thoughts/i1tfw1f/) (in reply to ID i1td7wq):\nIndividually this is right, each subsequent effort with a lower heart rate would individually impact the score less. That said, it is a reported as a cumulative score, so if I did exactly the same event starting from a score base of 0 my cumulative score would go up each day, say by 5, then 4, etc; so ultimately 5>9>12>14>15>16 assuming no rest. I think this actually does account for the concept of diminishing returns well.\n\nAgreed it is more tied to training load than actual fitness, but it's not quite as fundamentally misleading as implied.  I don't think it is a great measure of understanding total fitness, but it can be good as a baseline against which you can measure overall training. I've found it useful as a prompt to understand when I've really dropped from \"taking it easy\" to \"not doing much at all\" as well as a arbitrary number to show that I've been putting in a lot of effort (even if it is not yet reflected in a race effort, time, etc.)\n\n#### Comment ID i1tm2fc with +3 score by [(onlythisfar, Reddit, 2022-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/tkuc24/what_is_a_good_strava_fitness_score_my_thoughts/i1tm2fc/) (in reply to ID i1tfw1f):\nI agree that it works out when you first start training. But it's only cumulative over a certain rolling period (I seem to recall 40 days, weighted). So once you've done 40 days, if your individual score is less than the one that just rolled off, your total score goes down (or roughly. I don't entirely understand how the weighting works).\n\n#### Comment ID i1vc6ik with +1 score by [(bono_my_tires, Reddit, 2022-03-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/tkuc24/what_is_a_good_strava_fitness_score_my_thoughts/i1vc6ik/) (in reply to ID i1tfw1f):\nAre you saying that if I ride the same route twice even on zwift it takes the fact that it’s the same route into consideration?

As a stats nerd I want to drive the number up, but that is unrealistic term as my body still requires some rest (which brings the score down). For measuring fitness alone the stat seems misnamed. Still, comparing the score to my past self is a pretty good measure for how dedicated I have been to training. Interested to hear if others have found the rating useful, even if you disagree with how it is named.\n\n### Comment ID i1sphob with +10 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/tkuc24/what_is_a_good_strava_fitness_score_my_thoughts/i1sphob/) (in reply to ID i1smarb):\nHey, thanks for posting this as a fellow data-nerd. I used to think the fitness score was more realistic than I do now. Now, after several years of strava use, the fitness score for me just roughly tells me if I'm increasing my load in a safe manner, if I am generally at a plateau in my fitness, or if I have been resting too much. \n\nIt seems to over value the \"historically hard\" workouts while under valuing functional strength training, and hard-sprint swims. Specifically, I think it places too much emphasis on workout length. I've done a very hard mile swim with a good heart rate and gotten a pathetic fitness score from it, +/-0, +10 effort. So, in those cases where it's massively undervaluing a workout, I'll switch from HR to \"perceived effort\" to get a more realistic feedback. \n\nThat said, I was working my ass off in the fall to improve run/swim times and got up to an 86 total fitness score. Life happened over the holidays and it settled back down to a 50-60. I broke my ankle and took several (8) weeks off and then hit the pool and gym again to build up. The fitness score has been a good way to follow a rough \"center mass\" of my fitness improvements. After 9 weeks I'm back up to a 45-52avg. And, honestly, I'd say I feel like I'm there and that's accurate.\n\nWhat the fitness score can't do is tell me that when my score was 80-85 that I wasn't cooling down, I wasn't stretching, my hamstrings sucked, and I was an injury waiting to happen. Since my injury I've been healing well, doing the knees over toes strength through flexibility approach, lifting weights and doing 20-40 mins of full body stretching each day. At a fitness score of 50 today I'd say I'm in a better place than that 80 last year. When I build back up to 80 by summer it will be through a more successful, full body approach to fitness.\n\n#### Comment ID i1sreny with +4 score by [(MillennialHOA, Reddit, 2022-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/tkuc24/what_is_a_good_strava_fitness_score_my_thoughts/i1sreny/) (in reply to ID i1sphob):\nI like your thought on a fitness center of gravity, that shouts summarizes how I view the score. Also, I hear you on over valuing historic efforts, very long running races impact the score the most for me but if I had to tell you what they did to my fitness it’s mostly flat or net negative as they require recovery and don’t actually leave me feeling as fit as a few milder training runs stacked for another week.\n\n### Comment ID i1sqd4n with +9 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/tkuc24/what_is_a_good_strava_fitness_score_my_thoughts/i1sqd4n/) (in reply to ID i1smarb):\nI also found it not really fair in general.

Skepticism is understood, that is my approach to most of these as well.

First, I use the Elevate extension in Chrome to get a better, more accurate score that let's you set different FTPs for different periods of the season. Strava itself only has one FTP entry that will retroactively change all your previous workouts that weren't at your brand new tested FTP.  Also it doesn't really make sense. I do Trainerroad low or medium volume and I'll barely gain 1 point a week. Rest weeks doing nothing or recovery only rides tanks the score every training block.

I did a 4 hour XC race and my fitness score went from 24 to 42. Intensity-wise, this was a relatively low intensity, basically a 50/50 split between Zone 3 and Zone 4 heart rate.\n\nThroughout 2021 I did some further racing and those events drastically bumped up my score. In between races I generally did much shorter rides to focus on intensity and sprinting. Between races, despite riding at least a few times a week, my fitness dropped over time.\n\nI'm not sure how they gauge the decrease i fitness but I think, for me, that makes the scoring less useful. A lot of other comments are similar to my feeling; I am no question more fit, I just may not be doing as many activities. Strava should really bench mark us against ourselves to work out our decline in fitness, if any, over time rather than the same assumption.\n\nMy personal opinion is that the relative effort isn't bad week-to-week, rather than this scoring system. For individual efforts, I prefer the Garmin training effect score. I'm not convinced there is a good way to measure long term fitness using the simple metrics Strava uses without way more analytics. For example, filtering out low efforts which are obviously not a test of fitness (i.e high itensity racing vs casual rides)\n\n### Comment ID i1xgy0n with +1 score by [(MillennialHOA, Reddit, 2022-03-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/tkuc24/what_is_a_good_strava_fitness_score_my_thoughts/i1xgy0n/) (in reply to ID i1wsmz5):\nWhoa, and +18 point jump is about the biggest I’ve heard of- though that is about linearly equal to what I’ve seen from a 2.5hr run, if you also consider that it’s a rolling average and assume your replacing a day that had no effort. I’ll have to check out Garmin’s score. \n\nI agree though that there is much more that does into this than just time and heart rate.

And there’s no “good” score.  And it isn’t useful to compare with other athletes.  In fact the Strava Fitness score is a representation of Chronic Training Load.  Ie how much you have stressed your body over a long (6?week) period.  If you aren’t actually very fit (in terms of aerobic base) and you run 5k in 30 mins you will earn a much larger contribution to your “Fitness” score than would a professional athlete (running the same course in the same time, as s/he would be not breaking a sweat), hence why comparisons are useless.  It’s only part of the picture, you could do a lot of training and get a high score but not be rested to race.  You need to consider your Acute (1 week) load too to determine how well you might actually perform in a race.  Search Training Peaks TSS, ATL, CTL and TSB for more info than I can be bothered to type.  Strava “Fitness” score is analogous with ChronicTraining Load (CTL)\n\n## Comment ID kaonmv4 with +1 score by [(Talby51, Reddit, 2023-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/tkuc24/what_is_a_good_strava_fitness_score_my_thoughts/kaonmv4/) (in reply to ID tkuc24):\nI remember keeping an eye on it during my last marathon training cycle a few years ago (last time I paid for a sub) and I found it pretty useless until factoring in the freshness scores along with the 'peak' overlay. Amazingly it all came together during my taper and I ran a much better time than I thought I could.\n\nIt was a mildly interesting thing to watch, but during the last 3 weeks I kept a close eye on how my freshness went up as I dropped off volume. Found it useful to have a metric other than \"how knackered do I feel\" to keep me focused on tapering in a way that worked for me and not everyone else I knew.\n\nAt the time the website version of it was much more informative than the app, not sure if that's changed recently but it's one of the reasons I cancelled my sub. Couldn't agree paying for a service where the app (which let's face it is much more accessible) has less functionality for viewing fairly simple metrics than the website.",

Why do you use Strava: for performance metrics? To create routes? Or just for the social aspect?\n\nIf you want all in one, there's no alternative. Strava is king.\n\nFor the social part, Strava is also the best one by far. Seeing your friends or local club workouts, giving kudos, segments and all that stuff. For everything else, you have free alternatives that are arguably better.\n\nFor performance and workout analysis: if you have a Garmin device, you can use Garmin Connect. All other major brands will have their own cloud platform as well, for free (Polar, Suunto etc). If you want to keep things local, there's [GoldenCheetah](https://www.goldencheetah.org/). If you use your phone for tracking, then there's a huge selection of good apps to track your workouts, but I can't comment as I haven't tried many (I'm stuck to Garmin).\n\nTo create routes, there's [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/) (free in your own region) and [Bikemap](https://www.bikemap.net/). Even Google Maps nowadays will do a more-or-less decent job in developed countries. UPDATE: also [Ride with GPS](https://ridewithgps.com/).\n\nFinal option is to keep using Strava and extend it with 3rd party services. For workout analysis, there's [https://intervals.icu](https://intervals.icu) (consider donating!). For automations, calendar export, weather and Spotify data, component tracking and some other extra bits, there's [https://strautomator.com](https://strautomator.com) (disclaimed: I'm the dev).

It incorporates standard fitness tracking features like distance, elevation, and time, but goes further by infusing a light role-playing gaming (RPG) theme, complete with unique character development and elements like points, rewards, and course challenges that motivate users to remain active and achieve their fitness goals.\r  \n\r  \nYou can craft a unique narrative that transforms your running or cycling route into an exciting adventure.\r  \n\r  \nIn addition to these features, our app encourages user participation by allowing them to share their course creations, compete, or support one another through various courses. This fosters a dynamic and interactive fitness community.\r  \n\r  \nBy lightly gamifying fitness, we create a sense of enjoyment and purpose, turning exercise into an activity to look forward to and explore.\r  \n\r  \nOur app is tailored to individuals who are fitness-focused (not gamers) and seeking a more engaging and enjoyable way to track their outdoor activities. By merging social fitness and gaming we hope to create a community of adventure seekers who use our mobile app to explore the great outdoors while reaching their fitness goals.\r  \n\r  \n*/end-of-pitch*\r  \n\r  \nI believe there is a cross-section of us athletes that would enjoy having a little more colour and imagination with our fitness tracking tools.

I’ve been running a lot in the past few years and I for my fourth marathon preparation I decided to finally buy a running watch. I selected two models: Forerunner 265 and Forerunner 965. I know the price is different so my hesitation doesn’t come from here. \n\nI’m used to run with my phone only and to receive a recap with a small map showing the places I’ve been to (see picture below). I know FR265 doesn’t have a live map option (= navigation?) like FR965 or my running phone apps.\n\nI use Strava to share my workouts and that’s really important to me. I know I can synchronise my workouts from any of the two watches to Strava through the Garmin app, but will the map appear on Strava or the Garmin app if I use a FR265 (even if I cannot see the map on my watch)? That’s my real concern. I think FR265 shows a small drawing of the route I ran on, but does it record the names of the streets and cities? Can I run with a FR265 and without my phone?\n\nI really don’t need the live map from \n\nThank you very much, for your replies. I’m really new to smart watches (I’m 28yo, using an iPhone 13, if that helps).\n\n## Comment ID jx6detv with +3 score by [(Liveforreds, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/15xgg92/maps_recap_fr265_on_strava_or_garmin_app/jx6detv/) (in reply to ID 15xgg92):\nBoth the FR 265 and 965 have the ability to track your runs with GPS and, after syncing either watch with the Garmin app, you can view the running route on the map directly in the phone app. If you have your Strava account linked to your Garmin account, then your runs will sync to Strava as well. \n\nIn both Garmin and Strava, you can view the GPS route, including street names, cities, etc. Both maps also allow you to change to satellite view. However, as far as I’m aware, only Garmin will allow you to also include a “data overlay” on the running route where the running route becomes color graded to express faster/slower pacing, heart rate, and elevation.\n\nAs for mapping directly on the watch, the FR 265 does not have this feature so you will not be able to see a live map while running. When you finish a run, it shows the “shape” of your route on the watch and once the watch syncs with the phone, you’ll see the route on a map. With the FR 965, you can view the map while running and have directions if you’re running a course.\n\nYou can run without your phone using either watch, you just won’t have any cell service to text or make calls.\n\n### Comment ID jx73r2o with +1 score by [(wingoerts, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/15xgg92/maps_recap_fr265_on_strava_or_garmin_app/jx73r2o/) (in reply to ID jx6detv):\nThank you very much for your complete reply, it helped me a lot and I think I’ll go for the FR265 ! ⌚️\n\n## Comment ID jx6fo7f with +2 score by [(ChrisTexan1, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/15xgg92/maps_recap_fr265_on_strava_or_garmin_app/jx6fo7f/) (in reply to ID 15xgg92):\nYou are mixing watch \"map displays\" versus \"route recording\".  For workouts when completed, any/all dedicated sports ecosystems (Polar, Suunto, Coros, Garmin, Apple)currently out there, show what you did on a map/overlay.  And all are exportable or linkable to other platforms.  \n\nSo simple answer, any GPS recording you take on your watch, can auto-sync to Strava, which will overlay it with their maps.  And if you look at it in the device's portal/app, you can display it on a map (most default to that), and you can change from topo, to satellite, to road map, etc on most if not all.  \n\nAnd you can link to other services, like [Relive.CC](https://Relive.CC) for example, that can then do dynamic overlays with pictures, video, statistics along a fly-by route of what you did.  \n\nEven GPS watches that have NO \"preloaded routes/mapping/navigation\" features, still record the GPS in the file, and once it's sync'd to it's app/web, it's displayed/displayable on maps, it's just that the watch itself can't show it.\n\n### Comment ID jx73vl3 with +1 score by [(wingoerts, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/15xgg92/maps_recap_fr265_on_strava_or_garmin_app/jx73vl3/) (in reply to ID jx6fo7f):\nThank you very much !\n\n## Comment ID jx6pvsq with +1 score by [(Walksuphills, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/15xgg92/maps_recap_fr265_on_strava_or_garmin_app/jx6pvsq/) (in reply to ID 15xgg92):\nIf I understand correctly, yes.

To correct this you'll need to disconnect and reconnect your accounts. \n\nHere is how: \n\n* On [Strava.com](https://www.strava.com/dashboard)\n * Navigate to your [settings page](https://www.strava.com/settings/profile) and locate your 'Social Connections'\n * Under 'Social Connections,' locate the Garmin connection and click 'Disconnect'\n\n* On the 'Modern' version of [Garmin Connect](http://connect.garmin.com/modern/)\n * Navigate to the head icon(left-hand side) \n * Select 'Settings'\n * Select [Account Information](http://connect.garmin.com/modern/account)\n * Scroll to bottom.\n\nAfter you disconnect the accounts, go ahead and reconnect by following **[these instruction](https://strava.zendesk.com/entries/48729094-Uploading-to-Strava-from-a-Garmin-device#GE)**\n\n---\n\nThe second possibility is that the wrong Garmin Connect account may have gotten linked to that device when it was first connected with Garmin Express. To check which Garmin Connect account is associated with that device, please follow **[these instructions:](https://strava.zendesk.com/entries/62952890-Garmin-data-is-uploading-to-someone-else-s-account-Garmin-Express-)**\n\n1. Open Garmin Express.\n2. Select a device from the drop-down on the upper left.\n3. Click \"Device\" on the upper right.\n4. Scroll to the bottom of the page and look for \"Garmin Connect Account\".\n5. Change account, if necessary\n\n---\n\nGive that a try and let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n## Comment ID czec2br with +2 score by [(Fragglekfc, Reddit, 2016-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/42mzew/strava_uploads_garmin_to_two_profiles/czec2br/) (in reply to ID 42mzew):\nAll sorted, thanks for information, big help!\n\n### Comment ID czi4dez with +1 score by [(stravasean, Reddit, 2016-01-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/42mzew/strava_uploads_garmin_to_two_profiles/czi4dez/) (in reply to ID czec2br):\nYou're welcome Fragglekfc!

Peloton told me it was a Strava issue. I can't seem to get any clarity on where the problem is. I've revoked access to Peloton in my Strava profile, cleared the cache on the Peloton and rebooted.

I had revoked the access on my Strava account and turned off the partnership option, too. As you say in  your second point there is probably some token saved on Peloton's end. I have a support ticket opened with Peloton from last week, that I opened back up yesterday. I attached screenshots of the error to my ticket in their support portal, along with the email of Strava saying it's a Peloton issue.

Basically, I had to uninstall and reinstall the Peloton app. Here's the flow from their support team:\n\nPlease follow the steps below to uninstall and reinstall the Peloton app:\n\n\\-> Click on the time in the top right corner -> Go to Device Settings -> Apps -> Peloton -> Click on Force Stop -> Click on the 3 vertical dots in the upper right-hand corner of the screen -> Select Uninstall Updates -> Click on OK -> Click the Peloton Logo/Home \n\nA download should then happen and will ask you to log in to your Wifi network and account.\n\nOnce I did that, I was able to log back into my Strava account through Peloton and sync my data. Error was gone.\n\nThanks again u/ClipIn for steering me in the right direction.

THANK YOU!!! From what I've read elsewhere you saved me hours of aggravation on the phone with support.\n\nIt appears that even though we each have a separate Peloton account on the bike, only one Peloton account per bike can be attached to a Strava account, which is a bummer and something I wish Peloton would fix.\n\n## Comment ID itqekw6 with +1 score by [(Ok_Professional914, Reddit, 2022-10-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pelotoncycle/comments/en2ddk/strava_issue_this_account_is_already_associated/itqekw6/) (in reply to ID en2ddk):\nI know this is an old thread - but I'm having this same exact issue and wanted to see if anyone has a new  suggestion (I just bought a barely used peloton bike off a friend last week, so I'm going to be a steady peloton user going forward).  I tried a hard reset, cleared the cache, revoked and disabled access on Strava, and even tried changing my strava e-mail - still getting the same \"This account is already associated with a Peloton user\" error.  Also tried the \"Force Stop\" solution below from whoiscarmine - still didn't work.\n\nI reached out to Peloton support and I gave them all the pertinent information and this was their response - \"My engineer has responded to me on your issue.  It appears that you will need to contact Strava as they are the ones blocking this.\"  I reached out to Strava support last night, but I really don't think the issue is on their end.  I previously tried using peloton digital a few years ago, but otherwise, I've never had a peloton account and never logged into a bike / tread.\n\nAnybody have any other suggestions?  I found an interim work around using the Healthfit App (which sends Peloton data to Strava), but would be nice if I could get it to function properly.\n\nThanks!\n\n### Comment ID its89pi with +1 score by [(Ok_Professional914, Reddit, 2022-10-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pelotoncycle/comments/en2ddk/strava_issue_this_account_is_already_associated/its89pi/) (in reply to ID itqekw6):\nFigured it out...  Apparently I logged into another bike (Probably at a hotel) and used my gmail address rather than my regular email.  I had to log in using that e-mail address on the bike, uncheck the box, and log out.  Then when I logged in on the bike with my regular e-mail address that has the Peloton subscription, I was able to connect Strava.",

I can’t reach out to Strava because they don’t have customer service for billing. Moral of the story is to avoid Strava subscription at all costs. Not worth it and you risk being double charged with no chance of refund. Also can’t be charged back with the bank without compromising your Apple ID.

          "content": "i’ve been using this app for sometime now. In general, I really really like the app. It’s relatively easy to use and I’m happy that it’s able to get your heart rate from the Apple Watch.\n\nThat said it’s missing two key features. The first feature is the fact that you cannot, use the Apple Watch and the iPhone together at the same time. The reason I find this important is even though I may look on my Apple Watch most of the time while I’m hiking or any other activity and my phone is away, there are times when I’m hiking that I would like to see the map with the track I’m following and progress on the map itself. The only way to make this possible if you only use your phone without the watch at all. Even if you start your track on your phone, you cannot view the current status on the watch. i’m not saying to put the map on the Apple Watch as that would be quite difficult to navigate but in times you get lost and you want to see where you are on the map that’s impossible if you start it from the Apple Watch. Note, This is much different than syncing the Apple Watch and the iphone app. That sync has been seamless, but that sync can only occur after the fact which doesn’t help if your off the track and want to get back on the track. \n\nThe other aspect of the Apple Watch that is missing is the fact that you cannot rearrange the stats as you viewing them. I like seeing my mileage and it seems to be the smallest thing on the screen, and you have no way to edit the data view screen on the  watch. Slight inconvenience but if you need glasses to read, I would want to put the things that are important in larger text and up toward top. \n\nNote all that said the app is excellent and works as designed. If it had the features above, it would be a clear five star app for me",

We miss the mark here and there but we always make sure to make up for it and then some. I feel seen, heard, and valued overall. Could they do more to employ more diverse employees? Absolutely!

I think this is the largest pain point for the company, along with needs for leadership refinement/development. While leadership is made up of nice people, they don't have the skills necessary to effectively lead the organization and get it out of this rut it's been in. There is a strong community of individuals with similar interests in fitness/sports at the company, but I feel like this can lead to an echo chamber effect sometimes. Over the course of my time there, it was disappointing to see several features fail to take off, and I believe the company would benefit from more reflection and analysis on what went wrong and how to improve moving forward. The multiple reorgs last year has led to a great deal of confusion among the employees - ways of working and processes are always changing. It also appears the company relies on verbal recognition as the primary form of award and not additional comp/bonuses when it comes to recognizing employees who go above and beyond.",

The big accomplishments from the last couple years were mostly overdue tech upgrades, facelifts for a few existing pages, Suffer Score became Relative Effort and subscriptions were broken into packs. Oh, and marketing made ads that featured more casual athletes instead of making another video of an intense runner sprinting through a forest or a cyclist powering up a mountain road.\r\n- Every product team has a couple designers but the design team as a whole seems to operate independently. Designers spends a surprising amount of time in design reviews and meeting about things like design language and color choice. It's nice that every designer gets a voice in those exercises but actual results feels like an afterthought, which is okay because there doesn't seem to be any accountability.\r\n- The new San Francisco office is nice but the location is sketchy. Lunch options are limited. The soup kitchen next door means that there are a lot of homeless people around. There is always human waste and used needles on the sidewalks and commotions are common right outside the front door.\r\n- Benefits beyond base salary are weak. Things like paid insurance premiums and the equipment stipend are nice but insignificant in the scheme of things.\r\n- The culture is very focused on running and cycling but maybe to a fault if you like working with well-rounded people with diverse interests.",

The company hasn't been perfect in this regard historically, but they are making this a top priority now and going forward. \r\n- Accessible leaders. Slack/Zoom/phone/meetups with everyone all the way up to the CEO are not off the table. The company's executives do not sit in their ivory towers and look down on everyone, they are a part of Team Strava along with the rest of the employees\r\n- Open to change and innovation. While we can't do everything we want all the time, I think people's voices are heard and business/technical discussions are given the air time they need and when change makes sense, the company leans into it.\r\n- Too much more to write here and my manager would be disappointed if I spent my ENTIRE Friday sitting in front of my computer ;)",

This is truly an organization that practices what it preaches in terms of diversity, work-life balance, and pay equality. I remember being so impressed in a company all-hands one day when the HR team announced a new initiative to examine gender pay equality within the company. This speaks volumes about the company, management, and the board to be dedicating resources to such a worthy issue. And this is just one of countless examples of Strava working to do the right thing. For me at a personal level, I always felt that my managers and colleagues were invested in my growth and development. While I did end up leaving Strava to pursue an education, there was always an open dialogue about where I wanted to go career-wise and folks did all they could to support that while I was there. We even had (free!) access to a full time career coach who was very influential in my choosing to move into development.",

We acknowledge how difficult it can be to feel like you are gaining traction in your career and that we are being as efficient as we can be as a company when there are continual changes in managers and leaders. \n\nThe good news is that following Michael Horvath's return as CEO in late 2019 things have very much stabilized. We were most recently thrilled to add a new Chief Product and Experience Officer to the team, Meghan Laffey. We feel our leadership team is more solid than ever, and the company culture has never been stronger. \n\nWe wish you all the best in your next career move, and if you ever want to share more about your experience at Strava please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly at michele@strava.com.",

We also have a great track record of promoting people from within. I'm sorry that wasn't your impression, and I'd welcome the chance to hear about your specific experience if you'd like to reach out.

The engineering team has been investing a lot of effort over the last year to become more nimble and is moving to much faster releases, which makes us more nimble.\r\n\r\nPerks wise, it's tough to beat. Many of them are oriented around an athletic life style. On site yoga, pro deals with most gear manufacturers, stipends for new equipment and races, and fantastic health insurance, to name a few. Plenty of time off to make sure you can decompress or train. A few provided meals a week and otherwise plenty of snacks. We don't have three meals a day like many tech companies, but it's not a major downer, the local food is good and we all still eat lunch together away from our desks.",

I left about a year ago to pursue a career in software development and now having an outsider's perspective wanted to share this positive review to do my small part in helping Strava continue to grow and find the best people. This is truly an organization that practices what it preaches in terms of diversity, work-life balance, and pay equality. I remember being so impressed in a company all-hands one day when the HR team announced a new initiative to examine gender pay equality within the company. This speaks volumes about the company, management, and the board to be dedicating resources to such a worthy issue. And this is just one of countless examples of Strava working to do the right thing. For me at a personal level, I always felt that my managers and colleagues were invested in my growth and development. While I did end up leaving Strava to pursue an education, there was always an open dialogue about where I wanted to go career-wise and folks did all they could to support that while I was there. We even had (free!) access to a full time career coach who was very influential in my choosing to move into development.",

It's so refreshing to work at a recognized brand making a fun product that brings joy to people and doesn't carry with it any ethical ambiguity or toxicity. \r\n- Life:Work balance. Life comes first. Strava leadership and all employees walk the walk when it comes to promoting healthy, sustainable living... whether you're a walker, yogi, beach cruiser, or serious competitive athlete, everyone around you will encourage you to be active and focus on your personal life, including family and friends time\r\n- Diversity and Inclusion is being heavily invested in. The company hasn't been perfect in this regard historically, but they are making this a top priority now and going forward. \r\n- Accessible leaders. Slack/Zoom/phone/meetups with everyone all the way up to the CEO are not off the table. The company's executives do not sit in their ivory towers and look down on everyone, they are a part of Team Strava along with the rest of the employees\r\n- Open to change and innovation. While we can't do everything we want all the time, I think people's voices are heard and business/technical discussions are given the air time they need and when change makes sense, the company leans into it.\r\n- Too much more to write here and my manager would be disappointed if I spent my ENTIRE Friday sitting in front of my computer ;)",

      "# [How Hard Is It To Make Strava Art? on 2024-10-04](https://stories.strava.com/nl/articles/how-hard-is-it-to-make-strava-art)\nYou may have seen Strava Art in your feed, on Strava Stories, or even in the news, but have you ever wondered how hard it is to create a Strava masterpiece? Howard Calvert decided to find out...\n\nYou’ve no doubt seen some Strava art, if not on your own Strava feed, in our Strava Stories section, or even in the news.\n\nIf you haven’t, Strava art is the term given to an activity on Strava that creates a piece of art using the GPS map of the activity.\n\nSometimes it may happen inadvertently, for example when someone comments that your 10K run route looks “a bit like an arrow”, but usually it’s a finely tuned and intricately planned masterpiece, sometimes months in the making.\n\nRELATED: 13 Pieces of Strava Art That Made Us... Wow\n\nOver the past few years, these Strava art designs have become so impressive they deserve to be framed and displayed in a gallery. Recent jaw-dropping examples include Nicolas Georgiou’s koi carp in London, Lenny Maughan's Road Runner and BigBird DPS Art’s mind-bending Impossible (Penrose) Triangle.\n\nSo I decided to take up the challenge of creating my own Strava art. How hard could it be?\n\nStrava Art: The Hard Miles\n\nAs it turns out, it’s exceedingly difficult and I tip my cap to the athletes out there creating artwork that simply astounds in its design. How do they do it?\n\nI asked Nico Georgiou for his advice on how he creates work like his koi carp, Mark Cavendish for the TdF, and his seriously impressive, 237 mile / 383km-long ‘Something for the Olympics’. Based in London, his day job is as a designer, something he says helps inform his Strava artwork.\n\n“With any Strava art design, I start by looking at a map,” he says. “Then I just go for it. I throw my first navigation point down, second point, third point, and then I expand lines and move them around on the map.\n\nRELATED: Love Strava Art? How to Create Your Own Masterpiece\n\n“For me, the drawing itself isn’t the problem — it’s trying to find the infrastructure in the roads and how to navigate things like rivers and train tracks.”\n\nIf Nico’s design needs to cross a river — and he regularly crosses the Thames in his art — he pauses the recording, rides to the nearest bridge, crosses, and then rides to where the drawing will continue before unpausing, meaning Strava’s GPS will draw a straight line across the river to that point. This results in him cycling farther than the distance shown on the final artwork — sometimes up to 70km more.\n\nOther big challenges are one-way systems, getting over footbridges, London parks closing at night, even unexpected police cordons or roads closed due to roadworks.\n\n“There’s a lot of problem-solving,” he says. “The first problem is the planning and drawing stage.” This usually takes him five or six hours of initial drawing which are then intricately refined over the course of a month. “I start with a point A and point B, and fill in the space between. For the koi carp, there were 666 navigation points.”\n\nThe next problem is the actual drawing of it on his bike. “Study the map and work out exactly what you need to make it work when riding it,” he advises. “If there’s a one-way street, for example, I know I’ll have to hop off my bike and walk along the sidewalk, or put my bike over my shoulder and cross a footbridge.”\n\nRELATED: Around the World in Strava Art\n\nHe also warns that having fully-charged batteries is of paramount importance, for both your GPS systems and your bike lights. The koi carp took him around 20 hours in total, starting at 3.30 am. “I navigate via my phone, and record the ride on my Garmin.”\n\nBut, for Nico, it’s this combined challenge of designing the artwork and then completing it, that draws him back in time and time again. “That and the headspace it provides,” he says, “even though my wife thinks I’m mad!”\n\nFor me, the drawing itself isn’t the problem — it’s trying to find the infrastructure in the roads and how to navigate things like rivers and train tracks.\n\nStrava Art: Expert Advice\n\nNico’s tips for beginners wanting to have a go at their own Strava art include:\n\nStick to freeform ideas. Try not to do anything too regimented.\n\nAvoid circles. You need to go a huge distance to create a decent circle.\n\n“Planning is an important part of creating a successful piece of art,” says Nico. “If you’re on a bike, do it in a town with plenty of roads to make it work. If you’re running, my suggestion is to use a large empty field and prep the route with markers as reference points.”\n\nUse a route-building website, such as Strava’s route planner.\n\nStart drawing! As Nico says, begin with two navigation points and take it from there. Be as creative as you like, or keep it simple, with something like a heart or a star if you want to build confidence.\n\nSave and export your ride to your device, whether it’s a watch or bike computer.\n\nStart riding or running, following the route you designed.\n\nTry not to take any wrong turns, as that could ruin the end product.\n\nEnjoy your activity, soak up the new sights. At the end, it’s the moment of truth — view the final art in Strava, and publish it on your feed.\n\nArt Attack\n\nWith that advice in mind, I head out on my own art-based expedition. I know I want to keep it local, and to start with run rather than cycle. But what to design? I experiment with something basic — a heart on a large, open field — but quickly give up when I figure it will inevitably end up resembling a large blob.\n\nThen, it hits me: what would be more appropriate than the kudos sign? A thumbs up for all Strava users. I scan my local area for anything that might string together to form the symbol… eventually, I draw what I think is a good enough thumbs up using the Strava route planner.\n\nGET PLANNING: Strava Routes and Heatmap: Find New Places to Go\n\nBut while I’m there I get a little more ambitious. These grids of new housing could easily form eyes… with a nose, mouth, whiskers… it’s a cat! But I can’t get the ears to work due to a canal and roads inaccessible due to military use. Maybe it looks more like the Grinch? When I attempt to run it, I suddenly change my mind and realize it could be Mario, so I have to adjust parts of it on the fly, keeping Nico’s advice to “not do anything too regimented” at the forefront of my mind.",
      "# [Updates to Strava’s API Agreement on 2024-11-19](https://press.strava.com/articles/updates-to-stravas-api-agreement)\nUpdated on Nov. 19\n\nWe wanted to provide some additional context around the changes to our API Agreement and the impact for our users and developers. We currently anticipate these changes will impact less than .1% of applications and proactively notified the majority of those affected last week.\n\nEnhanced Privacy and User Control\n\nPrivacy and user control are at the forefront of our platform. As a result, we are committed to evolving our API practices as regulatory requirements and user expectations shift. This includes the decision to limit the ability of a user’s data to be displayed by third-party apps in ways the user may not expect. Specifically, we want to thoughtfully address situations where users connect to a third-party app and are unaware that their data is being surfaced not just for their own use and visibility, but also to other users (for example, in a public feed or heatmap). The latest API changes address this scenario and provide a more consistent framework for Strava user data.\n\nTraining AI Models\n\nWe believe in the potential of AI to transform the athlete experience–whether it’s delivering more personalized insights to help you reach your goals, generating route or training recommendations, or countless other possibilities. But innovation in this space must be handled responsibly and with a firm focus on user control. As part of our generative AI features, we are committed to implementing thoughtful solutions that prioritize user control and the ability to opt out.\n\nThird-party developers may not take such a deliberate approach to training AI models and as a result, we believe the best decision for the platform and for users is to prohibit the use of data extracted from Strava users in this manner. Our previous terms already disallowed the use of Strava user data in model training and development but we’ve made this more explicit in light of the increasing activity in this space.\n\nNo Impact to Most Developers\n\nWe recognize that our platform thrives because of the creativity and dedication of third-party developers who build tools to complement and extend Strava’s capabilities. We are steadfast in our commitment to fostering this ecosystem. We anticipate that these changes will affect only a small fraction (less than .1%) of the applications on the Strava platform–the overwhelming majority of existing use cases are still allowed, including coaching platforms focused on providing feedback to users and tools that help users understand their data and performance.\n\nCollectively, these changes reflect our commitment to ensuring that Strava remains a trusted platform for athletes and developers alike. That means holding ourselves—and anyone building on our platform—to high standards.\n\n###",
      "# [Activities missing in feed](https://communityhub.strava.com/general-chat-2/activities-missing-in-feed-3859)\nPage 1 / 1\n\nYesterday me feed order (which is set at chronological) suddenly changed putting activities (that I had already seen and given kudos) from the beginning of this month at the top and hiding most recent activities in the middle of the month. This has also happened to a friends. No amount of changing the feed order does anything to rectify this. Why has it happened?\n\nSame, on app and website, feed is just random... it's showing runs I did last month and nothing recent except latest\n\nIt looks like Strava made a change which switched the default ordering from latest activities to personalized, I've seen this reported in a few other places. You can change the preference from https://www.strava.com/settings/display under \"Feed Ordering\" or in the app under You > Gear Icon (top right) > Feed Ordering. See https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001183630-Feed-Ordering\n\nUnfortunately per Strava, the change will only impact new activities so it won't fix the issue right away.\n\nAny changes will apply only to new activities in your feed, so you may not notice a difference at first\n\nI might be an outlier, but I use Strava primarily to view my own activities. It seems that recently the activity feed filter on the website has changed, and it now only shows athletes I'm following by default. I have to select \"My Activities\" to see my own activities and, whenever I return to the activity feed page, it shows the athletes I'm following again.\n\nIn the past I could simply see ALL activities, mine and those I follow. Why has this option been deleted? I liked that.\n\nIt seems Strava is really emphasizing activities of other athletes over my own. I found the same to be true in the Android App. After I open it I have to press two buttons to view my own activities and none to view those of others. I only use the app for it's beacon feature, so I don't know if this was different in the past, nor do I really care. It is strange though.\n\nYes, Strava thinks of itself as a social platform, and I don't mind that, but having to dig around for the thing I'm really interested in seems strange. What's up with that?\n\nIf you scroll down a long way, do your own activities appear somewhen in the \"I'm following\" sections? Strava made some buggy changes to the activity sortings for users which used the chronological sorting of the feed. There is another thread with a similar problem: https://communityhub.strava.com/t5/campfire-chat/activities-missing-in-feed/td-p/41907\n\n@Jan_MantauYes, even though the feed is set to \"Following\", when I scroll back to before 1st of September I do see my own activities in the feed. I guess I'm not following myself anymore since the beginning of the month. 🙄\n\nExtra info: My \"Display Preferences\" > \"Feed Ordering\" is set as \"Latest Activities\", since the description of \"Personalized\" sounds awful.\n\nDid you need to change it to personalized or has it always been set to chronological?\n\nI'm asking because if you changed it, it only affects new activities so you won't see the change right away. It will display correctly from now on though.\n\nI did try several things so, yes, I might have changed it.\n\nI just did a very strenuous desk exercise of 11 seconds, uploaded it, and indeed it does now appear again in the \"Following\" feed.\n\nThis seems to solve the issue. I guess the \"Personalized\" feed is new and Strava pushes people to it? I now see that more people aren't happy with that.\n\nHi @Ajwaller,\n\nTo add some additional context to what @ActivityFix noted; we recently made a change in our model that surfaces older activities a user may have missed amongst newer activities. If you'd like to view your feed in chronological order please ensure your Feed Ordering setting is set to \"Latest Activities.\" If it's already set to \"Latest Activities,\" you can perform a reset by selecting \"Personalized\" and then switching back to \"Latest Activities.\"\n\nAfter changing the setting, the feed will not update immediately. Only activities uploaded after the setting change will follow the rules of the new setting.\n\nAdditionally, there may be some cases where an older activity appears at the top of the feed when an athlete you’re following makes an older activity publicly visible. We do this to make sure you see every activity from athletes you follow as soon as possible.\n\nFor additional information, see our help center article here: How the Strava feed works\n\nThis is a lesson to devs. Don’t fix what is not broken. Suddenly all my recent runs from my own feed disappeared as did all the people I follow. Changing settings did not fix….maybe moving forward but why mess with what works and what people use the platform for. If there is no reliable feed there is no Strava\n\nthere must be some issue with your model. i see completely different activities after every reload\n\nSo I did a ride two days ago and it uploaded automatically on completion through my phone. When I opened Strava (web) to admire my achievement it was nowhere to be seen. Eventually found it at about 200th in the feed, buried under entries from October and November in apparently random date order. I had never changed the ordering setting.\n\nI have tried changing the ordering setting backwards and forward several times, but it refuses to put my ride in the correct sequence - if anything it seems to make it worse.\n\nit drives me nuts when something that worked perfectly for years suddenly gets broken by an upgrade.\n\nStrava gods please fix it, even if it needs a one time button to set my entire history to chronological order! Randomization shouldn’t be an option, but now it seems to be the default.",
      "# [Strava API Agreement Update by mcneese.chad on 2024-11-18](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/strava-api-agreement-update/98191)\nYou might’ve seen this from Strava in your email just now:\n\nㅤ\n\nWe’re reaching out to inform you of a change that affects how third-party apps connected to Strava may display certain information. This update, effective on November 11th, is part of our commitment to privacy and transparency across all connected apps and devices.\n\nㅤ\n\n…which includes this condition:\n\nData Use Limitations:\n\nWe’re updating our terms to explicitly prohibit third parties from using any data obtained via Strava’s API in artificial intelligence models or other similar applications.\n\nㅤ\n\nWhich platforms is that going to effect?\n\nReading between the lines … strava saying “it’s OUR data and we need to protect our most valuable asset”.\n\nThe only third party I share strava with is intervals.icu. But IMO would make sense to start sharing the primary source of data (garmin, wahoo, etc) with third parties rather than strava, even though strava is usually the easiest.\n\nI do this stuff for a living and hope this isn’t the start of a larger trend. Like I’m not going to be happy if Garmin pulls something like this. Unfortunately pervasive in my industry though (healthcare).\n\nIf that is indeed true I suppose I can always do:\n\nWahoo → TR and Zwift → TR (if that is indeed coming soon) for my indoor, unstructured rides.\n\nI understand why Strava is doing this but I feel like this could be the user’s choice on a third party integration basis.\n\nIt sure sounds like it, so I guess the best thing to do in this case is cut out the middleman and sync directly from Wahoo/Garmin to TrainerRoad (and intervals.icu) and… that pretty much kills my primary use case for Strava\n\nAlso, lol:\n\nNote: Per our Community Guidelines and Guidelines to Ideas, posts requesting or attempting to have Strava revert business decisions will not be permitted.\n\nOkay, then. I’ll vote with my wallet instead.\n\nIt is definitely rich that Strava has implemented AI itself using data ** checks notes ** obtained via third party APIs but is apparently forbidding the reciprocation.\n\nI am still in “benefit of the doubt” mode as I haven’t read the full legalese but lol.\n\nI do wonder if they are aware of this they will rightfully stay quiet for the time being. If they unsure what this means for their integration with Strava it is usually best in the company’s interest to stay quiet until they get full clarify on the legal implications, if any.\n\nThat is part of the reason I skipped a tag for now.\n\nBut if this is so far reaching, I would have hoped that Strava might give a heads up to those potentially affected 3rd parties. Or not… and they are blindsiding them the same us average people?\n\nIt sounds like a very strong move.\n\nThe sort of thing that only a company that is exceptionally confident of its position in the market would do.\n\nI wonder if Strava would be classed as a monopolist and, if so, if this would be an abuse of its market power?\n\nWe have the post above from David (Intervals.icu) and I saw another on Reddit where developers shared that they were notified by Strava earlier than we (the users) were.\n\nThanks for sharing the Intervals.icu update, as I had asked this exact question. I believe this change means coaches will no longer be able to view our activities on Intervals/TrainingPeaks. If that’s the case, the only use I have for Strava is the heat maps, and I’m sure not paying their annual rate for that.\n\nFor what it’s worth, I have an API application and only got the notice about the changes two hours ago. Granted, it’s a very small application so maybe I didn’t merit any more advance warning (the only user is me, I’m using the API to show my own data on my own website, which it seems I’m not allowed to do anymore )",

Mine shows as connected not doesn't send the data or show up in Strava...\n\nThat is a very good question. I have not yet recorded an activity but will let you know if it works or not\n\nThis is indeed not working. I took a walk to the pub to test it and at least backward sync to Jefit is not happening.\n\nCorrection, it is working. I can see the logs from Strava in Jefit.

I also sync to Google Fit and Garmin Connect so not sure if this might be causing issues... I created a manual activity in Garmin Connect and it synced into Strava no problem.

I did a workout two hours ago and it still is not showing in Strava.\n\nOK, so it seems that anything recorded in Strava is now flowing through into JEFit but it looks as if it is only one way integration. Bit bummed about that but thinking further I'm not sure what sort of information about Strength Training (or Weight Training in Strava-speak) can be transferred across. I don't think exercises, sets and reps information can be captured in Strava. I could be wrong...\n\nMine's working the other way around after not working from jefit to Strava initially.

      "# [Get to Know a Skier’s Strava: John Steel Hagenbuch Goes Long. Very Long. on 2024-09-27](https://nordicinsights.news/2024/09/27/get-to-know-a-skiers-strava-john-steel-hagenbuch-goes-long-very-long/)\nBy Gavin Kentch\n\nWelcome back to “Get to know a skier’s Strava,” an occasional feature showcasing an athlete’s Strava account. Previously in this series: Federico Pellegrino, Michaela Keller-Miller, and Pål Golberg Eats Breakfast.\n\nThe mass of athletic men lead lives of quiet consistency, as I’m pretty sure Thoreau once said. There is no way to develop the aerobic capacity to succeed in this deeply demanding sport without a cumulative thousands of hours’ worth of easy distance under your belt; there is no way to reliably log, say, 800 hours of easy distance a year without being consistently conservative in your approach. Twenty weeks @ 40 hours apiece and forty weeks @ 20 hours both work out to the same total number of hours, but one of them is a great deal more likely to be sustainable in the long run.\n\nJohn Steel Hagenbuch is not most men, and he cares little for your physiological conservatism. Let’s take a look at his training for the week of September 2–8, 2024, humorously denominated on Strava as “Shrimp Week” for reasons that I am neither young nor hip enough to understand (yes I get that the leitmotif here is a movie that came out in 1994). Buckle up; what you are about to read may shock you.\n\nMonday morning: 50km rollerski\n\nAt 9:21 a.m. on Monday morning, Shrimp Week USA 🦐 2024 officially gets underway. John Steel Hagenbuch does a 50km rollerski, in 2:25. Impressive for many mortals, but likely not a huge physiological undertaking for Steel Hagenbuch, who V2s with a fluidity belying its grace and strength, and who logs 50km rollerskis far more frequently than your typical athlete.\n\nAverage HR here is 144, so overall this may be a moderate effort for someone with a MHR well over 190, though that figure hides some consistent periods of elevated HR over several climbs. The back roads of New Hampshire look somewhere between perfect and idyllic here; I am jealous.\n\nMonday afternoon: 49km rollerski\n\nWe’re already at 4:20 (lol) on Monday afternoon, and this is our first sign that this is not going to be a normal week. Steel Hagenbuch heads north this time, on a tridentine route into eastern Vermont, knocking out another 49 kilometers in just over three hours on his feet.\n\nOne of his videos embedded in this post captures a peaceful moment on an empty road. Dusk approaches. The world quiets; crickets are chirping. And still Steel Hagenbuch rolls on.\n\nIt is now Monday evening. The man has already logged a cool 99km, and 5:15 moving time, for the day. This is roughly equivalent to my highest *weekly* rollerski total from the past summer (I run a lot, okay).\n\nTuesday morning: 65km rollerski\n\nMonday evening’s workout concluded after 7 p.m., if you read elapsed time against starting time and do the math. Less than 14 hours later, Steel Hagenbuch is at it again. He goes north and east this time, out to Lyme, New Hampshire, and back. Detours slightly mid-roll to log a dozen repeats up a short climb. Picks up a KOM on a 118-meter hors catégorie climb earlier in the ski, ascending an eight-percent grade with his HR at a chill 153.\n\nAverage HR for this morning’s workout, in toto, is 123. Speaking of chill.\n\nTuesday afternoon: 45km rollerski\n\nTuesday afternoon, Steel Hagenbuch is back onto the rollerskis once more. Into Vermont this time, and “just” 45km this time, but also that’s still well over 100 kilometers of cumulative rollerskiing for the day.\n\nThe average HR for this session is 117, MHR a sedate 134. I’m going to have some pronounced “don’t try this at home, kids” cautions at the end of this article, but in all seriousness, if there is a broader takeaway from this profile that anyone can use, it’s that you really do have to ramp down the effort when you increase the volume. This week is just a memorably extreme exemplar of that moral.\n\nWednesday morning: 107km rollerski\n\nWednesday morning: for a change of pace, some rollerskiing.\n\nSteel Hagenbuch knocks out the century mark in one fell swoop this time, leaving the Dartmouth campus at 9:27 a.m., swinging by in the early afternoon for, I would hope, a whole lot of food, then heading out again for another 40+ kilometers after lunch.\n\nThe entire rollerski — 107 kilometers, 6+ hours — takes place over two large loops, with basically no overlap. I’m not sure there are 107 kilometers in the entire state of Alaska combined where I would feel comfortable rollerskiing on the roads like this… we do “rural” here, sure, but not so much “chill rural farm roads.” Or farms, for that matter. New England, man.\n\nIt is now Wednesday afternoon, less than halfway through the week. Steel Hagenbuch has already logged 316 kilometers’ worth of rollerskiing across 17.5 hours’ worth of training time. This would not be out of place as the cumulative rollerski training load for a top World Cup skier — which Steel Hagenbuch demonstrably is — for the entire week.\n\n(There’s a lot of different ways to get to 25–30 hours in a week, and individual athletes will adjust ratios for individual needs and capabilities, but 15+ hours of rollerskiing, 7–10 hours of foot or foot with poles, a couple hours for strength, and the rest on the bike or other training modalities would not surprise me in a high-end skier’s training log.)\n\nSteel Hagenbuch, for his part, has hit this mark by Wednesday afternoon.\n\nWednesday afternoon: 29-mile road bike ride\n\nSlightly less than one hour later, Steel Hagenbuch is back out the door on a Wednesday night group ride, his first non-rollerski training of the week. I’m glad he’s giving his upper body a rest, I guess?\n\nBut not so much his legs. Dude claims the KOM on a popular climb plus several other segment top-10s in the process; he is not going slowly out there. Though he does this all with a MHR of 175 and an average HR of 142, a difficult achievement for most people. But Steel Hagenbuch, if you had any doubt whatsoever remaining by this point, is not most people. (Is he even human? Discuss.)\n\nThursday morning: 60km rollerski\n\nThursday early afternoon: Track workout\n\nThursday evening: 40km rollerski\n\n“This is the most sicko double day of all time,” one admiring/appalled commenter had written on Strava of Wednesday’s exertions.\n\nIf you found Wednesday notable, and you probably should, then get ready for Thursday. The morning session brought another 60km of rollerskiing… early afternoon saw a track workout… and then the evening saw 40km more rollerskiing to hit an even 100km for the day. That is, combined, 100km and 5:38 of rollerskiing, plus another 48 minutes on foot. My goodness.\n\nBack to that track session for a second:\n\nThe morning’s rollerski workout commenced at 9:19 a.m. and had an elapsed time of 3:34 (against a moving time of 3:22; dude spent a whopping 12 minutes total stopped to eat, drink, or photograph in a 3.5-hour ski), so Steel Hagenbuch was on his feet on rollerskis until 12:53 p.m.\n\nA full 30 minutes later, at 1:23 p.m., a warmup run for a track session ensues. Assuming that it took, say, just five minutes total to remove and stow rollerski gear and put on running gear, that leaves 25 minutes’ worth of transition time. I hope that the intermezzo from ca. 12:56–1:21 p.m. was luxuriant. And filled with a lot of food, given the 60-kilometer rollerski just concluded.\n\n… but maybe not too much food, because now it was time for, I think, 8 x 400 on the track.\n\nAnd that’s still not all! A little less than three hours later, it was time for the final 40km of rollerskiing on the day. This bagatelle of a workout — at 40 kilometers it was the shortest rollerski of the week lol — commenced at 5:13 p.m., and saw our hero out on the roads until 7:48 p.m. Sunset in Hanover on September 5 was at 7:09 p.m., with civil twilight concluding at 7:37 p.m. Suffice to say that Steel Hagenbuch is not going gentle into that good night out there.\n\nFriday morning: 110-mile road bike ride\n\n110 miles, 7,200 feet, just under 6 hours on the bike. In the abstract, this is substantial, but not an atypical weekend long ride for a dedicated roadie. In practice… suffice to say that your typical weekend warrior road cyclist has not logged 416 kilometers of rollerskiing in the past four days as warmup.\n\nFriday afternoon: (nothing)\n\nAnd on the afternoon of the fifth day, John Steel Hagenbuch rested.\n\nSaturday: 145km rollerski\n\n“This activity is John Steel’s longest roller ski on Strava!” reads a cheerful badge accompanying this entry. Joyce’s longest sentence, Faulkner’s longest paragraph, and John Isner’s longest tennis match are all jealous.\n\nThis, for me, is where the entire enterprise shifts from the deeply impressive but still theoretically intelligible to the simply obscene. Over eight hours on rollerskis. Nearly 10 hours on his feet total elapsed time. In the rain. 561 kilometers of rollerskiing for the week.\n\nThis is beyond real. This is hyperreal. Move over, Disneyland; Baudrillard has new fodder for analysis here. I bet he was a huge nordic ski fan.\n\nSunday: 5.5-hour, 34-mile run\n\nAn easy five-and-a-half hours on his feet to finish things off. No big deal. Plus the week’s first and only photograph of an actual shrimp; I respect the extended buildup to this final sight gag.\n\nFor the week, that totals, per Strava, 45 hours of training time on the nose. 852km total distance, with 11,769 meters of elevation gain (that’s 529 miles and 38,600 feet in American). This is two weeks’ worth of training for some pro skiers. A month’s worth of training for an ambitious citizen racer. Six to even eight weeks’ worth of training for some midpack skiers. All in seven days.\n\nThese totals are, well, obscene, but are not too far outside the standard range for high-volume endurance sport athletes. I was going to write something like, “pro triathletes log 40-hour weeks pretty consistently,” but one Kristian Blummenfelt (2020 Olympic gold medalist) doesn’t have anything over 35 hours listed on his Strava from the last year, so, ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.\n\nTurning to speedskating, Nils van der Poel, who by any standard was an outlier, built an aerobic base off of 33 hours of largely stationary cycling within a week a five-day training week… but he also writes, “If I wanted to go for a trip with my friends Thursday–Sunday I would squeeze in 30 hours of training Monday–Wednesday and then have four days of no training.” van der Poel retired two years ago with world records and Olympic gold medals in both the 5,000m and 10,000m to his name, so the somewhat outré training distribution of 33 hours in five days — or even 30 hours in three days — seems to have worked for him.\n\nCloser to home, and back to this sport, Noah Hoffman stacked up 35-hour weeks pretty consistently during what I would describe as his infamous year of infamous hours, in which he increased his hours to a round 1,000, from something like 750 the season prior, in an attempt to become the fittest athlete in the men’s World Cup field.\n\nAnd while the precise training of the APU Elite Team is a state secret around these parts, it is safe to assume that multiple men in Anchorage logged at least 30 hours a week on several occasions this past summer. Indeed, here’s APU athlete Garrett Butts referring to “another 4 digit season of training in the log” for the 2022/2023 training year, and here he is earlier this month discussing “get[ting] dug out of a hole while training 27+ hours/week.” If you’re at a 1000+ hours for the season overall, and you have any degree of periodization for a several-month race season, simple math suggests that you’re going to be around 30 hours/week for much of the summer.\n\n… finally, Kílian Jornet seems to have logged 268 hours in one recent 19-day binge of linking up all 82 Alpine peaks over 4,000 meters under only human power — that’s roughly 14 hours a day, or 98 hours a week, for nearly three weeks straight. But his Strava for this, while perhaps the single most impressive Strava entry of all time, only mentions bike and feet, so Steel Hagenbuch still gets the nod here on rollerski time.\n\nIn conclusion, unless you are John Steel Hagenbuch or someone else of his ilk, you should not train this much volume. (And if you are that good a skier, there’s no way you’ll be taking training advice from me, anyway.) But no matter how long you’re going for, you should probably go easier than you think you need to, and eat more food than you think you need to, to help make it sustainable. I hear that shrimp are pretty nutrient-dense, and a good source of protein.\n\nYou’re reading this on Nordic Insights, one man’s labor of love dedicated to publicizing American nordic skiing. Last season’s GoFundMe is literally the only reason why I turned a profit in year one of Nordic Insights, and in turn the only reason why there is a year two of Nordic Insights for you to be reading now: I was okay with working for very little money to get this love letter to American cross-country skiing off the ground, but I didn’t want to lose money for the privilege of doing so. If you would like to support what remains a brutally shoestring operation, this season’s GoFundMe may be found here. Thank you for your consideration, and, especially, for reading.",

You can get your Strava activities to the Freeletics app as Strava do still offer Google Fit integration, which integrates very well with Google Health\n\nHere’s one I did earlier\n\nStrava ride in Google Fit\n\nAnd here it is in the app\n\nHi Ben,\n\nmany thanks for the quick and extremely helpful response!\n\nConnecting Strava via Google Fit with Google Health to then be connected with Freeletics was exactly what I was looking for. Still a strange constellation (from Google’s structure) but it’s the result that matters.\n\nThanks again and best wishes,\n\nJan",
      "# [Strava was used to locate the most powerful people](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41988760)\nStrava is a fitness app. So, apprently, the security detachment of political figures tends to use the app, presumably because they're into fitness and keep in shape, and their location can be tracked through the app.\n\nAs the security detachment tend to travel with the people they protect, political leaders locations can be inferred.\n\nThe article talks about body guards not being allowed to use social media/apps while on the job, they allow for provisions on use when not on active duty. So, I guess, the guards get a day off, use the app, wherever they are, broadcasting their location.\n\nCrazy stuff.\n\nYeah, the targetting isn't that difficult, I guess. If you know crown prince Akeem Joffer was in New York 5 days ago, and is in Paris 3 days ago, you can probably diligently query Strava users who weren't in New York for a long time but showed up 5 days ago, and see if they showed up in Paris 3 days ago, and boom, you've found a member of his entourage.\n\nEven if they use the anonymizing feature that masks their start/end points, if you find a few other members, you could be able to triangulate a big hotel near them and guess that that's where the crown prince stayed... and the next time you hear he's coming to NY/Paris, you have this information.\n\nCell phone tracking is better at surveillance than the best stuff the military has.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/02/22/... has a fun story about a time at Fort Irwin (US Army laser tag in the desert) one side couldn't figure out how an attack helicopter got through their defenses, until they did some queries on a commercial cell phone tracking database and found the cellphone moving across the desert at 120mph. Hole identified, plugged for the next round.\n\nAnd also talks about how the Ukrainians and Russians are having a great deal of trouble with cell phone OPSEC even after years of shooting war.\n\nAll to often \"bad guys\" are just a fig leaf for the absolute worst guys.\n\n“Now the police dreams that one look at the gigantic map on the office wall should suffice at any given moment to establish who is related to whom and in what degree of intimacy; and, theoretically, this dream is not unrealizable although its technical execution is bound to be somewhat difficult. If this map really did exist, not even memory would stand in the way of the totalitarian claim to domination; such a map might make it possible to obliterate people without any traces, as if they had never existed at all.”\n\n- Hannah Arendt\n\n> has easily won every armed conflict they've entered into in the past 50 years\n\nThat's just false. Ok, maybe you don't count Vietnam, because the US \"entered\" there in the '60s, but Afghanistan was a sure loss and I'd say the same for Iraq (seeing how it's now in Iran's sphere of influence, which it wasn't under Saddam). Yes, they might have won some tactical battles, most probably all of them, come to think of it, but the wars themselves were lost.\n\nPeople don't like hearing this, but military tech and civilian tech move more-or-less in lockstep. We see this in Ukraine, where both sides are using Consumer-off-the-shelf drones for violent means with minimal modification. You could argue that Ukraine's defense is an even more novel form of warfare than what the United States is comfortable dealing with.\n\nWhen two armies fight each other, what determines who gets power-gapped is the way each military operationalizes new technology. The United States defense sector does an excellent job of staying on top of new advancements, but when you examine the Cold War and WWII, most of America's tech is civilian-grade but implemented with world-class logistics and command/control.\n\nThis is why I only use Strava to share with my followers.\n\nYes, it's an extra step after my workout to edit, add pics if any, choose my activity level if I was too lazy to put on my HR monitor, and then only post to my followers.\n\nYes, this means I get less likes and can't participate in challenges etc. But it's really about sharing with my colleagues and friends so they can motivate me for my next ride.\n\nYou claimed that \"this\" is why you choose a private mode on Strava. But this attack is irrelevant to you. I totally believe you want privacy -- and that's fine -- and Strava provides you a mode that suits your desires.\n\nI'm taking issue with your statement that locating powerful people is somehow a threat model that is relevant to you. It isn't.\n\n> a bad actor watching your profile could infer your movements on Strava (or lack thereof) and use that to break into your home or steal your ride.\n\nEveryone using Strava who thinks this is relevant to their threat model is free to use the hidden address privacy feature, or the myriad other privacy features.\n\nAt the end of the day, Strava is an app for sharing your data. You have a lot of options for how much you want to share or limit that sharing. If you don't want to share anything ever, it probably isn't for you.\n\nStrava deserves all the blames it get, but don't you need some serious skills to find out who are the agents guarding Biden/Harris/Trump? I mean, if you can literally track down the names of Secret Service agents guarding VIPs, then you can probably easily track them with other means (phone for example) no?\n\nSpeaking out of most likely ignorance of Secret Service, I was in the US Marines. I dealt with marine snipers a few times during training exercises, we were mainly serve as security protections. I've seen them train, shoot and handle combat scenarios. If any of those marine snipers want to take shot at a VIP, I can't imagine Secret Service will be able to do anything to stop it. Some of the snipers are putting rounds into a postal stamp at 1,000 yard / 900 meters.\n\nThere is no reward for getting the best time. Also, the people that you beat are extremely motivated to investigate and flag your activity; it will look pretty obvious that it was ridden on an e-bike due to incorrect / missing data like heart rate and wattage.\n\nI have the record on a short inconsequential running course near me. I occasionally get a notification that someone beat my record and I am forced to look at it; it is always someone on a bike or car, and I flag it and it eventually goes away. Also, my own record activity has been flagged multiple times despite it only being slightly faster than the second place finisher - I no longer bother trying to contest it. The joke is on the flagger since I have run the exact same record time, several times, so I still have the course record.\n\nIt's even possible to do dumb stuff in pursuit of a personal best without using an app at all.\n\nBut it should be noted that the Strava user in question doesn't seem to have been cheating. For some reason, they were trying to set a legitimate score in an ill-advised way. There's no evidence here that cheating in Strava is a problem.\n\nIs Strava promoting unsafe riding? Maybe. I don't really think so. But it's not connected to the cheating question.\n\nIt's fun. Don't take the leaderboards too seriously. The kind of people that would care about high placement at any cost tend not to be the kind of people who care about strava. (mostly)\n\nPeople that can legitimately get a KOM on a segment tend to be known in a local community. If someone new shows up at #1, it's pretty obvious looking at their workout if its legit or not to someone familiar with the sport.\n\nWhat's the point of wikipedia? Can't people just easily publish fake information? Like what happens if I make an article about myself?\n\nIt's pretty much a solved problem.",
      "# [Strava Privacy Update Nov'24 on 2024-11-16](https://forum.intervals.icu/t/strava-privacy-update-nov24/79940)\nActivities from Strava will soon only be visible to the athlete that performed the activity, not to their coaches or followers and not via intervals.icu API. This is a new addition to the Strava API terms and conditions. I plan to make this change from the 1st of December.\n\nI know a lot of people use Strava to get activities from Zwift into Intervals.icu. The good news is that direct Intervals.icu Zwift integration (planned workouts and completed activities) is almost complete!\n\nIf you are coaching someone on Intervals.icu and they are using Strava then you need to get them to setup direct Intervals.icu integration as soon as possible.\n\nThis is what I received from Strava:\n\nIn our efforts to further fortify trust and safety within our community, developers will no longer be permitted to expose user data that is obtained via our API within their app to any party outside of that user.\n\nYour app has been identified as now being in conflict with the updated terms and in order for your application to be compliant, we ask that you:\n\nMake the necessary updates to your app with regards to your Strava integration such that any future Strava data is only accessible to the authenticated user who provides such data.\n\nUpdate the visibility of all historic Strava data within your application such that any data is only visible to the authenticated user who provided that data.\n\nNotify users of your application of such changes to the extent required by your Privacy Policy, our API Agreement, or applicable law.\n\nWe ask that you kindly make these updates within the next 30 days in order to be compliant with our updated terms.\n\nIn one sense, this is a step in the right direction from Strava, but true to their recent form, they have also gone several steps in the wrong direction at the same time. They don’t seem to be able to land in the happy middle these days.\n\nRight now it’s possible to see private Strava activities of my friends in Intervals, as in activities that they have set to fully private in Strava. This is not a good thing for a number of very obvious reasons.\n\nBut if Strava’s change here is only to protect users from their private activities being visible (and I doubt it is their sole intention), then the best course of action would be to not serve private activity data via API. Job done. They could, perhaps, require that users approve the sharing of private activity data when linking a 3rd party service to Strava or further break down the permissions structure. It’s common for users to select from several check boxes to customize the level of data sharing they approve when linking accounts.\n\nAlternately they could require the third party to not show private activities to anyone but the user, or even allow the user to toggle visibility of these activities to others in the 3rd party app ( though these 2 are much more work to enforce for Strava). A simple flag for activity visibility status in Strava would make quick work for all (this probably already exists).\n\nInstead, Strava is making a drastic change they know will significantly affect their users. While privacy & protection of their users might be their public explanation, you have to wonder if this isn’t just a justification for nerfing 3rd party app usefulness in an attempt to lock users into the Strava ecosystem, and try to sell more premium subscriptions. Maybe Strava wants to eventually launch a feature for coaches?\n\nStrava knows that their analysis, even for premium users, is pretty shallow and useless for serious athletes. Intervals is absolutely kicking the ass of everything else out there, which is why I’m more than happy to pay to support it and have zero desire to pay for Strava ever again. I can’t help but feel that Strava is feeling pressure to stop sharing data for free from their VC investors, and is taking the opportunity here to try and hurt the competition. Shades of Reddit nerfing their API…\n\nPretty draconian move by Strava, and a reminder that no one truly owns any data they share with a social media company. They can cut off your access whenever they please.",
      "# [I built a bike for a 22km Strava segment that nobody was going for, and I’d do it again in a heartbeat by Will Jones on 2024-07-20](https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/i-built-a-bike-for-a-22km-strava-segment-that-nobody-was-going-for-and-id-do-it-again-in-a-heartbeat/)\nOne of the great privileges of this job is, within reason, access to more or less anything the bike industry can produce. I’ve seen colleagues create bike builds for events, gravel superbikes or aero missiles, all well-curated and thought out. Until now, primarily because bike events don’t really appeal to me, I’ve not leapt into building specific, but now here we are… I’ve gone and built a hill climb bike with a twist.\n\nMy local club, Newtown Park CC, runs its Hills and Pils ride every Wednesday. The route goes up 13 of the nastiest hills that Bristol, a famously hilly place, has to offer, all of them short and steep, many hitting 15% and some approaching 20%. In 22.2km the route packs in 553m of elevation gain before it finishes at a brewery (hence the Pils), and the current KOM, for the whole route as one segment, was a smidge under an hour at 54:58. Given I have a background in cyclocross, the opportunity to make my eyes pop for an hour in a new way was too good to pass up.\n\nIt must be said that going for the KOM is very much against the ethos of the club, which prides itself on being non-competitive, and the done thing on the ride itself is to wait at the top of every hill for the last rider in the group, and roll together to the foot of the next one before any smashing takes place. As such, I did it alone on a Thursday.\n\nWhile I do like the thought of giving other riders the impetus to go after the KOM (or maybe FKT, though it’s perhaps a bit short for that), it’s a route that takes place in an inner city environment with plenty of traffic lights and junctions so… don’t try this at home. And so to the bike…\n\nA hill climb bike with a twist\n\nBefore being overhauled in a big way, my Hills and Pils bike, for that is now what it is called, was a relatively normal Bowman Palace:R. A fun, but pretty run-of-the-mill rim brake alloy frameset that I bought primarily because it had a threaded bottom bracket and external cables. It served me well, but was tired in many ways. I’d always fancied a flat bar road bike, mostly for vibe reasons rather than anything performance-oriented, and so initially I just wanted to do a flat bar conversion and leave it at that.\n\nThe paint was knackered, so once the parts had all been removed I rode it up to an old motorcycle workshop and paid a man to give it a nice hot bath in acid, resulting in this lovely matte silver finish.\n\nI’ve already put together a pretty comprehensive guide to making your road bike into a flat bar machine, but the short story was new shifters, a set of Paul brake levers (for the bling factor) that I had in a box, a 150mm Zipp stem and some PRO Koryak bars. Initially, I kept my standard road wheels on, and used the same Thomson seatpost as I had used for years, but these got upgraded presently.\n\nA very noodly ride\n\nOne thing I really noticed initially was the huge increase in perceived flex that came from swapping to flat bars. Initially, the bars themselves were 720mm wide, and while the additional leverage was great on the steep hills the setup imparted a huge amount of torsion on the frame while seated. So wobbly did it feel that I even stopped halfway around the route on a test ride one evening to check the frame wasn’t cracked.\n\nAfter that, I had to reduce the leverage, chopping the bars down to a more reasonable 660mm, which helped a huge amount. It still feels flexible at times, but it’s no longer enough to actually scare me.\n\nWeight weenieism, within reason\n\nIt would have been possible to go overboard here and just try and make it the lightest bike possible, but I wanted to keep it usable. Hill climb bikes are often amazing at going uphill, but this one had to be able to go down too, and on the flat for some sections, so 1x was out for starters. The old Ultegra 6800 didn’t have anything wrong with it, and 52/36 and 11-28 was about right that the lowest gear was still reasonably fast, with plenty of beans for any downhills. There are a couple of hills where, if you get the momentum and traffic lights right, you can tackle them in the big ring and gain a load of time, so another reason not to go 1x.\n\nThe wheels were the first big swap. While the alloy set built for me by Ryan from RyanBuildsWheels was perfect for generally bashing about, there’s no denying that the Hunt 36 Carbon Wide Aero wheels were lighter, whilst still not being so outlandish and boutique that I’d be scared to hit one of the innumerable potholes that litter Bristol’s streets.\n\nThomson seatposts are cool, but they don’t half weigh a lot. Something I’d always been curious to try was an unpadded saddle, and so I reached out to Slovenian boutique carbon outfit Bjørn, and borrowed a Sedlo saddle and Glagol seatpost. Yes, this goes against what I said about the wheels, but this is less likely to crack when faced with a pothole. I’d used the saddle shape before when I tested a fully custom titanium Sturdy, and while the cutout was great, it was the ramp at the back that appealed. A lot of the climbs are best tackled out of the saddle, but some are on the limit of what’s doable seated, and when that happens the rear lip stops me sliding off the rear, especially with a greater nose-down tilt than I would ordinarily run.\n\nThe only other concession to weight weenieism was the 12-gram Topeak Feza G12 bottle cage. It’s very light, looks cool, but is also incredibly secure. When it came to actually taking on the segment I rarely found myself drinking though, so I could easily have jettisonned it entirely along with the bottle and saved a good 500g. Hindsight is 20:20.\n\nI could easily have swapped the Paul levers out too, given they weigh a tonne each, but to be honest they look so cool I decided it wasn’t worth it. The total weight was 7.6kg, including pedals, cage, computer, saddlebag, and empty water bottle. Not superlight, but for a relatively cheap alloy bike it's not half bad either.\n\nA pedal dilemma\n\nInitially I built the bike up with a set of Crank Brothers eggbeater pedals, not because I ever planned on unclipping and reclipping with ease, or for any weight considerations, but because the bike would almost exclusively be used on rides that finished at a brewery, and walking around in gravel shoes is a lot easier. For the segment though I swapped these out for road pedals. It’s minor, but the stability feels better, especially in my road shoes.\n\nA tyre conundrum\n\nSo far this bike has had three sets of tyres, and will soon have a fourth. Initially I fit up the Hunt wheels with Michelin Power Cups, my favourite budget tyre, but the rim and tyre combo didn’t play so well together and the tyres stubbornly refused to seat properly even with tubes. Off they came, and on went a set of Vittoria Corsa N.Ext. Same tread as the Corsa Pro, but in a vulcanised rubber casing to ward off punctures a bit.\n\nThese will probably get re-fitted in due course and set up tubeless to actually fight off punctures, but for the segment run itself I threw caution to the wind and slapped on a fresh set of 28c S-Works Turbo Cotton Hell of the North tyres with latex tubes in them. It’s such an easy win in terms of performance it seemed daft not to, and the segment is on my doorstep so I figured if I flatted I could just try again the next day.\n\nA few final details\n\nWhile I tended to use a Hammerhead as my main computer, I had recently fried it using a duff charger. Fortunately, I also have a wee little Wahoo Bolt too, which was perfect. I knew the route pretty well, but never being one for riding to power, I simply ran it with the map on the screen along with the total time and average speed, with the targets I needed to hit for these metrics taped to the massive stem for reference.\n\nOne thing I did swap that was a surprisingly great upgrade was the brake cables. Since feeling the lever feel of my colleague Tom’s Cannondale SuperSix before he embarked on the Paris-Roubaix sportive, I have been chasing a similar setup for my rim brake bikes. Shimano no longer makes its highest quality, polymer-coated cables with MTB ends as the MTB world has long since gone hydraulic and disc brake, so instead I opted for Jagwire road link outers combined with Jagwire MTB inners.\n\nIt’s not quite as smooth, but it saved a few grams and the lever feel is vastly better than it was with the cheap housing that was on before. You’d be amazed how much more confidence you have in the brakes when the lever feedback is pleasant; especially important on steep, twisty inner city descents.\n\nA proper spares kit\n\nWhile I was prepared to risk a flat, I was not prepared to then walk home, so still ran a proper saddlebag complete with spare butyl tube, big tyre levers, a small multi-tool, and a diminutive Birzman Apogee mini pump.\n\nAll enough to get me home and live to fight another day. I’ve taken to securing it with an additional Voile Nano strap, as I find it stops any rattling that may occur. Worth the handful of grams in my view.\n\nNo aero bars\n\nSomething I toyed with in testing was a set of mini Sirocco clip-on aero bars from Controltech. They did allow me to get into a more aero position, but in testing, I found the times when I actually had the opportunity to get into them for any length of time were minimal. There’s one flat section at the end of the route around an area of parkland, but in actuality, I could more or less replicate the position they offered by just holding the bars by the stem and dropping my elbows a bit lower.\n\nA very fast pair of socks\n\nMy clothing could have been more optimal, but it was cold when I gave it a crack so a non-aero long-sleeve jersey went on. I had recently been sent what were claimed to be the fastest socks in the world from Sockeloen, at times apparently used by Mathieu van der Poel, so I slapped these on, but that was it.\n\nWell, did you get it?\n\nYes, just. The route is front-loaded pretty heavily, so it was only in the final 15 minutes or so that I thought I’d make it. In reality, it was more of an excuse to tinker and transform a bike as completely as possible, but it was certainly satisfying to find the mods had paid off. I can’t quite shake the feeling that a relatively decent road bike with disc brakes would probably be faster, but it wouldn’t be nearly so fun, and it certainly wouldn’t have been as cheap, and it’s kept an old bike going which is always good.\n\nI would love someone else to go after it, and there are stronger riders than myself in the club who could easily do it, but to go any faster myself would probably take some unsafe riding, which isn't worth the associated risks.\n\nI might try and continue to optimise the bike more, perhaps with some carbon chainrings, maybe some ultralight wheels, but to be honest I think I’ll actually slap some more sturdy tubeless tyres on it and leave it as a wicked fast pub bike.\n\nAlso, I should shout out my clubmate Liv who took the QOM the day before and basically made me decide to go for it the next day.",
      "# [Strava’s Big Changes Aim To Kill Off Apps by Ray Maker on 2024-11-19](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/11/stravas-changes-to-kill-off-apps.html)\nYesterday Strava sent out an e-mail to users, outlining a change that’s occurring almost immediately, regarding 3rd party apps and the way apps are allowed to access and process data from Strava. All of these changes impact what is known as the Strava API (Application Programming Interface). That’s the piece that lets your Garmin watch push your workout to Strava, and then lets an app like VeloViewer or others access your data.\n\nThere are countless apps that use Strava’s API, literally tens of thousands according to Strava. Some of these are tiny, some of them are massive. Virtually every company in the space uses Strava’s API, including Garmin, Wahoo, TrainerRoad, VeloViewer, Xert, and plenty more. It’s become the defacto data hub for millions of athletes, some 100m+ according to Strava’s press release.\n\nIn any event, the e-mail Strava sent out, as you can see below, is pretty bland, and doesn’t really get into things:\n\nInstead, you need to crack open the included link to start understanding the implications. All of which roughly boils down to two main items (but a bunch of smaller things), there’s three biggies:\n\n#1: “Third-party apps are no longer able to display your Strava activity data on their surfaces to other users.”\n\n#2: “We’re updating our terms to explicitly prohibit third parties from using any data obtained via Strava’s API in artificial intelligence models or other similar applications.”\n\n#3: “You may not process or disclose Strava Data…for the purposes of, including but not limited to, analytics, analyses…”\n\nThey also included language that apps are somehow not allowed to replicate Strava’s “distinctive look and feel”, which…ok. And more hilariously, they added that any users posting to their community hub forums that are “requesting or attempting to have Strava revert business decisions will not be permitted” and summarily deleted.\n\nSaid differently: Do not discuss the community things you don’t like in the community.\n\nBut again, the big three that matter here are:\n\n#1: Apps can’t show your data beyond yourself\n\n#2: Apps can’t use any “AI” whatsoever in their processing of your data\n\n#3: Apps can’t do any analytics or data processing of your data\n\nTo understand how ridiculous these are, let’s outline some real-world apps you’re probably familiar with.\n\nBreaking Coaching and Comparison Apps:\n\nThe first item (not showing data beyond yourself) immediately breaks almost all coaching apps that have connections to Strava. This includes apps like Final Surge, Xert, and Intervals.icu. These are apps that pull in your Strava data (as you requested) to analyze on your platform. For visual reference, this:\n\nNow you may be wondering why they don’t just go directly to Garmin, Wahoo, etc… That’d be more effective, right? And indeed it is, and most of these apps do. Except there are literally thousands of device manufacturers out there, and many of them only connect to Strava.\n\nTake for example the AmazFit T-Rex watch I’m testing right now. That doesn’t connect to Final Surge. Or Xert. Or TrainerRoad. Or much else. It does connect to Strava though, so, my data uploads to Strava and I’m done – off it goes to all my authorized apps. The same is true for the Google Pixel Watch. Or Samsung’s Galaxy watches. Below is a good example of how I can get all those data types into Strava.\n\nStrava benefits because they’ve become the defacto platform of choice for consumers. Companies benefit because they don’t need never-ending connections to platforms. And consumers benefit because everything ‘just works’. That’s the goal, right? Just working?\n\nWell, not anymore.\n\nWith this change, apps that do any sort of coaching on their platform are not allowed to show the end users data to their coach. The new API terms and conditions explicitly prohibit this:\n\n“you may not disclose such data to, or use it for, another user nor any other third party.”\n\nIn fact, the popular training and coaching platform Intervals.icu already posted this breaks all coaching features for them related to Strava data – requiring them to hide not only new user data going forward, but all historical data for coaches.\n\n“Activities from Strava will soon only be visible to the athlete that performed the activity, not to their coaches or followers. This is a new addition to the Strava API terms and conditions.”\n\nBut it also breaks plenty of other apps that aren’t coaching apps – but merely showing Strava data. For example, apps like VeloViewer, which curates your lists of segments for deeper analytics and competition among groups, breaks. Same goes for all of their leaderboards for Zwift. Or their challenges. Or the listing of other people’s efforts (when you click on ‘View on Veloviewer’ from any of these below. All of it – going to be killed off if apps follow the letter of the law.\n\nLike these details:\n\nThe challenge with these changes, is that practically speaking, unless you have a Garmin or other big-name device with a proper and well-documented public and easy to access API, all of these apps won’t set up connections to those device platforms directly. They can’t in some cases, and it won’t be feasible in most to service all of these app requests. Even seemingly big players like Wahoo, Hammerhead/SRAM, and Polar don’t have easily accessible APIs that scale well to the number of requests that are going to be required here.\n\nNo Analysis of Data Apps:\n\nBut wait, there’s more. Strava’s new API agreement also makes clear that you can’t do ‘year in review’ type summaries either. In fact, it actually says you can’t do any analytics or processing of the data:\n\n“You may not process or disclose Strava Data, even publically viewable Strava Data, including in an aggregated or de-identified manner, for the purposes of, including but not limited to, analytics, analyses, customer insights generation, and products or services improvements. Strava Data may not be combined with other customer data, for these or any other purposes.\n\nIn fact, as one major app pointed out to me, the above paragraph basically says you can’t do anything with any data at all. While portions of the above entry existed in previous API versions, this paragraph has now been expanded to be more precise.\n\nWith the above line, you can’t do much of anything. You want to show a user how many miles they ran that week? Nope, not according to the letter of the law as that’s ‘processing’ for the purposes of ‘analytics’. You want to show them how hard their workout was compared to a year ago? Nope, can’t do that either, that’s ‘processing’ for the purposes of ‘analysis’. Want to create a heat map tile like VeloViewer has? Nope, that’s “aggregated” data for “insights generation”:\n\nWhile Strava lawyers might try and say perhaps that line is there to prevent something else, any non-lawyer or lawyer would argue the opposite in court if they had to. That single paragraph basically says apps can’t do anything at all. Period.\n\nThe problem here is that Strava’s API terms are so broad and wonky now, that the API no longer serves a purpose, as stated by the above paragraph.\n\nNonetheless, I went back to Strava and asked them questions about many of these topics, trying to get clarification to see if this was a misunderstanding, they completely ignored the questions I had, and responded with:\n\n“These changes were implemented to provide additional safeguards around our community’s data and to help ensure that a user’s Strava data can only be viewed by others on third-party apps in limited scenarios where sharing is both transparent and central to the functionality of the app. We recognize this is a change and are committed to working closely with partners during this transition.”\n\nPoint being, I gave them an opportunity to clarify things or set the record straight, and they said ‘nah’.\n\nAdd to that, they don’t seem all that committed to “working closely with partners”. As every single partner I’ve talked to over the last 24 hours has been completely broadsided by this change. They all received a generic e-mail Friday night, with a mere 30 days of notice to completely re-work their entire applications. Mind you, a 30-day period that includes the holidays (most companies would give at least 6 months of notice for something like this).\n\nI suspect we’ll see a lot of companies just shut off the API entirely, and perhaps that’s Strava’s goal. Though, I fail to see how that benefits paying Strava subscribers, and thus Strava’s bottom line. Strava seems to be working very hard to kill off the community of tens of thousands of apps that arguably made it so popular.\n\nNo AI Usage & Analytics:\n\nThe next issue is just as crazy as the the others. It says that 3rd party apps may not use artificial intelligence processing in any way, for your data coming from Strava. Specifically, it stays the following:\n\n“You may not use the Strava API Materials (including Strava Data), directly or indirectly, for any model training related to artificial intelligence, machine learning or similar applications.”\n\nOf course, the term “machine learning or similar applications” basically means “you may not do any processing at all” on it, especially when combined with the above ‘no analytics’ clauses.\n\nThis particular line item immediately kills apps like TrainerRoad and Xert using data from Strava, but also countless other apps that pull in your own workout data via Strava, and then use some sort of processing to analyze it. Machine learning is hardly new or fancy. And putting in there “similar applications”, what on earth does that mean?\n\nTrainerRoad and others use “AI” (however they want to define it), according to their marketing, and thus, in less than 30 days, they’ll have to cease their entire platform, or, disconnect Strava.\n\nIn the case of platforms like TrainerRoad, I suspect they’ll simply disable Strava altogether, and force everyone through direct connections. This will be fine for Garmin users, but as of right now there’s no inbound connection for Wahoo users (though that’s coming). And for people pushing Zwift workouts to TrainerRoad, that too will break until TrainerRoad completes their API connection in January.\n\nBut that won’t solve the larger issue TrainerRoad and other companies face, which is having to pull in the other 3rd party workout data types. TrainerRoad doesn’t have a connection to Suunto. Or Polar. Or AmazFit. Or Google. Or Fitbit. Or…I could do this all day. Strava solved that, to the benefit of both consumers and all companies involved.\n\nNow Strava seems to want to own the “AI space” with its always-helpful AI insights that simply re-word my activity titles and tell me something vaguely positive but usually wrong.\n\nAfter publishing this post and video, Strava has issued an update in response. Note, they didn’t reach out or respond to me with the text, but did respond to The Verge where the updated text was originally issued, before publishing it on Strava’s own newsroom site. The Verge e-mailed me the update with permission to use, prior to Strava’s posting. Here’s the full text of the update:\n\nUpdated on Nov. 19\n\nWe wanted to provide some additional context around the changes to our API Agreement and the impact for our users and developers. We currently anticipate these changes will impact less than .1% of applications and proactively notified the majority of those affected last week.\n\nEnhanced Privacy and User Control\n\nPrivacy and user control are at the forefront of our platform. As a result, we are committed to evolving our API practices as regulatory requirements and user expectations shift. This includes the decision to limit the ability of a user’s data to be displayed by third-party apps in ways the user may not expect. Specifically, we want to thoughtfully address situations where users connect to a third-party app and are unaware that their data is being surfaced not just for their own use and visibility, but also to other users (for example, in a public feed or heatmap). The latest API changes address this scenario and provide a more consistent framework for Strava user data.\n\nTraining AI Models\n\nWe believe in the potential of AI to transform the athlete experience–whether it’s delivering more personalized insights to help you reach your goals, generating route or training recommendations, or countless other possibilities. But innovation in this space must be handled responsibly and with a firm focus on user control. As part of our generative AI features, we are committed to implementing thoughtful solutions that prioritize user control and the ability to opt out.\n\nThird-party developers may not take such a deliberate approach to training AI models and as a result, we believe the best decision for the platform and for users is to prohibit the use of data extracted from Strava users in this manner. Our previous terms already disallowed the use of Strava user data in model training and development but we’ve made this more explicit in light of the increasing activity in this space.\n\nNo Impact to Most Developers\n\nWe recognize that our platform thrives because of the creativity and dedication of third-party developers who build tools to complement and extend Strava’s capabilities. We are steadfast in our commitment to fostering this ecosystem. We anticipate that these changes will affect only a small fraction (less than .1%) of the applications on the Strava platform–the overwhelming majority of existing use cases are still allowed, including coaching platforms focused on providing feedback to users and tools that help users understand their data and performance.\n\nCollectively, these changes reflect our commitment to ensuring that Strava remains a trusted platform for athletes and developers alike. That means holding ourselves—and anyone building on our platform—to high standards.\n\nHowever, ultimately, it doesn’t actually change things – in fact, kinda doubles down on it. In it, Strava basically says three things:\n\nA) 3rd party apps can’t show data beyond the user itself. Just as before, this still breaks coaching apps. Strava tries to confuse people by saying “the overwhelming majority of existing use cases are still allowed, including coaching platforms focused on providing feedback to users and tools that help users understand their data and performance.” – however, what they’re actually saying is 3rd party coaching apps can provide feedback, as long as that’s computational feedback. Coaching apps still cannot let human coaches see the data. Had that been the case, Strava would have simply said that, and notified coaching apps. They’ve done neither, and multiple coaching apps I’ve talked to have confirmed Strava hasn’t changed their position, but has scheduled meetings to talk about the impacts.\n\nB) Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is still prohibited. Again, Strava tries to keep distracting people by saying “training models” is not permitted. Yet the terms are very clear, both training and usage isn’t permitted. Still, as any company can tell you, even if it were just training (which again, it isn’t), these models can’t get better without training on the same data for whatever application purpose they are using. After all, last I checked, Strava themselves doesn’t give us permission to allow/deny their access to our data for AI training purposes.\n\nC) “No impact to most developers” – In the update, they say “We anticipate that these changes will affect only a small fraction (less than .1%) of the applications on the Strava platform”. Except, that’s the most disingenuous way of writing it. Strava has tens of thousands of connected applications, the vast majority of which are tiny hobbyist applications that may have 1 user or a handful of users. Instead, it’s the big-ticket applications that matter here with the most users. Strava isn’t saying 0.1% of users, just 0.1% of applications.\n\n–\n\nUltimately, it seems like Strava’s API itself needs an update if Strava believes users need more control. And to be clear – I’m 100% behind giving users more control. Strava could easily add check-boxes for “AI data usage” and “Show data publically” to the 3rd party platform API authentication dialog (just like they do today for other features). They could easily require 3rd party developers to ensure consent (just like they do today for other features). And they could easily require developers to adhere to various rules (just like they do today).\n\nGoing Forward:\n\nBased on these API terms changes, I don’t see how any apps can leverage Strava data going forward. Especially with the specific line item of “You may not process or disclose Strava Data, even publicly viewable Strava Data, including in an aggregated or de-identified manner, for the purposes of, including but not limited to, analytics, analyses, customer insights generation, and products or services improvements.” – that’s fundamentally what any app does: It processes your Strava data and provides some sort of analytics.\n\nPerhaps Strava will try and argue otherwise. In fact, I e-mailed them last night asking them to clarify these very questions, since these seemed pretty broad and impactful. The response was nothing more than sending me to the already-existing page about the API updates.\n\nI feel at times that Strava wakes up each morning, heads to work, looks out over the San Francisco Bay from their offices, and asks itself: How can we anger our users and partners today? How can we make everyone’s life more difficult today?\n\nEvery time Strava does something good (such as last week’s night heat maps), they immediately go and ruin that good love with something to upset their user base. And obviously, that’s their prerogative as a company. But it just seems that no company in the sports tech space spends as much time and energy proactively trying to anger their users as Strava does.\n\nI go back to Strava’s new CEO in his keynote address at Camp Strava this past summer (7:22 in video), where he said:\n\n“If you envision the whole active community, along with the connected fitness industry as sorta like one giant cycling peloton…then Strava should be leading the way. We should be your lead-out rider, blocking the wind, creating a slip-stream, helping the whole peloton move faster, and more efficiently.”\n\nI’m unclear on how these changes fit with that recently announced vision.\n\nUltimately, I use and significantly enjoy the core of Strava as much as most other people. I’m on the platform daily. But man…c’mon Strava, just do better.\n\nFOUND THIS POST USEFUL? SUPPORT THE SITE!\n\nHopefully, you found this post useful.
