  "summary_markdown": "# About Strava\n\nStrava, founded on January 1, 2009, is a prominent digital platform that connects athletes worldwide, allowing them to record, share, and analyze their fitness activities. The company is headquartered in San Francisco, California, and has grown to become the world's largest fitness community, with over 125 million athletes across more than 190 countries [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/strava) [(Strava, Press Release, 2023)](https://press.strava.com/articles/strava-unveils-new-chapter-of-accelerated-product-development-at-brands).\n\nStrava primarily operates in the B2C space, offering a range of services and subscription plans to individual users. These services include activity tracking, club creation, sponsored challenges, and event organization. The platform supports various sports, such as running, cycling, and swimming, and integrates with numerous devices and wearables. Strava also offers a Family Plan and a Student Plan to cater to different user needs [(Strava Company Overview)](https://communityhub.strava.com/).\n\nThe company generates revenue through subscription plans and partnerships with brands that sponsor challenges and events on the platform. Strava's partnerships, such as the one with Chipotle, aim to engage users in activities while promoting healthy lifestyles [(Jessica Deyo, Marketing Dive, 2025)](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/chipotle-strava-global-new-years-fitness-goals/736446/).\n\nStrava's distribution is primarily digital, with users accessing the platform via mobile apps and the website. The company has raised a total of $151 million in funding, with the most recent round of $110 million occurring on November 17, 2020 [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/strava).\n\nOver time, Strava has evolved by integrating new technologies, such as AI, to enhance user experience and maintain its competitive edge. The company has also faced challenges, including user dissatisfaction with recent acquisitions and privacy concerns [(Community Hub, Strava, 2024)](https://communityhub.strava.com/general-chat-2/updates-on-fatmap-integration-7742) [(Sylvie Corbet, AP News, 2024)](https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-macron-bodyguards-security-strava-0a48afca09c7aa74d703e72833dcaf72).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nMichael Martin is the CEO of Strava. He has emphasized the company's commitment to enhancing user experience through community feedback and technological advancements. Martin has been vocal about Strava's vision of connecting the world through movement and the company's focus on delivering value to its global user base [(Strava, Press Release, 2023)](https://press.strava.com/articles/strava-unveils-new-chapter-of-accelerated-product-development-at-brands).\n\n# News\n\n## Product Developments and AI Integration\n\nIn 2023, Strava announced a focus on accelerated product development and AI integration at its annual event, Camp Strava. New features include AI-enabled Leaderboard Integrity, a Family Plan subscription, and a Dark Mode for the app [(Strava, Press Release, 2023)](https://press.strava.com/articles/strava-unveils-new-chapter-of-accelerated-product-development-at-brands).\n\n## Partnerships\n\nStrava has partnered with Chipotle to create customized route segments and challenges, expanding their collaboration globally. This partnership aims to engage users in friendly competition while promoting healthy eating habits [(Jessica Deyo, Marketing Dive, 2025)](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/chipotle-strava-global-new-years-fitness-goals/736446/).\n\nIn January 2025, Strava announced a collaboration with Apple Fitness+, integrating their services to motivate and reach more active people. This integration is part of a broader effort to enhance user engagement and expand Strava's reach [(STRAVA, 2025-01-03)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/strava-and-apple-fitness-collaborate-to-motivate-and-reach-more-active-people-in-the-new-year-302336274.html).\n\n## User Feedback and Community Sentiment\n\nStrava's acquisition of Fatmap has led to user frustration due to the lack of integrated features for backcountry skiing and winter sports. Privacy concerns have also been raised following an investigation by Le Monde, which revealed that high-profile individuals' movements could be tracked through the app [(Community Hub, Strava, 2024)](https://communityhub.strava.com/general-chat-2/updates-on-fatmap-integration-7742) [(Sylvie Corbet, AP News, 2024)](https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-macron-bodyguards-security-strava-0a48afca09c7aa74d703e72833dcaf72).\n\nAdditionally, changes to the activity feed have been met with mixed reactions, with some users finding the new layout confusing and less user-friendly [(Community Hub, Strava, 2024)](https://communityhub.strava.com/general-chat-2/activities-missing-in-feed-3859).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nStrava remains a dominant player in the fitness tracking space, with a strong community and innovative features. However, the company faces challenges related to user satisfaction, particularly concerning recent acquisitions and platform changes. Addressing these concerns and enhancing product offerings will be crucial for maintaining its competitive edge and fostering community loyalty.",

Why do you use Strava: for performance metrics? To create routes? Or just for the social aspect?\n\nIf you want all in one, there's no alternative. Strava is king.\n\nFor the social part, Strava is also the best one by far. Seeing your friends or local club workouts, giving kudos, segments and all that stuff. For everything else, you have free alternatives that are arguably better.\n\nFor performance and workout analysis: if you have a Garmin device, you can use Garmin Connect. All other major brands will have their own cloud platform as well, for free (Polar, Suunto etc). If you want to keep things local, there's [GoldenCheetah](https://www.goldencheetah.org/). If you use your phone for tracking, then there's a huge selection of good apps to track your workouts, but I can't comment as I haven't tried many (I'm stuck to Garmin).\n\nTo create routes, there's [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/) (free in your own region) and [Bikemap](https://www.bikemap.net/). Even Google Maps nowadays will do a more-or-less decent job in developed countries. UPDATE: also [Ride with GPS](https://ridewithgps.com/).\n\nFinal option is to keep using Strava and extend it with 3rd party services. For workout analysis, there's [https://intervals.icu](https://intervals.icu) (consider donating!). For automations, calendar export, weather and Spotify data, component tracking and some other extra bits, there's [https://strautomator.com](https://strautomator.com) (disclaimed: I'm the dev). If you want to automate changes to activities using sensor data also from Garmin, there's [https://activityfix.com](https://activityfix.com).

But I think now the segments are. Aside from the exercise measurements and recordings, it is really the only key differing feature (Garmin Connect offers heaps of analytics).\n\nThe genius of Strava is getting people to create segments for them. Crowd sourced data in that way is clever by any company. To replicate that would be difficult, and an automated way would be possibly but difficult (some AI based scripting would be required to make logical segments).\n\nI personally am tending to use my Garmin Connect app more. I use the watch and I find the analytics pretty good. I think Garmin are really the ones to take advantage of Strava dropping the ball. By bettering Strava at its own game, they could perhaps pull people over to their hardware.\n\n### Comment ID jaia53p with +3 score by [(steester, Reddit, 2023-03-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/11eyn9p/ive_seen_a_lot_of_people_like_me_frustrated_at/jaia53p/) (in reply to ID jagvdka):\nI get the fun of segments, my friend is king of many of them.

It incorporates standard fitness tracking features like distance, elevation, and time, but goes further by infusing a light role-playing gaming (RPG) theme, complete with unique character development and elements like points, rewards, and course challenges that motivate users to remain active and achieve their fitness goals.\r  \n\r  \nYou can craft a unique narrative that transforms your running or cycling route into an exciting adventure.\r  \n\r  \nIn addition to these features, our app encourages user participation by allowing them to share their course creations, compete, or support one another through various courses. This fosters a dynamic and interactive fitness community.\r  \n\r  \nBy lightly gamifying fitness, we create a sense of enjoyment and purpose, turning exercise into an activity to look forward to and explore.\r  \n\r  \nOur app is tailored to individuals who are fitness-focused (not gamers) and seeking a more engaging and enjoyable way to track their outdoor activities. By merging social fitness and gaming we hope to create a community of adventure seekers who use our mobile app to explore the great outdoors while reaching their fitness goals.\r  \n\r  \n*/end-of-pitch*\r  \n\r  \nI believe there is a cross-section of us athletes that would enjoy having a little more colour and imagination with our fitness tracking tools.

Yes\n2. Yes but you'll have to manually key in the data for any activity you would want to record. Having a Garmin would log all the data from the watch and send it to Garmin connect.\n\nGarmin offers subscriptions but the basic features you get from owning a Garmin (loads of fitness data and GPS) is more than enough to have you set for recording activities with plenty of data more than Strava.

In this case, it sounds like OP just wants an app and uses their phone to track activity - this is great if it's the right thing for them, but we can't grumble when free things stop being free.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, if you are a regular user of Strava's premium features and value the community element that they provide, £55 a year is not an expensive cost. That's give or take four years worth of a new Garmin Forerunner 255 so it really is all down to what your need and your budget allow.\n\nBut free means people aren't getting paid.\n\n### Comment ID m2jryka with +1 score by [(JohnnyBroccoli, Reddit, 2024-12-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/1hg1egy/best_free_alternative_to_strava/m2jryka/) (in reply to ID m2gnrll):\nStrava is an absolute rip-off.

And even with the Varia - a lot of people don't realize it collects data on passing cars, including GPS coordinates and approaching speeds from the time it first picks up a vehicle until it passes you.\n\nI will say, though, that if you're a Peloton user, workouts will sync directly to Strava - but not Garmin Connect. Fortunately, there's a GREAT service called syncmyworkouts with takes care of all of that, never an issue, for $25/year. I do a Peloton ride, the moment Peloton's servers record it, it syncs with Garmin Connect (and pulls in a LOT of matching, detailed info), and then Garmin Connect uploads to Strava. This happens within 10 seconds of hitting 'stop' on the Peloton Bike or Tread Workouts.

Depending on what activities you do, you might want to look at the features offered.  IIRC, the Forerunner 260 series watches seemed to offer the best price point for what you get.

      "# Post ID 1gwq9eu: Strava API update with +189 score by [(cooeecall, Reddit, 2024-11-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wandrer/comments/1gwq9eu/strava_api_update/)\nHey folks -- got some things cleared up with Strava today, and it's about what we expected. They had two requests:\n\n* Leaderboards should be opt-in by default for new wandrers. Ok, not a big deal.\n\n* Wandrer maps should not be visible to other users. This is what took some back and forth with Strava's legal team because the change to Strava's API terms specifically covers the visibility of \"Strava data\", which is also defined in their terms as data originating from a Strava API endpoint. My pushback on this is that no data that originates from Strava is visible or accessible on your map: it's all drawn from OpenStreetMap geometries, and Strava data definitely informs the boundaries of those geometries, but only after it's gone through Wandrer's algorithms and datasets, and not in a way that identifies time or frequency of travel on a road. I don't think it's fair to call Wandrer's data \"Strava data\", but anyways.\n\nThe only options Strava sees going forward for sharing your map is that the user has something where they could export an image of their map, or maybe generate a one-time link that someone could use to view their map. Neither of those feel like great options to me. My proposal of \"let people decide if they want their map visible to others, with a check-in pop-up every few months for those who have publicly-visible maps\" was not accepted.\n\nI know many of you love sharing your map and looking at other peoples' maps (I do, for sure), so I'm going to provide an option for you to be able to keep doing that going forward: getting your data in to Wandrer through some place other than Strava. If you don't care about other folks being able to see your map, you can just stay where you are.\n\nI'll have a longer blog post with more details as we get those worked out, but I can tell you a few things right now:\n\n* I'm still devoted to working on Wandrer and getting new features and updates out to you (there's new map data available as of last night)\n\n* There will be alternative methods of getting data in to Wandrer if you want. If you have any services that you'd especially like Wandrer to work with, let me know.\n\n* Nothing will change with your data visibility until mid December.\n\n## Comment ID lybao88 with +80 score by [(NorthAway, Reddit, 2024-11-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wandrer/comments/1gwq9eu/strava_api_update/lybao88/) (in reply to ID 1gwq9eu):\nGarmin connect if possible.

It's also a simple as starring the route to get it on my Garmin. The big feature that I like is when I travel and am making a route, routing by \"popular\" typically keeps me on a bike path or bike lane and has also lead me to some pretty epic zones that are \"popular\" for a reason. The heat map also helps when making remote gravel routes just to see if others have ridden a road that I am not totally confident in. \n\nHere's my question. Are there alternative mapping softwares that do similar things to Strava? Keeping me off major highways when I travel and a general heat map for expedition routes are my main priorities. With the whole API fiasco and someone who works in tech I'd like to find an alternative. It's the route building that has kept me on premium. \n\nEdit: thanks everyone.

I created a \"road cycling\" course to the top of the peak I've been to before. I know that the flat bit is around 30k and the uphill bit is around 30k. Garmin showed me a route that was 48k and I was shocked I've done 12 additional kilometres before taking the main road on the flat bit. On the uphill there's only one road so it can't be where the difference comes from. So I set off and on the way up I didn't even notice where I went wrong on the only road. So I went \"off the course\" and I was really curious where I was supposed to go.\n\nTldr there's a downhill trail that Garmin course planner wanted me to take uphill on my ROAD CYCLING route... So thanks Garmin. I'm never using it again.\n\n## Comment ID lyjyj93 with +1 score by [(AKHILKTM, Reddit, 2024-11-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/1gxlt0a/alternatives_for_route_planning/lyjyj93/) (in reply to ID 1gxlt0a):\ntry Komoot.It's free and support trun-by-turn navigation and Google Streetview\n\n## Comment ID lyk3tbo with +1 score by [(cdamian, Reddit, 2024-11-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/1gxlt0a/alternatives_for_route_planning/lyk3tbo/) (in reply to ID 1gxlt0a):\nIf you want something really nerdy try bikerouter\n\nhttps://bikerouter.de/?lng=en#map=14/50.6856/7.1748/CyclOSM\n\n## Comment ID lykfos3 with +1 score by [(Andybanshee, Reddit, 2024-11-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/1gxlt0a/alternatives_for_route_planning/lykfos3/) (in reply to ID 1gxlt0a):\nHere is another option.

The more mundane stuff (some dog walks, commutes, etc.) I don't set as public, but most workouts/runs/rides/xc skiing/etc. gets shared publicly. I see plenty of workouts from other folks in my feed.

You can do this when editing the activity in the app. \n\nOr just make it private.\n\n## Comment ID j20t8wi with +2 score by [(GrisseBasseDK, Reddit, 2022-12-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/zxddlv/posting_gym_workouts_on_strava_a_big_no_no/j20t8wi/) (in reply to ID zxddlv):\nI tried but it takes to much time for me to put in all the weights and reps.

I used to just keep them private but if some one cares enough to look at my profile they probably care enough to see my more interesting rides in the context of my commutes. but yeah i guess what im saying is i dont like feed spam but its cool to be able to see the \"behind the scenes\" of people who do epic rides/runs, so thats what i try to do with my stuff.   \n\n\nbut also imo strava is more about the social side of fitness so sharing everything is valid because its not that dissimilar from the irl act of telling mates about your progress. its good and lets them share in some way of your success and be there for you when you are struggling.\n\n## Comment ID j1zsa6j with +2 score by [(ippon1, Reddit, 2022-12-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/zxddlv/posting_gym_workouts_on_strava_a_big_no_no/j1zsa6j/) (in reply to ID zxddlv):\nJust hide your Gym workouts.\n\n## Comment ID j204qpg with +1 score by [(keepmoving1202, Reddit, 2022-12-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/zxddlv/posting_gym_workouts_on_strava_a_big_no_no/j204qpg/) (in reply to ID zxddlv):\nI post my strength workouts with exercise name, reps and time.

It’s just pointless to know the average Hr for the duration of the workout. There’s no provision to record and see what specific workouts you did, how much weight and how many reps.

On the watch app the 'end' workout button is massive & it's very easy to accidentally touch it which is super annoying. Thank you.",

This should be automatically flagged, instead strava expect to users to flag other people's activities and limits flagging to only 10 activities a day.

For example, the “Fitness and Freshness” is only available on the website. Seems like that can be developed into an app-friendly format. \n\nAlso, it would be nice to have equipment options for all sports. For example, having the option for different surfboards/skis/snowboards to choose from. Plenty of people have multiple sets of equipment for all of these sports.\n\nDoes Strava actually read reviews to see what the customers actually want or don’t want?",

I feel compelled to write this review as it’s very frustrating to be asked to UPGRADE on almost every screen in the app, seeing it over and over.\n\nI’ve always liked Strava over the years and the gradual updates it’s made over time, and used the paid subscription for enhanced features while training more seriously for a short period.\n\nIf the app is no longer sustainable for the amount of free vs paid subscribers then just charge for the app already and quit being so aggressive demanding users upgrade. I noticed most of my old friends/followers hardly seem to use the app now, removing part of the fun when I was more active before. I might be forced to find another app and leave Strava behind too.",

I’m sure this is just a tactic to try and make people more engaged with their. Absolute garbage in my opinion. I can’t wait to get a bike computer and get off this.",

I've never seen so many people go out on disability for burnout before. Everything looks shiny and supportive, but at the end of the day, they don't care, don't give you proper direction and then toss you when you don't meet expectations that were never really described.

We miss the mark here and there but we always make sure to make up for it and then some. I feel seen, heard, and valued overall. Could they do more to employ more diverse employees? Absolutely!

I think this is the largest pain point for the company, along with needs for leadership refinement/development. While leadership is made up of nice people, they don't have the skills necessary to effectively lead the organization and get it out of this rut it's been in. There is a strong community of individuals with similar interests in fitness/sports at the company, but I feel like this can lead to an echo chamber effect sometimes. Over the course of my time there, it was disappointing to see several features fail to take off, and I believe the company would benefit from more reflection and analysis on what went wrong and how to improve moving forward. The multiple reorgs last year has led to a great deal of confusion among the employees - ways of working and processes are always changing. It also appears the company relies on verbal recognition as the primary form of award and not additional comp/bonuses when it comes to recognizing employees who go above and beyond.",

This is truly an organization that practices what it preaches in terms of diversity, work-life balance, and pay equality. I remember being so impressed in a company all-hands one day when the HR team announced a new initiative to examine gender pay equality within the company. This speaks volumes about the company, management, and the board to be dedicating resources to such a worthy issue. And this is just one of countless examples of Strava working to do the right thing. For me at a personal level, I always felt that my managers and colleagues were invested in my growth and development. While I did end up leaving Strava to pursue an education, there was always an open dialogue about where I wanted to go career-wise and folks did all they could to support that while I was there. We even had (free!) access to a full time career coach who was very influential in my choosing to move into development.",

We were most recently thrilled to add a new Chief Product and Experience Officer to the team, Meghan Laffey. We feel our leadership team is more solid than ever, and the company culture has never been stronger. \n\nWe wish you all the best in your next career move, and if you ever want to share more about your experience at Strava please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly at michele@strava.com.",

We also have a great track record of promoting people from within. I'm sorry that wasn't your impression, and I'd welcome the chance to hear about your specific experience if you'd like to reach out.

The engineering team has been investing a lot of effort over the last year to become more nimble and is moving to much faster releases, which makes us more nimble.\r\n\r\nPerks wise, it's tough to beat. Many of them are oriented around an athletic life style. On site yoga, pro deals with most gear manufacturers, stipends for new equipment and races, and fantastic health insurance, to name a few. Plenty of time off to make sure you can decompress or train. A few provided meals a week and otherwise plenty of snacks. We don't have three meals a day like many tech companies, but it's not a major downer, the local food is good and we all still eat lunch together away from our desks.",

Despite such shoddy decisions they are still tasked with running the show. Their is no accountability. - The senior leadership culture is very defensive. They push a culture where nobody can express a critique about anything. The smallest negative opinion or feedback is punished, and the all hands is used to publically shame the entire company to ensure even anonymously nobody says anything negative about leadership. The anonymous forum is a joke - all the responses are platitudes and gas-lighting of employees, with the aim to ensure nobody submits any further feedback. They keep saying come have a live conversation but when people go have a live conversation they punish them and take away their good projects. - The leadership team has their head in the sand about the business. They only listen to someone with no experience, who is pushing his personal agenda but knows how to butter up the senior leaders. - The company made a huge deal about being anti-racist. By all reports, the people of color are unhappy and leaving in bulk.",

What companies still do this???\n\nStrava colleagues help to maintain a low stress environment, even when dealing with tight deadlines. The amount of mutual respect afforded to one another is remarkable. \n\nIf you live near one of the current office locations, there are weekly work out sessions, and the leadership team often joins!\n\nStrava has incredible benefits! Compensation aside (which is very competitive), Strava has very generous benefit plans, and in addition, offers annual gear stipends to all employees. Working for a Company at the center of connected fitness, it makes sense to have the best gear to document those journeys! One of the employee perks that cannot be overstated are the industry discounts. Just wow! \n\nThis is truly a great place to be!",

And deeply upsetting to the fairly diverse workforce they've built while adhering to those standards (awkwarddddddd).\n\nEven their idea of what Strava is and who it's for seems to change on the reg. I can't actually tell what we're for and what we're against, except that we seem to be for making money and against other people making more money. When you lack a \"why\", you go public all you want, but it's going to be absolutely brutal shortly thereafter.\n\nGood luck with career advancement, too.

This is truly an organization that practices what it preaches in terms of diversity, work-life balance, and pay equality. I remember being so impressed in a company all-hands one day when the HR team announced a new initiative to examine gender pay equality within the company. This speaks volumes about the company, management, and the board to be dedicating resources to such a worthy issue. And this is just one of countless examples of Strava working to do the right thing. For me at a personal level, I always felt that my managers and colleagues were invested in my growth and development. While I did end up leaving Strava to pursue an education, there was always an open dialogue about where I wanted to go career-wise and folks did all they could to support that while I was there.

One of the employee perks that cannot be overstated are the industry discounts. Just wow! \n\nThis is truly a great place to be!",

They push a culture where nobody can express a critique about anything.

The anonymous forum is a joke - all the responses are platitudes and gas-lighting of employees, with the aim to ensure nobody submits any further feedback. They keep saying come have a live conversation but when people go have a live conversation they punish them and take away their good projects. - The leadership team has their head in the sand about the business.

There is a strong community of individuals with similar interests in fitness/sports at the company, but I feel like this can lead to an echo chamber effect sometimes. Over the course of my time there, it was disappointing to see several features fail to take off, and I believe the company would benefit from more reflection and analysis on what went wrong and how to improve moving forward. The multiple reorgs last year has led to a great deal of confusion among the employees - ways of working and processes are always changing.

Howard Calvert decided to find out...\n\nYou’ve no doubt seen some Strava art, if not on your own Strava feed, in our Strava Stories section, or even in the news.\n\nIf you haven’t, Strava art is the term given to an activity on Strava that creates a piece of art using the GPS map of the activity.\n\nSometimes it may happen inadvertently, for example when someone comments that your 10K run route looks “a bit like an arrow”, but usually it’s a finely tuned and intricately planned masterpiece, sometimes months in the making.\n\nRELATED: 13 Pieces of Strava Art That Made Us... Wow\n\nOver the past few years, these Strava art designs have become so impressive they deserve to be framed and displayed in a gallery. Recent jaw-dropping examples include Nicolas Georgiou’s koi carp in London, Lenny Maughan's Road Runner and BigBird DPS Art’s mind-bending Impossible (Penrose) Triangle.\n\nSo I decided to take up the challenge of creating my own Strava art. How hard could it be?\n\nStrava Art: The Hard Miles\n\nAs it turns out, it’s exceedingly difficult and I tip my cap to the athletes out there creating artwork that simply astounds in its design. How do they do it?\n\nI asked Nico Georgiou for his advice on how he creates work like his koi carp, Mark Cavendish for the TdF, and his seriously impressive, 237 mile / 383km-long ‘Something for the Olympics’. Based in London, his day job is as a designer, something he says helps inform his Strava artwork.\n\n“With any Strava art design, I start by looking at a map,” he says. “Then I just go for it. I throw my first navigation point down, second point, third point, and then I expand lines and move them around on the map.\n\nRELATED: Love Strava Art? How to Create Your Own Masterpiece\n\n“For me, the drawing itself isn’t the problem — it’s trying to find the infrastructure in the roads and how to navigate things like rivers and train tracks.”\n\nIf Nico’s design needs to cross a river — and he regularly crosses the Thames in his art — he pauses the recording, rides to the nearest bridge, crosses, and then rides to where the drawing will continue before unpausing, meaning Strava’s GPS will draw a straight line across the river to that point. This results in him cycling farther than the distance shown on the final artwork — sometimes up to 70km more.\n\nOther big challenges are one-way systems, getting over footbridges, London parks closing at night, even unexpected police cordons or roads closed due to roadworks.\n\n“There’s a lot of problem-solving,” he says. “The first problem is the planning and drawing stage.” This usually takes him five or six hours of initial drawing which are then intricately refined over the course of a month. “I start with a point A and point B, and fill in the space between. For the koi carp, there were 666 navigation points.”\n\nThe next problem is the actual drawing of it on his bike. “Study the map and work out exactly what you need to make it work when riding it,” he advises. “If there’s a one-way street, for example, I know I’ll have to hop off my bike and walk along the sidewalk, or put my bike over my shoulder and cross a footbridge.”\n\nRELATED: Around the World in Strava Art\n\nHe also warns that having fully-charged batteries is of paramount importance, for both your GPS systems and your bike lights. The koi carp took him around 20 hours in total, starting at 3.30 am. “I navigate via my phone, and record the ride on my Garmin.”\n\nBut, for Nico, it’s this combined challenge of designing the artwork and then completing it, that draws him back in time and time again. “That and the headspace it provides,” he says, “even though my wife thinks I’m mad!”\n\nFor me, the drawing itself isn’t the problem — it’s trying to find the infrastructure in the roads and how to navigate things like rivers and train tracks.\n\nStrava Art: Expert Advice\n\nNico’s tips for beginners wanting to have a go at their own Strava art include:\n\nStick to freeform ideas. Try not to do anything too regimented.\n\nAvoid circles. You need to go a huge distance to create a decent circle.\n\n“Planning is an important part of creating a successful piece of art,” says Nico. “If you’re on a bike, do it in a town with plenty of roads to make it work. If you’re running, my suggestion is to use a large empty field and prep the route with markers as reference points.”\n\nUse a route-building website, such as Strava’s route planner.\n\nStart drawing! As Nico says, begin with two navigation points and take it from there. Be as creative as you like, or keep it simple, with something like a heart or a star if you want to build confidence.\n\nSave and export your ride to your device, whether it’s a watch or bike computer.\n\nStart riding or running, following the route you designed.\n\nTry not to take any wrong turns, as that could ruin the end product.\n\nEnjoy your activity, soak up the new sights. At the end, it’s the moment of truth — view the final art in Strava, and publish it on your feed.\n\nArt Attack\n\nWith that advice in mind, I head out on my own art-based expedition. I know I want to keep it local, and to start with run rather than cycle. But what to design? I experiment with something basic — a heart on a large, open field — but quickly give up when I figure it will inevitably end up resembling a large blob.\n\nThen, it hits me: what would be more appropriate than the kudos sign? A thumbs up for all Strava users. I scan my local area for anything that might string together to form the symbol… eventually, I draw what I think is a good enough thumbs up using the Strava route planner.\n\nGET PLANNING: Strava Routes and Heatmap: Find New Places to Go\n\nBut while I’m there I get a little more ambitious. These grids of new housing could easily form eyes… with a nose, mouth, whiskers… it’s a cat! But I can’t get the ears to work due to a canal and roads inaccessible due to military use. Maybe it looks more like the Grinch? When I attempt to run it, I suddenly change my mind and realize it could be Mario, so I have to adjust parts of it on the fly, keeping Nico’s advice to “not do anything too regimented” at the forefront of my mind.",
      "# [Strava Unveils New Chapter of Accelerated Product Development at Brand's Flagship Event on 2024-05-16](https://press.strava.com/articles/strava-unveils-new-chapter-of-accelerated-product-development-at-brands)\nThe Company introduces increased product velocity, leveraging advancements in Artificial Intelligence, in service of its vision of a world connected through movement.\n\nLOS ANGELES (May 16, 2023) — Strava, the leading digital community for active people with more than 125 million athletes, today showcased its latest initiatives and product developments at its annual event, Camp Strava. With the theme of Progress, Together company leaders announced how the platform will empower its global community to make progress in the way they explore, move, and connect on Strava.\n\n“Strava is gaining momentum to realize our vision of a world connected through movement,” said Michael Martin, chief executive officer of Strava. “We are focused on two fundamental shifts to accelerate how we deliver value to 125 million people globally– building for women and leveraging Artificial Intelligence – which will unlock new community-and-partner-powered experiences across the platform.”\n\nA New Era of Product Velocity\n\nStrava, with new leaders at the helm, is ushering in its next era of product velocity. The company listened closely to feedback from its global community and announced three of the most requested features coming to the platform by the end of the year.\n\nThe first of these updates, AI-enabled Leaderboard Integrity, will harness machine learning to automatically flag irregular, improbable, or impossible activities recorded to the platform. Trained by millions of activities, this feature allows all users on Strava to play fair and have more fun.\n\nAdditionally, the company announced a new Family Plan Subscription, the sister of the company’s Student Plan. With Family Plan, it’s easier to make a fitness commitment with your community by sharing an annual subscription with up to three other people – friends, family, or fitness family. Launching in select countries this summer, with plans to roll out globally by the end of the year, Strava’s newest annual subscription option offers the best value for groups (up to four), with a discount off the regular subscription price for each member.\n\nStrava also implemented an updated design system, an initiative that is integral in driving a heightened pace of product innovation at the company. Through this work, Strava announced the launch of one of the company’s most requested features, Dark mode. Dark mode will improve the in-app experience for all users, reducing eye strain and improving accessibility while they record activity or scroll through the feed. Athletes can expect a rollout later this summer with options to keep their mobile settings always dark, always light, or match their device settings.\n\nCompany leaders highlighted several other features and updates to current products like Flyover, with its next iteration offering an overlay with activity stats and off-platform sharing capabilities. The overlay is available today for Strava subscribers and an off-platform sharing option will be released later this year.\n\nBuild for Her, Build for Many\n\nStudies show that women of all ages participate in sports at a far lower rate than men, and overall, despite wanting to be active, find less time to dedicate to an active lifestyle. As the company continues on its mission to motivate people to live their best active lives, building for women on the platform will ultimately serve everyone in the Strava community. Several new features and initiatives were announced as a part of this strategic focus, which includes:\n\nNight Heatmaps: Night Heatmaps show only activities between sundown and sunrise – so athletes can get an idea of which roads, trails, and paths are well-trafficked after hours. Since Night Heatmaps filter for after-hours routes, it can be a helpful tool for female athletes training before sunrise and after sunset.\n\nQuick Edit: For active women, having control over what is shared with the Strava community that cheers them on - like what time a run is logged - is important. Quick Edit makes it easier to make the most common edits - like activity name, and privacy settings so you can hide your start time, your map, or other workout stats.\n\nStrive for More®: The company announced a new phase of its Strive for More® initiative, created in 2022 to promote and support women in movement and sport. Today, Strava unveiled an official partnership with media company TOGETHXR to encourage more women to watch - and play - women’s sports. As part of the partnership, Strava will also donate $100,000 to the Alex Morgan Foundation, started by co-founder of TOGETHXR, Alex Morgan, to support their mission to help girls and women find confident paths forward in sports and life.\n\nAthlete Intelligence\n\nToday, Strava announced the start of an accelerated product roadmap, outlining how Strava will implement the latest technological enhancements in AI and machine learning, to transform the athlete experience.\n\nOne key advancement to the platform includes the company’s latest development, Athlete Intelligence. Strava is introducing its beta AI-powered feature which turns each subscriber’s training data into an easily digestible summary that contextualizes their accomplishments and fitness goals. Unlike other AI-powered training services, Strava connects with thousands of devices, wearables, and fitness apps, so an athlete’s insights can consider their entire fitness story across multiple sports and modalities.\n\nThe features shared at Camp Strava will be released on a rolling basis through the end of the year. To view the full list of product releases and further details, visit www.press.strava.com.\n\nFor more information on Strava, to create a free account, or to start a free subscription trial visit www.strava.com.\n\nAbout Strava\n\nStrava is the leading digital community for active people with more than 125 million athletes, in more than 190 countries. The platform offers a holistic view of your active lifestyle, no matter where you live, which sport you love and/or what device you use. Everyone belongs on Strava when they are pursuing an active life.

      "# [Updates on FATMAP integration?](https://communityhub.strava.com/general-chat-2/updates-on-fatmap-integration-7742)\nPage 1 / 1\n\nIs anyone else missing the functionality of Fatmap this winter? I’m back to using Google Earth for an oblique view of mountain terrain, but I really loved the the elevation and avalanche overlays in Fatmap. Can some of the original Fatmap features be incorporated into the Strava map?\n\nHi- I’m so confused - I can’t see ANY trace of Fatmap on the Strava app. How are you seeing all the winter slopes etc? Thanks for your help!!, L\n\nHi @LINIC\n\nNone of Fatmap's features have been migrated to Strava yet. I think someone from the staff should give us an update on when we can expect any news because, as of now, there’s absolutely no trace of Fatmap on Strava.\n\nHa! Strava have marked this conversation as ‘solved’. WTF\n\nOk cheers.\n\nBusiness as usual for a 1.5 Billion dollar company then.\n\nWhat a joke!\n\nHi L,\n\nI’ve already canceled my subscription. I recommend checking out apps like Caltopo or Outmap. Outmap (iOS/Android) has features like slope angle, slope aspect, avalanche risk, flat areas, and excellent 3D maps. I think it’s the closest alternative to Fatmap we currently have for winter sports.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nCheers!\n\nHi ​@npinchak\n\nafter the takeover of FATMAP, STRAVA shut down FATMAP and wants to gradually integrate the features of FATMAP into SRAVA. Obviously not everything has been transferred yet.\n\nMaybe this information will help?\n\nhttps://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/26949702911117-What-to-Expect-as-FATMAP-Transitions-to-Strava\n\nhttps://press.strava.com/articles/fatmap-is-transitioning-to-strava\n\nThanks ​@cy-linder, that’s good to know. Still, I wonder when more features will be added. It’s been over a year since we’ve known Fatmap would be taken down. The 3D imagery on the desktop map is pretty good, but it’s harder to navigate without arrow keys. And missing the awesome Fatmap overlays... Just hope they will bring these features back.\n\n@strava @scout any news? Really?\n\nWinter is here again but sadly this year when I went to open my favourite winter app I see it’s gone, and for some reason I’m sent to my sometimes useful summer app.\n\nbut sadly none of the features I relied on are here, no backcountry routes no resort trails nothing I relied on each winter (sometimes to get myself out of some trickery situations).\n\nI would have thought with such an acquisition they’d get at least the minimum features across but no but I guess it wasn’t planned so well..\n\nI guess we all will question the reason for the acquisition, could it be the users? I doubt it, I’m positive all 1.5M FATMAP users already have Strava installed. The tech? More likely, but they seem to have failed on that one. This year like me those who didn’t have a Strava subscription will be forced to try the free month, where like me they’ll remember that Strava is not a backcountry app and like me they’ll cancel before the trail ends. Next season will we be back? I doubt it. Good opportunity for the competition to FATMAP to up their game and take on a share of those users I guess. For me now it’s back to good old GPS topo maps for my planning, good skills never die even when a great app makes them redundant (for a time).\n\nAnyway alas FATMAP I’ll miss you, a great app with a great name. You’ll be remembered.\n\nBring back fatmap! Why would you deprecate and shut down the app before integrating the features into Strava? The company is hurting its backcountry users.\n\nI also miss FATMAP so much and feel completely disappointed with this acquisition, as it seems that a great backcountry app has been killed.\n\nI know that integrations take some time, but is this going to happen at any time? If not, byebye Strava and thanks for nothing.\n\nI subscribed to Strava only for Fatmap’s features so if there won’t be Fatmap functionality or at least clear time schedule I won’t renew Strava subscription. I don’t need yet another Facebook.\n\nMap layers need to be added for slope angle/avalanche, aspect, distance, flats, gradient, snow depth, snow accumulation. These are crucial for backcountry travel (specifically skiing) and were available in fatmap and should be migrated over into strava since fatmap was shut down.\n\nMigrate fatmap public ski routes to strava - backcountry, alpine skiing, more. These routes were a wonderful knowledgebase of routes, beta, and more for all over the world. It would be amazing to have them available in strava now that fatmap is shut down.\n\nI subscribed to Strava only for Fatmap’s features so if there won’t be Fatmap functionality or at least clear time schedule I won’t renew Strava subscription. I don’t need yet another Facebook.\n\nNo wonder you don’t want to renew your subscription. Strava hasn’t kept its word. There isn’t a single FatMap feature integrated, and they don’t engage with the community. It’s disappointing.\n\nI subscribed to Strava only for Fatmap’s features so if there won’t be Fatmap functionality or at least clear time schedule I won’t renew Strava subscription.

Strava is in fact solely for running, swimming and biking. Any other sport is just an appendix to them.\n\nBRING BACK FATMAP. Tfe functionality and information detail of the Strava maps are severely lacking.\n\nHello and thanks to everyone who has posted here. We appreciate your enthusiasm for these features.\n\nWe are in the process of integrating FATMAP's 3D map - including winter satellite maps and terrain tools - into the map screens within the Strava app and website. FATMAP's 3D map is already visible in Strava's Flyover feature, and now includes the ability to pause and modify flight speed. You can also see FATMAP's 3D map images in the Strava feed.\n\nIn addition, FATMAP route content, excluding user-generated content, will be moved to Strava. We are currently working on the new home for these routes so they can be used seamlessly within the Strava app.\n\nCertain FATMAP features will not be available in Strava in time for the Northern Hemisphere winter including waypoints, personal guidebooks, national Topo maps (including IGN and OS maps), offline map downloads of the FATMAP map and live snow and piste information. We are exploring adding these and similar features to Strava in the future.\n\nHello and thanks to everyone who has posted here.

We need a planning tool, not a social tool to see what we have done.\n\nCertain FATMAP features will not be available in Strava in time for the Northern Hemisphere winter: At the very least, it is reckless to have removed a safety tool for the community in the middle of winter without having a minimum alternative.\n\nI’m sorry to be so harsh, but it’s unfortunate how this has been handled by Strava. For the record, I was previously a subscriber of both Strava and FatMap. I didn’t mind paying for two applications. Now, I have canceled my Strava subscription and subscribed to GaiaGPS.\n\nI just discovered today that, after acquiring fatmaps, Strava went ahead and essentially deleted it. The ENTIRE PURPOSE of fatmaps was to provide, literal, life-saving information for navigating backcountry terrain in the winter, where slope gradient IS AN ENTIRELY CRITICAL element of safe travel. Not only do strava maps and route making capabilities LACK THE GRADIENT OVERLAY, they don’t even allow you to make off-piste routes - you can only draw on existing, “known” trails. The claim of acquiring fatmaps “to make outdoor travel more accessible” is absolute bull until these features are reinstated.\n\nSTRAVA: I implore you to hire someone who participates in backcountry winter sports - skiing, boarding, snowmobiling, whatever - who understands JUST HOW CRITICAL IT IS TO BE ABLE TO SEE SLOPE GRADIENT WHEN PLANNING A BACKCOUNTRY ROUTE who will reinstate this feature or just bring the fatmaps app back. Otherwise it seems inevitable that I will be foregoing my strava subscription for something like OnX backcountry.\n\nHello and thanks to everyone who has posted here.

I think prioritizing offline map area downloads (including routes) should be important. Most backcountry zones I enter have no cell service...so I NEED to be able to have offline maps for safe travel in the backcountry (avoiding avalanche terrain, seeing different routes, etc). Piste info would also be nice to have, as when skiing at a new ski resort can be confusing and this can help with navigation (but not nearly as important as offline maps, and all of the map layers that fatmap had like aspect, slope angle, etc).\n\nAlso - fatmap should not have been shut down until these were released.",
      "# [Fitness app Strava gives away location of Biden, Trump and other leaders, French newspaper says by Sylvie Corbet, breaking news. twitter, apnews.com, sylvie-corbet on 2024-10-28](https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-macron-bodyguards-security-strava-0a48afca09c7aa74d703e72833dcaf72)\nPARIS (AP) — An investigation by French newspaper Le Monde found that the highly confidential movements of U.S. President Joe Biden, presidential rivals Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, and other world leaders can be easily tracked online through a fitness app that their bodyguards use.\n\nBut the U.S. Secret Service told the newspaper that it doesn’t believe the protection it provides was in any way compromised.\n\nLe Monde found that some U.S. Secret Service agents use the Strava fitness app, including in recent weeks after two assassination attempts on Trump, in a video investigation released in French and in English. Strava is a fitness tracking app primarily used by runners and cyclists to record their activities and share their workouts with a community.\n\nLe Monde also found Strava users among the security staff for French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin. In one example, Le Monde traced the Strava movements of Macron’s bodyguards to determine that the French leader spent a weekend in the Normandy seaside resort of Honfleur in 2021. The trip was meant to be private and wasn’t listed on the president’s official agenda.\n\nLe Monde said the whereabouts of Melania Trump and Jill Biden could also be pinpointed by tracking their bodyguards’ Strava profiles.\n\nIn a statement to Le Monde, the U.S. Secret Service said its staff aren’t allowed to use personal electronic devices while on duty during protective assignments but “we do not prohibit an employee’s personal use of social media off-duty.”\n\n“Affected personnel has been notified,” it said. “We will review this information to determine if any additional training or guidance is required.”\n\n“We do not assess that there were any impacts to protective operations or threats to any protectees,” it added. Locations “are regularly disclosed as part of public schedule releases.”\n\nIn another example, Le Monde reported that a U.S. Secret Service agent’s Strava profile revealed the location of a hotel where Biden subsequently stayed in San Francisco for high-stakes talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2023. A few hours before Biden’s arrival, the agent went jogging from the hotel, using Strava which traced his route, the newspaper found.\n\nThe newspaper’s journalists say they identified 26 U.S. agents, 12 members of the French GSPR, the Security Group of the Presidency of the Republic, and six members of the Russian FSO, or Federal Protection Service, all of them in charge of presidential security, who had public accounts on Strava and were therefore communicating their movements online, including during professional trips. Le Monde did not identify the bodyguards by name for security reasons.\n\nIt said movements trackable on Strava could lead to security breaches, especially when security agents travel in advance to places like hotels where leaders then stay and hold meetings.\n\nMacron’s office said Monday that the consequences of the issues reported by Le Monde “are very slight and in no way affect the security of the President of the Republic.”\n\nLocal authorities are aware of Macron’s movements ahead of time and the places where Macron is staying are always fully secure, “so the risk is non-existent,” the statement said.\n\n“A reminder was nevertheless issued to agents by the chief of staff asking them not to use this app,” Macron’s office added.\n\nThe Harris campaign deferred comment on the security issue to federal officials. In response to questions posed to the Trump campaign, a spokesperson for the Republican National Committee repeated some of its criticisms of the Biden administration but did not address the vulnerability or how the campaign has responded.\n\nThe security risks associated with fitness apps show the need for better regulations on how tech companies can use consumer data, according to Ibrahim Baggili, a computer scientist and professor of cybersecurity at Louisiana State University.\n\nBaggili’s research has exposed how bad actors could use fitness app data to track potential victims — creating risks for stalking, robbery and other crimes.\n\nConsumers often grant app developers the right to use or sell their data when they agree to the terms of service, Baggili said.\n\n“Companies love our data, and we love the product, so we give away the data for free,” he said. “The government really needs to start cracking down on how data can be used and how long it can be retained.”\n\nIdentifying the presidential bodyguards — some of them using their full name on Strava — could also help in finding other details about their personal addresses, their families, their movements, and photos they posted on various social media, all of which could possibly be used to put pressure on them for malicious purposes, the report stressed.\n\n___\n\nAP reporter David Klepper contributed from Washington.",
      "# [Activities missing in feed](https://communityhub.strava.com/general-chat-2/activities-missing-in-feed-3859)\nPage 1 / 1\n\nYesterday me feed order (which is set at chronological) suddenly changed putting activities (that I had already seen and given kudos) from the beginning of this month at the top and hiding most recent activities in the middle of the month. This has also happened to a friends. No amount of changing the feed order does anything to rectify this. Why has it happened?\n\nSame, on app and website, feed is just random... it's showing runs I did last month and nothing recent except latest\n\nIt looks like Strava made a change which switched the default ordering from latest activities to personalized, I've seen this reported in a few other places. You can change the preference from https://www.strava.com/settings/display under \"Feed Ordering\" or in the app under You > Gear Icon (top right) > Feed Ordering. See https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001183630-Feed-Ordering\n\nUnfortunately per Strava, the change will only impact new activities so it won't fix the issue right away.\n\nAny changes will apply only to new activities in your feed, so you may not notice a difference at first\n\nI might be an outlier, but I use Strava primarily to view my own activities. It seems that recently the activity feed filter on the website has changed, and it now only shows athletes I'm following by default. I have to select \"My Activities\" to see my own activities and, whenever I return to the activity feed page, it shows the athletes I'm following again.\n\nIn the past I could simply see ALL activities, mine and those I follow. Why has this option been deleted? I liked that.\n\nIt seems Strava is really emphasizing activities of other athletes over my own. I found the same to be true in the Android App. After I open it I have to press two buttons to view my own activities and none to view those of others. I only use the app for it's beacon feature, so I don't know if this was different in the past, nor do I really care. It is strange though.\n\nYes, Strava thinks of itself as a social platform, and I don't mind that, but having to dig around for the thing I'm really interested in seems strange. What's up with that?\n\nIf you scroll down a long way, do your own activities appear somewhen in the \"I'm following\" sections? Strava made some buggy changes to the activity sortings for users which used the chronological sorting of the feed. There is another thread with a similar problem: https://communityhub.strava.com/t5/campfire-chat/activities-missing-in-feed/td-p/41907\n\n@Jan_MantauYes, even though the feed is set to \"Following\", when I scroll back to before 1st of September I do see my own activities in the feed. I guess I'm not following myself anymore since the beginning of the month. 🙄\n\nExtra info: My \"Display Preferences\" > \"Feed Ordering\" is set as \"Latest Activities\", since the description of \"Personalized\" sounds awful.\n\nDid you need to change it to personalized or has it always been set to chronological?\n\nI'm asking because if you changed it, it only affects new activities so you won't see the change right away. It will display correctly from now on though.\n\nI did try several things so, yes, I might have changed it.\n\nI just did a very strenuous desk exercise of 11 seconds, uploaded it, and indeed it does now appear again in the \"Following\" feed.\n\nThis seems to solve the issue. I guess the \"Personalized\" feed is new and Strava pushes people to it? I now see that more people aren't happy with that.\n\nHi @Ajwaller,\n\nTo add some additional context to what @ActivityFix noted; we recently made a change in our model that surfaces older activities a user may have missed amongst newer activities. If you'd like to view your feed in chronological order please ensure your Feed Ordering setting is set to \"Latest Activities.\" If it's already set to \"Latest Activities,\" you can perform a reset by selecting \"Personalized\" and then switching back to \"Latest Activities.\"\n\nAfter changing the setting, the feed will not update immediately. Only activities uploaded after the setting change will follow the rules of the new setting.\n\nAdditionally, there may be some cases where an older activity appears at the top of the feed when an athlete you’re following makes an older activity publicly visible. We do this to make sure you see every activity from athletes you follow as soon as possible.\n\nFor additional information, see our help center article here: How the Strava feed works\n\nThis is a lesson to devs. Don’t fix what is not broken. Suddenly all my recent runs from my own feed disappeared as did all the people I follow. Changing settings did not fix….maybe moving forward but why mess with what works and what people use the platform for. If there is no reliable feed there is no Strava\n\nthere must be some issue with your model. i see completely different activities after every reload\n\nSo I did a ride two days ago and it uploaded automatically on completion through my phone. When I opened Strava (web) to admire my achievement it was nowhere to be seen. Eventually found it at about 200th in the feed, buried under entries from October and November in apparently random date order. I had never changed the ordering setting.\n\nI have tried changing the ordering setting backwards and forward several times, but it refuses to put my ride in the correct sequence - if anything it seems to make it worse.\n\nit drives me nuts when something that worked perfectly for years suddenly gets broken by an upgrade.\n\nStrava gods please fix it, even if it needs a one time button to set my entire history to chronological order! Randomization shouldn’t be an option, but now it seems to be the default.",
      "# [Strava API Agreement Update by mcneese.chad on 2024-11-18](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/strava-api-agreement-update/98191)\nYou might’ve seen this from Strava in your email just now:\n\nㅤ\n\nWe’re reaching out to inform you of a change that affects how third-party apps connected to Strava may display certain information. This update, effective on November 11th, is part of our commitment to privacy and transparency across all connected apps and devices.\n\nㅤ\n\n…which includes this condition:\n\nData Use Limitations:\n\nWe’re updating our terms to explicitly prohibit third parties from using any data obtained via Strava’s API in artificial intelligence models or other similar applications.\n\nㅤ\n\nWhich platforms is that going to effect?\n\nReading between the lines … strava saying “it’s OUR data and we need to protect our most valuable asset”.\n\nThe only third party I share strava with is intervals.icu. But IMO would make sense to start sharing the primary source of data (garmin, wahoo, etc) with third parties rather than strava, even though strava is usually the easiest.\n\nI do this stuff for a living and hope this isn’t the start of a larger trend. Like I’m not going to be happy if Garmin pulls something like this. Unfortunately pervasive in my industry though (healthcare).\n\nIf that is indeed true I suppose I can always do:\n\nWahoo → TR and Zwift → TR (if that is indeed coming soon) for my indoor, unstructured rides.\n\nI understand why Strava is doing this but I feel like this could be the user’s choice on a third party integration basis.\n\nIt sure sounds like it, so I guess the best thing to do in this case is cut out the middleman and sync directly from Wahoo/Garmin to TrainerRoad (and intervals.icu) and… that pretty much kills my primary use case for Strava\n\nAlso, lol:\n\nNote: Per our Community Guidelines and Guidelines to Ideas, posts requesting or attempting to have Strava revert business decisions will not be permitted.\n\nOkay, then. I’ll vote with my wallet instead.\n\nIt is definitely rich that Strava has implemented AI itself using data ** checks notes ** obtained via third party APIs but is apparently forbidding the reciprocation.\n\nI am still in “benefit of the doubt” mode as I haven’t read the full legalese but lol.\n\nI do wonder if they are aware of this they will rightfully stay quiet for the time being. If they unsure what this means for their integration with Strava it is usually best in the company’s interest to stay quiet until they get full clarify on the legal implications, if any.\n\nThat is part of the reason I skipped a tag for now.\n\nBut if this is so far reaching, I would have hoped that Strava might give a heads up to those potentially affected 3rd parties. Or not… and they are blindsiding them the same us average people?\n\nIt sounds like a very strong move.\n\nThe sort of thing that only a company that is exceptionally confident of its position in the market would do.\n\nI wonder if Strava would be classed as a monopolist and, if so, if this would be an abuse of its market power?\n\nWe have the post above from David (Intervals.icu) and I saw another on Reddit where developers shared that they were notified by Strava earlier than we (the users) were.\n\nThanks for sharing the Intervals.icu update, as I had asked this exact question. I believe this change means coaches will no longer be able to view our activities on Intervals/TrainingPeaks. If that’s the case, the only use I have for Strava is the heat maps, and I’m sure not paying their annual rate for that.\n\nFor what it’s worth, I have an API application and only got the notice about the changes two hours ago. Granted, it’s a very small application so maybe I didn’t merit any more advance warning (the only user is me, I’m using the API to show my own data on my own website, which it seems I’m not allowed to do anymore )",

When someone passes by, the music would play, which would be fun and could set a rhythm for others to follow during your activity.\n\nThe second suggestion is about the reporting of an activity in a segment.\n\nMy suggestion is to add a new reporting option, which would be \"Suggest activity change.\" For example, I’ve noticed that many cyclists don’t know how to switch from the running mode to cycling, so they end up receiving several reports that can negatively impact their account. In this case, if the person didn’t know how to change it, the report would prompt them with the option \"Was your activity a run or a ride?\" This way, they could change it without any issues.",

      "# [Strava closes the gates to sharing fitness data with other apps](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42190341)\nUnless Strava is aiming to get a GDPR fine, users can probably still access their data. What Strava is shutting down isn't data access, but rather their method for accessing the data without user intervention.\n\nYou can download a data export and upload it to whatever service you wish. You're not necessarily entitled to make Strava do that data sharing for you, though.\n\nIt's still a pretty shitty move from Strava's side. I wonder what AI model they're training (or other companies were training) with the data now no longer easily accessible through the API.\n\n> rather their method for accessing the data without user intervention.\n\nNonsense. The user did intervene: with an OAuth 2 flow. The user doesn't intervene with every API call or database query a data export makes.\n\nWhat you're really getting at is \"the user can't authorize someone else to look at their data\". That's like a hospital saying your spouse can't get an update on your condition in the emergency room because you didn't hand the documents to them yourself.\n\nIt's certainly well within their right to change this rule and cut off API access, but I suspect a lot of people are going to tell them to go screw themselves.\n\nIs it just me, or does The Verge's headline seem a bit clickbaity and not reflective of the actual change?\n\n> \"Strava closes the gates to sharing fitness data with other apps\"\n\nThis doesn't seem to be the case, with the quote they cite:\n\nEffective November 11, the updated API agreement introduces three key changes that provide Strava users with greater control, security, and a consistent experience: Stronger Privacy Standards: Third-party apps may now only display a user’s Strava activity data to that specific user. Users will continue to have access to their personal Strava data across apps connected to our platform, though there may be differences in how this data appears. Data Use Limitations: Our terms now explicitly prohibit third parties from using any data obtained via Strava’s API in artificial intelligence models or similar applications. Protecting the Strava Experience: Additional terms have been added to protect Strava’s unique look and feel and functionality, helping users easily distinguish between Strava and third-party platforms.\n\nThe restrictions seem to be:\n\n- You can only show that user's data to that user.\n\n- You can't use user's data to train AI models.\n\nSo it seems that you can still share your data to other platforms.\n\nOr am I missing something?\n\n> Training AI Models:\n\n> We believe in the potential of AI to transform the athlete experience–whether it’s delivering more personalized insights to help you reach your goals, generating route or training recommendations, or countless other possibilities. But innovation in this space must be handled responsibly and with a firm focus on user control. As part of our generative AI features, we are committed to implementing thoughtful solutions that prioritize user control and the ability to opt out.\n\n> Third-party developers may not take such a deliberate approach to training AI models and as a result, we believe the best decision for the platform and for users is to prohibit the use of data extracted from Strava users in this manner.\n\nTranslation: 'We want to consume your data for AI and we don't want anyone else to consume your data with AI. AI for me, not for thee. We own you and your data.'\n\nObviously they're totally enlightened and don't fit into that secondary category, as judged by themselves, and thus they deserve an exception to the policy. It's just all their potential competitors who might act unethically. Trust them, they know what's best for you and are only harming you because they care for you.\n\nI would be worried about the continued preservation of my data in the hands of someone who abuses it and uses such archetypical abuser tropes to justify their abuse.",

Was SO excited to think Intervals might bridge my TR workouts into Zwift. Any chance or plan to integrate TR into Intervals?\n\nAssuming if I manually built a TR workout into Intervals, THEN it would transfer over to Zwift? But then it’d just be a question of which is more difficult: building in Intervals, or creating a custom workout in Zwift…\n\nI was wondering why I couldn’t see my entire library but it seems like this only pulls for the upcoming 7 days scheduled. Is it possible, and if so are there plans to incorporate something that will allow the entire library from .icu to show up in that folder on Zwift?\n\nUnfortunately I now have double workouts, one from the Zwift API, the other from Strava. There is no cleanup function to delete or ignore the other. Two questions: what can I do to solve this? And are counting two workouts against my fitness and fatigue numbers?\n\nBy the way: Excellent work! That was the key moment I became a paying member!\n\nYou actually have one from Zwift and one from Wahoo. You need to delete one of those and decide where you want to get Zwift rides from in future.

The partnership is expanding globally following the duo’s initial tie-up in 2024.\n\nThe City Challenge includes 25 segments, or portions of roads and trails where Strava users can enter into friendly competition, across cities in North America and Europe. The user in each city that completes their segment the most between Jan. 2-31 will be awarded free Chipotle Lifestyle Bowls for a year.\n\nA leaderboard will display each city’s results, with the top-performing area rewarded with a buy-one, get-one-free entree offer. Additionally, Chipotle will launch an SMS activation around what the brand bills No Quitter’s Day, a counter to the day people are most likely to forfeit their New Year’s resolutions.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nChipotle is looking to capture the attention of the nearly 80% of consumers who have set health-oriented New Year’s goals with its expanded Strava partnership. The move, which promotes the QSR brand’s Lifestyle Bowls, follows a successful 2024 effort that saw Strava participants log over 9.25 million miles on Chipotle segments, the equivalent of circling the planet more than 370 times, according to Chipotle Chief Brand Officer Chris Brandt.\n\n“After seeing the passion our fans had for the initial launch with Strava, we had to increase access to the competition and raise the stakes,” Brandt said in a press statement.\n\nThe reupped partnership will now include a global presence, bringing Chipotle routes to the 25 most popular cities for the restaurant chain across North America and Europe. Among the cities included are New York City, London, Paris and Toronto. From Jan. 2-31, Strava users can compete to achieve Local Legend Status, an award designated to the person who completes the segment the most times, with each city’s Local Legend to be awarded free Lifestyle Bowls for a year.\n\nAlso new this year is a heatmap leaderboard that will showcase daily updates of each city’s performance. The city that ranks the highest by the end of the challenge will win a buy-one, get-one-free entree offer for their entire city, applicable to in-store orders. This marks the first time Strava segments will be pitted against each other as part of a brand-sponsored competition.\n\nChipotle will again market around Quitter’s Day on Jan. 10 via an SMS activation, flipping the script on the date when many people tend to give up on their New Year’s goals. From Jan. 2-9, consumers can visit a designated microsite to join a “Goals, Gym, Guac” text message community that will receive exclusive content from creators, motivational texts and affirmations. For what the brand has renamed No Quitter’s Day, members of the community will be sent instructions to get one of 50,000 free Lifestyle Bowls. Chipotle has promoted No Quitter’s Day since 2023.\n\nChipotle additionally is offering free delivery on Lifestyle Bowl orders in the U.S. on the Chipotle app and website from Jan. 2-31. Lifestyle Bowls, a digital exclusive menu item available in countries including the U.S., U.K., Canada and France, are chef-curated entrees that fit various diets, including keto, paleo and gluten-free needs.",
      "# [Get to Know a Skier’s Strava: John Steel Hagenbuch Goes Long. Very Long. on 2024-09-27](https://nordicinsights.news/2024/09/27/get-to-know-a-skiers-strava-john-steel-hagenbuch-goes-long-very-long/)\nBy Gavin Kentch\n\nWelcome back to “Get to know a skier’s Strava,” an occasional feature showcasing an athlete’s Strava account. Previously in this series: Federico Pellegrino, Michaela Keller-Miller, and Pål Golberg Eats Breakfast.\n\nThe mass of athletic men lead lives of quiet consistency, as I’m pretty sure Thoreau once said. There is no way to develop the aerobic capacity to succeed in this deeply demanding sport without a cumulative thousands of hours’ worth of easy distance under your belt; there is no way to reliably log, say, 800 hours of easy distance a year without being consistently conservative in your approach. Twenty weeks @ 40 hours apiece and forty weeks @ 20 hours both work out to the same total number of hours, but one of them is a great deal more likely to be sustainable in the long run.\n\nJohn Steel Hagenbuch is not most men, and he cares little for your physiological conservatism. Let’s take a look at his training for the week of September 2–8, 2024, humorously denominated on Strava as “Shrimp Week” for reasons that I am neither young nor hip enough to understand (yes I get that the leitmotif here is a movie that came out in 1994). Buckle up; what you are about to read may shock you.\n\nMonday morning: 50km rollerski\n\nAt 9:21 a.m. on Monday morning, Shrimp Week USA 🦐 2024 officially gets underway. John Steel Hagenbuch does a 50km rollerski, in 2:25. Impressive for many mortals, but likely not a huge physiological undertaking for Steel Hagenbuch, who V2s with a fluidity belying its grace and strength, and who logs 50km rollerskis far more frequently than your typical athlete.\n\nAverage HR here is 144, so overall this may be a moderate effort for someone with a MHR well over 190, though that figure hides some consistent periods of elevated HR over several climbs. The back roads of New Hampshire look somewhere between perfect and idyllic here; I am jealous.\n\nMonday afternoon: 49km rollerski\n\nWe’re already at 4:20 (lol) on Monday afternoon, and this is our first sign that this is not going to be a normal week. Steel Hagenbuch heads north this time, on a tridentine route into eastern Vermont, knocking out another 49 kilometers in just over three hours on his feet.\n\nOne of his videos embedded in this post captures a peaceful moment on an empty road. Dusk approaches. The world quiets; crickets are chirping. And still Steel Hagenbuch rolls on.\n\nIt is now Monday evening. The man has already logged a cool 99km, and 5:15 moving time, for the day. This is roughly equivalent to my highest *weekly* rollerski total from the past summer (I run a lot, okay).\n\nTuesday morning: 65km rollerski\n\nMonday evening’s workout concluded after 7 p.m., if you read elapsed time against starting time and do the math. Less than 14 hours later, Steel Hagenbuch is at it again. He goes north and east this time, out to Lyme, New Hampshire, and back. Detours slightly mid-roll to log a dozen repeats up a short climb. Picks up a KOM on a 118-meter hors catégorie climb earlier in the ski, ascending an eight-percent grade with his HR at a chill 153.\n\nAverage HR for this morning’s workout, in toto, is 123. Speaking of chill.\n\nTuesday afternoon: 45km rollerski\n\nTuesday afternoon, Steel Hagenbuch is back onto the rollerskis once more. Into Vermont this time, and “just” 45km this time, but also that’s still well over 100 kilometers of cumulative rollerskiing for the day.\n\nThe average HR for this session is 117, MHR a sedate 134. I’m going to have some pronounced “don’t try this at home, kids” cautions at the end of this article, but in all seriousness, if there is a broader takeaway from this profile that anyone can use, it’s that you really do have to ramp down the effort when you increase the volume. This week is just a memorably extreme exemplar of that moral.\n\nWednesday morning: 107km rollerski\n\nWednesday morning: for a change of pace, some rollerskiing.\n\nSteel Hagenbuch knocks out the century mark in one fell swoop this time, leaving the Dartmouth campus at 9:27 a.m., swinging by in the early afternoon for, I would hope, a whole lot of food, then heading out again for another 40+ kilometers after lunch.\n\nThe entire rollerski — 107 kilometers, 6+ hours — takes place over two large loops, with basically no overlap. I’m not sure there are 107 kilometers in the entire state of Alaska combined where I would feel comfortable rollerskiing on the roads like this… we do “rural” here, sure, but not so much “chill rural farm roads.” Or farms, for that matter. New England, man.\n\nIt is now Wednesday afternoon, less than halfway through the week. Steel Hagenbuch has already logged 316 kilometers’ worth of rollerskiing across 17.5 hours’ worth of training time. This would not be out of place as the cumulative rollerski training load for a top World Cup skier — which Steel Hagenbuch demonstrably is — for the entire week.\n\n(There’s a lot of different ways to get to 25–30 hours in a week, and individual athletes will adjust ratios for individual needs and capabilities, but 15+ hours of rollerskiing, 7–10 hours of foot or foot with poles, a couple hours for strength, and the rest on the bike or other training modalities would not surprise me in a high-end skier’s training log.)\n\nSteel Hagenbuch, for his part, has hit this mark by Wednesday afternoon.\n\nWednesday afternoon: 29-mile road bike ride\n\nSlightly less than one hour later, Steel Hagenbuch is back out the door on a Wednesday night group ride, his first non-rollerski training of the week. I’m glad he’s giving his upper body a rest, I guess?\n\nBut not so much his legs. Dude claims the KOM on a popular climb plus several other segment top-10s in the process; he is not going slowly out there. Though he does this all with a MHR of 175 and an average HR of 142, a difficult achievement for most people. But Steel Hagenbuch, if you had any doubt whatsoever remaining by this point, is not most people. (Is he even human? Discuss.)\n\nThursday morning: 60km rollerski\n\nThursday early afternoon: Track workout\n\nThursday evening: 40km rollerski\n\n“This is the most sicko double day of all time,” one admiring/appalled commenter had written on Strava of Wednesday’s exertions.\n\nIf you found Wednesday notable, and you probably should, then get ready for Thursday. The morning session brought another 60km of rollerskiing… early afternoon saw a track workout… and then the evening saw 40km more rollerskiing to hit an even 100km for the day. That is, combined, 100km and 5:38 of rollerskiing, plus another 48 minutes on foot. My goodness.\n\nBack to that track session for a second:\n\nThe morning’s rollerski workout commenced at 9:19 a.m. and had an elapsed time of 3:34 (against a moving time of 3:22; dude spent a whopping 12 minutes total stopped to eat, drink, or photograph in a 3.5-hour ski), so Steel Hagenbuch was on his feet on rollerskis until 12:53 p.m.\n\nA full 30 minutes later, at 1:23 p.m., a warmup run for a track session ensues. Assuming that it took, say, just five minutes total to remove and stow rollerski gear and put on running gear, that leaves 25 minutes’ worth of transition time. I hope that the intermezzo from ca. 12:56–1:21 p.m. was luxuriant. And filled with a lot of food, given the 60-kilometer rollerski just concluded.\n\n… but maybe not too much food, because now it was time for, I think, 8 x 400 on the track.\n\nAnd that’s still not all! A little less than three hours later, it was time for the final 40km of rollerskiing on the day. This bagatelle of a workout — at 40 kilometers it was the shortest rollerski of the week lol — commenced at 5:13 p.m., and saw our hero out on the roads until 7:48 p.m. Sunset in Hanover on September 5 was at 7:09 p.m., with civil twilight concluding at 7:37 p.m. Suffice to say that Steel Hagenbuch is not going gentle into that good night out there.\n\nFriday morning: 110-mile road bike ride\n\n110 miles, 7,200 feet, just under 6 hours on the bike. In the abstract, this is substantial, but not an atypical weekend long ride for a dedicated roadie. In practice… suffice to say that your typical weekend warrior road cyclist has not logged 416 kilometers of rollerskiing in the past four days as warmup.\n\nFriday afternoon: (nothing)\n\nAnd on the afternoon of the fifth day, John Steel Hagenbuch rested.\n\nSaturday: 145km rollerski\n\n“This activity is John Steel’s longest roller ski on Strava!” reads a cheerful badge accompanying this entry. Joyce’s longest sentence, Faulkner’s longest paragraph, and John Isner’s longest tennis match are all jealous.\n\nThis, for me, is where the entire enterprise shifts from the deeply impressive but still theoretically intelligible to the simply obscene. Over eight hours on rollerskis. Nearly 10 hours on his feet total elapsed time. In the rain. 561 kilometers of rollerskiing for the week.\n\nThis is beyond real. This is hyperreal. Move over, Disneyland; Baudrillard has new fodder for analysis here. I bet he was a huge nordic ski fan.\n\nSunday: 5.5-hour, 34-mile run\n\nAn easy five-and-a-half hours on his feet to finish things off. No big deal. Plus the week’s first and only photograph of an actual shrimp; I respect the extended buildup to this final sight gag.\n\nFor the week, that totals, per Strava, 45 hours of training time on the nose. 852km total distance, with 11,769 meters of elevation gain (that’s 529 miles and 38,600 feet in American). This is two weeks’ worth of training for some pro skiers. A month’s worth of training for an ambitious citizen racer. Six to even eight weeks’ worth of training for some midpack skiers. All in seven days.\n\nThese totals are, well, obscene, but are not too far outside the standard range for high-volume endurance sport athletes. I was going to write something like, “pro triathletes log 40-hour weeks pretty consistently,” but one Kristian Blummenfelt (2020 Olympic gold medalist) doesn’t have anything over 35 hours listed on his Strava from the last year, so, ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.\n\nTurning to speedskating, Nils van der Poel, who by any standard was an outlier, built an aerobic base off of 33 hours of largely stationary cycling within a week a five-day training week… but he also writes, “If I wanted to go for a trip with my friends Thursday–Sunday I would squeeze in 30 hours of training Monday–Wednesday and then have four days of no training.” van der Poel retired two years ago with world records and Olympic gold medals in both the 5,000m and 10,000m to his name, so the somewhat outré training distribution of 33 hours in five days — or even 30 hours in three days — seems to have worked for him.\n\nCloser to home, and back to this sport, Noah Hoffman stacked up 35-hour weeks pretty consistently during what I would describe as his infamous year of infamous hours, in which he increased his hours to a round 1,000, from something like 750 the season prior, in an attempt to become the fittest athlete in the men’s World Cup field.\n\nAnd while the precise training of the APU Elite Team is a state secret around these parts, it is safe to assume that multiple men in Anchorage logged at least 30 hours a week on several occasions this past summer. Indeed, here’s APU athlete Garrett Butts referring to “another 4 digit season of training in the log” for the 2022/2023 training year, and here he is earlier this month discussing “get[ting] dug out of a hole while training 27+ hours/week.” If you’re at a 1000+ hours for the season overall, and you have any degree of periodization for a several-month race season, simple math suggests that you’re going to be around 30 hours/week for much of the summer.\n\n… finally, Kílian Jornet seems to have logged 268 hours in one recent 19-day binge of linking up all 82 Alpine peaks over 4,000 meters under only human power — that’s roughly 14 hours a day, or 98 hours a week, for nearly three weeks straight. But his Strava for this, while perhaps the single most impressive Strava entry of all time, only mentions bike and feet, so Steel Hagenbuch still gets the nod here on rollerski time.\n\nIn conclusion, unless you are John Steel Hagenbuch or someone else of his ilk, you should not train this much volume. (And if you are that good a skier, there’s no way you’ll be taking training advice from me, anyway.) But no matter how long you’re going for, you should probably go easier than you think you need to, and eat more food than you think you need to, to help make it sustainable. I hear that shrimp are pretty nutrient-dense, and a good source of protein.\n\nYou’re reading this on Nordic Insights, one man’s labor of love dedicated to publicizing American nordic skiing. Last season’s GoFundMe is literally the only reason why I turned a profit in year one of Nordic Insights, and in turn the only reason why there is a year two of Nordic Insights for you to be reading now: I was okay with working for very little money to get this love letter to American cross-country skiing off the ground, but I didn’t want to lose money for the privilege of doing so. If you would like to support what remains a brutally shoestring operation, this season’s GoFundMe may be found here. Thank you for your consideration, and, especially, for reading.",
      "# [New Feature - Strava integration on 2024-09-16](https://forum.freeletics.com/t/new-feature-strava-integration/17613)\nHey Athletes\n\nAnother exciting update has been released today—one that many of you here on the Forum have requested\n\nStarting with app version 24.35, you now have the opportunity to incorporate your Strava activities into the Freeletics app, meaning that Strava activities will count towards your Daily Athlete Score consistency metric and your Base\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nMake sure you have updated to the latest versions of both Freeletics and Strava apps.\n\nOnly activities recorded after enabling the sync will be included.\n\nStrava activities must be set to “public” for successful synchronization.\n\nHow to enable the integration\n\nOpen the Freeletics app.\n\nNavigate to Profile → Settings → Connections.\n\nToggle the Strava switch on.\n\nAuthenticate with your Strava credentials.\n\nHow to manage the integration\n\nGo to Profile → Settings → Connections.\n\nToggle off the Strava switch.\n\nChoose between:\n\n-Disable and Keep Past Data.\n\n-Disable and Delete Past Data.\n\nPlease be aware that disabling the integration from Strava will result in the removal of all synced data from Freeletics, which will affect your metrics.\n\nPlease remember\n\nRemoving past data from the Freeletics app will also affect Base and Consistency scores, and impact streaks and DAS Consistency.\n\nTo prevent duplicate entries, enable only one integration at a time (e.g. Apple Watch or Strava).\n\nIntegration is active from the day of enablement; previous activities won’t sync.\n\nOnly public activities in Strava will be synced.\n\nHi Dominic,\n\nWe understand the desire for Garmin integration and appreciate your feedback. The primary reason we implemented the Strava integration is to provide a solution for Athletes whose wearables, including Garmin and others, do not sync directly with Freeletics via Google or Apple health integrations.\n\nBy using Strava as a point of connection, we enable many Athletes to connect their activities, even if their specific wearables are not supported. This approach allows us to support a broader range of devices, including also WHOOP and FitBit, through one platform and integration.\n\nThank you for sharing your question!\n\nHey Sylvain,\n\nthanks for the explanation! i think alot of the strava users are glad to have the feature.\n\nAlso most strava users are using a smartwatch to track - wouldn´t it be nice to have a smartphone/Garmin/Polar/etc. App to track the workouts? And also have a direct connection to Garmin Connect for example? - That would make everything so much easier\n\nBR Dominic\n\nHi Freeletics team!\n\nSo I have strava and Garmin. If I have garming connect connected to strava, the activity appears in strava too. So now with this feature I will get the activity from my garming to freeletics finaly automaticaly?\n\nSo far i had to cheat and write to goggle fit an activity, but i am new, and one day and many will forget.\n\nI am really happy that Strava now links with this as it allows me to keep my consistency rating high when I do things like swap out a gym session for a long uphill hike.\n\nThe only issue I am having is that when I use the app for a session, also tracking it on my Garmin, it ends up double loading.\n\nI will have strength training x2 and I am unsure how I can delete one of these logs."

Complaints include the feed displaying older activities at the top, making it difficult for users to see their most recent workouts [(Community Hub, Strava, 2024)](https://communityhub.strava.com/general-chat-2/activities-missing-in-feed-3859).\n\n## Executive Insights\n\nMichael Martin, the CEO of Strava, emphasized the company's commitment to enhancing user experience through community feedback and technological advancements.

However, the company faces challenges related to user satisfaction, particularly concerning recent acquisitions and changes to the platform. As Strava moves forward, addressing user concerns and enhancing product offerings will be crucial for maintaining its competitive edge and fostering community loyalty. \n\nFor prospective candidates and investors, Strava's commitment to innovation and community engagement presents a promising opportunity, albeit with the need for careful navigation of user sentiment and product integration challenges."
