The platform also offers features like activity management, clubs, sponsored challenges, and API access for developers [(Strava Company Overview)](https://communityhub.strava.com/).\n\nStrava operates on a B2C model, catering to individual athletes and fitness enthusiasts. It generates revenue through subscription plans, including a Family Plan and a Student Plan, and partnerships with businesses for sponsored challenges and collaborations [(Strava Company Overview)](https://communityhub.strava.com/) [(Strava, PR Newswire, May 16, 2024)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/strava-unveils-new-chapter-of-accelerated-product-development-at-brands-flagship-event-302146990.html).\n\nThe company has raised a total of $151 million in funding, with significant investments in 2020 and earlier years [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/strava). Strava's distribution is primarily digital, with its app available on mobile devices and its services accessible via its website.\n\nStrava is described as a community-centric platform that emphasizes user engagement and interaction. It is known for fostering a culture of community, engagement, and support among athletes [(Strava Company Overview)](https://communityhub.strava.com/).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nMichael Martin is the CEO of Strava.

His leadership reflects a focus on innovation and community-driven experiences [(Strava, PR Newswire, May 16, 2024)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/strava-unveils-new-chapter-of-accelerated-product-development-at-brands-flagship-event-302146990.html).\n\n# News\n\n## Product Developments and AI Integration\n\nIn May 2024, Strava announced a focus on accelerating product development through AI integration. This includes features like AI-enabled Leaderboard Integrity to ensure fair play by flagging irregular activities [(Strava, PR Newswire, May 16, 2024)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/strava-unveils-new-chapter-of-accelerated-product-development-at-brands-flagship-event-302146990.html).\n\n## Privacy and API Changes\n\nStrava has made significant changes to its API agreement to enhance user privacy. These changes limit how third-party applications can access and display user data, including prohibiting the use of Strava data in AI model training [(Strava, DCRainmaker, Nov 19, 2024)](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/11/stravas-changes-to-kill-off-apps.html).\n\n## Community Engagement Initiatives\n\nStrava has launched initiatives to increase female participation in sports, such as Night Heatmaps and the Strive for More® initiative, which supports women in sports through partnerships and donations [(Strava, PR Newswire, May 16, 2024)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/strava-unveils-new-chapter-of-accelerated-product-development-at-brands-flagship-event-302146990.html).\n\n## Collaborations and Partnerships\n\nIn January 2025, Strava announced a collaboration with Apple Fitness+ to integrate their services, aiming to motivate and reach more active people. This partnership includes new workout programs and Strava integration with Apple Fitness+ [(Ashley King, 2025-01-07)](https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/01/07/apple-fitness-adds-dedicated-workouts-from-musicians/) [(STRAVA, 2025-01-03)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/strava-and-apple-fitness-collaborate-to-motivate-and-reach-more-active-people-in-the-new-year-302336274.html).\n\nStrava also partnered with Chipotle to reward runners in London with free lifestyle bowls and introduced \"The City Challenge\" in 25 markets globally [(Chipotle Mexican Grill, 2025-01-02)](https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/chipotle-and-strava-to-reward-runners-in-london-with-free-lifestyle-bowls-to-kick-off-2025-302341355.html).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nStrava remains a dominant player in the fitness tracking space, with a strong community and innovative features. However, recent changes to its API and user feedback on product usability suggest a need to balance privacy and functionality. Strava's ability to adapt to user needs while fostering a connected community will be crucial for its continued success. The company's collaborations and focus on AI integration highlight its commitment to innovation and community engagement.",

The main consequences are twofold\n\n1) Putting backcountry users at higher risk of injury and/or death with no reliable map guiding information and having to rely on paper maps.\n\n2) Making life harder and less fun for those who plan backcountry excursions. Fatmaps provided exceptional mapping and descriptions of routes - to relieve the stress of route planning for outdoor recreationists. \n\nStrava clearly saw Fatmaps as a \"superior potential competitor\" in the next few years if Fatmaps decided to add in features that Strava currently offers. Easiest way to ensure this doesn't happen...buy the app and shut it down. Strava needs to look deeply in the mirror and figure out how they want to be perceived.",

The weird AI integration recaps what I already knew about my workout and makes me feel as though I have no sense of what’s going on with my body.  I can’t stand reading the recaps. \n\nStrava also messed up with the Fatmap integration.  They purchased a useful product and destroyed the features that made it so.

Strava seems to be struggling with 3D basics.\n\nMaybe this is all intentional and Strava is redesigning itself to alienate a segment of users like myself.  After 6+ years as a loyal user I’m looking for Strava alternatives (my Garmin app combined with OnX backcountry seems like a good combo) - I find the app increasingly cumbersome, commodified and useless.

In general, I really really like the app. It’s relatively easy to use and I’m happy that it’s able to get your heart rate from the Apple Watch.\n\nThat said it’s missing two key features. The first feature is the fact that you cannot, use the Apple Watch and the iPhone together at the same time. The reason I find this important is even though I may look on my Apple Watch most of the time while I’m hiking or any other activity and my phone is away, there are times when I’m hiking that I would like to see the map with the track I’m following and progress on the map itself. The only way to make this possible if you only use your phone without the watch at all. Even if you start your track on your phone, you cannot view the current status on the watch. i’m not saying to put the map on the Apple Watch as that would be quite difficult to navigate but in times you get lost and you want to see where you are on the map that’s impossible if you start it from the Apple Watch. Note, This is much different than syncing the Apple Watch and the iphone app. That sync has been seamless, but that sync can only occur after the fact which doesn’t help if your off the track and want to get back on the track. \n\nThe other aspect of the Apple Watch that is missing is the fact that you cannot rearrange the stats as you viewing them. I like seeing my mileage and it seems to be the smallest thing on the screen, and you have no way to edit the data view screen on the  watch. Slight inconvenience but if you need glasses to read, I would want to put the things that are important in larger text and up toward top. \n\nNote all that said the app is excellent and works as designed. If it had the features above, it would be a clear five star app for me",

      "# Why Did You Buy and Delete Fatmaps?, 1 stars [(hockeyboybrad, Apple App Store, 2024-12-29)](https://apple/12121293583)\nFatmaps was an unbelievable app that provided invaluable resources to backcountry skiers, hikers, campers etc. \n\nStrava comes in and buys the app and \"integrates\" it with Strava. This means all of it's useful features were deleted and Fatmaps is basically gone. The main consequences are twofold\n\n1) Putting backcountry users at higher risk of injury and/or death with no reliable map guiding information and having to rely on paper maps.\n\n2) Making life harder and less fun for those who plan backcountry excursions. Fatmaps provided exceptional mapping and descriptions of routes - to relieve the stress of route planning for outdoor recreationists. \n\nStrava clearly saw Fatmaps as a \"superior potential competitor\" in the next few years if Fatmaps decided to add in features that Strava currently offers. Easiest way to ensure this doesn't happen...buy the app and shut it down. Strava needs to look deeply in the mirror and figure out how they want to be perceived.",

The price for the app is outrageous and they’ve removed almost every single feature from the free version. I paid for the full app for several years but just cancelled my subscription. \n\nAlmost all my local segments are created or owned by cheaters. There’s someone who claims they ran a 3 min mile near my house. I’ve reported it several times. Nothing is done and I’m not the only one who complains. Look at any group of segments and you’ll find hundreds of fake or false records. Strava does nothing to fix, verify or remove them. \n\nIn the last year or so they made it so you HAVE to make your profile public to do segments but all that does is let people stalk you and DM you. I’ve had several stalkers locate me on other social media because they found me on Strava. I can’t record segments in a private profile. This is highly dangerous in my opinion. \n\nStrava only cares about making money. If you want actual data and analytics, use Garmin. Strava has turned into an expensive dating app for stalkers.",

The weird AI integration recaps what I already knew about my workout and makes me feel as though I have no sense of what’s going on with my body.  I can’t stand reading the recaps. \n\nStrava also messed up with the Fatmap integration.  They purchased a useful product and destroyed the features that made it so. Fatmap standalone app was easy to load, pan and zoom, find slope angles, and study routes planned or travelled.  Strava seems to be struggling with 3D basics.\n\nMaybe this is all intentional and Strava is redesigning itself to alienate a segment of users like myself.  After 6+ years as a loyal user I’m looking for Strava alternatives (my Garmin app combined with OnX backcountry seems like a good combo) - I find the app increasingly cumbersome, commodified and useless.

      "# Almost 5 stars but Apple Watch Integration seems like an afterthought, 4 stars [(Puzzle0227, Apple App Store, 2024-09-14)](https://apple/11724411163)\ni’ve been using this app for sometime now. In general, I really really like the app. It’s relatively easy to use and I’m happy that it’s able to get your heart rate from the Apple Watch.\n\nThat said it’s missing two key features. The first feature is the fact that you cannot, use the Apple Watch and the iPhone together at the same time. The reason I find this important is even though I may look on my Apple Watch most of the time while I’m hiking or any other activity and my phone is away, there are times when I’m hiking that I would like to see the map with the track I’m following and progress on the map itself. The only way to make this possible if you only use your phone without the watch at all. Even if you start your track on your phone, you cannot view the current status on the watch. i’m not saying to put the map on the Apple Watch as that would be quite difficult to navigate but in times you get lost and you want to see where you are on the map that’s impossible if you start it from the Apple Watch. Note, This is much different than syncing the Apple Watch and the iphone app. That sync has been seamless, but that sync can only occur after the fact which doesn’t help if your off the track and want to get back on the track. \n\nThe other aspect of the Apple Watch that is missing is the fact that you cannot rearrange the stats as you viewing them. I like seeing my mileage and it seems to be the smallest thing on the screen, and you have no way to edit the data view screen on the  watch. Slight inconvenience but if you need glasses to read, I would want to put the things that are important in larger text and up toward top. \n\nNote all that said the app is excellent and works as designed. If it had the features above, it would be a clear five star app for me",

Why do you use Strava: for performance metrics? To create routes? Or just for the social aspect?\n\nIf you want all in one, there's no alternative. Strava is king.\n\nFor the social part, Strava is also the best one by far. Seeing your friends or local club workouts, giving kudos, segments and all that stuff. For everything else, you have free alternatives that are arguably better.\n\nFor performance and workout analysis: if you have a Garmin device, you can use Garmin Connect. All other major brands will have their own cloud platform as well, for free (Polar, Suunto etc). If you want to keep things local, there's [GoldenCheetah](https://www.goldencheetah.org/). If you use your phone for tracking, then there's a huge selection of good apps to track your workouts, but I can't comment as I haven't tried many (I'm stuck to Garmin).\n\nTo create routes, there's [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/) (free in your own region) and [Bikemap](https://www.bikemap.net/). Even Google Maps nowadays will do a more-or-less decent job in developed countries. UPDATE: also [Ride with GPS](https://ridewithgps.com/).\n\nFinal option is to keep using Strava and extend it with 3rd party services. For workout analysis, there's [https://intervals.icu](https://intervals.icu) (consider donating!). For automations, calendar export, weather and Spotify data, component tracking and some other extra bits, there's [https://strautomator.com](https://strautomator.com) (disclaimed: I'm the dev). If you want to automate changes to activities using sensor data also from Garmin, there's [https://activityfix.com](https://activityfix.com). And the list goes on, you can find many more at [https://www.strava.com/apps](https://www.strava.com/apps).\n\n### Comment ID jah5ivg with +17 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-03-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/11eyn9p/ive_seen_a_lot_of_people_like_me_frustrated_at/jah5ivg/) (in reply to ID jagvfuh):\nSurprised ride with gps was left off rout creation.\n\n#### Comment ID jaifj61 with +5 score by [(igoramadas, Reddit, 2023-03-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/11eyn9p/ive_seen_a_lot_of_people_like_me_frustrated_at/jaifj61/) (in reply to ID jah5ivg):\nYou are 100% right.

But I think now the segments are. Aside from the exercise measurements and recordings, it is really the only key differing feature (Garmin Connect offers heaps of analytics).\n\nThe genius of Strava is getting people to create segments for them. Crowd sourced data in that way is clever by any company. To replicate that would be difficult, and an automated way would be possibly but difficult (some AI based scripting would be required to make logical segments).\n\nI personally am tending to use my Garmin Connect app more. I use the watch and I find the analytics pretty good. I think Garmin are really the ones to take advantage of Strava dropping the ball. By bettering Strava at its own game, they could perhaps pull people over to their hardware.\n\n### Comment ID jaia53p with +3 score by [(steester, Reddit, 2023-03-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/11eyn9p/ive_seen_a_lot_of_people_like_me_frustrated_at/jaia53p/) (in reply to ID jagvdka):\nI get the fun of segments, my friend is king of many of them.

It incorporates standard fitness tracking features like distance, elevation, and time, but goes further by infusing a light role-playing gaming (RPG) theme, complete with unique character development and elements like points, rewards, and course challenges that motivate users to remain active and achieve their fitness goals.\r  \n\r  \nYou can craft a unique narrative that transforms your running or cycling route into an exciting adventure.\r  \n\r  \nIn addition to these features, our app encourages user participation by allowing them to share their course creations, compete, or support one another through various courses. This fosters a dynamic and interactive fitness community.\r  \n\r  \nBy lightly gamifying fitness, we create a sense of enjoyment and purpose, turning exercise into an activity to look forward to and explore.\r  \n\r  \nOur app is tailored to individuals who are fitness-focused (not gamers) and seeking a more engaging and enjoyable way to track their outdoor activities. By merging social fitness and gaming we hope to create a community of adventure seekers who use our mobile app to explore the great outdoors while reaching their fitness goals.\r  \n\r  \n*/end-of-pitch*\r  \n\r  \nI believe there is a cross-section of us athletes that would enjoy having a little more colour and imagination with our fitness tracking tools.  I’m open to gathering any feedback to help MVP this venture and expand our options from the status quo.

Heart rate seems to be weighted more than duration. Therefore, if you do the EXACT same route at the EXACT same pace twice, and the second time you have increased your (real) fitness, you would actually expect your heart rate to be lower the second time. But strava will give you a lower score for the second run/ride. If you continue to do this, your score will decrease overall.\n\nNow I understand that there is some consideration of decreasing returns - i.e. if I really just do exactly the same run on the same route with the same pace all the time, eventually I will be challenging myself less and less, and instead of increasing my fitness I will switch to just maintaining, and maybe eventually I actually will decrease (?). But the fact that strava's fitness score would immediately consider this a decrease seems like a fundamental mistake.\n\nFeel free to let me know where I've gone wrong because I really like strava and metrics and I would love to be wrong.\n\n### Comment ID i1tfw1f with +7 score by [(MillennialHOA, Reddit, 2022-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/tkuc24/what_is_a_good_strava_fitness_score_my_thoughts/i1tfw1f/) (in reply to ID i1td7wq):\nIndividually this is right, each subsequent effort with a lower heart rate would individually impact the score less. That said, it is a reported as a cumulative score, so if I did exactly the same event starting from a score base of 0 my cumulative score would go up each day, say by 5, then 4, etc; so ultimately 5>9>12>14>15>16 assuming no rest. I think this actually does account for the concept of diminishing returns well.\n\nAgreed it is more tied to training load than actual fitness, but it's not quite as fundamentally misleading as implied.  I don't think it is a great measure of understanding total fitness, but it can be good as a baseline against which you can measure overall training. I've found it useful as a prompt to understand when I've really dropped from \"taking it easy\" to \"not doing much at all\" as well as a arbitrary number to show that I've been putting in a lot of effort (even if it is not yet reflected in a race effort, time, etc.)\n\n#### Comment ID i1tm2fc with +3 score by [(onlythisfar, Reddit, 2022-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/tkuc24/what_is_a_good_strava_fitness_score_my_thoughts/i1tm2fc/) (in reply to ID i1tfw1f):\nI agree that it works out when you first start training. But it's only cumulative over a certain rolling period (I seem to recall 40 days, weighted). So once you've done 40 days, if your individual score is less than the one that just rolled off, your total score goes down (or roughly. I don't entirely understand how the weighting works).\n\n#### Comment ID i1vc6ik with +1 score by [(bono_my_tires, Reddit, 2022-03-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/tkuc24/what_is_a_good_strava_fitness_score_my_thoughts/i1vc6ik/) (in reply to ID i1tfw1f):\nAre you saying that if I ride the same route twice even on zwift it takes the fact that it’s the same route into consideration?

As a stats nerd I want to drive the number up, but that is unrealistic term as my body still requires some rest (which brings the score down). For measuring fitness alone the stat seems misnamed. Still, comparing the score to my past self is a pretty good measure for how dedicated I have been to training.

I used to think the fitness score was more realistic than I do now. Now, after several years of strava use, the fitness score for me just roughly tells me if I'm increasing my load in a safe manner, if I am generally at a plateau in my fitness, or if I have been resting too much. \n\nIt seems to over value the \"historically hard\" workouts while under valuing functional strength training, and hard-sprint swims. Specifically, I think it places too much emphasis on workout length. I've done a very hard mile swim with a good heart rate and gotten a pathetic fitness score from it, +/-0, +10 effort. So, in those cases where it's massively undervaluing a workout, I'll switch from HR to \"perceived effort\" to get a more realistic feedback. \n\nThat said, I was working my ass off in the fall to improve run/swim times and got up to an 86 total fitness score. Life happened over the holidays and it settled back down to a 50-60. I broke my ankle and took several (8) weeks off and then hit the pool and gym again to build up. The fitness score has been a good way to follow a rough \"center mass\" of my fitness improvements. After 9 weeks I'm back up to a 45-52avg. And, honestly, I'd say I feel like I'm there and that's accurate.\n\nWhat the fitness score can't do is tell me that when my score was 80-85 that I wasn't cooling down, I wasn't stretching, my hamstrings sucked, and I was an injury waiting to happen. Since my injury I've been healing well, doing the knees over toes strength through flexibility approach, lifting weights and doing 20-40 mins of full body stretching each day. At a fitness score of 50 today I'd say I'm in a better place than that 80 last year.

Also, I hear you on over valuing historic efforts, very long running races impact the score the most for me but if I had to tell you what they did to my fitness it’s mostly flat or net negative as they require recovery and don’t actually leave me feeling as fit as a few milder training runs stacked for another week.\n\n### Comment ID i1sqd4n with +9 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/tkuc24/what_is_a_good_strava_fitness_score_my_thoughts/i1sqd4n/) (in reply to ID i1smarb):\nI also found it not really fair in general.

Skepticism is understood, that is my approach to most of these as well.

First, I use the Elevate extension in Chrome to get a better, more accurate score that let's you set different FTPs for different periods of the season. Strava itself only has one FTP entry that will retroactively change all your previous workouts that weren't at your brand new tested FTP.  Also it doesn't really make sense. I do Trainerroad low or medium volume and I'll barely gain 1 point a week. Rest weeks doing nothing or recovery only rides tanks the score every training block.

I did a 4 hour XC race and my fitness score went from 24 to 42. Intensity-wise, this was a relatively low intensity, basically a 50/50 split between Zone 3 and Zone 4 heart rate.\n\nThroughout 2021 I did some further racing and those events drastically bumped up my score. In between races I generally did much shorter rides to focus on intensity and sprinting. Between races, despite riding at least a few times a week, my fitness dropped over time.\n\nI'm not sure how they gauge the decrease i fitness but I think, for me, that makes the scoring less useful. A lot of other comments are similar to my feeling; I am no question more fit, I just may not be doing as many activities. Strava should really bench mark us against ourselves to work out our decline in fitness, if any, over time rather than the same assumption.\n\nMy personal opinion is that the relative effort isn't bad week-to-week, rather than this scoring system. For individual efforts, I prefer the Garmin training effect score. I'm not convinced there is a good way to measure long term fitness using the simple metrics Strava uses without way more analytics. For example, filtering out low efforts which are obviously not a test of fitness (i.e high itensity racing vs casual rides)\n\n### Comment ID i1xgy0n with +1 score by [(MillennialHOA, Reddit, 2022-03-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/tkuc24/what_is_a_good_strava_fitness_score_my_thoughts/i1xgy0n/) (in reply to ID i1wsmz5):\nWhoa, and +18 point jump is about the biggest I’ve heard of- though that is about linearly equal to what I’ve seen from a 2.5hr run, if you also consider that it’s a rolling average and assume your replacing a day that had no effort. I’ll have to check out Garmin’s score. \n\nI agree though that there is much more that does into this than just time and heart rate.

And there’s no “good” score.  And it isn’t useful to compare with other athletes.  In fact the Strava Fitness score is a representation of Chronic Training Load.  Ie how much you have stressed your body over a long (6?week) period.  If you aren’t actually very fit (in terms of aerobic base) and you run 5k in 30 mins you will earn a much larger contribution to your “Fitness” score than would a professional athlete (running the same course in the same time, as s/he would be not breaking a sweat), hence why comparisons are useless.  It’s only part of the picture, you could do a lot of training and get a high score but not be rested to race.  You need to consider your Acute (1 week) load too to determine how well you might actually perform in a race.  Search Training Peaks TSS, ATL, CTL and TSB for more info than I can be bothered to type.  Strava “Fitness” score is analogous with ChronicTraining Load (CTL)\n\n## Comment ID kaonmv4 with +1 score by [(Talby51, Reddit, 2023-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/tkuc24/what_is_a_good_strava_fitness_score_my_thoughts/kaonmv4/) (in reply to ID tkuc24):\nI remember keeping an eye on it during my last marathon training cycle a few years ago (last time I paid for a sub) and I found it pretty useless until factoring in the freshness scores along with the 'peak' overlay. Amazingly it all came together during my taper and I ran a much better time than I thought I could.\n\nIt was a mildly interesting thing to watch, but during the last 3 weeks I kept a close eye on how my freshness went up as I dropped off volume. Found it useful to have a metric other than \"how knackered do I feel\" to keep me focused on tapering in a way that worked for me and not everyone else I knew.\n\nAt the time the website version of it was much more informative than the app, not sure if that's changed recently but it's one of the reasons I cancelled my sub. Couldn't agree paying for a service where the app (which let's face it is much more accessible) has less functionality for viewing fairly simple metrics than the website.",

In this case, it sounds like OP just wants an app and uses their phone to track activity - this is great if it's the right thing for them, but we can't grumble when free things stop being free.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, if you are a regular user of Strava's premium features and value the community element that they provide, £55 a year is not an expensive cost. That's give or take four years worth of a new Garmin Forerunner 255 so it really is all down to what your need and your budget allow.\n\nBut free means people aren't getting paid.\n\n### Comment ID m2jryka with +1 score by [(JohnnyBroccoli, Reddit, 2024-12-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/1hg1egy/best_free_alternative_to_strava/m2jryka/) (in reply to ID m2gnrll):\nStrava is an absolute rip-off.

And even with the Varia - a lot of people don't realize it collects data on passing cars, including GPS coordinates and approaching speeds from the time it first picks up a vehicle until it passes you.\n\nI will say, though, that if you're a Peloton user, workouts will sync directly to Strava - but not Garmin Connect. Fortunately, there's a GREAT service called syncmyworkouts with takes care of all of that, never an issue, for $25/year. I do a Peloton ride, the moment Peloton's servers record it, it syncs with Garmin Connect (and pulls in a LOT of matching, detailed info), and then Garmin Connect uploads to Strava. This happens within 10 seconds of hitting 'stop' on the Peloton Bike or Tread Workouts.

There's no other platform that can match Strava socially due to it having 50m subscribers, but worst case I could live without that. RideWithGPS doesn't appear to have proper segment comparison and PRs etc (or at least not in the free version). \n\nThe most annoying thing with the Strava changes is that it's now near-impossible to compare your own progress without paying. I don't really care about comparing to other people, but I do want to see (say) my top 5 times on a particular segment. Basically now, unless I get a PR, I've no idea how my relative performance was (yes, I know, the solution is to PR every time ;) ).\n\nI wouldn't mind paying so much (I've been a paying Strava user for years in the past) but having recently returned to cycling after a few years off, I now find that Strava's developers are too incompetent to properly support BT/Ant+ HRMs in the app, so have dropped support altogether. Call me picky, but if I'm going to pay £60p.a. for a fitness app and service, having to use another free app (such as Wahoo) to actually record my rides makes the whole thing a bit of a shitshow.\n\nIf they added back proper support for HRMs, then I'd probably re-subscribe.

      "# Post ID 15xgg92: Maps recap FR265 on Strava or Garmin app with +1 score by [(wingoerts, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/15xgg92/maps_recap_fr265_on_strava_or_garmin_app/)\nHi ! I’ve been running a lot in the past few years and I for my fourth marathon preparation I decided to finally buy a running watch. I selected two models: Forerunner 265 and Forerunner 965. I know the price is different so my hesitation doesn’t come from here. \n\nI’m used to run with my phone only and to receive a recap with a small map showing the places I’ve been to (see picture below). I know FR265 doesn’t have a live map option (= navigation?) like FR965 or my running phone apps.\n\nI use Strava to share my workouts and that’s really important to me. I know I can synchronise my workouts from any of the two watches to Strava through the Garmin app, but will the map appear on Strava or the Garmin app if I use a FR265 (even if I cannot see the map on my watch)? That’s my real concern. I think FR265 shows a small drawing of the route I ran on, but does it record the names of the streets and cities? Can I run with a FR265 and without my phone?\n\nI really don’t need the live map from \n\nThank you very much, for your replies. I’m really new to smart watches (I’m 28yo, using an iPhone 13, if that helps).\n\n## Comment ID jx6detv with +3 score by [(Liveforreds, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/15xgg92/maps_recap_fr265_on_strava_or_garmin_app/jx6detv/) (in reply to ID 15xgg92):\nBoth the FR 265 and 965 have the ability to track your runs with GPS and, after syncing either watch with the Garmin app, you can view the running route on the map directly in the phone app. If you have your Strava account linked to your Garmin account, then your runs will sync to Strava as well. \n\nIn both Garmin and Strava, you can view the GPS route, including street names, cities, etc. Both maps also allow you to change to satellite view. However, as far as I’m aware, only Garmin will allow you to also include a “data overlay” on the running route where the running route becomes color graded to express faster/slower pacing, heart rate, and elevation.\n\nAs for mapping directly on the watch, the FR 265 does not have this feature so you will not be able to see a live map while running. When you finish a run, it shows the “shape” of your route on the watch and once the watch syncs with the phone, you’ll see the route on a map. With the FR 965, you can view the map while running and have directions if you’re running a course.\n\nYou can run without your phone using either watch, you just won’t have any cell service to text or make calls.\n\n### Comment ID jx73r2o with +1 score by [(wingoerts, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/15xgg92/maps_recap_fr265_on_strava_or_garmin_app/jx73r2o/) (in reply to ID jx6detv):\nThank you very much for your complete reply, it helped me a lot and I think I’ll go for the FR265 ! ⌚️\n\n## Comment ID jx6fo7f with +2 score by [(ChrisTexan1, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/15xgg92/maps_recap_fr265_on_strava_or_garmin_app/jx6fo7f/) (in reply to ID 15xgg92):\nYou are mixing watch \"map displays\" versus \"route recording\".  For workouts when completed, any/all dedicated sports ecosystems (Polar, Suunto, Coros, Garmin, Apple)currently out there, show what you did on a map/overlay.  And all are exportable or linkable to other platforms.  \n\nSo simple answer, any GPS recording you take on your watch, can auto-sync to Strava, which will overlay it with their maps.  And if you look at it in the device's portal/app, you can display it on a map (most default to that), and you can change from topo, to satellite, to road map, etc on most if not all.  \n\nAnd you can link to other services, like [Relive.CC](https://Relive.CC) for example, that can then do dynamic overlays with pictures, video, statistics along a fly-by route of what you did.  \n\nEven GPS watches that have NO \"preloaded routes/mapping/navigation\" features, still record the GPS in the file, and once it's sync'd to it's app/web, it's displayed/displayable on maps, it's just that the watch itself can't show it.\n\n### Comment ID jx73vl3 with +1 score by [(wingoerts, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/15xgg92/maps_recap_fr265_on_strava_or_garmin_app/jx73vl3/) (in reply to ID jx6fo7f):\nThank you very much !\n\n## Comment ID jx6pvsq with +1 score by [(Walksuphills, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/15xgg92/maps_recap_fr265_on_strava_or_garmin_app/jx6pvsq/) (in reply to ID 15xgg92):\nIf I understand correctly, yes.

This means all of it's useful features were deleted and Fatmaps is basically gone. The main consequences are twofold\n\n1) Putting backcountry users at higher risk of injury and/or death with no reliable map guiding information and having to rely on paper maps.\n\n2) Making life harder and less fun for those who plan backcountry excursions. Fatmaps provided exceptional mapping and descriptions of routes - to relieve the stress of route planning for outdoor recreationists. \n\nStrava clearly saw Fatmaps as a \"superior potential competitor\" in the next few years if Fatmaps decided to add in features that Strava currently offers. Easiest way to ensure this doesn't happen...buy the app and shut it down. Strava needs to look deeply in the mirror and figure out how they want to be perceived.",

Now the app only is a money making gimic and full of cheaters and stalkers. The price for the app is outrageous and they’ve removed almost every single feature from the free version. I paid for the full app for several years but just cancelled my subscription. \n\nAlmost all my local segments are created or owned by cheaters. There’s someone who claims they ran a 3 min mile near my house. I’ve reported it several times. Nothing is done and I’m not the only one who complains. Look at any group of segments and you’ll find hundreds of fake or false records. Strava does nothing to fix, verify or remove them. \n\nIn the last year or so they made it so you HAVE to make your profile public to do segments but all that does is let people stalk you and DM you. I’ve had several stalkers locate me on other social media because they found me on Strava. I can’t record segments in a private profile. This is highly dangerous in my opinion. \n\nStrava only cares about making money. If you want actual data and analytics, use Garmin. Strava has turned into an expensive dating app for stalkers.",

I can’t stand reading the recaps. \n\nStrava also messed up with the Fatmap integration.  They purchased a useful product and destroyed the features that made it so. Fatmap standalone app was easy to load, pan and zoom, find slope angles, and study routes planned or travelled.  Strava seems to be struggling with 3D basics.\n\nMaybe this is all intentional and Strava is redesigning itself to alienate a segment of users like myself.  After 6+ years as a loyal user I’m looking for Strava alternatives (my Garmin app combined with OnX backcountry seems like a good combo) - I find the app increasingly cumbersome, commodified and useless. Not sure why I would pay annually for it collect my data, when I get superior fitness tracking features with Garmin.",

          "content": "i’ve been using this app for sometime now. In general, I really really like the app. It’s relatively easy to use and I’m happy that it’s able to get your heart rate from the Apple Watch.\n\nThat said it’s missing two key features. The first feature is the fact that you cannot, use the Apple Watch and the iPhone together at the same time. The reason I find this important is even though I may look on my Apple Watch most of the time while I’m hiking or any other activity and my phone is away, there are times when I’m hiking that I would like to see the map with the track I’m following and progress on the map itself. The only way to make this possible if you only use your phone without the watch at all. Even if you start your track on your phone, you cannot view the current status on the watch. i’m not saying to put the map on the Apple Watch as that would be quite difficult to navigate but in times you get lost and you want to see where you are on the map that’s impossible if you start it from the Apple Watch. Note, This is much different than syncing the Apple Watch and the iphone app. That sync has been seamless, but that sync can only occur after the fact which doesn’t help if your off the track and want to get back on the track. \n\nThe other aspect of the Apple Watch that is missing is the fact that you cannot rearrange the stats as you viewing them. I like seeing my mileage and it seems to be the smallest thing on the screen, and you have no way to edit the data view screen on the  watch. Slight inconvenience but if you need glasses to read, I would want to put the things that are important in larger text and up toward top. \n\nNote all that said the app is excellent and works as designed. If it had the features above, it would be a clear five star app for me",

While leadership is made up of nice people, they don't have the skills necessary to effectively lead the organization and get it out of this rut it's been in. There is a strong community of individuals with similar interests in fitness/sports at the company, but I feel like this can lead to an echo chamber effect sometimes. Over the course of my time there, it was disappointing to see several features fail to take off, and I believe the company would benefit from more reflection and analysis on what went wrong and how to improve moving forward. The multiple reorgs last year has led to a great deal of confusion among the employees - ways of working and processes are always changing. It also appears the company relies on verbal recognition as the primary form of award and not additional comp/bonuses when it comes to recognizing employees who go above and beyond.",

This is truly an organization that practices what it preaches in terms of diversity, work-life balance, and pay equality. I remember being so impressed in a company all-hands one day when the HR team announced a new initiative to examine gender pay equality within the company. This speaks volumes about the company, management, and the board to be dedicating resources to such a worthy issue. And this is just one of countless examples of Strava working to do the right thing. For me at a personal level, I always felt that my managers and colleagues were invested in my growth and development. While I did end up leaving Strava to pursue an education, there was always an open dialogue about where I wanted to go career-wise and folks did all they could to support that while I was there. We even had (free!) access to a full time career coach who was very influential in my choosing to move into development.",

We review our compensation regularly against benchmarking data to ensure that we are paying at least at the 50th percentile compared to market, and in many cases our compensation is much higher than that - especially when considering equity and our generous benefits package which is fully paid by Strava. We also have a great track record of promoting people from within. I'm sorry that wasn't your impression, and I'd welcome the chance to hear about your specific experience if you'd like to reach out. You can find me at michele@strava.com. Thank you for your contributions at Strava, and I'm wishing you well in wherever you go next!",

The engineering team has been investing a lot of effort over the last year to become more nimble and is moving to much faster releases, which makes us more nimble.\r\n\r\nPerks wise, it's tough to beat. Many of them are oriented around an athletic life style. On site yoga, pro deals with most gear manufacturers, stipends for new equipment and races, and fantastic health insurance, to name a few. Plenty of time off to make sure you can decompress or train. A few provided meals a week and otherwise plenty of snacks. We don't have three meals a day like many tech companies, but it's not a major downer, the local food is good and we all still eat lunch together away from our desks.",

Despite such shoddy decisions they are still tasked with running the show. Their is no accountability. - The senior leadership culture is very defensive. They push a culture where nobody can express a critique about anything. The smallest negative opinion or feedback is punished, and the all hands is used to publically shame the entire company to ensure even anonymously nobody says anything negative about leadership. The anonymous forum is a joke - all the responses are platitudes and gas-lighting of employees, with the aim to ensure nobody submits any further feedback. They keep saying come have a live conversation but when people go have a live conversation they punish them and take away their good projects. - The leadership team has their head in the sand about the business. They only listen to someone with no experience, who is pushing his personal agenda but knows how to butter up the senior leaders. - The company made a huge deal about being anti-racist.

Leading by example can be very inspirational and create a healthy space to be your best self and do your best work. \n\nCompany gathers for weekly all-hands meetings (physically and virtually), where the leadership team provides a transparent view of the Company, its goals and future initiatives, and creates a space for questions. What companies still do this???\n\nStrava colleagues help to maintain a low stress environment, even when dealing with tight deadlines. The amount of mutual respect afforded to one another is remarkable. \n\nIf you live near one of the current office locations, there are weekly work out sessions, and the leadership team often joins!\n\nStrava has incredible benefits! Compensation aside (which is very competitive), Strava has very generous benefit plans, and in addition, offers annual gear stipends to all employees. Working for a Company at the center of connected fitness, it makes sense to have the best gear to document those journeys! One of the employee perks that cannot be overstated are the industry discounts. Just wow! \n\nThis is truly a great place to be!",

This is truly an organization that practices what it preaches in terms of diversity, work-life balance, and pay equality. I remember being so impressed in a company all-hands one day when the HR team announced a new initiative to examine gender pay equality within the company. This speaks volumes about the company, management, and the board to be dedicating resources to such a worthy issue. And this is just one of countless examples of Strava working to do the right thing. For me at a personal level, I always felt that my managers and colleagues were invested in my growth and development. While I did end up leaving Strava to pursue an education, there was always an open dialogue about where I wanted to go career-wise and folks did all they could to support that while I was there.

They push a culture where nobody can express a critique about anything. The smallest negative opinion or feedback is punished, and the all hands is used to publically shame the entire company to ensure even anonymously nobody says anything negative about leadership. The anonymous forum is a joke - all the responses are platitudes and gas-lighting of employees, with the aim to ensure nobody submits any further feedback. They keep saying come have a live conversation but when people go have a live conversation they punish them and take away their good projects. - The leadership team has their head in the sand about the business.

There is a strong community of individuals with similar interests in fitness/sports at the company, but I feel like this can lead to an echo chamber effect sometimes. Over the course of my time there, it was disappointing to see several features fail to take off, and I believe the company would benefit from more reflection and analysis on what went wrong and how to improve moving forward. The multiple reorgs last year has led to a great deal of confusion among the employees - ways of working and processes are always changing.

      "# [How Hard Is It To Make Strava Art? on 2024-10-04](https://stories.strava.com/nl/articles/how-hard-is-it-to-make-strava-art)\nYou may have seen Strava Art in your feed, on Strava Stories, or even in the news, but have you ever wondered how hard it is to create a Strava masterpiece? Howard Calvert decided to find out...\n\nYou’ve no doubt seen some Strava art, if not on your own Strava feed, in our Strava Stories section, or even in the news.\n\nIf you haven’t, Strava art is the term given to an activity on Strava that creates a piece of art using the GPS map of the activity.\n\nSometimes it may happen inadvertently, for example when someone comments that your 10K run route looks “a bit like an arrow”, but usually it’s a finely tuned and intricately planned masterpiece, sometimes months in the making.\n\nRELATED: 13 Pieces of Strava Art That Made Us... Wow\n\nOver the past few years, these Strava art designs have become so impressive they deserve to be framed and displayed in a gallery. Recent jaw-dropping examples include Nicolas Georgiou’s koi carp in London, Lenny Maughan's Road Runner and BigBird DPS Art’s mind-bending Impossible (Penrose) Triangle.\n\nSo I decided to take up the challenge of creating my own Strava art. How hard could it be?\n\nStrava Art: The Hard Miles\n\nAs it turns out, it’s exceedingly difficult and I tip my cap to the athletes out there creating artwork that simply astounds in its design. How do they do it?\n\nI asked Nico Georgiou for his advice on how he creates work like his koi carp, Mark Cavendish for the TdF, and his seriously impressive, 237 mile / 383km-long ‘Something for the Olympics’. Based in London, his day job is as a designer, something he says helps inform his Strava artwork.\n\n“With any Strava art design, I start by looking at a map,” he says. “Then I just go for it. I throw my first navigation point down, second point, third point, and then I expand lines and move them around on the map.\n\nRELATED: Love Strava Art? How to Create Your Own Masterpiece\n\n“For me, the drawing itself isn’t the problem — it’s trying to find the infrastructure in the roads and how to navigate things like rivers and train tracks.”\n\nIf Nico’s design needs to cross a river — and he regularly crosses the Thames in his art — he pauses the recording, rides to the nearest bridge, crosses, and then rides to where the drawing will continue before unpausing, meaning Strava’s GPS will draw a straight line across the river to that point. This results in him cycling farther than the distance shown on the final artwork — sometimes up to 70km more.\n\nOther big challenges are one-way systems, getting over footbridges, London parks closing at night, even unexpected police cordons or roads closed due to roadworks.\n\n“There’s a lot of problem-solving,” he says. “The first problem is the planning and drawing stage.” This usually takes him five or six hours of initial drawing which are then intricately refined over the course of a month. “I start with a point A and point B, and fill in the space between. For the koi carp, there were 666 navigation points.”\n\nThe next problem is the actual drawing of it on his bike. “Study the map and work out exactly what you need to make it work when riding it,” he advises. “If there’s a one-way street, for example, I know I’ll have to hop off my bike and walk along the sidewalk, or put my bike over my shoulder and cross a footbridge.”\n\nRELATED: Around the World in Strava Art\n\nHe also warns that having fully-charged batteries is of paramount importance, for both your GPS systems and your bike lights. The koi carp took him around 20 hours in total, starting at 3.30 am. “I navigate via my phone, and record the ride on my Garmin.”\n\nBut, for Nico, it’s this combined challenge of designing the artwork and then completing it, that draws him back in time and time again. “That and the headspace it provides,” he says, “even though my wife thinks I’m mad!”\n\nFor me, the drawing itself isn’t the problem — it’s trying to find the infrastructure in the roads and how to navigate things like rivers and train tracks.\n\nStrava Art: Expert Advice\n\nNico’s tips for beginners wanting to have a go at their own Strava art include:\n\nStick to freeform ideas. Try not to do anything too regimented.\n\nAvoid circles. You need to go a huge distance to create a decent circle.\n\n“Planning is an important part of creating a successful piece of art,” says Nico. “If you’re on a bike, do it in a town with plenty of roads to make it work. If you’re running, my suggestion is to use a large empty field and prep the route with markers as reference points.”\n\nUse a route-building website, such as Strava’s route planner.\n\nStart drawing! As Nico says, begin with two navigation points and take it from there. Be as creative as you like, or keep it simple, with something like a heart or a star if you want to build confidence.\n\nSave and export your ride to your device, whether it’s a watch or bike computer.\n\nStart riding or running, following the route you designed.\n\nTry not to take any wrong turns, as that could ruin the end product.\n\nEnjoy your activity, soak up the new sights. At the end, it’s the moment of truth — view the final art in Strava, and publish it on your feed.\n\nArt Attack\n\nWith that advice in mind, I head out on my own art-based expedition. I know I want to keep it local, and to start with run rather than cycle. But what to design? I experiment with something basic — a heart on a large, open field — but quickly give up when I figure it will inevitably end up resembling a large blob.\n\nThen, it hits me: what would be more appropriate than the kudos sign? A thumbs up for all Strava users. I scan my local area for anything that might string together to form the symbol… eventually, I draw what I think is a good enough thumbs up using the Strava route planner.\n\nGET PLANNING: Strava Routes and Heatmap: Find New Places to Go\n\nBut while I’m there I get a little more ambitious. These grids of new housing could easily form eyes… with a nose, mouth, whiskers… it’s a cat! But I can’t get the ears to work due to a canal and roads inaccessible due to military use. Maybe it looks more like the Grinch? When I attempt to run it, I suddenly change my mind and realize it could be Mario, so I have to adjust parts of it on the fly, keeping Nico’s advice to “not do anything too regimented” at the forefront of my mind.",
      "# [Enhancing Strava Experience: Music Integration and Activity Reporting Improvements by Thi on 2024-09-27](https://communityhub.strava.com/general-chat-2/enhancing-strava-experience-music-integration-and-activity-reporting-improvements-6512)\nHello everyone, I have two cool suggestions for the app.\n\nThe first one would be the ability to add music to your activity on Strava. When someone passes by, the music would play, which would be fun and could set a rhythm for others to follow during your activity.\n\nThe second suggestion is about the reporting of an activity in a segment.\n\nMy suggestion is to add a new reporting option, which would be \"Suggest activity change.\" For example, I’ve noticed that many cyclists don’t know how to switch from the running mode to cycling, so they end up receiving several reports that can negatively impact their account. In this case, if the person didn’t know how to change it, the report would prompt them with the option \"Was your activity a run or a ride?\" This way, they could change it without any issues.",
      "# [Updates to Strava’s API Agreement on 2024-11-19](https://press.strava.com/articles/updates-to-stravas-api-agreement)\nUpdated on Nov. 19\n\nWe wanted to provide some additional context around the changes to our API Agreement and the impact for our users and developers. We currently anticipate these changes will impact less than .1% of applications and proactively notified the majority of those affected last week.\n\nEnhanced Privacy and User Control\n\nPrivacy and user control are at the forefront of our platform. As a result, we are committed to evolving our API practices as regulatory requirements and user expectations shift. This includes the decision to limit the ability of a user’s data to be displayed by third-party apps in ways the user may not expect. Specifically, we want to thoughtfully address situations where users connect to a third-party app and are unaware that their data is being surfaced not just for their own use and visibility, but also to other users (for example, in a public feed or heatmap). The latest API changes address this scenario and provide a more consistent framework for Strava user data.\n\nTraining AI Models\n\nWe believe in the potential of AI to transform the athlete experience–whether it’s delivering more personalized insights to help you reach your goals, generating route or training recommendations, or countless other possibilities. But innovation in this space must be handled responsibly and with a firm focus on user control. As part of our generative AI features, we are committed to implementing thoughtful solutions that prioritize user control and the ability to opt out.\n\nThird-party developers may not take such a deliberate approach to training AI models and as a result, we believe the best decision for the platform and for users is to prohibit the use of data extracted from Strava users in this manner. Our previous terms already disallowed the use of Strava user data in model training and development but we’ve made this more explicit in light of the increasing activity in this space.\n\nNo Impact to Most Developers\n\nWe recognize that our platform thrives because of the creativity and dedication of third-party developers who build tools to complement and extend Strava’s capabilities. We are steadfast in our commitment to fostering this ecosystem. We anticipate that these changes will affect only a small fraction (less than .1%) of the applications on the Strava platform–the overwhelming majority of existing use cases are still allowed, including coaching platforms focused on providing feedback to users and tools that help users understand their data and performance.\n\nCollectively, these changes reflect our commitment to ensuring that Strava remains a trusted platform for athletes and developers alike. That means holding ourselves—and anyone building on our platform—to high standards.\n\n###",

      "# [How to Create a Route with Strava’s Route Builder](https://partners.strava.com/resources/how-to-create-a-route-with-stravas-route-builder)\nFrom any account with an active Strava subscription, you can create new routes from scratch by clicking the Create New Route button near the top of the My Routes page or clicking the plus in the upper right of the header and selecting “Create a Route” from the drop-down menu.\n\nWhen you enter the route builder, first use the panel on the left-hand side to set your preferences.\n\nIf the map is not hovering over your current location, or you'd like your route to start elsewhere, you can use the search bar to center the map where you’d like to create a route.\n\nChoose between running, riding, walking, mountain biking, hiking, trail running, or gravel biking to generate routing optimized for each sport. If you choose a trail sport, dirt surfaces will be favored during route planning.\n\nStart building your route by clicking to the correct places on the map.\n\nIf you have a GPX file of the exact course handy, you can quickly and easily import the entire route into the Route Builder by clicking this button in the floating control panel and following the simple steps that appear on the screen.\n\nStrava’s Custom Waypoints feature allows you to tell users about key points of interest along a route. This can keep users informed of what’s coming up on the route or where they may be able to access key services like aid stations and water sources.\n\n1. To customize a Waypoint, simply click on it to reveal this menu.\n\n3. If there isn’t a waypoint at the exact location of the key route feature, you can always click on the route, then select “insert waypoint.” From there you can customize the waypoint as shown in the previous steps.",
      "# [New route builder is broken](https://communityhub.strava.com/general-chat-2/new-route-builder-is-broken-3865)\nPage 1 / 1\n\nI noticed the \"new\" route planner yesterday as well ... before it was only in the \"Heatmap View\" available, but now it seems they are using the same for planning a route. Which absolutley su##s! Beside of your described bugs it seems the Veloviewer plugin also does not work anymore - and therefore this route planner is getting for me more and more unusable. And as of now the route planner was the only feature for me to keep my payed membership. If they don't fix that I assume I finally will get a basic member looking for another route planner!\n\nI see the same broken behaviour, dragging outside of existing waypoints creates artifacts or doesn't do anything, dragging existing waypoints copies them instead of moving them and the undo button will not be enabled after such an action.\n\nglad you mentioned Veloviewer... the Wandrer.earth extension is broken as well 😒\n\nCame here to chime in on the route builder that keeps going downhill. For me too, this is the one feature I still have premium for, but every update it's just getting worse and I've already found myself returning to other tools. I'm a heavy user of (personal) heatmaps, and while the number of useless clicks seem to have increased, several functionalities are lost on the website...\n\n-The ability to see personal \"ALL RUN\" or \"all sports\" heatmaps while editing (trail run and regular run on seperate heatmaps why?).\n\n-The options to remove \"points of interest\" seems to be gone. I now have to constantly pay attention that I avoid clicking on other people's pictures in the map.\n\n@Dim The option to remove pictures and POIs is hidden behind this nondescript button I marked yellow:\n\nThis would be better as direct visible text in the sidebar, but as others remarked, the UX of the route builder is not very well thought out.\n\nRe: adding a new waypoint by clicking on the line and dragging -- it seems it works better now if you click on the line (not drag) and then select \"insert waypoint\" from this pop up menu. THEN drag that new one that appears.\n\nHey @danf879, Nick here from the Strava Web team. Thanks for taking the time to write in about the issues you're having with the new builder. Just to be sure I understand, are you having issues inserting waypoints (via click or click and drag) or are you expecting waypoints to appear on the route but they are not?\n\nIn this screenshot, is this a route you'd previously created and are now loading again in the builder? if it's a public route, would you mind linking it here so we can take a look. Looking forward to getting to the bottom of this, and thanks again for writing in.\n\nHi Nick-\n\nThanks for responding. I don't believe it's map specific -- I was able to recreate it on a new map, but unfortunately I couldn't tell you what triggers it. It may be related to the velocity of the click + drag, or if you drag to an area that's unmappable? I was able to capture an animation:\n\nIn better news, the Wandrer.earth plugin is working again!\n\nJust build a route and then try to change the route by dragging the route line to a different road.\n\nIt's completely impossible now.\n\nYep, very disappointed too. Had only recently started using this to plan \"titling adventures\" and now it's gone. Perhaps the only reason I needed to pay for Strava? Maybe time to look elsewhere. Does any other app support Veloviewer for planning routes based on tiles?\n\nEmailed veloviewer and got this back;\n\nHi Geoff\n\nThanks for the email. I've pushed out an update (V1.43). Just waiting for Google to release it. Can be a few hours, can be a day or two. No idea why it takes so long unless they have someone manually checking these things.\n\nHopefully it'll be updated and working by the morning 🤞\n\nBen Lowe\n\nVeloViewer.com\n\nAlso having several issues previously mentioned with this new route builder. Attempted using this fix and encountered a new bug, the route was split in half where the waypoint was moved and an invisible line remained as part of the route from the original points, see photo below as an example. Clearly the new route building features need some major changes before this new version is useful, Strava should revert back to the previous version until this is ready.\n\nVeloviewer plugin has been published (1.43) and all now seems to be OK.\n\nHey Dan,\n\nI had the same issues, but since thursday the problem seems to be resolved!\n\nIt does seem to be working better today for me.. at least, I can't reproduce the problem I showed in the animation above... maybe they fixed something??\n\nHi everyone - thanks for sending in these examples. We did push an update to solve some of the issues with click & drag behavior. Are any of you still seeing issues?\n\nFound this old thread and routes builder is completely broken for me in marin county usa. I use the route builder for our HS team routes for our team rides. There are now many, many places where route builder doesn't route appropriately. For example - it is impossible to get a route to go from Ross commons, ca to Phoenix lake dam via the Natalie coffin park. Route builder will get you to Natalie coffin but any waypoint after that will make the entire route run around through fiarfax. A 5 mile detour, for a 200 yard hop.\n\nIt has become so unusable in our area that we are likely going to abandon, for mapmyride (which doesn't have these issues)",

      "# [Strava API Agreement Update by mcneese.chad on 2024-11-18](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/strava-api-agreement-update/98191)\nYou might’ve seen this from Strava in your email just now:\n\nㅤ\n\nWe’re reaching out to inform you of a change that affects how third-party apps connected to Strava may display certain information. This update, effective on November 11th, is part of our commitment to privacy and transparency across all connected apps and devices.\n\nㅤ\n\n…which includes this condition:\n\nData Use Limitations:\n\nWe’re updating our terms to explicitly prohibit third parties from using any data obtained via Strava’s API in artificial intelligence models or other similar applications.\n\nㅤ\n\nWhich platforms is that going to effect?\n\nReading between the lines … strava saying “it’s OUR data and we need to protect our most valuable asset”.\n\nThe only third party I share strava with is intervals.icu. But IMO would make sense to start sharing the primary source of data (garmin, wahoo, etc) with third parties rather than strava, even though strava is usually the easiest.\n\nI do this stuff for a living and hope this isn’t the start of a larger trend. Like I’m not going to be happy if Garmin pulls something like this. Unfortunately pervasive in my industry though (healthcare).\n\nIf that is indeed true I suppose I can always do:\n\nWahoo → TR and Zwift → TR (if that is indeed coming soon) for my indoor, unstructured rides.\n\nI understand why Strava is doing this but I feel like this could be the user’s choice on a third party integration basis.\n\nIt sure sounds like it, so I guess the best thing to do in this case is cut out the middleman and sync directly from Wahoo/Garmin to TrainerRoad (and intervals.icu) and… that pretty much kills my primary use case for Strava\n\nAlso, lol:\n\nNote: Per our Community Guidelines and Guidelines to Ideas, posts requesting or attempting to have Strava revert business decisions will not be permitted.\n\nOkay, then. I’ll vote with my wallet instead.\n\nIt is definitely rich that Strava has implemented AI itself using data ** checks notes ** obtained via third party APIs but is apparently forbidding the reciprocation.\n\nI am still in “benefit of the doubt” mode as I haven’t read the full legalese but lol.\n\nI do wonder if they are aware of this they will rightfully stay quiet for the time being. If they unsure what this means for their integration with Strava it is usually best in the company’s interest to stay quiet until they get full clarify on the legal implications, if any.\n\nThat is part of the reason I skipped a tag for now.\n\nBut if this is so far reaching, I would have hoped that Strava might give a heads up to those potentially affected 3rd parties. Or not… and they are blindsiding them the same us average people?\n\nIt sounds like a very strong move.\n\nThe sort of thing that only a company that is exceptionally confident of its position in the market would do.\n\nI wonder if Strava would be classed as a monopolist and, if so, if this would be an abuse of its market power?\n\nWe have the post above from David (Intervals.icu) and I saw another on Reddit where developers shared that they were notified by Strava earlier than we (the users) were.\n\nThanks for sharing the Intervals.icu update, as I had asked this exact question. I believe this change means coaches will no longer be able to view our activities on Intervals/TrainingPeaks. If that’s the case, the only use I have for Strava is the heat maps, and I’m sure not paying their annual rate for that.\n\nFor what it’s worth, I have an API application and only got the notice about the changes two hours ago. Granted, it’s a very small application so maybe I didn’t merit any more advance warning (the only user is me, I’m using the API to show my own data on my own website, which it seems I’m not allowed to do anymore )",
      "# [Get to Know a Skier’s Strava: John Steel Hagenbuch Goes Long. Very Long. on 2024-09-27](https://nordicinsights.news/2024/09/27/get-to-know-a-skiers-strava-john-steel-hagenbuch-goes-long-very-long/)\nBy Gavin Kentch\n\nWelcome back to “Get to know a skier’s Strava,” an occasional feature showcasing an athlete’s Strava account. Previously in this series: Federico Pellegrino, Michaela Keller-Miller, and Pål Golberg Eats Breakfast.\n\nThe mass of athletic men lead lives of quiet consistency, as I’m pretty sure Thoreau once said. There is no way to develop the aerobic capacity to succeed in this deeply demanding sport without a cumulative thousands of hours’ worth of easy distance under your belt; there is no way to reliably log, say, 800 hours of easy distance a year without being consistently conservative in your approach. Twenty weeks @ 40 hours apiece and forty weeks @ 20 hours both work out to the same total number of hours, but one of them is a great deal more likely to be sustainable in the long run.\n\nJohn Steel Hagenbuch is not most men, and he cares little for your physiological conservatism. Let’s take a look at his training for the week of September 2–8, 2024, humorously denominated on Strava as “Shrimp Week” for reasons that I am neither young nor hip enough to understand (yes I get that the leitmotif here is a movie that came out in 1994). Buckle up; what you are about to read may shock you.\n\nMonday morning: 50km rollerski\n\nAt 9:21 a.m. on Monday morning, Shrimp Week USA 🦐 2024 officially gets underway. John Steel Hagenbuch does a 50km rollerski, in 2:25. Impressive for many mortals, but likely not a huge physiological undertaking for Steel Hagenbuch, who V2s with a fluidity belying its grace and strength, and who logs 50km rollerskis far more frequently than your typical athlete.\n\nAverage HR here is 144, so overall this may be a moderate effort for someone with a MHR well over 190, though that figure hides some consistent periods of elevated HR over several climbs. The back roads of New Hampshire look somewhere between perfect and idyllic here; I am jealous.\n\nMonday afternoon: 49km rollerski\n\nWe’re already at 4:20 (lol) on Monday afternoon, and this is our first sign that this is not going to be a normal week. Steel Hagenbuch heads north this time, on a tridentine route into eastern Vermont, knocking out another 49 kilometers in just over three hours on his feet.\n\nOne of his videos embedded in this post captures a peaceful moment on an empty road. Dusk approaches. The world quiets; crickets are chirping. And still Steel Hagenbuch rolls on.\n\nIt is now Monday evening. The man has already logged a cool 99km, and 5:15 moving time, for the day. This is roughly equivalent to my highest *weekly* rollerski total from the past summer (I run a lot, okay).\n\nTuesday morning: 65km rollerski\n\nMonday evening’s workout concluded after 7 p.m., if you read elapsed time against starting time and do the math. Less than 14 hours later, Steel Hagenbuch is at it again. He goes north and east this time, out to Lyme, New Hampshire, and back. Detours slightly mid-roll to log a dozen repeats up a short climb. Picks up a KOM on a 118-meter hors catégorie climb earlier in the ski, ascending an eight-percent grade with his HR at a chill 153.\n\nAverage HR for this morning’s workout, in toto, is 123. Speaking of chill.\n\nTuesday afternoon: 45km rollerski\n\nTuesday afternoon, Steel Hagenbuch is back onto the rollerskis once more. Into Vermont this time, and “just” 45km this time, but also that’s still well over 100 kilometers of cumulative rollerskiing for the day.\n\nThe average HR for this session is 117, MHR a sedate 134. I’m going to have some pronounced “don’t try this at home, kids” cautions at the end of this article, but in all seriousness, if there is a broader takeaway from this profile that anyone can use, it’s that you really do have to ramp down the effort when you increase the volume. This week is just a memorably extreme exemplar of that moral.\n\nWednesday morning: 107km rollerski\n\nWednesday morning: for a change of pace, some rollerskiing.\n\nSteel Hagenbuch knocks out the century mark in one fell swoop this time, leaving the Dartmouth campus at 9:27 a.m., swinging by in the early afternoon for, I would hope, a whole lot of food, then heading out again for another 40+ kilometers after lunch.\n\nThe entire rollerski — 107 kilometers, 6+ hours — takes place over two large loops, with basically no overlap. I’m not sure there are 107 kilometers in the entire state of Alaska combined where I would feel comfortable rollerskiing on the roads like this… we do “rural” here, sure, but not so much “chill rural farm roads.” Or farms, for that matter. New England, man.\n\nIt is now Wednesday afternoon, less than halfway through the week. Steel Hagenbuch has already logged 316 kilometers’ worth of rollerskiing across 17.5 hours’ worth of training time. This would not be out of place as the cumulative rollerski training load for a top World Cup skier — which Steel Hagenbuch demonstrably is — for the entire week.\n\n(There’s a lot of different ways to get to 25–30 hours in a week, and individual athletes will adjust ratios for individual needs and capabilities, but 15+ hours of rollerskiing, 7–10 hours of foot or foot with poles, a couple hours for strength, and the rest on the bike or other training modalities would not surprise me in a high-end skier’s training log.)\n\nSteel Hagenbuch, for his part, has hit this mark by Wednesday afternoon.\n\nWednesday afternoon: 29-mile road bike ride\n\nSlightly less than one hour later, Steel Hagenbuch is back out the door on a Wednesday night group ride, his first non-rollerski training of the week. I’m glad he’s giving his upper body a rest, I guess?\n\nBut not so much his legs. Dude claims the KOM on a popular climb plus several other segment top-10s in the process; he is not going slowly out there. Though he does this all with a MHR of 175 and an average HR of 142, a difficult achievement for most people. But Steel Hagenbuch, if you had any doubt whatsoever remaining by this point, is not most people. (Is he even human? Discuss.)\n\nThursday morning: 60km rollerski\n\nThursday early afternoon: Track workout\n\nThursday evening: 40km rollerski\n\n“This is the most sicko double day of all time,” one admiring/appalled commenter had written on Strava of Wednesday’s exertions.\n\nIf you found Wednesday notable, and you probably should, then get ready for Thursday. The morning session brought another 60km of rollerskiing… early afternoon saw a track workout… and then the evening saw 40km more rollerskiing to hit an even 100km for the day. That is, combined, 100km and 5:38 of rollerskiing, plus another 48 minutes on foot. My goodness.\n\nBack to that track session for a second:\n\nThe morning’s rollerski workout commenced at 9:19 a.m. and had an elapsed time of 3:34 (against a moving time of 3:22; dude spent a whopping 12 minutes total stopped to eat, drink, or photograph in a 3.5-hour ski), so Steel Hagenbuch was on his feet on rollerskis until 12:53 p.m.\n\nA full 30 minutes later, at 1:23 p.m., a warmup run for a track session ensues. Assuming that it took, say, just five minutes total to remove and stow rollerski gear and put on running gear, that leaves 25 minutes’ worth of transition time. I hope that the intermezzo from ca. 12:56–1:21 p.m. was luxuriant. And filled with a lot of food, given the 60-kilometer rollerski just concluded.\n\n… but maybe not too much food, because now it was time for, I think, 8 x 400 on the track.\n\nAnd that’s still not all! A little less than three hours later, it was time for the final 40km of rollerskiing on the day. This bagatelle of a workout — at 40 kilometers it was the shortest rollerski of the week lol — commenced at 5:13 p.m., and saw our hero out on the roads until 7:48 p.m. Sunset in Hanover on September 5 was at 7:09 p.m., with civil twilight concluding at 7:37 p.m. Suffice to say that Steel Hagenbuch is not going gentle into that good night out there.\n\nFriday morning: 110-mile road bike ride\n\n110 miles, 7,200 feet, just under 6 hours on the bike. In the abstract, this is substantial, but not an atypical weekend long ride for a dedicated roadie. In practice… suffice to say that your typical weekend warrior road cyclist has not logged 416 kilometers of rollerskiing in the past four days as warmup.\n\nFriday afternoon: (nothing)\n\nAnd on the afternoon of the fifth day, John Steel Hagenbuch rested.\n\nSaturday: 145km rollerski\n\n“This activity is John Steel’s longest roller ski on Strava!” reads a cheerful badge accompanying this entry. Joyce’s longest sentence, Faulkner’s longest paragraph, and John Isner’s longest tennis match are all jealous.\n\nThis, for me, is where the entire enterprise shifts from the deeply impressive but still theoretically intelligible to the simply obscene. Over eight hours on rollerskis. Nearly 10 hours on his feet total elapsed time. In the rain. 561 kilometers of rollerskiing for the week.\n\nThis is beyond real. This is hyperreal. Move over, Disneyland; Baudrillard has new fodder for analysis here. I bet he was a huge nordic ski fan.\n\nSunday: 5.5-hour, 34-mile run\n\nAn easy five-and-a-half hours on his feet to finish things off. No big deal. Plus the week’s first and only photograph of an actual shrimp; I respect the extended buildup to this final sight gag.\n\nFor the week, that totals, per Strava, 45 hours of training time on the nose. 852km total distance, with 11,769 meters of elevation gain (that’s 529 miles and 38,600 feet in American). This is two weeks’ worth of training for some pro skiers. A month’s worth of training for an ambitious citizen racer. Six to even eight weeks’ worth of training for some midpack skiers. All in seven days.\n\nThese totals are, well, obscene, but are not too far outside the standard range for high-volume endurance sport athletes. I was going to write something like, “pro triathletes log 40-hour weeks pretty consistently,” but one Kristian Blummenfelt (2020 Olympic gold medalist) doesn’t have anything over 35 hours listed on his Strava from the last year, so, ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.\n\nTurning to speedskating, Nils van der Poel, who by any standard was an outlier, built an aerobic base off of 33 hours of largely stationary cycling within a week a five-day training week… but he also writes, “If I wanted to go for a trip with my friends Thursday–Sunday I would squeeze in 30 hours of training Monday–Wednesday and then have four days of no training.” van der Poel retired two years ago with world records and Olympic gold medals in both the 5,000m and 10,000m to his name, so the somewhat outré training distribution of 33 hours in five days — or even 30 hours in three days — seems to have worked for him.\n\nCloser to home, and back to this sport, Noah Hoffman stacked up 35-hour weeks pretty consistently during what I would describe as his infamous year of infamous hours, in which he increased his hours to a round 1,000, from something like 750 the season prior, in an attempt to become the fittest athlete in the men’s World Cup field.\n\nAnd while the precise training of the APU Elite Team is a state secret around these parts, it is safe to assume that multiple men in Anchorage logged at least 30 hours a week on several occasions this past summer. Indeed, here’s APU athlete Garrett Butts referring to “another 4 digit season of training in the log” for the 2022/2023 training year, and here he is earlier this month discussing “get[ting] dug out of a hole while training 27+ hours/week.” If you’re at a 1000+ hours for the season overall, and you have any degree of periodization for a several-month race season, simple math suggests that you’re going to be around 30 hours/week for much of the summer.\n\n… finally, Kílian Jornet seems to have logged 268 hours in one recent 19-day binge of linking up all 82 Alpine peaks over 4,000 meters under only human power — that’s roughly 14 hours a day, or 98 hours a week, for nearly three weeks straight. But his Strava for this, while perhaps the single most impressive Strava entry of all time, only mentions bike and feet, so Steel Hagenbuch still gets the nod here on rollerski time.\n\nIn conclusion, unless you are John Steel Hagenbuch or someone else of his ilk, you should not train this much volume. (And if you are that good a skier, there’s no way you’ll be taking training advice from me, anyway.) But no matter how long you’re going for, you should probably go easier than you think you need to, and eat more food than you think you need to, to help make it sustainable. I hear that shrimp are pretty nutrient-dense, and a good source of protein.\n\nYou’re reading this on Nordic Insights, one man’s labor of love dedicated to publicizing American nordic skiing. Last season’s GoFundMe is literally the only reason why I turned a profit in year one of Nordic Insights, and in turn the only reason why there is a year two of Nordic Insights for you to be reading now: I was okay with working for very little money to get this love letter to American cross-country skiing off the ground, but I didn’t want to lose money for the privilege of doing so. If you would like to support what remains a brutally shoestring operation, this season’s GoFundMe may be found here. Thank you for your consideration, and, especially, for reading.",

With the theme of Progress, Together company leaders announced how the platform will empower its global community to make progress in the way they explore, move, and connect on Strava.\n\n\"Strava is gaining momentum to realize our vision of a world connected through movement,\" said Michael Martin, chief executive officer of Strava. \"We are focused on two fundamental shifts to accelerate how we deliver value to 125 million people globally– building for women and leveraging Artificial Intelligence – which will unlock new community-and-partner-powered experiences across the platform.\"\n\nA New Era of Product Velocity\n\nStrava, with new leaders at the helm, is ushering in its next era of product velocity. The company listened closely to feedback from its global community and announced three of the most requested features coming to the platform by the end of the year.\n\nThe first of these updates, AI-enabled Leaderboard Integrity, will harness machine learning to automatically flag irregular, improbable, or impossible activities recorded to the platform. Trained by millions of activities, this feature allows all users on Strava to play fair and have more fun.\n\nAdditionally, the company announced a new Family Plan Subscription, the sister of the company's Student Plan. With Family Plan, it's easier to make a fitness commitment with your community by sharing an annual subscription with up to three other people – friends, family, or fitness family. Launching in select countries this summer, with plans to roll out globally by the end of the year, Strava's newest annual subscription option offers the best value for groups (up to four), with a discount off the regular subscription price for each member.\n\nStrava also implemented an updated design system, an initiative that is integral in driving a heightened pace of product innovation at the company. Through this work, Strava announced the launch of one of the company's most requested features, Dark mode. Dark mode will improve the in-app experience for all users, reducing eye strain and improving accessibility while they record activity or scroll through the feed. Athletes can expect a rollout later this summer with options to keep their mobile settings always dark, always light, or match their device settings.\n\nCompany leaders highlighted several other features and updates to current products like Flyover, with its next iteration offering an overlay with activity stats and off-platform sharing capabilities. The overlay is available today for Strava subscribers and an off-platform sharing option will be released later this year.\n\nBuild for Her, Build for Many\n\nStudies show that women of all ages participate in sports at a far lower rate than men, and overall, despite wanting to be active, find less time to dedicate to an active lifestyle. As the company continues on its mission to motivate people to live their best active lives, building for women on the platform will ultimately serve everyone in the Strava community. Several new features and initiatives were announced as a part of this strategic focus, which includes:\n\nNight Heatmaps: Night Heatmaps show only activities between sundown and sunrise – so athletes can get an idea of which roads, trails, and paths are well-trafficked after hours. Since Night Heatmaps filter for after-hours routes, it can be a helpful tool for female athletes training before sunrise and after sunset.\n\nQuick Edit: For active women, having control over what is shared with the Strava community that cheers them on - like what time a run is logged - is important. Quick Edit makes it easier to make the most common edits - like activity name, and privacy settings so you can hide your start time, your map, or other workout stats.\n\nStrive for More®: The company announced a new phase of its Strive for More® initiative, created in 2022 to promote and support women in movement and sport. Today, Strava unveiled an official partnership with media company TOGETHXR to encourage more women to watch - and play - women's sports. As part of the partnership, Strava will also donate $100,000 to the Alex Morgan Foundation, started by co-founder of TOGETHXR, Alex Morgan, to support their mission to help girls and women find confident paths forward in sports and life.\n\nAthlete Intelligence\n\nToday, Strava announced the start of an accelerated product roadmap, outlining how Strava will implement the latest technological enhancements in AI and machine learning, to transform the athlete experience.\n\nOne key advancement to the platform includes the company's latest development, Athlete Intelligence. Strava is introducing its beta AI-powered feature which turns each subscriber's training data into an easily digestible summary that contextualizes their accomplishments and fitness goals. Unlike other AI-powered training services, Strava connects with thousands of devices, wearables, and fitness apps, so an athlete's insights can consider their entire fitness story across multiple sports and modalities.\n\nThe features shared at Camp Strava will be released on a rolling basis through the end of the year.

I plan to make this change from the 1st of December.\n\nI know a lot of people use Strava to get activities from Zwift into Intervals.icu. The good news is that direct Intervals.icu Zwift integration (planned workouts and completed activities) is almost complete!\n\nIf you are coaching someone on Intervals.icu and they are using Strava then you need to get them to setup direct Intervals.icu integration as soon as possible.\n\nThis is what I received from Strava:\n\nIn our efforts to further fortify trust and safety within our community, developers will no longer be permitted to expose user data that is obtained via our API within their app to any party outside of that user.\n\nYour app has been identified as now being in conflict with the updated terms and in order for your application to be compliant, we ask that you:\n\nMake the necessary updates to your app with regards to your Strava integration such that any future Strava data is only accessible to the authenticated user who provides such data.\n\nUpdate the visibility of all historic Strava data within your application such that any data is only visible to the authenticated user who provided that data.\n\nNotify users of your application of such changes to the extent required by your Privacy Policy, our API Agreement, or applicable law.\n\nWe ask that you kindly make these updates within the next 30 days in order to be compliant with our updated terms.\n\nIn one sense, this is a step in the right direction from Strava, but true to their recent form, they have also gone several steps in the wrong direction at the same time. They don’t seem to be able to land in the happy middle these days.\n\nRight now it’s possible to see private Strava activities of my friends in Intervals, as in activities that they have set to fully private in Strava. This is not a good thing for a number of very obvious reasons.\n\nBut if Strava’s change here is only to protect users from their private activities being visible (and I doubt it is their sole intention), then the best course of action would be to not serve private activity data via API. Job done. They could, perhaps, require that users approve the sharing of private activity data when linking a 3rd party service to Strava or further break down the permissions structure. It’s common for users to select from several check boxes to customize the level of data sharing they approve when linking accounts.\n\nAlternately they could require the third party to not show private activities to anyone but the user, or even allow the user to toggle visibility of these activities to others in the 3rd party app ( though these 2 are much more work to enforce for Strava). A simple flag for activity visibility status in Strava would make quick work for all (this probably already exists).\n\nInstead, Strava is making a drastic change they know will significantly affect their users. While privacy & protection of their users might be their public explanation, you have to wonder if this isn’t just a justification for nerfing 3rd party app usefulness in an attempt to lock users into the Strava ecosystem, and try to sell more premium subscriptions. Maybe Strava wants to eventually launch a feature for coaches?\n\nStrava knows that their analysis, even for premium users, is pretty shallow and useless for serious athletes. Intervals is absolutely kicking the ass of everything else out there, which is why I’m more than happy to pay to support it and have zero desire to pay for Strava ever again. I can’t help but feel that Strava is feeling pressure to stop sharing data for free from their VC investors, and is taking the opportunity here to try and hurt the competition. Shades of Reddit nerfing their API…\n\nPretty draconian move by Strava, and a reminder that no one truly owns any data they share with a social media company. They can cut off your access whenever they please.",

      "# [Strava closes the gates to sharing fitness data with other apps](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42190341)\nUnless Strava is aiming to get a GDPR fine, users can probably still access their data. What Strava is shutting down isn't data access, but rather their method for accessing the data without user intervention.\n\nYou can download a data export and upload it to whatever service you wish. You're not necessarily entitled to make Strava do that data sharing for you, though.\n\nIt's still a pretty shitty move from Strava's side. I wonder what AI model they're training (or other companies were training) with the data now no longer easily accessible through the API.\n\n> rather their method for accessing the data without user intervention.\n\nNonsense. The user did intervene: with an OAuth 2 flow. The user doesn't intervene with every API call or database query a data export makes.\n\nWhat you're really getting at is \"the user can't authorize someone else to look at their data\". That's like a hospital saying your spouse can't get an update on your condition in the emergency room because you didn't hand the documents to them yourself.\n\nIt's certainly well within their right to change this rule and cut off API access, but I suspect a lot of people are going to tell them to go screw themselves.\n\nIs it just me, or does The Verge's headline seem a bit clickbaity and not reflective of the actual change?\n\n> \"Strava closes the gates to sharing fitness data with other apps\"\n\nThis doesn't seem to be the case, with the quote they cite:\n\nEffective November 11, the updated API agreement introduces three key changes that provide Strava users with greater control, security, and a consistent experience: Stronger Privacy Standards: Third-party apps may now only display a user’s Strava activity data to that specific user. Users will continue to have access to their personal Strava data across apps connected to our platform, though there may be differences in how this data appears. Data Use Limitations: Our terms now explicitly prohibit third parties from using any data obtained via Strava’s API in artificial intelligence models or similar applications. Protecting the Strava Experience: Additional terms have been added to protect Strava’s unique look and feel and functionality, helping users easily distinguish between Strava and third-party platforms.\n\nThe restrictions seem to be:\n\n- You can only show that user's data to that user.\n\n- You can't use user's data to train AI models.\n\nSo it seems that you can still share your data to other platforms.\n\nOr am I missing something?\n\n> Training AI Models:\n\n> We believe in the potential of AI to transform the athlete experience–whether it’s delivering more personalized insights to help you reach your goals, generating route or training recommendations, or countless other possibilities. But innovation in this space must be handled responsibly and with a firm focus on user control. As part of our generative AI features, we are committed to implementing thoughtful solutions that prioritize user control and the ability to opt out.\n\n> Third-party developers may not take such a deliberate approach to training AI models and as a result, we believe the best decision for the platform and for users is to prohibit the use of data extracted from Strava users in this manner.\n\nTranslation: 'We want to consume your data for AI and we don't want anyone else to consume your data with AI. AI for me, not for thee. We own you and your data.'\n\nObviously they're totally enlightened and don't fit into that secondary category, as judged by themselves, and thus they deserve an exception to the policy. It's just all their potential competitors who might act unethically. Trust them, they know what's best for you and are only harming you because they care for you.\n\nI would be worried about the continued preservation of my data in the hands of someone who abuses it and uses such archetypical abuser tropes to justify their abuse.",
      "# [Strava’s Big Changes Aim To Kill Off Apps by Ray Maker on 2024-11-19](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/11/stravas-changes-to-kill-off-apps.html)\nYesterday Strava sent out an e-mail to users, outlining a change that’s occurring almost immediately, regarding 3rd party apps and the way apps are allowed to access and process data from Strava. All of these changes impact what is known as the Strava API (Application Programming Interface). That’s the piece that lets your Garmin watch push your workout to Strava, and then lets an app like VeloViewer or others access your data.\n\nThere are countless apps that use Strava’s API, literally tens of thousands according to Strava. Some of these are tiny, some of them are massive. Virtually every company in the space uses Strava’s API, including Garmin, Wahoo, TrainerRoad, VeloViewer, Xert, and plenty more. It’s become the defacto data hub for millions of athletes, some 100m+ according to Strava’s press release.\n\nIn any event, the e-mail Strava sent out, as you can see below, is pretty bland, and doesn’t really get into things:\n\nInstead, you need to crack open the included link to start understanding the implications. All of which roughly boils down to two main items (but a bunch of smaller things), there’s three biggies:\n\n#1: “Third-party apps are no longer able to display your Strava activity data on their surfaces to other users.”\n\n#2: “We’re updating our terms to explicitly prohibit third parties from using any data obtained via Strava’s API in artificial intelligence models or other similar applications.”\n\n#3: “You may not process or disclose Strava Data…for the purposes of, including but not limited to, analytics, analyses…”\n\nThey also included language that apps are somehow not allowed to replicate Strava’s “distinctive look and feel”, which…ok. And more hilariously, they added that any users posting to their community hub forums that are “requesting or attempting to have Strava revert business decisions will not be permitted” and summarily deleted.\n\nSaid differently: Do not discuss the community things you don’t like in the community.\n\nBut again, the big three that matter here are:\n\n#1: Apps can’t show your data beyond yourself\n\n#2: Apps can’t use any “AI” whatsoever in their processing of your data\n\n#3: Apps can’t do any analytics or data processing of your data\n\nTo understand how ridiculous these are, let’s outline some real-world apps you’re probably familiar with.\n\nBreaking Coaching and Comparison Apps:\n\nThe first item (not showing data beyond yourself) immediately breaks almost all coaching apps that have connections to Strava. This includes apps like Final Surge, Xert, and Intervals.icu. These are apps that pull in your Strava data (as you requested) to analyze on your platform. For visual reference, this:\n\nNow you may be wondering why they don’t just go directly to Garmin, Wahoo, etc… That’d be more effective, right? And indeed it is, and most of these apps do. Except there are literally thousands of device manufacturers out there, and many of them only connect to Strava.\n\nTake for example the AmazFit T-Rex watch I’m testing right now. That doesn’t connect to Final Surge. Or Xert. Or TrainerRoad. Or much else. It does connect to Strava though, so, my data uploads to Strava and I’m done – off it goes to all my authorized apps. The same is true for the Google Pixel Watch. Or Samsung’s Galaxy watches. Below is a good example of how I can get all those data types into Strava.\n\nStrava benefits because they’ve become the defacto platform of choice for consumers. Companies benefit because they don’t need never-ending connections to platforms. And consumers benefit because everything ‘just works’. That’s the goal, right? Just working?\n\nWell, not anymore.\n\nWith this change, apps that do any sort of coaching on their platform are not allowed to show the end users data to their coach. The new API terms and conditions explicitly prohibit this:\n\n“you may not disclose such data to, or use it for, another user nor any other third party.”\n\nIn fact, the popular training and coaching platform Intervals.icu already posted this breaks all coaching features for them related to Strava data – requiring them to hide not only new user data going forward, but all historical data for coaches.\n\n“Activities from Strava will soon only be visible to the athlete that performed the activity, not to their coaches or followers. This is a new addition to the Strava API terms and conditions.”\n\nBut it also breaks plenty of other apps that aren’t coaching apps – but merely showing Strava data. For example, apps like VeloViewer, which curates your lists of segments for deeper analytics and competition among groups, breaks. Same goes for all of their leaderboards for Zwift. Or their challenges. Or the listing of other people’s efforts (when you click on ‘View on Veloviewer’ from any of these below. All of it – going to be killed off if apps follow the letter of the law.\n\nLike these details:\n\nThe challenge with these changes, is that practically speaking, unless you have a Garmin or other big-name device with a proper and well-documented public and easy to access API, all of these apps won’t set up connections to those device platforms directly. They can’t in some cases, and it won’t be feasible in most to service all of these app requests. Even seemingly big players like Wahoo, Hammerhead/SRAM, and Polar don’t have easily accessible APIs that scale well to the number of requests that are going to be required here.\n\nNo Analysis of Data Apps:\n\nBut wait, there’s more. Strava’s new API agreement also makes clear that you can’t do ‘year in review’ type summaries either. In fact, it actually says you can’t do any analytics or processing of the data:\n\n“You may not process or disclose Strava Data, even publically viewable Strava Data, including in an aggregated or de-identified manner, for the purposes of, including but not limited to, analytics, analyses, customer insights generation, and products or services improvements. Strava Data may not be combined with other customer data, for these or any other purposes.\n\nIn fact, as one major app pointed out to me, the above paragraph basically says you can’t do anything with any data at all. While portions of the above entry existed in previous API versions, this paragraph has now been expanded to be more precise.\n\nWith the above line, you can’t do much of anything. You want to show a user how many miles they ran that week? Nope, not according to the letter of the law as that’s ‘processing’ for the purposes of ‘analytics’. You want to show them how hard their workout was compared to a year ago? Nope, can’t do that either, that’s ‘processing’ for the purposes of ‘analysis’. Want to create a heat map tile like VeloViewer has? Nope, that’s “aggregated” data for “insights generation”:\n\nWhile Strava lawyers might try and say perhaps that line is there to prevent something else, any non-lawyer or lawyer would argue the opposite in court if they had to. That single paragraph basically says apps can’t do anything at all. Period.\n\nThe problem here is that Strava’s API terms are so broad and wonky now, that the API no longer serves a purpose, as stated by the above paragraph.\n\nNonetheless, I went back to Strava and asked them questions about many of these topics, trying to get clarification to see if this was a misunderstanding, they completely ignored the questions I had, and responded with:\n\n“These changes were implemented to provide additional safeguards around our community’s data and to help ensure that a user’s Strava data can only be viewed by others on third-party apps in limited scenarios where sharing is both transparent and central to the functionality of the app. We recognize this is a change and are committed to working closely with partners during this transition.”\n\nPoint being, I gave them an opportunity to clarify things or set the record straight, and they said ‘nah’.\n\nAdd to that, they don’t seem all that committed to “working closely with partners”. As every single partner I’ve talked to over the last 24 hours has been completely broadsided by this change. They all received a generic e-mail Friday night, with a mere 30 days of notice to completely re-work their entire applications. Mind you, a 30-day period that includes the holidays (most companies would give at least 6 months of notice for something like this).\n\nI suspect we’ll see a lot of companies just shut off the API entirely, and perhaps that’s Strava’s goal. Though, I fail to see how that benefits paying Strava subscribers, and thus Strava’s bottom line. Strava seems to be working very hard to kill off the community of tens of thousands of apps that arguably made it so popular.\n\nNo AI Usage & Analytics:\n\nThe next issue is just as crazy as the the others. It says that 3rd party apps may not use artificial intelligence processing in any way, for your data coming from Strava. Specifically, it stays the following:\n\n“You may not use the Strava API Materials (including Strava Data), directly or indirectly, for any model training related to artificial intelligence, machine learning or similar applications.”\n\nOf course, the term “machine learning or similar applications” basically means “you may not do any processing at all” on it, especially when combined with the above ‘no analytics’ clauses.\n\nThis particular line item immediately kills apps like TrainerRoad and Xert using data from Strava, but also countless other apps that pull in your own workout data via Strava, and then use some sort of processing to analyze it. Machine learning is hardly new or fancy. And putting in there “similar applications”, what on earth does that mean?\n\nTrainerRoad and others use “AI” (however they want to define it), according to their marketing, and thus, in less than 30 days, they’ll have to cease their entire platform, or, disconnect Strava.\n\nIn the case of platforms like TrainerRoad, I suspect they’ll simply disable Strava altogether, and force everyone through direct connections. This will be fine for Garmin users, but as of right now there’s no inbound connection for Wahoo users (though that’s coming). And for people pushing Zwift workouts to TrainerRoad, that too will break until TrainerRoad completes their API connection in January.\n\nBut that won’t solve the larger issue TrainerRoad and other companies face, which is having to pull in the other 3rd party workout data types. TrainerRoad doesn’t have a connection to Suunto. Or Polar. Or AmazFit. Or Google. Or Fitbit. Or…I could do this all day. Strava solved that, to the benefit of both consumers and all companies involved.\n\nNow Strava seems to want to own the “AI space” with its always-helpful AI insights that simply re-word my activity titles and tell me something vaguely positive but usually wrong.\n\nAfter publishing this post and video, Strava has issued an update in response. Note, they didn’t reach out or respond to me with the text, but did respond to The Verge where the updated text was originally issued, before publishing it on Strava’s own newsroom site. The Verge e-mailed me the update with permission to use, prior to Strava’s posting. Here’s the full text of the update:\n\nUpdated on Nov. 19\n\nWe wanted to provide some additional context around the changes to our API Agreement and the impact for our users and developers. We currently anticipate these changes will impact less than .1% of applications and proactively notified the majority of those affected last week.\n\nEnhanced Privacy and User Control\n\nPrivacy and user control are at the forefront of our platform. As a result, we are committed to evolving our API practices as regulatory requirements and user expectations shift. This includes the decision to limit the ability of a user’s data to be displayed by third-party apps in ways the user may not expect. Specifically, we want to thoughtfully address situations where users connect to a third-party app and are unaware that their data is being surfaced not just for their own use and visibility, but also to other users (for example, in a public feed or heatmap). The latest API changes address this scenario and provide a more consistent framework for Strava user data.\n\nTraining AI Models\n\nWe believe in the potential of AI to transform the athlete experience–whether it’s delivering more personalized insights to help you reach your goals, generating route or training recommendations, or countless other possibilities. But innovation in this space must be handled responsibly and with a firm focus on user control. As part of our generative AI features, we are committed to implementing thoughtful solutions that prioritize user control and the ability to opt out.\n\nThird-party developers may not take such a deliberate approach to training AI models and as a result, we believe the best decision for the platform and for users is to prohibit the use of data extracted from Strava users in this manner. Our previous terms already disallowed the use of Strava user data in model training and development but we’ve made this more explicit in light of the increasing activity in this space.\n\nNo Impact to Most Developers\n\nWe recognize that our platform thrives because of the creativity and dedication of third-party developers who build tools to complement and extend Strava’s capabilities. We are steadfast in our commitment to fostering this ecosystem. We anticipate that these changes will affect only a small fraction (less than .1%) of the applications on the Strava platform–the overwhelming majority of existing use cases are still allowed, including coaching platforms focused on providing feedback to users and tools that help users understand their data and performance.\n\nCollectively, these changes reflect our commitment to ensuring that Strava remains a trusted platform for athletes and developers alike. That means holding ourselves—and anyone building on our platform—to high standards.\n\nHowever, ultimately, it doesn’t actually change things – in fact, kinda doubles down on it. In it, Strava basically says three things:\n\nA) 3rd party apps can’t show data beyond the user itself. Just as before, this still breaks coaching apps. Strava tries to confuse people by saying “the overwhelming majority of existing use cases are still allowed, including coaching platforms focused on providing feedback to users and tools that help users understand their data and performance.” – however, what they’re actually saying is 3rd party coaching apps can provide feedback, as long as that’s computational feedback. Coaching apps still cannot let human coaches see the data. Had that been the case, Strava would have simply said that, and notified coaching apps. They’ve done neither, and multiple coaching apps I’ve talked to have confirmed Strava hasn’t changed their position, but has scheduled meetings to talk about the impacts.\n\nB) Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is still prohibited. Again, Strava tries to keep distracting people by saying “training models” is not permitted. Yet the terms are very clear, both training and usage isn’t permitted. Still, as any company can tell you, even if it were just training (which again, it isn’t), these models can’t get better without training on the same data for whatever application purpose they are using. After all, last I checked, Strava themselves doesn’t give us permission to allow/deny their access to our data for AI training purposes.\n\nC) “No impact to most developers” – In the update, they say “We anticipate that these changes will affect only a small fraction (less than .1%) of the applications on the Strava platform”. Except, that’s the most disingenuous way of writing it. Strava has tens of thousands of connected applications, the vast majority of which are tiny hobbyist applications that may have 1 user or a handful of users. Instead, it’s the big-ticket applications that matter here with the most users. Strava isn’t saying 0.1% of users, just 0.1% of applications.\n\n–\n\nUltimately, it seems like Strava’s API itself needs an update if Strava believes users need more control. And to be clear – I’m 100% behind giving users more control. Strava could easily add check-boxes for “AI data usage” and “Show data publically” to the 3rd party platform API authentication dialog (just like they do today for other features). They could easily require 3rd party developers to ensure consent (just like they do today for other features). And they could easily require developers to adhere to various rules (just like they do today).\n\nGoing Forward:\n\nBased on these API terms changes, I don’t see how any apps can leverage Strava data going forward. Especially with the specific line item of “You may not process or disclose Strava Data, even publicly viewable Strava Data, including in an aggregated or de-identified manner, for the purposes of, including but not limited to, analytics, analyses, customer insights generation, and products or services improvements.” – that’s fundamentally what any app does: It processes your Strava data and provides some sort of analytics.\n\nPerhaps Strava will try and argue otherwise. In fact, I e-mailed them last night asking them to clarify these very questions, since these seemed pretty broad and impactful. The response was nothing more than sending me to the already-existing page about the API updates.\n\nI feel at times that Strava wakes up each morning, heads to work, looks out over the San Francisco Bay from their offices, and asks itself: How can we anger our users and partners today? How can we make everyone’s life more difficult today?\n\nEvery time Strava does something good (such as last week’s night heat maps), they immediately go and ruin that good love with something to upset their user base. And obviously, that’s their prerogative as a company. But it just seems that no company in the sports tech space spends as much time and energy proactively trying to anger their users as Strava does.\n\nI go back to Strava’s new CEO in his keynote address at Camp Strava this past summer (7:22 in video), where he said:\n\n“If you envision the whole active community, along with the connected fitness industry as sorta like one giant cycling peloton…then Strava should be leading the way. We should be your lead-out rider, blocking the wind, creating a slip-stream, helping the whole peloton move faster, and more efficiently.”\n\nI’m unclear on how these changes fit with that recently announced vision.\n\nUltimately, I use and significantly enjoy the core of Strava as much as most other people. I’m on the platform daily. But man…c’mon Strava, just do better.\n\nFOUND THIS POST USEFUL? SUPPORT THE SITE!\n\nHopefully, you found this post useful.

The primary reason we implemented the Strava integration is to provide a solution for Athletes whose wearables, including Garmin and others, do not sync directly with Freeletics via Google or Apple health integrations.\n\nBy using Strava as a point of connection, we enable many Athletes to connect their activities, even if their specific wearables are not supported. This approach allows us to support a broader range of devices, including also WHOOP and FitBit, through one platform and integration.\n\nThank you for sharing your question!\n\nHey Sylvain,\n\nthanks for the explanation! i think alot of the strava users are glad to have the feature.\n\nAlso most strava users are using a smartwatch to track - wouldn´t it be nice to have a smartphone/Garmin/Polar/etc. App to track the workouts? And also have a direct connection to Garmin Connect for example? - That would make everything so much easier\n\nBR Dominic\n\nHi Freeletics team!\n\nSo I have strava and Garmin. If I have garming connect connected to strava, the activity appears in strava too. So now with this feature I will get the activity from my garming to freeletics finaly automaticaly?\n\nSo far i had to cheat and write to goggle fit an activity, but i am new, and one day and many will forget.\n\nI am really happy that Strava now links with this as it allows me to keep my consistency rating high when I do things like swap out a gym session for a long uphill hike.\n\nThe only issue I am having is that when I use the app for a session, also tracking it on my Garmin, it ends up double loading.\n\nI will have strength training x2 and I am unsure how I can delete one of these logs."
