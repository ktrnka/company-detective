So what exactly do they do? I even sat down for a sales call and I'll be honest I still don't get it.\n\nI know they are universally loved pretty much, and I want to deploy them and have them as a partner!\n\n## Comment ID hybrw74 with +51 score by [(andrew-huntress, Reddit, 2022-02-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/t0msza/what_exactly_is_huntress/hybrw74/) (in reply to ID t0msza):\nThanks for tagging me /u/Quadling - I saw this thread earlier and was surprised to see how much attention it got. I typically prefer to let the community run with discussions like this but am happy to share my thoughts when asked!\n\nAs many correctly stated, the core of the Huntress service had always been footholds, or persistence. /u/computerguy0-0 did a great job in explaining how our service fit into the \"detect\" category of the NIST framework. [We played here exclusively for quite some time](https://i.imgur.com/VeW6WFK.png) and built our reputation by being the absolute best at detect and respond. \n\nIn [the last 24 months](https://i.imgur.com/tCfq9x5.png), we've added [Assisted Remediation](https://support.huntress.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404005119251-Understanding-Huntress-Incidents#Remediation), [Ransomware Canaries](https://support.huntress.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404005090067-Ransomware-Canaries), [External Recon](https://support.huntress.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404012768147-External-Recon), [Managed Windows Defender](https://support.huntress.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404005212691-Managed-Microsoft-Defender-Antivirus-Overview), [Host Isolation](https://support.huntress.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404960349459-Host-Isolation-Beta-) and have expanded our team globally to provide true 24/7 threat hunting.\n\nIn May of 2021, [we raised $40 million](https://www.huntress.com/blog/huntress-series-b-our-next-chapter-of-growth) in **minority VC investment** (no PE shenanigans here) with the intent of [going beyond detect and respond](https://i.imgur.com/ZDq8AYk.png). \n\nWe [acquired a company and their EDR technology](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/kvui00/huntress_acquires_networkaware_edr_technology/) around the same time and spent the last year rebuilding this from *the ground up* getting ready to introduce this functionality to our partners. This EDR functionality release was a [hot topic a few weeks ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/sjhld7/huntress_managed_av/) and for those of you who don't want to check out that thread, it will begin rolling out to partners starting on 4/1. \n\nWe have a ton more on the roadmap both for the rest of 2022 and 2023 and I believe we'll be doing a townhall style webinar in mid April to share those plans with the world.

They have partnered with MSP's, and they seem genuinely interested in helping MSP's and their clients be more secure. Usually during a zero-day, or large scale breach, you will find Kyle/Huntress leading the charge with forensics, information, and remediation.\n\nWe had a ransomware event a few years ago at a client and Huntress was on the phone with us, coaching and giving good advice, from square one.

Usually services, scheduled tasks or other junk usually left behind after malware is cleaned up or before malware is deployed during a breach.

Threatlocker is application whitelisting. It fits in with \"Protect\".  \n  \nHuntress fits in with \"Detect\".  \n  \nhttps://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/five-functions  \n  \nHuntress is there to see someone gaining permanent access, \"a foothold\", to a computer. There are only so many ways to establish a foothold and Huntress covers all of them on a Windows OS. This is backed by the human element.  \n  \nThe appeal of the product is quick identification. You want to catch the bad guys getting in as soon as possible so you can stop them as early as possible to minimize damage.  \n  \nYES, other products such as S1 do detect persistence, Huntress cleans up a lot of the noise that other products typically make to only actionable events, again, sometimes reviewed by a human in a timely manor. Plus, for big events, Huntress actually gives a damn and calls their partners.  \n  \nI heard from TWO companies during the Kaseya breach, Huntress and Blackpoint. I wasn't even a partner at Huntress yet. I am now a partner of both and deploy both to various customers at my MSP. It's well worth having them on my side when something inevitably goes wrong.",

Huntress doesn't really have visibility beyond endpoints today. This limited scope does create some blind spots and potential risks.  \n\n\nThey also don't really offer the ability to choose the vendor of your choice.

A very unique and important one.\n\nFor context, we run three EDR platforms on our managed endpoints. About a year ago we hired a penetration testing firm and had them run an assumed breach scenario to test our endpoint security. They had physical access to the machine and a user login. Halfway through the test period, we upgraded this to local admin account.\n\nWindows Defender is turned on with Defender for Endpoint P1 via M365 Business Premium license. For this test it was out of the box configuration on Microsoft's end, running recommended settings from Huntress. This was the first layer of defense and did well in blocking initial access attempts. Huntress caught and recorded, but did not alert on, the blocked attempts (this is intentional, thier systems are tuned to alert on active, live threats not blocked ones).\n\nTodyl EDR (custom, highly tuned Elastic/Endgame engine) kicked in as the second layer. Thier SOC alerted to the threatening activity and isolated the endpoint within 10 minutes. As a result of this testing, they now pull in and analyze alerts from Defender as well. \n\nHuntress is the backstop. The supporting and most important layer, in my opinion. Thier systems and SOC detect, alert and action on threats that have bypasses every other platform. Because they use whitelist-based methodology for persistent activity, they will catch those sneaky, manual attacks that slip by everyone else. For us, when Huntress alerts, it's an immediate all hands on deck, red alert, defcon 1 scenario. It means something is active on the system and has bypassed the blocking layers.\n\nHuntress can absolutely run standalone on a system alongside Defender and do a phenomenal job. They will catch all the bad things. That said, they are also not a full SOC/SIEM solution. If detailed or customized alerting is important, you should have additional defensive layers in place. This could be SentinelOne, Todyl, Crowdstrike, etc.\n\nThis doesn't even begin to touch the Huntress contributions to this community. They are always on top of the latest threats and actively hunting them across every endpoint. If something big is going down, your first notification will be from Huntress.

Since deploying, they have found a few minor incidents that required remediation and in each case provided a good explanation for what happened as well as steps to correct the issue.  The automated remediation is awesome but if you want to do things manually they provide steps to do that.\n\nMost recently, they were front and center working on the 3CX breach.  I had some machines with the vulnerable application installed.  I was notified of each impacted machine before any damage was done and I was able to quickly respond with removal scripts to eliminate the vulnerable software.  On top of that, my account rep reached out to me to make sure I was aware of the 3CX incident.\n\nOn the business side they have been great to deal with.  A few months ago my account rep reached out to me to offer a different tier, not advertised on the website, that was able to save me money.  After finding out that they can now bill in Canadian currency she worked diligently to revise my agreement which is also saving me money and making my costs predictable.\n\nPrior to using Huntress I was running S1, and it's a great product.  I have since fully migrated to Huntress with managed Defender and have had no regrets.  Knowing there is a competent team behind me helps me sleep at night.  I'm a small, one man MSP with around 200 endpoints but I've always felt like I'm just as important to them as any large customer.

The team there is one of the best (if not THE best) at what they do, and gives back to the security community in a huge way. They are absolute experts. Full stop.\n\nNow that being said, if you're happy with S1 and feel comfortable managing it on your own, probably not a lot to gain there. Where Huntress shines is managing it for you. They become your SOC and save you from needing to be an expert. It's a good product and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.\n\n### Comment ID jf3go3t with +33 score by [(andrew-huntress, Reddit, 2023-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/12cunua/huntress_worth_the_money/jf3go3t/) (in reply to ID jf3fsru):\nthis is the answer\n\n### Comment ID jf40ujw with +11 score by [(sheps, Reddit, 2023-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/12cunua/huntress_worth_the_money/jf40ujw/) (in reply to ID jf3fsru):\n100% this.

I feel really comfortable with both S1 and Huntress on machines.  I understand there is an additional cost with these though.\n\nAnother major thing to consider, like others have mentioned, is the incredible resource Huntress is for the entire community.  They do regular webinars with engineers which are a great resource to get on the pulse of what they are seeing.  And the response to pretty much every major incident over the last few years has been spearheaded by Huntress with real world data, expert advice, and remediations (which sometimes will be pushed automatically by them).  Your money and endpoints help keep that going.\n\nI feel like a Huntress evangelist or shill, but we are so lucky to have such an open, useful resource.\n\n### Comment ID jfapua4 with +1 score by [(Truman_IRL, Reddit, 2023-04-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/12cunua/huntress_worth_the_money/jfapua4/) (in reply to ID jf3na0t):\nWe just made the switch from S1 to Huntress and I agree they’re absolutely amazing.

You will not find a product that can perform how Huntress performs at anywhere near the price. In addition to its standalone capabilities, the ability to manage Defender is the cherry on top.  Easy deployment and ticketing integration makes it very set and forget.\n\nAlso included is External Recon. It uses Shodan to port scan every public IP an agent beacons from. This was an easy way for me to audit our clients to ensure that only required ports are exposed.\n\nMy only caveats..\n\nYou have to remember to manually map any new clients to the corresponding client in PSA.\n\nSeems easy to defeat (no anti-tamper) but no one is targeting it. By the time I ran a NLTEST and pinged a DC from a Huntress protected box, Huntress fired a ticket into PSA.\n\nIt provides a nice indicator of what machines Defender agents are borked on but fixing these is time-consuming---but this is more of a Defender issue.\n\nAs a co-managed SOC platform, Huntress' only action is host-isolate.. but in those critical instances.. it totally works. Ticket fires into PSA and you are getting a phone call from a Huntress engineer stepping you through what actions to take. \n\nAgain there are other more expensive SOC platforms out there that can take more actions but if you are doing a standard offering for your clients and an elevated security offering, Huntress fits right into that price/performance bracket for a standard offering.\n\n### Comment ID kpidiw1 with +2 score by [(hirs0009, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/12cunua/huntress_worth_the_money/kpidiw1/) (in reply to ID jf8wuqo):\nI just sat through a sale presentation and honestly it looks like the product is kind of a half measure with many holes.

It turns out that we had a bug that caused the events not to match the detectors, so we were not able to report on malicious inbox rules that existed before we were deployed and started to receive the Microsoft 365 events from the audit log.\"*\n2. \"*We found that in some cases, we were missing detections because the maximum number of hits an Elasticsearch rule was able to have was 100. This meant that if there were too many matches in a short time period, not all matches would be returned. This one was not obvious, because you don't know what you don't know, but we identified some events that we thought should have generated signals and did not and we've seen this issue with Elasticsearch before.\"*\n3. **Feel like these should have been baked in already.** *\"I don't know how helpful listing the new detectors we're adding will be, but we've gotten a decent number of requests from folks to help them understand what types of things we're detecting, so here are a few new detectors we shipped:*\r  \n*Login from VPN*\r  \n*Login from proxy*\r  \n*Login from brute force IP*\r  \n*Login from TOR*\r  \n*Login from new region*\r  \n*Login from RDP\"*\n\n## Comment ID kd2kjmo with +31 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd2kjmo/) (in reply to ID 18gptkf):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID kd48s68 with +6 score by [(glibbertarian, Reddit, 2023-12-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd48s68/) (in reply to ID kd2kjmo):\nThey have VC money that needs to see a return.\n\n#### Comment ID kd4zqbc with +3 score by [(cablemps, Reddit, 2023-12-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd4zqbc/) (in reply to ID kd48s68):\nReally?

The fact that we were only seeing the first 100 matches for a detector wasn't obvious and didn't trigger until we started to bring on more partners to where we would have that many hits. We would have had a better chance of detecting this if we had built in more observability from the beginning, but it's always a tradeoff. Spending a lot of time on observability and ignoring features and onboarding customers doesn't get you much. It's about balancing the two. We're spending more time on observability stuff now to make sure we can identify any regressions in the future.\n\nWe would have liked to have some of these baked in from the beginning, but for most of these to work we had to build in the additional context and ingest data from third-party sources where they are the experts. To know if a user is logging in from a new location requires you to store and query all of the prior locations for the user, which we had to build out. Unlike other services, we didn't want our partners to have to go in and specify which countries or regions were allowed for thousands of M365 users. That's untenable. Other vendor solutions have hard-coded rules for things like M365 users outside of the U.S., which is also not going to work for a lot of folks. It took a bit of time to build these.\n\n### Comment ID kd2mozj with +4 score by [(evilmuffin99, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd2mozj/) (in reply to ID kd2fb4n):\nSome of that does make sense.

Usually this comes in the form of detections. If we feel that it can detect malicious activity, we want to get it in peoples hands so they can start using it and we can capture more data and with more data we can improve the detection capabilities.\n\nIn this case we were detecting things and sending incident reports and customers were largely happy. In cases where we had missed things during the beta we had adjusted and felt that we were now detecting those things. What surprised us was when we opened it up to general availability and started on-boarding more partners we found that with a larger sample size we had more things that we missed and we didn't iterate as fast as we should have on those to close those gaps.\n\nSo we felt like releasing this was going to help our partners find malicious activity within their M365 tenants, and that's why we moved forward with it.\n\n#### Comment ID kd4bqmt with +2 score by [(mpethe, Reddit, 2023-12-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd4bqmt/) (in reply to ID kd2mozj):\nI was definitely given the impression when I demo'd it that it was going to detect impossible travel type logins.

We were looking for evidence of threat actors accessing potential unencrypted credentials and stumbled across the security risk.\n\nOne important distinction - we didn’t scan or download any of these files. We monitor process events via our EDR and saw that a file that looked like a password-containing file was accessed by a user. We didn’t use anything special, purely just looking at files being accessed with password in the name.\n\nEdit 2: We appreciate the feedback! We have some ideas on what we would do differently next time around re: notifications. If you need a CSV of these incidents or want help closing them in bulk reach out to support or your account manager!\n\n### Comment ID k3do1zb with +19 score by [(recover82, Reddit, 2023-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/16zanc5/huntress_low_incident_about_files_that_contain/k3do1zb/) (in reply to ID k3dnnxr):\nOh wow!

For clients who are more security conscious and want 24/7 monitoring we have a bundle of tools that includes Huntress in addition to our standard SentinelOne client. \n\nHuntress is a great product, but if you watch your SentinelOne deployment closely you are likely to catch most things before Huntress alerts. That said, Huntress writes great reports on findings, offers a basic attack surface monitoring page, and all around provides a great value MDR product for your customers even when you are using SentinelOne. \n\nIf your clients have compliance / SIEM requirements, you may need to find a SIEM product to either layer in there or replace Huntress with. However, I still like Huntress because they tend to be much more nimble at detecting emerging threats but SIEMs have long term logs so that you can review IOCs long after the fact.\n\n### Comment ID jfbzbma with +1 score by [(Lurking_is_Best, Reddit, 2023-04-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/12elzn8/another_huntress_post_multiple_endpoint_security/jfbzbma/) (in reply to ID jfbyb1v):\nThanks, that's a really insightful reply.

      "# Post ID 1atjpws: Blackpoint Cyber - Huntress with +36 score by [(cassini12, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/)\nHi,\n\n So quick note I have been a fan of Huntress for quite some time so this is not in anyway a rant. We just had an occurrence the other day and the way it was handled was not what I was expecting (probably my fault) or one that i cared for. Good news, nothing happened and we were working at 6am when the alert came thru so we disabled the M365 account in question and did our due diligence. Anyways,  \n\n So I am looking for some other MSPs advice on utilizing BlackPoint Cyber with Cloud Response as opposed to Huntress.  The example below is why I am looking for our firm and trying to decide if its the best solution for all of our clients. \n\n6:03am EST, Huntress alert via email regarding an M365 account the was logged into successfully from another country and also using an Express VPN client.  This firm in particular uses M365 accounts to access their companies data shares so this was a high potential for disaster.\n\n Account was not auto disabled , just this alert.  This alone did not sit well with me. In the overall scheme, if 3000 users are working fine and just 1 user gets locked out of their account as a security measure, then all is well in the world ... to just alert us via email simply reminded me exactly of the commercial on TV were a bank is being robbed and the security guard tells the customer \"Oh the bank is being robbed\" and the customer says \" Then stop them, do something\" in which he replies \" Oh no, I don't actually DO anything, I just tell you your being robbed\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n So fast forward to now and I see BP Cyber in Pax8, Read about it, demo it and it seems to be great BUT a demo means nothing when it comes to security I really just want to get some others input on utilizing BP with S1 over Huntress with S1and if you have done this how has the SOC been and do they seem very interactive?  I can say I love the random email alerts just letting us know about \"user X logged in from Y or User X changed a rule\" etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, I actually like Huntress a lot, they have some great communities and employees. I just need to know I can go to bed and if something happens at 3am I can deal with a locked account in the morning instead of a malware attack.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nthanks for your input!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Comment ID kqzfi1d with +29 score by [(giantsnyy1, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqzfi1d/) (in reply to ID 1atjpws):\nSo I actually had this happen to me with Blackpoint.

I'm the director of the SOC at Huntress. Feedback like this is helping us iterate aggressively on our approach and feature development. As of this past Friday, we are now using our new identity baselining technology to lay the ban hammer on certain M365 logins.\n\nWith this new tech, we consider accounts with at least 30 days of activity as \"***baselined***\". If we see a *baselined* account use a VPN provider for the first time, we send a ***Critical report, isolate the account, and kill the user sessions.***\n\nFor identities that don't yet have 30 days of data, we send a High report and do not isolate the account. This prevents a scenario where you deploy Huntress to an org using VPNs widely and  they all lose access to M365 until the MSP can respond.\n\nKeep in mind, should an attacker log into an un-baselined account from a VPN and trip any one of our additional detections for likely business email compromise/M365 attacker tradecraft, we'll immediately send a critical report and **isolate the account at that point.** We try to have multiple places in the attacker lifecycle to catch the attacker.  \n\\---  \nThings on our mind:\n\n* Consider reducing the baseline time from 30 days to 7 days.\n* Engage with partners to understand if they'd still prefer new identities to be isolated as well.\n\nHere is a [post from the other side of this debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1al67bw/huntress_new_m365_ip_detections_for_vpns_and/) earlier this month. It's a challenging balance but we're all in on creating innovative ways to solve it.\n\n**I can confidently say you have our ear** and we're having these exact conversations internally every week. We're iterating quickly based on real MSP feedback. If you're open to it, shoot me an email with your MSP name and I'll review this incident in depth to see if recent/upcoming changes would have modified the outcome here: [max.rogers@huntresslabs.com](mailto:max.rogers@huntresslabs.com)\n\n### Comment ID kqzmp1k with +11 score by [(RaNdomMSPPro, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqzmp1k/) (in reply to ID kqyhu20):\nThanks for weighing in. We’d like to see the option to just block any login activities from a vpn, per client would be ideal. I know you’re working towards more automated remediation vs. alert and the msp handles (problematic if you don’t staff 24x7) it’s generally ok to isolate and let us pickup the pieces, better than the alternative. Also, and I've suggested to huntress, incorporate the huntress agent presence as an extra trust check for customers using huntress edr too. Or integrate with common rmms for same effect to better evaluate things. Once you guys add some ms365 posture management capabilities (just buy Simeon cloud) you’ll be leading instead of following on the cloud mdr front.  \n\nThe comparison between huntress and BlackPoint isn’t exactly fair - to use BP cloud mdr, you’re already on their MDR and SOC services, in essence you’re already paying for the SOC team to manage 365 events too. BP has some of the same limitations tho, they have a top 30 (or whatever it is now) events they detect and respond to. A starting point that will no doubt improve. Posture management is just ok unless there has need a major innovation recently.\n\nEither vendor is a good decision, but one is about 4x the cost, so keep that in mind.\nedits to fix spelling.\n\n### Comment ID kr00vac with +4 score by [(Crshjnke, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kr00vac/) (in reply to ID kqyhu20):\nOr why not let the client pick what happens with high alerts per customer?

Huntress has had an amazing reputation as a company around here for a while. And it’s clear you guys have a no BS approach to business. But when you guys started taking PE/VC money the community voiced concerns that product quality would drop in the forced pursuit of revenue. And then the M365 product was pushed out the door and AMs started pushing it hard to partners, and over the last 6 months it’s become apparent that the product was not finished and still isn’t finished, its lead to a false sense of security. It seems reasonable to conclude the product launch was rushed to chase revenue to appease the investors. I also haven’t seen much innovation on Curricula.  I really really hope this has been a wake up call to you guys because before any product you announced was a no brainer because I trusted the company, that’s eroding for me.\n\n#### Comment ID kr12v2v with +4 score by [(After_Working, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kr12v2v/) (in reply to ID kqyc4sq):\nI went big into MDR, realised it wasn’t doing much so pulled 1500 seats back to Sophos MDR.

BPC has caught for us, in the last two months:\n\n* Someone that was cheating a CA policy with a VPN.\n* Clients with VPN issues, VPS issues\n* Three impossible travel scenarios.\n* Four MFA bypass attacks with full Conditional Access in place (with number matching and GeoFiltering)\n* Several false positives on endpoints that were related to admittedly suspicious Powershell.\n\nLook, I won't say everything's perfect (and they 100% know who this is, by my Reddit name - Hi Britt, Will, Xav, Jon, Mo...), their portal needs *work*, for example, but damn if they aren't responsive as hell and actively developing for the MSP community. I'll have a testimonial out for their SOC (which is... spectacular and knowledgable) at Right of Boom in a few weeks.\n\nI've had to move some stuff along occasionally, and I am 100% sure their team is sick of my crap, but... I *really* do not want to leave them. I'm feeling like we won't, and if we were, it 100% wouldn't be technical - I have much faith in their SOC, both the endpoint agent and the 365 monitoring.\n\nWhen I looked at Huntress, they were equally amazing and powerful. We didn't choose them for two reasons:\n\n* I don't need Process Insights (their EDR). Our clients use the highest rated, best performing EDR - Defender.\n* It was very clear to me after *several* meetings (Again, I love what they do for the community, and their team is very obviously top notch, so I really did try with Huntress) that they would only send recommendations, not take action besides isolation. This may very well have changed, of course, but that was the case last year.\n\nBoth are awesome - BPC is more expensive and I believe it to be more fully featured. I'll happily answer more questions around here too - feel free to check out my post history, I work for an MSP, not for either org.\n\n### Comment ID kqy4i75 with +3 score by [(cassini12, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqy4i75/) (in reply to ID kqy1xoq):\nThank you for your great answer!

It seems almost very surprising that a company as \"together\" as Huntress would allow for such a hands off approach.\n\nI will more than likely move my clients to BP. I do have a question for you regarding your statement on EDR. A few webinars with Huntress in fact that I attended very much echoed your sentiment about the best EDR being Defender. Since my clients are almost all Business Prem licensed we have been toying with the idea of ditching  Sentinel One and just using Defender. (example: BP Snap + Cloud Response + Defender)  Is this what you are doing for day to day security? I will admit we roll with S1/Huntress as its pretty much set and forget and I was under the impression that Defender would require a decent amount of \"configuring\" before it was at the same level?

MDE is massively powerful and has things like Attack Surface Reduction, etc, and a ton of vulnerability stuff. It's immediately as good as S1 (turn on tamper protection), and can be *much* more deeply integrated in Windows... because Microsoft :)\n\n#### Comment ID kr00k5g with +3 score by [(jpete99, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kr00k5g/) (in reply to ID kqy4i75):\nHuntress costs significantly less than BP.

So now we have full eyes on glass and hands on keyboards watching over clients using either MS or Google. I can confirm that their SOC WILL action alerts even before they pick up the phone.

When we were on boarding ourselves we got the 365 integration configured and within a few minutes some of our contractors in Kenya’s accounts were restricted. Once confirming to Blackpoint SOC they were legitimate logins they were unlocked immediately and then a full report provided within minutes. Also had some minor deployment issues with an environment and their support team couldn’t have been better to work with on finding a workaround and committing to determine the root cause of the issue. Still early on in our journey with them but i couldn’t be happier with their services.\n\n## Comment ID kqyayrq with +3 score by [(Real_Admin, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqyayrq/) (in reply to ID 1atjpws):\nYeah we use BP, if it's going to trigger a response, they act then notify in my experience.

I know, testing is extremely difficult, but we have had many discussions and invested so many hours, looking at the solutions, carried out ransomware testing on VMs, etc. That was about half a year ago and Blackpoint cut the best figure. Both in terms of know-how and the solution itself. Many solutions such as Arctic Wolf etc. simply fall through the net because they only send an email saying \"hey there's something, take a look\" but that doesn't help us if it's at 3 a.m. and we're all sleeping like babies... \n\nThe M365 integration is also extremely important, as we are an MS Shop and work with Defender for Endpoint, Servers. \n\nIn the end, we and our customers (the internal IT management) were convinced by the maturity of the product as well as the processes undertaken by BP. Laura as well as Mo (hi there) were also able to help us close a huge deal with one of our larger customers. \n\nSince implementing BP they have blocked several logins etc. Even though we have CA policies and follow best practices you never have a guarantee and that is what Blackpoint is for. \nSecurity is like an onion, you have to look at it in layers and layers, and one of them is a SOC these days but is never a guarantee.\n\n## Comment ID kqxxxfi with +10 score by [(brokerceej, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqxxxfi/) (in reply to ID 1atjpws):\nWe've been using Blackpoint since they were a small shop.

Even going through PAX8 you need to check to ensure monthly that you are being billed the correct amount of overages for both devices and licensed users.

Also they go by licensed users for M365 and this will include Microsoft Teams resource accounts or any other licensed user that doesn’t have a mailbox.

LastPass isn't the only vendor.\n* With that said, this complex decision to host a webinar with LastPass was a call made by \\*ME\\*. Dive in below for a some real talk on how I made the decision.\n\n\\----\n\nHuntress is a security company that lives/breathes/shits breaches, cybercrime, and risk management.

We've been there when we've [failed expectations](https://www.huntress.com/blog/huntress-mdr-for-microsoft-365-update). We've been there when we've [had our own security incident](https://www.huntress.com/blog/investigating-unauthorized-access-huntress-qa-environment-incident).\n\nAs a staunch shit-talker against those who fail to embody transparency AND a customer of LastPass during \\*both\\* of their security incidents / massively botched disclosure, you can imagine my first reaction when I was pitched to do a webinar with LastPass...🙄\n\nDespite us doing [deep diligence on their tech](https://i.imgur.com/VTelIez.png) and [concluding Huntress + our Partner base were safe with our continued use](https://i.imgur.com/BnsWpu2.png), I still had a ton of concern connecting our brand's reputation (this isn't our first time catching flack for [LastPass](https://i.imgur.com/kDI5P5f.png)).\n\nHowever, what ultimately changed my mind was a convo with one of our more junior teammates who kicked me where it counts when they dropped these three pithy points:\n\n1. The devil you know (a company publicly pwned twice) has likely learned a ton of hard lessons\n2. More SMBs people use LastPass than any other password manager—can we help them change their culture?\n3. Why can't Huntress equally educate any password manager's audience, while avoiding anything exclusive?\n\nWith these points, our past due diligence into LastPass, and the reality that [we're discovering 5-10K cleartext password files](https://i.imgur.com/zRPeEFq.png) each week on our partners/customers endpoints (more lulz [here](https://i.imgur.com/uDgcKWS.png)), I made the decision to invest real cash and effort into partnering with many noteworthy vendors to drive the adoption of three technologies we don't sell:\n\n* Password Managers\n* 2FA/MFA/SSO\n* Security Posture Management\n\nThe goal is fairly simple: drive education to ultimately increase demand for our MSP partners. If you all grow, Huntress grows and stays one step further away from becoming PE acquisition target. 📈\n\nI hope this makes it clear that the OP highlighted out a correct point: Huntress is going to host webinars and explore partnerships with vendors that will help drive education across the most underprotected, underresourced, and under attack SMBs. We're also going to leverage the hell outta our integrity, transparency, and tech chops to make sure we're not inadvertently promoting something we wouldn't use ourselves.\n\nWith all of that said, please light me up with any questions, thoughts, or concerns. I live here on r/MSP with ya and can take a blow or twelve before I start to cut onions. 😿\n\nKyle, PR firefighter guy de jour @ Huntress\n\n### Comment ID m08a23m with +20 score by [(FlavonoidsFlav, Reddit, 2024-12-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1h580qz/huntress_lastpass/m08a23m/) (in reply to ID m0852i2):\nHey Kyle,\n\nAs always, thanks for the engagement.

Everyone's fine to make a single mistake, but *two* breaches on a security focused product is a death knell. Also, and this is *really* important:\n\n**It's not that they got breached that bothers the community. It's that LastPass [LIED] (https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146205/lastpass-independent-company-security-breaches) to us saying data was not stolen when hackers absolutely got a backup database, and breaches have occurred linked directly to that false information.**\n\nThat's a big, big deal and a massive erosion of trust. Couple that with *two* breaches (again, I'm all for forgiveness on mistakes, we all forgave your organization when one happened, but not *two*) and this is a company that's dead to me, at least.\n\nI'm a current Blackpoint customer trialing Huntress, and I gotta be honest, this is absolutely going to factor into our organization's calculus as to whether to join up or not. \n\nThe rest of your post is solid, well written, and comes from the heart, and I feel personally that it's honest. It's that I just don't think *you* understand how badly Lastpass burned the community, which is strange, as I normally feel like you \"get it\". Hopefully that perspective is useful. Again, I don't speak for us all, but I'm the security manager at a large MSP, and this is my opinion.\n\n#### Comment ID m08vz9n with +3 score by [(marqo09, Reddit, 2024-12-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1h580qz/huntress_lastpass/m08vz9n/) (in reply to ID m08a23m):\nAppreciate the balanced response homie! Frankly, I'm a toe deep with our LastPass relationship including an upcoming webinar and local field event in Australia so doesn't take much to double-down with our other password manager vendors.\n\nAlthough I'm not willing to fall on the sword here for LastPass, I do think it's worth diving into the substance of the matter as a community. Maybe we start with two major questions that I think you alluded to:\n\n>Does LastPass' technology put the community's cybersecurity at risk?  \nCan LastPass be trusted?\n\n# Does LastPass' technology put the community's cybersecurity at risk?\n\nWith our access to systems, data, credible public commentary ([1](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/09/experts-fear-crooks-are-cracking-keys-stolen-in-lastpass-breach/), [2](https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/28/23529547/lastpass-vault-breach-disclosure-encryption-cybersecurity-rebuttal), [3](https://palant.info/2022/12/26/whats-in-a-pr-statement-lastpass-breach-explained/), [4](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2023/03/03/why-you-should-stop-using-lastpass-after-new-hack-method-update/), etc), and the deep inhouse security expertise we have, we are technically comfortable with LastPass (albeit their mitigations to unencrypted fields and low password iterations/hashing rounds should have never happened in the first place). Until we see real weaponization of quantum computing, I don't \\*expect\\* to see major mass fallout from stolen vaults (which is absolutely gonna happen to EVERY cloud based password manager--including LastPass again). That is me throwing the controversial point out there that:\n\n>I *don't think* we'll see LastPass' **technology** put the community's cybersecurity at risk. (can't wait to see how this ages)\n\nIf others have more detailed opinions/perspective (whether you had the chance to work internally with LastPass as a customer or some other sweet access), I'd love to hear it.\n\n# Can LastPass be trusted?\n\nI think this is really where most folks (me included) have struggled / are struggling.  I've gotta join a staff meeting for a couple hours, but will come back with my thoughts shortly.\n\n<PLACEHOLDER FOR TRUST THOUGHTS>\n\n### Comment ID m08g4t7 with +11 score by [(mattmbit, Reddit, 2024-12-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1h580qz/huntress_lastpass/m08g4t7/) (in reply to ID m0852i2):\nBasically saying \"they've been breached twice there's no way it'll happen again\"  is really concerning.

We are currently utilizing Bitdefender, but we have heard good things about Huntress in conjunction with Windows Defender. What are the pros and cons of each? The price seems similar (with all the Bitdefender options enabled), but Huntress requires a 1 year contract. Which way should we go and why?\n\n## Comment ID ktirolk with +12 score by [(amw3000, Reddit, 2024-03-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1b7d74x/bitdefender_vs_huntress_windows_defender/ktirolk/) (in reply to ID 1b7d74x):\nHuntress and Microsoft Defender AV (aka Windows Defender) is a great combo but it can quickly become a show stopper/pain point:\n\n1. macOS devices. You can install the Huntress agent and it provides some protection but its not an AV. There is no \"Managed AV component\". Defender for Endpoint macOS cannot be managed by Huntress and is only an EDR, not an AV (please someone correct me!).\n2. Older OS's. Everyone says don't support older devices but money talks and they somehow remain supported. \n3. Be mindful of how MS Defender AV works. If there's another AV solution registered, Defender will either disable itself or put itself in a passive mode. This means Huntress cannot properly manage MS Defender AV. Other AV solutions like WebRoot (I do not recommend WebRoot!!), Bitdefender, Trend, etc install along side other AVs with minimal issues. Easy to say \"just remove other AV solutions\" but this can result in a lot of work, rebooting computers in safe mode, working with vendors. etc. \n\nIf none of the above is an issue for you, 100% take that Bitdefender spend and throw it at Huntress. If you have concerns with agreements and terms, talk to them. They are more than just a company that wants to take your money. Their involvement with this subreddit as well as the MSP community as a whole is proof. \n\nI used Bitdefender and made the switch a couple years. Overall, Bitdefender isn't the worst. I think they provide great valid for basic AV but all the addon's is where things start go downhill. Charging for something like storing Bitlocker keys is insane given the extremely limited options. Support is also painful to deal with. They do not understand the MSP space nor do most of their resellers. PAX8 has great support for Bitdefender but once its beyond basic issues, they loop in Bitdefender support and you start to feel the pain. Again, great folks at PAX8 but their scope of support is limited.\n\n## Comment ID kthyrbh with +33 score by [(dbh2, Reddit, 2024-03-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1b7d74x/bitdefender_vs_huntress_windows_defender/kthyrbh/) (in reply to ID 1b7d74x):\nHuntress.

Bitdefender GravityZone gives you prevention, protection, and detection capabilities (with EDR/XDR). Or you can get detection as a service with Bitdefender MDR.\n\nThe better the first two pillars are, the less work there is for detection and response. It is still critical (e.g. our MDR reports that about 70% of security incidents start from unmanaged machines), especially for ransomware attacks, but you need to be careful how you evaluate its effectiveness. And you definitely don't want to rely on detection more than on prevention/protection (it's an equivalent of stopping the car by crashing with an airbag instead of using brakes).\n\nIf you have any specific questions about Bitdefender MDR, I can get you answers (I frequently interact with that team). Most of the team is based in San Antonio, they are all ex-military types - these influence how they are structured, how they operate etc...\n\nI would summarize the major MDR differentiators like this:\n\n\\- **Intelligence Team** \\- comes from a military background of the team, the MDR team has a dedicated team (CIFC) for intelligence that is focused on supporting operations.\n\n\\- **Baselining** \\- the team spends quite a lot of effort in baselining your environment to understand what's normal and what's not.\n\n\\- **Native XDR** \\- Access to product developers and security researchers is a big advantage, including access to the forensics team or malware analysis if needed.\n\n\\- **Human-led analysis** \\- Some MDRs are not much more than automated emails (this was a big surprise to me during the MITRE MDR evaluations).\n\nHuntress is comparable feature-wise with the basic Foundations, but there are more features available in Premium/Enterprise.\n\n## Comment ID kthxiwh with +4 score by [(redditistooqueer, Reddit, 2024-03-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1b7d74x/bitdefender_vs_huntress_windows_defender/kthxiwh/) (in reply to ID 1b7d74x):\nWhy not do bitdefender + huntress.

Maybe they also do the same portal for the EDR version of defender, I dunno.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Huntress is just as good with or without defender.\n\n#### Comment ID kti3x7b with +2 score by [(brianinca, Reddit, 2024-03-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1b7d74x/bitdefender_vs_huntress_windows_defender/kti3x7b/) (in reply to ID kthzbmj):\nWe added Huntress alongside SentinelOne.

And we use Huntress to add the exclusions to Defender for us.\n\nEdit: Gave the wrong link to the ASR rules.

I feel Bitdefender has a few more bows and alerting…. \n\nWe also use Threatlocker, so I have a good backup.

Huntress has the best integration with Defender.\n\nHowever, I don't think of Huntress as having less alerts, but less noise.

Huntress was built on the passion and expertise of its people, but somewhere along the way, that was forgotten.

A string of misguided executive hires has resulted in a company that is disorganized, ineffective, and directionless. Leadership lacks a clear strategy, and decision-making feels reactive rather than intentional.\n\nThe company’s core values were changed last year, which only formalized what employees had already observed—transparency and integrity had long since disappeared. Internal culture has shifted to one where those who challenge leadership or offer constructive criticism are quietly sidelined, while those who validate egos are rewarded. Silos, infighting, and a lack of internal mobility have made career growth difficult, if not impossible.\n\nRecruiting and retention have become a challenge, with leadership now encouraging employees to post positive Glassdoor reviews in an attempt to counteract growing reputational concerns. Employee sentiment surveys consistently highlight that satisfaction drops sharply after the first year—once the reality of the dysfunction sets in.\n\nHuntress had the potential to be something great, but without strong leadership and a genuine commitment to fixing its internal issues, it’s hard to see how it recovers.",

One of the things I appreciate most is the company's ability to recognize when something—or someone—isn’t the right fit and take action quickly. No company gets it right 100% of the time, but the willingness to acknowledge, adapt, and improve is what sets this leadership team apart.\n\nMy advice? Keep leading with honesty and realness. I will always respect direct, transparent conversations over the sugar-coated narratives I’ve been fed at other companies. The trust built through that kind of leadership is invaluable, and it’s a big part of why this company continues to thrive. Keep fostering this culture of authenticity and accountability—it’s what makes this place truly special!",

With expansion comes ebb and flow in workload, but the work-life balance here more than makes up for it. If you're adaptable and excited by growth, you'll thrive—because this company is going places!",

I feel heard, supported, and given constructive feedback that is both meaningful and uplifting. The work-life balance is incredible, and the teams I collaborate with provide valuable perspectives and insights every day. What truly sets this company apart is the people—from my direct team to leadership at every level, including the CEO, CFO, and VPs. I’ve had the opportunity to engage in impactful business conversations while also getting to know them on a personal level, which is rare.\n\nOne thing I want to address is the misconception that this company only cares about \"dollars and cents.\" As someone in finance, I see firsthand how much employees are valued beyond just the numbers. We are not just a workforce—we are a BA community. From Winter Summit to department meetings to Summer Summit, we feel the love. We get to travel, connect in person, and experience appreciation in ways that truly matter—whether it’s strategy sessions in exciting locations, company-paid lunches, incredible swag, or even Broadway shows!\n\nThis is the first place I’ve worked where I feel both externally appreciated and internally validated—I see the direct impact of my work, and I know I’m making a difference. I wake up excited to contribute, and I go to bed grateful to be part of a company that doesn’t just say they care—they show it.\n\nIf you’re looking for a place where you’ll be valued, challenged, and supported—this is it.",

In addition, promotions are scarce at best. The most deserving wait years to potentially get promoted, most are still stagnant in their roles while outside hires supersede them. The Huntress product development also was top notch. Recently, the company decided to focus only on sales and encouraged the sales teams to promote products that were not ready.

          "cons": "I am loathe to have to write this, but I feel like I have to warn prospects and current leaders about the culture at the company (doubt they'll care). Huntress is succeeding despite it's best efforts to sabotage itself. And I want it to succeed.\n\nHuntress's culture has declined to the point that the direction of the company is in the balance. Employees no longer have any loyalty, because of a lack of a feeling of job security. Loyalty and pride used to be main drivers behind employee morale. The pride everyone used to have is waning, as they realize the company does not care about them at all. Employees are feeling like they're just a cog in the wheel.\n\nThe company cycles through leaders in all departments so quickly that there is no loyalty or feeling of job security. Every department's leadership has cycled numerous times in just a few years, except the one that needs a refresh. Once leaders leave, the current employees are no longer supported by the new crew, and many often are cycled out also.\n\nThe company is led by founders without business chops or background. If you don't play their bro game, you're out. They are executing a playbook to cycle out leaders every 12-18 months, a strategy that may have benefits in the short term, but destroys culture and morale. The founders have no clue how to lead or what is needed at each position, and it shows. No sophisticated leader would follow this juvenile strategy. \n\nWhile I do not think it's intentional, the leadership style by the founders is that of fear. Yes, it's their company (although now at Series D, they have board bosses that should step in). Look, the founders had a great idea, designed a sweet product, and built a good company. But, they have not evolved as leaders with the stage of the company. Instead of seeing that, the problem is always someone else. Nobody ever meets their standards, communication is ineffective or nonexistent, and role definitions change or are misunderstood. Instead of bringing people along and up, the founders lead by fear and cycle out bodies for the new shiny toy. Really great, super qualified employees are not up-leveled or refreshed to retain them-the company mindset is apparently we can just go get someone else. Everyone is afraid to disagree or to take initiative, as it's always \"wrong.\" Beloved leaders and employees are being purged for \"the next stage\" -- a next stage that nobody seems to understand. \n\nImportantly, no one feels like they'll be a part of the future they talk about. When founders talk about massive future growth, the eye rolls start as most do not think they'll be a part of it. If the company ever goes public, it will likely do so without anyone who was a part of its growth stages. That is jarring. Only the founders will ring that bell. Other leaders who have the background, chops, and institutional knowledge will have left a company they help grow gangbusters. It's bonkers.\n\nThe culture has suffered. Almost everyone is actively looking for positions elsewhere, and aren't even quiet about it--from those here 6 months to those with 4 years behind them. Largely because they just don't know when they'll get the boot, and the constant stress of long hours and unknown as to whether it's enough (it never is).\n\nIf they did an actual anonymous poll, instead of one where replies can be tracked back (data broken down so granular is not anonymous), they'd get more candid feedback.\n\nFinally, do not believe all of the glowing reviews--the company incentivized people to positively review. \n\nYes, outwardly the branding is cool and the products kick butt. But inwardly, culture is toxic and future perceptions are bleak.\n\nSmoke and mirrors.\n\nThe company needs a pause and reset.",

I am sorry that your experience and thoughts about Huntress are so bleak. \n\nYou raise multiple points and we fully appreciate that they reflect your feelings.  No one can argue or dismiss those.  We noted this post was also cross-posted to Reddit, so the feelings are clearly real and strong.    \n\nWe love transparency and appreciate that Glassdoor asks both teammates and the company to share perspectives.  So we would be remiss to not share some data (which we share with radical transparency at monthly all-company Town Halls so our teammates can personally track the details) and reactions-\n\n-\tAttrition rates for the year are in the single digits, and trending down. Headcount has grown 2x in the last two years, and we are planning for the same in the next two, because . . . \n\n-\tEach of our four products are growing at industry-leading rates, and current customer revenue retention rates are a world-class 140%. Suffice to say, our Product dev team is second to none, and, the Huntress secret sauce to developing differentiated, high-value, managed solutions continues to sustain our hyper-growth! Investors have piled boat loads of cash into our cause the last few years for us to continue proliferating the 'Huntress Way' to wrecking hackers. \n\n-\t90 teammates (~ 1/3 of 1+ yr tenured workforce) have been promoted or earned another career growth opportunity as part of our 2x / yr compensation and promo review process.  Many more than this received merit-based pay adjustments. Every promotion has been shown and celebrated at Town Halls (aka- “Movers &amp; Shakers”) so all teammates know who they are.\n\n-\tAlso, every name &amp; face of our 150+ hires and the handful of leavers have also been shown, so all teammates can clearly track who’s coming and going. \n\n-\tWe recently won an Inc. best places to work award (granted exclusively on employee feedback from a survey they ran).  Our recent semi-annual anonymous (guaranteed by the vendor we utilize) survey showed a huge leap in employee net promotor score (58 - considered top tier in tech industry) \n\n-\tFollowing our anonymous in-house surveys, we ask people to post externally to Glassdoor (aka- “You’ve shared your voice with us in this survey; now we ask that you tell the world”).  We encourage people to post transparently and authentically how they are feeling- not directing what to say.  And of course there’s no way to incentivize posts with it all being anonymous.\n\n\nIn summary, every data point shared here is shared with all teammates monthly, as we embrace radical transparency.  In short, our BA hacker talent has driven extraordinary growth, enabling us to continually invest more into growing our teammates, and there’s no end in site.  Two things have remained true for nine years and will continue:\n*Hackers gonna hack.\n*Huntress gonna hunt.",

This fosters a collaborative, engaging, and fun-filled work environment unlike any I've encountered.\n\nThe onboarding process at Huntress was top-notch. It was well-structured, informative, and made me feel welcomed from the start. The comprehensive resources provided made navigating the first few weeks with ease. This level of preparedness is a stark contrast to my experiences at other companies.\n\nHuntress has cultivated a truly special workplace culture. I am thrilled to be part of a team that is making a tangible difference in the industry!!",

        "cons": "I am loathe to have to write this, but I feel like I have to warn prospects and current leaders about the culture at the company (doubt they'll care). Huntress is succeeding despite it's best efforts to sabotage itself. And I want it to succeed.\n\nHuntress's culture has declined to the point that the direction of the company is in the balance. Employees no longer have any loyalty, because of a lack of a feeling of job security. Loyalty and pride used to be main drivers behind employee morale. The pride everyone used to have is waning, as they realize the company does not care about them at all. Employees are feeling like they're just a cog in the wheel.\n\nThe company cycles through leaders in all departments so quickly that there is no loyalty or feeling of job security. Every department's leadership has cycled numerous times in just a few years, except the one that needs a refresh. Once leaders leave, the current employees are no longer supported by the new crew, and many often are cycled out also.\n\nThe company is led by founders without business chops or background. If you don't play their bro game, you're out. They are executing a playbook to cycle out leaders every 12-18 months, a strategy that may have benefits in the short term, but destroys culture and morale. The founders have no clue how to lead or what is needed at each position, and it shows. No sophisticated leader would follow this juvenile strategy. \n\nWhile I do not think it's intentional, the leadership style by the founders is that of fear. Yes, it's their company (although now at Series D, they have board bosses that should step in). Look, the founders had a great idea, designed a sweet product, and built a good company. But, they have not evolved as leaders with the stage of the company. Instead of seeing that, the problem is always someone else. Nobody ever meets their standards, communication is ineffective or nonexistent, and role definitions change or are misunderstood. Instead of bringing people along and up, the founders lead by fear and cycle out bodies for the new shiny toy. Really great, super qualified employees are not up-leveled or refreshed to retain them-the company mindset is apparently we can just go get someone else. Everyone is afraid to disagree or to take initiative, as it's always \"wrong.\" Beloved leaders and employees are being purged for \"the next stage\" -- a next stage that nobody seems to understand. \n\nImportantly, no one feels like they'll be a part of the future they talk about. When founders talk about massive future growth, the eye rolls start as most do not think they'll be a part of it. If the company ever goes public, it will likely do so without anyone who was a part of its growth stages. That is jarring. Only the founders will ring that bell. Other leaders who have the background, chops, and institutional knowledge will have left a company they help grow gangbusters. It's bonkers.\n\nThe culture has suffered. Almost everyone is actively looking for positions elsewhere, and aren't even quiet about it--from those here 6 months to those with 4 years behind them. Largely because they just don't know when they'll get the boot, and the constant stress of long hours and unknown as to whether it's enough (it never is).\n\nIf they did an actual anonymous poll, instead of one where replies can be tracked back (data broken down so granular is not anonymous), they'd get more candid feedback.\n\nFinally, do not believe all of the glowing reviews--the company incentivized people to positively review. \n\nYes, outwardly the branding is cool and the products kick butt. But inwardly, culture is toxic and future perceptions are bleak.\n\nSmoke and mirrors.\n\nThe company needs a pause and reset.",

One of the things I appreciate most is the company's ability to recognize when something—or someone—isn’t the right fit and take action quickly. No company gets it right 100% of the time, but the willingness to acknowledge, adapt, and improve is what sets this leadership team apart.\n\nMy advice? Keep leading with honesty and realness. I will always respect direct, transparent conversations over the sugar-coated narratives I’ve been fed at other companies. The trust built through that kind of leadership is invaluable, and it’s a big part of why this company continues to thrive. Keep fostering this culture of authenticity and accountability—it’s what makes this place truly special!",
        "cons": "If I had to choose a \"con,\" it would simply be that I wish we had even more opportunities to meet in person—but only because I genuinely love the teams and traveling! The energy, collaboration, and connections we build during in-person events are incredible, and I always look forward to them.\n\nAdditionally, while I personally thrive in an environment of change and growth, I recognize that the fast-paced nature of a rapidly growing company might not be for everyone. With expansion comes ebb and flow in workload, but the work-life balance here more than makes up for it. If you're adaptable and excited by growth, you'll thrive—because this company is going places!",

Months later, I can confidently say that this company has exceeded every expectation.\n\nThe leadership here is unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. I feel heard, supported, and given constructive feedback that is both meaningful and uplifting. The work-life balance is incredible, and the teams I collaborate with provide valuable perspectives and insights every day. What truly sets this company apart is the people—from my direct team to leadership at every level, including the CEO, CFO, and VPs. I’ve had the opportunity to engage in impactful business conversations while also getting to know them on a personal level, which is rare.\n\nOne thing I want to address is the misconception that this company only cares about \"dollars and cents.\" As someone in finance, I see firsthand how much employees are valued beyond just the numbers. We are not just a workforce—we are a BA community. From Winter Summit to department meetings to Summer Summit, we feel the love. We get to travel, connect in person, and experience appreciation in ways that truly matter—whether it’s strategy sessions in exciting locations, company-paid lunches, incredible swag, or even Broadway shows!\n\nThis is the first place I’ve worked where I feel both externally appreciated and internally validated—I see the direct impact of my work, and I know I’m making a difference. I wake up excited to contribute, and I go to bed grateful to be part of a company that doesn’t just say they care—they show it.\n\nIf you’re looking for a place where you’ll be valued, challenged, and supported—this is it.",

        "advice": "Refocus on why this company was started and the core values that once set it apart. Over time, leadership has stopped listening, learning, and growing—and the business is now a reflection of that stagnation. The lack of collaboration and transparency has stifled creativity and innovation, causing the company to lose the edge that once made it stand out. Huntress was built on the passion and expertise of its people, but somewhere along the way, that was forgotten. If leadership truly wants to turn things around, they need to rebuild trust, foster an environment where employees feel valued and heard, and remember that their greatest asset has always been the talent they bring in—not just the technology they build.",
        "cons": "Huntress was once a company with immense promise, but poor leadership decisions have steadily eroded what made it great. A string of misguided executive hires has resulted in a company that is disorganized, ineffective, and directionless. Leadership lacks a clear strategy, and decision-making feels reactive rather than intentional.\n\nThe company’s core values were changed last year, which only formalized what employees had already observed—transparency and integrity had long since disappeared. Internal culture has shifted to one where those who challenge leadership or offer constructive criticism are quietly sidelined, while those who validate egos are rewarded. Silos, infighting, and a lack of internal mobility have made career growth difficult, if not impossible.\n\nRecruiting and retention have become a challenge, with leadership now encouraging employees to post positive Glassdoor reviews in an attempt to counteract growing reputational concerns. Employee sentiment surveys consistently highlight that satisfaction drops sharply after the first year—once the reality of the dysfunction sets in.\n\nHuntress had the potential to be something great, but without strong leadership and a genuine commitment to fixing its internal issues, it’s hard to see how it recovers.",
        "lengthOfEmployment": 0,
        "pros": "At one time, the best thing about working at Huntress was the people. The company attracted talented, passionate individuals who genuinely cared about helping small businesses stay secure. The culture was built on collaboration, and there was a strong sense of camaraderie among employees who believed in the mission.\n\nAnother major benefit is the fully remote work environment, which offers flexibility and a great work-life balance. This has been one of the company’s strongest selling points and remains a key advantage.",

The only time diversity is discussed is when our CEO shares awkward thoughts on diversity in town halls, it's awful.  Several leaders have been removed from the organization or demoted, all were women or people of color.  The individuals who replaced them are not upgrades and of course, they all look our c-suite, which is not diverse at all.  \n\nThe company seems to be scrambling to grow and instead of looking for the true source of pain points, they find it easier to blame a handful of leaders, push them out, and replace them.",

      "# [Understanding the ConnectWise ScreenConnect CVE-2024-1709 & CVE-2024-1708](https://www.huntress.com/blog/a-catastrophe-for-control-understanding-the-screenconnect-authentication-bypass)\nOn February 19, 2024, ConnectWise published a security advisory for ScreenConnect version 23.9.8, referencing two vulnerabilities and software weaknesses. The same day, Huntress researchers worked to understand this threat and successfully recreated a proof-of-concept exploit demonstrating its impact.\n\nThis write-up will discuss our analysis efforts and the technical details behind this attack, which we’re coining as “SlashAndGrab.”\n\nThe ConnectWise advisory indicated that in all versions of ScreenConnect below 23.9.8 there were two vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2024-1709: Authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel (CWE-288)\n\nCVE-2024-1708: Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory (“path traversal”) (CWE-22)\n\nThe first vulnerability was disclosed with a critical base CVSS scoring of 10, the highest possible severity. The authentication bypass would ultimately open the door for the second vulnerability.\n\nConnectWise made a patch available and expressed that all on-premise versions of ScreenConnect 23.9.7 and below must be updated immediately—cloud instances were already automatically patched.\n\nAt the time of release, the ConnectWise advisory was very sparse on technical details. There was not much information available as to what these vulnerabilities really consisted of, how they might be taken advantage of, or any other threat intelligence or indicators of compromise to hunt for.\n\nOnce we recreated the exploit and attack chain, we came to the same conclusion: there should not be public details about the vulnerability until there had been adequate time for the industry to patch. It would be too dangerous for this information to be readily available to threat actors.\n\nBut, with other vendors now publicly sharing the proof-of-concept exploit, the cat is out of the bag. We now feel that sharing our analysis shares no more threat than what is already available. So, we’re ready to spill the beans.\n\nThe “exploit” is trivial and embarrassingly easy.\n\nBelow is a video demonstration of our recreated proof-of-concept exploit, which performs the simple authentication bypass but takes it a step further to showcase remote code execution.\n\nOur Analysis\n\nWhen the Huntress team was made aware of the ConnectWise advisory, our team began to dig into what changes were made in the patch that could help explain what these vulnerabilities were.\n\nWe could simply look for the differences between code present in the new, patched version, and the previous, unpatched version. Creating a local testing environment for both of these states of the ScreenConnect software, we could easily see the delta that might clue us into the potential exploit.\n\nWe observed that these files differed:\n\nCVE-2024-1709 - Authentication Bypass\n\nMost of these changes observed in the new version were binary files, which require decompilation to compare; however, SetupWizard.aspx is a text file. When looking at the differences in this file, it immediately looked promising:\n\nIn the newest update, we can see there is a new check to ensure that the instance is set up before allowing the user to use the setup wizard. This piqued our interest as, at face value, version 23.9.7 already blocked access to the setup wizard after authentication. Looking closer into ScreenConnect.SetupModule inside of ScreenConnect.Web.dll sheds more light on the exploitation path.\n\nIn previous versions of ScreenConnect, this handler was registered for the OnBeginRequest event, while in 28.9.8 it is registered for the OnPostMapRequestHandler event. This was seemingly done so that the context.Handler field will be populated. A new check is added to validate if the resolved HTTP handler implements the new ISetupHandler interface whereas the old code simply checked that Request.Path string matched “/SetupWizard.aspx”. This change implies that there was some way to bypass the string comparison of Request.Path in previous versions. If the request path does not match “/SetupWizard.aspx,” then the setup wizard will be allowed regardless of the setup state of the instance.\n\nThis would normally not be exploitable, but .Net has weird functionality that allows URL path components after a mapped legitimate URL to be passed along to the application. This information is exposed in Request.FilePath, Request.PathInfo and Request.Path. For example, if there is a legitimate path “/something.aspx”, then .Net will allow the user to request “/something.aspx/anythingelse” and will pass along the trailing bit after the file path via the Request.PathInfo. However, Request.Path always contains bothRequest.FilePath and Request.PathInfo per MSDN documentation:\n\nPutting this together, it means we can simply request “/SetupWizard.aspx/literallyanything” and we should be allowed to access the setup wizard on already-configured ScreenConnect instances.\n\nThe setup wizard is responsible for setting up the initial administrative user and installing a license on the system during initial setup. The user creation portion of this setup happens immediately after clicking the “Next” button on the setup page, so there is no need to complete the setup wizard fully to exploit the system (i.e. you do not need to replace or have access to a valid license key). Completing this step will completely overwrite the internal user database. All other local users will be deleted aside from the user you specify in the setup wizard.\n\nOnce you have administrative access to a compromised instance, it is trivial to create and upload a malicious ScreenConnect extension to gain Remote Code Execution (RCE). This is not a vulnerability, but a feature of ScreenConnect, which allows an administrator to create extensions that execute .Net code as SYSTEM on the ScreenConnect server.\n\nCVE-2024-1708 - Path Traversal\n\nThe second vulnerability referenced in the ConnectWise ScreenConnect advisory presents a risk of ZipSlip attacks. We observed changes to ScreenConnect.Core.dll:\n\nand ScreenConnect.Server.dll:\n\nThis adds new function arguments to strictly handle file paths when extracting content from a ZIP file. Looking through the code base, we can see these utility functions only seem to be used when handling ScreenConnect extensions. Prior to this patch, a malicious extension could potentially write files anywhere within C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ScreenConnect\\App_Extensions instead of being properly restricted to their extension subdirectory.\n\nWhile this is another vulnerability fixed in version 23.9.8 that could lead to remote code execution in certain conditions, it relies upon having administrative credentials and access to be able to use the Extensions functionality. This capability is “unlocked” by the authentication bypass, but is less severe on its own.\n\nIn our recreated proof-of-concept exploit, taking advantage of this potential ZipSlip attack vector was not necessary; after gaining administrator access with the authentication bypass, it was already possible to run arbitrary code with the typical Extensions feature set. The primary difference being that malicious code written using this vulnerability does not necessarily need an installed extension to execute. This means that it may go unnoticed more easily within your environment. Any .aspx or .ashx files within the root of C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ScreenConnect\\App_Extensions\\ are likely malicious artifacts. ScreenConnect does not place any files within this directory normally.\n\nDetection Guidance\n\nWhile researching the above vulnerabilities, Huntress identified Indicators Of Compromise (IOCs) and developed a set of detections that can be used to notify ScreenConnect users of potential malicious activity.\n\nAs a reminder, per Huntress’s previous post, the below listed SIGMA rules that leverage Windows Event ID 4663 requires that the Advanced Auditing policy be configured, and an appropriate SACL applied to the directory. Please refer to the previous blog post for how to generate this event.\n\nCVE-2024-1709 - Authentication Bypass\n\nWhile replicating the Authentication Bypass exploit, Huntress observed IIS logs for the malicious SetupWizard.aspx URL path, which can be used as an indicator of compromise:\n\nThe following Sigma rule will detect requests made to SetupWizard.aspx with a trailing path segment. This behavior is never legitimate, and should clearly indicate malicious intent if observed in the wild.\n\nAfter accessing the Setup Wizard, an attacker will input new credentials to gain access to Screen Connect. Doing so will write a new user database to a temporary XML file. The following Sigma rule can be used to detect the ScreenConnect server writing to a temporary XML file on the server. While this may be an indicator of compromise, this activity is known to also be observed when legitimately modifying local users or their permissions in ScreenConnect, so there is a non-zero false positive rate.\n\nThe following YARA rule is similar to the IIS log Sigma rule given above. It will detect IIS log entries that reference SetupWizard.aspx with a trailing path component. As mentioned previously, a trailing path component on this file is always associated with malicious activity.\n\nCVE-2024-1708 - Path Traversal\n\nThe path traversal exploit allows attackers to write files within the root of the App_Extensions directory. The following Sigma rule should alert on file modifications at the root of the App_Extensions directory while excluding legitimate modifications to extensions themselves.",
      "# [Huntress Captures $150M Series D At $1.5B-Plus Valuation by Chris Metinko on 2024-06-18](https://news.crunchbase.com/cybersecurity/huntress-unicorn-wiz-startup-venture-funding/)\nMaryland-based Huntress became the newest cybersecurity unicorn after it raised a $150 million Series D at a $1.5 billion-plus valuation.\n\nThe new round was led by Kleiner Perkins, Meritech Capital and existing investor Sapphire Ventures.\n\nThe startup focuses on security services for small business to small enterprise customers — an often overlooked sector in cyber as many companies chase Fortune 500 companies.\n\n“Everyone deserves the ability to protect themselves and their employees’ livelihoods. This is the ‘why’ that supercharges my team to work around the clock and democratize access to the tools and talent typically built for the enterprise,” said co-founder and CEO Kyle Hanslovan in a release.\n\nHuntress currently is realizing more than 70% year-to-year revenue growth for the past two years as it continues to “approach $100 million in annual recurring revenue.”\n\nFounded in 2015, Huntress has raised nearly $310 million, per Crunchbase.\n\nCyber funding\n\nHuntress’ fresh round is just the latest big cybersecurity round in a Q2 where funding has taken off.\n\nWith a couple of weeks still remaining in the quarter, cyber startups have raised $4.1 billion in 141 deals, per Crunchbase data. That far outpaces Q1’s numbers, when such startups raised $2.7 billion in 140 deals and smashes last year’s Q2 totals of $1.8 billion in 192 deals.\n\nOf course, this year’s Q2 numbers are helped out immensely by cloud security startup Wiz’s big announcement in May that it had raised $1 billion at a $12 billion valuation. That round is still the biggest in cybersecurity this year.\n\nOverall funding for the year is currently well ahead of this same point last year.\n\nRelated Crunchbase Pro query:\n\nCybersecurity Funding\n\nRelated reading:\n\nHuntress Tracks Down $40M Series B To Secure SMBs\n\nCloud Security Firm Wiz Raises $1B At $12B Valuation",
      "# [Cleo Software Actively Being Exploited in the Wild CVE-2024-55956](https://www.huntress.com/blog/threat-advisory-oh-no-cleo-cleo-software-actively-being-exploited-in-the-wild)\nCVE-2024-55956 Summary\n\nOn December 3, Huntress identified an emerging threat involving Cleo’s LexiCom, VLTransfer, and Harmony software, commonly used to manage file transfers. We’ve directly observed evidence of threat actors exploiting this software en masse and performing post-exploitation activity. Although Cleo published an update and advisory for CVE-2024-50623—which allows unauthenticated remote code execution—Huntress security researchers have recreated the proof of concept and learned the patch does not mitigate the software flaw.\n\nTL;DR - This vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild and fully patched systems running 5.8.0.21 are still exploitable. We strongly recommend you move any internet-exposed Cleo systems behind a firewall until a new patch is released.\n\nBased on our analysis, all versions prior to and including 5.8.0.21 are vulnerable:\n\nCleo Harmony® (5.8.0.21)\n\nCleo VLTrader® (5.8.0.21)\n\nCleo LexiCom® (5.8.0.21)\n\nOur team is working to reach the Cleo team to report our findings and develop a new patch to fully mitigate exploitation. This blog will be frequently updated as more details emerge.\n\nTradecraft We Observed\n\nThe three software solutions Harmony, VLTrader, and LexiCom are often installed in the root of the filesystem, as the suggested default in their installation process:\n\nC:\\LexiCom\n\nC:\\VLTrader\n\nC:\\Harmony\n\nWe have also observed installation folders in the typical C:\\Program Files (x86) directory. Inside the installation folder are numerous subdirectories, with some more pertinent to the tradecraft than others:\n\nlogs\\\n\nhost\\\n\nautorun\\\n\n(etc.)\n\nAs an example, we would find logs in a full path: C:\\LexiCom\\logs\\LexiCom.xml. Below is a record of the logs following threat actor exploitation:\n\nThere are multiple things to note in this log snippet:\n\nThe first artifact of the attack chain is autorun\\healthchecktemplate.txt. Autorun files are immediately read, interpreted, and evaluated by LexiCom, Harmony, and VLTrader. We believe this is one of multiple files dropped onto the filesystem via the arbitrary file-write vulnerability. Files placed in the autorun folder are immediately deleted following their processing. Note: We have also seen autorun\\healthcheck.txt used as well.\n\nA “Warning” on the second entry indicates this instance is running version 5.8.0.0, which is the unpatched version. Our proof of concept, which we will discuss below, successfully exploits version 5.8.0.21.\n\nThe healthchecktemplate.txt autorun looks to invoke “Import” functionality, which is native and natural functionality of the Cleo software. The Import process reads in from a local file on disk. In this case, it loads temp\\LexiCom6836057879780436035.tmp, which we believe to be a second file dropped via the arbitrary file-write vulnerability. This .tmp file is actually a .ZIP file, containing a subdirectory hosts with an inner main.xml file, as you see imported.\n\nThe main.xml file observed from in-the-wild exploitation contains:\n\nNote the specific (and mischievous) date and timestamps: 2020/10/10 00:00:00 😉\n\nThis main.xml file stages a new autorun with an action (presumably built out to be healthcheck.txt) to invoke a PowerShell command and gain code execution. Unfortunately, the healthchecktemplate.txt and healthcheck.txt files placed in the autoruns subdirectory were automatically deleted and we do not yet know their contents.\n\nFigure 1: Exploitation as displayed within one of the Cleo software solutions\n\nThe decoded PowerShell command has been observed with this structure:\n\nThis process reaches out to an external IP address to retrieve new JAR files for continued post-exploitation. These JAR files contain webshell-like functionality for persistence on the endpoint.\n\nWe observed attackers later deleting these JAR files post-execution in order to prolong their attacks and stay relatively stealthy.\n\nAlso within the same logs folder, there may be a LexiCom.dbg log file. It will also contain information about any malicious autoruns files that have been processed, like so:\n\n[timestamp] LexiCom.syncer [redacted] Request In <<< Multipart:\n\nVLSync:SentReceipt;service=AS2;path=\"autorun/healthchecktemplate.txt\"\n\nFor further post-exploitation, the threat actors were observed enumerating potential Active Directory assets with domain reconnaissance tools like nltest.exe.\n\nHuntress EDR depicts this child-parent process relationship like so:\n\nFigure 2: Parent-child process relationship between nltest.exe\n\nObserved IP addresses for callbacks\n\n176.123.5.126 - AS 200019 (AlexHost SRL) - Moldova\n\n5.149.249.226 - AS 59711 (HZ Hosting Ltd) - Netherlands\n\n185.181.230.103 - AS 60602 (Inovare-Prim SRL) - Moldova\n\n209.127.12.38 - AS 55286 (SERVER-MANIA / B2 Net Solutions Inc) - Canada\n\n181.214.147.164 - AS 15440 (UAB Baltnetos komunikacijos) - Lithuania\n\n192.119.99.42 - AS 54290 (HOSTWINDS LLC) - United States\n\nTargets Exploited\n\nFrom our telemetry, we’ve discovered at least 10 businesses whose Cleo servers were compromised with a notable uptick in exploitation observed on December 8 around 07:00 UTC. After some initial analysis, however, we have found evidence of exploitation as early as December 3.\n\nThe majority of customers that we saw compromised deal with consumer products, food industry, trucking, and shipping industries. There are still several other companies outside of our immediate view who are potentially compromised as well.\n\nFigure 3: View of vulnerable Cleo server as seen on Shodan\n\nThe Huntress Proof of Concept\n\nHuntress communicated with Cleo on December 9 after creating our proof of concept. Over a Zoom call, they confirmed our understanding and the recreation of the attack chain.\n\nPrincipal Security Researcher Caleb Stewart crafted a Python script that leverages the arbitrary file-write primitive to place files inside the autoruns subdirectory and prove its execution. This was tested successfully against LexiCom as well as VLTrader with both versions 5.8.0.0 and patched version 5.8.0.21.\n\nAt the time of writing, Cleo is preparing a new CVE designation and expects a new patch to be released mid-week.\n\nHow to Stay Protected\n\nAt the time of writing, the 5.8.0.21 patched versions are insufficient against the exploit we are seeing in the wild. Speaking over a Zoom call, Cleo expressed that they will have a new patch available as soon as possible.\n\nIn the interim, we have suggested mitigations in an attempt to limit the attack surface. Knowing that the latter half of this attack path relies on code execution via the autoruns directory, it is possible to reconfigure Cleo software to disable this feature. However, this will not prevent the arbitrary file-write vulnerability until a patch is released.\n\nGot to the “Configure” menu of LexiCom, Harmony, or VLTrader\n\nSelect “Options”\n\nNavigate to the “Other” pane\n\nDelete the contents of the “Autorun Directory” field\n\nThis will remove the ability to process Autorun files. Please apply your own risk and threat model here -- your mileage may vary if you know that you use this feature in production.\n\nFigure 4: Cleo Harmony System Options showing the Autorun Directory option\n\nIf you are not a Huntress partner, review the hosts subdirectory in your software installation directory to determine if you have been affected. The presence of a main.xml or a 60282967-dc91-40ef-a34c-38e992509c2c.xml file (a name that looks to be reused across infections) with an embedded PowerShell-encoded command is a definitive indicator of compromise.\n\nHow Huntress Has Responded\n\nWe are actively detecting and neutralizing activity related to the exploit. To do so, we have taken a three-pronged approach to effectively detect, investigate, and respond to the threat.\n\nHuntress SOC analysts Austin Worline, Chad Hudson, Jai Minton, andTanner Filip created detections specifically conjured to hone in on and detect the activity triggered by the range of compromised Cleo products.\n\nFigure 5: Cleo Detection in Huntress EDR\n\nIn tandem, Huntress analyst Amelia Casley generated an internal investigation guide to ensure that the global Huntress SOC team could triage this emerging threat in a scalable and consistent way to keep our community secure.

      "# [Python Huntress on 2023-11-03](https://pythonhuntress.com/about/)\nIn 2019, Amy was a real estate broker with a very successful business that she had built over 13 years. When she learned that there was a Burmese Python problem in Florida, she had to check it out because she has always had a fascination and passion for snakes and reptiles. So Amy scheduled a Florida vacation to see what it was all about. She connected with professional python hunter, Donna Kalil, and went on a hunt where we caught a beautiful 9-foot python.\n\nFor Amy, it was absolutely the best day ever and she was totally hooked!\n\nA few days after returning home, Amy knew she had to move to Florida and figure out how to be a Burmese Python hunter. Suddenly she knew how to use her passion as more than just a hobby. She could help Florida with this colossal problem and make a difference in the world. Within six weeks Amy sold her real estate client database, rented a room in Miami, packed a few things, and drove to Florida to start a new life.\n\nLooking at this decision logically, it was ridiculous and insane. The python hunting program was a trial and no one could tell Amy if it was going to continue or if they would ever hire additional hunters. She didn’t have a job lined up. She didn’t know the area or where to hunt pythons. She didn’t know anyone, including the people she was going to live with.\n\nWhen Amy moved to Florida, she was one of the first one hundred hunters hired by the state. She has caught over 600 Burmese Pythons, the biggest one being 17’ 3”, 110 lbs (by herself). She has raised close to $600,000 by donating hunts to charity auctions. She has been featured on TV programs, documentaries, magazine articles and podcasts, including The New York Times, National Geographic, Time Magazine, The Today Show, Fox and Friends, CNBC and Reader’s Digest. Amy has started her own guiding service to take people out on python hunts. Out of her love of snakes and a desire to make something good from their demise, she figured out how to use their skin to make leather products.\n\nOne thing people ALWAYS ask Amy is, ‘Why Snakes’? And she says, “I have no idea.” Her fascination began when she was a little girl. Her dad took her to a creek and showed her how to catch all kinds of critters. It was the snakes that captured her imagination and fascination, and turned into a passion.\n\nAmy thinks of it like a musician who can naturally hear and play notes, or an interior decorator who can easily put together a room. “It’s just how I was born.” Sometimes she wonders why it couldn’t have been kittens or puppies or something a little more normal, but it’s snakes!\n\nSnakes have always been a part of Amy’s world. She was a volunteer at the Toledo Zoo in college, a breeder, an educator, part of the exotic pet and veterinary industries, and she has traveled to many places to find, observe and enjoy them. Becoming a python hunter just seemed like a logical next step.\n\nThe Burmese Pythons are beautiful and fascinating and it’s not their fault they are here. Unfortunately, they have to be removed and there is no other option.",
      "# [Huntress Unveils ‘Intuitive’ SIEM Offering Tailored To MSPs, SMBs by Kyle Alspach](https://www.crn.com/news/security/2024/huntress-unveils-intuitive-siem-offering-tailored-to-msps-smbs)\nThe vendor’s expansion into SIEM provides a new option that is less complicated and more affordable than competing platforms, while still providing a major improvement to security outcomes, Huntress CTO Chris Bisnett tells CRN.\n\nHuntress unveiled its new managed SIEM offering that aims to be a less-complicated and more-affordable alternative focused on the unique needs of MSPs and their SMB customers, according to Huntress Co-founder and CTO Chris Bisnett.\n\nThe expansion by Huntress into SIEM (security information and event management) is part of the vendor’s efforts at continuing to enable MSPs with a wider array of offerings on one platform for boosting SMB security outcomes, Bisnett said. It’s also significant because SIEM has traditionally been considered too complex and expensive for MSPs, he noted.\n\n[Related: Huntress CEO On Raising $150M To ‘Democratize’ SIEM, Data Protection For SMBs]\n\nAs it’s now being offered by Huntress, SIEM constitutes a “huge” opportunity for MSPs, Bisnett said. Key differentiators for the Huntress managed SIEM offering include using highly efficient data collection and retention techniques to keep costs predictable and minimal, which is crucial for service providers, he said.\n\n“It allows us to just drop out significant amounts of data that ultimately has little to no security relevance,” Bisnett said.\n\nAccording to one MSP and Huntress partner, the expansion by the vendor into SIEM is a welcome move, which is seeing Huntress bring the same streamlined approach to SIEM that it has previously to endpoint and Microsoft 365 security. The Huntress SIEM provides “one central location where we can calculate and collect a lot of our security data and metrics,” said Marcel Pawlowski, security engineer at Microtime Computers, an Andover, Mass.-based MSP.\n\nThe result, Pawlowski said, is that using the Huntress SIEM “really ups our digital forensics and incident response capabilities, while not being overly complicated.”\n\n‘Perfect Balance’\n\nGiven that Microtime has four people in its security and engineering department, the MSP isn’t able to staff a 24/7 security team, he noted. The Huntress SIEM provides a “perfect balance” to boost the MSP’s security operations capabilities with its level of staffing, according to Pawlowski.\n\n“I don't need to look at it every day. But at the same time, if an incident happens, I know the data is all there, it's accurate, the data sources are configured properly,” he said. “So it's everything that an MSP is looking for basically.”\n\nPawlowski said he has used a number of SIEM systems previously in his career, many of which were clunky and difficult to set up. During usage of the Huntress offering while in private beta, Microtime has found the SIEM to be a refreshing change, he said.\n\nIn particular, the user interface is “designed in a way that is very intuitive for somebody who hasn't used a SIEM before,” Pawlowski said. “The query mechanism is very simple. It uses a unified language that the documentation is very clear on. So it's effectively a pickup-and-go sort of solution. Anybody can do it.”\n\nThe launch of the Huntress managed SIEM offering follows the company’s June fundraise of $150 million aimed at accelerating its expansion into new product segments.\n\nIn addition to SIEM, the SMB-focused managed cybersecurity vendor is eyeing additional categories such as security posture management, as well as offerings that will “reinvent” data backup and recovery, Huntress Co-Founder and CEO Kyle Hanslovan told CRN previously.",

      "# [Huntress Releases First Public Tech Roadmap, Preps For Major SIEM Push by Joseph F. Kovar](https://www.crn.com/events/2025/huntress-releases-first-public-tech-roadmap-preps-for-major-siem-push)\n‘Nobody has really done SIEM in a way that's scalable in the MSP space to where, if you had to, you could flip a switch and turn it on tomorrow for all of your clients. Over the last three years, we've gone from about 50 percent of MSPs using SIEM internally to now about 80 percent. But of those MSPs who are using it, rarely do they get it out more than 10 percent of their clientele, and that's only because you get the ‘compliance hand raisers,’ the people who have to have it,’ says Jeremy Young, Huntress’ community growth strategist.\n\nHuntress, an SMB-focused managed cybersecurity vendor, has grown since its founding in 2016 to 450 employees, half of whom have been with the company for less than one year.\n\nNot a bad record for a company that was just one demo away from closing shop.\n\nJeremy Young, community growth strategist for Columbia, Md.-based Huntress, told an audience of MSPs at this week’s XChange 2025 conference that the company’s founders were close to shutting Huntress down in 2017 after not getting enough traction.\n\n[Related: Panelists Weigh In On AI, Security: ‘They’re Really Perfectly Intertwined’]\n\n“Honestly, they were broke that year,” Young said. “They decided to go all in at IT Nation, and [CEO and Co-founder Kyle Hanslovan] drove them from Washington, D.C., down to Orlando. [CTO and Co-founder Chris Bisnett] was writing a Windows hacking demo in the back of the car on the trip. To demonstrate it, they bought a TV from Best Buy that they returned after the show, because every penny counted. They ran that hacking Windows demo, and they won the Partner Choice award. That bet paid off. The leads they got converted from that show to revenue and allowed them to raise money.”\n\nAnd raise they did. Young said the company has raised $309 million and now has a valuation of over $1.5 billion.\n\n“While a lot of things have changed, a lot of things stay the same, and our founders are still here,” he said. “They’re still obsessed with the product. They’re still obsessed with making our partners the heroes, and the Huntress purpose, culture, and community-first approach have remained alive and well.”\n\nThe Huntress platform now includes four primary offerings, Young said:\n\nManaged EDR, or endpoint detection and response.\n\nManaged ITDR, or identity threat detection and response, which defends against identity-focused attacks.\n\nManaged security awareness training to help MSPs learn to avoid phishing attacks, malware, and so on.\n\nManaged SIEM, or security information and event management providing secure log storage, intuitive searches, and comprehensive reporting.\n\nHuntress’ managed SIEM technology, while still early in the development cycle, has come farther in the past few months than similar offerings from other vendors have come in the past few years, Young said.\n\n“Trust me when I say Huntress will be the affordable SIEM you need for 95 percent of your clientele,” he said. “Combined with managed EDR, ITDR, and SAT (security awareness training), this solution overall addresses compliance questions while adding security value without breaking the bank.”\n\nHuntress’ platform can also help MSPs and their clients achieve CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification) Level 2 compliance, and the company is working on its shared responsibility matrix, Young said.\n\nA CMMC Level 2 shared responsibility matrix delineates which security controls and responsibilities belong to the customer compliance versus those that belong to the service provider.\n\nYoung also said that the company is now making its platform available free of charge to MSPs for internal use.\n\nYoung later told CRN that Huntress has published its first public roadmap since the company was founded.\n\n“That’s part of the things that comes with scale,” he said. “We’re finally having enough products, people, and engineers so that every single offering has its own product management group.”\n\nPreviously, Huntress would have ideas for future products on its website that MSPs could vote on, Young said.\n\n“But we’re never given the whole, ‘Hey, here’s what we’re going to do in 2025,” he said.\n\nThe most important item on that roadmap is Huntress Managed SIEM, which the company started building in August, Young said.\n\n“It’s still in progress,” he said. “It’s available. But it’s not today where it's going to be in a year. Nobody has really done SIEM in a way that's scalable in the MSP space to where, if you had to, you could flip a switch and turn it on tomorrow for all of your clients. Over the last three years, we've gone from about 50 percent of MSPs using SIEM internally to now about 80 percent. But of those MSPs who are using it, rarely do they get it out more than 10 percent of their clientele, and that’s only because you get the ‘compliance hand raisers,’ the people who have to have it.”\n\nFor now, a lot of MSPs don’t believe SIEM is a necessity, so they're not going to push it, Young said.\n\n“This means adoption is going to stay in that realm,” he said. “Well, there's a lot of rising tides pointing you in the direction of, you need to have this for compliance. But there's nothing available that you can actually put across your clientele that's not going to drown you in alerts and that will not result in customers’ knee jerk reaction to say no because of the price. Huntress is going to be that solution for the 95 percent of clients that don't want to know understand the acronym SIEM.”\n\nThe data from implementing SIEM across a wide swath of MSP clients is also really beneficial for Huntress’ SOC, or security operations center, which can use the SIEM data to improve customer security, Young said.\n\nHuntress’ goal for all of its products is under 1 percent false positives, he said. Log data from EDR, ITDR, firewalls, and so on need to be correlated to have a higher confidence in detection of potential issues, and that data can be fed to the SIEM at no charge, he said.\n\nThat, combined with a recent feature that prevents the SOC from taking CUI (controlled unclassified information), makes Huntress’ platform more attractive for MSPs whose clients are concerned with compliance issues under CMMC, Young said.\n\nTony Balistrieri, CEO of TechhubPS, a San Diego-based MSP that often partners with other MSPs to help with their managed services, told CRN that the history of Huntress that Young presented shows how the company has evolved and where it is heading.\n\n“You can see that Huntress thought it through in terms of developing their technology as well as the company’s solid channel focus,” Balistrieri said. “Their final approach and their final model made it clear what Huntress was doing was built for channel companies. And they’re making their tools so that MSPs can really understand what they’re doing.”",

Huntress simplifies CMMC compliance: In a blog post yesterday, Huntress's Chris Henderson detailed a new Sensitive Data Mode, which blocks SOC access to potential controlled unclassified information (CUI) files without affecting security analysts’ ability to effectively detect and remediate threats. CMMC compliance is tricky for managed service providers, especially since the requirements have shifted over the past few years. This is a helpful tool that will help MSPs more easily ensure their clients' CMMC compliance and improve security.2. EDB boosts channel program: EDB is expanding its channel program to boost adoption of its Postgres-based database platform by more data analytics and AI applications. The company has also launched a new partner portal and a repository of vertical industry customer case studies that partners can draw on, EDB said.3. ConnectWise MSP threat report 2025: ConnectWise this week released its 2025 MSP threat report. The report, conducted by the ConnectWise Cyber Research Unit (CRU), analyzes millions of endpoint detection and response (EDR) and security information and event management (SIEM) alerts, to find emerging trends, attack vectors, and practical defenses. The 2025 report found significant shifts in ransomware tactics, including a focus on data extortion and smaller MSP targets, the rise of sophisticated EDR evasion techniques, and the persistent threat of drive-by attacks, among other findings.4. Google seeks new memory safety standards framework: Google is proposing a new technology-neutral memory safety standard framework to address memory safety vulnerabilities that elude secure-by-design principles, SC Media reports. The new framework would ensure improved data security while remaining compatible with currently available programming languages. Google has been pushing for improved data security by advancing Rust and other memory-safe programming languages and implementing a libC++ library. Memory safety measures will also be adopted by Google for its Go, Java, and Kotlin code libraries.5.

      "# [Cybersecurity firm flags attack on construction accounting system by Matthew Thibault on 2024-09-20](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/foundation-accounting-software-attack/727671/)\nDive Brief:\n\nEllicott City, Maryland-based cybersecurity firm Huntress has discovered an emerging threat for users of Foundation Software, which bills itself as serving 43,000 construction professionals nationwide. In a Sept. 17 report, Huntress said plumbing, HVAC, concrete and similar subcontractors were actively impacted.\n\nHuntress described the hack as a “brute force” attack, where perpetrators use an automated trial-and-error engine to guess credentials or other sensitive information. The affected companies were using default credentials — i.e., usernames and passwords that come with the software on purchase and that are supposed to be changed on installation — at the time of the intrusion, according to Huntress.\n\nHuntress discovered about 500 hosts running the Foundation software from the 3 million-plus endpoints it monitors for its clients, according to the report. From that pool, the company confirmed that a sample of 33 hosts were publicly exposed with unchanged default credentials. On one impacted host, it observed more than 35,000 brute force login attempts.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nFoundation told Construction Dive that some of the information in the Huntress report was inaccurate, and said that affected users were limited to clients still using legacy software physically installed at their own companies — i.e., on premise — rather than via Foundation’s hosted environment.\n\nThe impacted clients did not follow the protocol of changing their user ID and password, said Mike Ode, Foundation’s CEO, who noted the firm hosts the vast majority of its customers via its software-as-a-service offering.\n\n“If you buy a software and you install it at your place, you are responsible for the security and the walls and the perimeter, right?” Ode told Construction Dive. “We're responsible for what we've been selling for the last decade, and that's a hosted solution.”\n\nHe urged impacted firms to adopt hosted software instead.\n\n“We want everybody in our SaaS-hosted environment, right? Let us do it. Let us take on the responsibility,” Ode said. He asserted the attack mentioned in the report may have impacted just a single client, but acknowledged he didn’t know for certain.\n\nThe risks\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency has said use of default passwords is a major cybersecurity issue and has been urging organizations to reset them.\n\nEven though the intrusions occurred, there was no compromise or malicious activity on those computers, said John Hammond, principal security researcher at Huntress. Hammond said that to protect themselves, contractors who use the software should change their credentials, including passwords.\n\nHuntress noted that Foundation uses Microsoft SQL in its software. The combined platforms feature two high-privilege administrative accounts, dubbed “sa” and “dba” within the system. If their default credentials are left unchanged upon installation, perpetrators can have an easy entryway into the software.\n\nWhen contacted, Microsoft pointed Construction Dive to its SQL security best practices web page.\n\nFor a hacker, Hammond described the effort needed to breach the impacted instances of Foundation’s software as “trivial,” and likened it to typing in a password.\n\n“Once a threat actor finds an on-premise Foundation server, they could authenticate as the database administrator, and enable new settings to do whatever they might like on the whole computer,” Hammond said. “Candidly, it takes just one command to log in, and just two more to do real damage.”\n\nHammond said bad actors could access sensitive information, such as credentials or financial details, as well as gain entry into the computer itself.\n\n“This is a foothold and initial access vector into a whole network, with administrator privileges right out of the gate,” Hammond told Construction Dive via email. “In some cases we have observed the SQL server installed directly onto an organization's domain controller, which means it is immediate keys to the kingdom for the entire environment.”",

      "# [Advice for getting the \"Skilled Huntress\" achievement? by Shaddoll_Serpent on 2025-01-15](https://forums.bhvr.com/dead-by-daylight/discussion/436809/advice-for-getting-the-skilled-huntress-achievement)\nIt's even worse on PlayStation 5, you have to do it 100 times!\n\nI got in up to about 11 or 12 by making friends with survivors by having snowball fights during the Christmas event and high 5ing in the snowmen ect. Then when it's time to leave they normally realise what you want and let you down them and heal over and over in the exit gate for some free long range downs. You might be lucky enough in normal matches for a couple of survivor to give you a couple of hits for free at the end of matches and crawl out.\n\nUnless you are some sort of Huntress main god, this is probably the only way to do it.\n\nI would suggest:\n\nAnti healing add-ons/perks (E.g. Gift Of Pain).\n\nNurse's Calling (28m aura range, helps you find the distance).\n\nMonitor and Abuse (People tend to be a little more relaxed when they hear your Lullaby, but not your TR, and youre less likely to accidently \"lick\" them while looking for an angle for Nurses' Calling).\n\nFaster wind up add-ons for the fully charged throw.\n\nHex: Face the Darkness to help with interrupting heals for haemorrhage and finding people. The new Predator might also be good (haven't tried cause it wasn't there when I did it), but that might also help you get a few.\n\nAlso accept you're probably gonna have to prioritise ranged downs over winning. If you go it with a mindset of go for 8 hooks and let everyone leave, you will lower your MMR (which'll help), and you may even make friends with survivors who will let you get some for free.\n\nI got 14 hits legit, and then the PS4/PS5 trophy bug in 2024 gave me the rest... and while I was annoyed at some others is screwed up for me... tbh I wasn't at all sad about it for this one xD\n\nOther than that... sacrifice a goat to Imhotep and pray.",

      "# [All About Huntress Endpoint Detection and Response by Kirsty on 2025-02-20](https://www.ncs.cloud/news/all-about-huntress-endpoint-detection-and-response/)\nHello,\n\nThis week we’re looking at Huntress EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response).\n\nHuntress is a modern EDR software program which works alongside your usual anti -virus/anti-malware software.\n\nIt is powerful because it does things that normal anti-virus programs don’t do, such as:\n\nIt checks for Persistent Footholds – software that may have been planted or left behind months ago to lay in wait to attack the network.\n\nIt deploys Ransomware Canaries – small lightweight files that are monitored and then can be alerted immediately on any changes.\n\nIt links in with (and strengthens) Microsoft Defender so it can be managed in a single portal.\n\nThere is an External Recon platform which checks for open ports from devices on the network, identifying any potential weakness in firewall configurations.\n\nIt monitors process executions on PCs and laptops to build a comprehensive view of what’s happening in detail.\n\nIt has a 24/7 Threat Ops team monitoring and threat hunting on your network.\n\nThis video shows how Huntress works >\n\nHuntress also sends monthly reports which shows what has been analysed and if any incidents have been reported for the previous month.\n\nThe monthly report is interesting because it specifically covers the points above and explains them in more detail. See below example:\n\nIt is important to note the job of Huntress and similar MDR programs is to find and identify threats, then notify you and help you remediate the problem.\n\nThreat actors are actively targeting businesses like yours, and they’re getting better at sneaking into environments undetected.\n\nAs they evolve their offence, you need to evolve your defences and Huntress is a great way to do this for less than £5 per device per month.",

Kathryn Huntress, a student at Saint Joseph’s, will join 212 students from 39 states, Washington, D.C., and Mexico to form the 2021 cohort.\n\nThe Newman Civic Fellowship is a year-long program for students from Campus Compact member institutions. The students selected for the fellowship are leaders on their campuses who demonstrate a commitment to finding solutions for challenges facing communities locally, nationally, and internationally.\n\nKathryn is a social work student, a peer mentor, Academic Center for Excellence tutor, a resident advisor, and a member of the Class of 2022.\n\nThe fellowship is named for the late Frank Newman, one of Campus Compact’s founders, who was a tireless advocate for civic engagement in higher education. In the spirit of Dr. Newman’s leadership, Campus Compact member presidents and chancellors nominate student leaders from their campuses to be named Newman Civic Fellows.\n\n\"I first became involved with helping others when I was a high school student and volunteered for the Believe in Books Literacy Foundation. I had the opportunity to bring free books to children across Northern New England as the Bookmobile Coordinator, traveling to different preschools to read to children, and helping to collect donated books from the community. This opportunity allowed me to see how it is easy to take for granted small things, including access to books and education, and I found my passion for helping others.\" — Kathryn Huntress\n\nThrough the fellowship, Campus Compact provides Fellows with a variety of learning and networking opportunities that emphasize personal, professional, and civic growth. Each year, fellows participate in numerous virtual training and networking opportunities to help provide them with the skills and connections they need to create large-scale positive change. The cornerstone of the fellowship is the Annual Convening of Fellows, which offers intensive skill-building and networking over the course of two days. The fellowship also provides fellows with pathways to apply for exclusive scholarship and post-graduate opportunities.\n\n“We are proud to recognize these extraordinary student leaders and thrilled to engage with them,” said Campus Compact President Andrew Seligsohn. “The experience of the last year has driven home to all of us that we need open-minded, innovative, public-spirited thinkers and doers. That is what Campus Compact is about, and the stories of our Newman Civic Fellows demonstrate it's who they are.”\n\nLearn more at compact.org/newman-civic-fellowship.
