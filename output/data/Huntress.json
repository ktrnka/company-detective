      "# [Triangulation](https://www.huntress.com/blog/triangulation)\nOnce upon a time, I had my butt handed to me in a post-incident response debrief.\n\nI thought it was a good report. It was actually one of my first, many years ago.Â\n\nHowever, one or two executives in that debrief session began to question the credibility of the report. âWhy wasnât it one hundred pages?â, and âhow could you say for sure something happened during a window of time?â, and even âhow can we be sure youâve given this your full attention?âÂ\n\nSmelling blood in the water, one dissenting voice turned into a frenzy of sharks all trying to take a chunk of my derriere. The rest of that session was not spent explaining the nuance of their intrusion, but instead re-gaining the trust, credibility and confidence that my report had failed to instill in the client after their incident.Â\n\nAn unlucky constellation of factors meant one of my first IR reports was not well-received. Some of it was my inexperience and very apparent youth. A major failing was that I had not used the report to its full potential; I had failed to use the report to establish the impression of credibility in my reader.\n\nTriangulating for Credibility\n\nWe are intertwined in our incident reports, our summary of new zero-days, our Twitter threads.Â A bit of ego and vanity goes into technical writing, and any doubt about the efficacy of what we are writing is, by extension, a doubt of our credibility.\n\nI donât want you to flail at the first hit of criticism. Instead, I want you to protect your vanity and reputation by leaving your reader with zero doubt that you are an expert who makes well-founded, evidence-driven conclusions. With and through evidence, youâll be speaking with impeccable authority.\n\nTriangulation is an investigative concept from the social sciences we can kindly borrow and transpose. Here, the investigator enriches the validity and reliability of their claims by leveraging multiple methods and layering evidence from multiple sources of data that all speak to the same phenomenon.Â\n\nPut more specifically for infosec folk, triangulating involves using multiple sources of telemetry on a machine to hone in one theory at a time to disprove or prove it.Â\n\nAfter that terrible debrief session, I changed the way I wrote. Triangulation was one of many techniques I deployed to ensure a reader received (implicitly or explicitly) the impression that this report was as close to fact as possible, and I was an investigator of good repute and attentiveness.Â\n\nNow, you and I know that I am a clown (if not the whole circus) for most things, even if your only exposure to me has been through my blogs. But not when it comes to reportsâI mean business when I write reports. And I would like you to also mean business when you write your reports.Â\n\nI would like you to write technical reports that contain zero assumptions or assertions and instead act as your own first-layer peer-reviewer. You can triangulate your findings to corroborate your hypotheses, theories and ideas, and produce reports that convey unshakable confidence in your reader as well as contain technical excellence.Â\n\nTriangulation IRL\n\nWhen have I ever given you the recipe without bringing something fresh out the kitchen too? Weâll use a real case as an example of how triangulation can be used in real investigations.Â\n\nJust the other day, my colleague Cat Contillo and I found some spare time to do some honest security work. We had an alert come through that was a bit too vague for our liking, so we decided to flesh it out and make a report for the partner that had a good context with even better actionable findings.Â\n\nWeâre rarely so fortunate to have good security-enabled Windows Event logs on any given machine. On this occasion, Cat and I didnât find much from the logs, but we did leverage some digital forensic artefacts to mount our investigation from.Â\n\nThe alert we received was about potential lateral movement that ended up being PsExec. We could have just sent a generic report that did the bare minimum of communicating a threatâ¦.but thatâs not our style. Instead, we leveraged a number of data sources in order to tell a far more detailed, convincing story that offered the partner confidence in our report and our recommendations.\n\nTo triangulate PsExec, Iâll recreate our investigation and show you a couple of cool artefacts we can collect, contrast and compare:\n\nThe Windows registry data related to PsExec\n\nThe record from Background Activity Moderator (BAM)\n\nThe frequency of execution from PrefetchÂ\n\nA Moment on PsExec\n\nOur enquiry should lead with a good foundation of the phenomenon we want to study. So letâs dwell on PsExec for a moment.Â\n\nPsExec is a legitimate system administration tool as much as it is a tool for adversaries to laterally move in a domain. In our example for this article, when we launch PsExec from our host machine (Thornfield), weâre creating a remote session in the target machine (MoorHouse), and gain an interactive session with our âJEyreâ user.Â\n\nSimplified explanation. For greater detail, please read ExtraHops' blog post.\n\nAn unappreciated part of PsExec is the reciprocating agent that ephemerally appears on the target machine.\n\nMonitoring for PsExeSVC.exe to pop up somewhere in your environment is a great opportunity for detection. A PsExec connection will instigate an EventID 7045 (Service) on the target machineâs System.evtx for PsExeSVC. It will offer the connection time for us to focus on, as well as confirm the user account via SID (which Iâll show you how to convert in a minute).\n\nBut note, adversaries can control the service name by using the `-r` flag on PsExec, and is therefore not a foolproof method of detection.Â\n\nNow we have spent some time on PsExec and gathered ourselves a few basic facts about investigating, let's take it up a notch and see what artefacts we can triangulate to tell a fuller story.\n\nEULA Accepted in the Registry\n\nAttackers can try to change the name of the PsExec executable itself to evade detection, but something theyâre less likely to evade will be the impact on the Windows registry.Â\n\nWe can take a look in our registry for the EulaAccepted, which will appear with the value ofÂ â1â if PsExec has been dropped on this machine and the EULA pop-up has been accepted.\n\nWe can look across the registry from HKEY_USERS to identify which user accounts (via their SIDs) have leveraged PsExec.\n\nHKEY_USERS\\S-*\\Software\\Sysinternals\\PsExecÂ Â\n\nHowever, notice we donât get a corresponding username gifted to us. Instead, we get the long SID string. To convert that to a username, try this:\n\nâ\n\nOr over-engineer a solution!\n\nAn issue with wrapping up our investigation here and now is that we have no clue when the registry was changed / when and if PsExec was actually executed.\n\nIf a user account previously and legitimately used PsExec, that now brings into doubt the validity of assumption that THIS particular PsExec activity was the threat actor and was malicious.Â All we can conclude from the registry data is that PsExec has been on disk and associated with the JEyre account.Â\n\nBackground Activity Moderator (BAM)\n\nBackground Activity Moderator is an interesting source of telemetry, seemingly available from Windows 10 onwards.Â\n\nIâve heard claims BAM can ONLY be found on Win10 machines, but this is definitely not trueâthe data below has all been pulled from a Windows Server (Server 2022, Version 2009 Build 20348). However, I cannot claim to have any semblance of knowledge on exactly which OS, builds and versions BAM is and is not present for. ð¤·\n\nBAM is useful for illuminating the full path of an executed program, the time it was executed and the SID / user account associated with this execution. This offers us a layer of evidence different from that of the EULA Accept, which could tell us PsExec once existed under JEyre but couldnât offer a time.\n\nTo query BAM, youâve got two options:Â\n\nThe first is to simply manually look at the registry data. This can be messy and does not convert SIDs for you, but boy ainât it nice to get your hands dirty sometimes?\n\nThe second is to leverage Matthew Greenâs Get-BAMParser.ps1 PowerShell script, which includes a nicer format and converts SIDs to user accounts. I made a change request on this script so it would work with Server 2022.Â\n\nIf manual: you donât need a fancy script! Just good eyes. What we lose here, however, are timestamps.Â\n\nAnd if you use the script, be ready to ZOOM in. We get timestamps via the PowerShell script, which is a huge and necessary layer of evidence.\n\nAnalyzing BAMâs data on PsExec gives us the user account JEyre with the full path of execution. This is useful, as it corroborates what the EULA registry data stated about JEyre, and now we have specific directories that we can go and investigate to see if the threat actor dropped any other tools. Moreover, BAM offers a wider context of some activities that occurred, and we can start to contextualise what the threat actor did while they were in our environment.Â\n\nA limitation of BAM is that it trusts the executable name. If we rename it NotPsExec.exe that is how BAM will record it and report it back to us after parsing. Unlike checking the EULA registry data, which confirms PsExec was run and accepted, BAM goes off the sincerity of the executable name. Moreover, BAM offers little clarification on the frequency of execution. Is this the first time, or last time, or any time that the threat actor used JEyreâs account to PsExec?\n\nWe have a much clearer picture than when we started. But now we need to start gathering actionable information for our reader.\n\nPrefetch\n\nIâve spoken about prefetch before. It is automatically disabled on Windows Servers, but can be enabled with ease. If youâre unable to leverage prefetch to triangulate, might I suggest Amcache and Shimcache instead.Â\n\nYou can gain some early insight by looking in the prefetch directory on the host. Things executed will have a .PF file, but just looking at this directory alone is useful.\n\nÂ\n\nYou can pick up a .PF file and parse it using Eric Zimmermanâs PECmd tool:\n\nBy leveraging prefetch, we gain something quite interesting that we did not have before: precise frequency of execution. We are told that an executable called PsExec.exe ran six times, and the run times are put precisely. Moreover, from prefetch, we do not get a user account confirmed, but we do get insight on the directories referenced when PsExec was evoked.\n\nI say an executable called PsExec.exe, because prefetch is not able to qualify the executable name. Like BAM, it trusts the executable name and bases the recording of data from that name. So if this was renamed NotPsExec.exe, that is what we would see.Â\n\nHowever, name manipulation does not make prefetch data useless. We can continue to triangulate our findings by pivoting over to the target machine. In the targetâs prefetch directory, we can find record of PsExeSVC.exe: the reciprocating agent to PsExec.Â\n\nBy parsing PsExeSVCâs prefetch file, we get a more certain timestamp. This assumes the threat actor did not change the service name (as we have noted), but we can see a far much specific time that grounds our above six PsExec times from prefetch.\n\nAnd going full circle in our triangulation, we actually already saw this timestamp when we looked at EventID 7045âs in the System log of the target machine. Thus, we have near factual conclusions about the time of activity.Â\n\nA limitation of prefetch is that it first has to be present on the host, and second that it lacks the ability to attribute user accounts and is too trusting of the sincerity of executable names. But these flaws are addressed by the information in other telemetry we have leveraged, and moreover, we now have a better window of time that we can offer our reader for malicious activity.\n\nLayers of Evidence\n\nLike layers of Swiss cheese, the different sources of telemetry individually have gapsâbut combined, they make a more cohesive block; a more definitive, credible story is told once we amass and triangulate our data.Â\n\nOur report about the lateral movement has been nuanced by our triangulation. We were able to confirm the lateral movement was indeed Psexec via the 7045s in the System log, the data in the EULA and in BAM in the registry, as well as prefetch that added greater nuance about frequency and path location.Â Â\n\nBy triangulating these different sources of telemetry, and using each of their strengths to compensate their weaknesses, we gathered incredibly specific data that our readers can take action on. We corroborated the user account associated with PsExec (JEyre), we established the directories involved (C:\\Users\\JEyre\\Downloads\\PsTools), and established a window of time with (April 2022 April 4th 02:32 - 03:17 UTC).\n\nI hope Iâve successfully conveyed that triangulation is a worthy concept to stay conscious of during an investigation. Chances are youâre doing it already, and now you know a fancy word for it.Â\n\nThe point of triangulation isnât to prove the same things ten times over. The point of triangulation is to know the limitations of an individual digital forensic component, and to assemble a number of these artefacts to compensate and bring with them unique findings that add nuance to the phenomena we are investigating.Â\n\nWrapping Up\n\nWe all know that the executive summary on page one will be where most readers begin and end. We might want people to read our reports in their entirety. But we also want our readers to trust usâto trust our recommendations and findings from page one onwards.\n\nThrough triangulation, we can offer reports that are laden with actionable information for a reader to run withâand the confidence that we, the investigators, have reported as close to fact as possible.\n\nWe donât have to write verbosely to communicate our findings; itâs about specific language and certain phrases that demonstrate you are an investigator speaking with evidence-ordained authority on this matter. Maybe at some point, Iâll write about some of the particular vernacular I adopt when Iâm writing up reports (stay tuned). At any rate, I hope you enjoyed reading about triangulation, and I hope it saves your behind when you next have to report to a technical senior or executive.Â\n\nA major limitation of triangulation is that it requires the investigator to know and have access to multiple data sources that can all speak to a phenomenon they are studying. I donât have a good answer for this one I am afraidâyouâll just have to check out some of the material in the DFIR community and start leveling yourself! Or you can just keep following my articles on our Huntress blog. ð Why not both!?",

      "# [Huntress](https://www.huntress.com/platform/siem)\nSIEM, or security information and event management, was initially designed as a means to collect multiple disparate log sources and store the data under one centralized platform. Correlation rules took this one step further by adding a means to create alerts on the log data retrieved. Historically the use case for SIEM is built around: the collection/storage of logs, compliance, and threat visibility. The common problems with SIEM based on the âconsume all data'' approach are cost, training/skill to deploy and manage, and lastly, defining useful data from the noise.\n\nHuntress Managed SIEM was built from the ground up to solve the problem of data overload, unfiltered sources, and alert fatigue. Our Managed SIEM redefines the industry standard by applying Smart Filtering capabilities at the log source to only capture threat-specific logs. This simplifies the workload toward threat discovery and data retention. Managed SIEM is also built to collect Windows-based events and syslog using the same proprietary agent youâre familiar with. Supported by our AWS backend, your data is stored, safely and reliably.\n\nTraditional firewalls and antivirus is simply not enough. The time to discover incidents is about six months. Finding and targeting attackers quickly is only possible with a full picture of log data as a whole. SIEM creates a bird's eye view of log data to quickly identify an attacker's tracks using correlation analysis and Smart Filtering.\n\nThe Huntress team designed and built Smart Filtering from the ground up. While most vendors depend on the source (firewall, endpoint, router) to apply its own filters, we directly filter the log data using our proprietary filtering engine, acting as a sieve to collect only critical information from log sources.\n\nManaged SIEM can quickly integrate with existing infrastructure using the current Huntress EDR agent. Log data is captured using either the Huntress agent or Syslog collection and is forwarded to S3 in AWS for data storage. Searchable or âhot storageâ data is then relayed into Clickhouse for rapid visibility within the Huntress UI.\n\nWhile the Huntress EDR agent is designed for rapid response-based actions at the endpoint, our SIEM offering relays host Windows event and syslog data to our backend for further analysis and log storage. SIEM data is stored and hosted by the Huntress team for storage for up to a year by default.",

To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we collect or process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

Huntress doesn't really have visibility beyond endpoints today. This limited scope does create some blind spots and potential risks.  \n\n\nThey also don't really offer the ability to choose the vendor of your choice. So if you use S1 or Bitdefnder or another endpoint security product, they can't monitor it nor can their SOC to take response actions.\n\n#### Comment ID jzameiz with +5 score by [(m9832, Reddit, 2023-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/16ahw3s/whats_the_point_of_huntress/jzameiz/) (in reply to ID jz93jzy):\n>  Huntress doesn't really have visibility beyond endpoints today. \n\nYou should look at their MDR for 365 offering.

A very unique and important one.\n\nFor context, we run three EDR platforms on our managed endpoints. About a year ago we hired a penetration testing firm and had them run an assumed breach scenario to test our endpoint security. They had physical access to the machine and a user login. Halfway through the test period, we upgraded this to local admin account.\n\nWindows Defender is turned on with Defender for Endpoint P1 via M365 Business Premium license. For this test it was out of the box configuration on Microsoft's end, running recommended settings from Huntress. This was the first layer of defense and did well in blocking initial access attempts. Huntress caught and recorded, but did not alert on, the blocked attempts (this is intentional, thier systems are tuned to alert on active, live threats not blocked ones).\n\nTodyl EDR (custom, highly tuned Elastic/Endgame engine) kicked in as the second layer. Thier SOC alerted to the threatening activity and isolated the endpoint within 10 minutes. As a result of this testing, they now pull in and analyze alerts from Defender as well. \n\nHuntress is the backstop. The supporting and most important layer, in my opinion. Thier systems and SOC detect, alert and action on threats that have bypasses every other platform. Because they use whitelist-based methodology for persistent activity, they will catch those sneaky, manual attacks that slip by everyone else. For us, when Huntress alerts, it's an immediate all hands on deck, red alert, defcon 1 scenario. It means something is active on the system and has bypassed the blocking layers.\n\nHuntress can absolutely run standalone on a system alongside Defender and do a phenomenal job. They will catch all the bad things. That said, they are also not a full SOC/SIEM solution. If detailed or customized alerting is important, you should have additional defensive layers in place. This could be SentinelOne, Todyl, Crowdstrike, etc.\n\nThis doesn't even begin to touch the Huntress contributions to this community. They are always on top of the latest threats and actively hunting them across every endpoint. If something big is going down, your first notification will be from Huntress. They are the only security vendor who is willing to take intelligent, proactive action to protect thier clients. Such as deploying files or registry keys that block widespread attacks, as they did in the Kaseya breach.\n\nIf I was limited to a single security vendor, Huntress would be my choice.\n\n### Comment ID jz919p2 with +8 score by [(matt0_0, Reddit, 2023-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/16ahw3s/whats_the_point_of_huntress/jz919p2/) (in reply to ID jz86jeq):\nI acknowledge this is pretty nitpicky... but as far as I'm aware, this chart is still accurate\n\nhttps://tminus365.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pic2.png\n\nSuch that P1 (comes with M365 E3) is significantly less featured than Defender for Endpoint Business edition (comes with Business Premium).

We work great with S1, and we work great with just the free Defender out of the box.\n\n#### Comment ID jz7lyby with +4 score by [(Verum14, Reddit, 2023-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/16ahw3s/whats_the_point_of_huntress/jz7lyby/) (in reply to ID jz7i8ao):\n>I suspect this is due to the fact they didn't start offering Defender until very recently.\n\nI'm sure that is why *some people* ran S1, but those very same people could've ran Defender P1/P2/Bus alongside Huntress even without the integration. I think it's more just layered security. Having S1 and Huntress running alongside each other is always going to be better than having *either* S1 or Huntress\n\n## Comment ID jz9kqiy with +3 score by [(DevinSysAdmin, Reddit, 2023-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/16ahw3s/whats_the_point_of_huntress/jz9kqiy/) (in reply to ID 16ahw3s):\nHow is it not blatantly clear when you're on their website, what Huntress offers? https://www.huntress.com/platform\n\n### Comment ID jz9mly0 with +3 score by [(2_CLICK, Reddit, 2023-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/16ahw3s/whats_the_point_of_huntress/jz9mly0/) (in reply to ID jz9kqiy):\nMy man, if it was that clear then my post would’ve been downvoted just like all the \"which RMM?\" posts.

We have a number of clients that use both. When we address ransomware, we will sometimes ask the MSP to contact Huntress for a trial while we deploy SentinelOne Complete with DV and Vigilance SOC to see if Huntress can find fragments SentinelOne might not find, or the opposite.\n\nHaving two SOCs can certainly be a challenge when addressing incidents or operating day to day.\n\nIt's also pertinent to remember Vigilance SOC is a remediation SOC meaning they address the issues they discover. With their new release of Spotlight threat hunting, they've made the process far, far easier and my SOC guys certainly love it. There are some alternatives that work quite well. In the 5 years, and 30k endpoints we get from SentinelOne, all with the Vigilance SOC, we've not wanted for anything more. Perhaps a more integrated and affordable platform, which we are moving to. Even in complex ransomware incidents where we've deployed it, and other platforms, for remediation it's performed quite well.\n\nSo to summarize, You can operate with one or the other without missing too much. If you're dealing with a ransomware incident, then perhaps engaging both and a remediation team would make sense.\n\nIf you're looking for unbiased info on platforms, check out the Mitre Enginuity Caranabak/FIN7 Wizard Sandstorm ransomware tests where they provide the results and each sub-section findings in the open for all to see.\n\nIf you don't already attend the Huntress Tradefraft Tuesday webinars, I highly recommend them.\n\nIf you're looking for more 'all in one' options, take a look at Blackpoint Cyber as one alternative. There are a few 'all in one' solutions newly introduced to the channel that simplify providing cybersecurity to the end-client. Blackpoint is one. In our recent testing of Blackpoint, it did an impressively good job against the ransomware VMs we got from CISA and from other sources. Their Office365 security is also impressive.\n\n### Comment ID jz80gvd with +2 score by [(icedcougar, Reddit, 2023-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/16ahw3s/whats_the_point_of_huntress/jz80gvd/) (in reply to ID jz7gsnz):\nFew questions,\n\nSpotlight - is this for huntress or s1, as I’ve never heard of it unless you mean skylight (XDR)\n\nVigilance - when you say this do you mean vigilance or vigilance PRO\n\nIf you’ve used both vigilance and vigilance pro… what’s the real difference?\n\n(I use s1 complete, DV, skylight, vigilance, watchtower)\n\n#### Comment ID jz8g0nq with +2 score by [(FutureSafeMSSP, Reddit, 2023-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/16ahw3s/whats_the_point_of_huntress/jz8g0nq/) (in reply to ID jz80gvd):\nI meant Skylight.

Plus, for big events, Huntress actually gives a damn and calls their partners.  \n  \nI heard from TWO companies during the Kaseya breach, Huntress and Blackpoint. I wasn't even a partner at Huntress yet. I am now a partner of both and deploy both to various customers at my MSP. It's well worth having them on my side when something inevitably goes wrong.",

Each device is considered an endpoint, and you only get charged for the endpoints you have under management at the end of the month. There are additional discounts once you hit like 200 endpoints I think. It's volume based pricing so the more endpoints you eventually have the bigger of a discount you get. I like that there's no commitment though so if you have a client leave or you decide to stop using Huntress for that client in particular you could just remove the endpoints and not be charged.\n\n### Comment ID j5ev5ev with +1 score by [(riblueuser, Reddit, 2023-01-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/zhu51q/huntress_alternatives/j5ev5ev/) (in reply to ID izpjg1n):\nIs there any integration between S1 and Huntress?

Huntress also has their own built-in EDR that compliments Defender. It could be used standalone, standalone with Defender, or you can utilize it with S1 however they don't talk to each other.\n\nSentinel one does not really have a MDR. You either need to know how to use it or hire a company that does and they'll set it up for you. Once you set it up it needs to be periodically updated with the rules and file hashes but generally once set up requires minimal maintenance.\n\nThe reason we use both is because sometimes Huntress will catch something that S1 does not and vice versa.

This meant that if there were too many matches in a short time period, not all matches would be returned.

We're not seeing much innovation in that area: no firewall ingestion , no automated response capabilities beyond Microsoft Defender, etc. Is anyone feeling the same?\n\n### Comment ID kd553xc with +4 score by [(marqo09, Reddit, 2023-12-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd553xc/) (in reply to ID kd2kjmo):\nI don’t understand the negativity.\n\nWe’ve discovered and reported over 1,000 M365 incidents prior to the mentioned updates to the community we love and pour everything into.\n\nIMHO, Reid Hoffman nailed it when he said, “If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late.”\n\nAnother common product philosophy is “Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good.”\n\nAt Huntress, we ship and iterate until hackers are forced to change their tradecraft/go elsewhere. That means early versions of our products will have short-lived quirks and is why we always accompany them with early adopter pricing during this time—for being an early adopter.\n\nFor those not tracking, this is the same product philosophy that allowed us to stay agile and on top of every major SMB/MSP outbreak from 2015-Present. It’s key to staying ahead of threat actors [tight feedback loops](https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=698&v=AQfbPpkaq88&feature=youtu.be) and delaying for perfection is a dangerous precedent.\n\nKyle\n\n#### Comment ID kd6d6l3 with +4 score by [(BornConcentrate5571, Reddit, 2023-12-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd6d6l3/) (in reply to ID kd553xc):\nI agree.\n\nThe Huntress product suite is good.

Same account manager gave me a mid-tier discount without me even asking for one - called me up, said “thanks for being a customer” and offered.\n\nHuntress’s MDR for M365 costs SFA compared to alternatives. Like all products it’s gonna have bugs, even out of beta. It’s also gonna get better as a product because beta feedback is 99% “quash this bug” and “where’s the doco?”, real user feedback starts at real use, and if I know anything about Huntress and I think I do, they’re gonna load features into this thing that will make you cry from happiness.\n\n## Comment ID kd28a8i with +7 score by [(jackmusick, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd28a8i/) (in reply to ID 18gptkf):\nIt sounds like from #3, that means it considers impossible travel now, right?\n\n### Comment ID kd2g6m0 with +9 score by [(chrisbisnett, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd2g6m0/) (in reply to ID kd28a8i):\nWe are looking at the locations and trying to determine impossible travel.

We also have this capability, but early versions of it generated too many false positives so we disabled it. Our R&D team has been working on a new version that appears to have fewer false positives.\n\nI'll never say it's perfect or that we're going to detect impossible travel with 100% certainty, but we are evaluating these things and detecting malicious activity with what we have.\n\n#### Comment ID kd2t3xn with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd2t3xn/) (in reply to ID kd2g6m0):\nWhy are you building your own alert vs leveraging Microsoft built in Impossible Travel alert?\n\nafaik their system takes more into account then just velocity between locations using things like, browser version, time of day, resources accessed, machine ID, OS version etc to determine that you are you and that the machine you are using is reasonable for you to access and the fact that you are using a VPN to change your location or using a VM in Azure/AWS won't trigger their alert?\n\n### Comment ID kd2llw4 with +1 score by [(toabear, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd2llw4/) (in reply to ID kd28a8i):\nOne of my users got a VPN hit.

The fact that we were only seeing the first 100 matches for a detector wasn't obvious and didn't trigger until we started to bring on more partners to where we would have that many hits. We would have had a better chance of detecting this if we had built in more observability from the beginning, but it's always a tradeoff. Spending a lot of time on observability and ignoring features and onboarding customers doesn't get you much. It's about balancing the two. We're spending more time on observability stuff now to make sure we can identify any regressions in the future.\n\nWe would have liked to have some of these baked in from the beginning, but for most of these to work we had to build in the additional context and ingest data from third-party sources where they are the experts. To know if a user is logging in from a new location requires you to store and query all of the prior locations for the user, which we had to build out. Unlike other services, we didn't want our partners to have to go in and specify which countries or regions were allowed for thousands of M365 users. That's untenable. Other vendor solutions have hard-coded rules for things like M365 users outside of the U.S., which is also not going to work for a lot of folks. It took a bit of time to build these.\n\n### Comment ID kd2mozj with +4 score by [(evilmuffin99, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd2mozj/) (in reply to ID kd2fb4n):\nSome of that does make sense.

Usually this comes in the form of detections. If we feel that it can detect malicious activity, we want to get it in peoples hands so they can start using it and we can capture more data and with more data we can improve the detection capabilities.\n\nIn this case we were detecting things and sending incident reports and customers were largely happy. In cases where we had missed things during the beta we had adjusted and felt that we were now detecting those things. What surprised us was when we opened it up to general availability and started on-boarding more partners we found that with a larger sample size we had more things that we missed and we didn't iterate as fast as we should have on those to close those gaps.\n\nSo we felt like releasing this was going to help our partners find malicious activity within their M365 tenants, and that's why we moved forward with it.\n\n#### Comment ID kd4bqmt with +2 score by [(mpethe, Reddit, 2023-12-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd4bqmt/) (in reply to ID kd2mozj):\nI was definitely given the impression when I demo'd it that it was going to detect impossible travel type logins.

Since deploying, they have found a few minor incidents that required remediation and in each case provided a good explanation for what happened as well as steps to correct the issue.  The automated remediation is awesome but if you want to do things manually they provide steps to do that.\n\nMost recently, they were front and center working on the 3CX breach.  I had some machines with the vulnerable application installed.  I was notified of each impacted machine before any damage was done and I was able to quickly respond with removal scripts to eliminate the vulnerable software.  On top of that, my account rep reached out to me to make sure I was aware of the 3CX incident.\n\nOn the business side they have been great to deal with.  A few months ago my account rep reached out to me to offer a different tier, not advertised on the website, that was able to save me money.  After finding out that they can now bill in Canadian currency she worked diligently to revise my agreement which is also saving me money and making my costs predictable.\n\nPrior to using Huntress I was running S1, and it's a great product.  I have since fully migrated to Huntress with managed Defender and have had no regrets.  Knowing there is a competent team behind me helps me sleep at night.  I'm a small, one man MSP with around 200 endpoints but I've always felt like I'm just as important to them as any large customer.  Can't speak highly enough of them.\n\n### Comment ID jf3u3xj with +11 score by [(Abandoned_Brain, Reddit, 2023-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/12cunua/huntress_worth_the_money/jf3u3xj/) (in reply to ID jf3p9t3):\nOh, and don't forget they were all over the Veeam VBR vulnerability! The night that Veeam announced the fix for VBR v11 and v12 only, Huntress was sending out an email alert against each v10 install we still had at our client locations (sinful of us, yes, but we were assessing a move off Veeam at the time, and just hadn't made up our minds yet... and v12 was later than expected). \n\nAnd they recently added EDR capabilities to their service... at ZERO cost to clients.

We won the lottery and found a zero day the first week we spun it up via a lady who had a penchant for sketchy online games, so it was more of an immediate sell for us.\n\nEdit: I can't speak to other products.

The team there is one of the best (if not THE best) at what they do, and gives back to the security community in a huge way. They are absolute experts. Full stop.\n\nNow that being said, if you're happy with S1 and feel comfortable managing it on your own, probably not a lot to gain there. Where Huntress shines is managing it for you.

I feel really comfortable with both S1 and Huntress on machines.  I understand there is an additional cost with these though.\n\nAnother major thing to consider, like others have mentioned, is the incredible resource Huntress is for the entire community.  They do regular webinars with engineers which are a great resource to get on the pulse of what they are seeing.  And the response to pretty much every major incident over the last few years has been spearheaded by Huntress with real world data, expert advice, and remediations (which sometimes will be pushed automatically by them).  Your money and endpoints help keep that going.\n\nI feel like a Huntress evangelist or shill, but we are so lucky to have such an open, useful resource.\n\n### Comment ID jfapua4 with +1 score by [(Truman_IRL, Reddit, 2023-04-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/12cunua/huntress_worth_the_money/jfapua4/) (in reply to ID jf3na0t):\nWe just made the switch from S1 to Huntress and I agree they’re absolutely amazing.

You will not find a product that can perform how Huntress performs at anywhere near the price. In addition to its standalone capabilities, the ability to manage Defender is the cherry on top.  Easy deployment and ticketing integration makes it very set and forget.\n\nAlso included is External Recon. It uses Shodan to port scan every public IP an agent beacons from. This was an easy way for me to audit our clients to ensure that only required ports are exposed.\n\nMy only caveats..\n\nYou have to remember to manually map any new clients to the corresponding client in PSA.\n\nSeems easy to defeat (no anti-tamper) but no one is targeting it. By the time I ran a NLTEST and pinged a DC from a Huntress protected box, Huntress fired a ticket into PSA.\n\nIt provides a nice indicator of what machines Defender agents are borked on but fixing these is time-consuming---but this is more of a Defender issue.\n\nAs a co-managed SOC platform, Huntress' only action is host-isolate.. but in those critical instances.. it totally works. Ticket fires into PSA and you are getting a phone call from a Huntress engineer stepping you through what actions to take. \n\nAgain there are other more expensive SOC platforms out there that can take more actions but if you are doing a standard offering for your clients and an elevated security offering, Huntress fits right into that price/performance bracket for a standard offering.\n\n### Comment ID kpidiw1 with +2 score by [(hirs0009, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/12cunua/huntress_worth_the_money/kpidiw1/) (in reply to ID jf8wuqo):\nI just sat through a sale presentation and honestly it looks like the product is kind of a half measure with many holes.

Turns out that the router set up by the previous IT company had a port forward 3389 direct to the server.\n\nPutting aside the head-hanging shame of us not noticing this during the initial review (the onboarding tech cut off his little finger to reclaim his honour), we were surprised that Huntress didn't notice and flag the hundreds of failed admin login attempts. It was super obvious with about 200 attempts per hour for usernames like Administrator as well as admin, admintest, administrateur which I found it is what they call the admin account in France because of course they do.\n\nWe contacted Huntress and were told that Huntress does not, in fact, look at event logs. Rather, it's focus is on \"identifying threats and breaches\".\n\nHuntress is a great product that has flagged many useful things for us, however we really do need something that can evaluate logs and identify the sort of low-hanging fruit that attempted brute force attacks represent.\n\nSo my question here is should we add another product to our cybersecurity suite, or is there another product (SentinelOne? CrowdStrike?) that we can substitute in that will include a the things that Huntress does as well as log evaluation on endpoints and server?\n\n## Comment ID lj4qc8b with +23 score by [(Skrunky, Reddit, 2024-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1exb2eu/huntress_and_event_log_analysis/lj4qc8b/) (in reply to ID 1exb2eu):\nYou’re after a SIEM\n\n### Comment ID ljctyxv with +1 score by [(SlipPresent3433, Reddit, 2024-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1exb2eu/huntress_and_event_log_analysis/ljctyxv/) (in reply to ID lj4qc8b):\nNot quite.

Blumira is a full SIEM that's built for IT Admins. We've been a company for about 6 years and working with MSPs for about 3 years now and have experienced tremendous growth in that time given that we fill the void that the OP is talking about. We provide free-for-internal-use NFR licensing to MSPs of our full platform, and a free edition to protect your client's M365 environments. So feel free to [sign up](https://info.blumira.com/nfr) and protect your business.\n\nThere are a lot of SIEM-ish and SIEM-lite options in the space that will get you a part of the way there and a couple of them even add value. Knowing Huntress as well as I do, I'm sure they'll do a much better job than their competitors have at adding log monitoring in a meaningful way.\n\nI've been told for years now that XYZ SIEM-ish product or MSSP is going to be the next big thing. However, it hasn't yet come to fruition. As it turns out, it's very hard to build a full SIEM at scale, retain all logs ingested for a year, while keeping noise down, adding value to an IT audience, and remaining affordable enough for the SMB space. \n\nThe MSP/SMB market is very large and there will be those who want a SIEM add-on and those who want a full SIEM platform. There's room for both. So the main takeaway is to make sure you're doing something! Because without log-level visibility you're remaining in the dark.

We’re hoping to be able to use these events to identify when a risky rule is added or enabled so that we could notify you that someone added an RDP forward rule.

This is also a great example as to why things like risk-based alerting (exposed RDP, SSH, Telnet) is just as important as threat-based alerting.\n\nThis has been a growing topic broadly in /r/msp and /r/cybersecurity - adjacent to SIEM that is - this is a problem with solutions in-place in the industry and utilizing mature technology is important to realize the value you and your customers need. Looking at my data from Blumira I can see we have over 300GB of data on average per account for MSPs including Free (14 day retention only), not including free that increases to over 1TB of data per account. That data that makes up \"the rest\" becomes really important when not expected in the world of SIEM when looking at things outside the lens of immediate threat response. Throwing this data out due to usage pricing results in situations where threats, risks, or operational insights (failed disk alerting out of Application logs is a huge one) are often missed in our experience.\n\nWe love Huntress here at Blumira, in fact one of our strongest referral partners ahead of the Huntress release for MSP was Huntress - this of course I'm expecting to change as they move into delivering SIEM 😊. The Managed EDR/AV side of MSP needed to be disrupted and Huntress has done an amazing job penetrating the market and delivering outcomes broadly for MSPs. That being said - as someone who has built a SIEM - when I see any company jumping into SIEM I'm generally full of fear and terror for the engineers and security staff involved.\n\n-- CTO and Co-Founder of Blumira\n\n### Comment ID ljcvhrg with +1 score by [(SlipPresent3433, Reddit, 2024-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1exb2eu/huntress_and_event_log_analysis/ljcvhrg/) (in reply to ID lj9mivy):\nSiem answers the question of storing data but what happens with that data?

Having GB of data storage just means more detection engineering and normalisation work.\n\nThat's very true, my numbers are normalized data that's already gone through the detection stack, been decorated, and is storing the compressed version of the original log for IR purposes. I don't recommend looking for a SIEM that requires MSPs to do more work to make them work, implementing Splunk is a bad idea for example.\n\n>I think we are talking about actual outcomes of stopping the threat and most modern xdr tools (huntress is limited) do that. One doesn’t need to implement a siem\n\nXDR without a SIEM just opens you up to compliance answers to be solved in the future. We have our own XDR tier and even then I question the validity of where XDR has grown into the market. I look at XDR as the tactical response layer (response, automation, playbooks, case management, etc) on top of the Blumira SIEM. Other XDRs and MDRs do not take this approach and require you to solve your compliance needs outside of the platform - which further increases effort for organizations.\n\n## Comment ID lj4q3sa with +2 score by [(Steve_reddit1, Reddit, 2024-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1exb2eu/huntress_and_event_log_analysis/lj4q3sa/) (in reply to ID 1exb2eu):\nDoesn’t your RMM monitor events?\n\n### Comment ID lja9g50 with +1 score by [(Maureentxu, Reddit, 2024-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1exb2eu/huntress_and_event_log_analysis/lja9g50/) (in reply to ID lj4q3sa):\nMost RMMs do, although what OP is missing is a SIEM to receive the data.

So we held off demoing the others.

We monitor process events via our EDR and saw that a file that looked like a password-containing file was accessed by a user. We didn’t use anything special, purely just looking at files being accessed with password in the name.\n\nEdit 2: We appreciate the feedback!

I was thoroughly unimpressed with how unprofessional this person was. While nice enough, they didn't bother to ask me almost anything or engage in virtually any of the consultative selling dialogue we expect from vendors these days.\n\nHas anyone had similar experiences with Huntress' initial touch points? Are there just a bunch of Huntress shills on this board, or am I missing something? Considering how unimpressed I were with BOTH of the initial touches, I am not inclined to proceed with them, but I don't want to miss out if they truly have a stellar platform AND if they have good post-sales support.\n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: please see below for a very positive update!\n\n## Comment ID jbq8c0o with +36 score by [(OIT_Ray, Reddit, 2023-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbq8c0o/) (in reply to ID 11o1h1t):\nI'm not trying to minimalize your experience.

We use a round robin model vs a territory model, meaning when you ask to speak with the team the first thing we need to figure out is which team you would be working with. Off the top of my head, I believe the lines we draw are 0-49 endpoints, 50 - 749 endpoints, 750 - 1,999 endpoints, and 2,000+ endpoints. Once they identify which bucket you fall into, they would schedule a meeting with a rep and a sales engineer. \n\nI'll let others speak to their experience working with our team (both pre and post sales) but I'm super bummed to hear you didn't have a good first experience.

We had a new customer during the trial that had remnants of ransomware that it removed.\n\n\\- Can remove AV costs (not Sentinel One or Crowdstrike).  If you are paying for another AV and think Defender is a reasonable AV it is a viable option.\n\n\\- No constant / useless alerts.\n\n\\- Very little babysitting is required.  This solution requires very little tech time.\n\n\\- Emailed reports for agents that haven't checked in and other things that let you know the solution is still in.\n\n\\- Very straightforward pricing and contracts.  Really, this is what we want all vendors to do but few actually do.\n\n\\- They legitimately are out there helping MSPs enhance their security (neighborhood watch is a great example of this).  It isn't the disingenuous \"help\" where they say \"we want to help you grow\" crap we hear from every other vendor as they try to convince us their product will add revenue with no / little work!\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- Integration with RMMs is still a little light.\n\n\\- Like all security software, you want it to do something to justify the cost in your head but also don't want the security event.  It helps if it is also the AV replacement.\n\n\\- They don't play \"let's make a deal\".  Now this is in direct conflict with the pros, but it is something I am used to.  I rake ever vendor over the coals to get the best possible pricing / deal.  It was almost offensive that they wouldn't make any concessions!  Messed up I know because I don't want my customers trying it with me...  What can I say?  I am the product of a predatory vendor channel!!!\n\n\\- That last price increase was painful and borderline crazy.  It moved the product from a no-brainer to something you have to ensure there was no duplication for (replace lower AVs and such).  I have been told that their price increases are rare, but it was still a hell of a jump.  While they announced it all at the same time, it was still 25% in 2022 and 20% for this year.  (Quick note here - this isn't to say that the price increase isn't warranted.  They have crazy good support and security analysts.  Anytime prices go up that much though, it is still a \"Con\")\n\n## Comment ID jbrup0s with +8 score by [(wireditfellow, Reddit, 2023-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbrup0s/) (in reply to ID 11o1h1t):\nNice try Kaseya.\n\n## Comment ID jbrp0ke with +4 score by [(OnAKnowledgeQuest, Reddit, 2023-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbrp0ke/) (in reply to ID 11o1h1t):\nCurrent Huntress customer so take this with a grain of salt.

Depending on your settings they will isolate the host to prevent spread across other network devices. If a device is isolated they will call the contact number on the account. When an endpoint is isolated it can only communicate with Huntress. The email you receive contains detailed information on the incident and provides information regarding found foot holds and IOCs, it also provides detailed recommended remediation steps. What’s really handy is the automated approved remediation process, if you decide the recommended remediations are enough, you click a button and huntress does the rest, you even get to choose if you want to reboot the endpoint manually or let huntress reboot the machine. Huntress has stopped at least 3 ransomeware incidents from occurring on client machines that had other endpoint protection software (webroot(yuck)) was not alerted. You can also see from the dashboard processes that are actively being investigated by security analysts, and a ton of helpful details about what’s going on on endpoints. I guess the most important thing to remember when a incident occurs and huntress alerts you is trust but verify. Don’t always go with the automated remediations, if you do, manually go through the machine to check for other footholds or iocs. Nuke the machine if it’s serious. Let me know if you have other questions.\n\n#### Comment ID jbsmyu2 with +5 score by [(bazjoe, Reddit, 2023-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbsmyu2/) (in reply to ID jbrrmbl):\nCheap, good, fast -pick one … Huntress solidly gets all three done for proactive response.

We had a machine download and attempt Mimcatz install, it got caught by Defender which policies blocked any executables from running until cleaned, and Huntress auto isolated the device from the rest of the internet, so we were unable to remove the isolation from Huntress due to the defender policy denying executions, and we couldn’t reach the 365 servers to remove that block.

We had an active brute force attack happening & figured it was a bigger issue as we were watching it happen on CONSOLE. \n\nSome of this comes down to expectations vs what was really going to happen. I believe the expectation from us was to just send an email and wait for a response. We thought since this is 'real people' looking at things then we could talk to someone. We ended up calling our sales rep who then called around and called back saying someone was looking into it. No more information could be provided. This entire time we are watching the brute force continue. This was about 15minutes into the 'attack' at this point and we just shut down the server while we waited on a response. It was roughly 15 minutes after that we got a response that everything looked good and there wasn't enough failed login attempts to warrant a flag.\n\nWe booted that server back up... and it continued. So who do you trust? Huntress or your console your actively watching be brute forced.\n\nSo the experience of an emergency defiantly did not leave us feeling good. However we do now have a better idea of what to expect. \n\nFor those of you still reading, wondering about the resolution? Well it turns out if you paste a notepad in a password field, even with restarting CW Control sessions multiple times, it will still just keep going. So it was technically both not a real hack attempt, and a legit brute force, regardless of the cause.\n\n### Comment ID jbqrync with +1 score by [(DevinSysAdmin, Reddit, 2023-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbqrync/) (in reply to ID jbqrc6o):\n🤦‍♂️\n\n#### Comment ID jbr6mwu with +1 score by [(enuro12, Reddit, 2023-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbr6mwu/) (in reply to ID jbqrync):\nA couple more of those and a couple pikachu emoji's and you've got the entire postmortem in a nut shell.\n\n### Comment ID jbqs0b4 with +1 score by [(andrew-huntress, Reddit, 2023-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbqs0b4/) (in reply to ID jbqrc6o):\nIf you have any info on this (support ticket number, rough date on when it took place) I’d be interested in taking a look at this.

I just logged into the huntress portal and still don't see any way to contact help other than leaving a message in the chat bot.

I signed up for the free trial and was contacted via email by a rep who asked me how many endpoints and whether we were looking for direct buy or working through an MSP. When I said direct and about 115 endpoints, it took 3 days to get a response.\n\nAt that time, I was told they weren't interested in direct sales for less than 200 endpoints and was asked if I wanted to talk to be put in touch with an MSP. Well, not really, but if something could be worked out just to buy the licensing then maybe so I told her yes. She then copied me into an email with an MSP in Michigan while we're based in North Carolina. That Michigan person emailed me a link to his calendar to choose a time where he could then give me his pitch. No thanks.\n\nSo I emailed back the Huntress rep one more time and let her know we are adding an additional location in 2024 which should bring us up to about the 200 minimum and asked for more info, like pricing, etc. That was May 18 and I haven't heard a word back from her.\n\nMoving on to look at other solutions.

It's fast to setup, easy to manage and the training content is good - great. My $.02 is that they are more focused on the ease of initial customer setup, automating campaign management, and new user intro's, etc. I really like the ability to add your own content and have it wrapped up in the LMS like the included content.

As long as people engage with the training, that's what matters to the customers. My opinion of the content isn't that important, as long as the content hits on the most common subjects. I think slick content might be what sells MSP's on a platform.

We just had an occurrence the other day and the way it was handled was not what I was expecting (probably my fault) or one that i cared for. Good news, nothing happened and we were working at 6am when the alert came thru so we disabled the M365 account in question and did our due diligence. Anyways,  \n\n So I am looking for some other MSPs advice on utilizing BlackPoint Cyber with Cloud Response as opposed to Huntress.  The example below is why I am looking for our firm and trying to decide if its the best solution for all of our clients. \n\n6:03am EST, Huntress alert via email regarding an M365 account the was logged into successfully from another country and also using an Express VPN client.  This firm in particular uses M365 accounts to access their companies data shares so this was a high potential for disaster.\n\n Account was not auto disabled , just this alert.  This alone did not sit well with me. In the overall scheme, if 3000 users are working fine and just 1 user gets locked out of their account as a security measure, then all is well in the world ... to just alert us via email simply reminded me exactly of the commercial on TV were a bank is being robbed and the security guard tells the customer \"Oh the bank is being robbed\" and the customer says \" Then stop them, do something\" in which he replies \" Oh no, I don't actually DO anything, I just tell you your being robbed\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n So fast forward to now and I see BP Cyber in Pax8, Read about it, demo it and it seems to be great BUT a demo means nothing when it comes to security I really just want to get some others input on utilizing BP with S1 over Huntress with S1and if you have done this how has the SOC been and do they seem very interactive?  I can say I love the random email alerts just letting us know about \"user X logged in from Y or User X changed a rule\" etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, I actually like Huntress a lot, they have some great communities and employees. I just need to know I can go to bed and if something happens at 3am I can deal with a locked account in the morning instead of a malware attack.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nthanks for your input!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Comment ID kqzfi1d with +28 score by [(giantsnyy1, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqzfi1d/) (in reply to ID 1atjpws):\nSo I actually had this happen to me with Blackpoint.  New client, just enrolled, still in the process of setting up policies, turning on MFA, etc.\n\nBefore I even got a notification email that the user logged in from Nigeria, I received a phone call from the Blackpoint SOC stating that they blocked the user account and signed them out of all 365 instances.\n\nI received the automated email a few seconds after I hung up the call.\n\nThat alone let me know that blackpoint was the best option to go with.\n\n### Comment ID kri6qct with +3 score by [(Lilcute, Reddit, 2024-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kri6qct/) (in reply to ID kqzfi1d):\nThis\n\n## Comment ID kqyhu20 with +56 score by [(max-huntress, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqyhu20/) (in reply to ID 1atjpws):\nHi /u/cassini12! I'm the director of the SOC at Huntress. Feedback like this is helping us iterate aggressively on our approach and feature development. As of this past Friday, we are now using our new identity baselining technology to lay the ban hammer on certain M365 logins.\n\nWith this new tech, we consider accounts with at least 30 days of activity as \"***baselined***\". If we see a *baselined* account use a VPN provider for the first time, we send a ***Critical report, isolate the account, and kill the user sessions.***\n\nFor identities that don't yet have 30 days of data, we send a High report and do not isolate the account. This prevents a scenario where you deploy Huntress to an org using VPNs widely and  they all lose access to M365 until the MSP can respond.\n\nKeep in mind, should an attacker log into an un-baselined account from a VPN and trip any one of our additional detections for likely business email compromise/M365 attacker tradecraft, we'll immediately send a critical report and **isolate the account at that point.** We try to have multiple places in the attacker lifecycle to catch the attacker.  \n\\---  \nThings on our mind:\n\n* Consider reducing the baseline time from 30 days to 7 days.\n* Engage with partners to understand if they'd still prefer new identities to be isolated as well.\n\nHere is a [post from the other side of this debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1al67bw/huntress_new_m365_ip_detections_for_vpns_and/) earlier this month. It's a challenging balance but we're all in on creating innovative ways to solve it.\n\n**I can confidently say you have our ear** and we're having these exact conversations internally every week. We're iterating quickly based on real MSP feedback. If you're open to it, shoot me an email with your MSP name and I'll review this incident in depth to see if recent/upcoming changes would have modified the outcome here: [max.rogers@huntresslabs.com](mailto:max.rogers@huntresslabs.com)\n\n### Comment ID kqzmp1k with +10 score by [(RaNdomMSPPro, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqzmp1k/) (in reply to ID kqyhu20):\nThanks for weighing in. We’d like to see the option to just block any login activities from a vpn, per client would be ideal. I know you’re working towards more automated remediation vs. alert and the msp handles (problematic if you don’t staff 24x7) it’s generally ok to isolate and let us pickup the pieces, better than the alternative. Also, and I've suggested to huntress, incorporate the huntress agent presence as an extra trust check for customers using huntress edr too. Or integrate with common rmms for same effect to better evaluate things. Once you guys add some ms365 posture management capabilities (just buy Simeon cloud) you’ll be leading instead of following on the cloud mdr front.  \n\nThe comparison between huntress and BlackPoint isn’t exactly fair - to use BP cloud mdr, you’re already on their MDR and SOC services, in essence you’re already paying for the SOC team to manage 365 events too. BP has some of the same limitations tho, they have a top 30 (or whatever it is now) events they detect and respond to. A starting point that will no doubt improve. Posture management is just ok unless there has need a major innovation recently.\n\nEither vendor is a good decision, but one is about 4x the cost, so keep that in mind.\nedits to fix spelling.\n\n### Comment ID kr00vac with +5 score by [(Crshjnke, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kr00vac/) (in reply to ID kqyhu20):\nOr why not let the client pick what happens with high alerts per customer?

We know from experience that customization and configurability contribute greatly to misconfigurations and move away from \"secure by default\".   \n\n\nWe think a big part of Huntress' success is that you really can't use our products incorrectly.  \n\n\nI can see a world where the product starts at \"secure by default\" but can be put into an even more aggressive mode. We build products ***with*** MSPs not just for them.

Specifically locking 365 accounts that were compromised. EVERYTIME something has happened, they have had the account locked in less than 15 minutes. \n\nThat being said, a non-us logins conditional access policy is the best defense for that.

Huntress has had an amazing reputation as a company around here for a while. And it’s clear you guys have a no BS approach to business. But when you guys started taking PE/VC money the community voiced concerns that product quality would drop in the forced pursuit of revenue. And then the M365 product was pushed out the door and AMs started pushing it hard to partners, and over the last 6 months it’s become apparent that the product was not finished and still isn’t finished, its lead to a false sense of security. It seems reasonable to conclude the product launch was rushed to chase revenue to appease the investors. I also haven’t seen much innovation on Curricula.  I really really hope this has been a wake up call to you guys because before any product you announced was a no brainer because I trusted the company, that’s eroding for me.\n\n#### Comment ID kr12v2v with +4 score by [(After_Working, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kr12v2v/) (in reply to ID kqyc4sq):\nI went big into MDR, realised it wasn’t doing much so pulled 1500 seats back to Sophos MDR.

It wasn’t a even a month after starting with them, one of our techs installed an app to remove hidden accounts from his computer and locked him out in seconds then I get a phone call while listening to the tech freak out his computer won’t do anything. It was awesome. Since then I setup M365 monitoring and application blacklisting. Couldn’t be happier with their offerings. They continue to build on their stack with thought out and useful tools and alerts. \n\nLock it down then alert is the only way. We spoke with a few other SOCs and they all alert first and if they don’t get you on the phone, they wait until they do.

BPC has caught for us, in the last two months:\n\n* Someone that was cheating a CA policy with a VPN.\n* Clients with VPN issues, VPS issues\n* Three impossible travel scenarios.\n* Four MFA bypass attacks with full Conditional Access in place (with number matching and GeoFiltering)\n* Several false positives on endpoints that were related to admittedly suspicious Powershell.\n\nLook, I won't say everything's perfect (and they 100% know who this is, by my Reddit name - Hi Britt, Will, Xav, Jon, Mo...), their portal needs *work*, for example, but damn if they aren't responsive as hell and actively developing for the MSP community. I'll have a testimonial out for their SOC (which is... spectacular and knowledgable) at Right of Boom in a few weeks.\n\nI've had to move some stuff along occasionally, and I am 100% sure their team is sick of my crap, but... I *really* do not want to leave them. I'm feeling like we won't, and if we were, it 100% wouldn't be technical - I have much faith in their SOC, both the endpoint agent and the 365 monitoring.\n\nWhen I looked at Huntress, they were equally amazing and powerful. We didn't choose them for two reasons:\n\n* I don't need Process Insights (their EDR). Our clients use the highest rated, best performing EDR - Defender.\n* It was very clear to me after *several* meetings (Again, I love what they do for the community, and their team is very obviously top notch, so I really did try with Huntress) that they would only send recommendations, not take action besides isolation. This may very well have changed, of course, but that was the case last year.\n\nBoth are awesome - BPC is more expensive and I believe it to be more fully featured. I'll happily answer more questions around here too - feel free to check out my post history, I work for an MSP, not for either org.\n\n### Comment ID kqy4i75 with +2 score by [(cassini12, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqy4i75/) (in reply to ID kqy1xoq):\nThank you for your great answer! Makes me feel like I am not alone in my thinking or expectations from a SOC. It seems almost very surprising that a company as \"together\" as Huntress would allow for such a hands off approach.\n\nI will more than likely move my clients to BP. I do have a question for you regarding your statement on EDR. A few webinars with Huntress in fact that I attended very much echoed your sentiment about the best EDR being Defender. Since my clients are almost all Business Prem licensed we have been toying with the idea of ditching  Sentinel One and just using Defender. (example: BP Snap + Cloud Response + Defender)  Is this what you are doing for day to day security? I will admit we roll with S1/Huntress as its pretty much set and forget and I was under the impression that Defender would require a decent amount of \"configuring\" before it was at the same level? Your thoughts?

MDE is massively powerful and has things like Attack Surface Reduction, etc, and a ton of vulnerability stuff. It's immediately as good as S1 (turn on tamper protection), and can be *much* more deeply integrated in Windows... because Microsoft :)\n\n#### Comment ID kr00k5g with +4 score by [(jpete99, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kr00k5g/) (in reply to ID kqy4i75):\nHuntress costs significantly less than BP. Their slogan is \"security for the 99%\" and that means there are a few tradeoffs. It may not be a fit for you, but I would try to keep this in mind when comparing how Huntress and BP handle response.\n\nIn our case, we've been able to deploy Huntress to 100% of our clients and that wouldn't have been possible with BP.\n\n## Comment ID kqzc0yi with +5 score by [(jhartnerd123, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqzc0yi/) (in reply to ID 1atjpws):\nMy MSP/MSSP also uses BP and we have also now been fully implementing their Google Workspace integrations.

I know, testing is extremely difficult, but we have had many discussions and invested so many hours, looking at the solutions, carried out ransomware testing on VMs, etc. That was about half a year ago and Blackpoint cut the best figure. Both in terms of know-how and the solution itself. Many solutions such as Arctic Wolf etc. simply fall through the net because they only send an email saying \"hey there's something, take a look\" but that doesn't help us if it's at 3 a.m. and we're all sleeping like babies... \n\nThe M365 integration is also extremely important, as we are an MS Shop and work with Defender for Endpoint, Servers. \n\nIn the end, we and our customers (the internal IT management) were convinced by the maturity of the product as well as the processes undertaken by BP. Laura as well as Mo (hi there) were also able to help us close a huge deal with one of our larger customers. \n\nSince implementing BP they have blocked several logins etc. Even though we have CA policies and follow best practices you never have a guarantee and that is what Blackpoint is for. \nSecurity is like an onion, you have to look at it in layers and layers, and one of them is a SOC these days but is never a guarantee.\n\n## Comment ID kqxxxfi with +9 score by [(brokerceej, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqxxxfi/) (in reply to ID 1atjpws):\nWe've been using Blackpoint since they were a small shop.

Its one person, i don't actually care if its 10 just do it and then we re-enable them but at least we get eyes on it before it spreads.\n\n## Comment ID kqydy97 with +2 score by [(Lastsight2015, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqydy97/) (in reply to ID 1atjpws):\nInfrequent country and Impossible travel are 2 alert policies you can configure and enable in M365 Defender for cloud Apps to email only or email and sign-in block the account.\n\n### Comment ID kr01ci4 with +1 score by [(P-T365-msp, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kr01ci4/) (in reply to ID kqydy97):\nIf a malicious actor gains admin access to the tenant, these alerts can be disabled by said actor.\n\n#### Comment ID kr11mvh with +3 score by [(Lastsight2015, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kr11mvh/) (in reply to ID kr01ci4):\nLet’s not get into how you should be securing other areas of your M365.

Even going through PAX8 you need to check to ensure monthly that you are being billed the correct amount of overages for both devices and licensed users. Device commitments will go up if you don’t decommission machines from BP. This includes renamed or reimaged devices. Also they go by licensed users for M365 and this will include Microsoft Teams resource accounts or any other licensed user that doesn’t have a mailbox. Their billing has been a nightmare for us and we are constantly requesting them to credit us. The SOC is great, but the UI is very buggy and the billing is a nightmare.\n\n## Comment ID kqxxon8 with +6 score by [(johnsonflix, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqxxon8/) (in reply to ID 1atjpws):\nI have ran them both.

Still getting 2-3 alerts per week for personal vpns, its crazy to me how many people have them on their phones. Ive heard the same from Bp msps.

C suite specifically asked internal IT if they could get a direct quote instead of going through us and then just pay us a management fee. BP was full aware they had an MSP but told them they are close enough to SMB where they could sell direct. Internal IT told me as just a heads up BP has no problem selling to us. We were unaware BP operated like that. Some back and forth and unhappy calls later and we’re trying out Perch now. We didn’t have a whole lot of clients with the service and we’re already in the ConnectWise environment so it was an easy transition over. Still very recent so don’t have a lot on Perch yet in application.\n\n## Comment ID kqyz3ki with +1 score by [(LucyEmerald, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqyz3ki/) (in reply to ID 1atjpws):\nHaha you every sales team dream\n\n## Comment ID kqz1u99 with +1 score by [(lenovoguy, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqz1u99/) (in reply to ID 1atjpws):\nOur huntress is coming up for renewal, and I was thinking of just moving everyone to BP as well, but as far as I know I don’t think cloud response will lock the account, I could be wrong\n\n### Comment ID kqz7syo with +4 score by [(it_fanatic, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqz7syo/) (in reply to ID kqz1u99):\nYou are completely wrong - they do, if there is enough evidence.

When your sole focus is numbers, people get left behind, forgotten, and abruptly let go. Everyone is terrified for lack of job security and most are trying to find roles elsewhere. In addition, promotions are scarce at best. The most deserving wait years to potentially get promoted, most are still stagnant in their roles while outside hires supersede them. The Huntress product development also was top notch. Recently, the company decided to focus only on sales and encouraged the sales teams to promote products that were not ready. Anyone that challenged this approach was quickly silenced. Care for your employees and product is crucial to success and without it, the company will never be a place I would recommend to anyone.",

          "cons": "I am loathe to have to write this, but I feel like I have to warn prospects and current leaders about the culture at the company (doubt they'll care). Huntress is succeeding despite it's best efforts to sabotage itself. And I want it to succeed.\n\nHuntress's culture has declined to the point that the direction of the company is in the balance. Employees no longer have any loyalty, because of a lack of a feeling of job security. Loyalty and pride used to be main drivers behind employee morale. The pride everyone used to have is waning, as they realize the company does not care about them at all. Employees are feeling like they're just a cog in the wheel.\n\nThe company cycles through leaders in all departments so quickly that there is no loyalty or feeling of job security. Every department's leadership has cycled numerous times in just a few years, except the one that needs a refresh. Once leaders leave, the current employees are no longer supported by the new crew, and many often are cycled out also.\n\nThe company is led by founders without business chops or background. If you don't play their bro game, you're out. They are executing a playbook to cycle out leaders every 12-18 months, a strategy that may have benefits in the short term, but destroys culture and morale. The founders have no clue how to lead or what is needed at each position, and it shows. No sophisticated leader would follow this juvenile strategy. \n\nWhile I do not think it's intentional, the leadership style by the founders is that of fear. Yes, it's their company (although now at Series D, they have board bosses that should step in). Look, the founders had a great idea, designed a sweet product, and built a good company. But, they have not evolved as leaders with the stage of the company. Instead of seeing that, the problem is always someone else. Nobody ever meets their standards, communication is ineffective or nonexistent, and role definitions change or are misunderstood. Instead of bringing people along and up, the founders lead by fear and cycle out bodies for the new shiny toy. Really great, super qualified employees are not up-leveled or refreshed to retain them-the company mindset is apparently we can just go get someone else. Everyone is afraid to disagree or to take initiative, as it's always \"wrong.\" Beloved leaders and employees are being purged for \"the next stage\" -- a next stage that nobody seems to understand. \n\nImportantly, no one feels like they'll be a part of the future they talk about. When founders talk about massive future growth, the eye rolls start as most do not think they'll be a part of it. If the company ever goes public, it will likely do so without anyone who was a part of its growth stages. That is jarring. Only the founders will ring that bell. Other leaders who have the background, chops, and institutional knowledge will have left a company they help grow gangbusters. It's bonkers.\n\nThe culture has suffered. Almost everyone is actively looking for positions elsewhere, and aren't even quiet about it--from those here 6 months to those with 4 years behind them. Largely because they just don't know when they'll get the boot, and the constant stress of long hours and unknown as to whether it's enough (it never is).\n\nIf they did an actual anonymous poll, instead of one where replies can be tracked back (data broken down so granular is not anonymous), they'd get more candid feedback.\n\nFinally, do not believe all of the glowing reviews--the company incentivized people to positively review. \n\nYes, outwardly the branding is cool and the products kick butt. But inwardly, culture is toxic and future perceptions are bleak.\n\nSmoke and mirrors.\n\nThe company needs a pause and reset.",

I am sorry that your experience and thoughts about Huntress are so bleak. \n\nYou raise multiple points and we fully appreciate that they reflect your feelings.  No one can argue or dismiss those.  We noted this post was also cross-posted to Reddit, so the feelings are clearly real and strong.    \n\nWe love transparency and appreciate that Glassdoor asks both teammates and the company to share perspectives.  So we would be remiss to not share some data (which we share with radical transparency at monthly all-company Town Halls so our teammates can personally track the details) and reactions-\n-\tAttrition rates for the year are in the single digits, and trending down. Headcount has grown 2x in the last two years, and we are planning for the same in the next two, because . . . \n-\tEach of our four products are growing at industry-leading rates, and current customer revenue retention rates are a world-class 140%. Suffice to say, our Product dev team is second to none, and, the Huntress secret sauce to developing differentiated, high-value, managed solutions continues to sustain our hyper-growth! Investors have piled boat loads of cash into our cause the last few years for us to continue proliferating the 'Huntress Way' to wrecking hackers. \n-\t90 teammates (~ 1/3 of 1+ yr tenured workforce) have been promoted or earned another career growth opportunity as part of our 2x / yr compensation and promo review process.  Many more than this received merit-based pay adjustments. Every promotion has been shown and celebrated at Town Halls (aka- “Movers &amp; Shakers”) so all teammates know who they are.\n-\tAlso, every name &amp; face of our 150+ hires and the handful of leavers have also been shown, so all teammates can clearly track who’s coming and going. \n-\tWe recently won an Inc. best places to work award (granted exclusively on employee feedback from a survey they ran).  Our recent semi-annual anonymous (guaranteed by the vendor we utilize) survey showed a huge leap in employee net promotor score (58 - considered top tier in tech industry) \n-\tFollowing our anonymous in-house surveys, we ask people to post externally to Glassdoor (aka- “You’ve shared your voice with us in this survey; now we ask that you tell the world”).  We encourage people to post transparently and authentically how they are feeling- not directing what to say.  And of course there’s no way to incentivize posts with it all being anonymous.\n\nIn summary, every data point shared here is shared with all teammates monthly, as we embrace radical transparency.  In short, our BA hacker talent has driven extraordinary growth, enabling us to continually invest more into growing our teammates, and there’s no end in site.  Two things have remained true for nine years and will continue:\n*Hackers gonna hack.\n*Huntress gonna hunt.",

That goes for my direct teammates, manager, the c-suite and everyone in between. \n\nI recently had the pleasure of meeting all of these people in person at our summit. The energy, positivity and can-do attitude in those rooms was truly unique. I feel we as a collective are excited by our work protecting the 99% from cyber attacks. There is a deep sense of purpose there. \n\nFrom the get-go, I felt like Huntress invested in me. Which in turn made me motivated to invest my time, skills and growth right back. I’m given the tools, equipment and resources I need to do my job well. Feedback is encouraged and welcomed. Absolutely the best company culture, benefits and competitive pay. \n\nI feel lucky to be apart of this company.",

We have grown our headcount by 100% in the last year and revenue by the same in the previous few years.  And our growth trajectory continues.    \n\nPlease feel free to reach out to our People team if you wish to talk through your input further.  We wish you the best in your future career!",

If you thrive on always being on and available this is the place for you, literally you best be okay with putting in evening and weekend hours consistently because “that’s just how it is working at a startup.” weird exec comments on company all hands to justify the crazy work that makes it sound like they’re primarily looking out for themselves and their pocketbooks. Diversity is a thing in a select few teams but not so much for others. Also very much felt like old guard vs new guard while I was there and the “new” wasn’t as respected as those who had been there since the beginning and they got a pass for being rude and demeaning to teammates because it’s just who they are. Wouldn’t be surprised if this review is followed up with some internal stats to justify what they do. They’re still growing because they have a legit product and customers legit love them but the way you’re expected to sacrifice your personal life for them and the mind games are not worth it. There’s also a ton of senior leadership and not enough people doing the work.",

For my department there are almost as many managers as there are workers, with managers earning 2-4x as much as workers. Over half the open jobs right now are managerial. Because of the low pay, some departments are always understaffed, which also conveniently leaves you stuck in a low paying position because they can't afford to replace you hard work is not rewarded so many just do the bare minimum education assistance is refunded, so if you don't have a few grand laying around for education you're SOL. You know who needs education assistance the most? People in your low paying positions, people without the spare money to pay for education up front. some positions pay far under the current market rate. Their favorite trick is to write your job description for a high level position, but then give you a lower title so they can claim they are paying market rate based on the title.",

              "response": "Thank you for sharing your thoughts.  Open feedback and dialogue are essential here and we take it seriously.\nYou’ve raised a number of points, some of which we are actively working on, and most of which aren’t consistent with our values, facts, data, or broader feedback from your teammates.\n\nWe’re rapidly scaling and we acknowledge we are not perfect.  You reported being one of our few 3+ yr employees (most of our growth has occurred in the last 18 months), so you were here when we were in our early-stages of growth, and our very small team met regularly with the Founders who have come to know you personally.  In your tenure, you’ve seen our explosive growth to 250+ global teammates, and participated in 36+ Town Halls, our twice annual all-employee Summits, and a multitude of Slack collaboration.  We work really hard to personify our TRANSPARENCY value, regularly looking at ourselves in the mirror, and engaging in open dialogue about our gaps and how we can collectively address them.\n\nSo your comments are surprising and disappointing.  As we recently shared companywide, our global teammates rated our culture significantly above industry benchmark in almost every question, and reflected continual improvement in nearly every category. \n\nSince our founding, you’ve seen the only reason we’ve managed to continually grow 2x/year is through open dialogue.  So please reach out to any of your fellow teammates - Founders, Execs, People team, etc.. - to continue to share your experiences and collaborate on building the culture where “PPPs” (passionate, purpose-driven prodigies) thrive.",

All that's changed is there is a tiny bonus for everyone now, but since it's based on pay all that did was increase the wage gap.",

For my department there are almost as many managers as there are workers, with managers earning 2-4x as much as workers. Over half the open jobs right now are managerial. Because of the low pay, some departments are always understaffed, which also conveniently leaves you stuck in a low paying position because they can't afford to replace you hard work is not rewarded so many just do the bare minimum education assistance is refunded, so if you don't have a few grand laying around for education you're SOL. You know who needs education assistance the most? People in your low paying positions, people without the spare money to pay for education up front. some positions pay far under the current market rate.

        "cons": "I am loathe to have to write this, but I feel like I have to warn prospects and current leaders about the culture at the company (doubt they'll care). Huntress is succeeding despite it's best efforts to sabotage itself. And I want it to succeed.\n\nHuntress's culture has declined to the point that the direction of the company is in the balance. Employees no longer have any loyalty, because of a lack of a feeling of job security. Loyalty and pride used to be main drivers behind employee morale. The pride everyone used to have is waning, as they realize the company does not care about them at all. Employees are feeling like they're just a cog in the wheel.\n\nThe company cycles through leaders in all departments so quickly that there is no loyalty or feeling of job security. Every department's leadership has cycled numerous times in just a few years, except the one that needs a refresh. Once leaders leave, the current employees are no longer supported by the new crew, and many often are cycled out also.\n\nThe company is led by founders without business chops or background. If you don't play their bro game, you're out. They are executing a playbook to cycle out leaders every 12-18 months, a strategy that may have benefits in the short term, but destroys culture and morale. The founders have no clue how to lead or what is needed at each position, and it shows. No sophisticated leader would follow this juvenile strategy. \n\nWhile I do not think it's intentional, the leadership style by the founders is that of fear. Yes, it's their company (although now at Series D, they have board bosses that should step in). Look, the founders had a great idea, designed a sweet product, and built a good company. But, they have not evolved as leaders with the stage of the company. Instead of seeing that, the problem is always someone else. Nobody ever meets their standards, communication is ineffective or nonexistent, and role definitions change or are misunderstood. Instead of bringing people along and up, the founders lead by fear and cycle out bodies for the new shiny toy. Really great, super qualified employees are not up-leveled or refreshed to retain them-the company mindset is apparently we can just go get someone else. Everyone is afraid to disagree or to take initiative, as it's always \"wrong.\" Beloved leaders and employees are being purged for \"the next stage\" -- a next stage that nobody seems to understand. \n\nImportantly, no one feels like they'll be a part of the future they talk about. When founders talk about massive future growth, the eye rolls start as most do not think they'll be a part of it. If the company ever goes public, it will likely do so without anyone who was a part of its growth stages. That is jarring. Only the founders will ring that bell. Other leaders who have the background, chops, and institutional knowledge will have left a company they help grow gangbusters. It's bonkers.\n\nThe culture has suffered. Almost everyone is actively looking for positions elsewhere, and aren't even quiet about it--from those here 6 months to those with 4 years behind them. Largely because they just don't know when they'll get the boot, and the constant stress of long hours and unknown as to whether it's enough (it never is).\n\nIf they did an actual anonymous poll, instead of one where replies can be tracked back (data broken down so granular is not anonymous), they'd get more candid feedback.\n\nFinally, do not believe all of the glowing reviews--the company incentivized people to positively review. \n\nYes, outwardly the branding is cool and the products kick butt. But inwardly, culture is toxic and future perceptions are bleak.\n\nSmoke and mirrors.\n\nThe company needs a pause and reset.",

When your sole focus is numbers, people get left behind, forgotten, and abruptly let go. Everyone is terrified for lack of job security and most are trying to find roles elsewhere. In addition, promotions are scarce at best. The most deserving wait years to potentially get promoted, most are still stagnant in their roles while outside hires supersede them. The Huntress product development also was top notch. Recently, the company decided to focus only on sales and encouraged the sales teams to promote products that were not ready. Anyone that challenged this approach was quickly silenced. Care for your employees and product is crucial to success and without it, the company will never be a place I would recommend to anyone.",

      "# [Huntress Captures $150M Series D At $1.5B-Plus Valuation by Chris Metinko on 2024-06-18](https://news.crunchbase.com/cybersecurity/huntress-unicorn-wiz-startup-venture-funding/)\nMaryland-based Huntress became the newest cybersecurity unicorn after it raised a $150 million Series D at a $1.5 billion-plus valuation.\n\nThe new round was led by Kleiner Perkins, Meritech Capital and existing investor Sapphire Ventures.\n\nThe startup focuses on security services for small business to small enterprise customers — an often overlooked sector in cyber as many companies chase Fortune 500 companies.\n\n“Everyone deserves the ability to protect themselves and their employees’ livelihoods. This is the ‘why’ that supercharges my team to work around the clock and democratize access to the tools and talent typically built for the enterprise,” said co-founder and CEO Kyle Hanslovan in a release.\n\nHuntress currently is realizing more than 70% year-to-year revenue growth for the past two years as it continues to “approach $100 million in annual recurring revenue.”\n\nFounded in 2015, Huntress has raised nearly $310 million, per Crunchbase.\n\nCyber funding\n\nHuntress’ fresh round is just the latest big cybersecurity round in a Q2 where funding has taken off.\n\nWith a couple of weeks still remaining in the quarter, cyber startups have raised $4.1 billion in 141 deals, per Crunchbase data. That far outpaces Q1’s numbers, when such startups raised $2.7 billion in 140 deals and smashes last year’s Q2 totals of $1.8 billion in 192 deals.\n\nOf course, this year’s Q2 numbers are helped out immensely by cloud security startup Wiz’s big announcement in May that it had raised $1 billion at a $12 billion valuation.

      "# [Cracks in the Foundation: Intrusions of FOUNDATION Accounting Software](https://www.huntress.com/blog/cracks-in-the-foundation-intrusions-of-foundation-accounting-software)\nOn September 14, Huntress discovered an emerging threat involving FOUNDATION Accounting Software, which is commonly used by contractors in the construction industry. Attackers have been observed brute forcing the software at scale, and gaining access simply by using the productâs default credentials. We're seeing active intrusions among plumbing, HVAC, concrete, and similar sub-industries.\n\nâ\n\nHow It Works\n\nThe FOUNDATION software includes a Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) instance to handle its database operations. While it is common to keep a database server internal and behind a firewall or VPN, the FOUNDATION software features connectivity and access by a mobile app.\n\nFor that reason, the TCP port 4243 may be exposed publicly for use by the mobile app. This 4243 port offers direct access to MSSQL.Â\n\nMicrosoft SQL Server includes a default system administrator account named [.highlight]sa[.highlight], which has full administrative privileges over the entire server. Additionally, the FOUNDATION software looks to have created a [.highlight]dba[.highlight] account, which is not a built-in user, but Huntress has observed multiple instances where these high-privilege accounts are left with unchanged default credentials.\n\nBecause these accounts have such a high privilege, these administrator accounts can readily enable and leverage a feature known as [.highlight]xp_cmdshell[.highlight] within MSSQL. This is an extended stored procedure that allows the execution of OS commands directly from SQL, enabling users to run shell commands and scripts as if they had access right from the system command prompt.\n\n[.highlight]-- Enable advanced options[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]RECONFIGURE;[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]-- Enable xp_cmdshell[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]EXEC sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1;[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]RECONFIGURE;[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]-- Run a shell command as an example[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]EXEC xp_cmdshell 'ipconfig';[.highlight]\n\nâ\n\nHow To Stay Protected\n\nSince we're seeing attackers exploit publicly facing versions of the software using default credentials, we advise the following to mitigate this threat:\n\nRotate all credentials for accounts connected to FOUNDATION's database, including [.highlight]dba[.highlight] and [.highlight]sa[.highlight].\n\nThis can be done within MSSQL with a command:\n\n[.highlight]ALTER LOGIN sa WITH PASSWORD = 'NewStrongPassword';[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]ALTER LOGIN dba WITH PASSWORD = 'AnotherNewPassword';[.highlight]\n\nWhere possible, cease exposing the [.highlight]Foundation[.highlight] application to the public Internet.\n\nDisable [.highlight]xp_cmdshell[.highlight] where appropriate.\n\nâ\n\nHow We Discovered the Threat\n\nThe Huntress SOC initially saw activity begin on September 14 at 15:38:35 UTC. What tipped us off was host/domain enumeration commands spawning from a parent process of [.highlight]sqlservr.exe[.highlight].\n\nLooking at commonalities among the affected machines, it was apparent that the attack was scripted, as the same commands spread out across several unrelated companies within a span of a few minutes.\n\nâ\n\nFor your own investigative purposes, the FOUNDATION software is typically installed at:\n\n[.highlight]C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Foundation[.highlight]\n\nwith a subdirectory, [.highlight]ServerConsole3000[.highlight], that contains its server component.\n\nTo examine the SQL database access, we saw the brute force attempts in\n\n[.highlight]C:\\Program Files\\microsoft sql[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]server\\MSSQL12.FOUNDATION\\MSSQL\\Log\\ERRORLOG[.highlight]\n\nwhere the version MSSQL12 may vary between MSSQL11, MSSQL13, MSSQL15, etc.\n\nOn one host we observed ~35,000 brute force login attempts against the MSSQL server ending just an hour before a successful authentication and enabling [.highlight]xp_cmdshell[.highlight] to run commands. It is evident in the logs:\n\n2024-09-14 11:24:45.79 spid51Â Â Â Configuration option 'show advanced options' changed from 0 to 1. Run the RECONFIGURE statement to install.\n\n2024-09-14 11:24:45.81 spid51Â Â Â Configuration option 'xp_cmdshell' changed from 0 to 1. Run the RECONFIGURE statement to install.\n\nWhile the brute force attempts may be any scanner on the Internet, access to [.highlight]xp_cmdshell[.highlight] from just default credentials is a more severe issue.\n\nLooking across the 3M+ endpoints that Huntress protects, we discovered ~500 hosts running the FOUNDATION software. From that pool, we confirmed that a sample of 33 hosts were publicly exposed with unchanged default credentials.\n\nâ\n\nHow Huntress Has Responded\n\nAs we typically do, we immediately isolate any machines where we detect suspicious activity while we investigate. At that point, we set out to identify the underlying cause for the suspicious activities. We also took measures to identify any potential detection capabilities.\n\nIn addition to notifying those where we saw suspicious activity, we also sent out a precautionary advisory notification to any of our customers and partners who have the FOUNDATION software in their environment. While we did not see any suspicious activity in these accounts, we wanted to ensure they take the precautionary measures we suggested above to reduce the risk of them being compromised in the future.\n\nâ",
      "# [Huntress CEO On Raising $150M To ‘Democratize’ SIEM, Data Protection For SMBs by Kyle Alspach](https://www.crn.com/news/security/2024/huntress-ceo-on-raising-150m-to-democratize-siem-data-protection-for-smbs)\nKyle Hanslovan tells CRN that the funding round—which more than doubles Huntress’ valuation to surpass $1.5 billion—will boost the company’s R&D and M&A efforts with a focus on key segments for partners.\n\nHuntress announced Tuesday it has raised $150 million in funding to accelerate its expansion into new product segments, as part of a drive to spur growth for partners and better secure their SMB customers, Huntress Co-Founder and CEO Kyle Hanslovan told CRN.\n\nThe SMB-focused managed cybersecurity vendor is planning to move into SIEM (security information and event management) and is eyeing additional categories such as security posture management, as well as offerings that will “reinvent” data backup and recovery, Hanslovan said.\n\n[Related: The 20 Coolest Endpoint And Managed Security Companies Of 2024]\n\nThe expansion moves come as “the pace that the threat actors in cybercrime have pivoted towards SMBs [has] not slowed,” he said. “I've just had to stop and say, ‘I cannot just wait for where hackers are going to go next.’”\n\nThe new funding brings unicorn status to Huntress, more than doubling the company’s valuation to surpass $1.5 billion. The round is also a greater amount of funding than the previous total that’d been raised by the company since its launch in 2015, bringing Huntress to $268 million raised to date.\n\nThe Series D round was led by two new investors, Kleiner Perkins and Meritech Capital, as well as by existing backer Sapphire Ventures. Winning the backing of these Silicon Valley venture luminaries is a huge validation for Huntress’ approach of focusing on working with partners to meet the security needs of under-protected SMBs, Hanslovan told CRN.\n\nNow, “we’ve got three of the top five growth-stage VCs backing us,” he said. Additionally, “this is the last round that would likely happen” prior to an initial public offering for Huntress.\n\n“This is all preparing for the future IPO,” Hanslovan said.\n\nHalf of the funding or more will be targeted toward R&D and M&A, he noted. “The other half is going to be tons of education, awareness, go-to-market [investments].”\n\nHuntress reached $70 million in annual recurring revenue in 2023 and expects to cross $100 million in ARR later this year, Hanslovan said. In terms of headcount, the company currently employs 360 and will likely surpass 400 by the end of the year, he said.\n\nUltimately, “one of my biggest efforts with this new approach—both for SIEM as well as the security posture management and the backup-recovery—I'm trying to democratize [security capabilities],” Hanslovan said. “So when somebody gets our implementation, it can be rolled out to every customer. The biggest thing that I'm doing [is] democratizing.”\n\nWhat follows is an edited and condensed portion of CRN’s interview with Hanslovan.\n\nWhat prompted you to raise more funding now and what are the major goals for it?\n\nI've been just really stressing about the pace that the threat actors in cybercrime have pivoted towards SMBs — it's not slowed. And the amount of attack service they're now starting to go after [has grown].\n\nWe have 14,000 healthcare companies [as customers] — the vast majority of them on that United / Change Healthcare network that were being impacted by not being able to either submit claims or get reimbursed. So I have first-hand, direct experience of where people are getting wrecked. And I've just had to stop and say, “I cannot just wait for where hackers are going to go next.”\n\nOf course I love the detection and response lane. I now have ITDR — identity threat detection and response. That's the [Microsoft] 365, G Suite, SaaS-based detection and response. That's great. And during our Series C, I said we were going to go from a one-product company to a many-product company.\n\nEmployees are obviously another thing threat actors [are targeting]. So I’ve got now my foothold in [that] market through awareness training, phishing simulation.\n\nI am about to rip the market open on security posture management. I'm just hearing it all over. I'm ripping into that whole security posture lane of products.\n\nAre you interested in looking at more acquisitions?\n\nI might be doing some M&A on [categories like] security posture management on SaaS apps, security posture management of the cloud. There's a huge opportunity over there. But I'm looking at these backup products and I don't think I'm going to do M&A over there. I've looked at a couple companies. [But] none of my clients come and say, “I need a technology that I can run a backup and manually store.” The things that I'm hearing are, “If you know where my files are ransomed, why aren’t you automatically restoring my files with no interaction? Why isn't that being done autonomously?” And when [an attacker] slipped by, now let me automate the recovery on this. We're really going to try to reinvent backup. We're going to try to really blow this up and build a data recovery solution and a continuity solution — [where] I might have to use the old school words of backup and recovery — but they're just fundamentally not going to look like what [today’s backup products] are doing.\n\nCould you say a bit more on where else your R&D efforts will be focused?\n\nPartners want to own a lot of the security process. For a very long time our partner base was saying, “You elevate to me what the problem is, but I want to own taking the response. I want to own that relationship.” A lot of our partners are starting to see what we've been warning of — if you don't give up a little bit more autonomy to your SOC that's taking care of this for you, we can't make you look like the rock star. So one of the biggest things I'm looking at doing is, I'm trying to completely push the boundaries on not only what should an outside team be able to do on your behalf — but how do they escalate? We're trying to make our products [become] much more fully automated on their behalf.\n\nI finally now have the platform infrastructure I built [after the last funding round]. And you're going to see a lot more research and development and new stuff for our partners that's going to make their whole stack automatically collaborate with each other. Where we want to push the bounds with our research is, imagine if you see credentials stolen off an endpoint — why can't I automatically lock down the SaaS identities that are there? Or vice versa — somebody falls for a phishing email, why can't I automatically cue up the education and training to help prevent that from happening in the future? This is how a real platform is supposed to interoperate. I'm continuing to bring that enterprise-quality tech but really pairing it with enterprise-quality humans.\n\nAnd that's actually solving the biggest hurdles. Our partners continue to tell me, “I have more attack surface than I can handle. I cannot staff these more senior IT and security people. And I want you to make my most junior IT people into the rock stars.”\n\nAre there other product segments you’re interested in?\n\nSIEM has been a solution that most people only roll out to part of their base. When I go talk to my partners, one story sounds like this: 30 percent of my base gets it, but I only give it to the customers that are willing to pay [for] the premium platform. It's never the doctor’s and dentist’s office that actually need it. It's never the community waterworks or rural electricity company, that actually is a small business itself. Those are never the people with the budget. So one of my biggest efforts with this new approach — both for SIEM as well as the security posture management and the backup-recovery — I'm trying to democratize [security capabilities]. So when somebody gets our implementation, it can be rolled out to every customer. The biggest thing that I'm doing [is] democratizing.\n\nOur [customers] need something that can outrun hackers. But they don't have the budget and the team to maintain a Formula One car. So what Huntress is building is a high-end sports car. We're effectively building a Lamborghini. I'm just in the business of high-end sports cars but I also know what I'm not.\n\nPart of building this for the SMB is being laser-focused on, what do they truly need? Let's build the high-end sports cars for the small business to the small enterprise, and leave the Formula One cars to the Fortune 5000.\n\nAny other ways this funding might help to drive growth for partners?\n\nI'm just starting to realize how much of the market my channel partners don't already have. I am doubling down on a ton of demand gen to bring more of this SMB into my partners. We still haven't changed. We're still channel-first. So even when we do direct marketing, we always give that customer [to the partner]. The question we ask is, “Who would you like to fulfill through.” So we're trying to continue building more and more and bringing that demand into our partners.",

      "# [Huntress warns of attacks on Foundation Software accounts by Arielle Waldman, Alex Scroxton, Ben Lutkevich, Ed Moyle on 2024-09-18](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/366611274/Huntress-warns-of-attacks-on-Foundation-Software-accounts)\nHuntress warned that attackers are targeting the construction industry with brute force attacks against accounting software accounts with default credentials.\n\nIn a blog post published Tuesday, the cybersecurity vendor detailed an emerging brute force attack campaign it first observed Sept. 14. The campaign is targeting customers of Foundation Software, which is commonly used in the construction industry for financial reporting and billing forms.\n\nMax Rogers, senior director of Huntress' threat operations center, flagged suspicious activity Sept. 14 in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Rogers said Huntress was seeing \"wide-spread attacks against Construction companies.\"\n\nAfter detecting suspicious activity, Huntress said it isolated affected machines and initiated an investigation. Additionally, the company notified any affected individuals and sent a \"precautionary advisory\" to any Huntress customer who uses Foundation in their environment.\n\nThe attack scope may be limited for now. Huntress said it discovered around 500 hosts running the Foundation software and that 33 of them were publicly exposed with unchanged default credentials. John Hammond, principal security researcher at Huntress, told TechTarget Editorial that although the numbers may appear small, there are third-party risks to consider as affected customers may internal connections to other organizations.\n\nThose concerns particularly apply to the 33 hosts with unchanged default passwords. Hammond said the security shortcoming provides attackers with \"immediate and open-door access.\" The blog post expanded on the scope and affected industries.\n\n\"Attackers have been observed brute forcing the software at scale, and gaining access simply by using the product's default credentials. We're seeing active intrusions among plumbing, HVAC, concrete, and similar sub-industries,\" Huntress wrote in the blog post.\n\nHuntress stated the attack takes advantage of publicly facing Foundation instances. Foundation uses the Microsoft SQL Server, which Huntress said is a database that includes a default system administrator account. If attackers compromise the account, dubbed \"sa,\" they can gain full administrative privileges over the entire server.\n\nHuntress observed that many high-privilege sa accounts still use default credentials, which unknown threat actors compromised through brute force attacks. Once threat actors access the accounts, they can use a feature called \"xp_cmdshell\" within SQL Server, which enables users to run operating system commands and scripts.\n\n\"On one host we observed ~35,000 brute force login attempts against the MSSQL server ending just an hour before a successful authentication and enabling xp_cmdshell to run commands,\" the blog post said.\n\nHuntress recommended that users rotate credentials for accounts connected to the Foundation database, disable xp_cmdshell if possible, and remove the application from the public internet wherever possible.\n\nTracie Kuczkowski, vice president of marketing at Foundation, sent the following statement to TechTarget Editorial:\n\n\"The event potentially impacted a small subset of on-premise FOUNDATION users. It did not at all impact the bulk of our accounting users, which are under our secure, cloud-based SaaS offering. It also did not impact our internal systems or any of our other product offerings through our subsidiary companies. As a result of not following recommendations and security best practices that were provided (one example being not resetting the default credentials), this small subset of on-premise users might face possible vulnerabilities.

      "# [Huntress raises $150M at $1.5B+ valuation for its managed cybersecurity platform by MARIA DEUTSCHER, CHERYL KNIGHT, JAMES FARRELL, MIKE WHEATLEY, DUNCAN RILEY on 2024-06-18](https://siliconangle.com/2024/06/18/huntress-raises-150m-1-5b-valuation-managed-cybersecurity-platform/)\nHuntress Labs Inc., a fast-growing managed cybersecurity provider, today disclosed that it has raised $150 million at a valuation exceeding $1.5 billion.\n\nKleiner Perkins, Meritech Capital and Sapphire Ventures led the round. CRN reported that the raise, a Series D investment, is likely the last for Huntress before going public. The company is reportedly on track to end the year with more than $100 million in annual recurring revenue.\n\nFounded in 2015, Huntress provides a managed cybersecurity platform for small and medium-sized businesses. The platform can spot vulnerabilities in a company’s technology environment, as well as attempts by hackers to exploit those vulnerabilities. When a cyberattack is detected, Huntress’ cybersecurity professionals investigate the incident and remediate it on behalf of the affected company.\n\n“Everyone deserves the ability to protect themselves and their employees’ livelihoods,” said Huntress Chief Executive Officer Kyle Hanslovan (pictured, center, with co-founders Chris Bisnett and John Ferrell). “This is the ‘why’ that supercharges my team to work around the clock and democratize access to the tools and talent typically built for the enterprise.”\n\nOne of the tasks that Huntress’ platform promises to ease is mitigating ransomware attacks. It deploys small files, or canaries, throughout a company’s network that function as ransomware sensors. If hackers attempt to encrypt one of the files, the platform notifies Huntress’ cybersecurity professionals.\n\nSome cyberattacks are carried out using not malware but rather the existing, legitimate applications used by a company’s employees. Huntress says that its platform can detect such breach attempts. It also spots vulnerabilities that might lead to cyberattacks in the future, such as open network ports that allow traffic from external websites to reach a company’s internal infrastructure.\n\nHuntress provides its core threat detection and remediation features alongside a cybersecurity training tool. According to the company, the tool allows organizations to send simulated phishing emails to their employees. If a worker clicks on a link in one of the messages, Huntress’ platform displays educational content on how to spot phishing campaigns.\n\nThe company says that its revenue has grown by over 70% in each of the past two years thanks to strong demand. According to Huntress, customers are now using its software to protect nearly 3.5 million systems and user accounts.\n\nTo maintain its sales momentum, the company will spend a portion of its newly raised capital on expanding its go-to-market team. In parallel, Huntress plans to enhance its feature set and explore acquisition opportunities. It intends to buy companies with technology that eases cybersecurity tasks such as detecting infrastructure vulnerabilities.\n\nPhoto: Huntress",
