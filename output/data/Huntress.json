      "# [Triangulation](https://www.huntress.com/blog/triangulation)\nOnce upon a time, I had my butt handed to me in a post-incident response debrief.\n\nI thought it was a good report. It was actually one of my first, many years ago.Â\n\nHowever, one or two executives in that debrief session began to question the credibility of the report. âWhy wasnât it one hundred pages?â, and âhow could you say for sure something happened during a window of time?â, and even âhow can we be sure youâve given this your full attention?âÂ\n\nSmelling blood in the water, one dissenting voice turned into a frenzy of sharks all trying to take a chunk of my derriere. The rest of that session was not spent explaining the nuance of their intrusion, but instead re-gaining the trust, credibility and confidence that my report had failed to instill in the client after their incident.Â\n\nAn unlucky constellation of factors meant one of my first IR reports was not well-received. Some of it was my inexperience and very apparent youth. A major failing was that I had not used the report to its full potential; I had failed to use the report to establish the impression of credibility in my reader.\n\nTriangulating for Credibility\n\nWe are intertwined in our incident reports, our summary of new zero-days, our Twitter threads.Â A bit of ego and vanity goes into technical writing, and any doubt about the efficacy of what we are writing is, by extension, a doubt of our credibility.\n\nI donât want you to flail at the first hit of criticism. Instead, I want you to protect your vanity and reputation by leaving your reader with zero doubt that you are an expert who makes well-founded, evidence-driven conclusions. With and through evidence, youâll be speaking with impeccable authority.\n\nTriangulation is an investigative concept from the social sciences we can kindly borrow and transpose. Here, the investigator enriches the validity and reliability of their claims by leveraging multiple methods and layering evidence from multiple sources of data that all speak to the same phenomenon.Â\n\nPut more specifically for infosec folk, triangulating involves using multiple sources of telemetry on a machine to hone in one theory at a time to disprove or prove it.Â\n\nAfter that terrible debrief session, I changed the way I wrote. Triangulation was one of many techniques I deployed to ensure a reader received (implicitly or explicitly) the impression that this report was as close to fact as possible, and I was an investigator of good repute and attentiveness.Â\n\nNow, you and I know that I am a clown (if not the whole circus) for most things, even if your only exposure to me has been through my blogs. But not when it comes to reportsâI mean business when I write reports. And I would like you to also mean business when you write your reports.Â\n\nI would like you to write technical reports that contain zero assumptions or assertions and instead act as your own first-layer peer-reviewer. You can triangulate your findings to corroborate your hypotheses, theories and ideas, and produce reports that convey unshakable confidence in your reader as well as contain technical excellence.Â\n\nTriangulation IRL\n\nWhen have I ever given you the recipe without bringing something fresh out the kitchen too? Weâll use a real case as an example of how triangulation can be used in real investigations.Â\n\nJust the other day, my colleague Cat Contillo and I found some spare time to do some honest security work. We had an alert come through that was a bit too vague for our liking, so we decided to flesh it out and make a report for the partner that had a good context with even better actionable findings.Â\n\nWeâre rarely so fortunate to have good security-enabled Windows Event logs on any given machine. On this occasion, Cat and I didnât find much from the logs, but we did leverage some digital forensic artefacts to mount our investigation from.Â\n\nThe alert we received was about potential lateral movement that ended up being PsExec. We could have just sent a generic report that did the bare minimum of communicating a threatâ¦.but thatâs not our style. Instead, we leveraged a number of data sources in order to tell a far more detailed, convincing story that offered the partner confidence in our report and our recommendations.\n\nTo triangulate PsExec, Iâll recreate our investigation and show you a couple of cool artefacts we can collect, contrast and compare:\n\nThe Windows registry data related to PsExec\n\nThe record from Background Activity Moderator (BAM)\n\nThe frequency of execution from PrefetchÂ\n\nA Moment on PsExec\n\nOur enquiry should lead with a good foundation of the phenomenon we want to study. So letâs dwell on PsExec for a moment.Â\n\nPsExec is a legitimate system administration tool as much as it is a tool for adversaries to laterally move in a domain. In our example for this article, when we launch PsExec from our host machine (Thornfield), weâre creating a remote session in the target machine (MoorHouse), and gain an interactive session with our âJEyreâ user.Â\n\nSimplified explanation. For greater detail, please read ExtraHops' blog post.\n\nAn unappreciated part of PsExec is the reciprocating agent that ephemerally appears on the target machine.\n\nMonitoring for PsExeSVC.exe to pop up somewhere in your environment is a great opportunity for detection. A PsExec connection will instigate an EventID 7045 (Service) on the target machineâs System.evtx for PsExeSVC. It will offer the connection time for us to focus on, as well as confirm the user account via SID (which Iâll show you how to convert in a minute).\n\nBut note, adversaries can control the service name by using the `-r` flag on PsExec, and is therefore not a foolproof method of detection.Â\n\nNow we have spent some time on PsExec and gathered ourselves a few basic facts about investigating, let's take it up a notch and see what artefacts we can triangulate to tell a fuller story.\n\nEULA Accepted in the Registry\n\nAttackers can try to change the name of the PsExec executable itself to evade detection, but something theyâre less likely to evade will be the impact on the Windows registry.Â\n\nWe can take a look in our registry for the EulaAccepted, which will appear with the value ofÂ â1â if PsExec has been dropped on this machine and the EULA pop-up has been accepted.\n\nWe can look across the registry from HKEY_USERS to identify which user accounts (via their SIDs) have leveraged PsExec.\n\nHKEY_USERS\\S-*\\Software\\Sysinternals\\PsExecÂ Â\n\nHowever, notice we donât get a corresponding username gifted to us. Instead, we get the long SID string. To convert that to a username, try this:\n\nâ\n\nOr over-engineer a solution!\n\nAn issue with wrapping up our investigation here and now is that we have no clue when the registry was changed / when and if PsExec was actually executed.\n\nIf a user account previously and legitimately used PsExec, that now brings into doubt the validity of assumption that THIS particular PsExec activity was the threat actor and was malicious.Â All we can conclude from the registry data is that PsExec has been on disk and associated with the JEyre account.Â\n\nBackground Activity Moderator (BAM)\n\nBackground Activity Moderator is an interesting source of telemetry, seemingly available from Windows 10 onwards.Â\n\nIâve heard claims BAM can ONLY be found on Win10 machines, but this is definitely not trueâthe data below has all been pulled from a Windows Server (Server 2022, Version 2009 Build 20348). However, I cannot claim to have any semblance of knowledge on exactly which OS, builds and versions BAM is and is not present for. ð¤·\n\nBAM is useful for illuminating the full path of an executed program, the time it was executed and the SID / user account associated with this execution. This offers us a layer of evidence different from that of the EULA Accept, which could tell us PsExec once existed under JEyre but couldnât offer a time.\n\nTo query BAM, youâve got two options:Â\n\nThe first is to simply manually look at the registry data. This can be messy and does not convert SIDs for you, but boy ainât it nice to get your hands dirty sometimes?\n\nThe second is to leverage Matthew Greenâs Get-BAMParser.ps1 PowerShell script, which includes a nicer format and converts SIDs to user accounts. I made a change request on this script so it would work with Server 2022.Â\n\nIf manual: you donât need a fancy script! Just good eyes. What we lose here, however, are timestamps.Â\n\nAnd if you use the script, be ready to ZOOM in. We get timestamps via the PowerShell script, which is a huge and necessary layer of evidence.\n\nAnalyzing BAMâs data on PsExec gives us the user account JEyre with the full path of execution. This is useful, as it corroborates what the EULA registry data stated about JEyre, and now we have specific directories that we can go and investigate to see if the threat actor dropped any other tools. Moreover, BAM offers a wider context of some activities that occurred, and we can start to contextualise what the threat actor did while they were in our environment.Â\n\nA limitation of BAM is that it trusts the executable name. If we rename it NotPsExec.exe that is how BAM will record it and report it back to us after parsing. Unlike checking the EULA registry data, which confirms PsExec was run and accepted, BAM goes off the sincerity of the executable name. Moreover, BAM offers little clarification on the frequency of execution. Is this the first time, or last time, or any time that the threat actor used JEyreâs account to PsExec?\n\nWe have a much clearer picture than when we started. But now we need to start gathering actionable information for our reader.\n\nPrefetch\n\nIâve spoken about prefetch before. It is automatically disabled on Windows Servers, but can be enabled with ease. If youâre unable to leverage prefetch to triangulate, might I suggest Amcache and Shimcache instead.Â\n\nYou can gain some early insight by looking in the prefetch directory on the host. Things executed will have a .PF file, but just looking at this directory alone is useful.\n\nÂ\n\nYou can pick up a .PF file and parse it using Eric Zimmermanâs PECmd tool:\n\nBy leveraging prefetch, we gain something quite interesting that we did not have before: precise frequency of execution. We are told that an executable called PsExec.exe ran six times, and the run times are put precisely. Moreover, from prefetch, we do not get a user account confirmed, but we do get insight on the directories referenced when PsExec was evoked.\n\nI say an executable called PsExec.exe, because prefetch is not able to qualify the executable name. Like BAM, it trusts the executable name and bases the recording of data from that name. So if this was renamed NotPsExec.exe, that is what we would see.Â\n\nHowever, name manipulation does not make prefetch data useless. We can continue to triangulate our findings by pivoting over to the target machine. In the targetâs prefetch directory, we can find record of PsExeSVC.exe: the reciprocating agent to PsExec.Â\n\nBy parsing PsExeSVCâs prefetch file, we get a more certain timestamp. This assumes the threat actor did not change the service name (as we have noted), but we can see a far much specific time that grounds our above six PsExec times from prefetch.\n\nAnd going full circle in our triangulation, we actually already saw this timestamp when we looked at EventID 7045âs in the System log of the target machine. Thus, we have near factual conclusions about the time of activity.Â\n\nA limitation of prefetch is that it first has to be present on the host, and second that it lacks the ability to attribute user accounts and is too trusting of the sincerity of executable names. But these flaws are addressed by the information in other telemetry we have leveraged, and moreover, we now have a better window of time that we can offer our reader for malicious activity.\n\nLayers of Evidence\n\nLike layers of Swiss cheese, the different sources of telemetry individually have gapsâbut combined, they make a more cohesive block; a more definitive, credible story is told once we amass and triangulate our data.Â\n\nOur report about the lateral movement has been nuanced by our triangulation. We were able to confirm the lateral movement was indeed Psexec via the 7045s in the System log, the data in the EULA and in BAM in the registry, as well as prefetch that added greater nuance about frequency and path location.Â Â\n\nBy triangulating these different sources of telemetry, and using each of their strengths to compensate their weaknesses, we gathered incredibly specific data that our readers can take action on. We corroborated the user account associated with PsExec (JEyre), we established the directories involved (C:\\Users\\JEyre\\Downloads\\PsTools), and established a window of time with (April 2022 April 4th 02:32 - 03:17 UTC).\n\nI hope Iâve successfully conveyed that triangulation is a worthy concept to stay conscious of during an investigation. Chances are youâre doing it already, and now you know a fancy word for it.Â\n\nThe point of triangulation isnât to prove the same things ten times over. The point of triangulation is to know the limitations of an individual digital forensic component, and to assemble a number of these artefacts to compensate and bring with them unique findings that add nuance to the phenomena we are investigating.Â\n\nWrapping Up\n\nWe all know that the executive summary on page one will be where most readers begin and end. We might want people to read our reports in their entirety. But we also want our readers to trust usâto trust our recommendations and findings from page one onwards.\n\nThrough triangulation, we can offer reports that are laden with actionable information for a reader to run withâand the confidence that we, the investigators, have reported as close to fact as possible.\n\nWe donât have to write verbosely to communicate our findings; itâs about specific language and certain phrases that demonstrate you are an investigator speaking with evidence-ordained authority on this matter. Maybe at some point, Iâll write about some of the particular vernacular I adopt when Iâm writing up reports (stay tuned). At any rate, I hope you enjoyed reading about triangulation, and I hope it saves your behind when you next have to report to a technical senior or executive.Â\n\nA major limitation of triangulation is that it requires the investigator to know and have access to multiple data sources that can all speak to a phenomenon they are studying. I donât have a good answer for this one I am afraidâyouâll just have to check out some of the material in the DFIR community and start leveling yourself! Or you can just keep following my articles on our Huntress blog. ð Why not both!?",

      "# [Huntress](https://www.huntress.com/platform/siem)\nSIEM, or security information and event management, was initially designed as a means to collect multiple disparate log sources and store the data under one centralized platform. Correlation rules took this one step further by adding a means to create alerts on the log data retrieved. Historically the use case for SIEM is built around: the collection/storage of logs, compliance, and threat visibility. The common problems with SIEM based on the âconsume all data'' approach are cost, training/skill to deploy and manage, and lastly, defining useful data from the noise.\n\nHuntress Managed SIEM was built from the ground up to solve the problem of data overload, unfiltered sources, and alert fatigue. Our Managed SIEM redefines the industry standard by applying Smart Filtering capabilities at the log source to only capture threat-specific logs. This simplifies the workload toward threat discovery and data retention. Managed SIEM is also built to collect Windows-based events and syslog using the same proprietary agent youâre familiar with. Supported by our AWS backend, your data is stored, safely and reliably.\n\nTraditional firewalls and antivirus is simply not enough. The time to discover incidents is about six months. Finding and targeting attackers quickly is only possible with a full picture of log data as a whole. SIEM creates a bird's eye view of log data to quickly identify an attacker's tracks using correlation analysis and Smart Filtering.\n\nThe Huntress team designed and built Smart Filtering from the ground up. While most vendors depend on the source (firewall, endpoint, router) to apply its own filters, we directly filter the log data using our proprietary filtering engine, acting as a sieve to collect only critical information from log sources.\n\nManaged SIEM can quickly integrate with existing infrastructure using the current Huntress EDR agent. Log data is captured using either the Huntress agent or Syslog collection and is forwarded to S3 in AWS for data storage. Searchable or âhot storageâ data is then relayed into Clickhouse for rapid visibility within the Huntress UI.\n\nWhile the Huntress EDR agent is designed for rapid response-based actions at the endpoint, our SIEM offering relays host Windows event and syslog data to our backend for further analysis and log storage. SIEM data is stored and hosted by the Huntress team for storage for up to a year by default.",

To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we collect or process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

      "# Post ID 1bez11c: Huntress opening up direct sales? with +60 score by [(ExR90, Reddit, 2024-03-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1bez11c/huntress_opening_up_direct_sales/)\nAnyone else notice that Huntress website has changed, and now they are opening up direct sales? The website has a new entry marketing to Businesses and IT teams. This is new within the past couple months, confirmed I wasn't mistaken via waybackmachine.\n\nI asked my rep and they confirmed they are no longer channel only and are doing direct now. They pinky promise they won't market to our clients, and/or will send to us if they get a call from them. A bit mixed signals since despite us configuring our branding/logo etc, the client facing stuff in EDR/MDR/SAT has Huntress branding, Huntress domain, and even their email/phone numbers on them instructing them to contact Huntress for support, and I was told this can't be changed.\n\nThe concern is not so much I think Huntress is out to move my cheese here, it's just the weird mixed messaging and other headaches that have come from this kind of change to direct in the past with other vendors.\n\nI want to believe they will do right, but then again sales folks will do sales things after all, look at how Dell respects their channel...\n\n## Comment ID kuwz8il with +83 score by [(andrew-huntress, Reddit, 2024-03-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1bez11c/huntress_opening_up_direct_sales/kuwz8il/) (in reply to ID 1bez11c):\nHey! It’s not too common that I get to speak about things here that I actually control at Huntress. For those of you who have seen me around /r/msp over the years but don’t know me, [I run Sales at Huntress](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankaiser/). Based on our industry’s track record with this stuff **I think you have good reason to be suspicious.**\n\nWe are indeed channel first, not channel only. This has always been our stance, but we have started marketing more on the “business and IT teams” recently. The good news is I’m responsible for what our process is, how we draw the lines, and what our rules of engagement are. I’ve been in this part of the channel for 15 years and (I was /u/andrew-opendns before Huntress) my job is to protect us from ourselves here. **Many vendors get this wrong because the people making those decisions don’t understand how MSPs work.** I like to think I’m pretty alright at that. \n\nI’m happy to answer questions about how we approach this, but at a high level we go out of our way during the qualification part of our process to figure out if an end-user has a relationship with a partner and we’ll do everything we can to run the deal through that partner. \n\nI fully understand the consequences of getting this wrong and promise that we analyze this stuff to ensure we don’t run the risk of pulling a sonicwall (oops should I not say that?).\n\nEdit: Signing off for a bit but I'll pop back in here over the weekend to answer more questions. I'm also happy to talk live if anyone has feedback and/or questions related to this or anything!\n\n### Comment ID kuzsh08 with +11 score by [(karlpalachuk, Reddit, 2024-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1bez11c/huntress_opening_up_direct_sales/kuzsh08/) (in reply to ID kuwz8il):\nAndrew - It's great to have the official inside response on this. Folks also need to remember that a lot of large opportunities are not inside our channel. If you could sell Huntress into a Fortune 500 company, you would. And no MSP would be losing a sale. :-)\n\nBut the OP is correct: Dell has forever set the standard of how NOT to set up a partner program. Sales people will do what they're paid to do.\n\n### Comment ID kv12u9k with +7 score by [(jeremy-blumira, Reddit, 2024-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1bez11c/huntress_opening_up_direct_sales/kv12u9k/) (in reply to ID kuwz8il):\nI can confirm that Huntress has always been this way (I was employee #19 hired by Andrew/Kyle) and that u/andrew-huntress is an amazing leader who won't allow the team or company to do anything that would jeopardize their commitment or relationship with the MSP community. \n\n  \nDespite many, many examples of companies making bad choices when it comes to channel engagement, it is possible to be multi-channel without conflict. When the compensation plans and rules of engagement are clear and 'doing the right thing' matters more than a 'just book it' mentality, as I know it does with Andrew and the Huntress founders, businesses can flourish in a multi-channel ecosystem.\n\nHonestly, you should want them too. More successful channels at Huntress that don't conflict with each other increases their ability to remain independent and service their top channel (MSPs) in the best possible ways for years to come.\n\n#### Comment ID kv27xds with +2 score by [(andrew-huntress, Reddit, 2024-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1bez11c/huntress_opening_up_direct_sales/kv27xds/) (in reply to ID kv12u9k):\n<3\n\n### Comment ID kux02mh with +8 score by [(matt0_0, Reddit, 2024-03-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1bez11c/huntress_opening_up_direct_sales/kux02mh/) (in reply to ID kuwz8il):\nJust a quick clarification from a big fan!  But when you say 'channel first, channel only' do you mean that as present tense or past tense?  Or soon to be past tense?\n\n#### Comment ID kux0cxi with +7 score by [(andrew-huntress, Reddit, 2024-03-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1bez11c/huntress_opening_up_direct_sales/kux0cxi/) (in reply to ID kux02mh):\nBy “channel first, not channel only” what I mean is that we want to take as many deals as possible through our partners.

Our client is on a fully managed MSA. His first port of call was to start requesting the login details for all this software he was seeing on his computer, including huntress, which he keeps dismissing as not good security because he’s never heard of it before. He’s been booking meetings with Carbon Black, SentinelOne, etc who he had heard of in his last role. \n\nSo if huntress wants to start marketing directly, as long as they are feeding through deals where relevant, this is only a 100% good thing that’s going to make our lives easier on the sell. We have a great relationship with our Veeam rep who is constantly feeding is new opportunities that fit our client base in our market and it works amazing, we often convert these leads into full MSA clients within a few months with upsell/cross sell. \n\nPS: SOC/SIEM when Andrew?

S1 only deals with large companies direct, everything else goes to Channel as an example. That is pretty \"clean edged\" and simple.\n\nThe branding issues were not really addressed though. Kinda weird for your brand and contact info to be going in client facing stuff. You do have our company name, logo, domain and via SAT/MDR even access to send emails in our domain, and via PSA integration can drop whatever text needed in there. Don't understand why the content isn't OUR branding and contact information instead of yours since you have all the needed info already. That would make this feel more complete and less weird/conflicting messaging.\n\n#### Comment ID kux2nlh with +20 score by [(andrew-huntress, Reddit, 2024-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1bez11c/huntress_opening_up_direct_sales/kux2nlh/) (in reply to ID kux1aj4):\nRight now the smallest license we'll sell to an end-user is 50 endpoints for $4,200.\n\nValid feedback on the branding, I don't think we've touched that in a while but we're getting ready to roll out a new partner portal (next few months I think but I'll double check timing) that will redo how all of the branding stuff works with a lot more options.

Your direct pricing is much higher then what I buy it for. Perhaps, when you have leads below a specific size, the customer should be directed to a local partner to purchase? give the prospect a list of 3 in their area?

The two play notably differently.\n\nSniper is probably slightly more straightforward as its about basically blasting enemies down while they stay clear of you.\n\nWarden is much more about leveraging visibility through grass and using seeds/consumables.\n\nSniper is easier to figure out how to do— but warden is stronger.

      "# Post ID yx6n40: why I think the Huntress is the weakest class. with +7 score by [(adeptdwight, Reddit, 2022-11-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelDungeon/comments/yx6n40/why_i_think_the_huntress_is_the_weakest_class/)\nIt is me or Huntress feels like the weakest class, allows me to explain\n\nStarting areas\nCompared to other classes her melee weapon feels weak, the warrior's shortsword simply does more damage, the rogue has on-demand surprise attacks, and the wizard's staff feels stronger along with his stronger ranged attacks. It's cool to attack twice, but it sucks if it doesn't do a lot or hit a lot. The Huntress' bow is cool, but enemies quickly close in the gap making it useless, especially crabs.\n\nMid game\nDuring this point her bow still can't do enough damage from around 5-6 spaces away to kill anything in the prison or caves. What makes it worse here is that now she has to deal with prison guards which can just drag her and force a melee fight. In the caves gnoll shamans outclass the huntress in a ranged fight.  \n\nLate game\nNow from dwarven kingdom to demon halls everyone can counter the huntress. Most enemies have ranged attacks, or mobility, such as dwarf warlocks, literally all of the elementals, golems can teleport you to them, and monks can parry her arrows Succubi teleports to you, ripper demons jump to you, demon eyes fire their lasers, and scorpio sting you and run.\n\n## Comment ID iwn4tf0 with +27 score by [(BairnONessie, Reddit, 2022-11-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelDungeon/comments/yx6n40/why_i_think_the_huntress_is_the_weakest_class/iwn4tf0/) (in reply to ID yx6n40):\nShe's got an auto-upgrading weapon that can be enchanted and doesn't use an item slot, allow her to use another weapon which can also be enchanted. As well as that, not needing any SoU for her bow frees them up for use elsewhere. She also has, imo, the strongest synergy with a ring in the game, that being sharpshooting and the crossbow. \n\nWarrior has no ranged attacks apart from throwing items which can be used by anyone and break. Rogue is the same, mage has a limited ranged attack. Huntress'ranged attack is unlimited. Rogue is the only character that can somewhat reliably one shot early enemies and that's by using his limited charge item\n\nCrabs are a challenge for all classes, that's their purpose, to try and get you to spend upgrades in armour. Huntress has a clear advantage over all other classes when it comes to ranged enemies, in that she can see through long grass and doesn't trample it when she walks through it, in fact she makes more grow, blocking enemies' LOS, while maintaining her own. No other class can do this.\n\nHuntress requires a different tactic. Just like rogue requires different tactics, just like mage... They all have their advantages and disadvantages.\n\n### Comment ID iwo2xcs with +9 score by [(RheoKalyke, Reddit, 2022-11-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelDungeon/comments/yx6n40/why_i_think_the_huntress_is_the_weakest_class/iwo2xcs/) (in reply to ID iwn4tf0):\nDon't forget also:\n\n-Huntress + Boots of nature = GG\n\n-Huntress + Sharpshooting ring = GG\n\n-Huntress + Wand of Regrowth = GG\n\n-Huntress + Rotberry seed = Mini GG\n\n-Huntress manages to get Blazing enchant on bow?

Enchant it at the alchemy pot with an enchant scroll and enjoy unlimited ranged application of whatever enchant you pick. It self upgrades so it stays relevant all game.\n\nUsing huntress properly does require more skill than the other classes because you need to understand vision and how to evade enemies to get the most out of the bow. \n\nIf you're struggling to get value out of the bow just go warden, rush the armor talent, and play like you're a warrior.\n\n### Comment ID iwn8fxm with +2 score by [(adeptdwight, Reddit, 2022-11-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelDungeon/comments/yx6n40/why_i_think_the_huntress_is_the_weakest_class/iwn8fxm/) (in reply to ID iwn6cc4):\nEh It feels like the bow upgrades too slowly, by the time you get to caves its only around +3 or +4.

Starting off with, you are correct, her gloves are weak and the warrior's sword is stronger. The rogue only has a couple of \"on demand surprise attacks\" especially at the start when he can only use it a few times. The wizard will likely run out of magic attacks. The spirit bow  you can get a couple of shots in on almost every enemy she fights, back up to break line of sight, and then get 2 surprise attacks with her fist or another bow shot.\n\nCrabs are tough for everyone, but hopefully you will have a better weapon by floor 3 and not using the fists. Once you get a weapon, you can play her like a warrior that has infinite thrown weapons. I always have to be careful with the warrior's rock throws to not have them break on me. Mid game you should definitely not be using fists and at that point, it's still the same. Soften up your target and hit them with whatever weapon rng that you would have found playing another class. In a ranged fight, gnoll shamans outclass every character in a ranged fight lol, so again, I'm not sure why this is a complaint. \n\nI think you are leaning too heavy on the bow and expecting it to carry you. That doesn't mean she's the weakest. All of your issues with enemies are true- for pretty much everyone. \n\nThe rogue can stealth up to several ranges enemies, but it's still probably going to run out of juice. The mage can't outclass a dwarf warlock at range unless you get some good wand rng, but at that point, so would your huntress. The monk is going to parry most physical attacks when focused (not sure if stealth works?) not just arrows. Succubi teleport to everyone and golems teleport everyone....it's all the same. So I'm not sure why the hate, especially with the ease of getting surprise attacks. Being able to mind vision enemies/ see through grass is amazing!\n\n## Comment ID iwpk7y9 with +2 score by [(OraJolly, Reddit, 2022-11-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelDungeon/comments/yx6n40/why_i_think_the_huntress_is_the_weakest_class/iwpk7y9/) (in reply to ID yx6n40):\nYes, I can guarantee it is you, this class is so simple to break and has such a good power ramping as it progresses it's hard to even consider it to be weak.

As in some tests I noticed seems to take around 10-15 minutes for a canary trip to be detected and responded too. Depending on disk/network speeds I feel a lot could be encrypted in that time. Though I dont have any actual ransomware I can test tried to create scripts to kind of test it but probably not very closer to ransomware out in the wild ).

Usually Ransomware isn't something that happens at the moment of breach. Attacker stays on the network, and launches at the best time (worst for us, weekend, holiday, Christmas, etc). Huntress excells in identifying the threats and processes that precede the attack, and therefore stop it, before it happens, in addition to stopping the attack if it gets going. Those two things combined, along with a strong backup plan, should be able to give you some peace of mind.\n\n### Comment ID l038z84 with +21 score by [(andrew-huntress, Reddit, 2024-04-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1c6s72j/huntress_vs_ransomware/l038z84/) (in reply to ID l036fbf):\nYou beat me to it, thank you!\n\nI’ll ask /u/max-huntress (who runs the Huntress SOC) to chime in when he sees this tomorrow, but ransomware canaries are really a last line of defense for when everything else has gone to shit. \n\nWe were much more reliant on them during the early days prior to us rolling out our own EDR to all of our partners.

There are still scenarios where an attacker gets to ransomware but typically this happens in an environment where Huntress isn't fully deployed or the attacker comes in from a vulnerable device (these are rare but do happen).\n\nAt that point our 24x7 SOC will typically Mass Isolate the organization to protect the other systems.

As I dont have ton of endpoints under 500 I have been trying to get the views of those who have a lot more. As thankfully I have not had a major incident. I am a paying customer at this point. However I am one of those people who second guesses there selves on decisions as I have only been in IT for about four years. Also I was the one recommended Huntress to my boss after testing multiple products (from what I could tell from tests low false positives and a decent price compared to others). I mean my boss liked Huntress too but still feel if something were to go wrong it would be my fault.   \n  \nSince Huntress is fairly quite (I have got a few High and Critical alerts from 365 after the major updates but not endpoints excluding some scripting tests) I wonder if I made the right decision since it so quite. To be clear that is not really a problem per say as we run Huntress in tandem with Defender for Business (came with a Microsoft sub we use) which is a lot more noisy usually 10-20 false positive alerts a month. So the product being quite is not really a problem it just raises my anxiety as it makes me wonder if it is doing anything. Please dont take this as a shot at Huntress I have had anxiety issues for awhile and I think it probably just stems from that.   \n  \nI made this post as I figured there are other people who have a lot more endpoints and therefore a lot more experience with how Huntress handles ransomware. One of the hardest things about choosing a EDR solution is just not have a solid way to test it in a real world situation until it is a real world situation. \n\nI greatly appreciate your involvement in the community .

I would think about and research things to reduce the fear factor.\n\nRansomware can and will happen. There is no process that can be implemented, procedure put in place, or technology purchased and configured that will get any online infrastructure's risk to 0 short of turning everything offline and power everything down.\n\nAnd it is okay to acknowledge and accept that. \nIf your boss does not understand that or will not accept that answer then maybe they need more education. Because it simply CAN still happen.\n\nI also think its a mistake to own the responsibility of choosing to go Huntress and worrying about it's abilities. (Not saying Huntress is bad or will not do its job, that is not the point). If you are part of an organization and you contributed part of this but other's such as the owner accepted it then future repurcussions are part of everyone's job. \n\nIf sales or customer facing positions are advocsting 100% cyber security and you will never get hacked the company is just waiting for a bad PR hit when that happens.\n\nIt's also not worth pointing fingers. In an incident the last thing that needs to be done is play the blame game. (Again, Ransomware CAN happen).\n\nBeing prepared and calm when something hits will save you soooo much headache.\n\nI hope you get the technical parts figured out. But don't over stress yourself because you are worried or fearful. Work on a plan and realize you have already setup many mitigations including Huntress. I have worked with their team previously. They will answer your questions with grest knowledge or find someond who can.\n\n### Comment ID l03aa6v with +2 score by [(andrew-huntress, Reddit, 2024-04-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1c6s72j/huntress_vs_ransomware/l03aa6v/) (in reply to ID l038vw0):\n> (I hear they frequent this sub so someone may pop-up.

I can speak to Blackpoint and in the \\~4 years we've been with them we have seen detainment twice for attempted malware/ransomware. The first one they detained the source machine in less than a minute, the second time it was just under 3 minutes.

I changed how I approached it just a little bit and Sophos didn't make a peep after that and I could light up all the files I wanted.  \n\nI'm not slagging sophos-  I'm saying \"don't get cocky\"\n\n  \nOther products didn't seem to care either.

All ransomware is in it's essence is encrypting/locking your files with a password/key. You can run cipher for example on windows and run it on the user profile.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nThe way the canary trips is the checksum changes, so any changes are flagged only when the actual canary files are changed and reported from my understanding. It's like running a search, some files are found before others O(n). So at some point the encryption algorithm will find the canary files and change them. That could be after 10000 files or 1.\n\n## Comment ID l08l82l with +1 score by [(matheusmt1, Reddit, 2024-04-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1c6s72j/huntress_vs_ransomware/l08l82l/) (in reply to ID 1c6s72j):\nWe are new to Huntress and we stack Huntress and SentinelOne together, I created a VM and used theZoo repository of malwares (https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo) to unleash a bunch of malware including various ransomware to test both together and Huntress separately. This was during our trial with Huntress, and we realized Huntress does a lot of things that aid with the prevention of a silent attack, if an invader gets a hold of your system and starts creating hidden services to potentially unleash malware or malicious code at a later time, it's likely that Huntress will catch it before your EDR will (in our case SentinelOne). SentinelOne though is really powerful killing attacks, when I launched malware and ransomware SentinelOne obliterated all of them in no time and even rolled back a few files that got encrypted before it could catch it, Huntress on the other end took 15-20mins to isolate that endpoint and allowed files to be encrypted by the ransomware (when I was running it by itself without SentinelOne).  \nIt was a fun experience that revealed us that Huntress is an amazing product but should not be used by itself :)\n\n### Comment ID l0adyhg with +1 score by [(evilmuffin99, Reddit, 2024-04-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1c6s72j/huntress_vs_ransomware/l0adyhg/) (in reply to ID l08l82l):\nSounds like it should stack well with defender for business.

I collect all the seeds, scrolls, stones, etc. and keep a distance. Swiftness and Wealth really help. Also, a general rule I have is to save Scrolls of Upgrade until your final armor/weapon (tier 5/Plate) There are only so many SoUs in the game and most weapons will end up being sold or left behind. The exception to this is the Whip. If you can find one and sink a bunch of upgrades into it, as well as get Projecting on it, it's a formidable weapon.\n\n### Comment ID h35pfo1 with +1 score by [(WarpedByTheNHK, Reddit, 2021-06-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelDungeon/comments/o7w1sb/whats_your_own_use_of_huntress/h35pfo1/) (in reply to ID h320fy6):\nWhy is the whip good for her when she already has a solid long range weapons that doesn't need upgrade scrolls?

We start getting alerts about user files that contain password.\n\nWe've been using Huntress for almost a year now and this is the first time we received an alert about files that contain passwords. I checked Huntress blogs/updates but could not find info.\n\nThe alert goes:\n\n*\"Huntress detected one or more files on this endpoint that may contain passwords. Having passwords readily available on disk or network shares does not follow security best-practices as threat actors often search for and exploit this data. To reduce organizational risk, we recommend you remove these files and consider the use of a secure password manager.*\r  \n\r  \n*Please note this is a one-time process.

If this is helpful we may consider turning it into an official feature!\n\nEdit: Asked the team why we looked at this. We were looking for evidence of threat actors accessing potential unencrypted credentials and stumbled across the security risk.\n\nOne important distinction - we didn’t scan or download any of these files. We monitor process events via our EDR and saw that a file that looked like a password-containing file was accessed by a user. We didn’t use anything special, purely just looking at files being accessed with password in the name.\n\nEdit 2: We appreciate the feedback! We have some ideas on what we would do differently next time around re: notifications.

YES DEFINITELY. Andrew admits that in this thread. I received the notification today, and although after the fact it is very detailed.\n\nPersonally and for our business, I found these password notifications very helpful.

I don't dilly dally on levels, I try to build a decent selection of items with a focus on damaging items like crit glasses, attack speed, bracelets and on kill synergy items. \n\nI've got a pretty good handle on the game, probably about 600 hours or so. I've got engi to E3 and I've finished monsoon on everything else.\n\nBut the huntress damage is so, so, so unbelievably poor. I have no trouble staying alive with her, triple dash makes that really easy of course but even stacking all the damage sources (watches + armour piercing + crystals + crow bars) it took more than 20 minutes to get mithrix stage 1 down. After getting nowhere with the chimeras I just gave up.\n\nI genuinely don't know how to build her to get her damage to scale.

Part of that may be because I play her more so I’m more used to it, but I think people seriously exaggerate too given so much of your damage in the game comes down to your items.\n\nItemisation aside (other than crowbars - I don’t know why people would consider them to be useful on her when her burst damage isn’t that high compared to her sustain) given you can’t choose your items with consistency, I do have tips:\n\n- the point of huntress is her mobility. People talk about mobility to mean move across the map fast - huntress is just generally untouchable. The three blinks are 3 attacks dodged for free, her special attacks move you higher into the air and can be cancelled, her glaive stops her from falling for a second. You effectively have 5 ways of keeping yourself out of harms way. You need to use them effectively.\n\n- her auto lock on means she should *always* be hitting her intended target. Other survivors may need to turn away from them to run. With huntress, the optimal way to play is to flick your aim on and off the enemy you’re trying to kill in time with when the lock on activates. The pattern should be face enemy > lock on > face away from enemy > arrow(s) get shot > face enemy > lock on… You don’t need to look in the exact opposite direction, but you’ve got time to improve your positioning after every attack, something you can’t do while also dealing damage as other survivors.\n\n- another note on itemisation: her basic damage isn’t that high. The items you’ve listed (watches, armour piercing, focus crystal [insta scrap given you should *never* be close enough to get any benefit from this on huntress]) are all weak damage items to get on her. She needs proc chain items, bleed and crit. Atm it sounds like you’re thinking damage increase items will have a big difference - they won’t. I’m not saying they’re complete crap, but +20% damage on a 3x100% basic attack is nothing compared to a 400% ice band going off every time she uses her 900% alternate special. Obviously an extreme example but still.\n\n### Comment ID jurdhlz with +8 score by [(Herrad, Reddit, 2023-08-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/riskofrain/comments/15hxwbj/how_do_people_actually_play_huntress/jurdhlz/) (in reply to ID jurcbeu):\nYeah I'm scrapping crystals after my last run when I realised for any big enemy you can't even target them in crystal range without gimping your camera.\n\nThose items I listed would be in my take if nothing else category. I do try to play her the same as I would a nail gun Mul-T - procs everywhere.\n\nIt's certainly possible that the seeds were just shit for my last 5 runs or whatever but I've never struggled so consistently with damage the way I seem to on huntress. Even Merc that takes 25 slashes to kill a single whisp I don't struggle as much with. \n\nIf it is just that she's garbage without specific items dropping (thinking bands here) it sort of feels like she's a bit of a shit survivor. I do enjoy using her abilities (even if her special when not cancelled is useless in the later stages because of how vulnerable it makes you). I can't get past the fact that it just feels like her damage or maybe just her damage scaling needs nudging up.\n\n#### Comment ID jurfhaj with +13 score by [(Stem97, Reddit, 2023-08-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/riskofrain/comments/15hxwbj/how_do_people_actually_play_huntress/jurfhaj/) (in reply to ID jurdhlz):\nThat was my point about not focusing on items though - she really doesn’t need specific items. What I’m saying is that proc items are *more valuable* in terms of increasing her damage than just flat damage increase items, not that you need them to succeed.\n\nShe obviously deals more damage to groups than she does to single targets because of her glaive bouncing,  but again, her damage shouldn’t be as atrocious as you make it seem. Add that she can deal her damage in what is arguably the safest way in the game then it gives you a blueprint of how you’re supposed to play her.\n\nIf it’s taking you 20 mins to get through stage 1 of Mithrix, you’re either taking way too long to get to him or you’re not making the most of her kit. Even with really, really bad items it should be taking, *at most*, 10 mins.\n\nShe and Loader completely dominate the speedrun world records, which shows she her items aren’t her be all and end all given that speed runs don’t get that many items.\n\n\n\n### Comment ID juty3mv with +1 score by [(literallyeurope, Reddit, 2023-08-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/riskofrain/comments/15hxwbj/how_do_people_actually_play_huntress/juty3mv/) (in reply to ID jurcbeu):\nI wouldn't say her damage is shit, it's just the lowest, (alongside pdps)out of the cast, so I think a lot of people just equate that to bad lmao\n\n## Comment ID jur66uc with +12 score by [(breitend, Reddit, 2023-08-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/riskofrain/comments/15hxwbj/how_do_people_actually_play_huntress/jur66uc/) (in reply to ID 15hxwbj):\nObviously crit and bleed and stuff are great on huntress but my favorite items to get are gasoline, ignition tank, will o wisp, and ukelele for small enemies and then bands for big enemies/bosses.

She has great aoe with glaive, and can even have decent single target with ballista (if you don’t have ballista, you NEED ballista).\n\n## Comment ID jusuj6z with +2 score by [(yzoes, Reddit, 2023-08-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/riskofrain/comments/15hxwbj/how_do_people_actually_play_huntress/jusuj6z/) (in reply to ID 15hxwbj):\nI unironicly tape down the shoot button. There is absolutely no reason to no be shooting something. Even if there’s something you don’t want to shoot, just look a different direction. With shooting out of the way all you have to focus on is mobility.

It'll help you move around and dodge better.

Since you don't have her alt special, you are missing the most important part of huntress. That will help you immensely. \n\nAnd yes, it is most definitely a skill issue, but you have been handicapping yourself without the alt special. Learn to dodge better, dream for aqueducts every stage 1, learn to roll pots for bands, try full looting. You will get better with her with time.

Get the alternate primary, don’t use triple blink, and go for every on hit in the book.

Use your dashes for movement, not just for dodging enemy attacks. (You can also use it to avoid fall damage) Remember that her secondary skill (Glaive) gives a slight upwards boost, so if you have enough charges, you can technically hover in the air.\n\n**Attacking:** Swinging motions. You have a lock-on that makes you never miss, so Swing your camera so that it locks onto an enemy to attack it, while in the attacking animation you can look anywhere else to look for other enemies or chests. Once the attack animation is done, repeat everything. Don't focus on just one enemy. Though if your attack speed is quick enough don't swing, just attack like you normally would, Just don't look directly at the enemy. (Never make eye contact)\n\n**Skills**: I usually pair Flurry with triple dash and arrow rain. (Though I swap to Ballistic if I know I want to go for a bands run)\n\n**Items**: Don't EVER use Purity, since Huntress doesn't have any Guaranteed DOT application like Bandito you need the extra %-based effects. Besides, Crit chance is also affected by luck. Cooldown reduction isn't going to help you if you can't do Crits or apply effects.\n\nThe items I got for are Crit, movement, attack speed, survivability, chance based and DOT effects (DOT my beloved). This includes Tri-tip daggers, hoof and energy drinks, syringe, predatory instinct, bands, teddy bear, and ukulele.\n\nWhat I've found to work is Flurry paired with bleed, high Crit and attack speed. Trust me, if you go for pure damage you will fall flat. Stacking Crit, watches and attack speed will make a difference, but DOT effects are what give you you're highest damage.\n\nI don't suggest using Glass, as she's already so brittle. Would also suggest getting Ukuleles.\n\n**Equipment** (This is subjective): I like FMP (Forgive me please) and Blast Shower, Missile launcher is good, but what I can do with FMP and Blast is far greater in effect.\n\nFMP: On-kill effects, stack on-kill effects, 2 Power cells and 1 Soul bound catalyst. Object of Life and Death.\n\nBlast Shower: Shower cures all negative effects on the user. Certain Item Cooldowns count as negative effects (Bands and void teddy), so if you have enough Gesture and power cells... :)\n\nHope this gave some insight into how I play Huntress. My most played character.

It's a great combo. The Huntress agent alone finds a lot of stuff (as you are discovering) and MS Defender AV is a great solution. Pairing it with MS Defender For Endpoint/Business makes it even better, even without the Huntress integration (which I'm told is coming soon).\n\nCouple things to keep in mind: \n\n* Microsoft Defender AV (aka Windows Defender) is a PAIN to get going if you have other 3rd party AV solutions on your endpoints. If any other 3rd party AV is installed, Defender AV does not run. This can be a huge task if you're dealing with a lot of endpoints with many years of junk AV. \n* Micrsoft Defender AV is supported on Windows 10+ / Server 2016+. (There is some support for 2012 R2 but you need MDE licensing). \n* macOS devices. I know they are working on integration for Defender For Endpoint, which uses the API to get information so I can't see why it wouldn't include Defender For Endpoint for macOS but there is no AV management. You still need to manage the built in AV somehow (MDM solution?) or have an AV solution you manage/monitor centrally.\n\n### Comment ID l0qyz15 with +7 score by [(Ill_Day7731, Reddit, 2024-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ca9uox/huntress_alone_or_with_antivirus/l0qyz15/) (in reply to ID l0qwtro):\n+1 for the \"Defender is a PAIN to get going if you have any other 3rd party AV\"\n\nWe've had a lot of systems that previously had another AV installed.

Huntress (EDR) + Defender (AV) is a solid option.  Some EDR solutions includes AV, while some do not.\n\nThat said, for me I look at things differently. While Huntress +  Defender is a very solid combo, there are other elements of endpoint security.\n\n* I require the ability to control USB devices. Stock Defender does not do this, and while RMM can be used to push a PS script to disable USB, its very manual, hard to track, and not flexible enough.\n* The ability to support multiple device platforms (Mac, Windows and Linux). At the moment Huntress only supports Windows EDR with Mac EDR in beta.\n* Data Retention of 30 days minimum for EDR logs. Huntress at the moment (last I recall) only has 7 or 14 days of logs.\n\nIf and when Huntress fully supports Defender of Endpoint which has USB Controls and more, I may consider moving to that combo, however at the moment S1 Complete + Huntress works for me, and provides:\n\n* Huntress' EDR and Monitoring\n* S1 Device Control\n* Ability to cover multiple platforms for AV + EDR via S1\n* S1 Rouge Device Detection (Ranger)\n* S1 Application Inventory\n* S1 Flexible Policy Managment per Groups of devices within the same org.\n* A bit of redundancy for manual device containment , and telemetry.\n\nLots of people will have different needs, but you will utlimately need to decide what meets your requirements.\n\nJust sharing in hopes it contribute in some way.\n\n## Comment ID l0ufilc with +2 score by [(bloodpearl, Reddit, 2024-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ca9uox/huntress_alone_or_with_antivirus/l0ufilc/) (in reply to ID 1ca9uox):\nHuntress has caught multiple cryptovirus for us and isolated to product before it could do real damage.\n\n### Comment ID l146sbq with +2 score by [(CamachoGrande, Reddit, 2024-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ca9uox/huntress_alone_or_with_antivirus/l146sbq/) (in reply to ID l0ufilc):\nWhat endpoint security are you running?\n\n#### Comment ID l1491ph with +1 score by [(bloodpearl, Reddit, 2024-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ca9uox/huntress_alone_or_with_antivirus/l1491ph/) (in reply to ID l146sbq):\nWindows defender stock some customers the payed 365 one.\n\nThe crypto was at stock defender client btw\n\n## Comment ID l0wqgks with +2 score by [(stepup511, Reddit, 2024-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ca9uox/huntress_alone_or_with_antivirus/l0wqgks/) (in reply to ID 1ca9uox):\nBitdefender + Huntress is also a good combo.\n\n### Comment ID l1478ar with +1 score by [(CamachoGrande, Reddit, 2024-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ca9uox/huntress_alone_or_with_antivirus/l1478ar/) (in reply to ID l0wqgks):\nWe ran this combination for roughly 1 year.\n\nHuntress was silent the entire time.\n\n#### Comment ID l1482kw with +1 score by [(stepup511, Reddit, 2024-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ca9uox/huntress_alone_or_with_antivirus/l1482kw/) (in reply to ID l1478ar):\nDid you switch away?\n\n## Comment ID l0qygh6 with +2 score by [(Ill_Day7731, Reddit, 2024-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ca9uox/huntress_alone_or_with_antivirus/l0qygh6/) (in reply to ID 1ca9uox):\nHuntress and Defender is the way to go, if you go to Huntress.\n\nFirst off, every (Windows) computer should already have Defender installed.\n\nSecond, Huntress can plug into Defender and act as a set of eyes looking over Defender's shoulder.\n\nThird, if you continue using a solution that was proven to be inadequate, Huntress may not be able to detect the threat in real-time.\n\nFourth, Huntress can enforce rules you specify for Defender.

You'd think that would be priority zero with having an MSP program, but here we are, still closing tickets in 2 places, and experiencing alert fatigue because there isn't a way to auto-resolve \"firewall has not checked in with Sophos central for 5 minutes\".\n\n## Comment ID l0rlf12 with +1 score by [(SamFromHelpt, Reddit, 2024-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ca9uox/huntress_alone_or_with_antivirus/l0rlf12/) (in reply to ID 1ca9uox):\nWe have several clients that use it alone and in combination with defender or threatlocker. My personal believe is go big and use the integrations between the tools so they are not fighting with themselves.\n\n## Comment ID l0s40c9 with +1 score by [(nocturnal, Reddit, 2024-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ca9uox/huntress_alone_or_with_antivirus/l0s40c9/) (in reply to ID 1ca9uox):\nWe use it with s1 complete."

When your sole focus is numbers, people get left behind, forgotten, and abruptly let go. Everyone is terrified for lack of job security and most are trying to find roles elsewhere. In addition, promotions are scarce at best. The most deserving wait years to potentially get promoted, most are still stagnant in their roles while outside hires supersede them. The Huntress product development also was top notch. Recently, the company decided to focus only on sales and encouraged the sales teams to promote products that were not ready. Anyone that challenged this approach was quickly silenced. Care for your employees and product is crucial to success and without it, the company will never be a place I would recommend to anyone.",

          "cons": "I am loathe to have to write this, but I feel like I have to warn prospects and current leaders about the culture at the company (doubt they'll care). Huntress is succeeding despite it's best efforts to sabotage itself. And I want it to succeed.\n\nHuntress's culture has declined to the point that the direction of the company is in the balance. Employees no longer have any loyalty, because of a lack of a feeling of job security. Loyalty and pride used to be main drivers behind employee morale. The pride everyone used to have is waning, as they realize the company does not care about them at all. Employees are feeling like they're just a cog in the wheel.\n\nThe company cycles through leaders in all departments so quickly that there is no loyalty or feeling of job security. Every department's leadership has cycled numerous times in just a few years, except the one that needs a refresh. Once leaders leave, the current employees are no longer supported by the new crew, and many often are cycled out also.\n\nThe company is led by founders without business chops or background. If you don't play their bro game, you're out. They are executing a playbook to cycle out leaders every 12-18 months, a strategy that may have benefits in the short term, but destroys culture and morale. The founders have no clue how to lead or what is needed at each position, and it shows. No sophisticated leader would follow this juvenile strategy. \n\nWhile I do not think it's intentional, the leadership style by the founders is that of fear. Yes, it's their company (although now at Series D, they have board bosses that should step in). Look, the founders had a great idea, designed a sweet product, and built a good company. But, they have not evolved as leaders with the stage of the company. Instead of seeing that, the problem is always someone else. Nobody ever meets their standards, communication is ineffective or nonexistent, and role definitions change or are misunderstood. Instead of bringing people along and up, the founders lead by fear and cycle out bodies for the new shiny toy. Really great, super qualified employees are not up-leveled or refreshed to retain them-the company mindset is apparently we can just go get someone else. Everyone is afraid to disagree or to take initiative, as it's always \"wrong.\" Beloved leaders and employees are being purged for \"the next stage\" -- a next stage that nobody seems to understand. \n\nImportantly, no one feels like they'll be a part of the future they talk about. When founders talk about massive future growth, the eye rolls start as most do not think they'll be a part of it. If the company ever goes public, it will likely do so without anyone who was a part of its growth stages. That is jarring. Only the founders will ring that bell. Other leaders who have the background, chops, and institutional knowledge will have left a company they help grow gangbusters. It's bonkers.\n\nThe culture has suffered. Almost everyone is actively looking for positions elsewhere, and aren't even quiet about it--from those here 6 months to those with 4 years behind them. Largely because they just don't know when they'll get the boot, and the constant stress of long hours and unknown as to whether it's enough (it never is).\n\nIf they did an actual anonymous poll, instead of one where replies can be tracked back (data broken down so granular is not anonymous), they'd get more candid feedback.\n\nFinally, do not believe all of the glowing reviews--the company incentivized people to positively review. \n\nYes, outwardly the branding is cool and the products kick butt. But inwardly, culture is toxic and future perceptions are bleak.\n\nSmoke and mirrors.\n\nThe company needs a pause and reset.",

I am sorry that your experience and thoughts about Huntress are so bleak. \n\nYou raise multiple points and we fully appreciate that they reflect your feelings.  No one can argue or dismiss those.  We noted this post was also cross-posted to Reddit, so the feelings are clearly real and strong.    \n\nWe love transparency and appreciate that Glassdoor asks both teammates and the company to share perspectives.  So we would be remiss to not share some data (which we share with radical transparency at monthly all-company Town Halls so our teammates can personally track the details) and reactions-\n-\tAttrition rates for the year are in the single digits, and trending down. Headcount has grown 2x in the last two years, and we are planning for the same in the next two, because . . . \n-\tEach of our four products are growing at industry-leading rates, and current customer revenue retention rates are a world-class 140%. Suffice to say, our Product dev team is second to none, and, the Huntress secret sauce to developing differentiated, high-value, managed solutions continues to sustain our hyper-growth! Investors have piled boat loads of cash into our cause the last few years for us to continue proliferating the 'Huntress Way' to wrecking hackers. \n-\t90 teammates (~ 1/3 of 1+ yr tenured workforce) have been promoted or earned another career growth opportunity as part of our 2x / yr compensation and promo review process.  Many more than this received merit-based pay adjustments. Every promotion has been shown and celebrated at Town Halls (aka- “Movers &amp; Shakers”) so all teammates know who they are.\n-\tAlso, every name &amp; face of our 150+ hires and the handful of leavers have also been shown, so all teammates can clearly track who’s coming and going. \n-\tWe recently won an Inc. best places to work award (granted exclusively on employee feedback from a survey they ran).  Our recent semi-annual anonymous (guaranteed by the vendor we utilize) survey showed a huge leap in employee net promotor score (58 - considered top tier in tech industry) \n-\tFollowing our anonymous in-house surveys, we ask people to post externally to Glassdoor (aka- “You’ve shared your voice with us in this survey; now we ask that you tell the world”).  We encourage people to post transparently and authentically how they are feeling- not directing what to say.  And of course there’s no way to incentivize posts with it all being anonymous.\n\nIn summary, every data point shared here is shared with all teammates monthly, as we embrace radical transparency.  In short, our BA hacker talent has driven extraordinary growth, enabling us to continually invest more into growing our teammates, and there’s no end in site.  Two things have remained true for nine years and will continue:\n*Hackers gonna hack.\n*Huntress gonna hunt.",

If you thrive on always being on and available this is the place for you, literally you best be okay with putting in evening and weekend hours consistently because “that’s just how it is working at a startup.” weird exec comments on company all hands to justify the crazy work that makes it sound like they’re primarily looking out for themselves and their pocketbooks. Diversity is a thing in a select few teams but not so much for others. Also very much felt like old guard vs new guard while I was there and the “new” wasn’t as respected as those who had been there since the beginning and they got a pass for being rude and demeaning to teammates because it’s just who they are. Wouldn’t be surprised if this review is followed up with some internal stats to justify what they do. They’re still growing because they have a legit product and customers legit love them but the way you’re expected to sacrifice your personal life for them and the mind games are not worth it.

For my department there are almost as many managers as there are workers, with managers earning 2-4x as much as workers. Over half the open jobs right now are managerial. Because of the low pay, some departments are always understaffed, which also conveniently leaves you stuck in a low paying position because they can't afford to replace you hard work is not rewarded so many just do the bare minimum education assistance is refunded, so if you don't have a few grand laying around for education you're SOL. You know who needs education assistance the most? People in your low paying positions, people without the spare money to pay for education up front. some positions pay far under the current market rate. Their favorite trick is to write your job description for a high level position, but then give you a lower title so they can claim they are paying market rate based on the title.",

You reported being one of our few 3+ yr employees (most of our growth has occurred in the last 18 months), so you were here when we were in our early-stages of growth, and our very small team met regularly with the Founders who have come to know you personally.  In your tenure, you’ve seen our explosive growth to 250+ global teammates, and participated in 36+ Town Halls, our twice annual all-employee Summits, and a multitude of Slack collaboration.  We work really hard to personify our TRANSPARENCY value, regularly looking at ourselves in the mirror, and engaging in open dialogue about our gaps and how we can collectively address them.\n\nSo your comments are surprising and disappointing.  As we recently shared companywide, our global teammates rated our culture significantly above industry benchmark in almost every question, and reflected continual improvement in nearly every category. \n\nSince our founding, you’ve seen the only reason we’ve managed to continually grow 2x/year is through open dialogue.

I love that we are a truly remote company. My teammates really care about the business and the work we do, I feel like I have a good support network here.",

For my department there are almost as many managers as there are workers, with managers earning 2-4x as much as workers. Over half the open jobs right now are managerial. Because of the low pay, some departments are always understaffed, which also conveniently leaves you stuck in a low paying position because they can't afford to replace you hard work is not rewarded so many just do the bare minimum education assistance is refunded, so if you don't have a few grand laying around for education you're SOL. You know who needs education assistance the most? People in your low paying positions, people without the spare money to pay for education up front. some positions pay far under the current market rate.

If you thrive on always being on and available this is the place for you, literally you best be okay with putting in evening and weekend hours consistently because “that’s just how it is working at a startup.” weird exec comments on company all hands to justify the crazy work that makes it sound like they’re primarily looking out for themselves and their pocketbooks. Diversity is a thing in a select few teams but not so much for others. Also very much felt like old guard vs new guard while I was there and the “new” wasn’t as respected as those who had been there since the beginning and they got a pass for being rude and demeaning to teammates because it’s just who they are. Wouldn’t be surprised if this review is followed up with some internal stats to justify what they do. They’re still growing because they have a legit product and customers legit love them but the way you’re expected to sacrifice your personal life for them and the mind games are not worth it. There’s also a ton of senior leadership and not enough people doing the work.",

        "cons": "I am loathe to have to write this, but I feel like I have to warn prospects and current leaders about the culture at the company (doubt they'll care). Huntress is succeeding despite it's best efforts to sabotage itself. And I want it to succeed.\n\nHuntress's culture has declined to the point that the direction of the company is in the balance. Employees no longer have any loyalty, because of a lack of a feeling of job security. Loyalty and pride used to be main drivers behind employee morale. The pride everyone used to have is waning, as they realize the company does not care about them at all. Employees are feeling like they're just a cog in the wheel.\n\nThe company cycles through leaders in all departments so quickly that there is no loyalty or feeling of job security. Every department's leadership has cycled numerous times in just a few years, except the one that needs a refresh. Once leaders leave, the current employees are no longer supported by the new crew, and many often are cycled out also.\n\nThe company is led by founders without business chops or background. If you don't play their bro game, you're out. They are executing a playbook to cycle out leaders every 12-18 months, a strategy that may have benefits in the short term, but destroys culture and morale. The founders have no clue how to lead or what is needed at each position, and it shows. No sophisticated leader would follow this juvenile strategy. \n\nWhile I do not think it's intentional, the leadership style by the founders is that of fear. Yes, it's their company (although now at Series D, they have board bosses that should step in). Look, the founders had a great idea, designed a sweet product, and built a good company. But, they have not evolved as leaders with the stage of the company. Instead of seeing that, the problem is always someone else. Nobody ever meets their standards, communication is ineffective or nonexistent, and role definitions change or are misunderstood. Instead of bringing people along and up, the founders lead by fear and cycle out bodies for the new shiny toy. Really great, super qualified employees are not up-leveled or refreshed to retain them-the company mindset is apparently we can just go get someone else. Everyone is afraid to disagree or to take initiative, as it's always \"wrong.\" Beloved leaders and employees are being purged for \"the next stage\" -- a next stage that nobody seems to understand. \n\nImportantly, no one feels like they'll be a part of the future they talk about. When founders talk about massive future growth, the eye rolls start as most do not think they'll be a part of it. If the company ever goes public, it will likely do so without anyone who was a part of its growth stages. That is jarring. Only the founders will ring that bell. Other leaders who have the background, chops, and institutional knowledge will have left a company they help grow gangbusters. It's bonkers.\n\nThe culture has suffered. Almost everyone is actively looking for positions elsewhere, and aren't even quiet about it--from those here 6 months to those with 4 years behind them. Largely because they just don't know when they'll get the boot, and the constant stress of long hours and unknown as to whether it's enough (it never is).\n\nIf they did an actual anonymous poll, instead of one where replies can be tracked back (data broken down so granular is not anonymous), they'd get more candid feedback.\n\nFinally, do not believe all of the glowing reviews--the company incentivized people to positively review. \n\nYes, outwardly the branding is cool and the products kick butt. But inwardly, culture is toxic and future perceptions are bleak.\n\nSmoke and mirrors.\n\nThe company needs a pause and reset.",

This is the ‘why’ that supercharges my team to work around the clock and democratize access to the tools and talent typically built for the enterprise,” said co-founder and CEO Kyle Hanslovan in a release.\n\nHuntress currently is realizing more than 70% year-to-year revenue growth for the past two years as it continues to “approach $100 million in annual recurring revenue.”\n\nFounded in 2015, Huntress has raised nearly $310 million, per Crunchbase.\n\nCyber funding\n\nHuntress’ fresh round is just the latest big cybersecurity round in a Q2 where funding has taken off.\n\nWith a couple of weeks still remaining in the quarter, cyber startups have raised $4.1 billion in 141 deals, per Crunchbase data. That far outpaces Q1’s numbers, when such startups raised $2.7 billion in 140 deals and smashes last year’s Q2 totals of $1.8 billion in 192 deals.\n\nOf course, this year’s Q2 numbers are helped out immensely by cloud security startup Wiz’s big announcement in May that it had raised $1 billion at a $12 billion valuation. That round is still the biggest in cybersecurity this year.\n\nOverall funding for the year is currently well ahead of this same point last year.\n\nRelated Crunchbase Pro query:\n\nCybersecurity Funding\n\nRelated reading:\n\nHuntress Tracks Down $40M Series B To Secure SMBs\n\nCloud Security Firm Wiz Raises $1B At $12B Valuation",

      "# [Huntress Surpasses $100M ARR](https://www.huntress.com/press-release/100m-arr)\nRapidly expands its platform capabilities and enters new geographies and vertical markets to defend businesses under attack worldwide\n\nâCOLUMBIA, MD - September 16, 2024 - Huntress, the pioneering force in cybersecurity for small and mid-sized enterprises and the service providers that support them, announced today it has reached $100M in annual recurring revenue (ARR), achieving Centaur status. This milestone highlights the importance of the companyâs mission: to break down barriers to enterprise-grade security. Huntress currently secures more than 3 million endpoints, protects more than 1 million identities, and defends more than 120,000 businesses, fortifying the critical market that makes up the backbone of the global economy.Â\n\nâWeâre grateful for the recognition this milestone brings, but the real validation comes from our partners and SMBs whoâve supported our mission all along. Theyâre under serious pressure as hackers step up their game, stealing credentials from endpoints in minutes and quickly targeting cloud-based SaaS apps,â said Kyle Hanslovan, CEO and Co-Founder of Huntress. âHuntress and the broader security community have definitely raised the stakes against these bad actors, but tackling their shady tactics that threaten small businesses daily is an ongoing battle. We wonât budge in our commitment to this fight, even beyond this new milestone.âÂ Â\n\nâWhen we first invested four and a half years ago, it was clear Kyle, Chris, and Huntress were on to something â to bring enterprise-grade cybersecurity to the vast yet largely ignored market of millions of SMBs,\" said Ernie Bio, Managing Director at Forgepoint Capital. \"The progress theyâve made since then is astounding â both headcount and ARR increased over 20x. As they continue to expand their platform capabilities and scale into new geographies, theyâve maintained that same maniacal focus on customers and partners. I have never seen a more mission-focused team.â\n\nâBuilding With Intention for Every Business, Not Just the 1%\n\nAggression from cybercriminals towards small to mid-sized enterprises has never been more intense. As a result, any entry-level hacker with access to the dark web can now easily buy access to and data from compromised businesses, putting company dataâand employee livelihoodsâat risk. To beat hackers at their own game, Huntress has evolved from a single-product provider into a multi-product cybersecurity leader. Its game-changing Managed Security Platform combines a purpose-built Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR), Security Awareness Training (SAT), and a newly launched Security Information and Event Management (SIEM). This unique and powerful combination also includes 24/7 monitoring by an elite team of human threat hunters to stop attacks software-only solutions miss.\n\nâImpressive Growth Trajectory",
      "# [2023: A Remarkable Year of Achievements and Milestones for Huntress by Huntress Labs on 2024-01-03](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2023-remarkable-achievements-milestones-huntress-130000176.html)\nHigh growth, new technology innovations, a Series C investment round, and industry achievements and awards that all position Huntress as the leader in cybersecurity for SMBs and the mid-market\n\nELLICOTT CITY, Md., Jan. 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Huntress, the managed security platform for small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) and the service providers that secure them, today announced a strong close to 2023, marked by continued company growth, global expansion, increased MSP partner and SMB customer adoption, innovative new product offerings, and several awards and achievements.\n\nIn 2023, Huntress achieved over $70M in ARR, a $60 million Series C investment round led by Sapphire Ventures, with participation from existing investors Forgepoint Capital, and JMI Equity. Myrna Soto, former CISO for Comcast Corporation, and a cybersecurity industry veteran, was elected to Huntress’s Board of Directors, and the company expanded globally in ANZ and Europe.\n\n“2023 was an epic year for us as we significantly increased the number of MSPs joining the fight against the cyber criminals devastating small and mid-sized businesses. While our ThreatOps and SOC teams were working tirelessly to prepare for the inbound tidal wave of identity-focused tradecraft, we were developing our new MDR for Microsoft 365 product to combat business email compromise (BEC), account takeover tactics techniques and procedures (TTPs). The momentum propelling us forward makes me even more confident in our future,” said Kyle Hanslovan, CEO at Huntress.\n\nAs a result of its dedication to the MSP channel and SMBs, Huntress and its employees received prestigious awards including CRN’s Women on the Rise and Top 100 Executives, The Fortress 2023 Cybersecurity Award, and Inc.’s 2023 Power Partner for Cybersecurity.\n\n“As cybercrime continues to grow and as threat actors continue to get more sophisticated in their attacks, the need for cybersecurity has never been greater. That’s especially the case for SMBs, which are often first impacted and most underserved. Huntress's focus on SMBs and the mid-market is a core differentiator that truly sets them apart, and their growth speaks for itself. We couldn’t be more excited to partner with the Huntress team on its mission to elevate the security of the 99%,” said Casber Wang, Partner at Sapphire Ventures.\n\nNotably, Huntress delivered new product and technology innovations including:\n\nThe launch of MDR for Microsoft 365 which is already protecting hundreds of thousands of identities and was awarded CRN’s 2023 Product of the Year Award for its ability to protect resource-strapped SMBs and mid-market companies against costly business email compromise (BEC) and account takeover attacks.\n\nHuntress Security Awareness Training (SAT) is now leading in the market with new and engaging content as a result of company’s Curricula acquisition, and is offered as a fully managed service - including managed phishing - that only takes 3-minutes to set up.\n\nCompliance with SOC2, GDPR, and CCPA regulations further highlighting the company’s commitment to data security and customer trust and support our expansion into overseas markets.\n\nEarly detection of 2023’s major threats including CVE-2023-23397, 3CX, MOVEit and PaperCut showcasing our ability to product actionable security research that is relevant to SMBs that are disproportionately affected by these threats.\n\nNew Managed EDR features, including auto-remediation for low-severity threats and incident notifications via SMS texts & calls.",
      "# [Huntress CEO On Raising $150M To ‘Democratize’ SIEM, Data Protection For SMBs by Kyle Alspach](https://www.crn.com/news/security/2024/huntress-ceo-on-raising-150m-to-democratize-siem-data-protection-for-smbs)\nKyle Hanslovan tells CRN that the funding round—which more than doubles Huntress’ valuation to surpass $1.5 billion—will boost the company’s R&D and M&A efforts with a focus on key segments for partners.\n\nHuntress announced Tuesday it has raised $150 million in funding to accelerate its expansion into new product segments, as part of a drive to spur growth for partners and better secure their SMB customers, Huntress Co-Founder and CEO Kyle Hanslovan told CRN.\n\nThe SMB-focused managed cybersecurity vendor is planning to move into SIEM (security information and event management) and is eyeing additional categories such as security posture management, as well as offerings that will “reinvent” data backup and recovery, Hanslovan said.\n\n[Related: The 20 Coolest Endpoint And Managed Security Companies Of 2024]\n\nThe expansion moves come as “the pace that the threat actors in cybercrime have pivoted towards SMBs [has] not slowed,” he said. “I've just had to stop and say, ‘I cannot just wait for where hackers are going to go next.’”\n\nThe new funding brings unicorn status to Huntress, more than doubling the company’s valuation to surpass $1.5 billion. The round is also a greater amount of funding than the previous total that’d been raised by the company since its launch in 2015, bringing Huntress to $268 million raised to date.\n\nThe Series D round was led by two new investors, Kleiner Perkins and Meritech Capital, as well as by existing backer Sapphire Ventures. Winning the backing of these Silicon Valley venture luminaries is a huge validation for Huntress’ approach of focusing on working with partners to meet the security needs of under-protected SMBs, Hanslovan told CRN.\n\nNow, “we’ve got three of the top five growth-stage VCs backing us,” he said. Additionally, “this is the last round that would likely happen” prior to an initial public offering for Huntress.\n\n“This is all preparing for the future IPO,” Hanslovan said.\n\nHalf of the funding or more will be targeted toward R&D and M&A, he noted. “The other half is going to be tons of education, awareness, go-to-market [investments].”\n\nHuntress reached $70 million in annual recurring revenue in 2023 and expects to cross $100 million in ARR later this year, Hanslovan said. In terms of headcount, the company currently employs 360 and will likely surpass 400 by the end of the year, he said.\n\nUltimately, “one of my biggest efforts with this new approach—both for SIEM as well as the security posture management and the backup-recovery—I'm trying to democratize [security capabilities],” Hanslovan said. “So when somebody gets our implementation, it can be rolled out to every customer. The biggest thing that I'm doing [is] democratizing.”\n\nWhat follows is an edited and condensed portion of CRN’s interview with Hanslovan.\n\nWhat prompted you to raise more funding now and what are the major goals for it?\n\nI've been just really stressing about the pace that the threat actors in cybercrime have pivoted towards SMBs — it's not slowed. And the amount of attack service they're now starting to go after [has grown].\n\nWe have 14,000 healthcare companies [as customers] — the vast majority of them on that United / Change Healthcare network that were being impacted by not being able to either submit claims or get reimbursed. So I have first-hand, direct experience of where people are getting wrecked. And I've just had to stop and say, “I cannot just wait for where hackers are going to go next.”\n\nOf course I love the detection and response lane. I now have ITDR — identity threat detection and response. That's the [Microsoft] 365, G Suite, SaaS-based detection and response. That's great. And during our Series C, I said we were going to go from a one-product company to a many-product company.\n\nEmployees are obviously another thing threat actors [are targeting]. So I’ve got now my foothold in [that] market through awareness training, phishing simulation.\n\nI am about to rip the market open on security posture management. I'm just hearing it all over. I'm ripping into that whole security posture lane of products.\n\nAre you interested in looking at more acquisitions?\n\nI might be doing some M&A on [categories like] security posture management on SaaS apps, security posture management of the cloud. There's a huge opportunity over there. But I'm looking at these backup products and I don't think I'm going to do M&A over there. I've looked at a couple companies. [But] none of my clients come and say, “I need a technology that I can run a backup and manually store.” The things that I'm hearing are, “If you know where my files are ransomed, why aren’t you automatically restoring my files with no interaction? Why isn't that being done autonomously?” And when [an attacker] slipped by, now let me automate the recovery on this. We're really going to try to reinvent backup. We're going to try to really blow this up and build a data recovery solution and a continuity solution — [where] I might have to use the old school words of backup and recovery — but they're just fundamentally not going to look like what [today’s backup products] are doing.\n\nCould you say a bit more on where else your R&D efforts will be focused?\n\nPartners want to own a lot of the security process. For a very long time our partner base was saying, “You elevate to me what the problem is, but I want to own taking the response. I want to own that relationship.” A lot of our partners are starting to see what we've been warning of — if you don't give up a little bit more autonomy to your SOC that's taking care of this for you, we can't make you look like the rock star. So one of the biggest things I'm looking at doing is, I'm trying to completely push the boundaries on not only what should an outside team be able to do on your behalf — but how do they escalate? We're trying to make our products [become] much more fully automated on their behalf.\n\nI finally now have the platform infrastructure I built [after the last funding round]. And you're going to see a lot more research and development and new stuff for our partners that's going to make their whole stack automatically collaborate with each other. Where we want to push the bounds with our research is, imagine if you see credentials stolen off an endpoint — why can't I automatically lock down the SaaS identities that are there? Or vice versa — somebody falls for a phishing email, why can't I automatically cue up the education and training to help prevent that from happening in the future? This is how a real platform is supposed to interoperate. I'm continuing to bring that enterprise-quality tech but really pairing it with enterprise-quality humans.\n\nAnd that's actually solving the biggest hurdles. Our partners continue to tell me, “I have more attack surface than I can handle. I cannot staff these more senior IT and security people. And I want you to make my most junior IT people into the rock stars.”\n\nAre there other product segments you’re interested in?\n\nSIEM has been a solution that most people only roll out to part of their base. When I go talk to my partners, one story sounds like this: 30 percent of my base gets it, but I only give it to the customers that are willing to pay [for] the premium platform. It's never the doctor’s and dentist’s office that actually need it. It's never the community waterworks or rural electricity company, that actually is a small business itself. Those are never the people with the budget. So one of my biggest efforts with this new approach — both for SIEM as well as the security posture management and the backup-recovery — I'm trying to democratize [security capabilities]. So when somebody gets our implementation, it can be rolled out to every customer. The biggest thing that I'm doing [is] democratizing.\n\nOur [customers] need something that can outrun hackers. But they don't have the budget and the team to maintain a Formula One car. So what Huntress is building is a high-end sports car. We're effectively building a Lamborghini. I'm just in the business of high-end sports cars but I also know what I'm not.\n\nPart of building this for the SMB is being laser-focused on, what do they truly need? Let's build the high-end sports cars for the small business to the small enterprise, and leave the Formula One cars to the Fortune 5000.\n\nAny other ways this funding might help to drive growth for partners?\n\nI'm just starting to realize how much of the market my channel partners don't already have. I am doubling down on a ton of demand gen to bring more of this SMB into my partners. We still haven't changed. We're still channel-first. So even when we do direct marketing, we always give that customer [to the partner]. The question we ask is, “Who would you like to fulfill through.” So we're trying to continue building more and more and bringing that demand into our partners.",

      "# [Huntress warns of attacks on Foundation Software accounts by Arielle Waldman, Alex Scroxton, Ben Lutkevich, Ed Moyle on 2024-09-18](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/366611274/Huntress-warns-of-attacks-on-Foundation-Software-accounts)\nHuntress warned that attackers are targeting the construction industry with brute force attacks against accounting software accounts with default credentials.\n\nIn a blog post published Tuesday, the cybersecurity vendor detailed an emerging brute force attack campaign it first observed Sept. 14. The campaign is targeting customers of Foundation Software, which is commonly used in the construction industry for financial reporting and billing forms.\n\nMax Rogers, senior director of Huntress' threat operations center, flagged suspicious activity Sept. 14 in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Rogers said Huntress was seeing \"wide-spread attacks against Construction companies.\"\n\nAfter detecting suspicious activity, Huntress said it isolated affected machines and initiated an investigation. Additionally, the company notified any affected individuals and sent a \"precautionary advisory\" to any Huntress customer who uses Foundation in their environment.\n\nThe attack scope may be limited for now. Huntress said it discovered around 500 hosts running the Foundation software and that 33 of them were publicly exposed with unchanged default credentials. John Hammond, principal security researcher at Huntress, told TechTarget Editorial that although the numbers may appear small, there are third-party risks to consider as affected customers may internal connections to other organizations.\n\nThose concerns particularly apply to the 33 hosts with unchanged default passwords. Hammond said the security shortcoming provides attackers with \"immediate and open-door access.\" The blog post expanded on the scope and affected industries.\n\n\"Attackers have been observed brute forcing the software at scale, and gaining access simply by using the product's default credentials. We're seeing active intrusions among plumbing, HVAC, concrete, and similar sub-industries,\" Huntress wrote in the blog post.\n\nHuntress stated the attack takes advantage of publicly facing Foundation instances. Foundation uses the Microsoft SQL Server, which Huntress said is a database that includes a default system administrator account. If attackers compromise the account, dubbed \"sa,\" they can gain full administrative privileges over the entire server.\n\nHuntress observed that many high-privilege sa accounts still use default credentials, which unknown threat actors compromised through brute force attacks. Once threat actors access the accounts, they can use a feature called \"xp_cmdshell\" within SQL Server, which enables users to run operating system commands and scripts.\n\n\"On one host we observed ~35,000 brute force login attempts against the MSSQL server ending just an hour before a successful authentication and enabling xp_cmdshell to run commands,\" the blog post said.\n\nHuntress recommended that users rotate credentials for accounts connected to the Foundation database, disable xp_cmdshell if possible, and remove the application from the public internet wherever possible.\n\nTracie Kuczkowski, vice president of marketing at Foundation, sent the following statement to TechTarget Editorial:\n\n\"The event potentially impacted a small subset of on-premise FOUNDATION users. It did not at all impact the bulk of our accounting users, which are under our secure, cloud-based SaaS offering. It also did not impact our internal systems or any of our other product offerings through our subsidiary companies. As a result of not following recommendations and security best practices that were provided (one example being not resetting the default credentials), this small subset of on-premise users might face possible vulnerabilities. We have been communicating and providing technical support to these users to mitigate this.\"\n\nKuczkowski also said that Foundation is currently working with Huntress to \"correct the information they have posted.\"\n\nHammond provided TechTarget Editorial with more details on the disclosure process with Foundation. \"Huntress attempted to reach out to Foundation throughout the weekend but had not received a response until Monday. Speaking over the phone, Foundation confirmed the default credentials that we saw abused and that they had received reports from a small number of their customers,\" he said. \"They confirmed this was a default configuration for on-premises installations of the Foundation software.\"\n\nHammond also confirmed that communication with Foundation is ongoing.\n\n\"Huntress was in contact with Foundation as recently as yesterday. Over email, Foundation had asked for more specific statements to be included, suggesting their customers should follow their best practices and recommendations,\" he said. \"Upon asking Foundation for a link to their best practices guide & documentation, Huntress has not received a response.\"",

This customer fanbase puts Huntress at the doorstep of becoming a centaur in cybersecurity as they approach $100M ARR and nearly 3.5 million endpoints and identities protected.\n\nEmpowering Businesses with Comprehensive Security\n\nThe Huntress Managed Security Platform empowers businesses by combining a purpose-built platform comprised of Endpoint Detection and Response, Identity Threat Detection and Response, Security Awareness Training, and a much-anticipated SIEM, with a world-class, expert Security Operations Center (SOC) that offers around-the-clock coverage with human expertise that software-only solutions can’t match.\n\nSupporting Quotes\n\nCasber Wang, Sapphire Ventures: “Huntress has emerged as a clear outlier in a world where SMBs, the foundation of our global economy, have been chronically underserved. Since leading the company's Series C, we've witnessed first-hand the relentless dedication Huntress brings to elevating the security of SMBs through its platform and people. Their customers are also their biggest fans — just one of several reasons why we're thrilled to deepen our commitment with Kyle and the Huntress team on this next phase of growth.\"\n\nEverett Randle, Kleiner Perkins: \"From our very first meeting, it was clear that Kyle and the Huntress team had a profound understanding of and empathy for their customers and partners. Combined with their passion for building remarkable products, the team has created a rapidly growing cybersecurity platform supported by a large & fiercely loyal community. We’re thrilled to support the team as they accelerate their ability to innovate & ship products that serve this historically neglected market.\"\n\nAlex Kurland, Meritech Capital: “Since its inception, Huntress has been steadfast in its mission to elevate and empower businesses, and their mission has proven successful.

      "# [Huntress raises $150M at $1.5B+ valuation for its managed cybersecurity platform by MARIA DEUTSCHER, CHERYL KNIGHT, JAMES FARRELL, MIKE WHEATLEY, DUNCAN RILEY on 2024-06-18](https://siliconangle.com/2024/06/18/huntress-raises-150m-1-5b-valuation-managed-cybersecurity-platform/)\nHuntress Labs Inc., a fast-growing managed cybersecurity provider, today disclosed that it has raised $150 million at a valuation exceeding $1.5 billion.\n\nKleiner Perkins, Meritech Capital and Sapphire Ventures led the round. CRN reported that the raise, a Series D investment, is likely the last for Huntress before going public. The company is reportedly on track to end the year with more than $100 million in annual recurring revenue.\n\nFounded in 2015, Huntress provides a managed cybersecurity platform for small and medium-sized businesses. The platform can spot vulnerabilities in a company’s technology environment, as well as attempts by hackers to exploit those vulnerabilities. When a cyberattack is detected, Huntress’ cybersecurity professionals investigate the incident and remediate it on behalf of the affected company.\n\n“Everyone deserves the ability to protect themselves and their employees’ livelihoods,” said Huntress Chief Executive Officer Kyle Hanslovan (pictured, center, with co-founders Chris Bisnett and John Ferrell). “This is the ‘why’ that supercharges my team to work around the clock and democratize access to the tools and talent typically built for the enterprise.”\n\nOne of the tasks that Huntress’ platform promises to ease is mitigating ransomware attacks. It deploys small files, or canaries, throughout a company’s network that function as ransomware sensors. If hackers attempt to encrypt one of the files, the platform notifies Huntress’ cybersecurity professionals.\n\nSome cyberattacks are carried out using not malware but rather the existing, legitimate applications used by a company’s employees. Huntress says that its platform can detect such breach attempts. It also spots vulnerabilities that might lead to cyberattacks in the future, such as open network ports that allow traffic from external websites to reach a company’s internal infrastructure.\n\nHuntress provides its core threat detection and remediation features alongside a cybersecurity training tool. According to the company, the tool allows organizations to send simulated phishing emails to their employees. If a worker clicks on a link in one of the messages, Huntress’ platform displays educational content on how to spot phishing campaigns.\n\nThe company says that its revenue has grown by over 70% in each of the past two years thanks to strong demand. According to Huntress, customers are now using its software to protect nearly 3.5 million systems and user accounts.\n\nTo maintain its sales momentum, the company will spend a portion of its newly raised capital on expanding its go-to-market team. In parallel, Huntress plans to enhance its feature set and explore acquisition opportunities. It intends to buy companies with technology that eases cybersecurity tasks such as detecting infrastructure vulnerabilities.\n\nPhoto: Huntress",
