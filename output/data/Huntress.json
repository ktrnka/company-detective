      "# [Triangulation](https://www.huntress.com/blog/triangulation)\nOnce upon a time, I had my butt handed to me in a post-incident response debrief.\n\nI thought it was a good report. It was actually one of my first, many years ago.\n\nHowever, one or two executives in that debrief session began to question the credibility of the report. “Why wasn’t it one hundred pages?”, and “how could you say for sure something happened during a window of time?”, and even “how can we be sure you’ve given this your full attention?”\n\nSmelling blood in the water, one dissenting voice turned into a frenzy of sharks all trying to take a chunk of my derriere. The rest of that session was not spent explaining the nuance of their intrusion, but instead re-gaining the trust, credibility and confidence that my report had failed to instill in the client after their incident.\n\nAn unlucky constellation of factors meant one of my first IR reports was not well-received. Some of it was my inexperience and very apparent youth. A major failing was that I had not used the report to its full potential; I had failed to use the report to establish the impression of credibility in my reader.\n\nTriangulating for Credibility\n\nWe are intertwined in our incident reports, our summary of new zero-days, our Twitter threads. A bit of ego and vanity goes into technical writing, and any doubt about the efficacy of what we are writing is, by extension, a doubt of our credibility.\n\nI don’t want you to flail at the first hit of criticism. Instead, I want you to protect your vanity and reputation by leaving your reader with zero doubt that you are an expert who makes well-founded, evidence-driven conclusions. With and through evidence, you’ll be speaking with impeccable authority.\n\nTriangulation is an investigative concept from the social sciences we can kindly borrow and transpose. Here, the investigator enriches the validity and reliability of their claims by leveraging multiple methods and layering evidence from multiple sources of data that all speak to the same phenomenon.\n\nPut more specifically for infosec folk, triangulating involves using multiple sources of telemetry on a machine to hone in one theory at a time to disprove or prove it.\n\nAfter that terrible debrief session, I changed the way I wrote. Triangulation was one of many techniques I deployed to ensure a reader received (implicitly or explicitly) the impression that this report was as close to fact as possible, and I was an investigator of good repute and attentiveness.\n\nNow, you and I know that I am a clown (if not the whole circus) for most things, even if your only exposure to me has been through my blogs. But not when it comes to reports—I mean business when I write reports. And I would like you to also mean business when you write your reports.\n\nI would like you to write technical reports that contain zero assumptions or assertions and instead act as your own first-layer peer-reviewer. You can triangulate your findings to corroborate your hypotheses, theories and ideas, and produce reports that convey unshakable confidence in your reader as well as contain technical excellence.\n\nTriangulation IRL\n\nWhen have I ever given you the recipe without bringing something fresh out the kitchen too? We’ll use a real case as an example of how triangulation can be used in real investigations.\n\nJust the other day, my colleague Cat Contillo and I found some spare time to do some honest security work. We had an alert come through that was a bit too vague for our liking, so we decided to flesh it out and make a report for the partner that had a good context with even better actionable findings.\n\nWe’re rarely so fortunate to have good security-enabled Windows Event logs on any given machine. On this occasion, Cat and I didn’t find much from the logs, but we did leverage some digital forensic artefacts to mount our investigation from.\n\nThe alert we received was about potential lateral movement that ended up being PsExec. We could have just sent a generic report that did the bare minimum of communicating a threat….but that’s not our style. Instead, we leveraged a number of data sources in order to tell a far more detailed, convincing story that offered the partner confidence in our report and our recommendations.\n\nTo triangulate PsExec, I’ll recreate our investigation and show you a couple of cool artefacts we can collect, contrast and compare:\n\nThe Windows registry data related to PsExec\n\nThe record from Background Activity Moderator (BAM)\n\nThe frequency of execution from Prefetch\n\nA Moment on PsExec\n\nOur enquiry should lead with a good foundation of the phenomenon we want to study. So let’s dwell on PsExec for a moment.\n\nPsExec is a legitimate system administration tool as much as it is a tool for adversaries to laterally move in a domain. In our example for this article, when we launch PsExec from our host machine (Thornfield), we’re creating a remote session in the target machine (MoorHouse), and gain an interactive session with our ‘JEyre’ user.\n\nSimplified explanation. For greater detail, please read ExtraHops' blog post.\n\nAn unappreciated part of PsExec is the reciprocating agent that ephemerally appears on the target machine.\n\nMonitoring for PsExeSVC.exe to pop up somewhere in your environment is a great opportunity for detection. A PsExec connection will instigate an EventID 7045 (Service) on the target machine’s System.evtx for PsExeSVC. It will offer the connection time for us to focus on, as well as confirm the user account via SID (which I’ll show you how to convert in a minute).\n\nBut note, adversaries can control the service name by using the `-r` flag on PsExec, and is therefore not a foolproof method of detection.\n\nNow we have spent some time on PsExec and gathered ourselves a few basic facts about investigating, let's take it up a notch and see what artefacts we can triangulate to tell a fuller story.\n\nEULA Accepted in the Registry\n\nAttackers can try to change the name of the PsExec executable itself to evade detection, but something they’re less likely to evade will be the impact on the Windows registry.\n\nWe can take a look in our registry for the EulaAccepted, which will appear with the value of ‘1’ if PsExec has been dropped on this machine and the EULA pop-up has been accepted.\n\nWe can look across the registry from HKEY_USERS to identify which user accounts (via their SIDs) have leveraged PsExec.\n\nHKEY_USERS\\S-*\\Software\\Sysinternals\\PsExec\n\nHowever, notice we don’t get a corresponding username gifted to us. Instead, we get the long SID string. To convert that to a username, try this:\n\n‍\n\nOr over-engineer a solution!\n\nAn issue with wrapping up our investigation here and now is that we have no clue when the registry was changed / when and if PsExec was actually executed.\n\nIf a user account previously and legitimately used PsExec, that now brings into doubt the validity of assumption that THIS particular PsExec activity was the threat actor and was malicious. All we can conclude from the registry data is that PsExec has been on disk and associated with the JEyre account.\n\nBackground Activity Moderator (BAM)\n\nBackground Activity Moderator is an interesting source of telemetry, seemingly available from Windows 10 onwards.\n\nI’ve heard claims BAM can ONLY be found on Win10 machines, but this is definitely not true—the data below has all been pulled from a Windows Server (Server 2022, Version 2009 Build 20348). However, I cannot claim to have any semblance of knowledge on exactly which OS, builds and versions BAM is and is not present for. 🤷\n\nBAM is useful for illuminating the full path of an executed program, the time it was executed and the SID / user account associated with this execution. This offers us a layer of evidence different from that of the EULA Accept, which could tell us PsExec once existed under JEyre but couldn’t offer a time.\n\nTo query BAM, you’ve got two options:\n\nThe first is to simply manually look at the registry data. This can be messy and does not convert SIDs for you, but boy ain’t it nice to get your hands dirty sometimes?\n\nThe second is to leverage Matthew Green’s Get-BAMParser.ps1 PowerShell script, which includes a nicer format and converts SIDs to user accounts. I made a change request on this script so it would work with Server 2022.\n\nIf manual: you don’t need a fancy script! Just good eyes. What we lose here, however, are timestamps.\n\nAnd if you use the script, be ready to ZOOM in. We get timestamps via the PowerShell script, which is a huge and necessary layer of evidence.\n\nAnalyzing BAM’s data on PsExec gives us the user account JEyre with the full path of execution. This is useful, as it corroborates what the EULA registry data stated about JEyre, and now we have specific directories that we can go and investigate to see if the threat actor dropped any other tools. Moreover, BAM offers a wider context of some activities that occurred, and we can start to contextualise what the threat actor did while they were in our environment.\n\nA limitation of BAM is that it trusts the executable name. If we rename it NotPsExec.exe that is how BAM will record it and report it back to us after parsing. Unlike checking the EULA registry data, which confirms PsExec was run and accepted, BAM goes off the sincerity of the executable name. Moreover, BAM offers little clarification on the frequency of execution. Is this the first time, or last time, or any time that the threat actor used JEyre’s account to PsExec?\n\nWe have a much clearer picture than when we started. But now we need to start gathering actionable information for our reader.\n\nPrefetch\n\nI’ve spoken about prefetch before. It is automatically disabled on Windows Servers, but can be enabled with ease. If you’re unable to leverage prefetch to triangulate, might I suggest Amcache and Shimcache instead.\n\nYou can gain some early insight by looking in the prefetch directory on the host. Things executed will have a .PF file, but just looking at this directory alone is useful.\n\nYou can pick up a .PF file and parse it using Eric Zimmerman’s PECmd tool:\n\nBy leveraging prefetch, we gain something quite interesting that we did not have before: precise frequency of execution. We are told that an executable called PsExec.exe ran six times, and the run times are put precisely. Moreover, from prefetch, we do not get a user account confirmed, but we do get insight on the directories referenced when PsExec was evoked.\n\nI say an executable called PsExec.exe, because prefetch is not able to qualify the executable name. Like BAM, it trusts the executable name and bases the recording of data from that name. So if this was renamed NotPsExec.exe, that is what we would see.\n\nHowever, name manipulation does not make prefetch data useless. We can continue to triangulate our findings by pivoting over to the target machine. In the target’s prefetch directory, we can find record of PsExeSVC.exe: the reciprocating agent to PsExec.\n\nBy parsing PsExeSVC’s prefetch file, we get a more certain timestamp. This assumes the threat actor did not change the service name (as we have noted), but we can see a far much specific time that grounds our above six PsExec times from prefetch.\n\nAnd going full circle in our triangulation, we actually already saw this timestamp when we looked at EventID 7045’s in the System log of the target machine. Thus, we have near factual conclusions about the time of activity.\n\nA limitation of prefetch is that it first has to be present on the host, and second that it lacks the ability to attribute user accounts and is too trusting of the sincerity of executable names. But these flaws are addressed by the information in other telemetry we have leveraged, and moreover, we now have a better window of time that we can offer our reader for malicious activity.\n\nLayers of Evidence\n\nLike layers of Swiss cheese, the different sources of telemetry individually have gaps—but combined, they make a more cohesive block; a more definitive, credible story is told once we amass and triangulate our data.\n\nOur report about the lateral movement has been nuanced by our triangulation. We were able to confirm the lateral movement was indeed Psexec via the 7045s in the System log, the data in the EULA and in BAM in the registry, as well as prefetch that added greater nuance about frequency and path location.\n\nBy triangulating these different sources of telemetry, and using each of their strengths to compensate their weaknesses, we gathered incredibly specific data that our readers can take action on. We corroborated the user account associated with PsExec (JEyre), we established the directories involved (C:\\Users\\JEyre\\Downloads\\PsTools), and established a window of time with (April 2022 April 4th 02:32 - 03:17 UTC).\n\nI hope I’ve successfully conveyed that triangulation is a worthy concept to stay conscious of during an investigation. Chances are you’re doing it already, and now you know a fancy word for it.\n\nThe point of triangulation isn’t to prove the same things ten times over. The point of triangulation is to know the limitations of an individual digital forensic component, and to assemble a number of these artefacts to compensate and bring with them unique findings that add nuance to the phenomena we are investigating.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nWe all know that the executive summary on page one will be where most readers begin and end. We might want people to read our reports in their entirety. But we also want our readers to trust us—to trust our recommendations and findings from page one onwards.\n\nThrough triangulation, we can offer reports that are laden with actionable information for a reader to run with—and the confidence that we, the investigators, have reported as close to fact as possible.\n\nWe don’t have to write verbosely to communicate our findings; it’s about specific language and certain phrases that demonstrate you are an investigator speaking with evidence-ordained authority on this matter. Maybe at some point, I’ll write about some of the particular vernacular I adopt when I’m writing up reports (stay tuned). At any rate, I hope you enjoyed reading about triangulation, and I hope it saves your behind when you next have to report to a technical senior or executive.\n\nA major limitation of triangulation is that it requires the investigator to know and have access to multiple data sources that can all speak to a phenomenon they are studying. I don’t have a good answer for this one I am afraid—you’ll just have to check out some of the material in the DFIR community and start leveling yourself! Or you can just keep following my articles on our Huntress blog. 😉 Why not both!?",

These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country, and in some cases, may not be as protective. Specifically, our servers, service providers, and subprocessors are primarily located in the United States, and we may process your information in jurisdictions where our affiliates/partners and service providers, or subprocessors, are located. See our Subprocessor List, available at www.huntress.com/legal, for more details. However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Data will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These safeguards include ensuring we have data protection agreements between us and our service providers and subprocessors to whom we transfer the Personal Data, which require these companies to protect Personal Data they process from the European Economic Area (“EEA”), United Kingdom (“UK”), or Switzerland in accordance with applicable data protection law. Huntress offers a Data Processing Addendum, available at www.huntress.com/legal, with European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses, to meet the adequacy and security requirements for our customers located in or that operate in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, and other international transfers of Personal Data with similar privacy regulations.\n\nKeeping Your Personal Data Secure\n\nWe have appropriate security measures in place to prevent Personal Data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way. We limit access to your Personal Data to those who have a genuine business need to access it. Those processing your Personal Data will do so only in an authorized manner and are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach where we are legally required to do so.\n\nHuntress is committed to protecting the security of the information it collects and processes. The information is stored on computer servers with limited and controlled access. Huntress operates secure data networks protected by industry-standard firewall and password protection systems. Huntress uses a wide range of security technologies and procedures to protect information from threats such as unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we collect or process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. Following the end of the relevant retention period, we will delete or anonymise your Personal Data.\n\nYour Rights\n\nYou have the following rights, which you can exercise free of charge:\n\nAccess.

The CCPA defines “sell” broadly to include disclosing or making available personal information to a third party in order to receive certain benefits or services from them. While we do not “sell” personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary compensation, we may make personal information available, which may be defined as a sale by the CCPA; this is common practice among companies that operate online, such as sharing with third party advertisers for purposes of targeting advertisements on Huntress and non-Huntress websites, applications, and services. As defined by the CCPA, we may “sell” usage details and identifiers to third party advertising networks, social networks, co-sponsors of marketing events, and data analytics providers. In addition, we may allow third parties to collect personal information from our sites or services if those third parties are authorized service providers who have agreed to our contractual limitations as to their retention, use, and disclosure of such personal information, or if you use our sites or services to interact with third parties or direct us to disclose your personal information to third parties.

We will verify your request using the information associated with your account, including email address. Government identification may be required. Consumers can also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on their behalf. Authorized agents must submit proof of authorization.\n\nChanges to This Privacy Policy\n\nThis Policy may change from time to time and your continued use of the Websites and Services is deemed to be acceptance of such changes.

So what exactly do they do? I even sat down for a sales call and I'll be honest I still don't get it.\n\nI know they are universally loved pretty much, and I want to deploy them and have them as a partner!\n\n## Comment ID hybrw74 with +53 score by [(andrew-huntress, Reddit, 2022-02-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/t0msza/what_exactly_is_huntress/hybrw74/) (in reply to ID t0msza):\nThanks for tagging me /u/Quadling - I saw this thread earlier and was surprised to see how much attention it got. I typically prefer to let the community run with discussions like this but am happy to share my thoughts when asked!\n\nAs many correctly stated, the core of the Huntress service had always been footholds, or persistence. /u/computerguy0-0 did a great job in explaining how our service fit into the \"detect\" category of the NIST framework. [We played here exclusively for quite some time](https://i.imgur.com/VeW6WFK.png) and built our reputation by being the absolute best at detect and respond. \n\nIn [the last 24 months](https://i.imgur.com/tCfq9x5.png), we've added [Assisted Remediation](https://support.huntress.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404005119251-Understanding-Huntress-Incidents#Remediation), [Ransomware Canaries](https://support.huntress.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404005090067-Ransomware-Canaries), [External Recon](https://support.huntress.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404012768147-External-Recon), [Managed Windows Defender](https://support.huntress.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404005212691-Managed-Microsoft-Defender-Antivirus-Overview), [Host Isolation](https://support.huntress.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404960349459-Host-Isolation-Beta-) and have expanded our team globally to provide true 24/7 threat hunting.\n\nIn May of 2021, [we raised $40 million](https://www.huntress.com/blog/huntress-series-b-our-next-chapter-of-growth) in **minority VC investment** (no PE shenanigans here) with the intent of [going beyond detect and respond](https://i.imgur.com/ZDq8AYk.png). \n\nWe [acquired a company and their EDR technology](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/kvui00/huntress_acquires_networkaware_edr_technology/) around the same time and spent the last year rebuilding this from *the ground up* getting ready to introduce this functionality to our partners. This EDR functionality release was a [hot topic a few weeks ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/sjhld7/huntress_managed_av/) and for those of you who don't want to check out that thread, it will begin rolling out to partners starting on 4/1. \n\nWe have a ton more on the roadmap both for the rest of 2022 and 2023 and I believe we'll be doing a townhall style webinar in mid April to share those plans with the world. Hope this helps!\n\n### Comment ID hydxei5 with +3 score by [(AccidentalMSP, Reddit, 2022-02-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/t0msza/what_exactly_is_huntress/hydxei5/) (in reply to ID hybrw74):\nThis is the first I'm hearing of the EDR. I think it's great news and I hope that it elevates you from the awkward  in between stage where your neither AV, nor EDR, nor SOC. Post compromise persistence detection, as you must know, is no longer competitive against the EDR/MDR/SOC players, regardless of how good.\n\nI'd encourage you to change the launch date.

Large then-unmanaged client hit with ransomware. Combined with switching AV away from Webroot (which did almost nothing against it), Huntress allowed me to not only get ahead of it, but prevent remnants (the 'footholds' Huntress looks for) from activating and continuing to spread.\n\n## Comment ID hybjj5p with +22 score by [(Imburr, Reddit, 2022-02-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/t0msza/what_exactly_is_huntress/hybjj5p/) (in reply to ID t0msza):\nIn addition to all of the other things said in this thread, Huntress has been instrumental in the MSP community in raising awareness about security. They have partnered with MSP's, and they seem genuinely interested in helping MSP's and their clients be more secure. Usually during a zero-day, or large scale breach, you will find Kyle/Huntress leading the charge with forensics, information, and remediation.\n\nWe had a ransomware event a few years ago at a client and Huntress was on the phone with us, coaching and giving good advice, from square one. I think had it not been for them the outcome would have been much different.\n\nAttend a Tradecraft Tuesday webinar with these guys, its fascinating.\n\n## Comment ID hyaykiy with +16 score by [(d3cay, Reddit, 2022-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/t0msza/what_exactly_is_huntress/hyaykiy/) (in reply to ID t0msza):\nSo they mostly look for what they call footholds.  Usually services, scheduled tasks or other junk usually left behind after malware is cleaned up or before malware is deployed during a breach.  They provide a nice actionable report on what they find, the report has detailed actions for remediation.  They also provide a button to allow the agent to remediate for you.  \n\nWe use it along side Sentinel One, it has been great.\n\n### Comment ID hyb5o04 with +10 score by [(wheres_my_2_dollars, Reddit, 2022-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/t0msza/what_exactly_is_huntress/hyb5o04/) (in reply to ID hyaykiy):\nWhat has been great?

It finds all kinds of things left behind from malware that has been cleaned up in the past. Even in environments that have both Huntress will find a few things S1 doesn't.  Good example is the recent issues with exchange, Huntress would detect the shell files where S1 didn't.\n\n### Comment ID hyazcoj with +2 score by [(admin_mac, Reddit, 2022-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/t0msza/what_exactly_is_huntress/hyazcoj/) (in reply to ID hyaykiy):\nWe do too.

Threatlocker is application whitelisting. It fits in with \"Protect\".  \n  \nHuntress fits in with \"Detect\".  \n  \nhttps://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/five-functions  \n  \nHuntress is there to see someone gaining permanent access, \"a foothold\", to a computer. There are only so many ways to establish a foothold and Huntress covers all of them on a Windows OS. This is backed by the human element.  \n  \nThe appeal of the product is quick identification. You want to catch the bad guys getting in as soon as possible so you can stop them as early as possible to minimize damage.  \n  \nYES, other products such as S1 do detect persistence, Huntress cleans up a lot of the noise that other products typically make to only actionable events, again, sometimes reviewed by a human in a timely manor. Plus, for big events, Huntress actually gives a damn and calls their partners.  \n  \nI heard from TWO companies during the Kaseya breach, Huntress and Blackpoint. I wasn't even a partner at Huntress yet. I am now a partner of both and deploy both to various customers at my MSP. It's well worth having them on my side when something inevitably goes wrong.",

Huntress doesn't really have visibility beyond endpoints today. This limited scope does create some blind spots and potential risks.  \n\n\nThey also don't really offer the ability to choose the vendor of your choice.

A very unique and important one.\n\nFor context, we run three EDR platforms on our managed endpoints. About a year ago we hired a penetration testing firm and had them run an assumed breach scenario to test our endpoint security. They had physical access to the machine and a user login. Halfway through the test period, we upgraded this to local admin account.\n\nWindows Defender is turned on with Defender for Endpoint P1 via M365 Business Premium license. For this test it was out of the box configuration on Microsoft's end, running recommended settings from Huntress. This was the first layer of defense and did well in blocking initial access attempts. Huntress caught and recorded, but did not alert on, the blocked attempts (this is intentional, thier systems are tuned to alert on active, live threats not blocked ones).\n\nTodyl EDR (custom, highly tuned Elastic/Endgame engine) kicked in as the second layer. Thier SOC alerted to the threatening activity and isolated the endpoint within 10 minutes. As a result of this testing, they now pull in and analyze alerts from Defender as well. \n\nHuntress is the backstop. The supporting and most important layer, in my opinion. Thier systems and SOC detect, alert and action on threats that have bypasses every other platform. Because they use whitelist-based methodology for persistent activity, they will catch those sneaky, manual attacks that slip by everyone else. For us, when Huntress alerts, it's an immediate all hands on deck, red alert, defcon 1 scenario. It means something is active on the system and has bypassed the blocking layers.\n\nHuntress can absolutely run standalone on a system alongside Defender and do a phenomenal job. They will catch all the bad things. That said, they are also not a full SOC/SIEM solution. If detailed or customized alerting is important, you should have additional defensive layers in place. This could be SentinelOne, Todyl, Crowdstrike, etc.\n\nThis doesn't even begin to touch the Huntress contributions to this community. They are always on top of the latest threats and actively hunting them across every endpoint. If something big is going down, your first notification will be from Huntress. They are the only security vendor who is willing to take intelligent, proactive action to protect thier clients. Such as deploying files or registry keys that block widespread attacks, as they did in the Kaseya breach.\n\nIf I was limited to a single security vendor, Huntress would be my choice.\n\n### Comment ID jz919p2 with +10 score by [(matt0_0, Reddit, 2023-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/16ahw3s/whats_the_point_of_huntress/jz919p2/) (in reply to ID jz86jeq):\nI acknowledge this is pretty nitpicky... but as far as I'm aware, this chart is still accurate\n\nhttps://tminus365.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pic2.png\n\nSuch that P1 (comes with M365 E3) is significantly less featured than Defender for Endpoint Business edition (comes with Business Premium).

We have a number of clients that use both. When we address ransomware, we will sometimes ask the MSP to contact Huntress for a trial while we deploy SentinelOne Complete with DV and Vigilance SOC to see if Huntress can find fragments SentinelOne might not find, or the opposite.\n\nHaving two SOCs can certainly be a challenge when addressing incidents or operating day to day.\n\nIt's also pertinent to remember Vigilance SOC is a remediation SOC meaning they address the issues they discover. With their new release of Spotlight threat hunting, they've made the process far, far easier and my SOC guys certainly love it. There are some alternatives that work quite well. In the 5 years, and 30k endpoints we get from SentinelOne, all with the Vigilance SOC, we've not wanted for anything more. Perhaps a more integrated and affordable platform, which we are moving to. Even in complex ransomware incidents where we've deployed it, and other platforms, for remediation it's performed quite well.\n\nSo to summarize, You can operate with one or the other without missing too much. If you're dealing with a ransomware incident, then perhaps engaging both and a remediation team would make sense.\n\nIf you're looking for unbiased info on platforms, check out the Mitre Enginuity Caranabak/FIN7 Wizard Sandstorm ransomware tests where they provide the results and each sub-section findings in the open for all to see.\n\nIf you don't already attend the Huntress Tradefraft Tuesday webinars, I highly recommend them.\n\nIf you're looking for more 'all in one' options, take a look at Blackpoint Cyber as one alternative. There are a few 'all in one' solutions newly introduced to the channel that simplify providing cybersecurity to the end-client. Blackpoint is one. In our recent testing of Blackpoint, it did an impressively good job against the ransomware VMs we got from CISA and from other sources. Their Office365 security is also impressive.\n\n### Comment ID jz80gvd with +2 score by [(icedcougar, Reddit, 2023-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/16ahw3s/whats_the_point_of_huntress/jz80gvd/) (in reply to ID jz7gsnz):\nFew questions,\n\nSpotlight - is this for huntress or s1, as I’ve never heard of it unless you mean skylight (XDR)\n\nVigilance - when you say this do you mean vigilance or vigilance PRO\n\nIf you’ve used both vigilance and vigilance pro… what’s the real difference?\n\n(I use s1 complete, DV, skylight, vigilance, watchtower)\n\n#### Comment ID jz8g0nq with +2 score by [(FutureSafeMSSP, Reddit, 2023-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/16ahw3s/whats_the_point_of_huntress/jz8g0nq/) (in reply to ID jz80gvd):\nI meant Skylight.

We have Huntress set to install as soon as a machine updates Group Policy so even though we had no idea this machine had been added, Huntress stopped the most dangerous Ransomware out there on its own: isolated machine, stopped running process and then remediated the issue for us (we still nuked & paved the machine).\n\nBuy it.

Since deploying, they have found a few minor incidents that required remediation and in each case provided a good explanation for what happened as well as steps to correct the issue.  The automated remediation is awesome but if you want to do things manually they provide steps to do that.\n\nMost recently, they were front and center working on the 3CX breach.  I had some machines with the vulnerable application installed.  I was notified of each impacted machine before any damage was done and I was able to quickly respond with removal scripts to eliminate the vulnerable software.  On top of that, my account rep reached out to me to make sure I was aware of the 3CX incident.\n\nOn the business side they have been great to deal with.  A few months ago my account rep reached out to me to offer a different tier, not advertised on the website, that was able to save me money.  After finding out that they can now bill in Canadian currency she worked diligently to revise my agreement which is also saving me money and making my costs predictable.\n\nPrior to using Huntress I was running S1, and it's a great product.  I have since fully migrated to Huntress with managed Defender and have had no regrets.  Knowing there is a competent team behind me helps me sleep at night.  I'm a small, one man MSP with around 200 endpoints but I've always felt like I'm just as important to them as any large customer.  Can't speak highly enough of them.\n\n### Comment ID jf3u3xj with +10 score by [(Abandoned_Brain, Reddit, 2023-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/12cunua/huntress_worth_the_money/jf3u3xj/) (in reply to ID jf3p9t3):\nOh, and don't forget they were all over the Veeam VBR vulnerability!

I feel really comfortable with both S1 and Huntress on machines.  I understand there is an additional cost with these though.\n\nAnother major thing to consider, like others have mentioned, is the incredible resource Huntress is for the entire community.  They do regular webinars with engineers which are a great resource to get on the pulse of what they are seeing.  And the response to pretty much every major incident over the last few years has been spearheaded by Huntress with real world data, expert advice, and remediations (which sometimes will be pushed automatically by them).

Nothing dangerous but still stuff S1, a leading EDR, completely missed.\n\nIt's amazingly quiet because they do all the work for you. Support is amazing. They treat you like a real partner that matters to them. They are stupid fast to resolve any issue and willing to answer any question. And the list goes on and on.\n\nI don't see why any MSP would not partner with them.\n\n## Comment ID jf3ri5a with +8 score by [(gizmodious, Reddit, 2023-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/12cunua/huntress_worth_the_money/jf3ri5a/) (in reply to ID 12cunua):\nIncredible product at an accessible price. 100% worth it.\n\n## Comment ID jf3sysn with +8 score by [(SecOpsWarrior, Reddit, 2023-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/12cunua/huntress_worth_the_money/jf3sysn/) (in reply to ID 12cunua):\nOne of the best endpoint vendors out there for MSPs. I'm a consultant who builds and scales security programs for Managed Service Providers, and I have yet to come across an engagement where I haven't recommended it to my clients, even as a \"safety net\" for another current in-house endpoint management tool.\n\nIt's also great as a tool for second and third shift alerting so you don't have to staff those until you're ready. Set up rewst, opsgenie, pagerduty, or whatever you're using so that when a huntress alert high or critical comes in, you start blowing up the call tree until someone picks up.\n\n### Comment ID jf4ocbl with +4 score by [(JohnSnyderNFI, Reddit, 2023-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/12cunua/huntress_worth_the_money/jf4ocbl/) (in reply to ID jf3sysn):\nJesse, you're everywhere!

You will not find a product that can perform how Huntress performs at anywhere near the price. In addition to its standalone capabilities, the ability to manage Defender is the cherry on top.  Easy deployment and ticketing integration makes it very set and forget.\n\nAlso included is External Recon. It uses Shodan to port scan every public IP an agent beacons from. This was an easy way for me to audit our clients to ensure that only required ports are exposed.\n\nMy only caveats..\n\nYou have to remember to manually map any new clients to the corresponding client in PSA.\n\nSeems easy to defeat (no anti-tamper) but no one is targeting it. By the time I ran a NLTEST and pinged a DC from a Huntress protected box, Huntress fired a ticket into PSA.\n\nIt provides a nice indicator of what machines Defender agents are borked on but fixing these is time-consuming---but this is more of a Defender issue.\n\nAs a co-managed SOC platform, Huntress' only action is host-isolate.. but in those critical instances.. it totally works. Ticket fires into PSA and you are getting a phone call from a Huntress engineer stepping you through what actions to take. \n\nAgain there are other more expensive SOC platforms out there that can take more actions but if you are doing a standard offering for your clients and an elevated security offering, Huntress fits right into that price/performance bracket for a standard offering.\n\n### Comment ID kpidiw1 with +2 score by [(hirs0009, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/12cunua/huntress_worth_the_money/kpidiw1/) (in reply to ID jf8wuqo):\nI just sat through a sale presentation and honestly it looks like the product is kind of a half measure with many holes.

What is everyone else's thoughts?\n\n[https://feedback.huntress.com/changelog](https://feedback.huntress.com/changelog)  \n\n\nEdit: A few examples of things that I feel should have been discovered earlier:  \n\n\n1. *\"We found that when we were importing existing inbox rules for M365 users during Huntress onboarding, we were not generating alerts for our SOC analysts to report. It turns out that we had a bug that caused the events not to match the detectors, so we were not able to report on malicious inbox rules that existed before we were deployed and started to receive the Microsoft 365 events from the audit log.\"*\n2. \"*We found that in some cases, we were missing detections because the maximum number of hits an Elasticsearch rule was able to have was 100. This meant that if there were too many matches in a short time period, not all matches would be returned. This one was not obvious, because you don't know what you don't know, but we identified some events that we thought should have generated signals and did not and we've seen this issue with Elasticsearch before.\"*\n3. **Feel like these should have been baked in already.** *\"I don't know how helpful listing the new detectors we're adding will be, but we've gotten a decent number of requests from folks to help them understand what types of things we're detecting, so here are a few new detectors we shipped:*\r  \n*Login from VPN*\r  \n*Login from proxy*\r  \n*Login from brute force IP*\r  \n*Login from TOR*\r  \n*Login from new region*\r  \n*Login from RDP\"*\n\n## Comment ID kd2kjmo with +32 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd2kjmo/) (in reply to ID 18gptkf):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID kd48s68 with +7 score by [(glibbertarian, Reddit, 2023-12-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd48s68/) (in reply to ID kd2kjmo):\nThey have VC money that needs to see a return.\n\n#### Comment ID kd4zqbc with +3 score by [(cablemps, Reddit, 2023-12-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd4zqbc/) (in reply to ID kd48s68):\nReally?

I said then and say now: Build great tech and let the market be the judge. \n\nRegarding the 365 MDR product, we decided to give it a try, but unfortunately, the product is just not ready yet. My concern is that this distraction could potentially harm what's been working well (Managed EDR). We're not seeing much innovation in that area: no firewall ingestion , no automated response capabilities beyond Microsoft Defender, etc. Is anyone feeling the same?\n\n### Comment ID kd553xc with +6 score by [(marqo09, Reddit, 2023-12-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd553xc/) (in reply to ID kd2kjmo):\nI don’t understand the negativity.\n\nWe’ve discovered and reported over 1,000 M365 incidents prior to the mentioned updates to the community we love and pour everything into.\n\nIMHO, Reid Hoffman nailed it when he said, “If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late.”\n\nAnother common product philosophy is “Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good.”\n\nAt Huntress, we ship and iterate until hackers are forced to change their tradecraft/go elsewhere. That means early versions of our products will have short-lived quirks and is why we always accompany them with early adopter pricing during this time—for being an early adopter.\n\nFor those not tracking, this is the same product philosophy that allowed us to stay agile and on top of every major SMB/MSP outbreak from 2015-Present. It’s key to staying ahead of threat actors [tight feedback loops](https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=698&v=AQfbPpkaq88&feature=youtu.be) and delaying for perfection is a dangerous precedent.\n\nKyle\n\n#### Comment ID kd6d6l3 with +5 score by [(BornConcentrate5571, Reddit, 2023-12-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd6d6l3/) (in reply to ID kd553xc):\nI agree.\n\nThe Huntress product suite is good.

I have an email from my account manager from last week telling me I can save some moolah by moving up a tier. Same account manager gave me a mid-tier discount without me even asking for one - called me up, said “thanks for being a customer” and offered.\n\nHuntress’s MDR for M365 costs SFA compared to alternatives. Like all products it’s gonna have bugs, even out of beta. It’s also gonna get better as a product because beta feedback is 99% “quash this bug” and “where’s the doco?”, real user feedback starts at real use, and if I know anything about Huntress and I think I do, they’re gonna load features into this thing that will make you cry from happiness.\n\n## Comment ID kd28a8i with +6 score by [(jackmusick, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd28a8i/) (in reply to ID 18gptkf):\nIt sounds like from #3, that means it considers impossible travel now, right?\n\n### Comment ID kd2g6m0 with +9 score by [(chrisbisnett, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd2g6m0/) (in reply to ID kd28a8i):\nWe are looking at the locations and trying to determine impossible travel. We're doing it in a way that we think will be more effective and accurate rather than the naive way, which is to compare the time between two login events and the distance between the two locations to determine an average velocity and then estimate a reasonable threshold. We also have this capability, but early versions of it generated too many false positives so we disabled it. Our R&D team has been working on a new version that appears to have fewer false positives.\n\nI'll never say it's perfect or that we're going to detect impossible travel with 100% certainty, but we are evaluating these things and detecting malicious activity with what we have.\n\n#### Comment ID kd2t3xn with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd2t3xn/) (in reply to ID kd2g6m0):\nWhy are you building your own alert vs leveraging Microsoft built in Impossible Travel alert?\n\nafaik their system takes more into account then just velocity between locations using things like, browser version, time of day, resources accessed, machine ID, OS version etc to determine that you are you and that the machine you are using is reasonable for you to access and the fact that you are using a VPN to change your location or using a VM in Azure/AWS won't trigger their alert?\n\n### Comment ID kd2llw4 with +1 score by [(toabear, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd2llw4/) (in reply to ID kd28a8i):\nOne of my users got a VPN hit.

The fact that we were only seeing the first 100 matches for a detector wasn't obvious and didn't trigger until we started to bring on more partners to where we would have that many hits. We would have had a better chance of detecting this if we had built in more observability from the beginning, but it's always a tradeoff. Spending a lot of time on observability and ignoring features and onboarding customers doesn't get you much. It's about balancing the two. We're spending more time on observability stuff now to make sure we can identify any regressions in the future.\n\nWe would have liked to have some of these baked in from the beginning, but for most of these to work we had to build in the additional context and ingest data from third-party sources where they are the experts. To know if a user is logging in from a new location requires you to store and query all of the prior locations for the user, which we had to build out. Unlike other services, we didn't want our partners to have to go in and specify which countries or regions were allowed for thousands of M365 users. That's untenable. Other vendor solutions have hard-coded rules for things like M365 users outside of the U.S., which is also not going to work for a lot of folks. It took a bit of time to build these.\n\n### Comment ID kd2mozj with +4 score by [(evilmuffin99, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd2mozj/) (in reply to ID kd2fb4n):\nSome of that does make sense.

Usually this comes in the form of detections. If we feel that it can detect malicious activity, we want to get it in peoples hands so they can start using it and we can capture more data and with more data we can improve the detection capabilities.\n\nIn this case we were detecting things and sending incident reports and customers were largely happy. In cases where we had missed things during the beta we had adjusted and felt that we were now detecting those things. What surprised us was when we opened it up to general availability and started on-boarding more partners we found that with a larger sample size we had more things that we missed and we didn't iterate as fast as we should have on those to close those gaps.\n\nSo we felt like releasing this was going to help our partners find malicious activity within their M365 tenants, and that's why we moved forward with it.\n\n#### Comment ID kd4bqmt with +2 score by [(mpethe, Reddit, 2023-12-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18gptkf/huntress_has_made_some_mdr365_updates/kd4bqmt/) (in reply to ID kd2mozj):\nI was definitely given the impression when I demo'd it that it was going to detect impossible travel type logins.

Huntress isn't intended to find everything. In fact, if you're super lucky, they might not find anything for a year. But when a persistent foothold does get installed in your systems, that means it has already made it past all other preventative measures that you have in place. From that point onward, it's only a matter of time before the attacker works their way down to you in their queue of \"ready to exploit\" organizations where they have footholds and then begins stealing credentials, lateral movement, AD info exfil, then payload drop.   \nThe Huntress team makes the incidents that you resolve with the Huntress product feel like nothing because it's so easy, but each high or critical they send could have turned into a business-altering breach without Huntress as an extension of your team.  \n\n\nI'm not there any longer, I don't have a dog in that fight, but compared to a lot of the other security vendors that try to solve security problems with software alone and sell you by making outlandish claims, \"The End Of Cyber Crime\" etc., Huntress actually provides value in their partnership, and in their solution.

The client agreed. \n\nHuntress had only a few minutes after being installed to start working. It alerted. \n\nAfterwards, doing forensics, we found out Huntress had correctly identified the malware in the few minutes it had before the machine was powered off.

We were looking for evidence of threat actors accessing potential unencrypted credentials and stumbled across the security risk.\n\nOne important distinction - we didn’t scan or download any of these files. We monitor process events via our EDR and saw that a file that looked like a password-containing file was accessed by a user. We didn’t use anything special, purely just looking at files being accessed with password in the name.\n\nEdit 2: We appreciate the feedback!

They also have the ability to ingest logs from hardware devices such as computers and firewalls.  Their installed agent can also act as a honeypot.   I think there might be a bit of overlap, but really depends on what you got Blumira for.",

The only one customers comment positively about the training is Huntress/Curricula - which I thought was interesting since the training runs longer than the others we used in the past, but it is more engaging. It's fast to setup, easy to manage and the training content is good - great. My $.02 is that they are more focused on the ease of initial customer setup, automating campaign management, and new user intro's, etc. I really like the ability to add your own content and have it wrapped up in the LMS like the included content. If Huntress is reading this, please consider adding HIPAA and OSHA content.\n\nFor a MSP already using huntress, I've seen no compelling reason not to use their SAT and keep your vendor count down.\n\n### Comment ID kg510mf with +6 score by [(Nate379, Reddit, 2024-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18xkntl/huntress_security_awareness_training/kg510mf/) (in reply to ID kg4vrp3):\nReally...

What \"sold\" me was the customers we trialed early on actually commented their liking of the content, which has never occurred previously with other SAT platforms. As long as people engage with the training, that's what matters to the customers. My opinion of the content isn't that important, as long as the content hits on the most common subjects. I think slick content might be what sells MSP's on a platform. IMO, the rapid deployment, ease of managing campaigns, adding users, rolling your own content into the process seamlessly, new employee onboarding content, basically reducing the level of effort to deliver training and phish testing and keep score is what I look for - pair that with good content for the win.\n\n#### Comment ID kg7m8al with +3 score by [(connor-phin, Reddit, 2024-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/18xkntl/huntress_security_awareness_training/kg7m8al/) (in reply to ID kg510mf):\nIn fairness to huntress (and every other SAT I’ve ever heard of).

I was thoroughly unimpressed with how unprofessional this person was. While nice enough, they didn't bother to ask me almost anything or engage in virtually any of the consultative selling dialogue we expect from vendors these days.\n\nHas anyone had similar experiences with Huntress' initial touch points? Are there just a bunch of Huntress shills on this board, or am I missing something? Considering how unimpressed I were with BOTH of the initial touches, I am not inclined to proceed with them, but I don't want to miss out if they truly have a stellar platform AND if they have good post-sales support.\n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: please see below for a very positive update!\n\n## Comment ID jbq8c0o with +36 score by [(OIT_Ray, Reddit, 2023-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbq8c0o/) (in reply to ID 11o1h1t):\nI'm not trying to minimalize your experience.

We use a round robin model vs a territory model, meaning when you ask to speak with the team the first thing we need to figure out is which team you would be working with. Off the top of my head, I believe the lines we draw are 0-49 endpoints, 50 - 749 endpoints, 750 - 1,999 endpoints, and 2,000+ endpoints. Once they identify which bucket you fall into, they would schedule a meeting with a rep and a sales engineer. \n\nI'll let others speak to their experience working with our team (both pre and post sales) but I'm super bummed to hear you didn't have a good first experience.

We had a new customer during the trial that had remnants of ransomware that it removed.\n\n\\- Can remove AV costs (not Sentinel One or Crowdstrike).  If you are paying for another AV and think Defender is a reasonable AV it is a viable option.\n\n\\- No constant / useless alerts.\n\n\\- Very little babysitting is required.  This solution requires very little tech time.\n\n\\- Emailed reports for agents that haven't checked in and other things that let you know the solution is still in.\n\n\\- Very straightforward pricing and contracts.  Really, this is what we want all vendors to do but few actually do.\n\n\\- They legitimately are out there helping MSPs enhance their security (neighborhood watch is a great example of this).  It isn't the disingenuous \"help\" where they say \"we want to help you grow\" crap we hear from every other vendor as they try to convince us their product will add revenue with no / little work!\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- Integration with RMMs is still a little light.\n\n\\- Like all security software, you want it to do something to justify the cost in your head but also don't want the security event.  It helps if it is also the AV replacement.\n\n\\- They don't play \"let's make a deal\".  Now this is in direct conflict with the pros, but it is something I am used to.  I rake ever vendor over the coals to get the best possible pricing / deal.  It was almost offensive that they wouldn't make any concessions!  Messed up I know because I don't want my customers trying it with me...  What can I say?  I am the product of a predatory vendor channel!!!\n\n\\- That last price increase was painful and borderline crazy.  It moved the product from a no-brainer to something you have to ensure there was no duplication for (replace lower AVs and such).  I have been told that their price increases are rare, but it was still a hell of a jump.  While they announced it all at the same time, it was still 25% in 2022 and 20% for this year.  (Quick note here - this isn't to say that the price increase isn't warranted.  They have crazy good support and security analysts.  Anytime prices go up that much though, it is still a \"Con\")\n\n## Comment ID jbrup0s with +9 score by [(wireditfellow, Reddit, 2023-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbrup0s/) (in reply to ID 11o1h1t):\nNice try Kaseya.\n\n## Comment ID jbrp0ke with +3 score by [(OnAKnowledgeQuest, Reddit, 2023-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbrp0ke/) (in reply to ID 11o1h1t):\nCurrent Huntress customer so take this with a grain of salt.

Depending on your settings they will isolate the host to prevent spread across other network devices. If a device is isolated they will call the contact number on the account. When an endpoint is isolated it can only communicate with Huntress. The email you receive contains detailed information on the incident and provides information regarding found foot holds and IOCs, it also provides detailed recommended remediation steps. What’s really handy is the automated approved remediation process, if you decide the recommended remediations are enough, you click a button and huntress does the rest, you even get to choose if you want to reboot the endpoint manually or let huntress reboot the machine. Huntress has stopped at least 3 ransomeware incidents from occurring on client machines that had other endpoint protection software (webroot(yuck)) was not alerted. You can also see from the dashboard processes that are actively being investigated by security analysts, and a ton of helpful details about what’s going on on endpoints. I guess the most important thing to remember when a incident occurs and huntress alerts you is trust but verify. Don’t always go with the automated remediations, if you do, manually go through the machine to check for other footholds or iocs. Nuke the machine if it’s serious. Let me know if you have other questions.\n\n#### Comment ID jbsmyu2 with +4 score by [(bazjoe, Reddit, 2023-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbsmyu2/) (in reply to ID jbrrmbl):\nCheap, good, fast -pick one … Huntress solidly gets all three done for proactive response.

We had an active brute force attack happening & figured it was a bigger issue as we were watching it happen on CONSOLE. \n\nSome of this comes down to expectations vs what was really going to happen. I believe the expectation from us was to just send an email and wait for a response. We thought since this is 'real people' looking at things then we could talk to someone. We ended up calling our sales rep who then called around and called back saying someone was looking into it. No more information could be provided. This entire time we are watching the brute force continue. This was about 15minutes into the 'attack' at this point and we just shut down the server while we waited on a response. It was roughly 15 minutes after that we got a response that everything looked good and there wasn't enough failed login attempts to warrant a flag.\n\nWe booted that server back up... and it continued. So who do you trust? Huntress or your console your actively watching be brute forced.\n\nSo the experience of an emergency defiantly did not leave us feeling good. However we do now have a better idea of what to expect. \n\nFor those of you still reading, wondering about the resolution? Well it turns out if you paste a notepad in a password field, even with restarting CW Control sessions multiple times, it will still just keep going. So it was technically both not a real hack attempt, and a legit brute force, regardless of the cause.\n\n### Comment ID jbqrync with +1 score by [(DevinSysAdmin, Reddit, 2023-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbqrync/) (in reply to ID jbqrc6o):\n🤦‍♂️\n\n#### Comment ID jbr6mwu with +1 score by [(enuro12, Reddit, 2023-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbr6mwu/) (in reply to ID jbqrync):\nA couple more of those and a couple pikachu emoji's and you've got the entire postmortem in a nut shell.\n\n### Comment ID jbqs0b4 with +1 score by [(andrew-huntress, Reddit, 2023-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/11o1h1t/huntress_sales_experience/jbqs0b4/) (in reply to ID jbqrc6o):\nIf you have any info on this (support ticket number, rough date on when it took place) I’d be interested in taking a look at this.

Well, not really, but if something could be worked out just to buy the licensing then maybe so I told her yes. She then copied me into an email with an MSP in Michigan while we're based in North Carolina. That Michigan person emailed me a link to his calendar to choose a time where he could then give me his pitch. No thanks.\n\nSo I emailed back the Huntress rep one more time and let her know we are adding an additional location in 2024 which should bring us up to about the 200 minimum and asked for more info, like pricing, etc. That was May 18 and I haven't heard a word back from her.\n\nMoving on to look at other solutions.

      "# Post ID 1atjpws: Blackpoint Cyber - Huntress with +36 score by [(cassini12, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/)\nHi,\n\n So quick note I have been a fan of Huntress for quite some time so this is not in anyway a rant. We just had an occurrence the other day and the way it was handled was not what I was expecting (probably my fault) or one that i cared for. Good news, nothing happened and we were working at 6am when the alert came thru so we disabled the M365 account in question and did our due diligence. Anyways,  \n\n So I am looking for some other MSPs advice on utilizing BlackPoint Cyber with Cloud Response as opposed to Huntress.  The example below is why I am looking for our firm and trying to decide if its the best solution for all of our clients. \n\n6:03am EST, Huntress alert via email regarding an M365 account the was logged into successfully from another country and also using an Express VPN client.  This firm in particular uses M365 accounts to access their companies data shares so this was a high potential for disaster.\n\n Account was not auto disabled , just this alert.  This alone did not sit well with me. In the overall scheme, if 3000 users are working fine and just 1 user gets locked out of their account as a security measure, then all is well in the world ... to just alert us via email simply reminded me exactly of the commercial on TV were a bank is being robbed and the security guard tells the customer \"Oh the bank is being robbed\" and the customer says \" Then stop them, do something\" in which he replies \" Oh no, I don't actually DO anything, I just tell you your being robbed\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n So fast forward to now and I see BP Cyber in Pax8, Read about it, demo it and it seems to be great BUT a demo means nothing when it comes to security I really just want to get some others input on utilizing BP with S1 over Huntress with S1and if you have done this how has the SOC been and do they seem very interactive?  I can say I love the random email alerts just letting us know about \"user X logged in from Y or User X changed a rule\" etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, I actually like Huntress a lot, they have some great communities and employees. I just need to know I can go to bed and if something happens at 3am I can deal with a locked account in the morning instead of a malware attack.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nthanks for your input!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Comment ID kqzfi1d with +28 score by [(giantsnyy1, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqzfi1d/) (in reply to ID 1atjpws):\nSo I actually had this happen to me with Blackpoint.

I'm the director of the SOC at Huntress. Feedback like this is helping us iterate aggressively on our approach and feature development. As of this past Friday, we are now using our new identity baselining technology to lay the ban hammer on certain M365 logins.\n\nWith this new tech, we consider accounts with at least 30 days of activity as \"***baselined***\". If we see a *baselined* account use a VPN provider for the first time, we send a ***Critical report, isolate the account, and kill the user sessions.***\n\nFor identities that don't yet have 30 days of data, we send a High report and do not isolate the account. This prevents a scenario where you deploy Huntress to an org using VPNs widely and  they all lose access to M365 until the MSP can respond.\n\nKeep in mind, should an attacker log into an un-baselined account from a VPN and trip any one of our additional detections for likely business email compromise/M365 attacker tradecraft, we'll immediately send a critical report and **isolate the account at that point.** We try to have multiple places in the attacker lifecycle to catch the attacker.  \n\\---  \nThings on our mind:\n\n* Consider reducing the baseline time from 30 days to 7 days.\n* Engage with partners to understand if they'd still prefer new identities to be isolated as well.\n\nHere is a [post from the other side of this debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1al67bw/huntress_new_m365_ip_detections_for_vpns_and/) earlier this month. It's a challenging balance but we're all in on creating innovative ways to solve it.\n\n**I can confidently say you have our ear** and we're having these exact conversations internally every week. We're iterating quickly based on real MSP feedback. If you're open to it, shoot me an email with your MSP name and I'll review this incident in depth to see if recent/upcoming changes would have modified the outcome here: [max.rogers@huntresslabs.com](mailto:max.rogers@huntresslabs.com)\n\n### Comment ID kqzmp1k with +11 score by [(RaNdomMSPPro, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqzmp1k/) (in reply to ID kqyhu20):\nThanks for weighing in. We’d like to see the option to just block any login activities from a vpn, per client would be ideal. I know you’re working towards more automated remediation vs. alert and the msp handles (problematic if you don’t staff 24x7) it’s generally ok to isolate and let us pickup the pieces, better than the alternative. Also, and I've suggested to huntress, incorporate the huntress agent presence as an extra trust check for customers using huntress edr too. Or integrate with common rmms for same effect to better evaluate things. Once you guys add some ms365 posture management capabilities (just buy Simeon cloud) you’ll be leading instead of following on the cloud mdr front.  \n\nThe comparison between huntress and BlackPoint isn’t exactly fair - to use BP cloud mdr, you’re already on their MDR and SOC services, in essence you’re already paying for the SOC team to manage 365 events too. BP has some of the same limitations tho, they have a top 30 (or whatever it is now) events they detect and respond to. A starting point that will no doubt improve. Posture management is just ok unless there has need a major innovation recently.\n\nEither vendor is a good decision, but one is about 4x the cost, so keep that in mind.\nedits to fix spelling.\n\n### Comment ID kr00vac with +5 score by [(Crshjnke, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kr00vac/) (in reply to ID kqyhu20):\nOr why not let the client pick what happens with high alerts per customer?

Huntress has had an amazing reputation as a company around here for a while. And it’s clear you guys have a no BS approach to business. But when you guys started taking PE/VC money the community voiced concerns that product quality would drop in the forced pursuit of revenue. And then the M365 product was pushed out the door and AMs started pushing it hard to partners, and over the last 6 months it’s become apparent that the product was not finished and still isn’t finished, its lead to a false sense of security. It seems reasonable to conclude the product launch was rushed to chase revenue to appease the investors. I also haven’t seen much innovation on Curricula.

BPC has caught for us, in the last two months:\n\n* Someone that was cheating a CA policy with a VPN.\n* Clients with VPN issues, VPS issues\n* Three impossible travel scenarios.\n* Four MFA bypass attacks with full Conditional Access in place (with number matching and GeoFiltering)\n* Several false positives on endpoints that were related to admittedly suspicious Powershell.\n\nLook, I won't say everything's perfect (and they 100% know who this is, by my Reddit name - Hi Britt, Will, Xav, Jon, Mo...), their portal needs *work*, for example, but damn if they aren't responsive as hell and actively developing for the MSP community. I'll have a testimonial out for their SOC (which is... spectacular and knowledgable) at Right of Boom in a few weeks.\n\nI've had to move some stuff along occasionally, and I am 100% sure their team is sick of my crap, but... I *really* do not want to leave them. I'm feeling like we won't, and if we were, it 100% wouldn't be technical - I have much faith in their SOC, both the endpoint agent and the 365 monitoring.\n\nWhen I looked at Huntress, they were equally amazing and powerful. We didn't choose them for two reasons:\n\n* I don't need Process Insights (their EDR). Our clients use the highest rated, best performing EDR - Defender.\n* It was very clear to me after *several* meetings (Again, I love what they do for the community, and their team is very obviously top notch, so I really did try with Huntress) that they would only send recommendations, not take action besides isolation. This may very well have changed, of course, but that was the case last year.\n\nBoth are awesome - BPC is more expensive and I believe it to be more fully featured. I'll happily answer more questions around here too - feel free to check out my post history, I work for an MSP, not for either org.\n\n### Comment ID kqy4i75 with +4 score by [(cassini12, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqy4i75/) (in reply to ID kqy1xoq):\nThank you for your great answer! Makes me feel like I am not alone in my thinking or expectations from a SOC. It seems almost very surprising that a company as \"together\" as Huntress would allow for such a hands off approach.\n\nI will more than likely move my clients to BP. I do have a question for you regarding your statement on EDR. A few webinars with Huntress in fact that I attended very much echoed your sentiment about the best EDR being Defender. Since my clients are almost all Business Prem licensed we have been toying with the idea of ditching  Sentinel One and just using Defender. (example: BP Snap + Cloud Response + Defender)  Is this what you are doing for day to day security? I will admit we roll with S1/Huntress as its pretty much set and forget and I was under the impression that Defender would require a decent amount of \"configuring\" before it was at the same level? Your thoughts?  (I did just receive the book on Defender this past week, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint In Depth)\n\n#### Comment ID kqy7e3g with +3 score by [(FlavonoidsFlav, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqy7e3g/) (in reply to ID kqy4i75):\nI actually really like BPC's \"Configure en Masse\" portal - allowing you to make a single policy (admittedly more Windows Defender AV than Defender for Endpoint), but yes - our preference is Defender for Endpoint/BPC for daily use.\n\nThe only majorly configurable settings in MDE are pretty easy, and easy to replicate across many clients. MDE is massively powerful and has things like Attack Surface Reduction, etc, and a ton of vulnerability stuff. It's immediately as good as S1 (turn on tamper protection), and can be *much* more deeply integrated in Windows... because Microsoft :)\n\n#### Comment ID kr00k5g with +4 score by [(jpete99, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kr00k5g/) (in reply to ID kqy4i75):\nHuntress costs significantly less than BP. Their slogan is \"security for the 99%\" and that means there are a few tradeoffs. It may not be a fit for you, but I would try to keep this in mind when comparing how Huntress and BP handle response.\n\nIn our case, we've been able to deploy Huntress to 100% of our clients and that wouldn't have been possible with BP.\n\n## Comment ID kqzc0yi with +4 score by [(jhartnerd123, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqzc0yi/) (in reply to ID 1atjpws):\nMy MSP/MSSP also uses BP and we have also now been fully implementing their Google Workspace integrations. So now we have full eyes on glass and hands on keyboards watching over clients using either MS or Google. I can confirm that their SOC WILL action alerts even before they pick up the phone. I sleep sound at night.\n\n## Comment ID kr35l1s with +6 score by [(tstone8, Reddit, 2024-02-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kr35l1s/) (in reply to ID 1atjpws):\nVery new to blackpoint but I’ve had similar experiences. When we were on boarding ourselves we got the 365 integration configured and within a few minutes some of our contractors in Kenya’s accounts were restricted. Once confirming to Blackpoint SOC they were legitimate logins they were unlocked immediately and then a full report provided within minutes. Also had some minor deployment issues with an environment and their support team couldn’t have been better to work with on finding a workaround and committing to determine the root cause of the issue. Still early on in our journey with them but i couldn’t be happier with their services.\n\n## Comment ID kqyayrq with +3 score by [(Real_Admin, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqyayrq/) (in reply to ID 1atjpws):\nYeah we use BP, if it's going to trigger a response, they act then notify in my experience.

I know, testing is extremely difficult, but we have had many discussions and invested so many hours, looking at the solutions, carried out ransomware testing on VMs, etc. That was about half a year ago and Blackpoint cut the best figure. Both in terms of know-how and the solution itself. Many solutions such as Arctic Wolf etc. simply fall through the net because they only send an email saying \"hey there's something, take a look\" but that doesn't help us if it's at 3 a.m. and we're all sleeping like babies... \n\nThe M365 integration is also extremely important, as we are an MS Shop and work with Defender for Endpoint, Servers. \n\nIn the end, we and our customers (the internal IT management) were convinced by the maturity of the product as well as the processes undertaken by BP. Laura as well as Mo (hi there) were also able to help us close a huge deal with one of our larger customers. \n\nSince implementing BP they have blocked several logins etc. Even though we have CA policies and follow best practices you never have a guarantee and that is what Blackpoint is for. \nSecurity is like an onion, you have to look at it in layers and layers, and one of them is a SOC these days but is never a guarantee.\n\n## Comment ID kqxxxfi with +9 score by [(brokerceej, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqxxxfi/) (in reply to ID 1atjpws):\nWe've been using Blackpoint since they were a small shop.

Even going through PAX8 you need to check to ensure monthly that you are being billed the correct amount of overages for both devices and licensed users. Device commitments will go up if you don’t decommission machines from BP. This includes renamed or reimaged devices. Also they go by licensed users for M365 and this will include Microsoft Teams resource accounts or any other licensed user that doesn’t have a mailbox. Their billing has been a nightmare for us and we are constantly requesting them to credit us. The SOC is great, but the UI is very buggy and the billing is a nightmare.\n\n## Comment ID kqxxon8 with +5 score by [(johnsonflix, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1atjpws/blackpoint_cyber_huntress/kqxxon8/) (in reply to ID 1atjpws):\nI have ran them both.

BP was full aware they had an MSP but told them they are close enough to SMB where they could sell direct. Internal IT told me as just a heads up BP has no problem selling to us. We were unaware BP operated like that. Some back and forth and unhappy calls later and we’re trying out Perch now. We didn’t have a whole lot of clients with the service and we’re already in the ConnectWise environment so it was an easy transition over.

In addition, promotions are scarce at best. The most deserving wait years to potentially get promoted, most are still stagnant in their roles while outside hires supersede them. The Huntress product development also was top notch. Recently, the company decided to focus only on sales and encouraged the sales teams to promote products that were not ready.

That goes for my direct teammates, manager, the c-suite and everyone in between. \n\nI recently had the pleasure of meeting all of these people in person at our summit. The energy, positivity and can-do attitude in those rooms was truly unique. I feel we as a collective are excited by our work protecting the 99% from cyber attacks. There is a deep sense of purpose there. \n\nFrom the get-go, I felt like Huntress invested in me. Which in turn made me motivated to invest my time, skills and growth right back. I’m given the tools, equipment and resources I need to do my job well. Feedback is encouraged and welcomed. Absolutely the best company culture, benefits and competitive pay. \n\nI feel lucky to be apart of this company.",

We have grown our headcount by 100% in the last year and revenue by the same in the previous few years.

          "cons": "I am loathe to have to write this, but I feel like I have to warn prospects and current leaders about the culture at the company (doubt they'll care). Huntress is succeeding despite it's best efforts to sabotage itself. And I want it to succeed.\n\nHuntress's culture has declined to the point that the direction of the company is in the balance. Employees no longer have any loyalty, because of a lack of a feeling of job security. Loyalty and pride used to be main drivers behind employee morale. The pride everyone used to have is waning, as they realize the company does not care about them at all. Employees are feeling like they're just a cog in the wheel.\n\nThe company cycles through leaders in all departments so quickly that there is no loyalty or feeling of job security. Every department's leadership has cycled numerous times in just a few years, except the one that needs a refresh. Once leaders leave, the current employees are no longer supported by the new crew, and many often are cycled out also.\n\nThe company is led by founders without business chops or background. If you don't play their bro game, you're out. They are executing a playbook to cycle out leaders every 12-18 months, a strategy that may have benefits in the short term, but destroys culture and morale. The founders have no clue how to lead or what is needed at each position, and it shows. No sophisticated leader would follow this juvenile strategy. \n\nWhile I do not think it's intentional, the leadership style by the founders is that of fear. Yes, it's their company (although now at Series D, they have board bosses that should step in). Look, the founders had a great idea, designed a sweet product, and built a good company. But, they have not evolved as leaders with the stage of the company. Instead of seeing that, the problem is always someone else. Nobody ever meets their standards, communication is ineffective or nonexistent, and role definitions change or are misunderstood. Instead of bringing people along and up, the founders lead by fear and cycle out bodies for the new shiny toy. Really great, super qualified employees are not up-leveled or refreshed to retain them-the company mindset is apparently we can just go get someone else. Everyone is afraid to disagree or to take initiative, as it's always \"wrong.\" Beloved leaders and employees are being purged for \"the next stage\" -- a next stage that nobody seems to understand. \n\nImportantly, no one feels like they'll be a part of the future they talk about. When founders talk about massive future growth, the eye rolls start as most do not think they'll be a part of it. If the company ever goes public, it will likely do so without anyone who was a part of its growth stages. That is jarring. Only the founders will ring that bell. Other leaders who have the background, chops, and institutional knowledge will have left a company they help grow gangbusters. It's bonkers.\n\nThe culture has suffered. Almost everyone is actively looking for positions elsewhere, and aren't even quiet about it--from those here 6 months to those with 4 years behind them. Largely because they just don't know when they'll get the boot, and the constant stress of long hours and unknown as to whether it's enough (it never is).\n\nIf they did an actual anonymous poll, instead of one where replies can be tracked back (data broken down so granular is not anonymous), they'd get more candid feedback.\n\nFinally, do not believe all of the glowing reviews--the company incentivized people to positively review. \n\nYes, outwardly the branding is cool and the products kick butt. But inwardly, culture is toxic and future perceptions are bleak.\n\nSmoke and mirrors.\n\nThe company needs a pause and reset.",

We noted this post was also cross-posted to Reddit, so the feelings are clearly real and strong.    \n\nWe love transparency and appreciate that Glassdoor asks both teammates and the company to share perspectives.  So we would be remiss to not share some data (which we share with radical transparency at monthly all-company Town Halls so our teammates can personally track the details) and reactions-\n\n-\tAttrition rates for the year are in the single digits, and trending down. Headcount has grown 2x in the last two years, and we are planning for the same in the next two, because . . . \n\n-\tEach of our four products are growing at industry-leading rates, and current customer revenue retention rates are a world-class 140%. Suffice to say, our Product dev team is second to none, and, the Huntress secret sauce to developing differentiated, high-value, managed solutions continues to sustain our hyper-growth! Investors have piled boat loads of cash into our cause the last few years for us to continue proliferating the 'Huntress Way' to wrecking hackers. \n\n-\t90 teammates (~ 1/3 of 1+ yr tenured workforce) have been promoted or earned another career growth opportunity as part of our 2x / yr compensation and promo review process.  Many more than this received merit-based pay adjustments. Every promotion has been shown and celebrated at Town Halls (aka- “Movers &amp; Shakers”) so all teammates know who they are.\n\n-\tAlso, every name &amp; face of our 150+ hires and the handful of leavers have also been shown, so all teammates can clearly track who’s coming and going. \n\n-\tWe recently won an Inc. best places to work award (granted exclusively on employee feedback from a survey they ran).  Our recent semi-annual anonymous (guaranteed by the vendor we utilize) survey showed a huge leap in employee net promotor score (58 - considered top tier in tech industry) \n\n-\tFollowing our anonymous in-house surveys, we ask people to post externally to Glassdoor (aka- “You’ve shared your voice with us in this survey; now we ask that you tell the world”).  We encourage people to post transparently and authentically how they are feeling- not directing what to say.  And of course there’s no way to incentivize posts with it all being anonymous.\n\n\nIn summary, every data point shared here is shared with all teammates monthly, as we embrace radical transparency.  In short, our BA hacker talent has driven extraordinary growth, enabling us to continually invest more into growing our teammates, and there’s no end in site.  Two things have remained true for nine years and will continue:\n*Hackers gonna hack.\n*Huntress gonna hunt.",

        "cons": "I am loathe to have to write this, but I feel like I have to warn prospects and current leaders about the culture at the company (doubt they'll care). Huntress is succeeding despite it's best efforts to sabotage itself. And I want it to succeed.\n\nHuntress's culture has declined to the point that the direction of the company is in the balance. Employees no longer have any loyalty, because of a lack of a feeling of job security. Loyalty and pride used to be main drivers behind employee morale. The pride everyone used to have is waning, as they realize the company does not care about them at all. Employees are feeling like they're just a cog in the wheel.\n\nThe company cycles through leaders in all departments so quickly that there is no loyalty or feeling of job security. Every department's leadership has cycled numerous times in just a few years, except the one that needs a refresh. Once leaders leave, the current employees are no longer supported by the new crew, and many often are cycled out also.\n\nThe company is led by founders without business chops or background. If you don't play their bro game, you're out. They are executing a playbook to cycle out leaders every 12-18 months, a strategy that may have benefits in the short term, but destroys culture and morale. The founders have no clue how to lead or what is needed at each position, and it shows. No sophisticated leader would follow this juvenile strategy. \n\nWhile I do not think it's intentional, the leadership style by the founders is that of fear. Yes, it's their company (although now at Series D, they have board bosses that should step in). Look, the founders had a great idea, designed a sweet product, and built a good company. But, they have not evolved as leaders with the stage of the company. Instead of seeing that, the problem is always someone else. Nobody ever meets their standards, communication is ineffective or nonexistent, and role definitions change or are misunderstood. Instead of bringing people along and up, the founders lead by fear and cycle out bodies for the new shiny toy. Really great, super qualified employees are not up-leveled or refreshed to retain them-the company mindset is apparently we can just go get someone else. Everyone is afraid to disagree or to take initiative, as it's always \"wrong.\" Beloved leaders and employees are being purged for \"the next stage\" -- a next stage that nobody seems to understand. \n\nImportantly, no one feels like they'll be a part of the future they talk about. When founders talk about massive future growth, the eye rolls start as most do not think they'll be a part of it. If the company ever goes public, it will likely do so without anyone who was a part of its growth stages. That is jarring. Only the founders will ring that bell. Other leaders who have the background, chops, and institutional knowledge will have left a company they help grow gangbusters. It's bonkers.\n\nThe culture has suffered. Almost everyone is actively looking for positions elsewhere, and aren't even quiet about it--from those here 6 months to those with 4 years behind them. Largely because they just don't know when they'll get the boot, and the constant stress of long hours and unknown as to whether it's enough (it never is).\n\nIf they did an actual anonymous poll, instead of one where replies can be tracked back (data broken down so granular is not anonymous), they'd get more candid feedback.\n\nFinally, do not believe all of the glowing reviews--the company incentivized people to positively review. \n\nYes, outwardly the branding is cool and the products kick butt. But inwardly, culture is toxic and future perceptions are bleak.\n\nSmoke and mirrors.\n\nThe company needs a pause and reset.",

In addition, promotions are scarce at best. The most deserving wait years to potentially get promoted, most are still stagnant in their roles while outside hires supersede them. The Huntress product development also was top notch. Recently, the company decided to focus only on sales and encouraged the sales teams to promote products that were not ready.

      "# [Understanding the ConnectWise ScreenConnect CVE-2024-1709 & CVE-2024-1708](https://www.huntress.com/blog/a-catastrophe-for-control-understanding-the-screenconnect-authentication-bypass)\nOn February 19, 2024, ConnectWise published a security advisory for ScreenConnect version 23.9.8, referencing two vulnerabilities and software weaknesses. The same day, Huntress researchers worked to understand this threat and successfully recreated a proof-of-concept exploit demonstrating its impact.\n\nThis write-up will discuss our analysis efforts and the technical details behind this attack, which we’re coining as “SlashAndGrab.”\n\nThe ConnectWise advisory indicated that in all versions of ScreenConnect below 23.9.8 there were two vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2024-1709: Authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel (CWE-288)\n\nCVE-2024-1708: Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory (“path traversal”) (CWE-22)\n\nThe first vulnerability was disclosed with a critical base CVSS scoring of 10, the highest possible severity. The authentication bypass would ultimately open the door for the second vulnerability.\n\nConnectWise made a patch available and expressed that all on-premise versions of ScreenConnect 23.9.7 and below must be updated immediately—cloud instances were already automatically patched.\n\nAt the time of release, the ConnectWise advisory was very sparse on technical details. There was not much information available as to what these vulnerabilities really consisted of, how they might be taken advantage of, or any other threat intelligence or indicators of compromise to hunt for.\n\nOnce we recreated the exploit and attack chain, we came to the same conclusion: there should not be public details about the vulnerability until there had been adequate time for the industry to patch. It would be too dangerous for this information to be readily available to threat actors.\n\nBut, with other vendors now publicly sharing the proof-of-concept exploit, the cat is out of the bag. We now feel that sharing our analysis shares no more threat than what is already available. So, we’re ready to spill the beans.\n\nThe “exploit” is trivial and embarrassingly easy.\n\nBelow is a video demonstration of our recreated proof-of-concept exploit, which performs the simple authentication bypass but takes it a step further to showcase remote code execution.\n\nOur Analysis\n\nWhen the Huntress team was made aware of the ConnectWise advisory, our team began to dig into what changes were made in the patch that could help explain what these vulnerabilities were.\n\nWe could simply look for the differences between code present in the new, patched version, and the previous, unpatched version. Creating a local testing environment for both of these states of the ScreenConnect software, we could easily see the delta that might clue us into the potential exploit.\n\nWe observed that these files differed:\n\nCVE-2024-1709 - Authentication Bypass\n\nMost of these changes observed in the new version were binary files, which require decompilation to compare; however, [.highlight]SetupWizard.aspx[.highlight] is a text file. When looking at the differences in this file, it immediately looked promising:\n\nIn the newest update, we can see there is a new check to ensure that the instance is set up before allowing the user to use the setup wizard. This piqued our interest as, at face value, version 23.9.7 already blocked access to the setup wizard after authentication. Looking closer into [.highlight]ScreenConnect.SetupModule[.highlight] inside of [.highlight]ScreenConnect.Web.dll[.highlight] sheds more light on the exploitation path.\n\nIn previous versions of ScreenConnect, this handler was registered for the [.highlight]OnBeginRequest[.highlight] event, while in 28.9.8 it is registered for the [.highlight]OnPostMapRequestHandler[.highlight] event. This was seemingly done so that the [.highlight]context.Handler[.highlight] field will be populated. A new check is added to validate if the resolved HTTP handler implements the new [.highlight]ISetupHandler[.highlight] interface whereas the old code simply checked that [.highlight]Request.Path[.highlight] string matched “[.highlight]/SetupWizard.aspx[.highlight]”. This change implies that there was some way to bypass the string comparison of [.highlight]Request.Path[.highlight] in previous versions. If the request path does not match “[.highlight]/SetupWizard.aspx[.highlight],” then the setup wizard will be allowed regardless of the setup state of the instance.\n\nThis would normally not be exploitable, but .Net has weird functionality that allows URL path components after a mapped legitimate URL to be passed along to the application. This information is exposed in [.highlight]Request.FilePath[.highlight], [.highlight]Request.PathInfo[.highlight] and [.highlight]Request.Path[.highlight]. For example, if there is a legitimate path “[.highlight]/something.aspx[.highlight]”, then .Net will allow the user to request “[.highlight]/something.aspx/anythingelse[.highlight]” and will pass along the trailing bit after the file path via the [.highlight]Request.PathInfo[.highlight]. However, [.highlight]Request.Path[.highlight] always contains both [.highlight]Request.FilePath[.highlight] and [.highlight]Request.PathInfo[.highlight] per MSDN documentation:\n\nPutting this together, it means we can simply request “[.highlight]/SetupWizard.aspx/literallyanything[.highlight]” and we should be allowed to access the setup wizard on already-configured ScreenConnect instances.\n\nThe setup wizard is responsible for setting up the initial administrative user and installing a license on the system during initial setup. The user creation portion of this setup happens immediately after clicking the “Next” button on the setup page, so there is no need to complete the setup wizard fully to exploit the system (i.e. you do not need to replace or have access to a valid license key). Completing this step will completely overwrite the internal user database. All other local users will be deleted aside from the user you specify in the setup wizard.\n\nOnce you have administrative access to a compromised instance, it is trivial to create and upload a malicious ScreenConnect extension to gain Remote Code Execution (RCE). This is not a vulnerability, but a feature of ScreenConnect, which allows an administrator to create extensions that execute .Net code as [.highlight]SYSTEM[.highlight] on the ScreenConnect server.\n\nCVE-2024-1708 - Path Traversal\n\nThe second vulnerability referenced in the ConnectWise ScreenConnect advisory presents a risk of ZipSlip attacks. We observed changes to [.highlight]ScreenConnect.Core.dll[.highlight]:\n\nand [.highlight]ScreenConnect.Server.dll[.highlight]:\n\nThis adds new function arguments to strictly handle file paths when extracting content from a ZIP file. Looking through the code base, we can see these utility functions only seem to be used when handling ScreenConnect extensions. Prior to this patch, a malicious extension could potentially write files anywhere within [.highlight]C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ScreenConnect\\App_Extensions[.highlight] instead of being properly restricted to their extension subdirectory.\n\nWhile this is another vulnerability fixed in version [.highlight]23.9.8[.highlight] that could lead to remote code execution in certain conditions, it relies upon having administrative credentials and access to be able to use the Extensions functionality. This capability is “unlocked” by the authentication bypass, but is less severe on its own.\n\nIn our recreated proof-of-concept exploit, taking advantage of this potential ZipSlip attack vector was not necessary; after gaining administrator access with the authentication bypass, it was already possible to run arbitrary code with the typical Extensions feature set. The primary difference being that malicious code written using this vulnerability does not necessarily need an installed extension to execute. This means that it may go unnoticed more easily within your environment. Any [.highlight].aspx[.highlight] or [.highlight].ashx[.highlight] files within the root of [.highlight]C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ScreenConnect\\App_Extensions\\[.highlight] are likely malicious artifacts. ScreenConnect does not place any files within this directory normally.\n\nDetection Guidance\n\nWhile researching the above vulnerabilities, Huntress identified Indicators Of Compromise (IOCs) and developed a set of detections that can be used to notify ScreenConnect users of potential malicious activity.\n\nAs a reminder, per Huntress’s previous post, the below listed SIGMA rules that leverage Windows Event ID 4663 requires that the Advanced Auditing policy be configured, and an appropriate SACL applied to the directory. Please refer to the previous blog post for how to generate this event.\n\nCVE-2024-1709 - Authentication Bypass\n\nWhile replicating the Authentication Bypass exploit, Huntress observed IIS logs for the malicious [.highlight]SetupWizard.aspx[.highlight] URL path, which can be used as an indicator of compromise:\n\nThe following Sigma rule will detect requests made to [.highlight]SetupWizard.aspx[.highlight] with a trailing path segment. This behavior is never legitimate, and should clearly indicate malicious intent if observed in the wild.\n\nAfter accessing the Setup Wizard, an attacker will input new credentials to gain access to Screen Connect. Doing so will write a new user database to a temporary XML file. The following Sigma rule can be used to detect the ScreenConnect server writing to a temporary XML file on the server. While this may be an indicator of compromise, this activity is known to also be observed when legitimately modifying local users or their permissions in ScreenConnect, so there is a non-zero false positive rate.\n\nThe following YARA rule is similar to the IIS log Sigma rule given above. It will detect IIS log entries that reference [.highlight]SetupWizard.aspx[.highlight] with a trailing path component. As mentioned previously, a trailing path component on this file is always associated with malicious activity.\n\nCVE-2024-1708 - Path Traversal\n\nThe path traversal exploit allows attackers to write files within the root of the [.highlight]App_Extensions[.highlight] directory. The following Sigma rule should alert on file modifications at the root of the [.highlight]App_Extensions[.highlight] directory while excluding legitimate modifications to extensions themselves.",
      "# [Huntress Unveils ‘Intuitive’ SIEM Offering Tailored To MSPs, SMBs by Kyle Alspach](https://www.crn.com/news/security/2024/huntress-unveils-intuitive-siem-offering-tailored-to-msps-smbs)\nThe vendor’s expansion into SIEM provides a new option that is less complicated and more affordable than competing platforms, while still providing a major improvement to security outcomes, Huntress CTO Chris Bisnett tells CRN.\n\nHuntress unveiled its new managed SIEM offering that aims to be a less-complicated and more-affordable alternative focused on the unique needs of MSPs and their SMB customers, according to Huntress Co-founder and CTO Chris Bisnett.\n\nThe expansion by Huntress into SIEM (security information and event management) is part of the vendor’s efforts at continuing to enable MSPs with a wider array of offerings on one platform for boosting SMB security outcomes, Bisnett said. It’s also significant because SIEM has traditionally been considered too complex and expensive for MSPs, he noted.\n\n[Related: Huntress CEO On Raising $150M To ‘Democratize’ SIEM, Data Protection For SMBs]\n\nAs it’s now being offered by Huntress, SIEM constitutes a “huge” opportunity for MSPs, Bisnett said. Key differentiators for the Huntress managed SIEM offering include using highly efficient data collection and retention techniques to keep costs predictable and minimal, which is crucial for service providers, he said.\n\n“It allows us to just drop out significant amounts of data that ultimately has little to no security relevance,” Bisnett said.\n\nAccording to one MSP and Huntress partner, the expansion by the vendor into SIEM is a welcome move, which is seeing Huntress bring the same streamlined approach to SIEM that it has previously to endpoint and Microsoft 365 security. The Huntress SIEM provides “one central location where we can calculate and collect a lot of our security data and metrics,” said Marcel Pawlowski, security engineer at Microtime Computers, an Andover, Mass.-based MSP.\n\nThe result, Pawlowski said, is that using the Huntress SIEM “really ups our digital forensics and incident response capabilities, while not being overly complicated.”\n\n‘Perfect Balance’\n\nGiven that Microtime has four people in its security and engineering department, the MSP isn’t able to staff a 24/7 security team, he noted. The Huntress SIEM provides a “perfect balance” to boost the MSP’s security operations capabilities with its level of staffing, according to Pawlowski.\n\n“I don't need to look at it every day. But at the same time, if an incident happens, I know the data is all there, it's accurate, the data sources are configured properly,” he said. “So it's everything that an MSP is looking for basically.”\n\nPawlowski said he has used a number of SIEM systems previously in his career, many of which were clunky and difficult to set up. During usage of the Huntress offering while in private beta, Microtime has found the SIEM to be a refreshing change, he said.\n\nIn particular, the user interface is “designed in a way that is very intuitive for somebody who hasn't used a SIEM before,” Pawlowski said. “The query mechanism is very simple. It uses a unified language that the documentation is very clear on. So it's effectively a pickup-and-go sort of solution. Anybody can do it.”\n\nThe launch of the Huntress managed SIEM offering follows the company’s June fundraise of $150 million aimed at accelerating its expansion into new product segments.\n\nIn addition to SIEM, the SMB-focused managed cybersecurity vendor is eyeing additional categories such as security posture management, as well as offerings that will “reinvent” data backup and recovery, Huntress Co-Founder and CEO Kyle Hanslovan told CRN previously.",
      "# [Cleo Software Actively Being Exploited in the Wild CVE-2024-55956](https://www.huntress.com/blog/threat-advisory-oh-no-cleo-cleo-software-actively-being-exploited-in-the-wild)\nCVE-2024-55956 Summary\n\nOn December 3, Huntress identified an emerging threat involving Cleo’s LexiCom, VLTransfer, and Harmony software, commonly used to manage file transfers. We’ve directly observed evidence of threat actors exploiting this software en masse and performing post-exploitation activity. Although Cleo published an update and advisory for CVE-2024-50623—which allows unauthenticated remote code execution—Huntress security researchers have recreated the proof of concept and learned the patch does not mitigate the software flaw.\n\n‍TL;DR - This vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild and fully patched systems running 5.8.0.21 are still exploitable. We strongly recommend you move any internet-exposed Cleo systems behind a firewall until a new patch is released.\n\nBased on our analysis, all versions prior to and including 5.8.0.21 are vulnerable:\n\nCleo Harmony® (5.8.0.21)\n\nCleo VLTrader® (5.8.0.21)\n\nCleo LexiCom® (5.8.0.21)\n\nOur team is working to reach the Cleo team to report our findings and develop a new patch to fully mitigate exploitation. This blog will be frequently updated as more details emerge.\n\nTradecraft We Observed\n\nThe three software solutions Harmony, VLTrader, and LexiCom are often installed in the root of the filesystem, as the suggested default in their installation process:\n\nWe have also observed installation folders in the typical [.highlight]C:\\Program Files (x86)[.highlight] directory. Inside the installation folder are numerous subdirectories, with some more pertinent to the tradecraft than others:\n\n[.highlight]logs\\[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]host\\[.highlight]\n\n[.highlight]autorun\\[.highlight]\n\n(etc.)\n\nAs an example, we would find logs in a full path: [.highlight]C:\\LexiCom\\logs\\LexiCom.xml[.highlight]. Below is a record of the logs following threat actor exploitation:\n\nThere are multiple things to note in this log snippet:\n\nThe first artifact of the attack chain is [.highlight]autorun\\healthchecktemplate.txt[.highlight].\n\nAutorun files are immediately read, interpreted, and evaluated by LexiCom, Harmony, and VLTrader. We believe this is one of multiple files dropped onto the filesystem via the arbitrary file-write vulnerability. Files placed in the [.highlight]autorun[.highlight] folder are immediately deleted following their processing. Note: We have also seen [.highlight]autorun\\healthcheck.txt[.highlight] used as well.\n\n‍\n\nA “Warning” on the second entry indicates this instance is running version 5.8.0.0, which is the unpatched version. Our proof of concept, which we will discuss below, successfully exploits version 5.8.0.21.\n\nThe [.highlight]healthchecktemplate.txt[.highlight] autorun looks to invoke “Import” functionality, which is native and natural functionality of the Cleo software.\n\nThe Import process reads in from a local file on disk. In this case, it loads [.highlight]temp\\LexiCom6836057879780436035.tmp,[.highlight] which we believe to be a second file dropped via the arbitrary file-write vulnerability. This .tmp file is actually a .ZIP file, containing a subdirectory [.highlight]hosts[.highlight] with an inner [.highlight]main.xml[.highlight] file, as you see imported.\n\nThe [.highlight]main.xml[.highlight] file observed from in-the-wild exploitation contains:\n\nNote the specific (and mischievous) date and timestamps: 2020/10/10 00:00:00 😉\n\nThis [.highlight]main.xml[.highlight] file stages a new autorun with an action (presumably built out to be [.highlight]healthcheck.txt[.highlight]) to invoke a PowerShell command and gain code execution. Unfortunately, the [.highlight]healthchecktemplate.txt[.highlight] and [.highlight]healthcheck.txt[.highlight] files placed in the autoruns subdirectory were automatically deleted and we do not yet know their contents.\n\n‍\n\nThe decoded PowerShell command has been observed with this structure:\n\nThis process reaches out to an external IP address to retrieve new JAR files for continued post-exploitation. These JAR files contain webshell-like functionality for persistence on the endpoint.\n\nWe observed attackers later deleting these JAR files post-execution in order to prolong their attacks and stay relatively stealthy.\n\nAlso within the same logs folder, there may be a LexiCom.dbg log file. It will also contain information about any malicious autoruns files that have been processed, like so:‍\n\nFor further post-exploitation, the threat actors were observed enumerating potential Active Directory assets with domain reconnaissance tools like nltest.exe.\n\nHuntress EDR depicts this child-parent process relationship like so:\n\n‍\n\nObserved IP addresses for callbacks\n\n[.highlight]176.123.5.126[.highlight] - AS 200019 (AlexHost SRL) - Moldova\n\n[.highlight]5.149.249.226[.highlight] - AS 59711 (HZ Hosting Ltd) - Netherlands\n\n[.highlight]185.181.230.103[.highlight] - AS 60602 (Inovare-Prim SRL) - Moldova\n\n[.highlight]209.127.12.38[.highlight] - AS 55286 (SERVER-MANIA / B2 Net Solutions Inc) - Canada\n\n[.highlight]181.214.147.164[.highlight] - AS 15440 (UAB Baltnetos komunikacijos) - Lithuania‍\n\n[.highlight]192.119.99.42[.highlight] - AS 54290 (HOSTWINDS LLC) - United States\n\n‍\n\nTargets Exploited\n\nFrom our telemetry, we’ve discovered at least 10 businesses whose Cleo servers were compromised with a notable uptick in exploitation observed on December 8 around 07:00 UTC. After some initial analysis, however, we have found evidence of exploitation as early as December 3.\n\nThe majority of customers that we saw compromised deal with consumer products, food industry, trucking, and shipping industries. There are still several other companies outside of our immediate view who are potentially compromised as well.\n\n‍\n\nThe Huntress Proof of Concept\n\nHuntress communicated with Cleo on December 9 after creating our proof of concept. Over a Zoom call, they confirmed our understanding and the recreation of the attack chain.\n\nPrincipal Security Researcher Caleb Stewart crafted a Python script that leverages the arbitrary file-write primitive to place files inside the [.highlight]autoruns[.highlight] subdirectory and prove its execution. This was tested successfully against LexiCom as well as VLTrader with both versions 5.8.0.0 and patched version 5.8.0.21.\n\nAt the time of writing, Cleo is preparing a new CVE designation and expects a new patch to be released mid-week.\n\n‍\n\nHow to Stay Protected\n\nAt the time of writing, the 5.8.0.21 patched versions are insufficient against the exploit we are seeing in the wild. Speaking over a Zoom call, Cleo expressed that they will have a new patch available as soon as possible.\n\nIn the interim, we have suggested mitigations in an attempt to limit the attack surface. Knowing that the latter half of this attack path relies on code execution via the [.highlight]autoruns[.highlight] directory, it is possible to reconfigure Cleo software to disable this feature. However, this will not prevent the arbitrary file-write vulnerability until a patch is released.\n\nGot to the “Configure” menu of LexiCom, Harmony, or VLTrader\n\nSelect “Options”\n\nNavigate to the “Other” pane\n\nDelete the contents of the “Autorun Directory” field\n\nThis will remove the ability to process Autorun files. Please apply your own risk and threat model here -- your mileage may vary if you know that you use this feature in production.\n\n‍\n\nIf you are not a Huntress partner, review the [.highlight]hosts[.highlight] subdirectory in your software installation directory to determine if you have been affected. The presence of a [.highlight]main.xml[.highlight] or a [.highlight]60282967-dc91-40ef-a34c-38e992509c2c.xml[.highlight] file (a name that looks to be reused across infections) with an embedded PowerShell-encoded command is a definitive indicator of compromise.\n\n‍\n\nHow Huntress Has Responded\n\nWe are actively detecting and neutralizing activity related to the exploit. To do so, we have taken a three-pronged approach to effectively detect, investigate, and respond to the threat.\n\nHuntress SOC analysts Austin Worline, Chad Hudson, Jai Minton, andTanner Filip created detections specifically conjured to hone in on and detect the activity triggered by the range of compromised Cleo products.\n\n‍\n\nIn tandem, Huntress analyst Amelia Casley generated an internal investigation guide to ensure that the global Huntress SOC team could triage this emerging threat in a scalable and consistent way to keep our community secure. This guide included a reusable CyberChef recipe to analyze the encoded PowerShell adversaries were deploying.\n\n‍\n\nFurthermore, Huntress neutralized this threat where it appeared on endpoints by leveraging the IP Blocking feature in Huntress Managed EDR. IP blocking adds a degree of cost to a threat actor, requiring them to rotate their infrastructure in order to reattempt a compromise. Once completed, we shared a detailed report with any impacted partners and customers.\n\n‍\n\nAppendix A:\n\nSigma rules\n\n‍Possible Cleo MFT Exploitation 2024‍\n\nJavaw Spawning Suspicious PowerShell\n\n‍\n\nAppendix B:\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n‍\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n‍Special thanks to Jai Minton, Tanner Filip, Dray Agha, Austin Worline, Chad Hudson, Amelia Casley, Jamie Levy, John Hammond, Caleb Stewart, Matt Kiely, Matt Anderson, and others for their tireless efforts and contributions to this investigation and writeup.\n\n‍",

      "# [Python Huntress on 2023-11-03](https://pythonhuntress.com/about/)\nIn 2019, Amy was a real estate broker with a very successful business that she had built over 13 years. When she learned that there was a Burmese Python problem in Florida, she had to check it out because she has always had a fascination and passion for snakes and reptiles. So Amy scheduled a Florida vacation to see what it was all about. She connected with professional python hunter, Donna Kalil, and went on a hunt where we caught a beautiful 9-foot python.\n\nFor Amy, it was absolutely the best day ever and she was totally hooked!\n\nA few days after returning home, Amy knew she had to move to Florida and figure out how to be a Burmese Python hunter. Suddenly she knew how to use her passion as more than just a hobby. She could help Florida with this colossal problem and make a difference in the world. Within six weeks Amy sold her real estate client database, rented a room in Miami, packed a few things, and drove to Florida to start a new life.\n\nLooking at this decision logically, it was ridiculous and insane. The python hunting program was a trial and no one could tell Amy if it was going to continue or if they would ever hire additional hunters. She didn’t have a job lined up. She didn’t know the area or where to hunt pythons. She didn’t know anyone, including the people she was going to live with.\n\nWhen Amy moved to Florida, she was one of the first one hundred hunters hired by the state. She has caught over 600 Burmese Pythons, the biggest one being 17’ 3”, 110 lbs (by herself). She has raised close to $600,000 by donating hunts to charity auctions. She has been featured on TV programs, documentaries, magazine articles and podcasts, including The New York Times, National Geographic, Time Magazine, The Today Show, Fox and Friends, CNBC and Reader’s Digest. Amy has started her own guiding service to take people out on python hunts. Out of her love of snakes and a desire to make something good from their demise, she figured out how to use their skin to make leather products.\n\nOne thing people ALWAYS ask Amy is, ‘Why Snakes’? And she says, “I have no idea.” Her fascination began when she was a little girl. Her dad took her to a creek and showed her how to catch all kinds of critters. It was the snakes that captured her imagination and fascination, and turned into a passion.\n\nAmy thinks of it like a musician who can naturally hear and play notes, or an interior decorator who can easily put together a room. “It’s just how I was born.” Sometimes she wonders why it couldn’t have been kittens or puppies or something a little more normal, but it’s snakes!\n\nSnakes have always been a part of Amy’s world. She was a volunteer at the Toledo Zoo in college, a breeder, an educator, part of the exotic pet and veterinary industries, and she has traveled to many places to find, observe and enjoy them. Becoming a python hunter just seemed like a logical next step.\n\nThe Burmese Pythons are beautiful and fascinating and it’s not their fault they are here. Unfortunately, they have to be removed and there is no other option.",

It's been a long while since I given proper news on whats going on with the game, so I figured I'll let you know now.\n\nWay back in September/October of 2023 I hit a major wall with the game's development I hit a point where the game was heavily bogged down with art,code,and sounds to the point it actually was causing severe performance issues, some ow which made the game almost unplayable.\n\nHowever after months of experimenting with settings, approaches to handling parts of the game, etc. I was able to identify a clear strategy to optimize the game, and while taking an additional month to implement, it actually greatly improved performance, thus saving this project!\n\nA Big graphical overhaul!\n\nWith so much changes needed, I strongly felt the need to also revemp the games look and feel along with that to match this new and improved 'foundation' I built. Hence the Rebrand to \"Ruby: Huntress of Vale\" and with that a whole new UI. A new 'modern' looking UI for combat mode, nice accents, menus, and even new promotional images were done.\n\nThere is also new features like Ruby's Crescent Rose getting a new Sword Mode, and Shotgun Modification on its way as well!\n\nWe are also introducing a new playable character Penny! You can see some alpha footage here:\n\nAlso been working with a lot of talent in the FNDM to make custom voices for Combat Mode:\n\nAs you can see there is plenty to look forward to.

      "# [I genuinely want a Dev explanation for the PTR Huntress changes by RhysVMT on 2024-03-07](https://forums.bhvr.com/dead-by-daylight/discussion/407339/i-genuinely-want-a-dev-explanation-for-the-ptr-huntress-changes)\nThis is genuinely a \"what are they actually thinking\" tier change. Played several games VS her on PTR and she doesn't even have to mind game anymore. She can hold hatches and keep chase perfectly fine without any drawbacks anymore with little to no counterplay. Huntress was already strong in regards for her ability to force a 50/50 on pallets by respecting with a hatchet held, her only drawback and COUNTERPLAY was the reduced m/s holding said hatchets allowing survivors to gain distance and being able to break LoS more effectively with the reduced m/s.\n\nAnd please don't hit this thread with the \"she has bad maps so the buff is justified\", half the killers in the game have terrible maps, I main Legion and I'd be lying if half the big maps don't make me wanna insta DC, yet I don't see buffs on PTR for them. Not to mention the plethora of Killers in godawful states being left to rot in D- tier while A+ and above killers continue to receive buffs and QoL updates. By this logic we should be buffing ADS on deathslingers speeds to simular levels? Or does that narrative not count because he isn't as popular as Huntress. The double standards and lack of cognitive thought from the Devs on this series of buffs to Huntress is purely laughable. They haven't even shifted power from elsewhere in her kit to compensate like they have with Pig and the RBT times. Completely laughable that this is gonna make live servers, can't wait\n\nI'm not a dev, but if I had to guess, I would say that Huntress is being buffed because she's a free Killer that new players are struggling to win with. There are undoubtedly really skilled Huntresses out there, but I believe the majority are newer players who struggle to hit more than one hatchet per reload or are just average players. I think the really god Huntresses, the top-tier ones, won't even notice the buff that much. The 10 hatchet capacity is too much though.\n\nI used to main Huntress but had to drop her because there are more maps where she is useless than maps where she isn't. I believe the increased movement speed while holding a hatchet is reasonable because of these map issues, it will definitely reduce her reliance on specific realms.\n\nI don't really see why this buff is so outrageous, her numbers are being increased to keep up with the current state of maps, as she is one of the most map-dependent killers. Other killers should receive a similar treatment so that you don't immediately feel powerless as soon as you load into a match and see a map that literally counters you.\n\nTbf its been a while since I read that wall of text so ill just respond to that point by point\n\n6.0m/s is a high base speed but I feel like if you just set the speed to this (no need to ramp since this is already what it ramps to) then played around with duration depending on the map you could create a much more comfortable middle ground for getting a down in frenzy if you play right and survivors don't but not have it be guaranteed on a smaller map, if you could come up with some sort of mechanic that makes duration longer on bigger maps that might be a good change\n\nI think the power gauge currently pauses while vaulting a window or pallet but pausing while kicking a gen or breakable wall would be a niche change that doesn't really fit the power well so maybe just make it something fun like if you attack a generator during feral frenzy it begins regressing and extends your power duration by 1s (net loss of 0.5s and its not a 5% loss due to a kick so its not a regression event)\n\nChanging how it works with oblivious could open up more perk diversity for legion, usable perk wise hysteria and plaything would be kind of nutty so this would need to be tested since you can easily find and harass survivors without them being able to hear you coming making tunneling decently stronger since legions detection is stronger and his potential to double back and fatigue on a survivor who doesn't expect it.\n\nNo reason to hide blood during feral frenzy because if you are going for a hit on an injured survivor the reward is much less so making it easier makes sense. Legion having fatigue like nurse makes no sense a normal cooldown seems fine.\n\nChanging legions movement speed after frenzy to be 2.3m/s and ramping up to be 4.6m/s means on average during the fatigue animation the legion will move at 3.45m/s and the survivor will gain... 1.5m, yeah this one isn't way too balanced since distance wise unless they have something within 12m of where you ended your frenzy and use it immediately they go down since you lunge right after it ends and hit them. So this one is probably way too overturned.\n\nAddon changes aren't bad / are already in the game but recharging power on breaking a pallet / wall is kind of the direct upgrade to recharging power on a stun since you can use it in a similar way so maybe something like decreasing stun recovery while in frenzy by like 33% (not stacking because it would be silly with enduring) the only reason I say this is because I think it would be interesting of the mixtape addons had more synergy with each other because you know legion, group of people who kill together and the fact people might stack more of the addons that change their music tracks\n\nThank you for the addon consideration but I still have an issue with the movement speed part\n\nThe problem with changing the fatigue speed is just the math behind it, if you make it ramp linearly from 2.3m/s to 4.6m/s during that 2.7s the same math still applies the average speed would be 3.45m/s during that 2.7s (aka while you might be moving 2.3m/s for ~0.1s 2.4m/s for ~0.1s ect the average speed still ends up being 3.45m/s once you average it all out) meaning a survivor would only gain 1.5m during your fatigue slowdown and then during that last 0.3s end up 1.3m away before you can swing, while it might make the power more fluid it just ends up creating a different gameplay loop / killer instead of it being a quality of life, since one of the best ways to play would be cancel on top of a survivor and if they aren't on a pallet or at a window you instantly down them as opposed to gaining ~6m like current fatigue does considerably changing the killer because a ~11s window to react (fatigue time + time to catch back up) becomes more like a ~4s window to react now of course this doesn't count anywhere they might travel with a speed burst or while you catch up because things get even more complicated there.\n\nIf you make it ramp exponentially I got no clue how to do that in simple text based math but maybe it ends up being right but it might be hard to get your point across to other forums users if you give them the y=~x^2+2.3 (0,2.3) to (2.7, 4.6)\n\nA better change for it would just be to reduce fatigue time since you are just back to 4.6m/s faster or increase the movement speed while in fatigue directly rather than creating a ramping speed if you want to have solid numbers to rely on for how much of a buff you think it needs.",
      "# [Cybersecurity firm flags attack on construction accounting system by Matthew Thibault on 2024-09-18](https://www.constructiondive.com/news/cybersecurity-huntress-foundation-software-sql/727376/)\nThis audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.\n\nDive Brief:\n\nEllicott City, Maryland-based cybersecurity firm Huntress has discovered an emerging threat for users of Foundation Software, which bills itself as serving 43,000 construction professionals nationwide. In a Sept. 17 report, Huntress said plumbing, HVAC, concrete and similar subcontractors were actively impacted.\n\nHuntress described the hack as a “brute force” attack, where perpetrators use an automated trial-and-error engine to guess credentials or other sensitive information. The affected companies were using default credentials — i.e., usernames and passwords that come with the software on purchase and that are supposed to be changed on installation — at the time of the intrusion, according to Huntress.\n\nHuntress discovered about 500 hosts running the Foundation software from the 3 million-plus endpoints it monitors for its clients, according to the report. From that pool, the company confirmed that a sample of 33 hosts were publicly exposed with unchanged default credentials. On one impacted host, it observed more than 35,000 brute force login attempts.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nFoundation told Construction Dive that some of the information in the Huntress report was inaccurate, and said that affected users were limited to clients still using legacy software physically installed at their own companies — i.e., on premise — rather than via Foundation’s hosted environment.\n\nThe impacted clients did not follow the protocol of changing their user ID and password, said Mike Ode, Foundation’s CEO, who noted the firm hosts the vast majority of its customers via its software-as-a-service offering.\n\n“If you buy a software and you install it at your place, you are responsible for the security and the walls and the perimeter, right?” Ode told Construction Dive. “We're responsible for what we've been selling for the last decade, and that's a hosted solution.”\n\nHe urged impacted firms to adopt hosted software instead.\n\n“We want everybody in our SaaS-hosted environment, right? Let us do it. Let us take on the responsibility,” Ode said. He asserted the attack mentioned in the report may have impacted just a single client, but acknowledged he didn’t know for certain.\n\nThe risks\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency has said use of default passwords is a major cybersecurity issue and has been urging organizations to reset them.\n\nEven though the intrusions occurred, there was no compromise or malicious activity on those computers, said John Hammond, principal security researcher at Huntress. Hammond said that to protect themselves, contractors who use the software should change their credentials, including passwords.\n\nHuntress noted that Foundation uses Microsoft SQL in its software. The combined platforms feature two high-privilege administrative accounts, dubbed “sa” and “dba” within the system. If their default credentials are left unchanged upon installation, perpetrators can have an easy entryway into the software.\n\nWhen contacted, Microsoft pointed Construction Dive to its SQL security best practices web page.\n\nFor a hacker, Hammond described the effort needed to breach the impacted instances of Foundation’s software as “trivial,” and likened it to typing in a password.\n\n“Once a threat actor finds an on-premise Foundation server, they could authenticate as the database administrator, and enable new settings to do whatever they might like on the whole computer,” Hammond said. “Candidly, it takes just one command to log in, and just two more to do real damage.”\n\nHammond said bad actors could access sensitive information, such as credentials or financial details, as well as gain entry into the computer itself.\n\n“This is a foothold and initial access vector into a whole network, with administrator privileges right out of the gate,” Hammond told Construction Dive via email. “In some cases we have observed the SQL server installed directly onto an organization's domain controller, which means it is immediate keys to the kingdom for the entire environment.”",
      "# [Huntress warns of attacks on Foundation Software accounts by Arielle Waldman, Alexander Culafi on 2024-09-18](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/366611274/Huntress-warns-of-attacks-on-Foundation-Software-accounts)\nHuntress warned that attackers are targeting the construction industry with brute force attacks against accounting software accounts with default credentials.\n\nIn a blog post published Tuesday, the cybersecurity vendor detailed an emerging brute force attack campaign it first observed Sept. 14. The campaign is targeting customers of Foundation Software, which is commonly used in the construction industry for financial reporting and billing forms.\n\nMax Rogers, senior director of Huntress' threat operations center, flagged suspicious activity Sept. 14 in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Rogers said Huntress was seeing \"wide-spread attacks against Construction companies.\"\n\nAfter detecting suspicious activity, Huntress said it isolated affected machines and initiated an investigation. Additionally, the company notified any affected individuals and sent a \"precautionary advisory\" to any Huntress customer who uses Foundation in their environment.\n\nThe attack scope may be limited for now. Huntress said it discovered around 500 hosts running the Foundation software and that 33 of them were publicly exposed with unchanged default credentials. John Hammond, principal security researcher at Huntress, told TechTarget Editorial that although the numbers may appear small, there are third-party risks to consider as affected customers may internal connections to other organizations.\n\nThose concerns particularly apply to the 33 hosts with unchanged default passwords. Hammond said the security shortcoming provides attackers with \"immediate and open-door access.\" The blog post expanded on the scope and affected industries.\n\n\"Attackers have been observed brute forcing the software at scale, and gaining access simply by using the product's default credentials. We're seeing active intrusions among plumbing, HVAC, concrete, and similar sub-industries,\" Huntress wrote in the blog post.\n\nHuntress stated the attack takes advantage of publicly facing Foundation instances. Foundation uses the Microsoft SQL Server, which Huntress said is a database that includes a default system administrator account. If attackers compromise the account, dubbed \"sa,\" they can gain full administrative privileges over the entire server.\n\nHuntress observed that many high-privilege sa accounts still use default credentials, which unknown threat actors compromised through brute force attacks. Once threat actors access the accounts, they can use a feature called \"xp_cmdshell\" within SQL Server, which enables users to run operating system commands and scripts.\n\n\"On one host we observed ~35,000 brute force login attempts against the MSSQL server ending just an hour before a successful authentication and enabling xp_cmdshell to run commands,\" the blog post said.\n\nHuntress recommended that users rotate credentials for accounts connected to the Foundation database, disable xp_cmdshell if possible, and remove the application from the public internet wherever possible.\n\nTracie Kuczkowski, vice president of marketing at Foundation, sent the following statement to TechTarget Editorial:\n\n\"The event potentially impacted a small subset of on-premise FOUNDATION users. It did not at all impact the bulk of our accounting users, which are under our secure, cloud-based SaaS offering. It also did not impact our internal systems or any of our other product offerings through our subsidiary companies. As a result of not following recommendations and security best practices that were provided (one example being not resetting the default credentials), this small subset of on-premise users might face possible vulnerabilities. We have been communicating and providing technical support to these users to mitigate this.\"\n\nKuczkowski also said that Foundation is currently working with Huntress to \"correct the information they have posted.\"\n\nHammond provided TechTarget Editorial with more details on the disclosure process with Foundation. \"Huntress attempted to reach out to Foundation throughout the weekend but had not received a response until Monday. Speaking over the phone, Foundation confirmed the default credentials that we saw abused and that they had received reports from a small number of their customers,\" he said. \"They confirmed this was a default configuration for on-premises installations of the Foundation software.\"\n\nHammond also confirmed that communication with Foundation is ongoing.\n\n\"Huntress was in contact with Foundation as recently as yesterday. Over email, Foundation had asked for more specific statements to be included, suggesting their customers should follow their best practices and recommendations,\" he said. \"Upon asking Foundation for a link to their best practices guide & documentation, Huntress has not received a response.\"",
