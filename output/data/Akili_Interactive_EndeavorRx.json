      "# [EndeavorRx® - ADHD Video Game Treatment for Kids on 2021-08-05](https://www.endeavorrx.com/#subscribe-to-email-list)\nEndeavorRx:\n\nIndications, Safety and Cautions\n\nIndications:\n\nEndeavorRx is a digital therapeutic indicated to improve attention function as measured by computer-based testing in children ages 8-17 years old with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD, who have a demonstrated attention issue. Patients who engage with EndeavorRx demonstrate improvements in a digitally assessed measure, Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA®), of sustained and selective attention and may not display benefits in typical behavioral symptoms, such as hyperactivity. EndeavorRx should be considered for use as part of a therapeutic program that may include clinician-directed therapy, medication, and/or educational programs, which further address symptoms of the disorder.\n\nSafety:\n\nNo serious adverse events were reported. Of 342 participants who received AKL-T01 in the two clinical trials supporting EndeavorRx authorization for age ranges 8-17, 17 participants (4.97%) experienced treatment-related adverse events (TE-ADE) (possible, probable, likely). TE-ADEs reported at greater than 1% across the studies include: frustration tolerance decreased (2.34%) and headache (1.17%). Other adverse events occurred less than 1% and included dizziness, emotional disorder, nausea, and aggression. All adverse events were transient and no events led to device discontinuation. Across other studies in children and adolescents with ADHD, rates of adverse events were similarly low (<10%) and no Serious Adverse Events have been reported. All reported adverse events across all clinical trials resolved at the end of treatment. Users should consider the totality of evidence presented along with their health care provider when considering incorporating AKL-T01 into their treatment plan.\n\nCautions:\n\nRx only: Federal law restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a licensed health care provider. EndeavorRx should only be used by the patient for whom the prescription was written. For medical questions, please contact your child’s healthcare provider. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, please dial 911. EndeavorRx is not intended to be used as a stand-alone therapeutic and is not a substitution for your child’s medication.\n\nIf your child experiences frustration, emotional reaction, dizziness, nausea, headache, eye-strain, or joint pain while playing EndeavorRx pause the treatment. If the problem persists contact your child’s healthcare provider. If your child experiences a seizure stop the treatment and contact your child’s healthcare provider.\n\nEndeavorRx may not be appropriate for patients with photo-sensitive epilepsy, color blindness, or physical limitations that restrict use of a mobile device; parents should consult with their child’s healthcare provider.\n\nPlease follow all of your mobile device manufacturer’s instructions for the safe operation of your mobile device.

      "# [ADHD in The Workplace — Akili Interactive](https://www.akiliinteractive.com/workplacesurvey)\nEmployees with ADHD are navigating their careers with intention, but a lack of adequate support. To cultivate an inclusive and thriving work environment, companies must transcend conventional approaches and provide better guidance for managers, and more comprehensive support for employees. These insights emerge from the new ADHD in the Workplace Study conducted by Akili and Wakefield Research, shedding light on the need and opportunity for ADHD accommodations at work to maximize the potential of a neurodiverse workforce.\n\nInformation was collected from US employed adults¹: 500 US employed adults with ADHD and 500 US managers (with or without ADHD), to understand the everyday challenges and experiences of those with ADHD at work. The survey covered the impact of impairment, disclosure to employers, experiences of stigma, manager misconceptions, treatment options, and more.\n\nThe research revealed that employees with ADHD face compounding challenges at work that can sidetrack career goals and take a toll on mental health.\n\n87% of employees with ADHD report experiencing a negative impact of ADHD on their career\n\n97% feel they would be capable of accomplishing more if they could better manage their symptoms.\n\n95% feel limited by the number of treatment options available to them.\n\nEmployees with ADHD are seeking a more nuanced understanding and awareness from their supervisors of their strengths and needs for additional support, but managers feel unequipped to fully provide that support. Namely, 81% of managers report that they don’t feel completely prepared to appropriately address employee needs if an employee discloses an ADHD diagnosis.\n\nIf companies don’t take action to support their employees with ADHD, they run the risk of driving these employees away, with additional impacts on engagement and productivity. In light of the ongoing stimulant medication shortage (see FDA-DEA letter 2023), it has become even more urgent to support employees with adequate and varied resources. The report explores how companies should enhance their training for managers on workplace resources and benefits, as well as provide more treatment options for employees with ADHD. Akili has expanded options available with the launch of EndeavorOTC.\n\nThe Impact of Misconceptions about ADHD in the Workplace\n\nIn today’s workplace, misconceptions about ADHD abound.\n\n92% of employees believe that their colleagues hold misconceptions about ADHD, the most common of which is “people with ADHD just need to try harder”\n\n75% of employees with ADHD report experiencing increased micromanagement by supervisors relative to their peers\n\n56% believe their condition has specifically led them to being demoted, overlooked for promotions, or their job responsibilities being taken away\n\nThis figure jumps to 65% for parents with ADHD, highlighting the varied challenges of those with multiple home and work responsibilities\n\nBeyond Misconceptions: The Daily Realities of ADHD in the Workplace\n\nWhile misconceptions about ADHD serve to hinder employees with ADHD, the genuine challenges posed by ADHD symptoms also impact daily work experiences.\n\nNearly 2 in 3 (65%) of employees with ADHD say that accomplishing day-to-day work tasks while managing ADHD symptoms poses a moderate to significant challenge\n\n54% say they’re getting by, but would need more support to reach their full potential\n\n19% say they are barely getting by and really need additional support.\n\nThe most prevalent symptoms include being easily distracted or sidetracked, with 59% of employees with ADHD citing this as a primary concern, followed by 56% who report a lack of focus and engagement at work. These struggles are not limited to challenges with focusing attention, as 32% of employees report difficulty building relationships with colleagues. Gender nuances emerge in this context as well. Overall women reported more symptoms on average than men (4.6 symptoms vs. 4.0 symptoms).\n\nADHD takes a toll on employees in multiple ways, and 88% of employees with ADHD report that the stimulant shortage has further impacted their work. The vast majority of employees with ADHD (90%) describe errors, conflicts, or extra hours at work as a result of challenges managing their ADHD. Nearly half (46%) have missed a deadline or meeting. In addition, employees have duplicated work that had already been done (31%), sent incorrect information to a boss or client (31%) or missed work altogether (31%) as a result of challenges managing their ADHD.\n\nThis is consistent with previous research finding that employees with ADHD may lose an average of 29 days of productivity per year in the US as compared to their colleagues without ADHD.\n\nFurthermore, unmanaged ADHD symptoms can also be a reinforcing cycle, as 44% of employees with ADHD report that challenges managing their symptoms have caused them to feel unmotivated. Additionally 71% have reported it has led to them feeling anxious and 40% have reported it has led to them feeling depressed, further adding to the burden of the disorder.\n\nOn the other hand, nearly all employees with ADHD (98%) recognize that there are positive aspects of their ADHD that have helped them at work including increased creativity (51%), ability to think outside the box (49%), and higher levels of empathy (46%). Tapping into these strengths can be a powerful way to enhance workplace satisfaction, engagement and outcomes.\n\nFor managers, there appears to be a high level of familiarity with ADHD in general, with 83% of managers reporting that they are very or extremely familiar with ADHD. Of the managers surveyed, 21% report personally having ADHD. While this could be due to selection bias, it may also be that there are high levels of people with ADHD in management positions relative to the overall prevalence. Additionally, 74% of managers know someone at a current or previous job with ADHD and 37% directly supervised someone that they believed or confirmed had an ADHD diagnosis. While these numbers are encouraging, awareness is not the same as understanding how best to help.\n\nIn fact, 59% of managers report that they don’t feel completely prepared to appropriately respond if an employee tells them that they have ADHD. This gap between awareness and preparation underscores the need for more comprehensive training and education for managers.\n\nThe Value of Support\n\nFor employees diagnosed with ADHD, understanding and support from their employers and direct supervisors often take precedence over other workplace factors. 93% of employees with ADHD rate having a supervisor who knows how to support and work with them as more valuable than any office perk. When telling a supervisor about their ADHD, employees are looking for both practical support from supervisors on their working styles as well as additional workplace resources. For example, 55% of employees hope to gain acceptance of how their work style may differ from that of their colleagues and 24% are hoping for workplace resources.\n\nThe lack of training and resources has a direct impact on companies’ abilities to retain talent. For nearly half of employees with ADHD (45%), the challenges they experience in managing their symptoms at their current job have caused them to search for a new one or to consider doing so with nearly 1 in 10 (9%) already looking for a new position. This is especially true for younger generations – 62% of Gen Z and 57% of Millennials reported looking for, or planning to look for, a new job specifically because of challenges related to their ADHD (compared to 45% of Gen X and 26% of Boomers).\n\nRecommendations\n\nEmployees | For employees, there is a clearly expressed need for both acceptance of one’s own unique working style and additional tools and resources. Acceptance can start with a recognition of one’s own strengths and thinking about ways to shape your work tasks to fit your own learning style. This could involve identifying tasks that are energizing and that you are able to focus on and brainstorm ways to incorporate more of them into your day or intersperse them between more boring tasks. It may also involve tasks that involve higher stress, pressure or mental challenge (this can be a superpower!), novel or varied tasks, hands-on work, and/or topics of personal interest. As a next step, it can be helpful to develop a system of organization that complements your cognitive style, and to build your attentional control by engaging in specific cognitive activities designed to target and strengthen mental processes needed for attention.\n\nThe next set of strategies is based on communicating a need for support from others. When talking with a coworker or supervisor about having ADHD, think about your goal in telling them. Is it so others will better understand? For support? Figuring out how to better work together? Knowing the purpose will help guide the conversation. Based on your goal, share relevant information, whether it’s basic info or misconceptions about ADHD or more personally relevant experiences and strengths. Then you can discuss strategies and/or ask for support. The other person will likely ask questions, to think about how you’d like to respond. Ultimately, deciding whether or not to talk with coworkers or a supervisor about having ADHD is a personal decision. Guidance from a mental health professional or coach can be helpful in weighing the considerations and preparing for a conversation.\n\nManagers | Managers can help by creating an environment of psychological safety, where employees feel comfortable talking about their ADHD diagnosis and how they can best be supported. These conversations should not be forced on employees, but instead made clear that they are welcome without putting anyone on the spot. Furthermore, studies have shown that individuals with ADHD may find workplace accommodations to be helpful including reduction of auditory distractions, and managers who provide organization advice, clear delegation of tasks and clearly defined roles, or extra reminders about due dates. It’s important to remember that not all individuals want these accommodations, however. The most important thing is not to make assumptions and instead to talk to the individual in order to understand their particular needs.\n\nCompanies | In order to retain talent, minimize losses to productivity and create an environment where employees feel engaged and have the opportunity to thrive, there is a deep need for additional resources and training. Employers can provide educational materials about ADHD for all of their employees and can provide manager-specific trainings on topics such as “How to Create and Environment of Psychological Safety,” “How to Become Aware of (and Address) Our Own Biases” and “How to Provide Resources and Support for Employees with ADHD.” They can recognize the strengths of employees with ADHD diagnoses and support these employees in reaching their potential for the benefit of these employees and the company. Employers should also check benefits to make sure they are not arbitrarily excluding coverage for adults with ADHD, and consider additional benefits and resources in order to enable employees to work at their best.\n\nWith increased awareness of the gaps in supporting employees with ADHD in the workplace comes the urgent need to address these gaps through education, training and resources so as to unlock the potential of a neurodiverse workforce.\n\nTo learn more about a new kind of treatment option available for adults with ADHD:",

(Akili) pursuant to California Health and Safety Codes §§119400-119402 (Code) which requires pharmaceutical companies and certain medical device companies to make available their comprehensive compliance program and an annual written declaration of compliance with their compliance program.\n\nAkili is committed to conducting business in a manner which is built on trust and adherence to the highest ethical standards. Accordingly, we have built a compliance program that is based on the 2003 United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General publication “Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers.” Our compliance program is also informed by the AdvaMed “Code of Ethics on Interactions with U.S. Health Care Professionals,” as our company manufactures and produces a prescription digital therapeutic that has certain characteristics similar to a medical device. The AdvaMed Code is similar to the PhRMA Code but is tailored to serve the needs and interactions that a medical device company may have with a healthcare professional. Our compliance program is tailored to our size, organizational structure, available resources, and the nature of our business.\n\nAkili has set its annual dollar limit on gifts, promotional materials, or other items and activities that may be provided to a healthcare professional at $2,000. The dollar limit is a maximum only. This does not include fair market value payments that may be made for bona fide professional services including, but not limited to, serving on an advisory board, serving as a speaker, or performing other consulting services. This limit also does not include samples or free trials that may be provided or financial support for continuing medical education or other educational support.\n\nAkili declares that, to the best of our knowledge, and based on our understanding of the Code, we are in compliance with our compliance program and the Code.\n\nA written declaration of compliance may be obtained by calling 857-254-3367.\n\nOverview of Akili’s Compliance Program\n\nI. Written Policies and Procedures\n\nAkili has written policies and procedures that are the backbone of its compliance program. All employees are required to read and understand the policies and procedures.

Together, the Chief Compliance Officer and Compliance Committee oversee Akili’s compliance program.\n\nIII. Training and Education\n\nAkili conducts training and education on its compliance program for all employees. In addition to reading and acknowledging policies and procedures, employees periodically participate in live and web-based training. The compliance department also provides role-based training on an as needed basis.\n\nIV. Effective Lines of Communication\n\nAll employees are encouraged to raise concerns as they arise to either their manager, HR, compliance, or a member of senior management. Akili also maintains a third-party maintained hotline which allows employees to report anonymously.\n\nV. Monitoring and Auditing\n\nAkili’s compliance program includes regular monitoring and auditing activities as needed and at the direction of the Chief Compliance Officer and the Compliance Committee.\n\nVI. Disciplinary Guidelines\n\nAkili has disciplinary guidelines that have been published for all employees to read and understand. The Company ensures all disciplinary action, as it occurs, is in alignment with these guidelines.\n\nVII.

A lot of people are saying this. it gets really frustrating and annoying to keep steering for the boosts or obstacles. instead of engaging the audience it just angers it. it’s nothing new other than the new worlds. it’s boring. I know I only used this for 2 weeks but personally, it’s just not working. there needs to be something new! and the game is unfair. the animals move way too fast and a child’s reaction time isn’t that well developed. I know the game gets harder but *it’s not fair*. when you’re doing the same thing over and over again, it’s not fun anymore. and for this case, it NEEDS to be fun in order to “cure” ADHD. this game is not well thought out. us kids are impatient. it’s in our nature.",

This includes the game making your child do sharp turns back and forth, the game doesn’t have enough sensitivity to tilting your device unless you put it completely on its side which makes you turn too fast, the game runs you through tests to see if it should be harder, and if you pass the game gets too hard which makes the game to frustrating to play, if you don’t capture the “mystic creature” you feel like your not good enough, people have reported their child destroying devices because it’s frustrating, your child has to play for 5 days a week which would be every school day unless they do it on the weekend (which we will never happen) so it adds on to homework and it ware’s your child out, if you don’t have time to do it on school days your child has to do it on the weekend, if you can’t do it for at least 3 days of the week you don’t get in what is the minimum amount of time, and many other things.\n\nThere are some upsides too. On top of all of those bad things, if your child does play the minimum amount of minuets for 5 days a week and they continue to keep that up for most of the time you do start to see a change. My child doesn’t always get 5 days a week playing for 30 mins, but as long as she does about 4-3 days a week playing for the minimum amount of minuets once in a while I don’t see it affecting the positive affect if the game at all. The game has helped my daughter be able to hear me while she is hyper-focused on something she’s doing, she has been able to control her impulse better, she has been able to come back to what she’s supposed to be doing better, she doesn’t miss multi step directions as often, she’s been able to continue trying at a difficult task instead of giving up somewhat easier, and she is able to multi task better. \n\nSo basically, I do recommend this game because even if your child hates it and they still manage to get the minimum time in (or they occasionally get close to the minimum time in) the positive affects of the game will definitely show up in your child and they will also help your child. But I also don’t recommend it because of the many flaws that can stop your chiId from committing to playing and stop the positive affects from occurring. Really, getting the game and having your child manage to do it  is all personal to your schedule and your childs behavioral adaptations plus how their ADHD affects them. Getting the game is completely up to you but make sure you do some thinking about your child, schedule, and consider researching more about both good and bad opinions on this game before you buy it.",

I’ve taken a variety of medications and seen numerous things that are purported to help with ADHD. Here are some key takeaways\n1. This is a video game specifically focused on helping children age 8 to 12 with ADHD it requires supervision from a healthcare professional that’s why it’s FDA approved and needs a prescription. \n\n2. There is a commitment to use this 3 to 5 times a week for at least three months to see results. It does not replace medication it is adjunct therapy to be used in consideration with other treatment modalities. Basically that means the family and the healthcare professionals decide on other things that can help with ADHD this is never a standalone product.\n\n3. As a dualy licensed family nurse practitioner and psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner I find any tools that can help support family and improve the disease process is much better than just medication alone. Enclosing research different treatments read and understand with the product does and does not do before making some flippant and derogatory comments that makes you look uneducated and uninformed.\n\nThis product may not be for everyone but for those with adhd age 8 to 12 it is a new therapeutic  tool that is a game changer",

I have absolutely no idea how this got approved by the FDA. This made the ADHD WORSE for my kids!!! I paid $100 per month for each kid.

We have a regular iPad and while the large screen size is great for the graphics holding the thing and trying to steer for 25 minutes literally causes him tears as his arms start to hurt and that in turn affects his game play.\nNow we have to purchase a smaller iPad or use our phones (which he says is too small for the graphics) in order for him to continue to want to play. Additionally he is complaining that the story/purpose of the game is not very fun. It’s the same repetitive thing over and over. There seems to be insufficient incentive to want to advance to the next level. I haven’t been able to get him to play consecutively without nagging/badgering him. It’s just not fun enough",

      "# Would recommend, but also wouldn’t., 3 stars [(Ally Selvig, Apple App Store, 2022-04-14)](https://apple/8567372071)\nthere are many things that make this game problematic.\n\n First, the game is VERY critical to children and has made my daughter cry because she feels like she’s not good enough, which adds on to the main point of it being very difficult to play in many ways. This includes the game making your child do sharp turns back and forth, the game doesn’t have enough sensitivity to tilting your device unless you put it completely on its side which makes you turn too fast, the game runs you through tests to see if it should be harder, and if you pass the game gets too hard which makes the game to frustrating to play, if you don’t capture the “mystic creature” you feel like your not good enough, people have reported their child destroying devices because it’s frustrating, your child has to play for 5 days a week which would be every school day unless they do it on the weekend (which we will never happen) so it adds on to homework and it ware’s your child out, if you don’t have time to do it on school days your child has to do it on the weekend, if you can’t do it for at least 3 days of the week you don’t get in what is the minimum amount of time, and many other things.\n\nThere are some upsides too. On top of all of those bad things, if your child does play the minimum amount of minuets for 5 days a week and they continue to keep that up for most of the time you do start to see a change. My child doesn’t always get 5 days a week playing for 30 mins, but as long as she does about 4-3 days a week playing for the minimum amount of minuets once in a while I don’t see it affecting the positive affect if the game at all. The game has helped my daughter be able to hear me while she is hyper-focused on something she’s doing, she has been able to control her impulse better, she has been able to come back to what she’s supposed to be doing better, she doesn’t miss multi step directions as often, she’s been able to continue trying at a difficult task instead of giving up somewhat easier, and she is able to multi task better. \n\nSo basically, I do recommend this game because even if your child hates it and they still manage to get the minimum time in (or they occasionally get close to the minimum time in) the positive affects of the game will definitely show up in your child and they will also help your child. But I also don’t recommend it because of the many flaws that can stop your chiId from committing to playing and stop the positive affects from occurring. Really, getting the game and having your child manage to do it  is all personal to your schedule and your childs behavioral adaptations plus how their ADHD affects them. Getting the game is completely up to you but make sure you do some thinking about your child, schedule, and consider researching more about both good and bad opinions on this game before you buy it.",
      "# Feedback, 1 stars [(hfdhdhgv Funchal Leonardo's, Apple App Store, 2022-02-17)](https://apple/8366771880)\nHonestly I think that the game should have a few more items that the child can change such as sensitivity and audio settings for the reason the game is having the child do hairpin turns and is having to flip the device therefore preventing them from seeing the items in which they need to tap and the audio settings for the ability to use music if that helps them focus as well as scoring less harshly because the child in a skill test can make less that six mistakes in targeting or else that have to do it again.

And please allow parents to set how long they should use the game. Also, it would be helpful if the child had to play the game for a certain number of minutes before they were able to access the character store. I was under the impression my daughter was doing the full 25 minutes every time because I am setting a timer downstairs, however it looks like she was only spending part of the time doing the game and the rest doing the store. Also the parent app is not very helpful at all. I would like to see real data on where she struggling and how she’s improving over time. What is shown currently is not helping me as a parent at all.

      "# Amazing! Game Changer!!!!!, 5 stars [(Bubba Wilber Williams, Apple App Store, 2021-06-24)](https://apple/7503010246)\nI am a family nurse practitioner who has had ADHD since I was age 5. I’ve taken a variety of medications and seen numerous things that are purported to help with ADHD. Here are some key takeaways\n1. This is a video game specifically focused on helping children age 8 to 12 with ADHD it requires supervision from a healthcare professional that’s why it’s FDA approved and needs a prescription. \n\n2. There is a commitment to use this 3 to 5 times a week for at least three months to see results. It does not replace medication it is adjunct therapy to be used in consideration with other treatment modalities. Basically that means the family and the healthcare professionals decide on other things that can help with ADHD this is never a standalone product.\n\n3. As a dualy licensed family nurse practitioner and psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner I find any tools that can help support family and improve the disease process is much better than just medication alone. Enclosing research different treatments read and understand with the product does and does not do before making some flippant and derogatory comments that makes you look uneducated and uninformed.\n\nThis product may not be for everyone but for those with adhd age 8 to 12 it is a new therapeutic  tool that is a game changer",

ADHD does not make someone dumb ... although because society views certain people to be a certain way because boomers even though you’re tested for your IQ and you get 140 twice because you have ADHD they still hold you back and treat you like you’re stupid...I do not approve this game because instead of trying to better the world you’re trying to make money very obvious bunch other people make their apps easily accessible without paying $450 I don’t care how much it helps it’s a rip off for the amount of work you put in",

          "pros": "The first thing that drew me to the Akili was the mission….the products that Akili is developing will change the face of therapeutically active digital medicine.  It’s fascinating work to be a small part of.  One of the reasons I plan on staying for a while is the people who work here.  It would be difficult to find a more collaborative, positive, inclusive group of people, who genuinely love the work they do.  They support each other, regardless of the benefit to themselves or their specific skillset.  It’s also fun.  \r\n\r\nThe company goes out of it's way to offer above average benefits, compensation and employee appreciation with a creative bent. It is evident that a lot of work has gone into this.  How many times in your career can you say you’ve looked forward to coming into work every day?  For me, that is a motivating factor.  Companies talk about their “culture.”  This company works at building an environment that is setting us up for success.  This is a reflection on the carefully chosen leadership and the teams that they've built.  While all different in background and personality, this is a group of individuals that compliment one another in their intellectual abilities and personality traits.  Even the most dynamic people in this company are humble, no matter their level.  Leadership here is largely inclusive and goes above and beyond to offer support, to build up employees, helping them along on their career path.  I believe this is why the company is able to retain its people.    \r\n\r\nAkili is a continuous learning environment.  There's opportunity to learn every single day that we’re here.  There is no getting bored or feeling stagnated here.  There is opportunity to grow in your career and we are supported in continued education, networking, and clear set goals.  We have recently implemented a program to give substantive feedback more frequently. If you excel at Akili, there is career growth opportunity and stability.",

It would be difficult to find a more collaborative, positive, inclusive group of people, who genuinely love the work they do.  They support each other, regardless of the benefit to themselves or their specific skillset.  It’s also fun.  \r\n\r\nThe company goes out of it's way to offer above average benefits, compensation and employee appreciation with a creative bent. It is evident that a lot of work has gone into this.  How many times in your career can you say you’ve looked forward to coming into work every day?  For me, that is a motivating factor.  Companies talk about their “culture.”  This company works at building an environment that is setting us up for success.  This is a reflection on the carefully chosen leadership and the teams that they've built.  While all different in background and personality, this is a group of individuals that compliment one another in their intellectual abilities and personality traits.  Even the most dynamic people in this company are humble, no matter their level.  Leadership here is largely inclusive and goes above and beyond to offer support, to build up employees, helping them along on their career path.  I believe this is why the company is able to retain its people.    \r\n\r\nAkili is a continuous learning environment.  There's opportunity to learn every single day that we’re here.  There is no getting bored or feeling stagnated here.  There is opportunity to grow in your career and we are supported in continued education, networking, and clear set goals.  We have recently implemented a program to give substantive feedback more frequently. If you excel at Akili, there is career growth opportunity and stability.",

      "# [Digital therapeutics firm Akili to sell for $34M by Elise Reuter, Nick Paul Taylor on 2024-05-30](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/)\nDive Brief:\n\nAkili, a company that makes a video game treatment for ADHD, will sell to Virtual Therapeutics for about $34 million, according to a Wednesday regulatory filing.\n\nThe two companies will merge into a larger digital health firm, with Akili operating as a subsidiary of Virtual Therapeutics.\n\nAkili received Food and Drug Administration clearance in 2020 for a prescription game to improve attention in children with ADHD. But, after rounds of layoffs, the company shifted away from the prescription model last year and began exploring strategic alternatives in April.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAkili was one of a few companies that sought to develop prescription apps, called digital therapeutics, that have received the FDA’s blessing and would be covered by insurers. Boston-based Akili achieved the first milestone when it received de novo clearance for its game for children to improve ADHD symptoms, called EndeavorRx. However, it struggled to find payers willing to cover the product.\n\nAkili went public through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company in 2022. It received a delisting notice from Nasdaq in October, and its shares have traded below $1 since the start of 2024.\n\nThe company cut nearly a third of its staff in January 2023 and went through another round of layoffs later that year. In September, Akili announced it would restructure its business to no longer focus on prescriptions. Akili started selling an over-the-counter version of its ADHD treatment for adults, thanks to pandemic flexibilities on certain digital health products, and planned to seek FDA clearance to sell both the adult and pediatric versions over the counter.\n\nThe over-the-counter product brought more money to Akili than the prescription version, but the company’s expenses still surpassed its earnings.\n\nIn 2023, the company brought in $1.7 million in revenue, with $1.2 million from EndeavorOTC and $523,000 from EndeavorRx. Akili reported a $59.5 million net loss last year.\n\nIn April, Akili cut 46% of its workforce, including axing its marketing and medical affairs teams, and began looking into strategic alternatives. It also struck an agreement with Japanese pharmaceutical company Shionogi to forgive a $5 million debt obligation and pay $10.5 million upfront for a version of EndeavorRx sold in Japan in exchange for eliminating future royalty and milestone payments.\n\nVirtual Therapeutics will make a cash tender offer of 43 cents per share to buy Akili. The Kirkland, Washington-based company makes virtual reality products for mental wellness in the workplace.",
      "# [Akili to lay off 46% of its staff, explore strategic options amid sluggish sales by Mario Aguilar on 2024-04-30](https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/30/akili-interactive-digital-therapeutics-firm-announce-layoffs-restructuring/)\nAkili Interactive on Tuesday announced it will lay off 46% of its staff and evaluate strategic alternatives amid sluggish sales of its video game treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The announcement comes ahead of the company’s first-quarter earnings release on May 14.\n\nAkili’s hunt for options follows dismal outcomes for other digital therapeutics companies that have thrown in the towel after failing to build sustainable businesses. Earlier this year, Better Therapeutics, developer of an FDA-cleared app for the treatment of type 2 diabetes shut down operations. And almost exactly a year ago, Pear Therapeutics sold off its assets at bankruptcy auction.\n\nadvertisement",

      "# [Akili Announces Positive Results from Shionogi’s Phase 3 Clinical Trial of Localized Version of Akili’s EndeavorRx® for Pediatric ADHD Patients in Japan on 2024-02-26](https://www.biospace.com/akili-announces-positive-results-from-shionogi-s-phase-3-clinical-trial-of-localized-version-of-akili-s-endeavorrx-for-pediatric-adhd-patients-in-japan)\nBOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Akili Interactive Labs, Inc. (Nasdaq: AKLI), a leading digital medicine company, today announced that its Japanese partner Shionogi & Co., Ltd. has submitted Akili’s digital therapeutic SDT-001 for marketing approval with the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare. SDT-001 is the Japanese, localized version of Akili’s AKL-T01 (marketed as EndeavorRx® in the United States), which has previously been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the world’s first prescription digital therapeutic for improving attentional functioning in pediatric ADHD patients aged 8 to 17.\n\n“The latest Japanese clinical trial of our patented, clinically proven technology is an important milestone for many reasons,” said Dr. Scott Kollins, Chief Medical Officer at Akili. “It not only further validates the efficacy and safety of EndeavorRx, it also moves us and our international partner SHIONOGI a step closer to making the product available in Japan. And if approved in Japan, it will provide an effective and safe option in a country where some front line pharmaceutical therapies are not as widely available to pediatric patients with ADHD.”\n\nThe submission for marketing approval in Japan is based on the favorable results of the Phase 3 clinical trial conducted by SHIONOGI in the country. The trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SDT-001 in 164 pediatric ADHD patients aged 6 to 17 who received conventional treatments such as environmental adjustments and psychosocial therapies. The SDT-001 group, undergoing approximately 25 minutes of treatment once daily for 6 weeks (1 cycle), demonstrated statistically significant improvements in the change from baseline in the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) Inattention score compared to the control group (continuing conventional treatments) at the 6-week mark (p < 0.05), achieving the primary endpoint of the trial. Moreover, statistically significant improvements were observed in the change from baseline in the total ADHD-RS-IV score and the hyperactivity/impulsivity score at the 6-week mark in the SDT-001 group compared to the control group (p < 0.05). No safety concerns or serious adverse events related to SDT-001 were observed. Furthermore, symptom improvements were sustained even after two cycles of SDT-001 use, with no safety concerns noted.\n\nAbout Shionogi & Co. Ltd\n\nSHIONOGI is committed to realizing the SHIONOGI Group Vision of “Building Innovation Platforms to Shape the Future of Healthcare” by transforming into a “Healthcare as a Service (HaaS)” company. While enhancing our strengths as a research-based pharmaceutical company, we aim to provide diverse treatment options beyond medicinal products, including collaborations with external partners, to contribute to improving the quality of life for patients and their families.\n\nAbout EndeavorRx and EndeavorOTC\n\nAkili’s suite of cognitive treatment products for ADHD includes EndeavorRx and EndeavorOTC®. EndeavorRx is indicated to improve attention function as measured by computer-based testing in children ages 8 to 17 years old with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD, who have a demonstrated attention issue. Patients who engage with EndeavorRx demonstrate improvements in a digitally assessed measure Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA®) of sustained and selective attention and may not display benefits in typical behavioral symptoms, such as hyperactivity. EndeavorRx should be considered for use as part of a therapeutic program that may include clinician-directed therapy, medication and/or educational programs, which further address symptoms of the disorder. EndeavorRx is available by prescription only. It is not intended to be used as a stand-alone therapeutic and is not a substitution for a child’s medication. The most common side effect observed in children in EndeavorRx’s clinical trials was a feeling of frustration, as the game can be quite challenging at times. No serious adverse events were associated with its use.

      "# [Virtual Therapeutics, Akili Interactive Strike Definitive Merger Agreement Seeking to Improve Mental Health Through Immersive Video Games by Don Tracy, Associate Editor on 2024-05-31](https://www.pharmexec.com/view/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-strike-definitive-merger-agreement-seeking-to-improve-mental-health-through-immersive-video-games)\nVirtual Therapeutics and Akili, Inc. announced that they have agreed to terms on a definitive merger agreement, aiming to establish a digital health company that creates engaging and immersive games to improve mental health. Under terms of the merger, Akili will now work as a wholly owned company of Virtual Therapeutics, Akili shareholders will receive $0.4340 per share of common stock in cash, representing a 4% premium to the closing stock price.1\n\n“In today’s global mental health crisis, patients deserve access to clinically validated solutions that address their specific needs. We have been able to advance multiple solutions on our platform since founding Virtual Therapeutics, and we look forward to taking a significant step forward through this merger,” said Dan Elenbaas, co-founder, CEO, Virtual Therapeutics, in a press release. “The team at Akili has been successful in applying clinical and scientific rigor to bring new products forward, and we believe their expertise will complement our efforts. Together, we can build a company that brings these behavioral services to as many patients as possible—regardless of where they are or barriers that exist for them today.”\n\nIn February, Akili announced promising results from a Phase III clinical trial conducted by its partner Shionogi & Co. Ltd, for STD-001, a localized version of EndeavorRx, Akili’s prescription digital therapeutic indicated to improve attentional functioning in pediatric patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). EndeavorRx was previously authorized by the FDA for patients aged 8 to 17 years with ADHD.\n\nAs part of the trial, 164 pediatric patients with ADHD aged 6 to 17 years who received environmental adjustments and psychosocial therapies were evaluated for 25 minutes a day over six weeks. According to the company, the group displayed major improvements in the change from baseline in the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) Inattention score compared to the control group (continuing conventional treatments) after six weeks.2\n\n“The latest Japanese clinical trial of our patented, clinically proven technology is an important milestone for many reasons,” said Scott Kollins, chief medical officer, Akili, in a press release. “It not only further validates the efficacy and safety of EndeavorRx, it also moves us and our international partner SHIONOGI a step closer to making the product available in Japan. And if approved in Japan, it will provide an effective and safe option in a country where some front-line pharmaceutical therapies are not as widely available to pediatric patients with ADHD.”\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than one in five people live with a mental illness in the United States, with one in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression. There are several causes of mental illness, such as trauma or a history of abuse, use of drugs and alcohol, chemical imbalances in the brain, and feelings of loneliness or isolation.3\n\n“Akili ran a thorough strategic process, and we believe that this transaction represents Akili’s commitment to delivering value to the Akili stockholder,” said Matt Franklin, CEO, Akili, in the press release. “Virtual Therapeutics has been built by a team with decades of success in the gaming industry and elected to focus their expertise to help solve the growing mental health crisis. Combining our proven track record developing and deploying rigorously validated mobile digital therapeutics with Virtual Therapeutics’ robust portfolio of VR-based mental health solutions and gaming expertise, we aim to create a compelling platform to address mental health needs across several high-impact indications.”\n\nReferences\n\n1.

      "# [What to Know About EndeavorRX, the Video Game to Treat ADHD by Jessica Rendall on 2023-12-24](https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/what-to-know-about-endeavor-the-video-game-to-treat-adhd/)\nWe often attribute our waning attention spans to the never-ending barrage of notifications and screen time, but one video game company, Akili Interactive, has created a reality where the opposite is true. The mobile game Endeavor is the only video game cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for ADHD for children in 2020. This week, the company announced that the FDA has extended its label to include older kids and teens up to age 17, meaning all kids aged 8 and older can get a prescription for the video game.\n\nAnd while it doesn't have the same official clearance from the FDA, there's also an off-label version of the game for adults.\n\nBut does it work? Adults are addressing that question -- and reviewing the entertainment value of the game itself -- on Reddit. One redditor described EndeavorOTC as a \"boring Mario Kart\" that causes your mind to wander in a way that makes you \"practice focusing and multitasking.\"\n\nMany patients are still struggling to find ADHD treatment, as the US continues to climb out of a pandemic-era drug shortage potentially made worse by an increase in demand for stimulants like Adderall. For people interested in looking into alternative treatments or complementing activities to improve their attention or focus, trying a video game may be a reasonable next step.\n\nHow it works\n\nEndeavorRX is a 25-minute mobile game meant to be used five times a week for four consecutive weeks. It's meant to train or work your brain in a way that improves your focus or attention through daily exercises.\n\nPrescription version for kids and teens\n\nEndeavor says it uses \"sensory stimuli and simultaneous motor challenges\" that target the attention-centered parts of your brain. In the prescription version for children, the goal of the game is to navigate your character through obstacles while collecting targets. As your attention and performance improves, the game gets a little harder. Parents can monitor their child's progress on the game through EndeavorRx Insight, a companion app.\n\nPrior to its clearance as a treatment by the FDA, a trial survey found that 73% of children reported an improvement in their attention using EndeavorRX, compared to 50% of those who used the control.\n\nTo do a five-minute demo of EndeavorRX, you can download the app for iOS or Android and select the demo option.\n\nOff-label version for adults\n\nThe adult version is the same concept as the children's version but with an adult interface, according to Akili. It forces you to \"target and navigate,\" but it gives you a \"focus score\" instead of someone else monitoring your progress through the companion app. The focus score is a measure of how quickly and accurately you can complete a task despite distractions.\n\nAccording to Akili, improvements in adult attention were significantly larger than they were found to be in children when the game was tested and cleared by the FDA.\n\nFor \"best results,\" the company recommends a six-week period playing the game, then a week's break, followed by another six-week period.\n\nHow to get a prescription and how much it costs\n\nA health care provider will write a prescription and then a special pharmacy will send you a code. EndeavorRX costs $99 for a 30-day prescription, and you can use your FSA or HSA dollars on it.\n\nEndeavorOTC costs $25 per month, or $130 per year. This off-label version doesn't require a prescription.\n\nWho might not be a good fit for an ADHD video game\n\nAs ADDitude reported, people with photo-sensitive epilepsy, color blindness or certain physical limitations may not be able to use it.\n\nBut compared to the laundry list of side effects that may come with ADHD medications, some of which are stimulants, side effects of playing the video game are, understandably, much milder. Five percent of people in the EndeavorOTC trial reported a side effect from playing the game, most commonly nausea or headache, according to Akili.",
      "# [Virtual Therapeutics completes acquisition of Akili by Sean Whooley on 2024-07-02](https://www.massdevice.com/virtual-therapeutics-acquires-akili/)\nVirtual Therapeutics announced today that it completed the tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Akili (Nasdaq:AKLI).\n\nThe company initially commenced its tender offer at a price of $0.4340 per share on June 3. It expired at one minute after 11:59 p.m. EDT on July 1. As of the expiration date, nearly 70 million shares (88.2% of Akili’s outstanding shares) were validly tendered.\n\nFollowing the completion of this offer, Virtual Therapeutics plans for its Alpha Merger Sub subsidiary to merge with Akili today, July 2. As a result, Akili will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Virtual Therapeutics.\n\nAkili develops the EndeavorRx video game for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The prescription treatment is delivered through a video game experience as a way to improve attention function as measured by computer-based testing.\n\nVirtual Therapeutics develops digital health solutions for mental health and mental fitness, leveraging game development expertise. It combines modern gameplay mechanisms with proven therapeutic techniques.\n\n“The completion of this acquisition provides a foundation for us to build a leading digital health company that is capable of bringing new behavioral services to as many patients as possible,” said Dan Elenbaas, co-founder and CEO of Virtual Therapeutics. “We look forward to leveraging Akili’s expertise and strengths as we embark on this next stage of growth for Virtual Therapeutics.”\n\nHow Akili got to this point\n\nThe company hit some snags over the past year or so, reflecting a potential trend in the digital therapeutics space. Fellow DTX companies also struggled, with Better Therapeutics ceasing operations in March, then selling its assets in May. Pear Therapeutics similarly scaled down operations after filing bankruptcy last year.\n\nAkili, meanwhile, shifted toward a non-prescription business model with over-the-counter offerings last year, reducing its workforce by approximately 40%. That included the elimination of the company’s field sales force and market access team.",
      "# [Shionogi takes Akili’s ADHD digital therapy to Japan on 2024-02-27](https://pharmaphorum.com/news/shionogi-takes-akilis-adhd-digital-therapy-japan)\nDigital health company Akili is on the brink of its first major expansion beyond the US, partnering with Shionogi to file a localised version of its attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) therapy for approval in Japan.\n\nThe game-based digital therapeutic (DTx) has been filed for approval with Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW) as a prescription treatment for ADHD based on a clinical trial, carried out in Japanese children aged six to 17, which showed statistically significant improvements in attention and hyperactivity/impulsivity.\n\nAkili notes that Japan could be an important market for the EndeavorRx spinoff, called SDT-001, as access is restricted to many of the drugs used to treat ADHD in the US. That includes most medicines based on stimulants, such as amphetamine salts, although non-stimulant drugs like methylphenidate are available.\n\n“If approved in Japan, it will provide an effective and safe option in a country where some front-line pharmaceutical therapies are not as widely available to paediatric patients with ADHD,” said Dr Scott Kollins, Akili’s chief medical officer.\n\nThe prevalence of ADHD has been estimated to be lower in Japan than in North America, at around 0.4% versus 5.3% according to one study, although that could be down to variations in diagnosis and there is some evidence that case numbers have been rising.\n\nThe Japanese trial was carried out by Shionogi and was a phase 3 study, enrolling 164 children with ADHD who were being treated with conventional treatments, including environmental adjustments and psychosocial therapies.\n\nThose randomised to 25-minute daily use of SDT-001 for six weeks saw statistically significant improvements in the change from baseline in the ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) Inattention score compared to a control group at the end of that period, the study’s primary endpoint, said Akili.\n\nThat was accompanied by significant improvements in the change from baseline in the total ADHD-RS-IV score and the hyperactivity/impulsivity score at the same time point, and the benefit was sustained after a second six-week treatment cycle, according to the company.\n\nShionogi is an established player in the Japanese ADHD market with Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate), one of the only stimulant drugs approved for use by the MHLW- although, since 2020, it has been subject to a 30-day prescription limit.\n\nIt partnered with Akili in 2019 to bring DTx for ADHD and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to the Japanese market in a deal that included an upfront payment of $10 million and up to $105 million in development and commercial milestones.\n\nThe move into Japan comes as Akili has modified its business strategy in the US, with the launch of an over-the-counter version of EndeavorRx, aimed at treating ADHD in adults, in a move that recognised the challenges in building a sustainable prescription DTx business.",

Gazzaley also has written more than 180 scientific articles and delivered more than 700 talks around the world.\n\nGazzaley will discuss his extensive, groundbreaking career during a Sonoma Speaker Series event on Monday, June 17, from 7 to 8:30 p.m. at Hanna Center in Sonoma. He will chat with David Bolling, a member of the Sonoma Speaker Series Board of Directors.\n\n“I will share an overview of my last 20 years of neuroscience research directed at both understanding the neural basis of attention/distraction and how it changes across the life span, as well as how technology can be used to improve cognition, specifically attention,” he said.\n\nGazzaley is perhaps best known for his work as the founder and executive director of Neuroscape, a translational neuroscience center at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) that combines technology and scientific research to better assess and optimize brain function in healthy and impaired individuals.\n\nIn May 2010, he delivered a talk in Boston in which he shared new data showing that older adults who played his first video game creation, Neuroracer, improved their attention. He later collaborated with Eddie Martucci, then the vice president of PureTech Health, and Matt Omernick, then the executive art director from LucasArts, to create Akili Interactive, which provides engaging game experiences, or “digital medicines,” for people living with cognitive impairment.\n\nAfter a decade of effort, Akili Interactive’s EndeavorRx, a therapeutic game created by Gazzaley and based on Neuroracer technology, was cleared by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) as a prescription treatment for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It not only was the first FDA-cleared digital treatment for the disorder, but also the first video game ever approved by the FDA to treat any medical condition.\n\nGazzaley regards the development and validation of interactive experiences, delivered as video games to improve brain functions, as his main achievement.\n\n“We have now shown in dozens of research trials that the games we developed at UCSF can have a meaningful and sustainable impact on cognition in diverse populations of individuals,” he said.\n\nHe is now building upon this work at Akili Interactive.\n\n“The current and next stage of my research program is to integrate digitally delivered experiences with innovations in sensory immersive technologies, multimodal physiological recordings, noninvasive electrical brain stimulation, artificial intelligence and psychedelics to enhance cognition,” Gazzaley said.\n\nHe is now serving in this 19th year at UCSF, where he is the David Dolby Distinguished Professor of Neurology, Physiology and Psychiatry.\n\nGazzaley also is the co-founder and chief scientist at JAZZ Venture Partners, a venture capital firm that invests in experiential technologies that combine new digital technology platforms with recent advances in neuroscience to create entirely new ways to improve human performance.\n\nJAZZ Venture Partners aims to unlock human potential in health, mind-body wellness, sports, entertainment, enterprise and accelerated learning and training.\n\nGazzaley wrote and hosted the PBS special “The Distracted Mind with Dr. Adam Gazzaley,” and co-authored (with Larry Rosen) the book, “ The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World,” winner of the 2017 Association of American Publishers’ Professional and Scholarly Excellence Award (PROSE Award) in biomedicine and neuroscience.\n\nHe is the recipient of the 2015 Society for Neuroscience Science Educator Award and 2020 Global Gaming Citizen Honor and was included in Newsweek's 2021 Inaugural list of America’s Greatest Disruptors, a group of 50 “visionaries, innovators and pioneers who are transforming the world through technology.”\n\nGazzaley graduated from Bronx High School of Science in New York City in 1986 and went on to receive a bachelor’s degree in biochemistry from Binghampton University in New York in 1990, and a medical degree and a doctorate from Mount Sinai School of Medicine (now The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai) in 1998.\n\nHe completed a residency in neurology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in 2002 and postdoctoral research training in cognitive neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley in 2005.\n\nHis wife, Jo Gazzaley, is a developer and project leader at Neuroscape. They live with their daughters in San Francisco.\n\nThe event on June 17 at Hanna Center is sold out, but if some buyers do not attend, tickets, which cost $40 each, will be available at the door. The doors will open at 6:15 p.m. and there will be open seating. Beer, wine and sparkling water will be available for purchase by cash or credit card.",

      "# [Study by digital therapeutics firm highlights breadth of ADHD workplace challenges by Fee Sheet Shane on 2024-03-08](https://www.adhdnews.co/p/akili-adhd-workplace-study)\nThis article is 1965 words long. It should take approximately 9 minutes to read.\n\nA recent study conducted by ADHD technology treatment company Akili Interactive has shed new light on the challenges facing employees with ADHD across the US corporate system.\n\nThere are an estimated 11 million adults with an ADHD diagnosis in the US alone — and the number of other adults who are as yet undiagnosed but who display ADHD traits and behaviors could be significantly more than that again.\n\nAnd given the scale of those numbers, any study which takes a closer look at common everyday experiences warrants some attention.\n\nIn collaboration with Arlington, Virginia-headquartered market research and polling firm Wakefield Research, Akili Interactive — a Japanese software firm with a growing US footprint through its EndeavorRx and EndeavorOTC ADHD treatments — has published a comprehensive survey of the day to day reality for American workers and their managers.\n\nAnd the results show something has to change.\n\nADHD News is a reader- and institution-supported publication with a mission to become a primary resource of trusted information about ADHD news, research and treatments. Please consider subscribing today as an individual or through your institution.\n\nADHD workplace study methodology\n\nThe study was split across two population groups in online polls that took place in August and September 2023.\n\nThe first group surveyed was made up of 500 US currently employed US adults, all of whom had previously been formally diagnosed with ADHD.\n\nIn terms of demographics, that group’s participants had a 50-50 split between male and female.\n\nMore than 9 in 10 workers believe their colleagues have misconceptions about ADHD, such as “people with ADHD just need to try harder”\n\nA separate but related survey, the Akili Managers Survey, also surveyed 500 US Managers, 40% of whom were female.\n\nThe study participants were invited to answer a series of questions related to ADHD and attitudes towards ADHD in the workplace.\n\nThe two study groups gave some fascinating insights into the perspectives of employees and managers in American companies and organizations.\n\nThe findings were published in a paper titled “Build a Better Workplace for Those with ADHD”, which illuminates often-overlooked hurdles encountered by individuals navigating their careers with ADHD and highlights critical gaps between support, resources and understanding.\n\nInsights from the study\n\nHeadline figures included:\n\n87% of employees with ADHD believe their career has been directly negatively impacted\n\n97% feel they would accomplish more if they could better manage their symptoms\n\nMore than 4 in 5 managers (81%) admitted to feeling ill-equipped to address the needs of employees with an ADHD diagnosis.\n\nA remarkable 40% of US managers felt it was preferable for an employee to NOT reveal their ADHD diagnosis\n\nDespite the common misconception that ADHD is “overtreated”, only 13% of workers with ADHD are receiving professional treatment\n\n2 in 3 employees with ADHD (65%) say accomplishing day-to-day work tasks while managing ADHD symptoms is a moderate to significant challenge\n\nAlmost all employees (98%) recognize positive aspects of their ADHD that have helped them at work\n\nOne of the most persistent challenges facing employees, the study highlighted, was the belief that their colleagues hold important misconceptions about ADHD.\n\nMore than 9 in 10 believe this to be the case, with the most common one being “people with ADHD just need to try harder”.\n\nOther areas highlighted in the study data show the enduring career challenges faced by those with ADHD.\n\nMore than a third of respondents say they believe their condition saw them being overlooked for promotions (37%) and more than 1 in 4 said they were stripped of core job responsibilities as a result of their ADHD.\n\nSuch experiences are almost certain to compound exponentially over the course of a career to have far-reaching detrimental consequences for employees with ADHD.\n\nThe question “Have challenges managing your ADHD at work ever resulted in any of the following” and the options offered will likely bring back some traumatic memories of a varying degree for anyone with ADHD traits who has spent any prolonged periods of time in a corporate environment.\n\nThe options for that question included:\n\nMissed a deadline or meeting\n\nHad to work late or on the weekend to catch up\n\nMissed a social event to finish work\n\nDuplicated work that had already been done\n\nSent incorrect information to a boss or client\n\nMissed work\n\nInterestingly, just 3% of those polled — or approximately 15 employees out of the 500 surveyed — said they had not experienced any of the above.\n\nGiven the broad nature of those events, of course, there is an argument that asking any broad set of 500 corporate employees picked at random may have led to a similar result.\n\nThat said, the specificity of the question — have challenges managing your ADHD at work resulted in the following — shows that the issue of juggling an ADHD mind and its differences with the standard corporate environment is a very real one.\n\nIn terms of treatment, 95% of employees polled felt constrained by the limited array of options available to them — a situation which is likely worsened due to the ongoing global shortages of ADHD medications.\n\nTaken in the collective, the research paints a stark and sobering picture of the workplace challenges faced by employees with ADHD — and it’s not hard to extrapolate those experiences into obvious downstream impacts on productivity, performance, recognition, fulfillment and earnings potential.\n\nAnd overall, the study will almost certainly increase the enduring suspicion that those with ADHD and ADHD-like traits might be expected to last a relatively short time in typical corporate environments before opting to pursue a career away from the conventional 9-to-5.\n\nThe researchers’ innovation agenda\n\nThe study was led by Dr Scott Kollins, Akili Interactive’s Chief Medical Officer and heralded as one of America’s leading ADHD authorities.\n\nDr Kollins’s research has spanned a wide gamut of issues related to ADHD, leading to the publication of almost 200 scientific papers in peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n\nHaving spent more than 20 years as Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences at the Duke University School of Medicine, he took up the role of Chief Medical Officer at Akili in the summer of 2022.\n\nWith that 95% figure highlighting the dearth of treatment options, the study by Dr Kollins does indicate that further innovation in treatments is required to better serve the needs of employees with ADHD.\n\nThis assertion might owe plenty to the ongoing ADHD medication crisis, which has seen severe shortages of drugs such as Vyvanse, Ritalin and Adderall around the world for much of the past year.\n\nBut it’s fair to say that the identified need for innovation in ADHD treatment also tallies closely with the corporate mission of Akili Interactive, the digital medicine company which has brought the EndeavorRx and EndeavorOTC video game treatments to the US market.\n\nRelated story\n\nEndeavorRx is a prescription-only video game-based digital therapeutic which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US as an ADHD treatment for children aged 8 to 17, while the adults-focused EndeavorOTC game app, which showed highly promising results in clinical trials without negative outcomes, is currently available for as little as $10 per month on an annual subscription.\n\nIn addition to the EndeavorRx and EndeavorOTC developments, recently published promising new trial data as part of an application to get a gaming treatment for children similar to EndeavorRx approved in Japan.\n\nDespite all this research, development and innovation — all of which is explicitly relevant to the ADHD in the Workplace study — the ADHD in the workplace paper was admirably subtle in this direction when published on the Akili website.\n\nIn a detailed section under the heading “Recommendations”, the paper offered three sets of recommendations — one for employees, one for managers and one for organizations — and only included a couple of understated text links to the website of EndeavorOTC before the unavoidable call-to-action button at the bottom.\n\nSome notable highlights among those recommendations were:\n\nFor employees, the research encouraged…\n\n“When talking with a coworker or supervisor about having ADHD, think about your goal in telling them. Is it so others will better understand? For support? Figuring out how to better work together? Knowing the purpose will help guide the conversation.”\n\n… illustrating, to this reader at least, the importance of having intention over getting attention.\n\nAlso for employees, the report said that “it can be helpful to develop a system of organization that complements your cognitive style”, a suggestion that will probably be music to all ADHD-er ears — at least before the allure of developing that system is replaced by the allure of developing a different one!\n\nFor managers, among other things the researchers said that “the most important thing is not to make assumptions and instead to talk to the individual in order to understand their particular needs”.\n\nPerhaps the most pressing recommendation — it might even be called a warning — was reserved for companies.\n\nThe report stated (emphasis ours):\n\nIn order to retain talent, minimize losses to productivity and create an environment where employees feel engaged and have the opportunity to thrive, there is a deep need for additional resources and training.\n\nEmployers can provide educational materials about ADHD for all of their employees and can provide manager-specific trainings on topics such as “How to Create and Environment of Psychological Safety,” “How to Become Aware of (and Address) Our Own Biases” and “How to Provide Resources and Support for Employees with ADHD.”\n\nThey can recognize the strengths of employees with ADHD diagnoses and support these employees in reaching their potential for the benefit of these employees and the company.\n\nEmployers should also check benefits to make sure they are not arbitrarily excluding coverage for adults with ADHD, and consider additional benefits and resources in order to enable employees to work at their best.\n\nAll of this feels necessary, even critical, given the lasting negative impact of productivity losses, falling morale and the talent exodus that results when workplace culture and processes prove deficient.\n\nNevertheless, it must be acknowledged that the challenge facing corporate management in addressing wave upon wave of new support requirements — while at the same time feeling acute political (often external) pressures to commit to diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and on top of all that trying to make the decisions required to run a company profitably in an era of increasing threats across everything from AI to climate change to offshoring — is clearly a significant one.\n\nCheck out the full ADHD workplace study\n\nCheck out the full study from the Akili Interactive website here\n\nSubscribe to ADHD News now\n\nADHD News is a reader- and institution-supported publication with a mission to become a primary resource of trusted information about ADHD news, research and treatments.

      "# [World Evidence for Innovation by Dr. Caitlin Stamatis, Director of Medical Affairs, Dr. Caitlin Stamatis, Director of Medical Affairs on 2024-04-11](https://www.endeavorotc.com/blog/beyond-clinical-trials-how-endeavorotc-uses-real-world-evidence-for-innovation/)\nEndeavorOTC is a game-based ADHD treatment that is clinically designed to treat cognitive impairment at the source and improve focus in adults. It’s a digital therapeutic built with the same technology behind EndeavorRx, the world’s first FDA-authorized prescription video game treatment for pediatric ADHD.1\n\nOne reason our products are labeled as digital therapeutics–rather than just wellness apps–is our commitment to scientific research. Our treatments have been tested in seven clinical trials in over 900 patients with ADHD, with findings published in leading academic journals like The Lancet and npj Digital Medicine.\n\nThrough these trials, we demonstrated that EndeavorRx and EndeavorOTC lead to improvements in attention and ADHD symptoms, and these studies were also central to the FDA’s decision to authorize EndeavorRx as a medical treatment. But what these trials weren’t able to do is demonstrate how the treatment impacts patients’ daily lives on a continual basis, which is why we began real-world evidence studies. Here are some differences between clinical trials and real-world evidence studies—which you can be part of!\n\nThe lowdown on clinical trials\n\nClinical trials, which are focused on determining whether a new treatment leads to improvements in a specific group, are central to medical research. Clinical trials are tightly controlled research studies, meaning that they often have strict rules for who is included and procedures to ensure participants are actively engaging in the treatment being studied.\n\nThe benefit of this type of design? By removing potential noise from the experiment, clinical trials make it easier to draw comparisons between a group that received EndeavorOTC and a group that received another treatment, producing high-quality data. At the same time, there are always questions about how well any of the observed benefits will translate to real-world improvement for real-world patients.\n\nOftentimes, medical product developers will stop their research after a clinical trial has shown their treatment is effective, which can leave lots of open questions. For example, how long do the effects of treatment last in the real world? Will the treatment be effective for someone who has additional diagnoses besides the one studied in the clinical trial? The way to answer these types of questions is to gather real-world data on a treatment, which can be done with a research registry study.\n\nEnter: the research registry study\n\nWe continue to study how EndeavorOTC is helping patients in the real world by creating a paid research registry study, which focuses on understanding day-to-day improvements in the lives of EndeavorOTC users.\n\nSo what exactly is a registry study? A registry study uses observational methods to collect and store data from users of a product to evaluate outcomes over time.2 In other words, once someone begins using a commercially-available treatment (in our case EndeavorOTC), they are offered the option to participate in paid research, which involves completing brief monthly surveys about their symptoms and experiences. Our research team anonymizes and aggregates these data so we can better evaluate how engagement with Endeavor products helps to treat ADHD symptoms and improve daily functioning—outcomes like being able to find your keys and wallet, or being better able to plan and prioritize tasks.\n\nWhat does the EndeavorOTC paid registry study involve?\n\nParticipation lasts 6-12 months and involves the following steps:\n\nSubscribe to EndeavorOTC\n\nShortly after you subscribe to EndeavorOTC, you will receive an email inviting you to learn more about the registry research study. You’ll be taken to a page where you can review the study details, and—if you’re interested—submit a valid email address.\n\nCheck your inbox\n\nWe’ll send an email to the address you provided with unique details for you to enroll in the registry study. You’ll be given a link to create an account on the study platform and electronically sign the informed consent document.\n\nComplete some surveys\n\nYou’ll next receive an email with a link to complete a set of baseline surveys asking about your symptoms, treatment history, and other areas.\n\nKeep an eye out for our emails\n\nEvery one to three months, up to one year, you’ll be asked to complete follow-up surveys asking about similar topics, so we can understand how your symptoms are changing over time as you use EndeavorOTC.\n\nCurious about research oversight and privacy? Know that we are serious about data privacy. This registry study has been reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board, and registered with clinicaltrials.gov.\n\nInterested in learning more about the study or joining?

(Nasdaq: AKLI) announced another workforce reduction, terminating nearly half of its remaining employees.\n\nThe layoffs, which amount to 46% of Akili’s workforce, will eliminate the company’s marketing and medical affairs teams, according to publicly available documents. The restructuring, which is estimated to cost between $2.3 and $2.8 million including severance costs, is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThis is the company’s third round of significant layoffs in less than a year and a half.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September 2023, Akili announced it would lay off 40% of its staff, primarily in its field sales force and market access teams.\n\nIn January 2023, the company made plans to lay off 46 employees, equivalent to 30% of its workforce.\n\nThe two 2023 layoffs were driven by the economic environment and the company’s strategic shift towards a user subscription-based model, moving away from its previous prescription-focused approach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAkili did not respond to Behavioral Health Business’s request for comment by the time of publication.\n\nThe news of the most recent workforce cut coincided with the announcement of another strategic shift.\n\nAkili revealed that its board would evaluate several strategic options and alternatives in an attempt to maximize shareholder value.\n\n“There can be no assurance that this process will result in Akili pursuing a transaction or that any transaction, if pursued, will be completed on attractive terms, if at all,” the filing read.\n\nThe company also announced an amendment to its deal with Japan-based global pharmaceutical company Shionogi & Co, which includes Shionogi’s forgiveness of a $5 million long-term debt obligation, an upfront payment of $10.5 million and the potential for an additional $4.5 million.\n\nBoston, Massachusetts-based Akili’s digital therapeutic product EndeavorRx, which treats pediatric ADHD, received FDA clearance in 2020. The product operated through a video game experience and was designed to improve attention function in children ages 8 to 12.\n\nThe company offers a version of the therapeutic designed for adults, called EndeavorOTC, which also employs a gamified approach and is currently under FDA review.\n\nAkili will make its products available for purchase and will continue to support current users of its products.\n\nAkili is not the first digital therapeutics company to suffer financially. Pear Therapeutics, the first company to receive an FDA de novo clearance for a digital therapeutic, filed for bankruptcy in April 2023.\n\nPear’s demise likely cooled investor interest in digital therapeutics, according to the latest Pitchbook digital health report. Still, there was “a decent share of transactions” in the digital therapeutics space in 2023, the report’s authors wrote.\n\nNotably, digital therapeutics company BehaVR merged with Fern Health, a virtual chronic pain management company.\n\nPitchbook analysts anticipate an uptick in consolidations in digital therapeutics companies in 2024. In line with this prediction, digital health care company Dario, which offers behavioral health care, acquired technology company Twill in February.\n\nOther players in the digital therapeutics space are still hoping to find success, despite Pear’s failure and Akili’s struggles.",
      "# [ADHD in Women by Jessica Flannery, PhD, Jessica Flannery on 2023-11-01](https://www.endeavorotc.com/blog/adhd-in-women/)\nAttentional deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects individuals across sexes and genders. Despite the name of the disorder and the common depictions from movies or predispositions of what it looks like to have ADHD, there are a few subtypes of ADHD: a) predominantly inattentive, b) predominantly hyperactive, or c) combined type (inattentive and hyperactive). That means that you can meet criteria for the disorder without hyperactivity and impulsivity (or without inattention).\n\nWhile ADHD has been historically associated with higher prominence in males, recent literature sheds light on the unique challenges and manifestations of ADHD in women. This overview aims to provide a science-based perspective on ADHD in women, exploring its prevalence, underdiagnosis, and the impact it can have on different aspects of women’s lives across age.\n\nNotably, while we will explore some of the literature of sex differences in the disorder and presentation, we will also highlight where some of these differences are not neurobiological, but further exacerbated due to societal norms and gender biases in diagnostic bias and culturally-deemed “appropriate” behavior for different genders. To bring this idea into the public focus, Akili, the brand behind EndeavorOTC, hosted a panel featuring four incredible women and their experiences with ADHD, both personal and professional. Watch the full panel video here.\n\nADHD Symptoms in Men vs Women\n\nScientific studies suggest that ADHD manifests differently in men and women, leading to underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis in women. While men with ADHD often exhibit hyperactivity and externalizing behaviors, women with ADHD tend to exhibit more inattentiveness, which can be less visible, but equally disruptive to their daily lives. Check out this article on 4 ways that ADHD symptoms can differ for women.\n\nIs ADHD More Common in Men or Women?\n\nExamining the prevalence of ADHD in men versus women is a complex topic. While research indicates higher prevalence rates of ADHD in males, sex differences in ADHD diagnosis changes across age. The largest discrepancy in ADHD prevalence occurs in childhood and shrinks to nearly equivalent levels by mid-adulthood. Check out this article on “Debunking ADHD stereotypes: it’s not just a boy thing” to explore the reasons for the changing prevalence rates for women across the lifespan.\n\nIs ADHD Different for Men and Women?\n\nPrevalence rates of ADHD differ across men and women, but does that mean there are biological reasons for this discrepancy? Check out this article on “is ADHD really different for men and women” to learn more about what the science tells us about biological differences and similarities, as well as the implications of these differences on treatment.\n\nMisdiagnosis and Underdiagnosis of ADHD in Women\n\nOne of the most critical aspects of ADHD in women is the significant underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis. Women are more likely to be diagnosed with anxiety or depression, diagnosed later in life, and show a different symptom presentation of ADHD than men. Check out this article for an in-depth look at the factors contributing to the underidentification of ADHD in women, including the impact on women’s wellbeing.\n\nADHD in Older Women",

Designed to enhance attention function, it targets men and women with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD, addressing specific attention challenges.\n\nEndeavorOTC, available now in the U.S., can be accessed on the Apple App Store for iOS and the Google Play Store for Android devices.\n\nThis FDA clearance of EndeavorOTC underscores its status as a scientifically and clinically validated digital therapy for adult ADHD. We are proud to lead the way in digital medicine,” said Matt Franklin, CEO of Akili.\n\nThe FDA clearance is backed by a clinical study involving 221 adults with verified inattentive or combined-type ADHD who used AKL-T01 for six weeks. Results showed that 83% of participants reported improved focus, as measured by the TOVAⓇ attentional control score. Additionally, 72.5% reported enhanced quality of life according to the validated Adult ADHD Quality of Life Scale (AAQoL), and 45.8% achieved clinically meaningful improvement.\n\nParticipants also demonstrated significant improvement in clinician-rated ADHD symptoms, measured by the ADHD-RS inattention subscale and total scale scores. Notably, 32.7% of participants showed at least a 30% reduction in their ADHD-RS total score.\n\nThis achievement marks Akili’s second digital ADHD therapeutic to gain FDA authorization, reflecting their commitment to innovative digital health solutions. The company extends its gratitude to the patients whose participation was crucial in achieving this milestone.\n\nMore on Akili"
