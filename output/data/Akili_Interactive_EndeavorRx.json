  "summary_markdown": "# About Akili Interactive\n\nAkili Interactive, founded on January 1, 2011, is a digital therapeutics company that integrates neuroscience with technology and video game entertainment to develop treatments for cognitive disorders. The company is particularly known for its innovative approach to treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) through video game-based therapies. Akili's flagship product, EndeavorRx, is a prescription digital therapeutic designed to improve attention function in children aged 8-12 with ADHD. The company also offers EndeavorOTC, a treatment option for adults with ADHD, expanding its reach to a broader audience [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/akili).\n\nAkili primarily operates in the B2C market, serving children with ADHD and their families, as well as adults with ADHD. Their products are distributed through licensed healthcare providers. The company has received significant attention since gaining FDA clearance for EndeavorRx in 2020 and went public in 2022 with a valuation of approximately $1 billion [(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)](https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/virtual-therapeutics-acquire-akili-video-games-adhd/).\n\nThe company has undergone significant changes, including a recent merger with Virtual Therapeutics, which is expected to enhance its capabilities in creating immersive digital health solutions. This strategic move follows Akili's decision to wind down its existing commercial operations and focus on licensing agreements, particularly with Japanese pharmaceutical company Shionogi [(Tracy, PharmExec, 2024)](https://www.pharmexec.com/view/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-strike-definitive-merger-agreement-seeking-to-improve-mental-health-through-immersive-video-games).\n\nAkili has raised a total of $270 million in funding, with notable investments including $110 million and $50 million rounds in May 2021 [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/akili). The company is supported by investment firms such as Baillie Gifford, CLSA, and Polaris Partners.\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nMatt Franklin serves as the CEO of Akili Interactive. He has emphasized the strategic importance of the merger with Virtual Therapeutics, highlighting the potential to expand the company's reach in the digital health sector. Franklin's leadership reflects a commitment to addressing the growing mental health crisis through innovative digital solutions [(Tracy, PharmExec, 2024)](https://www.pharmexec.com/view/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-strike-definitive-merger-agreement-seeking-to-improve-mental-health-through-immersive-video-games).\n\n# News\n\n## Merger with Virtual Therapeutics\n\nIn 2024, Akili Interactive announced a merger with Virtual Therapeutics, a move expected to enhance its capabilities in digital health solutions. The merger will allow Akili to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Virtual Therapeutics, with shareholders receiving $34 million in cash [(Tracy, PharmExec, 2024)](https://www.pharmexec.com/view/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-strike-definitive-merger-agreement-seeking-to-improve-mental-health-through-immersive-video-games). This decision follows Akili's strategy to focus on licensing agreements and partnerships, particularly with Shionogi [(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)](https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/virtual-therapeutics-acquire-akili-video-games-adhd/).\n\n## Financial and Operational Changes\n\nAkili Interactive has faced financial challenges, leading to layoffs and a strategic shift in operations. In April 2024, the company announced plans to lay off 46% of its staff and explore strategic options amid sluggish sales [(Mario Aguilar, 2024-04-30)](https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/30/akili-interactive-digital-therapeutics-firm-announce-layoffs-restructuring/). The merger with Virtual Therapeutics is part of Akili's efforts to stabilize and grow its business in the competitive digital therapeutics market.\n\n## Market Position and Future Prospects\n\nThe digital therapeutics market is projected to grow significantly, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 20-25% from 2023 to 2030 [(Ratakonda, Artixio, 2024)](https://www.artixio.com/post/digital-therapeutics-combining-technology-for-better-health-outcomes). Akili's focus on cognitive disorders positions it well within this expanding market, especially as the demand for innovative ADHD treatments rises. The merger with Virtual Therapeutics is expected to enhance Akili's product offerings and market reach, potentially leading to new developments in digital health solutions for mental health [(Tracy, PharmExec, 2024)](https://www.pharmexec.com/view/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-strike-definitive-merger-agreement-seeking-to-improve-mental-health-through-immersive-video-games).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAkili Interactive is at a pivotal moment in its evolution, transitioning through a merger that aims to strengthen its position in the digital therapeutics market. With a proven product in EndeavorRx and expanding applications for ADHD treatment across various age groups, Akili is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for digital health solutions. The company's strategic focus on partnerships and licensing agreements will be crucial as it navigates the complexities of the healthcare landscape and seeks to deliver value to its stakeholders.",

      "# [EndeavorRx — Akili Interactive](https://www.akiliinteractive.com/endeavorrx)\nEndeavorRx Indications, Safety and Cautions\n\nIndications:\n\nEndeavorRx is a digital therapeutic indicated to improve attention function as measured by computer-based testing in children ages 8-12 years old with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD, who have a demonstrated attention issue. Patients who engage with EndeavorRx demonstrate improvements in a digitally assessed measure, Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA®), of sustained and selective attention and may not display benefits in typical behavioral symptoms, such as hyperactivity. EndeavorRx should be considered for use as part of a therapeutic program that may include clinician-directed therapy, medication, and/or educational programs, which further address symptoms of the disorder.\n\nSafety:\n\nOf 538 participants using EndeavorRx, 50 participants (9.3%) experienced treatment-related adverse events (probable, likely), and three participants experienced treatment-related adverse events with the digital control, in studies where a control was used. EndeavorRx associated adverse events included frustration (6.1%), headache (1.3%), dizziness (0.6%), emotional reaction (0.4%), nausea (0.4%), and aggression (0.2%). There were no serious adverse events. All adverse events were generally transient. Only 3 events led to device discontinuation, and no subject reported lasting or irreversible effects after discontinuation.\n\nCautions:\n\nRx only: Federal law restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a physician. EndeavorRx should only be used by the patient for whom the prescription was written. For medical questions, please contact your child’s healthcare provider. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, please dial 911. EndeavorRx is not intended to be used as a stand-alone therapeutic and is not a substitution for your child’s medication.\n\nIf your child experiences frustration, emotional reaction, dizziness, nausea, headache, eye-strain, or joint pain while playing EndeavorRx pause the treatment. If the problem persists contact your child’s healthcare provider. If your child experiences a seizure stop the treatment and contact your child’s healthcare provider.\n\nEndeavorRx may not be appropriate for patients with photo-sensitive epilepsy, color blindness, or physical limitations that restrict use of a mobile device; parents should consult with their child’s healthcare provider.\n\nPlease follow all of your mobile device manufacturer’s instructions for the safe operation of your mobile device. For example, this may include appropriate volume settings, proper battery charging, not operating the device if damaged, and proper device disposal. Contact your mobile device manufacturer for any questions or concerns that pertain to your device.",

      "# [ADHD in The Workplace — Akili Interactive](https://www.akiliinteractive.com/workplacesurvey)\nEmployees with ADHD are navigating their careers with intention, but a lack of adequate support. To cultivate an inclusive and thriving work environment, companies must transcend conventional approaches and provide better guidance for managers, and more comprehensive support for employees. These insights emerge from the new ADHD in the Workplace Study conducted by Akili and Wakefield Research, shedding light on the need and opportunity for ADHD accommodations at work to maximize the potential of a neurodiverse workforce.\n\nInformation was collected from US employed adults¹: 500 US employed adults with ADHD and 500 US managers (with or without ADHD), to understand the everyday challenges and experiences of those with ADHD at work. The survey covered the impact of impairment, disclosure to employers, experiences of stigma, manager misconceptions, treatment options, and more.\n\nThe research revealed that employees with ADHD face compounding challenges at work that can sidetrack career goals and take a toll on mental health.\n\n87% of employees with ADHD report experiencing a negative impact of ADHD on their career\n\n97% feel they would be capable of accomplishing more if they could better manage their symptoms.\n\n95% feel limited by the number of treatment options available to them.\n\nEmployees with ADHD are seeking a more nuanced understanding and awareness from their supervisors of their strengths and needs for additional support, but managers feel unequipped to fully provide that support. Namely, 81% of managers report that they don’t feel completely prepared to appropriately address employee needs if an employee discloses an ADHD diagnosis.\n\nIf companies don’t take action to support their employees with ADHD, they run the risk of driving these employees away, with additional impacts on engagement and productivity. In light of the ongoing stimulant medication shortage (see FDA-DEA letter 2023), it has become even more urgent to support employees with adequate and varied resources. The report explores how companies should enhance their training for managers on workplace resources and benefits, as well as provide more treatment options for employees with ADHD. Akili has expanded options available with the launch of EndeavorOTC.\n\nThe Impact of Misconceptions about ADHD in the Workplace\n\nIn today’s workplace, misconceptions about ADHD abound.\n\n92% of employees believe that their colleagues hold misconceptions about ADHD, the most common of which is “people with ADHD just need to try harder”\n\n75% of employees with ADHD report experiencing increased micromanagement by supervisors relative to their peers\n\n56% believe their condition has specifically led them to being demoted, overlooked for promotions, or their job responsibilities being taken away\n\nThis figure jumps to 65% for parents with ADHD, highlighting the varied challenges of those with multiple home and work responsibilities\n\nBeyond Misconceptions: The Daily Realities of ADHD in the Workplace\n\nWhile misconceptions about ADHD serve to hinder employees with ADHD, the genuine challenges posed by ADHD symptoms also impact daily work experiences.\n\nNearly 2 in 3 (65%) of employees with ADHD say that accomplishing day-to-day work tasks while managing ADHD symptoms poses a moderate to significant challenge\n\n54% say they’re getting by, but would need more support to reach their full potential\n\n19% say they are barely getting by and really need additional support.\n\nThe most prevalent symptoms include being easily distracted or sidetracked, with 59% of employees with ADHD citing this as a primary concern, followed by 56% who report a lack of focus and engagement at work. These struggles are not limited to challenges with focusing attention, as 32% of employees report difficulty building relationships with colleagues. Gender nuances emerge in this context as well. Overall women reported more symptoms on average than men (4.6 symptoms vs. 4.0 symptoms).\n\nADHD takes a toll on employees in multiple ways, and 88% of employees with ADHD report that the stimulant shortage has further impacted their work. The vast majority of employees with ADHD (90%) describe errors, conflicts, or extra hours at work as a result of challenges managing their ADHD. Nearly half (46%) have missed a deadline or meeting. In addition, employees have duplicated work that had already been done (31%), sent incorrect information to a boss or client (31%) or missed work altogether (31%) as a result of challenges managing their ADHD.\n\nThis is consistent with previous research finding that employees with ADHD may lose an average of 29 days of productivity per year in the US as compared to their colleagues without ADHD.\n\nFurthermore, unmanaged ADHD symptoms can also be a reinforcing cycle, as 44% of employees with ADHD report that challenges managing their symptoms have caused them to feel unmotivated. Additionally 71% have reported it has led to them feeling anxious and 40% have reported it has led to them feeling depressed, further adding to the burden of the disorder.\n\nOn the other hand, nearly all employees with ADHD (98%) recognize that there are positive aspects of their ADHD that have helped them at work including increased creativity (51%), ability to think outside the box (49%), and higher levels of empathy (46%). Tapping into these strengths can be a powerful way to enhance workplace satisfaction, engagement and outcomes.\n\nFor managers, there appears to be a high level of familiarity with ADHD in general, with 83% of managers reporting that they are very or extremely familiar with ADHD. Of the managers surveyed, 21% report personally having ADHD. While this could be due to selection bias, it may also be that there are high levels of people with ADHD in management positions relative to the overall prevalence. Additionally, 74% of managers know someone at a current or previous job with ADHD and 37% directly supervised someone that they believed or confirmed had an ADHD diagnosis. While these numbers are encouraging, awareness is not the same as understanding how best to help.\n\nIn fact, 59% of managers report that they don’t feel completely prepared to appropriately respond if an employee tells them that they have ADHD. This gap between awareness and preparation underscores the need for more comprehensive training and education for managers.\n\nThe Value of Support\n\nFor employees diagnosed with ADHD, understanding and support from their employers and direct supervisors often take precedence over other workplace factors. 93% of employees with ADHD rate having a supervisor who knows how to support and work with them as more valuable than any office perk. When telling a supervisor about their ADHD, employees are looking for both practical support from supervisors on their working styles as well as additional workplace resources. For example, 55% of employees hope to gain acceptance of how their work style may differ from that of their colleagues and 24% are hoping for workplace resources.\n\nThe lack of training and resources has a direct impact on companies’ abilities to retain talent. For nearly half of employees with ADHD (45%), the challenges they experience in managing their symptoms at their current job have caused them to search for a new one or to consider doing so with nearly 1 in 10 (9%) already looking for a new position. This is especially true for younger generations – 62% of Gen Z and 57% of Millennials reported looking for, or planning to look for, a new job specifically because of challenges related to their ADHD (compared to 45% of Gen X and 26% of Boomers).\n\nRecommendations\n\nEmployees | For employees, there is a clearly expressed need for both acceptance of one’s own unique working style and additional tools and resources. Acceptance can start with a recognition of one’s own strengths and thinking about ways to shape your work tasks to fit your own learning style. This could involve identifying tasks that are energizing and that you are able to focus on and brainstorm ways to incorporate more of them into your day or intersperse them between more boring tasks. It may also involve tasks that involve higher stress, pressure or mental challenge (this can be a superpower!), novel or varied tasks, hands-on work, and/or topics of personal interest. As a next step, it can be helpful to develop a system of organization that complements your cognitive style, and to build your attentional control by engaging in specific cognitive activities designed to target and strengthen mental processes needed for attention.\n\nThe next set of strategies is based on communicating a need for support from others. When talking with a coworker or supervisor about having ADHD, think about your goal in telling them. Is it so others will better understand? For support? Figuring out how to better work together? Knowing the purpose will help guide the conversation. Based on your goal, share relevant information, whether it’s basic info or misconceptions about ADHD or more personally relevant experiences and strengths. Then you can discuss strategies and/or ask for support. The other person will likely ask questions, to think about how you’d like to respond. Ultimately, deciding whether or not to talk with coworkers or a supervisor about having ADHD is a personal decision. Guidance from a mental health professional or coach can be helpful in weighing the considerations and preparing for a conversation.\n\nManagers | Managers can help by creating an environment of psychological safety, where employees feel comfortable talking about their ADHD diagnosis and how they can best be supported. These conversations should not be forced on employees, but instead made clear that they are welcome without putting anyone on the spot. Furthermore, studies have shown that individuals with ADHD may find workplace accommodations to be helpful including reduction of auditory distractions, and managers who provide organization advice, clear delegation of tasks and clearly defined roles, or extra reminders about due dates. It’s important to remember that not all individuals want these accommodations, however. The most important thing is not to make assumptions and instead to talk to the individual in order to understand their particular needs.\n\nCompanies | In order to retain talent, minimize losses to productivity and create an environment where employees feel engaged and have the opportunity to thrive, there is a deep need for additional resources and training. Employers can provide educational materials about ADHD for all of their employees and can provide manager-specific trainings on topics such as “How to Create and Environment of Psychological Safety,” “How to Become Aware of (and Address) Our Own Biases” and “How to Provide Resources and Support for Employees with ADHD.” They can recognize the strengths of employees with ADHD diagnoses and support these employees in reaching their potential for the benefit of these employees and the company. Employers should also check benefits to make sure they are not arbitrarily excluding coverage for adults with ADHD, and consider additional benefits and resources in order to enable employees to work at their best.\n\nWith increased awareness of the gaps in supporting employees with ADHD in the workplace comes the urgent need to address these gaps through education, training and resources so as to unlock the potential of a neurodiverse workforce.\n\nTo learn more about a new kind of treatment option available for adults with ADHD:",

This includes the game making your child do sharp turns back and forth, the game doesn’t have enough sensitivity to tilting your device unless you put it completely on its side which makes you turn too fast, the game runs you through tests to see if it should be harder, and if you pass the game gets too hard which makes the game to frustrating to play, if you don’t capture the “mystic creature” you feel like your not good enough, people have reported their child destroying devices because it’s frustrating, your child has to play for 5 days a week which would be every school day unless they do it on the weekend (which we will never happen) so it adds on to homework and it ware’s your child out, if you don’t have time to do it on school days your child has to do it on the weekend, if you can’t do it for at least 3 days of the week you don’t get in what is the minimum amount of time, and many other things.\n\nThere are some upsides too. On top of all of those bad things, if your child does play the minimum amount of minuets for 5 days a week and they continue to keep that up for most of the time you do start to see a change. My child doesn’t always get 5 days a week playing for 30 mins, but as long as she does about 4-3 days a week playing for the minimum amount of minuets once in a while I don’t see it affecting the positive affect if the game at all. The game has helped my daughter be able to hear me while she is hyper-focused on something she’s doing, she has been able to control her impulse better, she has been able to come back to what she’s supposed to be doing better, she doesn’t miss multi step directions as often, she’s been able to continue trying at a difficult task instead of giving up somewhat easier, and she is able to multi task better. \n\nSo basically, I do recommend this game because even if your child hates it and they still manage to get the minimum time in (or they occasionally get close to the minimum time in) the positive affects of the game will definitely show up in your child and they will also help your child. But I also don’t recommend it because of the many flaws that can stop your chiId from committing to playing and stop the positive affects from occurring. Really, getting the game and having your child manage to do it  is all personal to your schedule and your childs behavioral adaptations plus how their ADHD affects them. Getting the game is completely up to you but make sure you do some thinking about your child, schedule, and consider researching more about both good and bad opinions on this game before you buy it.",

I’ve taken a variety of medications and seen numerous things that are purported to help with ADHD. Here are some key takeaways\n1. This is a video game specifically focused on helping children age 8 to 12 with ADHD it requires supervision from a healthcare professional that’s why it’s FDA approved and needs a prescription. \n\n2. There is a commitment to use this 3 to 5 times a week for at least three months to see results. It does not replace medication it is adjunct therapy to be used in consideration with other treatment modalities. Basically that means the family and the healthcare professionals decide on other things that can help with ADHD this is never a standalone product.\n\n3. As a dualy licensed family nurse practitioner and psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner I find any tools that can help support family and improve the disease process is much better than just medication alone. Enclosing research different treatments read and understand with the product does and does not do before making some flippant and derogatory comments that makes you look uneducated and uninformed.\n\nThis product may not be for everyone but for those with adhd age 8 to 12 it is a new therapeutic  tool that is a game changer",

Now his game is stuck due to a glitch and he said that he is happy. We are still trying to get technical support after missing 3 days of playing, and to me this is unacceptable after making us go through all the hoops to get this prescription and charging us $99 for a month.

We have a regular iPad and while the large screen size is great for the graphics holding the thing and trying to steer for 25 minutes literally causes him tears as his arms start to hurt and that in turn affects his game play.\nNow we have to purchase a smaller iPad or use our phones (which he says is too small for the graphics) in order for him to continue to want to play. Additionally he is complaining that the story/purpose of the game is not very fun. It’s the same repetitive thing over and over. There seems to be insufficient incentive to want to advance to the next level. I haven’t been able to get him to play consecutively without nagging/badgering him. It’s just not fun enough",

Sometime I still can’t focus but I am enjoying the game overall but I think there’s just something missing in the game also I like the skins they have but I think there should also be an option to create your own avatar like the hair style color accessories the cloths and all that stuff I would totally recommend this to someone with adhd such as myself and I think this game is amazing! :D",

      "# Would recommend, but also wouldn’t., 3 stars [(Ally Selvig, Apple App Store, 2022-04-14)](https://apple/8567372071)\nthere are many things that make this game problematic.\n\n First, the game is VERY critical to children and has made my daughter cry because she feels like she’s not good enough, which adds on to the main point of it being very difficult to play in many ways. This includes the game making your child do sharp turns back and forth, the game doesn’t have enough sensitivity to tilting your device unless you put it completely on its side which makes you turn too fast, the game runs you through tests to see if it should be harder, and if you pass the game gets too hard which makes the game to frustrating to play, if you don’t capture the “mystic creature” you feel like your not good enough, people have reported their child destroying devices because it’s frustrating, your child has to play for 5 days a week which would be every school day unless they do it on the weekend (which we will never happen) so it adds on to homework and it ware’s your child out, if you don’t have time to do it on school days your child has to do it on the weekend, if you can’t do it for at least 3 days of the week you don’t get in what is the minimum amount of time, and many other things.\n\nThere are some upsides too. On top of all of those bad things, if your child does play the minimum amount of minuets for 5 days a week and they continue to keep that up for most of the time you do start to see a change. My child doesn’t always get 5 days a week playing for 30 mins, but as long as she does about 4-3 days a week playing for the minimum amount of minuets once in a while I don’t see it affecting the positive affect if the game at all. The game has helped my daughter be able to hear me while she is hyper-focused on something she’s doing, she has been able to control her impulse better, she has been able to come back to what she’s supposed to be doing better, she doesn’t miss multi step directions as often, she’s been able to continue trying at a difficult task instead of giving up somewhat easier, and she is able to multi task better. \n\nSo basically, I do recommend this game because even if your child hates it and they still manage to get the minimum time in (or they occasionally get close to the minimum time in) the positive affects of the game will definitely show up in your child and they will also help your child. But I also don’t recommend it because of the many flaws that can stop your chiId from committing to playing and stop the positive affects from occurring. Really, getting the game and having your child manage to do it  is all personal to your schedule and your childs behavioral adaptations plus how their ADHD affects them. Getting the game is completely up to you but make sure you do some thinking about your child, schedule, and consider researching more about both good and bad opinions on this game before you buy it.",
      "# Feedback, 1 stars [(hfdhdhgv Funchal Leonardo's, Apple App Store, 2022-02-17)](https://apple/8366771880)\nHonestly I think that the game should have a few more items that the child can change such as sensitivity and audio settings for the reason the game is having the child do hairpin turns and is having to flip the device therefore preventing them from seeing the items in which they need to tap and the audio settings for the ability to use music if that helps them focus as well as scoring less harshly because the child in a skill test can make less that six mistakes in targeting or else that have to do it again.

And please allow parents to set how long they should use the game. Also, it would be helpful if the child had to play the game for a certain number of minutes before they were able to access the character store. I was under the impression my daughter was doing the full 25 minutes every time because I am setting a timer downstairs, however it looks like she was only spending part of the time doing the game and the rest doing the store. Also the parent app is not very helpful at all. I would like to see real data on where she struggling and how she’s improving over time. What is shown currently is not helping me as a parent at all.

I’ve taken a variety of medications and seen numerous things that are purported to help with ADHD. Here are some key takeaways\n1. This is a video game specifically focused on helping children age 8 to 12 with ADHD it requires supervision from a healthcare professional that’s why it’s FDA approved and needs a prescription. \n\n2. There is a commitment to use this 3 to 5 times a week for at least three months to see results. It does not replace medication it is adjunct therapy to be used in consideration with other treatment modalities. Basically that means the family and the healthcare professionals decide on other things that can help with ADHD this is never a standalone product.\n\n3. As a dualy licensed family nurse practitioner and psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner I find any tools that can help support family and improve the disease process is much better than just medication alone. Enclosing research different treatments read and understand with the product does and does not do before making some flippant and derogatory comments that makes you look uneducated and uninformed.\n\nThis product may not be for everyone but for those with adhd age 8 to 12 it is a new therapeutic  tool that is a game changer",

I paid $100 per month for each kid. We did it two months, as recommended, and my kids' behavior was AWFUL. Their impulsivity SKYROCKETED, as did forgetfulness. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.",

We have a regular iPad and while the large screen size is great for the graphics holding the thing and trying to steer for 25 minutes literally causes him tears as his arms start to hurt and that in turn affects his game play.\nNow we have to purchase a smaller iPad or use our phones (which he says is too small for the graphics) in order for him to continue to want to play. Additionally he is complaining that the story/purpose of the game is not very fun. It’s the same repetitive thing over and over. There seems to be insufficient incentive to want to advance to the next level. I haven’t been able to get him to play consecutively without nagging/badgering him. It’s just not fun enough",

          "content": "there are many things that make this game problematic.\n\n First, the game is VERY critical to children and has made my daughter cry because she feels like she’s not good enough, which adds on to the main point of it being very difficult to play in many ways. This includes the game making your child do sharp turns back and forth, the game doesn’t have enough sensitivity to tilting your device unless you put it completely on its side which makes you turn too fast, the game runs you through tests to see if it should be harder, and if you pass the game gets too hard which makes the game to frustrating to play, if you don’t capture the “mystic creature” you feel like your not good enough, people have reported their child destroying devices because it’s frustrating, your child has to play for 5 days a week which would be every school day unless they do it on the weekend (which we will never happen) so it adds on to homework and it ware’s your child out, if you don’t have time to do it on school days your child has to do it on the weekend, if you can’t do it for at least 3 days of the week you don’t get in what is the minimum amount of time, and many other things.\n\nThere are some upsides too. On top of all of those bad things, if your child does play the minimum amount of minuets for 5 days a week and they continue to keep that up for most of the time you do start to see a change. My child doesn’t always get 5 days a week playing for 30 mins, but as long as she does about 4-3 days a week playing for the minimum amount of minuets once in a while I don’t see it affecting the positive affect if the game at all. The game has helped my daughter be able to hear me while she is hyper-focused on something she’s doing, she has been able to control her impulse better, she has been able to come back to what she’s supposed to be doing better, she doesn’t miss multi step directions as often, she’s been able to continue trying at a difficult task instead of giving up somewhat easier, and she is able to multi task better. \n\nSo basically, I do recommend this game because even if your child hates it and they still manage to get the minimum time in (or they occasionally get close to the minimum time in) the positive affects of the game will definitely show up in your child and they will also help your child. But I also don’t recommend it because of the many flaws that can stop your chiId from committing to playing and stop the positive affects from occurring. Really, getting the game and having your child manage to do it  is all personal to your schedule and your childs behavioral adaptations plus how their ADHD affects them. Getting the game is completely up to you but make sure you do some thinking about your child, schedule, and consider researching more about both good and bad opinions on this game before you buy it.",

I was under the impression my daughter was doing the full 25 minutes every time because I am setting a timer downstairs, however it looks like she was only spending part of the time doing the game and the rest doing the store. Also the parent app is not very helpful at all. I would like to see real data on where she struggling and how she’s improving over time. What is shown currently is not helping me as a parent at all.

Here are some key takeaways\n1. This is a video game specifically focused on helping children age 8 to 12 with ADHD it requires supervision from a healthcare professional that’s why it’s FDA approved and needs a prescription. \n\n2. There is a commitment to use this 3 to 5 times a week for at least three months to see results. It does not replace medication it is adjunct therapy to be used in consideration with other treatment modalities. Basically that means the family and the healthcare professionals decide on other things that can help with ADHD this is never a standalone product.\n\n3. As a dualy licensed family nurse practitioner and psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner I find any tools that can help support family and improve the disease process is much better than just medication alone. Enclosing research different treatments read and understand with the product does and does not do before making some flippant and derogatory comments that makes you look uneducated and uninformed.\n\nThis product may not be for everyone but for those with adhd age 8 to 12 it is a new therapeutic  tool that is a game changer",

It’s fascinating work to be a small part of.  One of the reasons I plan on staying for a while is the people who work here.  It would be difficult to find a more collaborative, positive, inclusive group of people, who genuinely love the work they do.  They support each other, regardless of the benefit to themselves or their specific skillset.  It’s also fun.  \r\n\r\nThe company goes out of it's way to offer above average benefits, compensation and employee appreciation with a creative bent. It is evident that a lot of work has gone into this.  How many times in your career can you say you’ve looked forward to coming into work every day?  For me, that is a motivating factor.  Companies talk about their “culture.”  This company works at building an environment that is setting us up for success.  This is a reflection on the carefully chosen leadership and the teams that they've built.  While all different in background and personality, this is a group of individuals that compliment one another in their intellectual abilities and personality traits.  Even the most dynamic people in this company are humble, no matter their level.  Leadership here is largely inclusive and goes above and beyond to offer support, to build up employees, helping them along on their career path.  I believe this is why the company is able to retain its people.    \r\n\r\nAkili is a continuous learning environment.  There's opportunity to learn every single day that we’re here.  There is no getting bored or feeling stagnated here.  There is opportunity to grow in your career and we are supported in continued education, networking, and clear set goals.  We have recently implemented a program to give substantive feedback more frequently. If you excel at Akili, there is career growth opportunity and stability.",

It would be difficult to find a more collaborative, positive, inclusive group of people, who genuinely love the work they do.  They support each other, regardless of the benefit to themselves or their specific skillset.  It’s also fun.  \r\n\r\nThe company goes out of it's way to offer above average benefits, compensation and employee appreciation with a creative bent. It is evident that a lot of work has gone into this.  How many times in your career can you say you’ve looked forward to coming into work every day?  For me, that is a motivating factor.  Companies talk about their “culture.”  This company works at building an environment that is setting us up for success.  This is a reflection on the carefully chosen leadership and the teams that they've built.  While all different in background and personality, this is a group of individuals that compliment one another in their intellectual abilities and personality traits.  Even the most dynamic people in this company are humble, no matter their level.  Leadership here is largely inclusive and goes above and beyond to offer support, to build up employees, helping them along on their career path.  I believe this is why the company is able to retain its people.    \r\n\r\nAkili is a continuous learning environment.  There's opportunity to learn every single day that we’re here.  There is no getting bored or feeling stagnated here.  There is opportunity to grow in your career and we are supported in continued education, networking, and clear set goals.  We have recently implemented a program to give substantive feedback more frequently. If you excel at Akili, there is career growth opportunity and stability.",

      "# [Akili, maker of a video game to treat ADHD, to be acquired for $34 million by Mario Aguilar on 2024-05-29](https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/virtual-therapeutics-acquire-akili-video-games-adhd/)\nA month after announcing it was seeking strategic alternatives, Akili Interactive, maker of a video game designed to treat ADHD, said it will go private in a merger with Virtual Therapeutics. The deal is expected to net Akili’s shareholders $34 million.\n\nAkili made headlines in 2020 when it received Food and Drug Administration clearance for EndeavorRx, a video game designed to treat pediatric ADHD. Akili went public in 2022 in a deal that valued the company at about $1 billion. But despite several strategic pivots, including shifting to direct-to-consumer sales, the company failed to build a sustainable business model. Akili in April announced it would wind down its existing commercial operations and focus on a licensing deal with Japanese pharma company Shionogi while it figured out the best path forward.\n\nadvertisement",
      "# [Virtual Therapeutics, Akili Interactive Strike Definitive Merger Agreement Seeking to Improve Mental Health Through Immersive Video Games by Don Tracy, Associate Editor on 2024-05-31](https://www.pharmexec.com/view/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-strike-definitive-merger-agreement-seeking-to-improve-mental-health-through-immersive-video-games)\nVirtual Therapeutics and Akili, Inc. announced that they have agreed to terms on a definitive merger agreement, aiming to establish a digital health company that creates engaging and immersive games to improve mental health. Under terms of the merger, Akili will now work as a wholly owned company of Virtual Therapeutics, Akili shareholders will receive $0.4340 per share of common stock in cash, representing a 4% premium to the closing stock price.1\n\n“In today’s global mental health crisis, patients deserve access to clinically validated solutions that address their specific needs. We have been able to advance multiple solutions on our platform since founding Virtual Therapeutics, and we look forward to taking a significant step forward through this merger,” said Dan Elenbaas, co-founder, CEO, Virtual Therapeutics, in a press release. “The team at Akili has been successful in applying clinical and scientific rigor to bring new products forward, and we believe their expertise will complement our efforts. Together, we can build a company that brings these behavioral services to as many patients as possible—regardless of where they are or barriers that exist for them today.”\n\nIn February, Akili announced promising results from a Phase III clinical trial conducted by its partner Shionogi & Co. Ltd, for STD-001, a localized version of EndeavorRx, Akili’s prescription digital therapeutic indicated to improve attentional functioning in pediatric patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). EndeavorRx was previously authorized by the FDA for patients aged 8 to 17 years with ADHD.\n\nAs part of the trial, 164 pediatric patients with ADHD aged 6 to 17 years who received environmental adjustments and psychosocial therapies were evaluated for 25 minutes a day over six weeks. According to the company, the group displayed major improvements in the change from baseline in the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) Inattention score compared to the control group (continuing conventional treatments) after six weeks.2\n\n“The latest Japanese clinical trial of our patented, clinically proven technology is an important milestone for many reasons,” said Scott Kollins, chief medical officer, Akili, in a press release. “It not only further validates the efficacy and safety of EndeavorRx, it also moves us and our international partner SHIONOGI a step closer to making the product available in Japan. And if approved in Japan, it will provide an effective and safe option in a country where some front-line pharmaceutical therapies are not as widely available to pediatric patients with ADHD.”\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than one in five people live with a mental illness in the United States, with one in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression. There are several causes of mental illness, such as trauma or a history of abuse, use of drugs and alcohol, chemical imbalances in the brain, and feelings of loneliness or isolation.3\n\n“Akili ran a thorough strategic process, and we believe that this transaction represents Akili’s commitment to delivering value to the Akili stockholder,” said Matt Franklin, CEO, Akili, in the press release. “Virtual Therapeutics has been built by a team with decades of success in the gaming industry and elected to focus their expertise to help solve the growing mental health crisis. Combining our proven track record developing and deploying rigorously validated mobile digital therapeutics with Virtual Therapeutics’ robust portfolio of VR-based mental health solutions and gaming expertise, we aim to create a compelling platform to address mental health needs across several high-impact indications.”\n\nReferences\n\n1.

      "# [Two single arm trials of AKL-T01, a digital therapeutic for adolescents and adults with ADHD by Caitlin A, Deborah N, Raun D, Scott H on 2024-06-19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44184-024-00075-w)\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common pediatric psychiatric conditions, and with the recognition that symptoms often persist into adulthood1, rates of treatment seeking for adult ADHD have increased significantly in recent years2. These trends are echoed in the popular press, with particular attention toward increased rates of adult ADHD diagnoses and medication shortages highlighting a need for improved access to care3,4. Current treatments for ADHD have demonstrated incontrovertible short-term benefits across core symptoms and associated impairments5,6, but have limitations. Pharmacological treatments such as stimulant medications are associated with well-documented side effects, and they may not produce optimal benefits to certain cognitive domains7,8,9. Nonpharmacological interventions (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy) can be difficult to access, in part due to the limited number of qualified providers10,11. Moreover, since cognitive behavior therapy is not regulated, the quality and fidelity of the treatment in real world settings is not consistent with clinical trials supporting its efficacy. Adherence rates over time are generally low for existing standard of care treatment for ADHD, and longitudinal studies have shown that improvements are not maintained beyond 24–36 months12,13. While ADHD symptoms and functional impairment persist throughout adolescence and adulthood, medication use declines after age 11, and those who continue medication tend to do so inconsistently14,15.\n\nLimitations of front-line treatments underscore a need for innovation in the development of efficacious and scalable interventions for ADHD. Given the central role of attention and related cognitive processes in ADHD pathophysiology16, interventions that specifically target these constructs in safe and effective ways are critical. This is especially true as patients with ADHD move into adolescence and adulthood, with inattention becoming the predominant symptom domain endorsed in these age groups17. Computerized cognitive training (CCT) programs have been associated with improvements to working memory and executive functioning in ADHD populations18,19. Meta-analyses suggest non-significant evidence of far transfer (i.e., to impact ADHD symptoms; academic impairment) with CCT, and that evidence weakens with unblinded raters19. However, multi-component training models (i.e., CCT targeting multiple cognitive processes, and not just working memory) show promise, likely due to the heterogeneity of neuropsychological deficits in ADHD19. One such treatment, AKL-T01, is a novel digital therapeutic currently authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as EndeavorRx® (DEN200026)20. EndeavorRx is indicated to improve attentional functioning in children ages 8 to 12 years old with primarily inattentive or combined-presentation ADHD and demonstrated attentional impairment21. AKL-T01 is deployed on mobile devices (tablets and phones) and targets a range of processes implicated in attentional control through cognitive tasks in a videogame-based platform, using a staircase algorithm that personalizes level of difficulty to each individual.\n\nTwo pivotal clinical trials support the safety and efficacy of AKL-T01 for targeting inattention and clinical functioning in pediatric ADHD samples. The first, Software Treatment for Actively Reducing Severity of ADHD (STARS-ADHD), was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing AKL-T01 to a digital control in children 8–12 years old, diagnosed with ADHD, with impairment in objective attention function (as indicated by the Test of Variables of Attention [TOVA]-Attention Performance Index [API] ≤ −1.8), and not taking ADHD medication22. The AKL-T01 group demonstrated significantly greater improvements to attention on the TOVA-API compared to the active control group23. The second study, STARS-ADHD-Adjunctive, was a single-arm trial of AKL-T01 in children ages 8–14, both on and off stimulant medication. Comparable improvements were seen across the medication and non-medication cohorts in ADHD-related impairment and symptoms24. AKL-T01 demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with no serious adverse device effects and a relatively small number of mild to moderate adverse device events (ADEs) in both studies. Together, these trials suggest that AKL-T01 is safe and effective for children with ADHD, and that benefits to attentional functioning and functional impairment can be derived even among those actively participating in gold-standard treatment.\n\nGiven the rising demand for adult ADHD treatment2, the centrality of inattentive symptoms as patients age17, and the need for expanded access to evidence-based interventions for ADHD, an important question is whether similar benefits with AKL-T01 are observed in adolescents and adults with ADHD as in the pediatric population. In the present study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of AKL-T01 for improving objective attention and ADHD-related symptoms in two independent single-arm clinical trials with no comparison group, one in adolescents ages 13–17 (STARS-ADHD-Adolescent), and the other in adults ages 18 and older (STARS-ADHD-Adult). Since both of these studies were explicitly designed to demonstrate substantial equivalence as part of regulatory submissions, they did not include a comparison arm, as supported by regulatory guidance in CFR 806.7(c)(2). Additional information supporting the single-arm trial design, including an extensive discussion of placebo effects and sensitivity analyses, is contained in the Supplementary Materials: Single-Arm Trial.\n\nParticipants\n\nTable 1 contains detailed demographic characteristics for each trial.\n\nAdolescents\n\nOf 526 participants screened, 162 were enrolled between July 29, 2021 and September 1, 2022 (Fig. 1a) from across 13 sites (see Supplementary Materials: Poolability for post-hoc analyses supporting pooling data across sites). The most common reason for screen failure was a baseline score > −1.8 on the TOVA Attention Comparison Score (ACS; n = 314). All 162 enrolled were included in the Safety Population, 146 were included in the Efficacy Population, and 74 were included in the Per Protocol Population (see Methods for definitions). Fifteen participants (9.3%) discontinued the study. In the Efficacy Population, participants were predominantly male (58.9%), White (77.4%) and non-Hispanic/Latino (81.5%), with a mean age of 14.3 years (SD = 1.26). Approximately half (49.3%) reported current stimulant use, and 18.5% reported concurrent psychosocial treatment.\n\nAdults\n\nOf 440 participants screened, 221 participants were enrolled between November 29, 2021 and December 2, 2022 (Fig. 1b) from across 13 sites (see Supplementary Materials: Poolability for post-hoc analyses supporting pooling data across sites). The most common reason for screen failure was a baseline TOVA-ACS > −1.8 (n = 179). All 221 enrolled were included in the Safety Population, 153 were included in the Efficacy Population, and 96 were included in the Per Protocol Population. Seventy-five participants (34%) discontinued the study. In the Efficacy Population, participants were predominantly female (70%), White (77%) and non-Hispanic/Latino (85%), with a mean age of 39.9 years (SD = 12.84). Current stimulant use was reported by 39.2% of participants.\n\nCompliance\n\nAdolescents\n\nMean overall compliance in the Efficacy Population was 72.4%, with an average (SD) of 288 (169) minutes of treatment exposure over 84 (47) missions. Over half (57.5%) of participants in the Efficacy Population met the Per Protocol definition of a minimum of 60% treatment compliance.\n\nAdults\n\nMean overall compliance in the Efficacy Population was 81.1%, with an average (SD) of 530 (320) minutes of treatment exposure over 146 (86) missions. The majority (67.3%) of participants in the Efficacy Population met the Per Protocol definition of a minimum of 60% treatment compliance.\n\nAcross both studies, mean compliance trended downward slightly across study weeks, and this trend was consistent for all analysis populations and subgroups. See Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Table 6 for percent compliance by week.\n\nEfficacy\n\nAdolescents\n\nTOVA-ACS significantly improved from baseline to study day 28, with a mean increase of 2.64 (SD = 3.80), 95% CI [2.02, 3.26], t(145) = 8.40, p < 0.0001, d [95% CI] = 0.70 [0.54, 0.87] (Table 2). Post-hoc sensitivity analyses using Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests of change in TOVA-ACS from baseline to exit yielded similar results (p < 0.0001). Both secondary ADHD-Rating Scale-5 (ADHD-RS-5) endpoints also showed significant improvement from baseline to day 28: inattention subscale M change = −2.99 (SD = 5.38), 95% CI [−3.87, −2.10], t(144) = −6.69, p < 0.0001, d [95% CI] = 0.59 [0.41, 0.76]; total score M change = −4.59 (SD = 8.14), 95% CI [−5.93, −3.25], t(143) = −6.77, p < 0.0001, d [95% CI] = 0.50 [0.35, 0.65] (Table 3). There were no significant differences in any study outcomes between the subgroups who were or were not taking concomitant stimulant medication for TOVA-ACS (t[136.42] = −1.10, p = 0.272), ADHD-RS-5 inattention (t[141.77] = −0.28, p = 0.781), or ADHD-RS-5 total score (t[137.75] = 0.63, p = 0.528).\n\nAdults\n\nTOVA-ACS significantly improved from baseline to study day 42, with a mean increase of 6.46 (SD = 6.95), 95% CI [5.35, 7.57], t(152) = 11.49, p <0.0001, d [95% CI] = 0.86 [0.71, 1.01] (Table 2). Post-hoc sensitivity analyses using Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests of change in TOVA-ACS from baseline to exit yielded similar results (p < 0.0001). Both secondary ADHD-Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV) endpoints also showed significant improvement from baseline to day 42: inattention subscale M change = −5.10 (SD = 4.78), 95% CI [−5.86, −4.34], t(152) = −13.20, p < 0.0001, d [95% CI] = 1.56 [1.33, 1.80]; total score M change = −8.27 (SD = 7.74), 95% CI [−9.51, −7.04], t(152) = −13.23, p < 0.0001, d [95% CI] = 1.12 [0.95, 1.28]. Similarly, adults reported clinically significant improvements from baseline to day 42 on the Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS) ADHD index, M change = −4.30 (SD = 9.18), 95% CI [−5.77, −2.83], t(152) = −5.79, p <0.0001, d [95% CI] = 0.30 [0.15, 0.45], and in quality of life on the Adult ADHD Quality of Life (AAQoL), M change = 7.84 (SD = 13.75), 95% CI [5.64, 10.04], t(152) = 7.05, p <0.0001, d [95% CI] = 0.55 [0.40, 0.71]. There were no significant differences between the subgroups who were versus were not taking concomitant stimulant medication in change on the TOVA-ACS (t[104.21] = −1.21, p = 0.231), ADHD-RS-IV inattention (t[107.56] = 1.61, p = 0.111), ADHD-RS-IV total score (t[105.76] = 1.09, p = 0.277), or CAARS ADHD index (t[123.83] = −1.51, p = 0.133). Those in the stimulant group reported greater improvements in AAQoL from baseline to day 42 (M change = 10.66) relative to those not taking stimulants (M change = 6.02; t[120.82] = −2.03, p = 0.044), though this difference was non-significant after correction for multiple comparisons.\n\nResponder analysis\n\nAdolescents\n\nIn the Efficacy Population, 61.0% were responders based on a 1.4-point improvement on TOVA-ACS (60.8% in the Per Protocol Population), 24.7% were responders based on a TOVA-ACS ≥ 0 at exit visit (27.0% in the Per Protocol Population), and 27.1% were responders based on a ≥ 30% improvement in ADHD RS-5 total score (27.0% in the Per Protocol Population; Table 4).\n\nAdults\n\nIn the Efficacy Population, 83.0% were responders based on a 1.4-point improvement on the TOVA-ACS (84.4% in the Per Protocol Population), 36.6% were responders based on a TOVA-ACS ≥ 0 at exit visit (41.7% in the Per Protocol Population), 27.1% were responders based on a ≥ 30% improvement in ADHD RS-IV total score (34.4% in the Per Protocol Population), and 32.7% were responders based on a ≥ 8-point improvement on the AAQoL (44.8% in the Per Protocol Population).\n\nSafety results\n\nAdolescents\n\n4 participants (2.5%) experienced a treatment-emergent ADE (TE-ADE; Table 5), most commonly decreased frustration tolerance (1.9%) and headache (0.6%). No TE-ADEs were serious or resulted in study discontinuation, and no events were unanticipated as defined by the protocol.\n\nAdults\n\n11 participants (5%) experienced a TE-ADE (Table 6), most commonly nausea (1.8%) and headache (1.4%). No TE-ADEs were serious. 3 (1.4%) were unanticipated and resulted in study discontinuation; these TE-ADEs included headache (1 participant) and nausea (2 participants), and all were considered recovered/resolved after study treatment discontinuation.\n\nAcross the two clinical trials described, we evaluated the use of AKL-T01—which had previously been demonstrated effective in children ages 8–12 with ADHD23,24—for adolescents and adults with ADHD. Results provide preliminary support for the efficacy of AKL-T01; while the studies cannot be directly compared to prior work in younger children due to methodological differences, the magnitude of the effects of AKL-T01 in adolescents and adults was generally medium to large. Further, AKL-T01 was associated with benefits to ADHD-related symptoms across age groups and improvements to quality of life among adult participants, suggesting that treating inattention via video-game-based cognitive control training may translate to real-world benefits.\n\nIn the context of prior pediatric studies23,24, our results in adolescents and adults suggest that AKL-T01’s benefits to attentional functioning extend across the lifespan. Across both trials presented, participants demonstrated significant increases in TOVA-ACS. The TOVA is an objective measure of attentional functioning with low likelihood of expectation of benefit bias (i.e., placebo effect)22; supporting this, no placebo effect for TOVA was observed in the pediatric STARS trial that did include a control condition (see Supplementary Materials: Single-Arm Trial for further discussion of placebo effects). Notably, the magnitude of TOVA-ACS change became larger across age groups (adolescent M change = 2.64; adult M change = 6.46; Fig. 2). As previously stated, differences in trial methodology temper the ability to directly compare TOVA-ACS effects from these two trials to the prior pediatric RCT. However, considering within-treatment-group effect sizes, the greater improvements in attentional functioning observed in adolescents (nearly 3× higher) and adults (nearly 7x higher) relative to children may stem from differences across the populations in motivation and clinical characteristics. In terms of clinical characteristics, adults with ADHD are more likely to report inattentive symptoms17,25, which reflect the primary symptom domain targeted by AKL-T01. In contrast, medications targeting broad ADHD symptoms show similar effect sizes in children, adolescents, and adults9. Regarding motivation, whereas pediatric engagement with AKL-T01 is typically influenced by a caregiver, adults generally self-select into treatment and are therefore more likely to benefit from self-efficacy, a pivotal value in health behavior change26.\n\nAlong with objective attentional functioning, AKL-T01 was associated with benefits to ADHD symptoms across age groups, as measured by the ADHD-RS. The ADHD-RS is a clinician-administered measure that is widely used to assess ADHD symptoms in clinical trials with children, adolescents, and adults14,15,27. Relative to prior pediatric trials23,24, we observed ADHD-RS changes of larger magnitude in the adult data and slightly smaller changes in the adolescent data, though comparisons must be considered in the context of trial methodology differences. Given that participants in the adolescent trial had baseline scores indicating fewer symptoms at study start than in the STARS-ADHD pediatric trial, results suggest a similar relative effect of AKL-T01 on ADHD symptoms across studies. Additionally, in prespecified responder analyses, a comparable percentage of participants in each study (27%) achieved a 30% improvement in ADHD-RS total score, which is widely accepted as a minimal clinically important difference28. Given the evidence in the adult study that AKL-T01 was also associated with benefits to quality of life on the AAQoL, it will be important to similarly evaluate impacts to daily functioning in adolescents, which were not evaluated in the present report.\n\nA critical finding that emerged in the prior pediatric trials of AKL-T0123,24, and which is echoed in the adolescent and adult trials presented here, is that AKL-T01 appears to have comparable effects regardless of whether the patient is concomitantly treated with stimulant medication. Clinical guidelines support medication and cognitive-behavioral therapy as first-line interventions for the treatment of ADHD6. Our finding that patients taking stimulant medication seemed to benefit from AKL-T01 beyond their existing medication regimen aligns with evidence that multimodal treatment yields superior outcomes for ADHD symptoms and functional impairment29. The improvements across groups to attention and ADHD symptoms suggests that AKL-T01 is beneficial for patients with ADHD whose inattention is not currently well-controlled with stimulants, as well as those who do not include stimulant medication as part of their current ADHD treatment. It will be important to continue to evaluate potential differences in AKL-T01 treatment outcomes according to concomitant medication status with larger studies explicitly powered to detect potential subgroup differences, and geared toward understanding how the timing of stimulant medication use relative to AKL-T01 engagement may influence results.\n\nStrengths and limitations of the present study point to directions for future research. Strengths include relatively large samples, multisite trials, and a consistency of design across both studies that allowed for comparisons across the lifespan. One limitation of both trials presented here is the single-arm design, which tempers the strength of conclusions about clinical efficacy. The lack of change in TOVA-ACS in the active control group in the previously described pediatric RCT provides indirect evidence against a placebo effect (see also Fig. 2); whether the same holds true for adults and adolescents remains unknown (though see Supplementary Materials: Single-Arm Trial for justification of the single-arm trial design). While the single-arm trials cannot be directly compared to the pediatric RCT, the general magnitude of effects in adolescents and adults, which exceeded the previously reported effect of AKL-T01 in children by 2- to 7-fold, supports a beneficial impact of the intervention beyond regression to the mean or placebo effect. Given that rating scales may be more subject to placebo effects than the TOVA (e.g., if participants previously heard about the FDA clearance of EndeavorRx and had expectancy bias), it will be important for future studies to consider the impact of AKL-T01 on ADHD symptoms and quality of life relative to an active control. Another consideration is dropout, which was higher in the adult study than in the adolescent trial or prior pediatric trials, though comparable to dropout rates in recent ADHD medication trials30,31. Future studies should consider possible reasons for differential dropout rates (e.g., the longer duration of treatment in the adult study; parental accountability among adolescents). Additional studies to investigate longer term benefits of AKL-T01 in adults and adolescents are needed to determine whether AKL-T01 has lasting effects on attention and related processes. It will also be important to test the generalizability of the intervention’s effects to adults without TOVA-ACS impairment at baseline, and to understand predictors of response vs. non-response to treatment. Finally, future studies are needed to evaluate the minimum effective dose of AKL-T01, particularly to see if regimens involving a lower time commitment than the recommended 25 minutes per day, 5 days a week can lead to comparable outcomes.\n\nIn two independent trials in adolescents and adults with ADHD, AKL-T01 demonstrated a favorable safety profile and consistent clinical benefit, resulting in significant improvement in attention functioning, ADHD symptoms, and, in adults, quality of life. The magnitude of response was comparable to or larger than that of previous studies of this digital therapeutic, with particularly strong benefits in adults. Given the increased rates of treatment-seeking in adults with ADHD2, the significant barriers to accessing empirically-supported treatments10,11, and the centrality of inattentive symptoms as ADHD patients develop into adulthood28, AKL-T01 holds promise as a scalable, targeted treatment for inattention in adolescent and adult ADHD with evident impact on real-world symptoms. Consistent evidence across multiple trials supports the value of AKL-T01 for patients currently taking stimulant medications, in line with clinical guidelines supporting a multimodal treatment regimen that incorporates behavioral, pharmacological, and now digital interventions.\n\nOverview\n\nThe STARS-ADHD-Adolescent trial (NCT04897074) was a multicenter, single-arm, open-label study to evaluate objective attention functioning and ADHD symptoms in adolescents aged 13 to 17 years 10 months old, with a diagnosis of ADHD (combined or inattentive presentation), stably on or off ADHD medication, after 4 weeks of AKL-T01. The STARS-ADHD-Adult trial (NCT05183919) was a multicenter, single-arm, open-label study to evaluate objective attention functioning and ADHD symptoms and impairments in adults 18 years and older diagnosed with combined or inattentive ADHD, stably on or off ADHD medication, after 6 weeks of AKL-T01.\n\nThe trials were conducted in compliance with the Institutional Review Board (IRB) regulations stated in Title 21 of the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 56, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations and guidelines, and all applicable local regulations. The trials were approved by each site’s institutional review board (WIRB-Copernicus Group). Written informed consent (and assent for adolescents) was obtained from all participants and (for adolescents) their parent or legally authorized representative, respectively, and as appropriate given the participants’ ages. IRB-approved forms containing a detailed description of the study treatment, study procedures, and risks were provided to participants and (for the adolescent study) caregivers.\n\nStudy design\n\nThe STARS-ADHD-Adolescent study was designed to enroll up to 165 participants from up to 20 US-based sites. Study participation included a screening visit, a baseline visit (on-site; day 1), the 28-day treatment phase (at home; days 2 to 27), and an exit visit on day 28 ( ± 3 days; on-site). AKL-T01 treatment involved playing 6 to 8 missions of the game per day, for at least 5 days per week, for 4 consecutive weeks.\n\nThe STARS-ADHD-Adult study was initially designed to enroll up to 325 participants, with a minimum sample size of 301. An adaptive study design was adopted to enroll participants until the Standard Error (SE) of mean TOVA‑ACS change was ≤ 0.277, the threshold required to maintain 90% power to detect changes in the primary endpoint. However, the adult trial was discontinued prior to reaching the prespecified enrollment numbers for two primary reasons unrelated to safety or efficacy: First, the adolescent trial had demonstrated robust and meaningful effects that were larger than anticipated; second, projections based on enrollment rates indicated that the trial may not have reached completion with the target sample size until 2024. Although the stopping rule based on the target SE was not achieved, prespecified efficacy analyses yielded p-values < 0.000001 for primary and secondary outcomes necessary for making efficacy-related decisions. Study participation included a screening visit, a baseline visit (on site; study day 1), the 42‑day treatment phase (at home; days 2 to 42), and an exit visit on day 42 ( ± 3 days; on site). AKL-T01 treatment involved playing 6 to 8 missions per day, for at least 5 days per week, for 6 consecutive weeks, consistent with prior studies of this technology in adults32.\n\nParticipants\n\nFor STARS-ADHD-Adolescent, primary inclusion criteria were ages between 13 and 17 years, 10 months inclusive at the time of consent, and a diagnosis of ADHD combined or inattentive presentation, according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)5 as confirmed by MINI-Kid version 7.0.233. Participants were also required to have a demonstrated attentional impairment defined by TOVA-ACS ≤ −1.8. All participants had an IQ score ≥ 80 (as assessed by KBIT-II)34,35 and the absence of any medical condition that could impact study participation or potentially confound study assessments. Full study inclusion and exclusion criteria are available in Supplementary Table 7.\n\nMain inclusion criteria for STARS-ADHD-Adult were adults 18 years and older with a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD combined or inattentive presentation, according to DSM-55 as confirmed by the MINI for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorders Studies (Adult) version 7.0.236. Participants were also required to have a demonstrated attentional impairment defined by TOVA‑ACS ≤ −1.8 and ADHD RS‑IV ≥ 24. Full study inclusion and exclusion criteria are available in Supplementary Table 8.\n\nProcedures\n\nAt baseline, participants received an iPad Mini with AKL-T01 software and completed training to learn proper device and software usage.\n\nAt the screening and exit visits, participants were assessed via validated measures of cognitive functioning (TOVA) and clinical symptoms (see “Outcomes”). Participants were instructed to avoid caffeine for 4–6 hours prior to the visit. At the investigator’s discretion, participants may also have been instructed to delay that day’s ADHD medication until after completion of the TOVA at both screening and exit visits to avoid unintentional impact of ADHD medication on TOVA performance37.\n\nParticipants completed AKL-T01 treatment at home in combination with their previously established stable ADHD treatment regimen (which could include stimulant medications, other psychoactive medications, and nonpharmacological therapies), and keep their previously established treatment stable for 4+ weeks prior to enrollment and throughout the study. Recommended treatment with AKL-T01 involved playing 6 to 8 missions per day (approximately 25 min) for at least 5 days per week for 4 weeks (adolescents) or 6 weeks (adults). Compliance was monitored electronically, and the software generated automatic reminders to play. The treatment automatically locked after the allocated maximum number of daily missions, and no further play was permitted until the next calendar day.\n\nAny adverse device events (ADEs) occurring during any phase of the study judged by the principal investigator (PI) to be related to the intervention were recorded. If sites recorded mid-study discontinuation, they were required to indicate whether the discontinuation was due to an ADE or something else; if it was an ADE, then an ADE report was required. During the post-treatment visit, sites systematically collected data on whether participants reported any ADEs during the study period and, if so, completed an ADE report.\n\nIntervention\n\nAKL-T01 is a digital therapeutic built using a proprietary algorithm (Selective Stimulus Management Engine [SSME™]) designed to train interference management at an adaptive and personalized high degree of difficulty. Interference was instantiated through a video game-based interface displaying two tasks done in parallel (multitasking): a perceptual discrimination targeting task in which users responded to the stimulus targets and ignored the distractors (similar to a Go-No-Go task), and a sensory motor navigation task in which users continuously adjusted their location to interact with or avoid positional targets. Performance in each task was assessed during single and multitask conditions. As users proceeded through the treatment, periodic recalibration occurred to maintain an optimal difficulty level.\n\nOutcomes\n\nPrimary endpoints\n\nAll efficacy outcomes were prespecified unless otherwise indicated. The primary endpoint of both studies was change (study day 1 to study day 28 [adolescent] or day 42 [adult]) on the TOVA-ACS, which is a composite score of objective attentional functioning, with norms relative to both ADHD and non-clinical samples. The clinical cutoff on the ACS is zero, with scores below zero observed in samples with ADHD and scores above zero typical of non-clinical samples. Positive changes in the ACS indicate improvement in objective attentional functioning22.\n\nSecondary endpoints [adolescent]\n\nSecondary endpoints of the STARS-ADHD-Adolescent study were change (study day 1 to study day 28) in the ADHD RS-5 inattention scale and total scores. The ADHD RS-5 is a parent-reported, clinician-administered assessment of the child’s frequency of ADHD symptoms, consisting of 18 items rated on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (never or rarely) to 3 (very often). The inattention scale score is the sum of the 9 items that comprise the inattention scale, and the total score is the sum of all 18 items38. We also examined responder rates, defined in three ways: (1) a 1.4-point improvement on TOVA-ACS from baseline after 4 weeks of AKL-T01 [Note that in the original adolescent study protocol, a TOVA-ACS change greater than or equal to 1.0 was prespecified as indicating a responder; however, we revised the criterion post-hoc to a more stringent TOVA-ACS change of 1.4 to be consistent with the prespecified definition of a responder as TOVA change equal to or greater than 1.4 points in the original pediatric STARS RCT.], (2) TOVA-ACS ≥ 0 at exit visit (defined post-hoc), and (3) ≥ 30% improvement in ADHD RS-5 total score from baseline after 4 weeks of AKL-T01.\n\nSecondary endpoints [adult]\n\nSecondary endpoints of the STARS-ADHD-Adult study were change (study day 1 to study day 42) in the clinician-administered ADHD RS-IV with Adult Prompts inattention subscale and total scores after 6 weeks of treatment with AKL-T01. We also examined change in the self-reported Adult ADHD Quality of Life (AAQoL)39, change in the Conner’s Adult ADHD Rating Scale–Self-report: Short Version (CAARS-S:S)40, and responder rates, defined in four ways: (1) a 1.4-point improvement on TOVA-ACS from baseline after 6 weeks of AKL-T01, (2) TOVA-ACS ≥ 0 at exit visit (defined post-hoc), (3) ≥ 30% improvement in ADHD RS-IV total score from baseline after 6 weeks of AKL-T01, and (4) AAQoL ≥ 8 point improvement from baseline after 6 weeks of AKL-T01.\n\nCompliance\n\nPercent compliance was derived as the number of completed missions divided by the expected minimum number of completed missions multiplied by 100. The minimum expected number of completed missions was 30/week, or 120 total in the adolescent study and 180 total in the adult study. Percent compliance could greater than 100 because the expected number of completed missions was based on 6 missions/day, 5 days/week, but participants were given the opportunity to complete up to 8 missions/day and play up to 7 days/week.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nAll analyses were performed according to a prespecified analysis plan, unless indicated as post hoc. All analyses were conducted using a complete case analysis; no missing data were imputed.\n\nPower analysis\n\nSample size was calculated based on a zero-change from baseline in TOVA-ACS against the alternative of a positive change from baseline in TOVA-ACS with a one-sample t-test using EAST© version 6.5. For the adolescent trial, it was assumed that the TOVA-ACS SD (σ) in this population would be as large as observed with the pediatric population in the STARS-ADHD trial (SD = 3.2). The significance level was defined by a one-sided α at 0.025 and achievement of a minimum power of 90%. Assuming a previously observed control-corrected effect size of µ = 0.9 and observed σ = 3.2, a sample size of 135 was required to detect the effect with 90% power. To account for early discontinuation, planned enrollment was 150–165 participants. For the adult trial, it was assumed that due to greater heterogeneity in the adult ADHD population, the TOVA‑ACS σ would be 1.5 times that observed with pediatric populations (STARS‑ADHD), where the standard deviation was 3.2. Assuming σ = 4.8 and the previously observed control-corrected effect size of µ = 0.9, a sample size of 301 participants was required to detect the effect with 90% power. To account for early discontinuation, planned enrollment was 325 participants.\n\nAnalysis populations\n\nThe trials yielded three analysis populations. Safety analyses were conducted on the Safety Population, which included all exposed to AKL-T01. The Efficacy Population consisted of all participants who took AKL-T01 home and completed both baseline and end of study assessments. The Per Protocol population was the subset of the Efficacy Population that met the definition for “adequate dosage” or “minimum acceptable exposure” to the game. For adolescents, this was defined as completion of at least 60% of missions, equivalent to 72 of 120 missions (at least 6 missions/day × 5 days/week × 4 weeks), and having the day 28 exit visit occur between day 22 and day 34, inclusive. For adults, this was defined as completion of at least 60% of missions, equivalent to 108 of 180 missions (at least 6 missions/day × 5 days/week × 6 weeks), and having the day 42 exit visit occur between day 36 and day 48, inclusive.\n\nThe primary endpoint was change in TOVA-ACS, calculated as the score at day 28 (adolescent) or day 42 (adult) minus the score at baseline for each participant. A one-sample t-test (0.05 significance level) was used to test the null hypothesis that change from baseline equals 0. The samples were of sufficient size such that the test was robust to deviations from the normality assumption due to the central limit theorem. We also conducted post-hoc sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome for each study using non-parametric Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests of change in TOVA-ACS from baseline to exit. A similar set of t-tests was conducted for secondary endpoints. The familywise type 1 error rate for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints was 0.025 and was controlled using the fixed sequence method29. For responder analyses, responder rates were reported descriptively by number and percentage of patients meeting each response definition (see above). We also compared efficacy on primary and secondary endpoints across patients who were versus were not using concomitant stimulant medication. Note that while study participants could be taking other (i.e., non-stimulant) psychoactive medication, subgroup analyses are specifically based on concomitant stimulant use only.\n\nSafety endpoints summarized for the Safety Population included incidence, severity, and relationship to study treatment of treatment-emergent adverse device effects (TE-ADEs) and were reported overall and by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).",
