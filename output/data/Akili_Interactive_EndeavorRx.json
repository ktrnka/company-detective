      "# [EndeavorRx — Akili Interactive](https://www.akiliinteractive.com/endeavorrx)\nEndeavorRx Indications, Safety and Cautions\n\nIndications:\n\nEndeavorRx is a digital therapeutic indicated to improve attention function as measured by computer-based testing in children ages 8-12 years old with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD, who have a demonstrated attention issue. Patients who engage with EndeavorRx demonstrate improvements in a digitally assessed measure, Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA®), of sustained and selective attention and may not display benefits in typical behavioral symptoms, such as hyperactivity. EndeavorRx should be considered for use as part of a therapeutic program that may include clinician-directed therapy, medication, and/or educational programs, which further address symptoms of the disorder.\n\nSafety:\n\nOf 538 participants using EndeavorRx, 50 participants (9.3%) experienced treatment-related adverse events (probable, likely), and three participants experienced treatment-related adverse events with the digital control, in studies where a control was used. EndeavorRx associated adverse events included frustration (6.1%), headache (1.3%), dizziness (0.6%), emotional reaction (0.4%), nausea (0.4%), and aggression (0.2%). There were no serious adverse events. All adverse events were generally transient. Only 3 events led to device discontinuation, and no subject reported lasting or irreversible effects after discontinuation.\n\nCautions:\n\nRx only: Federal law restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a physician. EndeavorRx should only be used by the patient for whom the prescription was written. For medical questions, please contact your child’s healthcare provider. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, please dial 911. EndeavorRx is not intended to be used as a stand-alone therapeutic and is not a substitution for your child’s medication.\n\nIf your child experiences frustration, emotional reaction, dizziness, nausea, headache, eye-strain, or joint pain while playing EndeavorRx pause the treatment. If the problem persists contact your child’s healthcare provider. If your child experiences a seizure stop the treatment and contact your child’s healthcare provider.\n\nEndeavorRx may not be appropriate for patients with photo-sensitive epilepsy, color blindness, or physical limitations that restrict use of a mobile device; parents should consult with their child’s healthcare provider.\n\nPlease follow all of your mobile device manufacturer’s instructions for the safe operation of your mobile device.

      "# [ADHD in The Workplace — Akili Interactive](https://www.akiliinteractive.com/workplacesurvey)\nEmployees with ADHD are navigating their careers with intention, but a lack of adequate support. To cultivate an inclusive and thriving work environment, companies must transcend conventional approaches and provide better guidance for managers, and more comprehensive support for employees. These insights emerge from the new ADHD in the Workplace Study conducted by Akili and Wakefield Research, shedding light on the need and opportunity for ADHD accommodations at work to maximize the potential of a neurodiverse workforce.\n\nInformation was collected from US employed adults¹: 500 US employed adults with ADHD and 500 US managers (with or without ADHD), to understand the everyday challenges and experiences of those with ADHD at work. The survey covered the impact of impairment, disclosure to employers, experiences of stigma, manager misconceptions, treatment options, and more.\n\nThe research revealed that employees with ADHD face compounding challenges at work that can sidetrack career goals and take a toll on mental health.\n\n87% of employees with ADHD report experiencing a negative impact of ADHD on their career\n\n97% feel they would be capable of accomplishing more if they could better manage their symptoms.\n\n95% feel limited by the number of treatment options available to them.\n\nEmployees with ADHD are seeking a more nuanced understanding and awareness from their supervisors of their strengths and needs for additional support, but managers feel unequipped to fully provide that support. Namely, 81% of managers report that they don’t feel completely prepared to appropriately address employee needs if an employee discloses an ADHD diagnosis.\n\nIf companies don’t take action to support their employees with ADHD, they run the risk of driving these employees away, with additional impacts on engagement and productivity. In light of the ongoing stimulant medication shortage (see FDA-DEA letter 2023), it has become even more urgent to support employees with adequate and varied resources. The report explores how companies should enhance their training for managers on workplace resources and benefits, as well as provide more treatment options for employees with ADHD. Akili has expanded options available with the launch of EndeavorOTC.\n\nThe Impact of Misconceptions about ADHD in the Workplace\n\nIn today’s workplace, misconceptions about ADHD abound.\n\n92% of employees believe that their colleagues hold misconceptions about ADHD, the most common of which is “people with ADHD just need to try harder”\n\n75% of employees with ADHD report experiencing increased micromanagement by supervisors relative to their peers\n\n56% believe their condition has specifically led them to being demoted, overlooked for promotions, or their job responsibilities being taken away\n\nThis figure jumps to 65% for parents with ADHD, highlighting the varied challenges of those with multiple home and work responsibilities\n\nBeyond Misconceptions: The Daily Realities of ADHD in the Workplace\n\nWhile misconceptions about ADHD serve to hinder employees with ADHD, the genuine challenges posed by ADHD symptoms also impact daily work experiences.\n\nNearly 2 in 3 (65%) of employees with ADHD say that accomplishing day-to-day work tasks while managing ADHD symptoms poses a moderate to significant challenge\n\n54% say they’re getting by, but would need more support to reach their full potential\n\n19% say they are barely getting by and really need additional support.\n\nThe most prevalent symptoms include being easily distracted or sidetracked, with 59% of employees with ADHD citing this as a primary concern, followed by 56% who report a lack of focus and engagement at work. These struggles are not limited to challenges with focusing attention, as 32% of employees report difficulty building relationships with colleagues. Gender nuances emerge in this context as well. Overall women reported more symptoms on average than men (4.6 symptoms vs. 4.0 symptoms).\n\nADHD takes a toll on employees in multiple ways, and 88% of employees with ADHD report that the stimulant shortage has further impacted their work. The vast majority of employees with ADHD (90%) describe errors, conflicts, or extra hours at work as a result of challenges managing their ADHD. Nearly half (46%) have missed a deadline or meeting. In addition, employees have duplicated work that had already been done (31%), sent incorrect information to a boss or client (31%) or missed work altogether (31%) as a result of challenges managing their ADHD.\n\nThis is consistent with previous research finding that employees with ADHD may lose an average of 29 days of productivity per year in the US as compared to their colleagues without ADHD.\n\nFurthermore, unmanaged ADHD symptoms can also be a reinforcing cycle, as 44% of employees with ADHD report that challenges managing their symptoms have caused them to feel unmotivated. Additionally 71% have reported it has led to them feeling anxious and 40% have reported it has led to them feeling depressed, further adding to the burden of the disorder.\n\nOn the other hand, nearly all employees with ADHD (98%) recognize that there are positive aspects of their ADHD that have helped them at work including increased creativity (51%), ability to think outside the box (49%), and higher levels of empathy (46%). Tapping into these strengths can be a powerful way to enhance workplace satisfaction, engagement and outcomes.\n\nFor managers, there appears to be a high level of familiarity with ADHD in general, with 83% of managers reporting that they are very or extremely familiar with ADHD. Of the managers surveyed, 21% report personally having ADHD. While this could be due to selection bias, it may also be that there are high levels of people with ADHD in management positions relative to the overall prevalence. Additionally, 74% of managers know someone at a current or previous job with ADHD and 37% directly supervised someone that they believed or confirmed had an ADHD diagnosis. While these numbers are encouraging, awareness is not the same as understanding how best to help.\n\nIn fact, 59% of managers report that they don’t feel completely prepared to appropriately respond if an employee tells them that they have ADHD. This gap between awareness and preparation underscores the need for more comprehensive training and education for managers.\n\nThe Value of Support\n\nFor employees diagnosed with ADHD, understanding and support from their employers and direct supervisors often take precedence over other workplace factors. 93% of employees with ADHD rate having a supervisor who knows how to support and work with them as more valuable than any office perk. When telling a supervisor about their ADHD, employees are looking for both practical support from supervisors on their working styles as well as additional workplace resources. For example, 55% of employees hope to gain acceptance of how their work style may differ from that of their colleagues and 24% are hoping for workplace resources.\n\nThe lack of training and resources has a direct impact on companies’ abilities to retain talent. For nearly half of employees with ADHD (45%), the challenges they experience in managing their symptoms at their current job have caused them to search for a new one or to consider doing so with nearly 1 in 10 (9%) already looking for a new position. This is especially true for younger generations – 62% of Gen Z and 57% of Millennials reported looking for, or planning to look for, a new job specifically because of challenges related to their ADHD (compared to 45% of Gen X and 26% of Boomers).\n\nRecommendations\n\nEmployees | For employees, there is a clearly expressed need for both acceptance of one’s own unique working style and additional tools and resources. Acceptance can start with a recognition of one’s own strengths and thinking about ways to shape your work tasks to fit your own learning style. This could involve identifying tasks that are energizing and that you are able to focus on and brainstorm ways to incorporate more of them into your day or intersperse them between more boring tasks. It may also involve tasks that involve higher stress, pressure or mental challenge (this can be a superpower!), novel or varied tasks, hands-on work, and/or topics of personal interest. As a next step, it can be helpful to develop a system of organization that complements your cognitive style, and to build your attentional control by engaging in specific cognitive activities designed to target and strengthen mental processes needed for attention.\n\nThe next set of strategies is based on communicating a need for support from others. When talking with a coworker or supervisor about having ADHD, think about your goal in telling them. Is it so others will better understand? For support? Figuring out how to better work together? Knowing the purpose will help guide the conversation. Based on your goal, share relevant information, whether it’s basic info or misconceptions about ADHD or more personally relevant experiences and strengths. Then you can discuss strategies and/or ask for support. The other person will likely ask questions, to think about how you’d like to respond. Ultimately, deciding whether or not to talk with coworkers or a supervisor about having ADHD is a personal decision. Guidance from a mental health professional or coach can be helpful in weighing the considerations and preparing for a conversation.\n\nManagers | Managers can help by creating an environment of psychological safety, where employees feel comfortable talking about their ADHD diagnosis and how they can best be supported. These conversations should not be forced on employees, but instead made clear that they are welcome without putting anyone on the spot. Furthermore, studies have shown that individuals with ADHD may find workplace accommodations to be helpful including reduction of auditory distractions, and managers who provide organization advice, clear delegation of tasks and clearly defined roles, or extra reminders about due dates. It’s important to remember that not all individuals want these accommodations, however. The most important thing is not to make assumptions and instead to talk to the individual in order to understand their particular needs.\n\nCompanies | In order to retain talent, minimize losses to productivity and create an environment where employees feel engaged and have the opportunity to thrive, there is a deep need for additional resources and training. Employers can provide educational materials about ADHD for all of their employees and can provide manager-specific trainings on topics such as “How to Create and Environment of Psychological Safety,” “How to Become Aware of (and Address) Our Own Biases” and “How to Provide Resources and Support for Employees with ADHD.” They can recognize the strengths of employees with ADHD diagnoses and support these employees in reaching their potential for the benefit of these employees and the company. Employers should also check benefits to make sure they are not arbitrarily excluding coverage for adults with ADHD, and consider additional benefits and resources in order to enable employees to work at their best.\n\nWith increased awareness of the gaps in supporting employees with ADHD in the workplace comes the urgent need to address these gaps through education, training and resources so as to unlock the potential of a neurodiverse workforce.\n\nTo learn more about a new kind of treatment option available for adults with ADHD:",

Children with ADHD are now “playing” their medicine thanks to an emerging category of medicine – digital therapeutics (DTx). In June 2020, the industry experienced a watershed moment when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared the first-ever prescription video game. At the end of 2020, a mobile sleep app received FDA clearance to treat nightmares caused by Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). These and other recent milestones in creative and innovative products are paving the way for a new pillar of medicine. Patients and doctors are already recognizing the value of DTx on the market. And with increased awareness of and experience with these unique treatments, we can expect a massive increase in demand.\n\nThis burgeoning industry has been propelled to the forefront of medicine with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, which shined a light on the need for innovative treatment options that can be used at home from your phone or tablet. DTx not only meet that need, but importantly they meet the new expectations of patients: control, flexibility, and seamless integration.\n\nWhy did Covid-19 alter the path for DTx acceptance and adoption, and how will it position the industry to grow in 2021?\n\nAcceleration driven by Covid-19\n\nConsumer expectations of always-on access and tech-savvy solutions have transformed the leisure, retail, and finance industries among others – but medicine is one area people begrudgingly accept as “the way it has to be.” However, the pandemic massively accelerated expectations around the most critical aspects of people’s lives, inciting a more tech-forward approach to medicine. The broad and lasting shift in patient expectations can be attributed to two specific drivers:\n\nCovid-19 demanded convenience and accessibility of digital health; DTx perfectly fit: When the pandemic hit, digital healthcare went from novel to necessary. Covid-19 moved healthcare from the doctor’s office to the living room with many patients opting into digital healthcare solutions, such as telemedicine or ordering prescription refills online. This inherently increased acceptance of digital health and introduced people to a simplified experience that demonstrated healthcare efficiency is possible.\n\nThis demand for quicker and easier approaches to healthcare isn’t going away. Once consumers get a taste of efficiency, they’ll continue to demand it. Just look to Amazon’s decision to integrate pharmaceutical delivery into its rapid home delivery revolution. Patients are asking how to most efficiently access their medicine.\n\nBut DTx offer more than just rapid access; they meet patients on their own terms and engage them in their care. DTx are accessed from anywhere, personalized and automatically adaptable, and rich with data to foster meaningful conversations with the patient, caregiver, and providers. In that way, DTx are a key new therapeutic pillar answering an important and futuristic question in medicine: How is my treatment tailored for me and my life?\n\n2. Long overdue attention on mental health: Not only has the pandemic increased mental health challenges across the population, it uncovered an enormous need for new treatment options. One representative example in ADHD: 90% of pediatric patients are on medication and 45% are receiving behavioral therapy; and yet, 80% are unsatisfied with their treatment or want more options. And that was before families were faced with remote schooling, limited in-person behavioral services, and the general added stress of a national pandemic and alteration of daily life. [This is based on a 2017 Akili market research.]\n\nThese data tell an important story. Drugs and therapy, while critical to the treatment of symptoms of many diseases and disorders, are often not the complete answer. DTx can be a missing piece of the puzzle, providing a new effective tool that can work in tandem with other treatment options. And importantly, DTx can deliver technologies designed to impact brain and mental processes in entirely new ways through new physiological mechanisms.\n\nAdvancement will still require clearing hurdles\n\nDespite the proven success of some DTx solutions in clinical trials and growing awareness among consumers, the industry still needs to stretch the minds of many, including physicians and insurance providers. Realizing the full potential of DTx to transform the patient experience requires imagination and creativity, areas in which traditional medicine has been, rightfully, more conservative. The establishment of clinical trial data and regulatory successes for prescription products remain key for credibility, and now the products themselves must inspire confidence.\n\nEarly pioneering DTx represented innovative expansions of traditional medicine approaches, supporting existing treatments and digitizing medical processes and behavioral therapy. As the industry evolves, we’re seeing a second generation of products driven by new mechanisms that only technology can deploy. This gradual evolution is well-designed to shift traditional mindsets and pave the way for other DTx companies to follow, using technology to do what traditional medicine cannot.\n\nThe next frontier for DTx companies will be securing buy-in from insurance providers. We’ve already seen innovative leaders dip their toes in the water of offering DTx to members – in July 2020, UnitedHealth Group piloted a digital therapeutic designed to improve the health of patients with type 2 diabetes, and some of the earliest prescription digital therapeutics are gaining important early coverage decisions. As more providers engage broadly in digital health offerings, expect a boom of more insurance companies looking to validate digital therapeutics to support their members’ health, especially in mental and cognitive health. It’s just a matter of time before their members demand it, and providers slow to adopt will be left behind.\n\nDTx in 2021 and beyond\n\nIn the wake of COVID-19, people are not only showing a willingness to accept DTx as valuable treatments for various conditions but beginning to demand it. Much like their favorite consumer app or game, digital medicine is becoming a source of comfort and relief, putting people in control of their treatment in a time when there are so many unknowns surrounding their health.\n\nComputer scientist Roy Amara once observed, “we tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.” As is often the case with products positioned for exponential growth, initial adoption of DTx has taken time. While development has been well underway for the last decade, the payoff is just now being seen and ubiquity will happen rapidly.\n\nIt took the urgency and sense of purpose associated with Covid-19 to mobilize digital transformation within health care. Will people again accept driving to a doctor’s office and sitting in a waiting room when they’ve experienced the efficiency and comfort of an appointment via video call from their home? Will they continue to visit the pharmacy, when they can have medications proactively shipped to them at the right time?\n\nTechnology is disrupting healthcare to bring a better experience to patients, and there will be lasting changes. In the next year, doctors will more regularly turn to DTx treatments alongside traditional medication for conditions like substance abuse, ADHD and sleeplessness. How long will it be before physicians and their patients start routinely asking for and expecting digital treatment options for other mental, physical and cognitive conditions?\n\nThe beauty of DTx products is that, at their core, they give people control of their care, adapt to them, and integrate into their lives. As consumer mindsets continue to shift in 2021, so will their demand for easily accessible, personalized and enjoyable medicine. As inefficiency in medicine becomes a thing of the past, let’s embrace the future that has arrived. The experience of medicine can, in fact, be wonderful.",

      "# [Q&A with Global Gaming Citizen Dr. Adam Gazzaley — Akili Interactive by Guest User on 2021-12-15](https://www.akiliinteractive.com/console-blog/2021/12/15/qampa-with-global-gaming-citizen-dr-adam-gazzaley)\nAdam has devoted his career to exploring neuroscience and cognition, and how technology can be used to offer real-world solutions. One of Adam’s many accomplishments includes the research and development of the science behind EndeavorRx(TM) – the first video game to receive clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nWe’re so proud to (virtually) stand by Adam as he receives this important award and wanted to take this opportunity to speak with him about what led him here and what’s in store for the future of the field.\n\nMe: Congratulations on being recognized as one of this year’s Global Gaming Citizens. Can you tell me how you began exploring technological approaches to improving cognition?\n\nAdam: Thank you so much, I’m delighted to receive this honor and proud to share it with the entire Akili team.\n\nWhen I was growing up, I always wanted to be a scientist. During my undergraduate years, I became interested in the brain, and I found the work to be satisfying because it allowed me to apply conceptual learnings in real life. After decades of advanced education, I wanted to use my experience with neuroscience to help people more directly.\n\nWhile living in San Francisco, I became interested in the emerging technology around me. As I watched my own field struggle with innovation, I started using these technological advances in attention experiments in the lab and discovered there is a very selective network in the brain that can be activated through experiences. We had an “aha” moment and realized we could use modern technology like video games to create immersive engagement that would allow us to activate the brain networks selectively, thereby improving cognitive function and addressing what I see as a cognition crisis.\n\nMe: You’ve talked about a “cognition crisis.” What is it and how does it impact society today?\n\nAdam: The first step in understanding the cognition crisis is defining it, which presents a challenge because not all cognitive scientists view cognition the same way. I view cognition very broadly and include all the higher order abilities of our mind, spanning attention, perception, memory, imagination, creativity, decision-making, reasoning, emotional regulation, empathy, compassion and more. Under this definition, we can look at conditions like depression – whether it be clinical or a sad emotional response – on the same spectrum as other memory or attention disorders because the more we learn about the brain and its neural networks, the more we realize it’s difficult to separate each of these conditions into individual categories.\n\nHumans have done an amazing job addressing many of the ailments facing us. With that said, we’re also seeing increasing rates of suicide among young people living, as well as a stagnant increase in cognitive impairments related to aging and memory, including dementia. While there have been incredible improvements in our ability to manage disease, suffering, and mortality across other medical domains, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done to manage this cognition crisis.\n\nMe: What is being done to treat cognitive impairments today?\n\nAdam: Treatment is challenging because people feel they should be able to use their “willpower” to overcome cognitive impairments. This is a common stigma when it comes to depression, anxiety and attention disorders. While prescription medication is an important element of treatment planning, even if medication helps manage some symptoms, the environmental causes will continue to persist if not addressed. This is where we see digital therapeutics come into play – pun intended – as part of a treatment plan.\n\nMe: As a Game Awards Global Gaming Citizen, I’d love to know: what are you most excited about for the future potential of gaming technology and its ability to improve cognition?\n\nAdam: I’ve been working in this field for a long time and we’re just now starting to get people engaged with these types of digital treatments. It’s been an incredibly exciting journey for me to follow the project with Akili from every stage – from the idea, the actual research, the design, development, research study completion and then putting the product in front of patients and truly making a difference in their treatment. I’m excited about the near-term future where we’ll see digital therapeutics reach even more people across different clinical conditions.\n\nWith the rising prevalence of innovative technological therapies, it’s also encouraging to see more awareness in cognitive health and functioning. There is a really interesting future ahead of our field and the work we’re doing at Akili proves this cognitive crisis can be overcome by dedicating resources to continue exploring cutting-edge solutions.",
      "# [Akili’s Vision for Equitable Benefit in Digital Therapeutics — Akili Interactive by Guest User on 2022-11-17](https://www.akiliinteractive.com/console-blog/2022/11/17/ask-the-experts-akilis-vision-for-equitable-benefit-in-digital-therapeutics)\nWhen evaluating health equity and overcoming social determinants, progress is typically measured by access to high quality healthcare. However, we believe that access alone - while an important first step - is not enough. At Akili, we are constantly exploring new ways to improve healthcare access while also ensuring that the treatments patients receive are effective.\n\nAs part of this vision, Akili recently launched Equitable Benefit (EB), a new program which will evaluate all Akili products and services based on their accessibility, use and benefit. The goal: to provide equitable benefit to all patients and caregivers using our products, regardless of their demographic background. We sat down with Carl Gottlieb, Chief Technology Officer and Andy Heusser, Senior Data Science Manager, to explore the EB program and Akili’s vision for equitable care.\n\nQ. What is Akili’s Equitable Benefit program?\n\nEquitable Benefit is a program that helps us create products and services that are equally beneficial to all patients, regardless of their demographic background or socioeconomic status.\n\nUnder the hood, EB is powered by advanced statistical software we built from the ground up to give us visibility into who has access to our products, who uses them, and who ultimately benefits from them.\n\nThis visibility allows us to understand how our decisions impact the equity of those using our products, and helps us prioritize choices that will have the largest positive impact for patients.\n\nQ. How is equitable benefit different from equitable access?\n\nPicture a student with access to best-in-class online course materials. Without the proper guidance, support and resources, they may never complete the course and consequently may never benefit from having access to these resources.\n\nTo truly unleash the potential of our most powerful digital technologies, we must actively invest in addressing inequalities. It is well known that health outcomes can depend on social determinants, like race, gender or income. The COVID-19 pandemic clearly highlights these inequities: Black and Latinx Americans are ~4x more likely to be hospitalized with complications from COVID-19 than non-Hispanic white people.1 To truly unleash the potential of our most powerful digital technologies, we must actively invest in addressing inequities. The goal of manufacturers should not be just to facilitate access, but should be to enable everyone to equitably benefit from the latest innovations.\n\nThe goal of manufacturers should not be just to facilitate access, but should be to enable everyone to equitably benefit from the latest innovations.\n\nTo accomplish this, we use EB to evaluate whether the demographics of those using our product are aligned with the populations we intend to serve. For example, our product EndeavorRx is indicated to improve attention in 8-12 year old children with primarily inattentive or combined type ADHD. (Please see endeavorrx.com for full indication information.) EB enables us to compare the demographics of the patients benefiting from our treatment with the broader population of children aged 8-12 with ADHD in the US with the goal of ensuring benefits are as equitable as possible across that population.\n\nQ. How can the equitable benefit assessment work for others?\n\nThe first step is collecting demographic data from those using the product, with their voluntary consent of course. We have an optional form when a caregiver and patient register for EndeavorRx after receiving a prescription that asks them to provide their demographic information.\n\nThe second step is to define your “target” audience: who is this product meant for? Without knowing the populations you’re trying to serve and support, it will be hard to determine who is benefiting from a product, and how.\n\nThe last step is to define the criteria for access, use and benefit. These definitions are completely up to the company. For Akili, “access” means anyone who activates a prescription for our product, “use” is the cohort that adheres to the treatment, and “benefit” is the group that has - hopefully - realized the attentional improvements based on the treatment. Benefit, for us, will always be a work in progress. As new patients begin using our product and others age into and out of our indication range, we always want to make sure that everyone is benefiting in the most equitable way.\n\nOnce these three pieces are in place, the software tools handle the rest using our proprietary framework. We generate internal quarterly reports on equitable access, use and benefit of our products and confidentially share them with internal business leaders to help them identify investment opportunities to improve equity in our patient base.\n\nWe’re excited to one day be able to share our learnings with other organizations who may be able to benefit from them as well, of course with proper consent and privacy protections in place for our users and customers.\n\nQ. How has the program been put into practice to date?\n\nIt’s best to answer this question with an example. Over the years, Akili has expanded from using iPadsⓇ exclusively to deliver treatment in our clinical trials, to expanding support to iPhonesⓇ, and then to the most commonly used AndroidTM devices in our commercial products.\n\nWe hypothesized that giving patients the option to “play their medicine” on less expensive, more generally-used devices would enable a more diverse population to benefit from our treatment. It turned out, however, that our hypothesis was only partially true. Patients accessing EndeavorRx from an iPhone were more diverse than those using an iPad (9% improvement in Equitable Access Score). However, the story is a little more complicated for Android patients. While Android enabled lower income families to access EndeavorRx, those patients tended to be disproportionately male. In other words, income equity increased but gender equity decreased which resulted in no change in our overall Equitable Access score (relative to iPad patients)."

It’s fascinating work to be a small part of.  One of the reasons I plan on staying for a while is the people who work here.  It would be difficult to find a more collaborative, positive, inclusive group of people, who genuinely love the work they do.  They support each other, regardless of the benefit to themselves or their specific skillset.  It’s also fun.  \r\n\r\nThe company goes out of it's way to offer above average benefits, compensation and employee appreciation with a creative bent. It is evident that a lot of work has gone into this.  How many times in your career can you say you’ve looked forward to coming into work every day?  For me, that is a motivating factor.  Companies talk about their “culture.”  This company works at building an environment that is setting us up for success.  This is a reflection on the carefully chosen leadership and the teams that they've built.  While all different in background and personality, this is a group of individuals that compliment one another in their intellectual abilities and personality traits.  Even the most dynamic people in this company are humble, no matter their level.  Leadership here is largely inclusive and goes above and beyond to offer support, to build up employees, helping them along on their career path.  I believe this is why the company is able to retain its people.    \r\n\r\nAkili is a continuous learning environment.  There's opportunity to learn every single day that we’re here.  There is no getting bored or feeling stagnated here.  There is opportunity to grow in your career and we are supported in continued education, networking, and clear set goals.  We have recently implemented a program to give substantive feedback more frequently. If you excel at Akili, there is career growth opportunity and stability.",

It would be difficult to find a more collaborative, positive, inclusive group of people, who genuinely love the work they do.  They support each other, regardless of the benefit to themselves or their specific skillset.  It’s also fun.  \r\n\r\nThe company goes out of it's way to offer above average benefits, compensation and employee appreciation with a creative bent. It is evident that a lot of work has gone into this.  How many times in your career can you say you’ve looked forward to coming into work every day?  For me, that is a motivating factor.  Companies talk about their “culture.”  This company works at building an environment that is setting us up for success.  This is a reflection on the carefully chosen leadership and the teams that they've built.  While all different in background and personality, this is a group of individuals that compliment one another in their intellectual abilities and personality traits.  Even the most dynamic people in this company are humble, no matter their level.  Leadership here is largely inclusive and goes above and beyond to offer support, to build up employees, helping them along on their career path.  I believe this is why the company is able to retain its people.    \r\n\r\nAkili is a continuous learning environment.  There's opportunity to learn every single day that we’re here.  There is no getting bored or feeling stagnated here.  There is opportunity to grow in your career and we are supported in continued education, networking, and clear set goals.  We have recently implemented a program to give substantive feedback more frequently. If you excel at Akili, there is career growth opportunity and stability.",

That is disingenuous, no one will want to work at a company they cannot trust.",

      "# [Akili, maker of a video game to treat ADHD, to be acquired for $34 million by Mario Aguilar on 2024-05-29](https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/virtual-therapeutics-acquire-akili-video-games-adhd/)\nA month after announcing it was seeking strategic alternatives, Akili Interactive, maker of a video game designed to treat ADHD, said it will go private in a merger with Virtual Therapeutics. The deal is expected to net Akili’s shareholders $34 million.\n\nAkili made headlines in 2020 when it received Food and Drug Administration clearance for EndeavorRx, a video game designed to treat pediatric ADHD. Akili went public in 2022 in a deal that valued the company at about $1 billion. But despite several strategic pivots, including shifting to direct-to-consumer sales, the company failed to build a sustainable business model. Akili in April announced it would wind down its existing commercial operations and focus on a licensing deal with Japanese pharma company Shionogi while it figured out the best path forward.\n\nadvertisement",
      "# [Two single arm trials of AKL-T01, a digital therapeutic for adolescents and adults with ADHD by Caitlin A, Deborah N, Raun D, Scott H on 2024-06-19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44184-024-00075-w)\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common pediatric psychiatric conditions, and with the recognition that symptoms often persist into adulthood1, rates of treatment seeking for adult ADHD have increased significantly in recent years2. These trends are echoed in the popular press, with particular attention toward increased rates of adult ADHD diagnoses and medication shortages highlighting a need for improved access to care3,4. Current treatments for ADHD have demonstrated incontrovertible short-term benefits across core symptoms and associated impairments5,6, but have limitations. Pharmacological treatments such as stimulant medications are associated with well-documented side effects, and they may not produce optimal benefits to certain cognitive domains7,8,9. Nonpharmacological interventions (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy) can be difficult to access, in part due to the limited number of qualified providers10,11. Moreover, since cognitive behavior therapy is not regulated, the quality and fidelity of the treatment in real world settings is not consistent with clinical trials supporting its efficacy. Adherence rates over time are generally low for existing standard of care treatment for ADHD, and longitudinal studies have shown that improvements are not maintained beyond 24–36 months12,13. While ADHD symptoms and functional impairment persist throughout adolescence and adulthood, medication use declines after age 11, and those who continue medication tend to do so inconsistently14,15.\n\nLimitations of front-line treatments underscore a need for innovation in the development of efficacious and scalable interventions for ADHD. Given the central role of attention and related cognitive processes in ADHD pathophysiology16, interventions that specifically target these constructs in safe and effective ways are critical. This is especially true as patients with ADHD move into adolescence and adulthood, with inattention becoming the predominant symptom domain endorsed in these age groups17. Computerized cognitive training (CCT) programs have been associated with improvements to working memory and executive functioning in ADHD populations18,19. Meta-analyses suggest non-significant evidence of far transfer (i.e., to impact ADHD symptoms; academic impairment) with CCT, and that evidence weakens with unblinded raters19. However, multi-component training models (i.e., CCT targeting multiple cognitive processes, and not just working memory) show promise, likely due to the heterogeneity of neuropsychological deficits in ADHD19. One such treatment, AKL-T01, is a novel digital therapeutic currently authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as EndeavorRx® (DEN200026)20. EndeavorRx is indicated to improve attentional functioning in children ages 8 to 12 years old with primarily inattentive or combined-presentation ADHD and demonstrated attentional impairment21. AKL-T01 is deployed on mobile devices (tablets and phones) and targets a range of processes implicated in attentional control through cognitive tasks in a videogame-based platform, using a staircase algorithm that personalizes level of difficulty to each individual.\n\nTwo pivotal clinical trials support the safety and efficacy of AKL-T01 for targeting inattention and clinical functioning in pediatric ADHD samples. The first, Software Treatment for Actively Reducing Severity of ADHD (STARS-ADHD), was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing AKL-T01 to a digital control in children 8–12 years old, diagnosed with ADHD, with impairment in objective attention function (as indicated by the Test of Variables of Attention [TOVA]-Attention Performance Index [API] ≤ −1.8), and not taking ADHD medication22. The AKL-T01 group demonstrated significantly greater improvements to attention on the TOVA-API compared to the active control group23. The second study, STARS-ADHD-Adjunctive, was a single-arm trial of AKL-T01 in children ages 8–14, both on and off stimulant medication. Comparable improvements were seen across the medication and non-medication cohorts in ADHD-related impairment and symptoms24. AKL-T01 demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with no serious adverse device effects and a relatively small number of mild to moderate adverse device events (ADEs) in both studies. Together, these trials suggest that AKL-T01 is safe and effective for children with ADHD, and that benefits to attentional functioning and functional impairment can be derived even among those actively participating in gold-standard treatment.\n\nGiven the rising demand for adult ADHD treatment2, the centrality of inattentive symptoms as patients age17, and the need for expanded access to evidence-based interventions for ADHD, an important question is whether similar benefits with AKL-T01 are observed in adolescents and adults with ADHD as in the pediatric population. In the present study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of AKL-T01 for improving objective attention and ADHD-related symptoms in two independent single-arm clinical trials with no comparison group, one in adolescents ages 13–17 (STARS-ADHD-Adolescent), and the other in adults ages 18 and older (STARS-ADHD-Adult). Since both of these studies were explicitly designed to demonstrate substantial equivalence as part of regulatory submissions, they did not include a comparison arm, as supported by regulatory guidance in CFR 806.7(c)(2). Additional information supporting the single-arm trial design, including an extensive discussion of placebo effects and sensitivity analyses, is contained in the Supplementary Materials: Single-Arm Trial.\n\nParticipants\n\nTable 1 contains detailed demographic characteristics for each trial.\n\nAdolescents\n\nOf 526 participants screened, 162 were enrolled between July 29, 2021 and September 1, 2022 (Fig. 1a) from across 13 sites (see Supplementary Materials: Poolability for post-hoc analyses supporting pooling data across sites). The most common reason for screen failure was a baseline score > −1.8 on the TOVA Attention Comparison Score (ACS; n = 314). All 162 enrolled were included in the Safety Population, 146 were included in the Efficacy Population, and 74 were included in the Per Protocol Population (see Methods for definitions). Fifteen participants (9.3%) discontinued the study. In the Efficacy Population, participants were predominantly male (58.9%), White (77.4%) and non-Hispanic/Latino (81.5%), with a mean age of 14.3 years (SD = 1.26). Approximately half (49.3%) reported current stimulant use, and 18.5% reported concurrent psychosocial treatment.\n\nAdults\n\nOf 440 participants screened, 221 participants were enrolled between November 29, 2021 and December 2, 2022 (Fig. 1b) from across 13 sites (see Supplementary Materials: Poolability for post-hoc analyses supporting pooling data across sites). The most common reason for screen failure was a baseline TOVA-ACS > −1.8 (n = 179). All 221 enrolled were included in the Safety Population, 153 were included in the Efficacy Population, and 96 were included in the Per Protocol Population. Seventy-five participants (34%) discontinued the study. In the Efficacy Population, participants were predominantly female (70%), White (77%) and non-Hispanic/Latino (85%), with a mean age of 39.9 years (SD = 12.84). Current stimulant use was reported by 39.2% of participants.\n\nCompliance\n\nAdolescents\n\nMean overall compliance in the Efficacy Population was 72.4%, with an average (SD) of 288 (169) minutes of treatment exposure over 84 (47) missions. Over half (57.5%) of participants in the Efficacy Population met the Per Protocol definition of a minimum of 60% treatment compliance.\n\nAdults\n\nMean overall compliance in the Efficacy Population was 81.1%, with an average (SD) of 530 (320) minutes of treatment exposure over 146 (86) missions. The majority (67.3%) of participants in the Efficacy Population met the Per Protocol definition of a minimum of 60% treatment compliance.\n\nAcross both studies, mean compliance trended downward slightly across study weeks, and this trend was consistent for all analysis populations and subgroups. See Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Table 6 for percent compliance by week.\n\nEfficacy\n\nAdolescents\n\nTOVA-ACS significantly improved from baseline to study day 28, with a mean increase of 2.64 (SD = 3.80), 95% CI [2.02, 3.26], t(145) = 8.40, p < 0.0001, d [95% CI] = 0.70 [0.54, 0.87] (Table 2). Post-hoc sensitivity analyses using Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests of change in TOVA-ACS from baseline to exit yielded similar results (p < 0.0001). Both secondary ADHD-Rating Scale-5 (ADHD-RS-5) endpoints also showed significant improvement from baseline to day 28: inattention subscale M change = −2.99 (SD = 5.38), 95% CI [−3.87, −2.10], t(144) = −6.69, p < 0.0001, d [95% CI] = 0.59 [0.41, 0.76]; total score M change = −4.59 (SD = 8.14), 95% CI [−5.93, −3.25], t(143) = −6.77, p < 0.0001, d [95% CI] = 0.50 [0.35, 0.65] (Table 3). There were no significant differences in any study outcomes between the subgroups who were or were not taking concomitant stimulant medication for TOVA-ACS (t[136.42] = −1.10, p = 0.272), ADHD-RS-5 inattention (t[141.77] = −0.28, p = 0.781), or ADHD-RS-5 total score (t[137.75] = 0.63, p = 0.528).\n\nAdults\n\nTOVA-ACS significantly improved from baseline to study day 42, with a mean increase of 6.46 (SD = 6.95), 95% CI [5.35, 7.57], t(152) = 11.49, p <0.0001, d [95% CI] = 0.86 [0.71, 1.01] (Table 2). Post-hoc sensitivity analyses using Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests of change in TOVA-ACS from baseline to exit yielded similar results (p < 0.0001). Both secondary ADHD-Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV) endpoints also showed significant improvement from baseline to day 42: inattention subscale M change = −5.10 (SD = 4.78), 95% CI [−5.86, −4.34], t(152) = −13.20, p < 0.0001, d [95% CI] = 1.56 [1.33, 1.80]; total score M change = −8.27 (SD = 7.74), 95% CI [−9.51, −7.04], t(152) = −13.23, p < 0.0001, d [95% CI] = 1.12 [0.95, 1.28]. Similarly, adults reported clinically significant improvements from baseline to day 42 on the Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS) ADHD index, M change = −4.30 (SD = 9.18), 95% CI [−5.77, −2.83], t(152) = −5.79, p <0.0001, d [95% CI] = 0.30 [0.15, 0.45], and in quality of life on the Adult ADHD Quality of Life (AAQoL), M change = 7.84 (SD = 13.75), 95% CI [5.64, 10.04], t(152) = 7.05, p <0.0001, d [95% CI] = 0.55 [0.40, 0.71]. There were no significant differences between the subgroups who were versus were not taking concomitant stimulant medication in change on the TOVA-ACS (t[104.21] = −1.21, p = 0.231), ADHD-RS-IV inattention (t[107.56] = 1.61, p = 0.111), ADHD-RS-IV total score (t[105.76] = 1.09, p = 0.277), or CAARS ADHD index (t[123.83] = −1.51, p = 0.133). Those in the stimulant group reported greater improvements in AAQoL from baseline to day 42 (M change = 10.66) relative to those not taking stimulants (M change = 6.02; t[120.82] = −2.03, p = 0.044), though this difference was non-significant after correction for multiple comparisons.\n\nResponder analysis\n\nAdolescents\n\nIn the Efficacy Population, 61.0% were responders based on a 1.4-point improvement on TOVA-ACS (60.8% in the Per Protocol Population), 24.7% were responders based on a TOVA-ACS ≥ 0 at exit visit (27.0% in the Per Protocol Population), and 27.1% were responders based on a ≥ 30% improvement in ADHD RS-5 total score (27.0% in the Per Protocol Population; Table 4).\n\nAdults\n\nIn the Efficacy Population, 83.0% were responders based on a 1.4-point improvement on the TOVA-ACS (84.4% in the Per Protocol Population), 36.6% were responders based on a TOVA-ACS ≥ 0 at exit visit (41.7% in the Per Protocol Population), 27.1% were responders based on a ≥ 30% improvement in ADHD RS-IV total score (34.4% in the Per Protocol Population), and 32.7% were responders based on a ≥ 8-point improvement on the AAQoL (44.8% in the Per Protocol Population).\n\nSafety results\n\nAdolescents\n\n4 participants (2.5%) experienced a treatment-emergent ADE (TE-ADE; Table 5), most commonly decreased frustration tolerance (1.9%) and headache (0.6%). No TE-ADEs were serious or resulted in study discontinuation, and no events were unanticipated as defined by the protocol.\n\nAdults\n\n11 participants (5%) experienced a TE-ADE (Table 6), most commonly nausea (1.8%) and headache (1.4%). No TE-ADEs were serious. 3 (1.4%) were unanticipated and resulted in study discontinuation; these TE-ADEs included headache (1 participant) and nausea (2 participants), and all were considered recovered/resolved after study treatment discontinuation.\n\nAcross the two clinical trials described, we evaluated the use of AKL-T01—which had previously been demonstrated effective in children ages 8–12 with ADHD23,24—for adolescents and adults with ADHD. Results provide preliminary support for the efficacy of AKL-T01; while the studies cannot be directly compared to prior work in younger children due to methodological differences, the magnitude of the effects of AKL-T01 in adolescents and adults was generally medium to large. Further, AKL-T01 was associated with benefits to ADHD-related symptoms across age groups and improvements to quality of life among adult participants, suggesting that treating inattention via video-game-based cognitive control training may translate to real-world benefits.\n\nIn the context of prior pediatric studies23,24, our results in adolescents and adults suggest that AKL-T01’s benefits to attentional functioning extend across the lifespan. Across both trials presented, participants demonstrated significant increases in TOVA-ACS. The TOVA is an objective measure of attentional functioning with low likelihood of expectation of benefit bias (i.e., placebo effect)22; supporting this, no placebo effect for TOVA was observed in the pediatric STARS trial that did include a control condition (see Supplementary Materials: Single-Arm Trial for further discussion of placebo effects). Notably, the magnitude of TOVA-ACS change became larger across age groups (adolescent M change = 2.64; adult M change = 6.46; Fig. 2). As previously stated, differences in trial methodology temper the ability to directly compare TOVA-ACS effects from these two trials to the prior pediatric RCT. However, considering within-treatment-group effect sizes, the greater improvements in attentional functioning observed in adolescents (nearly 3× higher) and adults (nearly 7x higher) relative to children may stem from differences across the populations in motivation and clinical characteristics. In terms of clinical characteristics, adults with ADHD are more likely to report inattentive symptoms17,25, which reflect the primary symptom domain targeted by AKL-T01. In contrast, medications targeting broad ADHD symptoms show similar effect sizes in children, adolescents, and adults9. Regarding motivation, whereas pediatric engagement with AKL-T01 is typically influenced by a caregiver, adults generally self-select into treatment and are therefore more likely to benefit from self-efficacy, a pivotal value in health behavior change26.\n\nAlong with objective attentional functioning, AKL-T01 was associated with benefits to ADHD symptoms across age groups, as measured by the ADHD-RS. The ADHD-RS is a clinician-administered measure that is widely used to assess ADHD symptoms in clinical trials with children, adolescents, and adults14,15,27. Relative to prior pediatric trials23,24, we observed ADHD-RS changes of larger magnitude in the adult data and slightly smaller changes in the adolescent data, though comparisons must be considered in the context of trial methodology differences. Given that participants in the adolescent trial had baseline scores indicating fewer symptoms at study start than in the STARS-ADHD pediatric trial, results suggest a similar relative effect of AKL-T01 on ADHD symptoms across studies. Additionally, in prespecified responder analyses, a comparable percentage of participants in each study (27%) achieved a 30% improvement in ADHD-RS total score, which is widely accepted as a minimal clinically important difference28. Given the evidence in the adult study that AKL-T01 was also associated with benefits to quality of life on the AAQoL, it will be important to similarly evaluate impacts to daily functioning in adolescents, which were not evaluated in the present report.\n\nA critical finding that emerged in the prior pediatric trials of AKL-T0123,24, and which is echoed in the adolescent and adult trials presented here, is that AKL-T01 appears to have comparable effects regardless of whether the patient is concomitantly treated with stimulant medication. Clinical guidelines support medication and cognitive-behavioral therapy as first-line interventions for the treatment of ADHD6. Our finding that patients taking stimulant medication seemed to benefit from AKL-T01 beyond their existing medication regimen aligns with evidence that multimodal treatment yields superior outcomes for ADHD symptoms and functional impairment29. The improvements across groups to attention and ADHD symptoms suggests that AKL-T01 is beneficial for patients with ADHD whose inattention is not currently well-controlled with stimulants, as well as those who do not include stimulant medication as part of their current ADHD treatment. It will be important to continue to evaluate potential differences in AKL-T01 treatment outcomes according to concomitant medication status with larger studies explicitly powered to detect potential subgroup differences, and geared toward understanding how the timing of stimulant medication use relative to AKL-T01 engagement may influence results.\n\nStrengths and limitations of the present study point to directions for future research. Strengths include relatively large samples, multisite trials, and a consistency of design across both studies that allowed for comparisons across the lifespan. One limitation of both trials presented here is the single-arm design, which tempers the strength of conclusions about clinical efficacy. The lack of change in TOVA-ACS in the active control group in the previously described pediatric RCT provides indirect evidence against a placebo effect (see also Fig. 2); whether the same holds true for adults and adolescents remains unknown (though see Supplementary Materials: Single-Arm Trial for justification of the single-arm trial design). While the single-arm trials cannot be directly compared to the pediatric RCT, the general magnitude of effects in adolescents and adults, which exceeded the previously reported effect of AKL-T01 in children by 2- to 7-fold, supports a beneficial impact of the intervention beyond regression to the mean or placebo effect. Given that rating scales may be more subject to placebo effects than the TOVA (e.g., if participants previously heard about the FDA clearance of EndeavorRx and had expectancy bias), it will be important for future studies to consider the impact of AKL-T01 on ADHD symptoms and quality of life relative to an active control. Another consideration is dropout, which was higher in the adult study than in the adolescent trial or prior pediatric trials, though comparable to dropout rates in recent ADHD medication trials30,31. Future studies should consider possible reasons for differential dropout rates (e.g., the longer duration of treatment in the adult study; parental accountability among adolescents). Additional studies to investigate longer term benefits of AKL-T01 in adults and adolescents are needed to determine whether AKL-T01 has lasting effects on attention and related processes. It will also be important to test the generalizability of the intervention’s effects to adults without TOVA-ACS impairment at baseline, and to understand predictors of response vs. non-response to treatment. Finally, future studies are needed to evaluate the minimum effective dose of AKL-T01, particularly to see if regimens involving a lower time commitment than the recommended 25 minutes per day, 5 days a week can lead to comparable outcomes.\n\nIn two independent trials in adolescents and adults with ADHD, AKL-T01 demonstrated a favorable safety profile and consistent clinical benefit, resulting in significant improvement in attention functioning, ADHD symptoms, and, in adults, quality of life. The magnitude of response was comparable to or larger than that of previous studies of this digital therapeutic, with particularly strong benefits in adults. Given the increased rates of treatment-seeking in adults with ADHD2, the significant barriers to accessing empirically-supported treatments10,11, and the centrality of inattentive symptoms as ADHD patients develop into adulthood28, AKL-T01 holds promise as a scalable, targeted treatment for inattention in adolescent and adult ADHD with evident impact on real-world symptoms. Consistent evidence across multiple trials supports the value of AKL-T01 for patients currently taking stimulant medications, in line with clinical guidelines supporting a multimodal treatment regimen that incorporates behavioral, pharmacological, and now digital interventions.\n\nOverview\n\nThe STARS-ADHD-Adolescent trial (NCT04897074) was a multicenter, single-arm, open-label study to evaluate objective attention functioning and ADHD symptoms in adolescents aged 13 to 17 years 10 months old, with a diagnosis of ADHD (combined or inattentive presentation), stably on or off ADHD medication, after 4 weeks of AKL-T01. The STARS-ADHD-Adult trial (NCT05183919) was a multicenter, single-arm, open-label study to evaluate objective attention functioning and ADHD symptoms and impairments in adults 18 years and older diagnosed with combined or inattentive ADHD, stably on or off ADHD medication, after 6 weeks of AKL-T01.\n\nThe trials were conducted in compliance with the Institutional Review Board (IRB) regulations stated in Title 21 of the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 56, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations and guidelines, and all applicable local regulations. The trials were approved by each site’s institutional review board (WIRB-Copernicus Group). Written informed consent (and assent for adolescents) was obtained from all participants and (for adolescents) their parent or legally authorized representative, respectively, and as appropriate given the participants’ ages. IRB-approved forms containing a detailed description of the study treatment, study procedures, and risks were provided to participants and (for the adolescent study) caregivers.\n\nStudy design\n\nThe STARS-ADHD-Adolescent study was designed to enroll up to 165 participants from up to 20 US-based sites. Study participation included a screening visit, a baseline visit (on-site; day 1), the 28-day treatment phase (at home; days 2 to 27), and an exit visit on day 28 ( ± 3 days; on-site). AKL-T01 treatment involved playing 6 to 8 missions of the game per day, for at least 5 days per week, for 4 consecutive weeks.\n\nThe STARS-ADHD-Adult study was initially designed to enroll up to 325 participants, with a minimum sample size of 301. An adaptive study design was adopted to enroll participants until the Standard Error (SE) of mean TOVA‑ACS change was ≤ 0.277, the threshold required to maintain 90% power to detect changes in the primary endpoint. However, the adult trial was discontinued prior to reaching the prespecified enrollment numbers for two primary reasons unrelated to safety or efficacy: First, the adolescent trial had demonstrated robust and meaningful effects that were larger than anticipated; second, projections based on enrollment rates indicated that the trial may not have reached completion with the target sample size until 2024. Although the stopping rule based on the target SE was not achieved, prespecified efficacy analyses yielded p-values < 0.000001 for primary and secondary outcomes necessary for making efficacy-related decisions. Study participation included a screening visit, a baseline visit (on site; study day 1), the 42‑day treatment phase (at home; days 2 to 42), and an exit visit on day 42 ( ± 3 days; on site). AKL-T01 treatment involved playing 6 to 8 missions per day, for at least 5 days per week, for 6 consecutive weeks, consistent with prior studies of this technology in adults32.\n\nParticipants\n\nFor STARS-ADHD-Adolescent, primary inclusion criteria were ages between 13 and 17 years, 10 months inclusive at the time of consent, and a diagnosis of ADHD combined or inattentive presentation, according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)5 as confirmed by MINI-Kid version 7.0.233. Participants were also required to have a demonstrated attentional impairment defined by TOVA-ACS ≤ −1.8. All participants had an IQ score ≥ 80 (as assessed by KBIT-II)34,35 and the absence of any medical condition that could impact study participation or potentially confound study assessments. Full study inclusion and exclusion criteria are available in Supplementary Table 7.\n\nMain inclusion criteria for STARS-ADHD-Adult were adults 18 years and older with a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD combined or inattentive presentation, according to DSM-55 as confirmed by the MINI for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorders Studies (Adult) version 7.0.236. Participants were also required to have a demonstrated attentional impairment defined by TOVA‑ACS ≤ −1.8 and ADHD RS‑IV ≥ 24. Full study inclusion and exclusion criteria are available in Supplementary Table 8.\n\nProcedures\n\nAt baseline, participants received an iPad Mini with AKL-T01 software and completed training to learn proper device and software usage.\n\nAt the screening and exit visits, participants were assessed via validated measures of cognitive functioning (TOVA) and clinical symptoms (see “Outcomes”). Participants were instructed to avoid caffeine for 4–6 hours prior to the visit. At the investigator’s discretion, participants may also have been instructed to delay that day’s ADHD medication until after completion of the TOVA at both screening and exit visits to avoid unintentional impact of ADHD medication on TOVA performance37.\n\nParticipants completed AKL-T01 treatment at home in combination with their previously established stable ADHD treatment regimen (which could include stimulant medications, other psychoactive medications, and nonpharmacological therapies), and keep their previously established treatment stable for 4+ weeks prior to enrollment and throughout the study. Recommended treatment with AKL-T01 involved playing 6 to 8 missions per day (approximately 25 min) for at least 5 days per week for 4 weeks (adolescents) or 6 weeks (adults). Compliance was monitored electronically, and the software generated automatic reminders to play. The treatment automatically locked after the allocated maximum number of daily missions, and no further play was permitted until the next calendar day.\n\nAny adverse device events (ADEs) occurring during any phase of the study judged by the principal investigator (PI) to be related to the intervention were recorded. If sites recorded mid-study discontinuation, they were required to indicate whether the discontinuation was due to an ADE or something else; if it was an ADE, then an ADE report was required. During the post-treatment visit, sites systematically collected data on whether participants reported any ADEs during the study period and, if so, completed an ADE report.\n\nIntervention\n\nAKL-T01 is a digital therapeutic built using a proprietary algorithm (Selective Stimulus Management Engine [SSME™]) designed to train interference management at an adaptive and personalized high degree of difficulty. Interference was instantiated through a video game-based interface displaying two tasks done in parallel (multitasking): a perceptual discrimination targeting task in which users responded to the stimulus targets and ignored the distractors (similar to a Go-No-Go task), and a sensory motor navigation task in which users continuously adjusted their location to interact with or avoid positional targets. Performance in each task was assessed during single and multitask conditions. As users proceeded through the treatment, periodic recalibration occurred to maintain an optimal difficulty level.\n\nOutcomes\n\nPrimary endpoints\n\nAll efficacy outcomes were prespecified unless otherwise indicated. The primary endpoint of both studies was change (study day 1 to study day 28 [adolescent] or day 42 [adult]) on the TOVA-ACS, which is a composite score of objective attentional functioning, with norms relative to both ADHD and non-clinical samples. The clinical cutoff on the ACS is zero, with scores below zero observed in samples with ADHD and scores above zero typical of non-clinical samples. Positive changes in the ACS indicate improvement in objective attentional functioning22.\n\nSecondary endpoints [adolescent]\n\nSecondary endpoints of the STARS-ADHD-Adolescent study were change (study day 1 to study day 28) in the ADHD RS-5 inattention scale and total scores. The ADHD RS-5 is a parent-reported, clinician-administered assessment of the child’s frequency of ADHD symptoms, consisting of 18 items rated on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (never or rarely) to 3 (very often). The inattention scale score is the sum of the 9 items that comprise the inattention scale, and the total score is the sum of all 18 items38. We also examined responder rates, defined in three ways: (1) a 1.4-point improvement on TOVA-ACS from baseline after 4 weeks of AKL-T01 [Note that in the original adolescent study protocol, a TOVA-ACS change greater than or equal to 1.0 was prespecified as indicating a responder; however, we revised the criterion post-hoc to a more stringent TOVA-ACS change of 1.4 to be consistent with the prespecified definition of a responder as TOVA change equal to or greater than 1.4 points in the original pediatric STARS RCT.], (2) TOVA-ACS ≥ 0 at exit visit (defined post-hoc), and (3) ≥ 30% improvement in ADHD RS-5 total score from baseline after 4 weeks of AKL-T01.\n\nSecondary endpoints [adult]\n\nSecondary endpoints of the STARS-ADHD-Adult study were change (study day 1 to study day 42) in the clinician-administered ADHD RS-IV with Adult Prompts inattention subscale and total scores after 6 weeks of treatment with AKL-T01. We also examined change in the self-reported Adult ADHD Quality of Life (AAQoL)39, change in the Conner’s Adult ADHD Rating Scale–Self-report: Short Version (CAARS-S:S)40, and responder rates, defined in four ways: (1) a 1.4-point improvement on TOVA-ACS from baseline after 6 weeks of AKL-T01, (2) TOVA-ACS ≥ 0 at exit visit (defined post-hoc), (3) ≥ 30% improvement in ADHD RS-IV total score from baseline after 6 weeks of AKL-T01, and (4) AAQoL ≥ 8 point improvement from baseline after 6 weeks of AKL-T01.\n\nCompliance\n\nPercent compliance was derived as the number of completed missions divided by the expected minimum number of completed missions multiplied by 100. The minimum expected number of completed missions was 30/week, or 120 total in the adolescent study and 180 total in the adult study. Percent compliance could greater than 100 because the expected number of completed missions was based on 6 missions/day, 5 days/week, but participants were given the opportunity to complete up to 8 missions/day and play up to 7 days/week.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nAll analyses were performed according to a prespecified analysis plan, unless indicated as post hoc. All analyses were conducted using a complete case analysis; no missing data were imputed.\n\nPower analysis\n\nSample size was calculated based on a zero-change from baseline in TOVA-ACS against the alternative of a positive change from baseline in TOVA-ACS with a one-sample t-test using EAST© version 6.5. For the adolescent trial, it was assumed that the TOVA-ACS SD (σ) in this population would be as large as observed with the pediatric population in the STARS-ADHD trial (SD = 3.2). The significance level was defined by a one-sided α at 0.025 and achievement of a minimum power of 90%. Assuming a previously observed control-corrected effect size of µ = 0.9 and observed σ = 3.2, a sample size of 135 was required to detect the effect with 90% power. To account for early discontinuation, planned enrollment was 150–165 participants. For the adult trial, it was assumed that due to greater heterogeneity in the adult ADHD population, the TOVA‑ACS σ would be 1.5 times that observed with pediatric populations (STARS‑ADHD), where the standard deviation was 3.2. Assuming σ = 4.8 and the previously observed control-corrected effect size of µ = 0.9, a sample size of 301 participants was required to detect the effect with 90% power. To account for early discontinuation, planned enrollment was 325 participants.\n\nAnalysis populations\n\nThe trials yielded three analysis populations. Safety analyses were conducted on the Safety Population, which included all exposed to AKL-T01. The Efficacy Population consisted of all participants who took AKL-T01 home and completed both baseline and end of study assessments. The Per Protocol population was the subset of the Efficacy Population that met the definition for “adequate dosage” or “minimum acceptable exposure” to the game. For adolescents, this was defined as completion of at least 60% of missions, equivalent to 72 of 120 missions (at least 6 missions/day × 5 days/week × 4 weeks), and having the day 28 exit visit occur between day 22 and day 34, inclusive. For adults, this was defined as completion of at least 60% of missions, equivalent to 108 of 180 missions (at least 6 missions/day × 5 days/week × 6 weeks), and having the day 42 exit visit occur between day 36 and day 48, inclusive.\n\nThe primary endpoint was change in TOVA-ACS, calculated as the score at day 28 (adolescent) or day 42 (adult) minus the score at baseline for each participant. A one-sample t-test (0.05 significance level) was used to test the null hypothesis that change from baseline equals 0. The samples were of sufficient size such that the test was robust to deviations from the normality assumption due to the central limit theorem. We also conducted post-hoc sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome for each study using non-parametric Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests of change in TOVA-ACS from baseline to exit. A similar set of t-tests was conducted for secondary endpoints. The familywise type 1 error rate for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints was 0.025 and was controlled using the fixed sequence method29. For responder analyses, responder rates were reported descriptively by number and percentage of patients meeting each response definition (see above). We also compared efficacy on primary and secondary endpoints across patients who were versus were not using concomitant stimulant medication. Note that while study participants could be taking other (i.e., non-stimulant) psychoactive medication, subgroup analyses are specifically based on concomitant stimulant use only.\n\nSafety endpoints summarized for the Safety Population included incidence, severity, and relationship to study treatment of treatment-emergent adverse device effects (TE-ADEs) and were reported overall and by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT)."
