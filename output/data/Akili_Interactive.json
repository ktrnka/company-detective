  "summary_markdown": "# About Akili Interactive\n\nAkili Interactive, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is a pioneering company in the digital therapeutics space. The company merges neuroscience with technology and video game entertainment to create innovative treatments for cognitive impairments. Akili's flagship product, **EndeavorRx**, is the first prescription video game treatment authorized by the FDA for pediatric ADHD. The company also offers **EndeavorOTC**, an over-the-counter version aimed at adults with ADHD.\n\nAkili operates primarily on a B2C model, targeting individuals with ADHD and their families. The company generates revenue through the sale of its digital therapeutic products, both prescription-based and over-the-counter. In 2023, Akili reported revenues of $1.7 million, with $1.2 million coming from EndeavorOTC and $523,000 from EndeavorRx [(Reuter & Taylor, MedTech Dive, 2024)](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/).\n\nThe company has faced significant challenges, including sluggish sales and financial losses, leading to multiple rounds of layoffs. As of early 2024, Akili's market cap has significantly declined, trading below $1 [(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)](https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/virtual-therapeutics-acquire-akili-video-games-adhd/).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\n- **Eddie Martucci**: Co-founder and CEO, instrumental in the development of EndeavorRx.\n- **Adam Gazzaley**: Founding Director of Neuroscape, a leading figure in cognitive neuroscience.\n- **Mary Hentges**: Board member with extensive experience in finance and corporate governance.\n- **Matt Franklin**: Current CEO, who has expressed optimism about the company's future, particularly in light of the upcoming merger with Virtual Therapeutics [(Business Wire, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-enter-120000485.html).\n\n# News\n\n## Acquisition by Virtual Therapeutics\nOn May 29, 2024, Akili announced a definitive agreement to be acquired by Virtual Therapeutics for approximately $34 million, translating to $0.4340 per share in cash. This acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024, pending certain conditions, including a majority of Akili shares being tendered [(Goodwin Law, 2024)](https://www.goodwinlaw.com/en/news-and-events/news/2024/05/announcements-lifesciences-ma-akili-interactive-to-be-acquired). Following the merger, Akili will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Virtual Therapeutics, which focuses on mental health solutions through immersive gaming [(Business Wire, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-enter-120000485.html).\n\n## Workforce Reductions\nIn April 2024, Akili announced it would lay off 46% of its workforce due to sluggish sales of its video game treatment for ADHD. This marked the third significant round of layoffs in less than a year, reflecting ongoing challenges in building a sustainable business model in the digital therapeutics space [(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)](https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/30/akili-interactive-digital-therapeutics-firm-announce-layoffs-restructuring/). The company has shifted its strategy to focus on over-the-counter sales of its products, including EndeavorOTC, which targets adults with ADHD [(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)](https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/virtual-therapeutics-acquire-akili-video-games-adhd/).\n\n## Financial Performance\nIn 2023, Akili reported revenues of $1.7 million, with $1.2 million coming from EndeavorOTC and $523,000 from EndeavorRx. However, the company also faced a net loss of $59.5 million for the year [(Reuter & Taylor, MedTech Dive, 2024)](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/). The financial struggles have been compounded by a significant drop in stock price, leading to a delisting notice from Nasdaq in October 2023 [(Reuter & Taylor, MedTech Dive, 2024)](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/).\n\n## Product Information\n### EndeavorRx\nEndeavorRx is a video game designed to improve attention function in children with ADHD. It received FDA clearance in 2020 and is delivered through a captivating gaming experience. The product is not intended to replace traditional medication but is designed to be used in conjunction with other treatments [(Walia, Boston Globe, 2024)](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/05/29/business/akili-interactive-merge-with-washington-based-virtual-therapeutics/). Akili has also developed EndeavorOTC, an over-the-counter version aimed at adults, which has shown better sales performance compared to its prescription counterpart [(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)](https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/virtual-therapeutics-acquire-akili-video-games-adhd/).\n\n### Clinical Validation\nAkili's products are backed by clinical trials, including a recent Phase III trial conducted in Japan, which demonstrated significant improvements in ADHD symptoms among pediatric patients using a localized version of EndeavorRx [(Tracy, PharmaExec, 2024)](https://www.pharmexec.com/view/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-strike-definitive-merger-agreement-seeking-to-improve-mental-health-through-immersive-video-games).

      "# [EndeavorRx® - ADHD Video Game Treatment for Kids on 2021-08-05](https://www.endeavorrx.com/#subscribe-to-email-list)\nEndeavorRx:\n\nIndications, Safety and Cautions\n\nIndications:\n\nEndeavorRx is a digital therapeutic indicated to improve attention function as measured by computer-based testing in children ages 8-17 years old with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD, who have a demonstrated attention issue. Patients who engage with EndeavorRx demonstrate improvements in a digitally assessed measure, Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA®), of sustained and selective attention and may not display benefits in typical behavioral symptoms, such as hyperactivity. EndeavorRx should be considered for use as part of a therapeutic program that may include clinician-directed therapy, medication, and/or educational programs, which further address symptoms of the disorder.\n\nSafety:\n\nNo serious adverse events were reported. Of 342 participants who received AKL-T01 in the two clinical trials supporting EndeavorRx authorization for age ranges 8-17, 17 participants (4.97%) experienced treatment-related adverse events (TE-ADE) (possible, probable, likely). TE-ADEs reported at greater than 1% across the studies include: frustration tolerance decreased (2.34%) and headache (1.17%). Other adverse events occurred less than 1% and included dizziness, emotional disorder, nausea, and aggression. All adverse events were transient and no events led to device discontinuation. Across other studies in children and adolescents with ADHD, rates of adverse events were similarly low (<10%) and no Serious Adverse Events have been reported. All reported adverse events across all clinical trials resolved at the end of treatment. Users should consider the totality of evidence presented along with their health care provider when considering incorporating AKL-T01 into their treatment plan.\n\nCautions:\n\nRx only: Federal law restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a licensed health care provider. EndeavorRx should only be used by the patient for whom the prescription was written. For medical questions, please contact your child’s healthcare provider. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, please dial 911. EndeavorRx is not intended to be used as a stand-alone therapeutic and is not a substitution for your child’s medication.\n\nIf your child experiences frustration, emotional reaction, dizziness, nausea, headache, eye-strain, or joint pain while playing EndeavorRx pause the treatment. If the problem persists contact your child’s healthcare provider. If your child experiences a seizure stop the treatment and contact your child’s healthcare provider.\n\nEndeavorRx may not be appropriate for patients with photo-sensitive epilepsy, color blindness, or physical limitations that restrict use of a mobile device; parents should consult with their child’s healthcare provider.\n\nPlease follow all of your mobile device manufacturer’s instructions for the safe operation of your mobile device. For example, this may include appropriate volume settings, proper battery charging, not operating the device if damaged, and proper device disposal.

      "# [ADHD in The Workplace — Akili Interactive](https://www.akiliinteractive.com/workplacesurvey)\nEmployees with ADHD are navigating their careers with intention, but a lack of adequate support. To cultivate an inclusive and thriving work environment, companies must transcend conventional approaches and provide better guidance for managers, and more comprehensive support for employees. These insights emerge from the new ADHD in the Workplace Study conducted by Akili and Wakefield Research, shedding light on the need and opportunity for ADHD accommodations at work to maximize the potential of a neurodiverse workforce.\n\nInformation was collected from US employed adults¹: 500 US employed adults with ADHD and 500 US managers (with or without ADHD), to understand the everyday challenges and experiences of those with ADHD at work. The survey covered the impact of impairment, disclosure to employers, experiences of stigma, manager misconceptions, treatment options, and more.\n\nThe research revealed that employees with ADHD face compounding challenges at work that can sidetrack career goals and take a toll on mental health.\n\n87% of employees with ADHD report experiencing a negative impact of ADHD on their career\n\n97% feel they would be capable of accomplishing more if they could better manage their symptoms.\n\n95% feel limited by the number of treatment options available to them.\n\nEmployees with ADHD are seeking a more nuanced understanding and awareness from their supervisors of their strengths and needs for additional support, but managers feel unequipped to fully provide that support. Namely, 81% of managers report that they don’t feel completely prepared to appropriately address employee needs if an employee discloses an ADHD diagnosis.\n\nIf companies don’t take action to support their employees with ADHD, they run the risk of driving these employees away, with additional impacts on engagement and productivity. In light of the ongoing stimulant medication shortage (see FDA-DEA letter 2023), it has become even more urgent to support employees with adequate and varied resources. The report explores how companies should enhance their training for managers on workplace resources and benefits, as well as provide more treatment options for employees with ADHD. Akili has expanded options available with the launch of EndeavorOTC.\n\nThe Impact of Misconceptions about ADHD in the Workplace\n\nIn today’s workplace, misconceptions about ADHD abound.\n\n92% of employees believe that their colleagues hold misconceptions about ADHD, the most common of which is “people with ADHD just need to try harder”\n\n75% of employees with ADHD report experiencing increased micromanagement by supervisors relative to their peers\n\n56% believe their condition has specifically led them to being demoted, overlooked for promotions, or their job responsibilities being taken away\n\nThis figure jumps to 65% for parents with ADHD, highlighting the varied challenges of those with multiple home and work responsibilities\n\nBeyond Misconceptions: The Daily Realities of ADHD in the Workplace\n\nWhile misconceptions about ADHD serve to hinder employees with ADHD, the genuine challenges posed by ADHD symptoms also impact daily work experiences.\n\nNearly 2 in 3 (65%) of employees with ADHD say that accomplishing day-to-day work tasks while managing ADHD symptoms poses a moderate to significant challenge\n\n54% say they’re getting by, but would need more support to reach their full potential\n\n19% say they are barely getting by and really need additional support.\n\nThe most prevalent symptoms include being easily distracted or sidetracked, with 59% of employees with ADHD citing this as a primary concern, followed by 56% who report a lack of focus and engagement at work. These struggles are not limited to challenges with focusing attention, as 32% of employees report difficulty building relationships with colleagues. Gender nuances emerge in this context as well. Overall women reported more symptoms on average than men (4.6 symptoms vs. 4.0 symptoms).\n\nADHD takes a toll on employees in multiple ways, and 88% of employees with ADHD report that the stimulant shortage has further impacted their work. The vast majority of employees with ADHD (90%) describe errors, conflicts, or extra hours at work as a result of challenges managing their ADHD. Nearly half (46%) have missed a deadline or meeting. In addition, employees have duplicated work that had already been done (31%), sent incorrect information to a boss or client (31%) or missed work altogether (31%) as a result of challenges managing their ADHD.\n\nThis is consistent with previous research finding that employees with ADHD may lose an average of 29 days of productivity per year in the US as compared to their colleagues without ADHD.\n\nFurthermore, unmanaged ADHD symptoms can also be a reinforcing cycle, as 44% of employees with ADHD report that challenges managing their symptoms have caused them to feel unmotivated. Additionally 71% have reported it has led to them feeling anxious and 40% have reported it has led to them feeling depressed, further adding to the burden of the disorder.\n\nOn the other hand, nearly all employees with ADHD (98%) recognize that there are positive aspects of their ADHD that have helped them at work including increased creativity (51%), ability to think outside the box (49%), and higher levels of empathy (46%). Tapping into these strengths can be a powerful way to enhance workplace satisfaction, engagement and outcomes.\n\nFor managers, there appears to be a high level of familiarity with ADHD in general, with 83% of managers reporting that they are very or extremely familiar with ADHD. Of the managers surveyed, 21% report personally having ADHD. While this could be due to selection bias, it may also be that there are high levels of people with ADHD in management positions relative to the overall prevalence. Additionally, 74% of managers know someone at a current or previous job with ADHD and 37% directly supervised someone that they believed or confirmed had an ADHD diagnosis. While these numbers are encouraging, awareness is not the same as understanding how best to help.\n\nIn fact, 59% of managers report that they don’t feel completely prepared to appropriately respond if an employee tells them that they have ADHD. This gap between awareness and preparation underscores the need for more comprehensive training and education for managers.\n\nThe Value of Support\n\nFor employees diagnosed with ADHD, understanding and support from their employers and direct supervisors often take precedence over other workplace factors. 93% of employees with ADHD rate having a supervisor who knows how to support and work with them as more valuable than any office perk. When telling a supervisor about their ADHD, employees are looking for both practical support from supervisors on their working styles as well as additional workplace resources. For example, 55% of employees hope to gain acceptance of how their work style may differ from that of their colleagues and 24% are hoping for workplace resources.\n\nThe lack of training and resources has a direct impact on companies’ abilities to retain talent. For nearly half of employees with ADHD (45%), the challenges they experience in managing their symptoms at their current job have caused them to search for a new one or to consider doing so with nearly 1 in 10 (9%) already looking for a new position. This is especially true for younger generations – 62% of Gen Z and 57% of Millennials reported looking for, or planning to look for, a new job specifically because of challenges related to their ADHD (compared to 45% of Gen X and 26% of Boomers).\n\nRecommendations\n\nEmployees | For employees, there is a clearly expressed need for both acceptance of one’s own unique working style and additional tools and resources. Acceptance can start with a recognition of one’s own strengths and thinking about ways to shape your work tasks to fit your own learning style. This could involve identifying tasks that are energizing and that you are able to focus on and brainstorm ways to incorporate more of them into your day or intersperse them between more boring tasks. It may also involve tasks that involve higher stress, pressure or mental challenge (this can be a superpower!), novel or varied tasks, hands-on work, and/or topics of personal interest. As a next step, it can be helpful to develop a system of organization that complements your cognitive style, and to build your attentional control by engaging in specific cognitive activities designed to target and strengthen mental processes needed for attention.\n\nThe next set of strategies is based on communicating a need for support from others. When talking with a coworker or supervisor about having ADHD, think about your goal in telling them. Is it so others will better understand? For support? Figuring out how to better work together? Knowing the purpose will help guide the conversation. Based on your goal, share relevant information, whether it’s basic info or misconceptions about ADHD or more personally relevant experiences and strengths. Then you can discuss strategies and/or ask for support. The other person will likely ask questions, to think about how you’d like to respond. Ultimately, deciding whether or not to talk with coworkers or a supervisor about having ADHD is a personal decision. Guidance from a mental health professional or coach can be helpful in weighing the considerations and preparing for a conversation.\n\nManagers | Managers can help by creating an environment of psychological safety, where employees feel comfortable talking about their ADHD diagnosis and how they can best be supported. These conversations should not be forced on employees, but instead made clear that they are welcome without putting anyone on the spot. Furthermore, studies have shown that individuals with ADHD may find workplace accommodations to be helpful including reduction of auditory distractions, and managers who provide organization advice, clear delegation of tasks and clearly defined roles, or extra reminders about due dates. It’s important to remember that not all individuals want these accommodations, however. The most important thing is not to make assumptions and instead to talk to the individual in order to understand their particular needs.\n\nCompanies | In order to retain talent, minimize losses to productivity and create an environment where employees feel engaged and have the opportunity to thrive, there is a deep need for additional resources and training. Employers can provide educational materials about ADHD for all of their employees and can provide manager-specific trainings on topics such as “How to Create and Environment of Psychological Safety,” “How to Become Aware of (and Address) Our Own Biases” and “How to Provide Resources and Support for Employees with ADHD.” They can recognize the strengths of employees with ADHD diagnoses and support these employees in reaching their potential for the benefit of these employees and the company. Employers should also check benefits to make sure they are not arbitrarily excluding coverage for adults with ADHD, and consider additional benefits and resources in order to enable employees to work at their best.\n\nWith increased awareness of the gaps in supporting employees with ADHD in the workplace comes the urgent need to address these gaps through education, training and resources so as to unlock the potential of a neurodiverse workforce.\n\nTo learn more about a new kind of treatment option available for adults with ADHD:",

(Akili) pursuant to California Health and Safety Codes §§119400-119402 (Code) which requires pharmaceutical companies and certain medical device companies to make available their comprehensive compliance program and an annual written declaration of compliance with their compliance program.\n\nAkili is committed to conducting business in a manner which is built on trust and adherence to the highest ethical standards. Accordingly, we have built a compliance program that is based on the 2003 United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General publication “Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers.” Our compliance program is also informed by the AdvaMed “Code of Ethics on Interactions with U.S. Health Care Professionals,” as our company manufactures and produces a prescription digital therapeutic that has certain characteristics similar to a medical device. The AdvaMed Code is similar to the PhRMA Code but is tailored to serve the needs and interactions that a medical device company may have with a healthcare professional. Our compliance program is tailored to our size, organizational structure, available resources, and the nature of our business.\n\nAkili has set its annual dollar limit on gifts, promotional materials, or other items and activities that may be provided to a healthcare professional at $2,000. The dollar limit is a maximum only. This does not include fair market value payments that may be made for bona fide professional services including, but not limited to, serving on an advisory board, serving as a speaker, or performing other consulting services. This limit also does not include samples or free trials that may be provided or financial support for continuing medical education or other educational support.\n\nAkili declares that, to the best of our knowledge, and based on our understanding of the Code, we are in compliance with our compliance program and the Code.\n\nA written declaration of compliance may be obtained by calling 857-254-3367.\n\nOverview of Akili’s Compliance Program\n\nI. Written Policies and Procedures\n\nAkili has written policies and procedures that are the backbone of its compliance program.

Akili also maintains a third-party maintained hotline which allows employees to report anonymously.\n\nV. Monitoring and Auditing\n\nAkili’s compliance program includes regular monitoring and auditing activities as needed and at the direction of the Chief Compliance Officer and the Compliance Committee.\n\nVI. Disciplinary Guidelines\n\nAkili has disciplinary guidelines that have been published for all employees to read and understand. The Company ensures all disciplinary action, as it occurs, is in alignment with these guidelines.\n\nVII.

There are a few answers to this, I'll share what I can \"publicly\": \n\n1. The OTC/Adult product will continue to have more and more features that are bespoke for an adult experience. The pediatric/child experience ultimately separates into two products, one that is just the treatment/game and one that includes analytics (cognitive metrics and compliance) and tools & tips for caregivers so they can help their child have the best possible success with the treatment. \n   1. This will be true of product strategy moving forward; what a child + caregiver need in the experience of the treatment is not what an adult needs. And because we work directly with the regulatory governing bodies as a medical product, our products need to clear patient age indications and instructions for use. \n2. Both Rx and OTC are regulatory filings with the FDA, and they are different regulatory filings. We [publicly announced recently t](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230913220525/en/Akili-Announces-Business-Transformation-Focusing-on-Non-prescription-Model)hat we'd continue moving towards an OTC/direct-to-consumer model because it better puts the treatment decision-making in the hands of the consumer (with hopefully support from their HCPs.) There are actually a great number of differences between distributing an Rx and an OTC, so at the present time, the pediatric products and adult product have different distribution paths. \n   1. If you are wondering why the pediatric products are not available OTC, it will just take some time. It requires an updated filing and authorization with the FDA to transition a product from Rx to OTC. \n\nHope that helps! Happy to answer any more questions!\n\n### Comment ID k5owzcw with +2 score by [(sheilag33, Reddit, 2023-10-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/endeavorotc/comments/17biizu/otc_vs_rx/k5owzcw/) (in reply to ID k5ko51r):\nThank you for the quick reply Catella!\n\n#### Comment ID k5pkzqo with +1 score by [(catella18, Reddit, 2023-10-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/endeavorotc/comments/17biizu/otc_vs_rx/k5pkzqo/) (in reply to ID k5owzcw):\nOf course!\n\n### Comment ID k6qwk0u with +1 score by [(Want-to-refresh, Reddit, 2023-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/endeavorotc/comments/17biizu/otc_vs_rx/k6qwk0u/) (in reply to ID k5ko51r):\nThanks for the explanation.

The announcement comes ahead of the company’s first-quarter earnings release on May 14.\n\nAkili’s hunt for options follows dismal outcomes for other digital therapeutics companies that have thrown in the towel after failing to build sustainable businesses. Earlier this year, Better Therapeutics, developer of an FDA-cleared app for the treatment of type 2 diabetes shut down operations. And almost exactly a year ago, Pear Therapeutics sold off its assets at bankruptcy auction.\n\nadvertisement",

The deal is expected to net Akili’s shareholders $34 million.\n\nAkili made headlines in 2020 when it received Food and Drug Administration clearance for EndeavorRx, a video game designed to treat pediatric ADHD. Akili went public in 2022 in a deal that valued the company at about $1 billion. But despite several strategic pivots, including shifting to direct-to-consumer sales, the company failed to build a sustainable business model. Akili in April announced it would wind down its existing commercial operations and focus on a licensing deal with Japanese pharma company Shionogi while it figured out the best path forward.\n\nadvertisement",
      "# [Digital therapeutics firm Akili to sell for $34M by Elise Reuter, Nick Paul Taylor on 2024-05-30](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/)\nDive Brief:\n\nAkili, a company that makes a video game treatment for ADHD, will sell to Virtual Therapeutics for about $34 million, according to a Wednesday regulatory filing.\n\nThe two companies will merge into a larger digital health firm, with Akili operating as a subsidiary of Virtual Therapeutics.\n\nAkili received Food and Drug Administration clearance in 2020 for a prescription game to improve attention in children with ADHD. But, after rounds of layoffs, the company shifted away from the prescription model last year and began exploring strategic alternatives in April.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAkili was one of a few companies that sought to develop prescription apps, called digital therapeutics, that have received the FDA’s blessing and would be covered by insurers. Boston-based Akili achieved the first milestone when it received de novo clearance for its game for children to improve ADHD symptoms, called EndeavorRx. However, it struggled to find payers willing to cover the product.\n\nAkili went public through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company in 2022. It received a delisting notice from Nasdaq in October, and its shares have traded below $1 since the start of 2024.\n\nThe company cut nearly a third of its staff in January 2023 and went through another round of layoffs later that year. In September, Akili announced it would restructure its business to no longer focus on prescriptions. Akili started selling an over-the-counter version of its ADHD treatment for adults, thanks to pandemic flexibilities on certain digital health products, and planned to seek FDA clearance to sell both the adult and pediatric versions over the counter.\n\nThe over-the-counter product brought more money to Akili than the prescription version, but the company’s expenses still surpassed its earnings.\n\nIn 2023, the company brought in $1.7 million in revenue, with $1.2 million from EndeavorOTC and $523,000 from EndeavorRx. Akili reported a $59.5 million net loss last year.\n\nIn April, Akili cut 46% of its workforce, including axing its marketing and medical affairs teams, and began looking into strategic alternatives. It also struck an agreement with Japanese pharmaceutical company Shionogi to forgive a $5 million debt obligation and pay $10.5 million upfront for a version of EndeavorRx sold in Japan in exchange for eliminating future royalty and milestone payments.\n\nVirtual Therapeutics will make a cash tender offer of 43 cents per share to buy Akili.

      "# [Digital therapeutics firm Akili agrees $34 million takeover on 2024-05-30](https://pharmaphorum.com/news/digital-therapeutics-firm-akili-agrees-34-million-takeover)\nIn another deal that highlights the pressures facing companies in the digital health sector, Akili Interactive has agreed to go private in a merger with Virtual Therapeutics.\n\nThe announcement comes just weeks after Akili said it was seeking strategic alternatives for its business, which focuses on game-like digital therapeutics (DTx) for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nAkili went public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2022 that raised around $163 million and briefly elevated its value above the $1 billion mark, before swiftly falling back below the $200 million mark. It is now trading just above $0.40, with a market cap of $33 million.\n\nThe company initially focused on a business strategy based on its EndeavorRx prescription DTx aimed at children with ADHD – one of the first DTx to get FDA approval - but failed to gain traction commercially. Last year, it changed tack to also focus on direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales of the software to adults with ADHD under the EndeavorOTC brand.\n\nThe move brought in some sales growth and the company has also taken steps to reduce losses with job cuts and other cost-saving measures. However, in its last quarterly update, revenues were still low at $383,000 and Akili recorded an operating loss of almost $11 million. On the plus side, it has paid down its debt and was still sitting on cash reserves of $63 million, down from $75 million at the end of 2023.\n\nVirtual – which focuses on the development of game-like software for mental health disorders – has offered just over 43 cents per share for Akili, slightly above its closing share price before the deal was announced, but 85% above the price before it announced the strategic review of its business at the end of April.\n\nAs its name suggests, Virtual’s focus is on virtual reality (VR) software. Its two main products are Breakthrough, a mental fitness training app aimed at businesses that promises to reduce stress and burnout and fight “quiet quitting”, and attention-training and meditation app Bloom.\n\nIn a statement, the two companies said the merger would create a “diversified, leading digital health company” that will operate under the Virtual Therapeutics name, with Akili operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary.\n\n“The team at Akili has been successful in applying clinical and scientific rigour to bring new products forward, and we believe their expertise will complement our efforts,” said Virtual’s co-founder and chief executive, Dan Elenbas.\n\n“Together, we can build a company that brings these behavioural services to as many patients as possible – regardless of where they are or barriers that exist for them today.”\n\nAkili’s absorption into Virtual is further evidence of the struggles that digital health companies which blossomed during COVID-19 lockdowns have faced trying to build sustainable businesses, even with FDA-approved DTx.\n\nThe merger comes just a few days after the assets of another digital health pioneer – Better Therapeutics – were sold to Click Therapeutics after it shut down operations, three years after its own IPO. Click also bought some of the assets of Pear Therapeutics, another DTx developer that went down the IPO route, but filed for bankruptcy last year.",

      "# [Virtual Therapeutics, Akili Interactive Strike Definitive Merger Agreement Seeking to Improve Mental Health Through Immersive Video Games by Don Tracy, Associate Editor on 2024-05-31](https://www.pharmexec.com/view/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-strike-definitive-merger-agreement-seeking-to-improve-mental-health-through-immersive-video-games)\nVirtual Therapeutics and Akili, Inc. announced that they have agreed to terms on a definitive merger agreement, aiming to establish a digital health company that creates engaging and immersive games to improve mental health. Under terms of the merger, Akili will now work as a wholly owned company of Virtual Therapeutics, Akili shareholders will receive $0.4340 per share of common stock in cash, representing a 4% premium to the closing stock price.1\n\n“In today’s global mental health crisis, patients deserve access to clinically validated solutions that address their specific needs. We have been able to advance multiple solutions on our platform since founding Virtual Therapeutics, and we look forward to taking a significant step forward through this merger,” said Dan Elenbaas, co-founder, CEO, Virtual Therapeutics, in a press release. “The team at Akili has been successful in applying clinical and scientific rigor to bring new products forward, and we believe their expertise will complement our efforts. Together, we can build a company that brings these behavioral services to as many patients as possible—regardless of where they are or barriers that exist for them today.”\n\nIn February, Akili announced promising results from a Phase III clinical trial conducted by its partner Shionogi & Co. Ltd, for STD-001, a localized version of EndeavorRx, Akili’s prescription digital therapeutic indicated to improve attentional functioning in pediatric patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). EndeavorRx was previously authorized by the FDA for patients aged 8 to 17 years with ADHD.\n\nAs part of the trial, 164 pediatric patients with ADHD aged 6 to 17 years who received environmental adjustments and psychosocial therapies were evaluated for 25 minutes a day over six weeks. According to the company, the group displayed major improvements in the change from baseline in the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) Inattention score compared to the control group (continuing conventional treatments) after six weeks.2\n\n“The latest Japanese clinical trial of our patented, clinically proven technology is an important milestone for many reasons,” said Scott Kollins, chief medical officer, Akili, in a press release. “It not only further validates the efficacy and safety of EndeavorRx, it also moves us and our international partner SHIONOGI a step closer to making the product available in Japan. And if approved in Japan, it will provide an effective and safe option in a country where some front-line pharmaceutical therapies are not as widely available to pediatric patients with ADHD.”\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than one in five people live with a mental illness in the United States, with one in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression. There are several causes of mental illness, such as trauma or a history of abuse, use of drugs and alcohol, chemical imbalances in the brain, and feelings of loneliness or isolation.3\n\n“Akili ran a thorough strategic process, and we believe that this transaction represents Akili’s commitment to delivering value to the Akili stockholder,” said Matt Franklin, CEO, Akili, in the press release. “Virtual Therapeutics has been built by a team with decades of success in the gaming industry and elected to focus their expertise to help solve the growing mental health crisis. Combining our proven track record developing and deploying rigorously validated mobile digital therapeutics with Virtual Therapeutics’ robust portfolio of VR-based mental health solutions and gaming expertise, we aim to create a compelling platform to address mental health needs across several high-impact indications.”\n\nReferences\n\n1.

      "# [Shionogi takes Akili’s ADHD digital therapy to Japan on 2024-02-27](https://pharmaphorum.com/news/shionogi-takes-akilis-adhd-digital-therapy-japan)\nDigital health company Akili is on the brink of its first major expansion beyond the US, partnering with Shionogi to file a localised version of its attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) therapy for approval in Japan.\n\nThe game-based digital therapeutic (DTx) has been filed for approval with Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW) as a prescription treatment for ADHD based on a clinical trial, carried out in Japanese children aged six to 17, which showed statistically significant improvements in attention and hyperactivity/impulsivity.\n\nAkili notes that Japan could be an important market for the EndeavorRx spinoff, called SDT-001, as access is restricted to many of the drugs used to treat ADHD in the US. That includes most medicines based on stimulants, such as amphetamine salts, although non-stimulant drugs like methylphenidate are available.\n\n“If approved in Japan, it will provide an effective and safe option in a country where some front-line pharmaceutical therapies are not as widely available to paediatric patients with ADHD,” said Dr Scott Kollins, Akili’s chief medical officer.\n\nThe prevalence of ADHD has been estimated to be lower in Japan than in North America, at around 0.4% versus 5.3% according to one study, although that could be down to variations in diagnosis and there is some evidence that case numbers have been rising.\n\nThe Japanese trial was carried out by Shionogi and was a phase 3 study, enrolling 164 children with ADHD who were being treated with conventional treatments, including environmental adjustments and psychosocial therapies.\n\nThose randomised to 25-minute daily use of SDT-001 for six weeks saw statistically significant improvements in the change from baseline in the ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) Inattention score compared to a control group at the end of that period, the study’s primary endpoint, said Akili.\n\nThat was accompanied by significant improvements in the change from baseline in the total ADHD-RS-IV score and the hyperactivity/impulsivity score at the same time point, and the benefit was sustained after a second six-week treatment cycle, according to the company.\n\nShionogi is an established player in the Japanese ADHD market with Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate), one of the only stimulant drugs approved for use by the MHLW- although, since 2020, it has been subject to a 30-day prescription limit.\n\nIt partnered with Akili in 2019 to bring DTx for ADHD and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to the Japanese market in a deal that included an upfront payment of $10 million and up to $105 million in development and commercial milestones.\n\nThe move into Japan comes as Akili has modified its business strategy in the US, with the launch of an over-the-counter version of EndeavorRx, aimed at treating ADHD in adults, in a move that recognised the challenges in building a sustainable prescription DTx business.",
      "# [Products — Akili Interactive](https://www.akiliinteractive.com/products)\nOf 538 participants using EndeavorRx in clinical studies, 50 participants (9.3%) experienced treatment-related adverse events including frustration, headache, dizziness, emotional reaction, nausea, and aggression. There were no serious adverse events reported.\n\nEndeavorRx is only available through a licensed health care provider. It is not intended to be used as a stand-alone therapeutic and is not a substitution for a child’s medication. EndeavorRx may not be appropriate for patients with photo-sensitive epilepsy, color blindness, or physical limitations that restrict use of a mobile device; parents should consult with their child’s health care provider.\n\nFamilies should contact their child’s health care provider and review the important indications, safety and caution information in the Instructions for Use before using the EndeavorRx treatment.",

      "# [Virtual Therapeutics completes acquisition of Akili by Sean Whooley on 2024-07-02](https://www.massdevice.com/virtual-therapeutics-acquires-akili/)\nVirtual Therapeutics announced today that it completed the tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Akili (Nasdaq:AKLI).\n\nThe company initially commenced its tender offer at a price of $0.4340 per share on June 3. It expired at one minute after 11:59 p.m. EDT on July 1. As of the expiration date, nearly 70 million shares (88.2% of Akili’s outstanding shares) were validly tendered.\n\nFollowing the completion of this offer, Virtual Therapeutics plans for its Alpha Merger Sub subsidiary to merge with Akili today, July 2. As a result, Akili will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Virtual Therapeutics.\n\nAkili develops the EndeavorRx video game for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The prescription treatment is delivered through a video game experience as a way to improve attention function as measured by computer-based testing.\n\nVirtual Therapeutics develops digital health solutions for mental health and mental fitness, leveraging game development expertise. It combines modern gameplay mechanisms with proven therapeutic techniques.\n\n“The completion of this acquisition provides a foundation for us to build a leading digital health company that is capable of bringing new behavioral services to as many patients as possible,” said Dan Elenbaas, co-founder and CEO of Virtual Therapeutics. “We look forward to leveraging Akili’s expertise and strengths as we embark on this next stage of growth for Virtual Therapeutics.”\n\nHow Akili got to this point\n\nThe company hit some snags over the past year or so, reflecting a potential trend in the digital therapeutics space. Fellow DTX companies also struggled, with Better Therapeutics ceasing operations in March, then selling its assets in May. Pear Therapeutics similarly scaled down operations after filing bankruptcy last year.\n\nAkili, meanwhile, shifted toward a non-prescription business model with over-the-counter offerings last year, reducing its workforce by approximately 40%. That included the elimination of the company’s field sales force and market access team.",

      "# [Akili Cuts 46% of Staff, Explores Strategic Options by Morgan Gonzales on 2024-05-01](https://bhbusiness.com/2024/05/01/akili-cuts-46-of-staff-explores-strategic-options/)\nPrescription digital therapeutics company Akili, Inc. (Nasdaq: AKLI) announced another workforce reduction, terminating nearly half of its remaining employees.\n\nThe layoffs, which amount to 46% of Akili’s workforce, will eliminate the company’s marketing and medical affairs teams, according to publicly available documents. The restructuring, which is estimated to cost between $2.3 and $2.8 million including severance costs, is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThis is the company’s third round of significant layoffs in less than a year and a half.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September 2023, Akili announced it would lay off 40% of its staff, primarily in its field sales force and market access teams.\n\nIn January 2023, the company made plans to lay off 46 employees, equivalent to 30% of its workforce.\n\nThe two 2023 layoffs were driven by the economic environment and the company’s strategic shift towards a user subscription-based model, moving away from its previous prescription-focused approach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAkili did not respond to Behavioral Health Business’s request for comment by the time of publication.\n\nThe news of the most recent workforce cut coincided with the announcement of another strategic shift.\n\nAkili revealed that its board would evaluate several strategic options and alternatives in an attempt to maximize shareholder value.\n\n“There can be no assurance that this process will result in Akili pursuing a transaction or that any transaction, if pursued, will be completed on attractive terms, if at all,” the filing read.\n\nThe company also announced an amendment to its deal with Japan-based global pharmaceutical company Shionogi & Co, which includes Shionogi’s forgiveness of a $5 million long-term debt obligation, an upfront payment of $10.5 million and the potential for an additional $4.5 million.\n\nBoston, Massachusetts-based Akili’s digital therapeutic product EndeavorRx, which treats pediatric ADHD, received FDA clearance in 2020. The product operated through a video game experience and was designed to improve attention function in children ages 8 to 12.\n\nThe company offers a version of the therapeutic designed for adults, called EndeavorOTC, which also employs a gamified approach and is currently under FDA review.\n\nAkili will make its products available for purchase and will continue to support current users of its products.\n\nAkili is not the first digital therapeutics company to suffer financially. Pear Therapeutics, the first company to receive an FDA de novo clearance for a digital therapeutic, filed for bankruptcy in April 2023.\n\nPear’s demise likely cooled investor interest in digital therapeutics, according to the latest Pitchbook digital health report. Still, there was “a decent share of transactions” in the digital therapeutics space in 2023, the report’s authors wrote.\n\nNotably, digital therapeutics company BehaVR merged with Fern Health, a virtual chronic pain management company.\n\nPitchbook analysts anticipate an uptick in consolidations in digital therapeutics companies in 2024. In line with this prediction, digital health care company Dario, which offers behavioral health care, acquired technology company Twill in February.\n\nOther players in the digital therapeutics space are still hoping to find success, despite Pear’s failure and Akili’s struggles.",

    "# Comprehensive Report on Akili Interactive\n\n## Company Overview\nAkili Interactive, founded in 2011 and based in Boston, Massachusetts, is a pioneering digital therapeutics company that focuses on developing cognitive treatments through engaging video game technologies. The company is best known for its product, EndeavorRx, which is the first prescription video game treatment authorized by the FDA for pediatric ADHD. Akili went public in 2022 through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, initially valuing the company at around $1 billion, but its market cap has since significantly declined, trading below $1 as of early 2024 [(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)](https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/virtual-therapeutics-acquire-akili-video-games-adhd/).\n\n## Recent Developments\n### Acquisition by Virtual Therapeutics\nOn May 29, 2024, Akili announced a definitive agreement to be acquired by Virtual Therapeutics for approximately $34 million, translating to $0.4340 per share in cash. This acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024, pending certain conditions, including a majority of Akili shares being tendered [(Goodwin Law, 2024)](https://www.goodwinlaw.com/en/news-and-events/news/2024/05/announcements-lifesciences-ma-akili-interactive-to-be-acquired). Following the merger, Akili will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Virtual Therapeutics, which focuses on mental health solutions through immersive gaming [(Business Wire, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-enter-120000485.html).\n\n### Workforce Reductions\nIn April 2024, Akili announced it would lay off 46% of its workforce due to sluggish sales of its video game treatment for ADHD. This marked the third significant round of layoffs in less than a year, reflecting ongoing challenges in building a sustainable business model in the digital therapeutics space [(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)](https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/30/akili-interactive-digital-therapeutics-firm-announce-layoffs-restructuring/). The company has shifted its strategy to focus on over-the-counter sales of its products, including EndeavorOTC, which targets adults with ADHD [(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)](https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/virtual-therapeutics-acquire-akili-video-games-adhd/).\n\n## Financial Performance\nIn 2023, Akili reported revenues of $1.7 million, with $1.2 million coming from EndeavorOTC and $523,000 from EndeavorRx. However, the company also faced a net loss of $59.5 million for the year [(Reuter & Taylor, MedTech Dive, 2024)](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/). The financial struggles have been compounded by a significant drop in stock price, leading to a delisting notice from Nasdaq in October 2023 [(Reuter & Taylor, MedTech Dive, 2024)](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/).\n\n## Product Information\n### EndeavorRx\nEndeavorRx is a video game designed to improve attention function in children with ADHD. It received FDA clearance in 2020 and is delivered through a captivating gaming experience. The product is not intended to replace traditional medication but is designed to be used in conjunction with other treatments [(Walia, Boston Globe, 2024)](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/05/29/business/akili-interactive-merge-with-washington-based-virtual-therapeutics/). Akili has also developed EndeavorOTC, an over-the-counter version aimed at adults, which has shown better sales performance compared to its prescription counterpart [(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)](https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/virtual-therapeutics-acquire-akili-video-games-adhd/).\n\n### Clinical Validation\nAkili's products are backed by clinical trials, including a recent Phase III trial conducted in Japan, which demonstrated significant improvements in ADHD symptoms among pediatric patients using a localized version of EndeavorRx [(Tracy, PharmaExec, 2024)](https://www.pharmexec.com/view/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-strike-definitive-merger-agreement-seeking-to-improve-mental-health-through-immersive-video-games). The company has emphasized the importance of clinical validation in establishing its products as effective therapeutic options.\n\n## Leadership and Strategic Direction\nMatt Franklin serves as the CEO of Akili and has expressed optimism about the merger with Virtual Therapeutics, highlighting the potential to leverage combined expertise in gaming and digital therapeutics to address mental health needs more effectively [(Business Wire, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-enter-120000485.html). Dan Elenbaas, CEO of Virtual Therapeutics, has also noted the importance of Akili's clinical rigor in developing new products [(Tracy, PharmaExec, 2024)](https://www.pharmexec.com/view/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-strike-definitive-merger-agreement-seeking-to-improve-mental-health-through-immersive-video-games).\n\n## Conclusion\nAkili Interactive is navigating a challenging landscape in the digital therapeutics market, marked by significant workforce reductions and a strategic shift towards over-the-counter products. The upcoming acquisition by Virtual Therapeutics presents an opportunity for Akili to continue its mission under a new umbrella, potentially enhancing its ability to deliver innovative mental health solutions. However, the company's financial struggles and the broader challenges facing the digital therapeutics sector raise questions about its long-term viability and growth prospects. \n\nFor prospective candidates and investors, the merger could signal a new chapter for Akili, but careful consideration of the risks and market dynamics is essential."
