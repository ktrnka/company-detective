      "# [Sid Meier's Civilization](https://civilization.2k.com/civ/)\nRelease date: September 1991\n\nDesigned by Sid Meier and Bruce Shelley, the original Civilization is widely considered one of the most influential turn-based strategy games ever made. Civilization launched with many innovative features that persist in the series to this day.\n\nAssuming the role of one of history's greatest leaders, chosen from a roster of 15, players guided their chosen civilizations from the dawn of recorded history circa 4000 BC all the way to the year 2100, by which time the game predicted that space voyages to Alpha Centauri will be a reality.\n\nBeing the first civilization to assemble a spaceship and complete that journey was one of three ways to achieve victory in the original Civilization. Other options included conquering every city belonging to other civilizations, and scoring the most points before the game ends after a predetermined number of turns or upon reaching the year 2100. Multiple paths to victory remain a defining part of what it means to be a Civilization game to this day.\n\nRegardless of which victory type players pursued, every crucial economic, political, and military decision was theirs alone to make. Scientific advancements, wonders of the world, military strength, and population growth were just a few of the factors they had to consider while building an empire to stand the test of time.",

      "# [Want To Know More About The Quarry Horror Game?](https://quarrygame.2k.com/faq/)\nA: The Quarry is an all-new teen-horror narrative game, where every decision shapes your unique story from a tangled web of possibilities. Any character can be the star of the show - or die - before daylight comes. Take control of nine camp counselors and, using your wits in conversation and reflexes during action, do everything you can to steer them away from—or directly into—danger.\n\nA: Yes! The Quarry offers multiple ways for you to experience the fright with friends. You can play the game solo, or with up to seven other companions in local couch co-op with each player controlling a counselor's actions. In addition, The Quarry features an exciting online mode where you and your friends can watch along and vote on key decisions, creating a story shaped by the whole group!\n\nConsole players: Note that online multiplayer is only supported across the same PlayStation/Xbox generations (PS4 to PS4, PS5 to PS5, Xbox One to Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S to Xbox Series X|S). If you buy the Deluxe Edition you'll have access to both previous- and new-generation versions of the game (within the same console family) and can choose which one to launch in order to play with friends.\n\nA: Death Rewind is a retry mechanic that normally unlocks after your first completion of The Quarry. Start the story with three opportunities to reverse a playable character's death, giving you a chance to alter fate and save them in the process. But with only three retries per playthrough, you'll have to decide when someone's life is truly worth saving, and the undoing of one horrible end may lead to another. Choose wisely.\n\nA: Yes. If you own a digital version of The Quarry for PlayStation 4 or Xbox One you can purchase the Digital Upgrade to provide access to the new-gen version within the same console family and entitled to the same Xbox network or PlayStation Network account.\n\nIf you own a physical version of The Quarry for PlayStation 4 you have the option to purchase the PS5 Digital Upgrade if you own a PlayStation 5 with a disc drive. The PlayStation 4 The Quarry disc must be inserted into the PlayStation 5 whenever playing the new-gen digital version of the game.\n\nA: Our goal with Streamer Mode was to provide a simple and streamlined way for players to create content for The Quarry that included music. Due to evolving standards and practices with how licensed music is implemented and tracked across games and content, this wasn’t the case at launch and we decided to switch the name to \"Alternate Music\" to better set expectations for our streaming community. We also recommend adding “The Quarry” in their video/streaming headline to help avoid any issues.",

Then, with guidance from the Art Director, integrated the characters into the engine and polished them to finish. In true horror genre style, we killed the characters in an array of different ways, creating all manner of 3D gore: fire, ice and dismemberment!",

It still never took off in the same way. The benefit is that you can get files for the latest squads/teams for older games like PES2018 or some shit.\n\nOne of the reasons PES never took off was because of its “ease of accessibility” despite having Option Files the fact you had to do it at all erased 90% of the market for it.\n\nEven if they make teams/leagues/kits shareable in game, I 100% don’t doubt that they will remove any “100% accurate league” or other community changes.

Certain moves make you slide to the left or right (or if your on the ground roll away)... please make every reversal have an actual counter to it (Sliding doesn’t count) Too many people can spam one move and then use one of the other “quick” moves to force you to reverse twice in a row. It’s extremely cheap and frustrating. Reversal Burner moves have run rampant throughout this game for YEARS. \n2. A spamming detection system needs to be in place. Unfortunately not all moves are created equal and the  harder to reverse moves can be spammed over and over again. Reward players to play more creatively and I think you’ll see people return to this game.\nAlso as a side note: I know people in leagues that love how cool some moves look but are afraid to use them because they do not want to get majored reversed in a game. Any game that makes you “afraid” to use a wrestling move needs to remove all major reversals. Also, in tornado tags - most leagues have a “respect the move” rule. It would be nice to have that as a option - for example if my partner is getting a move place on him I would be unable to break up the move. I would have to wait until the animation is complete before I could strike. Sometime just bumping into your own partner causes a move to get broken up. Please give me this option on future games.\n\n### Comment ID fs7tktf with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7tktf/) (in reply to ID fs7moub):\n[removed]\n\n#### Comment ID fs7vwag with +4 score by [(Neg_Crepe, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7vwag/) (in reply to ID fs7tktf):\n>optional GM features to universe mode?\n\nit needs to be a separated mode.

In particular, it sucks that putting someone through a table garners the same reaction as doing a simple suplex right now :/\n\nIs there any chance we return to what Universe Mode was back in WWE SVR 2011 and WWE 12?  People loved the randomness and unpredictability of the modes back then. Being completely honest, I hate the rivalry system. We face our opponents so many times before the ppv, even in WrestleMania rivalries.

There are so many aspects of the game that probably require a lot more effort that it appears on the surface.  Delivering a giant roster, for example. Or being able to create your own superstar and add any of 9000 costume parts to customize him or her. To give you a sense of the complexity there, we use a system called \"fit tech\" to make all the CAS parts fit onto superstars of different sizes. Fit tech has a line of code for every word in the entire Harry Potter book series, plus 100,000 more!

Early on, I spent a ton of time with the creative director, and we went through a bunch of shows, PPV’s and such. I responded to a lot of it, and really wanted to synthesize into a unifying theme. Then, one day, I walked past his desk and he was watching some behind the scenes material that really focused on Bautista. I stopped in my tracks, and we spend the next hour or so scrubbing through material. I think the vision really emerged from those conversations—what’s it like to actually BE on the roster, to be a part of this spectacular entertainment?

However recently I have become interested in wrestling again and was going to buy the most recent game at the time (2K19), however I thought the servers would go offline so I waited for 2K20, we know how that turned out. After that I thought the 2K franchise was just plain bad, and I wouldn't have a game that was like the ones I'd play when I was younger (SvR 2008-WWE13).\n\nBut, with the announcement of you taking over as executive producer, and then your continued engagement with fans I have hope again. So I guess I don't have any questions, just want to let you that I can't wait to see what the next game is going to be like. Also, I realise there is a ton of requests by fans on what should be in the next game which is great, just make sure it isn't bloated with content. Only add top stuff (in my opinion anyway, i'm not a game dev).\n\nThanks for sparing us your time!\n\n### Comment ID fs82lpc with +60 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs82lpc/) (in reply to ID fs7uxvx):\nThanks for that awesome comment!

It seems like such an odd thing to not add when in real life the Superstars always change hairstyles and shave or let them grow, or changing makeup, especially when trying to create attires changing since those options would be a big help to change their look or even update their look if it ends up being outdated after the game’s release. \n\nIt’s never been in any of the previous games so I was wondering if their was a reason for not adding this, since it’s kind of one of the most requested things for superstars creation suite I’ve seen through the years of the games releasing.\n\n### Comment ID fs7uhl9 with +120 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7uhl9/) (in reply to ID fs7nngd):\nAs you might imagine, likeness rights are highly sensitive where real people are involved.

For example, say both you and your opponent are heavily damaged in your match, and you hit your finisher. Instead of being able to immediately go for the pin, your wrestler has to recover and crawl his or her way over to the opponent, leading to more drama and more realism. Or possibly random injuries during matches in Universe and the highly requested GM mode, forcing you, the showrunner, to make a change of plans to a rivalry or title contendership?\n\n2) Any chance we could get more than 2 attire slots for custom wrestlers?\n\n3) The PS3/360 games had little to no trouble adding a custom music option, but it hasn't appeared since the jump to PS4/Xbone. Is this a WWE mandated decision or just something unable to be done on the console. I'm sure you're aware how disappointing it always is for a large number of users in the community who love using indy/classic wrestlers and they aren't able to import those wrestler's themes into the game. \n\nThanks for taking the time to answer the community!\n\n### Comment ID fs82fyn with +139 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs82fyn/) (in reply to ID fs7y0qt):\nCore gameplay is one of the major investments we’re making in the next installment—one of six pillars we are focused on disproportionately in development. We are looking at much-loved previous games like No Mercy or Smackdown: Here Comes the Pain, along with top franchise installments, and more modern wrestling and fighting games to build an all-new philosophical foundation for the game. People who hope that we holistically adopt the control scheme or philosophy from one of their favorite games are likely to be disappointed; we are trying to combine the best ideas out there into a brand new wrestling experience that sets a new standard.\n\nThe game play team is focused on Accessibility, Depth and Wrestling Experience. For Accessibility, we’re obsessed with a simple, intuitive interface which has meaning and depth in a wide variety of contexts—i.e. the game is a lot smarter about what the player is trying to do given a gameplay situation (in a grapple, on the ropes, against a turnbuckle, etc.), with consistent inputs regardless of situation. New players should be able to accidentally pull off awesome moves just by playing with and experimenting with controls.  \n\nFor Depth, we’re looking a lot at ring position, deeper combos and “working” moves, limb damage, technical capabilities, match momentum and unlocks, and rock-paper-scissors (RPS) strategies by archetype and player style. Depth doesn’t come from the manual skill of pressing the proper buttons but from the psychological game of anticipating and countering your opponent’s strategy, and this needs to be built in from the very foundation, so expect a significant evolution in gameplay with the next installment.\n\nThe last aspect of great gameplay is capturing the essence of professional wrestling, which has dimensions of drama, changing context, massive roster, backstage action, weapons and props, audience participation and spectacle. One of the huge challenges of the franchise is finding ways for players to feel in control of the vast number of potential outcomes in a given match. While we take lessons from fighting games, action RPG’s and other genres, this aspect helps us stay focused on delivering a through-and-through wrestling game. While we’re determined to deliver the spectacle and specific moments of a genuine match, I can say we’re trying to get away form UI popups or mini games to represent things like pins or reversals, and instead move those concepts into more fully-realized mechanics which feel like extensions of the main experience.\n\n#### Comment ID fs8mddi with +22 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs8mddi/) (in reply to ID fs82fyn):\nThis is the best thing I've read so far about what you guys are working towards.

At the five-month mark, the team had delivered six major patches (seven if you count the Day 1 patch), and four installments of downloadable content. We reached a point where the biggest issues we were seeing had to do with memory overruns with custom characters and arenas. Fixing these issues would require us to change file formats, branching our code in such a way that improvements to 2K20 wouldn’t carry forward into the next game (and could potentially invalidate existing community creations). We were also facing the reality that maintaining older code was preventing us from making bigger, more comprehensive changes that were required to set a new direction. Finally, given we had made the decision to skip a year before the next release, we had used almost half of the additional time we had to make the next project great.  \n\nWeighing all of this, and in discussion with the team leadership, I felt the best thing would be to turn our focus to the next project. I know this isn’t the news a lot of you wanted to hear, so just trying to be transparent and direct about some difficult decisions we had to make to try to set us up to deliver the best possible results in the future.\n\n#### Comment ID fs7vehg with +95 score by [(CarlaSevilla86, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7vehg/) (in reply to ID fs7uydl):\nLook, I really appreciate you coming to Reddit to give all fans an explanation, regardless of whether we like the result or not.

We have to fold community feedback in with development priorities, and more general research and feedback we use internally. Ultimately, the evidence will be in the game, but I can assure you we’re looking at player feedback more closely than ever.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID fs7tzy4 with +25 score by [(GlorioleJumper, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7tzy4/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nI was massively disappointed to see no cross generation support on the top requested feedback items for community creations. I love creating CAWs, but it’s so draining recreating the same guys year on year from scratch when the background infrastructure is the same. There’s no recreation support and it hurts at times, I.e. no scales or numbers to help recreate faces and bodies, it becomes so hard to match a face year on year. Items of clothing aren’t numbered or named and often move on the list. Movesets despite being the same in the background takes ages to replicate with no support.\n\nIs there any plan to introduce ways to help content creators import something/anything to the next game in the series to help support this? \n\nI love the creation suite, it’s just a huge shame and a drain to restart from scratch each and every year.\n\n### Comment ID fs82rem with +53 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs82rem/) (in reply to ID fs7tzy4):\nFrom the online producer:  As an online producer, the concept of cross platform community creations is exciting to us as well!

I think it's so significant to the entertainment form in general, and to the history of WWE. Isn’t that everyone’s?\n\nI don’t have as much to draw on for a favorite match as most fans, but I loved Edge vs. Orton at this past Wrestlemania. I thought they did the impossible, delivering that kind of intensity without an audience. \n\nFor storylines, I admit to a (maybe) bizarre fascination with The Undertaker, and the storylines and rivalries associated with him. \n\nLess of a storyline but a persona, I’ll say I think Finn Balor and the demon persona (with ties to Finn MacCool, and Balor, king of demons—Irish mythology I grew up with), are just phenomenal. I was also hugely impressed by Balor’s statement of inclusion at Wrestlemania 34. In spite of how exotic the demon persona is, I think Balor reaches levels of authenticity few other superstars can touch. Respect.\n\n#### Comment ID fs88pmr with +8 score by [(questssb, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs88pmr/) (in reply to ID fs86zws):\nI appreciate this answer!

What is the team doing to make this the Undisputed Wrestling Game Champion hands down compared to all the other new wrestling games coming out.  2K games have been around for over 20 years so you guys can't be out done by startups.\n2. I know people want features, match types, ect. but is the team looking at the bread and butter of a true wrestling game? Improving gameplay, AI, collision, hit detection, targeting.   I look at past games like SVR 2006 being pretty good at AI and even 2019 was decent  but 2020 seems like a big step backwards and AI is just a punching bag.  I hope all of this is prioritize high because no matter the features, match types, modes, it's all for nothing if gameplay and AI is bad. \n\ntx\n\n### Comment ID fs840sr with +30 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs840sr/) (in reply to ID fs7tdjf):\nWe're focused on making a great game, not thinking too much about the other new wrestling games coming out.

(Gauntlet,Casket,War Games,street fight,Special Guest Referee , Winner Takes All ,Buried Alive,Ambulance,K.O.T.R, Fight pit,strap,etc.)\n\n2.How likely could you guys implement a feature where we could use our own custom music for our superstars entrances? (Basically using Spotify)\n\n3.Is it possible to be able to create our own stories and be able to upload them to community creations for others to download and be able to use?\n\n4.Since other games have been implementing crossplay, could we see that implemented into community creations and online mode?\n\n5.Can you please have NO limit on how many superstars/other things you can download in a day and also,NO limit on the amount of superstars/other things you can download from community creations completely not just in a day Just get rid of them entirely please? The reason I say this because for many years community creations would have a limit to how many you things you can  download and it ruins the whole point on being able to download creator’s superstars and other creations when there is a limit\n\n6.Is the expectation that you guys are looking to massively change how the next Wwe2k game will be on the next generation consoles since your game will most likely release a year after they release or are  you guys expecting it to just be a port to next gen with basically nothing new but maybe slight improvements?\n\n### Comment ID fs7xrnn with +68 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7xrnn/) (in reply to ID fs7mxs2):\nMatch types are derived from AI logic, physics, arena layout and other elements which then get crafted into rulesets for specific matches.  We are putting a ton of emphasis on core gameplay at the moment, and will need to rebuild match types based upon our new systems.

However, I feel like an important question that should be asked is, have you guys played any of the older non 2K WWE titles such as the SVR titles, No Mercy, Here Comes the Pain, Day of Reckoning, etc. as well as the older 2K titles from 14-19? If so which one was your favorite, what was your favorite mode and why did you enjoy it so much?\n\n\nMy second question is that I saw in the thread you started about the face morphing and create a superstar that your sir has been playing the games and have been creating in the various modes. What new features/improvements have you yourself wanted to add to the game and what is something that the community is asking for that you feel should be added. One of my favorite modes is create a title and I have had an idea for you guys to do a sort of 3D emboss tool that would allow flat images to become 3D, with the edge color of the image being the color for the shapes sides in the 3d space. This would allow for us to take flat pictures and make new belt plates to match new ones that appear on TV that may have a unique shape not seen in any of the templates of create a title.\n\nFinally #3, will 2k20 get ANYMORE UPDATES. I mainly play 19 but I know there are many who still play 20 and would love to hear any kind of news regarding this.\n\nThanks again!\n\n### Comment ID fs7zjhe with +60 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7zjhe/) (in reply to ID fs7mz87):\nFrom a Design Lead:\nMany of us on the team have been playing wrestling games dating back to the days of the NES. We actually have a N64 and GameCube in the office and will occasionally play No Mercy, Day of Reckoning 2 & Ultimate Muscle (AKI's last wrestling game).\nAKI's output on the N64 are some of my personal favorites as they were mechanically sound games that were more accessible than many other wrestling options that have come before & even after. The AKI games also did a fantastic job capturing the spirit of wrestling and had an incredible roster.\nIn terms of modes, very few games have achieved the open-ended nature and freedom of Here Comes The Pain. That's a personal favorite. SvR 2009 and 2010 Road to Wrestlemania's were great as well as they really embraced the theater of wrestling.\n\n#### Comment ID fs81rx0 with +27 score by [(kiwiguy187, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs81rx0/) (in reply to ID fs7zjhe):\nThe match physics in smackdown vs raw 2011 were the best in the series. The freedom of movement when executing moves was unparalleled and only featured in that game. Lift a guy up with any move and you had total 360° choice where they landed.\nIt also applied to the weapons too. You could place a weapon down or lean it anywhere you wanted.\nSeriously look at or even play TLC matches in 2011.

I posted earlier about some of the comprehensive changes we're making to gameplay. It's still early days, but our initial results are super encouraging. To your second question, we're taking a hard look at how reversals work, to create a reversal system that's more deeply integrated with the overall flow of combat.  We're also looking at match length, and systems which allow for shorter, more dominating matches. Regarding four, we're looking at all aspects of core combat, so expect improvements there as well.\n\n## Comment ID fs7ohot with +17 score by [(the905guy11, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7ohot/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nWill you do open and honest during development of the next 2K game?

You seem to legitimately care about what we want in this community. I have a few questions, if you’re able to answer them that’s great. Thank you!\n\n1. Was there a reason it took 12+ years (5 during 2K’s takeover) to at least acknowledge that a wide portion of the fan base have wanted and begged for a GM mode? It felt like it was purposely ignored until you stepped in.\n\n2. What’s stopping 2K from releasing monthly/quarterly updates that include things like new wrestlers, updated characters models and even things like championships and move sets and putting them out as DLC? I can understand that the wrestling games are supposed to take place during a time period, so if you keep them updated the end of 2K19’s roster would just be 2K20’s starting roster, but what about when it comes to certain situations like someone getting a new haircut or entirely new gimmick right when the game comes out?\n\n3. In future MyCareer modes, can it be possible that we use wrestlers who are already in the game instead of a custom character? Some people just don’t enjoy using someone that isn’t real. That’s why some people prefer a Season Mode or Road to WrestleMania.\n\nPS. I’m sure a lot of us miss the roster reveals SummerSlam weekend that show actual character models and small clips from the persons entrance when announcing they made they cut. Instead of what’s been going on lately where it’s just a bunch of text dropped on a website. Just a little thing if you’ve never heard of them doing it back when THQ was around, it was a really cool.\n\nThank you for doing this again, we all appreciate you here!\n\n## Comment ID fs7vhev with +24 score by [(TonyPizzaGuyYT, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7vhev/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nI know you are new to the franchise, but why hasn’t online been a focus of the WWE 2K franchise?

I feel like the big disconnect between the consumer and devs is that we as fans get so excited for what will be in the game coming up, but we literally do not hear a single word about the game until June, and wait till a month before release to even get a full roster. We hear almost nothing about new features (which have been lacking since the switch to new gen but that’s for a different time) and we literally get 0 communication which i feel causes a huge problem because what we expect or want, never even happens, but i feel like it could be fixed with proper communication between devs, and fan base. \n\nAs i’m sure you’re aware the weekly product is constantly changing, it would also be nice if we got updated attires, entrances, moves etc instead of waiting a whole year to try out some things. this could also be addressed by allowing us to use Spotify or uploaded MP3’s in the game for entrance music, and allowing us to use the edit superstar feature to edit a superstars likeness completely. \n\nAlso I urge you guys to please try and capture the feel of a WWE show in the games. I would never know i’m at WrestleMania doing Hogan vs Austin because of how dead the game feels. Even the most simple wrestling things like strike sequences, and proper chain wrestling aren’t in the game. I really hope these things can be fixed especially if this game is going to be called a simulator. \n\nThanks for doing the AMA btw man, so far you’ve been so awesome about interacting with us and showing a true interest in our franchise!\n\n### Comment ID fs88nwq with +24 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs88nwq/) (in reply to ID fs7o9my):\nI hear you on the updates to development. As a fan of other franchises, I know I love to have a constant flow of information that lets me know what's happening in development. We have a commitment to improve on that front for the coming game, so expect to get a lot more insight along the way. At the same time, if I'm honest, there are times when we really have to be heads down creating the game, and have less time than we'd like to have a dialog with the community. I'll also say that we want to hold some things back, and this is primarily to make the experience of some key reveals as thrilling as we can. Ultimately, we want to create an experience for players that extends outside the boundaries of the game.\n\n## Comment ID fs7woid with +13 score by [(davereveiws255, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7woid/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nJust 2 questions sir!\n1.

Or is it just gonna be gm mode,  if there is a gm mode. Also I highly recommend you guys think of doing a Nintendo switch version.

I love professional wrestling in general in the unique way it spans the globe, and merges sports and athletic competition with big personalities, storytelling, and drama, all of which translates really well to games.  At its core, it's takes elements of the best genres of video games, combat, story telling, drama, and spectacle. A good WWE game offers the experience of BEING the Superstar, not observing the Superstar. Every decision and movement can feel important and visceral. The approach to the next WWE 2K franchise game will view WWE as a real competition, with high stakes, pain, rivalries and drama and we want the player to feel invested in all of it.\n\n## Comment ID fs7nf71 with +24 score by [(LemonFoxyTasty, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7nf71/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\n1.

When the audio team talks about what they’re trying to achieve with Commentary, you get a ton of domain-specific lingo, like beer tasting or something (except that instead of “catty” or “resinous” or “malt backbone,” you hear terms like “move call” or “grunt harvest” or “one-shot”). To give you an idea of the scope and complexity, Move Calls, for example, have over 44,000 unique calls. A simple move call like, *“Big hit there by The Rock!”* might be three seconds. If that’s the average across all calls, that would represent about 36 hours of audio, maybe 10-12 days in a recording studio with months of dialog editing and implementation after that. While these are huge systems, we have plans underway to improve and modify, and especially to do a better job of synchronizing crowd animated and audio responses.\n\n## Comment ID fs7nuq2 with +14 score by [(Krushhz, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7nuq2/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nOutside of producing the exciting modes and match types that we all want in the game.

Certain moves make you slide to the left or right (or if your on the ground roll away)... please make every reversal have an actual counter to it (Sliding doesn’t count) Too many people can spam one move and then use one of the other “quick” moves to force you to reverse twice in a row. It’s extremely cheap and frustrating. Reversal Burner moves have run rampant throughout this game for YEARS. \n2. A spamming detection system needs to be in place. Unfortunately not all moves are created equal and the  harder to reverse moves can be spammed over and over again.

It’s one of the biggest questions I asked when I first started. Basically, “Is it theater, or is it sport?” In all our discussions, we came down on the side of sport. We want to focus on the authenticity of rivalries, athleticism, and the experience of being a superstar, locked into meaningful combat in front of an audience of thousands.  \n\nWhen we describe the core focus of the next game, we sometimes use the phrase, “Step out of the crowd, step into the ring.” This reflects an effort to move a little bit away from the audience/broadcast experience, and toward the superstar experience. This central focus can affect our approach to almost every aspect of the game.

We’re going to be measuring and testing constantly, and at some point may reach out to the community to conduct a real-world closed beta, to make sure we’re getting traction on the issues that matter most for online play.\n\n## Comment ID fs7q9hl with +7 score by [(JustATributeCC, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7q9hl/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nCreate An Arena is far and away my most used feature in these games.

Over the years, we've seen almost all of the past hairstyles from the in-game female superstars added to the creation suite (2K15 into 2K16, 2K16 into 2K17) but over the years the number has gotten smaller and smaller and we come to see a lack of new exciting additions to the creation suite. Creating women, in my opinion as well as the communities, is a far more tedious process than other creative aspects due to the fine details from hair, to make up to their intricate ring gear. Will we see any new developments and new ways to utilize and maximize the creation suite for women in the future?\n\n### Comment ID fs81uir with +28 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs81uir/) (in reply to ID fs7xw0x):\nThe character creation suite is getting a ton of focus for the next iteration.

I guess no one does an AMA without a couple kicks to the shins. \n\nI joined the team several months after WWE2K20 shipped, so I might not have a satisfying answer to that question. Having said that, I’m deeply sympathetic and impressed with the level of effort and dedication that went into the game. Game development is not an exact science. There are tons of projections, estimations and tradeoffs that don’t always come together the way you hoped. Often—very often, actually—the primary tension is between the ambition you have for a project, and your ability to achieve the full scope of that ambition. I think 2K20 had a very ambitious team that was passionate about delivering something awesome—and big—to the community.  \n\nI can tell you that I believe this team has an amazing game in them. At every level, and in every discipline, I’ve met and gotten to work with people I consider to be true experts in their craft.

Like every superstars current theme and the one before it for people who like to do older gimmicks.)\n\n-Option to select a hairstyle previously used on a character, I know that adding major changes to a character is hard to get the license to do but this could be a way to also fix that (example Seth Rollins hair options could be his current hair, his Shield hairstyle with the blonde, etc.)\n\n-Customize make up color for in game superstars (a color slider would be useful here. I use Maryse a lot and kinda hate that dark lipstick...give us the option to make it different colors)\n\n-Create a manager entrance (I would like to have a custom entrance for my manager and I but you can't select the managers to put on a team and make one.

I’m just wondering if the team is carrying on using the same engine that has been in use for a few years now with incremental upgrades each year or if you’ll be building a new engine?\n\n2. Have you ever thought about bringing in something like NaturalMotion’s Euphoria engine to make the physics that bit more realistic?\n\n3. How possible is it to include occasional updates to superstars in the next game to keep them up to date? Not being a developer or really knowing much that goes into it all apart from the basics that most know I wonder how much of a hassle say sending someone out to a WWE show and say scanning someone’s new tattoo or freshly shaved head and then adding them in say a monthly update to keep the models somewhat up to date. I think we all remember Baron Corbin shaving his head like a few weeks of 2k19 coming out and having that “well sh*t” reaction knowing we’d have to wait a year to see the little change come into effect\n\nThanks for taking the time to listen to the community, it really shows you’re properly getting stuck in and taking feedback to heart 👍🏻\n\n## Comment ID fs838tq with +2 score by [(ACaulkGoblin, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs838tq/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nNot sure if this is over with or not, but Hey Patrick my name is Nate, I’m one of the mods here and a huge fan of pro wrestling and wrestling video games. I grew up constantly drawing wrestling stages on schoolwork, paper, etc. so when the WWE games allowed for us to start to actually build our own arenas, to say I was ecstatic is an understatement. I was disappointed 19 didn’t offer any new stage parts, as the same with 20. To me it almost feels that Create An Arena is the ugly step child of the creation suite. Going forward will Create An Arena have less restrictions, and more to it? Personally I’d love an option for choosing two walls, titantrons, minitrons, and headers, along with less restrictions on placement of said items.

I’m tired of reading. \n2) In CAW, make it where we can actually name our wrestlers whatever we want and have them announced using that name. I’ve created the same wrestler ever since Warzone which was the first one where you could create your own wrestler. His name is Johnny Slade. I’m tired of having to use John E. Slate. I’ve created him on Madden on SNES and they were able to do it even back then. So I know it’s possible. \n3) Custom Music.  I read your response where you talked about licensing. That’s BS. Here’s the deal...the music is FREE on Spotify. Spotify has not had any legal issues regarding the matter. So, what if you could make custom music an option for private use which it already is but censor it when you go into online modes? \n4) Speaking of custom entrance, allow custom timing of entrances to fit music.\n\n## Comment ID fsllps5 with +2 score by [(k_mk_316, Reddit, 2020-06-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fsllps5/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nHi Patrick,\n\n\nOne of the major flaws for over a decade is the lack of creativity and freedom. \n\nI’ve been a fan since WWF WARZONE, Original smackdown games , no mercy.

In the past, THQ (The previous WWE Games dev) would \"leak\" information about the game almost as soon as the game was announced, where 2K would wait until closer to release to give out any information.

If an opponent jumps off the top rope and you dropkick them mid air, make them fly up against the ropes and maybe tumble to the outside - not just fall to their back in a preset animation. I want the wrestlers and the ring to not feel so...programmed. That way, every match you play feels different and keeps you wanting to try new things to see more surprises.\n\nSame for weapons - more natural, spontaneous and organic options with tables, ladders, chairs, etc. With social media being as big as it is, people want to make highlight reels of dope spots on YouTube and Instagram but when they're all pre-programmed into the game and not random and exciting, they don't feel special.\n\nAny plans to fix this?\n\n### Comment ID fsenhzd with +2 score by [(Guitar1995, Reddit, 2020-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fsenhzd/) (in reply to ID fs7os4p):\nI couldn't agree more.

A good example of this type of content is the biggest WWE Games channel out there, ElementGames. Without highlight reel, Element wouldn't be able to create the truly unique and captivating content that has made him stand out from everyone else.\n\nThis is a mode that will make innovations one year and then have those innovations taken away the next. Example: 2K18 > 2K19, the amount of time you could record in HR was increased and the \"slow mode\" preview we were getting was fixed. 2K19 > 2K20, those innovations were just completely taken away and we ended up with a worse version than the 2K18 one. \n\nGames like Fortnite are expanding their player base because they have such an in-depth HR/theater mode. It naturally draws the creative types to the game when there are tools to use to make unique content.\n\nWhat does the future hold for Highlight Reel in the WWE 2K series?\n\n\\- BrokenFunBash\n\n## Comment ID fs7qiit with +2 score by [(daddymeltzer, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7qiit/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nI have a few questions\n\n1.

Are you going to do everything that you can in order to give that to us? Because let’s face it this community can eat you up and spit you out. We all just want an enjoyable game with features that we’ve been craving for for years and we haven’t gotten them.\n\nGM Mode, an In Depth Career Mode (we’ve gotten that bitch it’s just not what we thought it should be), missing match types, a Universe Mode that’s Playable and so much more.\n\nAll I want to ask is that if there is going to be a version for the next consoles that’ll be out for almost a year when this next game (assuming it’ll be WWE 2K22) comes out.\n\nThere’s no excuse as to why it wouldn’t be because of the consoles are out for almost a year you’d hourly be looking at that engine.\n\nAlso another question I have is that can you please make the commentary better? I keep hear Michael Cole, Byron Saxton, and Cory Graves say the same lines over and over again and it’s not even realistic! I hit a DDT and Cole called it a suplex. That’s not even the same move.\n\nAnd another question is can you please make the crowd more electric? The Crowd in WWE 2K19 & 20 from what I’ve heard is after like 10-15 minutes in a match (if it lasts that long) the crowd goes completely silent till you hit a signature or finisher. And then they pop for it but then goes dead silent after that move is done. The crowds at a WWE Event aren’t silent as I have been apart of many WWE Crowds when they have come to CT. So please fix this issue.\n\nOh and one more question is can you please update WWE 2K19 with the WWE 2K20 Superstars? I know that’ll take a lot of work but let’s face it... no one plays WWE 2K20 any more. It’s unplayable. An updated WWE 2K19 with the roster, arenas, and more would not only make me happy but a ton of people in the WWE Games Community happy as well.\n\nI want to thank you for all you have done so far keeping us in the loop when it comes to this upcoming installment in the WWE2K Franchise. You’re already doing leaps and bounds better than any other person in 2K as they have been hiding stuff from us for years. You keep us informed and we will show love back. It’s that simple.

I truly feel and belive that the ring announcing in wwe games SHOULD ALWAYS be done with 100% maximum effort, & even extra special at ppv events like Royal Rumble, Wrestlemania, SummerSlam, Survivor Series etc. I promise you that if given the chance I would absolutely & unequivocally provide the best possible experience ever in that regard in wwe games, further more my objectives would be to make sure the players feel as if they're at an actual event. No two intros of the same person or anyone else would ever be exactly the same. Everything should be unique and have it's on special feeling. Just look at my you tube page GoldenTalkTv....my work speaks for itself. Thank you so much for your time and have a fantastic day and stay safe! \n\nP.S. Announcing in general for wwe video games should absolutely never feel so dull and uniform so to speak, this all goes back to putting in that same passion at a live event/ppv...should be put in the game at all times.\n\n## Comment ID fs7t0fg with +1 score by [(Leeyuna, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7t0fg/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nIf there is a my career this year, could there be a way to have a more open ending to it.

The originals idea was awful to be honest, I've had the series every year for 23 years and that was the worst addition I have seen. What people want is a better creation suite, gm mode (this is the biggest one) and the old match types like buried alive, inferno etc. back in the franchise, I'd say those are the big ones. Also why is there no guitar weapon anymore!?! Elias is in the game and that should be Incentive enough to have a guitar added. Last thing, the controls. Please put them back to the way they were before 😂 what you have to remember is while a small percentage of people will be picking up the game for the first time, it's all about keeping your current clientele happy, the majority of people that purchase the series have played it before.\n\n## Comment ID fs7veu9 with +1 score by [(Goodaa123, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7veu9/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nIs a new engine in the works?

It’s way too easy to reverse in the new games, even with the Ai reversal boosted and being on legendary.\n\nThe pinning system now is horrendous, just make the green kickout box THE SAME DAMN SPOT EVERY TIME and just have it get smaller and faster the more you advance but at the same time, don’t make it a centimeter because chances are you can dominate a match for 20 (if it doesn’t crash by then) and they’ll have kicked out of every signature and finisher and they’ll pin me twice and it’s all over because you have it set up so terrible.\n\nI probably have the most hours on WWE 2k20 on Xbox one than most people in the community, what you’re trying to do is good but where we are now is terrible!

That they pushed WWE Originals as this big groundbreaking feature, but it wasn't a part of the actual game. It was DLC. It was pre-planned paid content that you didn't get with the actual full price of game. So the game was basically no different than the previous years outside of a new story mode. I think it was a very cheap tatic to get people to spend more on the game. \n\nI'm an old school gamer so I feel that DLC should complement the main game, not be the biggest feature you want to play. That would be like bringing GM mode back but as DLC. Going forward what are your plans with additional content that is paid for dlc. Will it be for main features or for things like updated looks/etc?\n\n## Comment ID fs81nhq with +1 score by [(childishboyjay, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs81nhq/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nNow i doubt a lot if focus would be put in 2k19 but will there be more updates to 2k20\nBlood\nUniverse crashing\nVideo creator crashing\nMy online match crashed once\nThere are certain points in a match where someone kicks out and rises like the undertaker while the other  person is frustrated for the pin\nMore creation slots maybe??? \nAn 2006 john cena would be nice\nA 2006 kane\n\n## Comment ID fs81qqz with +1 score by [(Abdi-Omar, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs81qqz/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nHi Patrick can we keep the Concept of keeping Attires from previous games going into Next Gen Consoles since WWE 2K15 this has been one of the best things about the Creation Suite for many years for example all of AJ Styles Attires from his previous games dating back to his debut in 2K17 are all in WWE 2K20 this allows us to freshen up his Look when we so choose with a variety of options without having to rely on Community Creations this has been a great tool for current gen and it would be great to continue maintaining it\n\n## Comment ID fs81r1y with +1 score by [(ECKO_MARTiNEZ, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs81r1y/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nAre you guys using any older wrestling video games or wwe stars that play the game like Xavier woods on what they think could improve in today’s games?

Just got two questions for the time being:\n\n1. With 2K21 being skipped over for the more arcadey Battlegrounds this year, is the plan as is right now to do a WWE 2K game every two years to give more development time, or is this just a one time thing for now with the plan to go back to a WWE 2K simulation every year?\n\n\n2. With the overall legends selection within the WWE 2K franchise shrinking the last two years, was just curious about the process of selecting or signing legends for these games. Is getting legends something is responsible for getting independently with a fixed budget where guys like Hogan just take up more money to sign and so cuts are needed? Does WWE have much say in who you guys select for the game in general? \n\n\nThanks!

Is there ways where we can realistically have ways in which we can include superstars as in gear types/styles , hair , Makeup , accessories , I know it’s a lot of work to include superstars as it takes time but have you guys thought about this alternative? We would also love a better creation suite with multiple fabric/material types , better clothing options in which we have full control , we should have control over the way we want gears to fit (tight , baggy , slim , length , style) not only that , the hairstyles should be more customizable in which we can control the length , size , & overall look when it’s placed on a superstar! Lastly , as a personal problem I’ve had , I would like more space when it comes to image uploading into the game and an easier way to import other content when other creators upload gears , we should have an option to copy and paste without actually having to go into create a superstar and changing the gear to ring attire/manager attire!

I love to play wwe games online. I especially loved wwe 2k14. \n1. Can we see an adjustment to reversals? Especially any form of major reversals? On paper. It sounds good. But Ppl cheese them. So they do a finisher and pin. No skill needed. And most likely win. It’s the meta of online play. I hate I have to do that. Can we see major reversal ether adjusted or completely removed in the future games? Unblockable attacks work in other fighting games. Just not in WWE games.\n\n2. Also for online. Make it so reversals limits are the same. Or gone. I hate being a normal superstar with 3 bars. Just to fight a guy who put six reversal bars in his character.\n\n3. Remove the hud for the opponent so I can’t see what’s his momentum and vice versa. So when finishers occur. It’s a surprise. And not coz I saw they had it stored. Older wwe games like WWE 2k14 did this perfectly.\n\n## Comment ID fs85ahs with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs85ahs/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nThanks for doing this AMA Patrick, just one quick question.\n\nWill we be seeing some sort of cross-play integration between the different consoles and PC in time for the next WWE game?\n\n## Comment ID fs85jj9 with +1 score by [(Otb_liljosh13, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs85jj9/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nRoad to wrestlemania online, gm mode online?

Can we get accurate versions of wrestlers for what they used to look like. For example Kurt Angle '06 and Kurt Angle '01 simply just has hair on his head another issue is that both Kurt Angle character models are using Kurt Angle's recent face scan this really throws off the authenticity and experience of the game. We basically end up with a character model that's supposedly supposed to look like what they looked like from the year 2001 using a recent face scan and we end up with a product that's off you can still see the aging of the wrestlers. Samething with The Rock and The Rock '01 he simply just has hair on his head and you can still see the aging on the younger model aswell. We want these characters designed from the ground up because we obviously can't get or use a face scan. Can we also get more retro wrestlers like retro Thuganomics Cena retro Here Comes the Pain Brock Lesnar. Debut of retro American badass biker Undertaker the best version of the biker Undertaker in the year 2000 that version of him in WWE 2K14 and in SmackDown 1 and 2. Batista from his Evolution days and his Smackdown days when he had hair.

Are you looking at a bunch of new ways to innovate? Or would it be looking at the past games and seeing what made them work, and incorporating the features you can manage to import into a new game? \n\n- obviously very early to tell so could just be a short answer, but is there an overhaul to a MyCareer/Season Mode coming? The idea is good, a cinematic cutscene story, however was done much better in past games on PS2. More replayability for it would be fantastic....

I feel pushing them together in one mode is always going to have them conflict with one another, and that there are other ways to make Universe an engaging mode all the way through (Please check out the #4 post in the Universe feedback thread on the 2K forum for more on that).\n\nRambling aside, can you tell us whether or not you're going to keep GM Mode and Universe Mode separate and make sure to build on both toward their own respective purposes?\n\n## Comment ID fs7p3th with +1 score by [(the905guy11, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7p3th/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nIf the NBA team already has the license to use proper arenas.

I hope these are more questions than they are just me hawking my suggestions, but you know how it goes on these things.\n\n1) Are there any plans to make the wrestler AI feel more unique and individualized? When I'm fighting Rey Mysterio, or when I'm fighting the Big Show, I don't see any big difference in tactics or match flow besides the stats and the moveset. But sim sports games have always had stuff like tendencies, and at least some percentage of WWE games players are also Fire Pro World players, which gives you an unbelievable amount of customization on enemy wrestler AI/what AI vs. AI matches will look like. I also think old PS2 era WWE games got around this okay by making extremely  exaggerated animations of signature moves for the stars (Rock, Lesnar, Goldberg etc). For me, it seemed wild that people were getting up in arms about not getting to play as Lio Rush in 2K20 when playing as/against Stone Cold Steve Austin hasn't been exciting in 15 years.\n\n2) Any plans for create a story? I know it was supposed to be buggy/laggy in the X360/PS3 generation, but I think it would have been such a big hit with streaming. IIRC the VGCW guys got big right before Twitch became a thing, then the next versions of the game got rid of CAS. I can see the potential problems with content moderation, etc.\n\n## Comment ID fs7p4ns with +1 score by [(FrancisTB45, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7p4ns/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nAre there plans for a future general manager feature in the next-gen consoles?\n\n## Comment ID fs7p4oc with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7p4oc/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nIn regards to tag teams, factions, and other groups -- why do past teams not get included as entrances (moves, music, etc.), presentation and everything to do with teams feels like no one cares?\n\nFor instance, X-Pac is included in 2K20, but there is no Kane & X-Pac entrance. No movement and no music for them to enter together. Evolution is similar, you have Batista, Flair, Triple H and Orton, but no Evolution entrance movements.

I'm hoping it has a renaissance by the time the next game launches as it has been ignored for far too long.\n\n## Comment ID fs7qgg2 with +1 score by [(nv____, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7qgg2/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nSince it isn’t feasible to get rid of the download limit can separate them?

This a concern of mine since polling showed this very low. I am hoping this will be addressed as the possibility of full body morphing being added brings the concern of disturbing creations that I do not want to see, and I am also concerned children should not see. The second question is in regard to whether or not someone  on the WWE 2k team or with some of the power users would do some basic tutorials on how each of the create a modes function. Personally I think if you do they should posted on a 2k resource page somewhere. Finally regarding Spotify if you are to do a Spotify integration would you need premium to use it?

So iv a number of questions but feel free to answer any ones you like\n1) Will the focus just be next gen(PS5 etc) going forward? I personally feel like this is necessarily because of how much work the game needs and I would worry that cross gen development will hinder development\n2) My Career has not exactly been a success and I was wondering if it will be continuing or get replaced? Preferably with a season mode or some sort\n3) For me Universe mode has been the most important mode because of longevity and as a single player gamer I hope there can continue to being long term single player modes going forward, I sometimes feel like the games focus does more so be on short term modes like Showcase/MyCareer story/2KOriginals etc and was hoping that will change going forward\n4) is there any plans to rebuild the game from the ground up because the engine has been pretty flawed in the past? Kind of links to my Q1 as to why I hope the focus in next gen going forward as the game needs a lot of work.\n5) Something more light hearted but have you any favourite Wrestling games yourself and any particular feature/mode that you yourself want to bring to the game?\n\n## Comment ID fs7sslb with +1 score by [(Mintydeadman, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7sslb/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nWhen is WWE 2k19 going back on sale?

Nearly every game now gets a MASSIVE frame rate boost and decreased load times. So far, I've done this with Bioshock Remastered, The Quarry, and Midnight Suns and I've seen massive improvements in the overall play experience.\n\nAt this point, I think 2K Games needs to remove the launcher until they sort this out. Midnight Suns is not a particularly graphics heavy game (nor is Bioshock Remastered), so if someone with a RTX 3090 is struggling to get a decent frame rate, something is VERY broken with the 2K launcher.  It is making their games practically unplayable for most people, and I think this needs to be addressed by 2K. Considering people on EGS currently have no option for removing the launcher, I think 2K needs to not force it on people.\n\n### Comment ID j033rhl with +532 score by [(robdabank33, Reddit, 2022-12-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/zl26t5/removing_the_2k_launcher_for_midnight_suns_in/j033rhl/) (in reply to ID j02vdvz):\nIt really is crazy, that even an invasive anti-piracy measure would be eating up *that* amount of frames.\n\nThats got to be the most invasive anti-piracy checks ever, or the code is just atrociously bad.\n\nOr both, perhaps both.\n\n#### Comment ID j046rud with +208 score by [(M3wThr33, Reddit, 2022-12-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/zl26t5/removing_the_2k_launcher_for_midnight_suns_in/j046rud/) (in reply to ID j033rhl):\nWatch it be something like it logging the files it scans to check for piracy... and it scans that log file... which reports the scan... and it scans it again...\n\n#### Comment ID j04h73d with +66 score by [(belithioben, Reddit, 2022-12-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/zl26t5/removing_the_2k_launcher_for_midnight_suns_in/j04h73d/) (in reply to ID j033rhl):\nIt ends up wrapping around to a pro-piracy measure because the pirated version is better than the official one.\n\n#### Comment ID j04mfxw with +22 score by [(TheMichaelScott, Reddit, 2022-12-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/zl26t5/removing_the_2k_launcher_for_midnight_suns_in/j04mfxw/) (in reply to ID j033rhl):\nIt reminds me of the 2005 Sony CD rootkit that included malware.

A while ago we found this same trick to bypass the launcher and have had 0 crashes since. Anecdotal for sure, but I'd wager the 2K Launcher is responsible.\n\nThe 2K Launcher also resists being closed when Civ is open, saying that it's necessary to run the game, but that's just a complete lie, given that you can force close the launcher with task manager and the game runs fine (or just bypass it entirely). I've also witnessed it inexplicably downloading and uploading small amounts of data in the background, so it's effectively just malware in my eyes.\n\n#### Comment ID j048edq with +21 score by [(DBrody6, Reddit, 2022-12-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/zl26t5/removing_the_2k_launcher_for_midnight_suns_in/j048edq/) (in reply to ID j02yfua):\nYes it did, Civ6 and was way more prone to crashing with the bullshit installer.\n\nIt's effortless to disable though but still, the fact they added it at all is annoying.\n\n#### Comment ID j02yzkm with +82 score by [(Maelstrom52, Reddit, 2022-12-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/zl26t5/removing_the_2k_launcher_for_midnight_suns_in/j02yzkm/) (in reply to ID j02yfua):\nI haven't played Civ 6 in a while either, but my guess is yes it would.

Mostly miss, unfortunately. Performance wise it actually runs okay, pretty well in the actual battles, and the launcher doesn't even pop up though I do think it is still loading in the background.\n\nHowever, I was having issues getting my saves to sync across my desktop and deck, Steam cloud was saying they were synced but they were being placed in the wrong directory on the Deck and the game didn't see them. I found a work-around,  but then the saves didn't sync back to my PC and I had to manually copy them. \n\nThe devs have mentioned that they are looking into this issue and oddly enough the other day I went to play the game and the saves synced correctly, but then I had my first crash with the game and lost some progress (just dialog but it meant I had to run though it again).\n\nI'd wait a few weeks and see if they release any patches for Deck specifically because it seems like some esoteric issues that could easily be sorted out, rather than the game will just never work right on deck. I actually think it's a great fit.\n\nOh, and the game is phenomenal in its own right and it's really shitty to see how much hate it is getting for 2K's business practices when you can clearly tell there was a team that really believe in this project and, I believe, made something very special.\n\n#### Comment ID j04suwm with +1 score by [(Test_Subject_258, Reddit, 2022-12-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/zl26t5/removing_the_2k_launcher_for_midnight_suns_in/j04suwm/) (in reply to ID j048ewf):\nI was able to fix cloud saves and was okay dealing with the crashes but since the most recent update launched I can’t progress the game at all without crashing.

They should all be within the `Documents/My Games/Marvel's Midnight Suns folder`; the game with the 2K launcher saves to `Saved_Steam_--` while the non-launcher version saves to `Saved`.

I've done RTTs with 3 hour rounds that include set up. Some tournaments do 2:30 rounds. It requires both players to be very efficient with decisions and to know their rules very well. Very little looking rules or stats up. Having all your tools readily available. Thinking about what you're going to do while your opponent goes so you immediately start taking actions on your turn. It's a much more sterile way of playing, but still fun if you're into that.\n\nI think the biggest thing you can do to speed up is knowing the vast majority of your rules and stats by heart so as to not waste time by looking things up.\n\n### Comment ID l6xdto9 with +38 score by [(ducksbyob, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6xdto9/) (in reply to ID l6x5l8m):\nYeah, you are probably hitting the mail on the head there.

Look up 4 or 5 things, 10 minutes gone. Multiply this by a quick check of stats here, a double check of mission rules there ... And you've added an hour. You have to be very streamlined to get play down in time. It's something that takes deliberate practice, it's very much a choice to play that way.\n\n#### Comment ID l6y3amt with +6 score by [(DAIMOND545, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6y3amt/) (in reply to ID l6xdto9):\nThats a great start!

And that mostly comes with repetition.\n\n\nAnother is having groups of pre-counted dice so you don't need to count them up every time you do anything.\n\n\nThe big one of course is decision-making.

Serious question.  What do you find is the biggest timesink?  I've never heard of games lasting 8+ hours, even games between new players who don't know all the rules.\n\nMy early games were probably 3-5 hours depending on how quickly I got destroyed.  My casual games now are more in the 2-3 hour range.\n\nFor tournament games, I speed up the process by thinking a lot of things through before I even arrive, having a checklist written out, not talking as much as usual (in casual games I usually think out loud when it comes to my decision processes, give my opponent tips if they're struggling to decide what to do, just generally converse, etc.). \n\nAnd lastly, skip things that won't be impactful.  When shooting a Redemptor, open with the big guns to see if the target dies just from that.  Usually skip the storm bolters unless 1 wound could make all the difference.  Or if a unit of 20 Boyz charges 2 scouts, I just pick up my scouts.  Not worth the time to roll it out when the outcome is 99% determined.\n\nThose kinds of things can get a game down to 90-120 minutes (as long as your opponent is moving equally efficiently).  Chess clocks are kind of necessary to ensure neither player hogs all the time.\n\n### Comment ID l6y6mxh with +3 score by [(the-strange-ninja, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6y6mxh/) (in reply to ID l6x5l8m):\nAdding onto this, skipping some shooting if you know they won’t do much is helpful as well. I had 2 units of legionaries trying to take out a wave serpent on an objective yesterday. Skipped all of the pistol shots and just charged it. Killed it and saved quite a few mins on those shooting rolls.\n\nThat is also to say, efficient decision making include target selection. If you know which of your guns are worth shooting into different units, not only will it save you time on wasted rounds of shooting, but it will also kill your opponent faster.\n\n### Comment ID l6yhb9q with +2 score by [(tiptopjank, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6yhb9q/) (in reply to ID l6x5l8m):\nDoes it significantly quicken the game to play 1k or 1500?\n\n#### Comment ID l6yjbpx with +3 score by [(blacknight302, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6yjbpx/) (in reply to ID l6yhb9q):\nYup!

With chess clocks you have 1:15 to do all your stuff in a game (including saves during your opponent's turn).\n\n\nHonestly, start with smaller games if it's taking 7 hours at 2000 points. I'm assuming that's a lot of time looking up rules and strategems not even including the extra breaks needed for playing that long.\n\nPlay a game at 500 points. Remember to play on a smaller table at this level and use the core of your 2000 point list so you can get familiar with their rules and strategems that effect them. Really, play a few games with no strategems including rerolls and see how that goes. Then bring them back, then move up to 750, 1000ish,  1500ish,  and then 2000 until your casual games are coming in about 4 hours or so. Play these games with simple deployment, no secondary missions, and generous line of sight blocking.  Add  those in as you progress \n\nLook up \"Fast Rolling\" if you're not already batching up dice rolls for units with the same weapons. Get a box of 36 dice and put piles of 5 dice in front of you to make counting out large amounts of dice easier. Use a dice tray/box to keep dice together.\n\nGet some \"red sticks\" or a gaming ruler  for measuring common distances.  Work on recognizing when you just need to measure what matters (a model has 12\" movement but you're only moving it 6\", a gun can fire 24\" but it's target is obviously closer).\n\n## Comment ID l6xlf9s with +19 score by [(t0matit0, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6xlf9s/) (in reply to ID 1d75yqn):\nIdk how people play 2k in under 3hrs, it takes me closer to 4.\n\n### Comment ID l6yfm5q with +5 score by [(Frixinator, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6yfm5q/) (in reply to ID l6xlf9s):\nDo you need to look up datasheets?

Note that this includes setup, introduction of forces, and deployment.\n\nIn a casual game you're likely horsing around, joking, talking to other friends when they walk into the game store. If you're taking over 7 hours you're also probably breaking for food, getting drinks, that sort of thing. In tournament you're probably giving most of your attention to the game. You might still joke with your opponent, but if you're taking too long most tournaments require the use of chess clocks if a player requests one. Once your time runs out, you can only take required actions like rolling saves.\n\nThe #1 eater of clocks for new and casual players is analysis paralysis. \"Where should this unit move, where do I shoot, should I charge, should I CP reroll that?\". Even if it feels like you're only thinking for a couple of minutes, it's often longer than it feels and that time can compound very quickly. Tournament players will often have their first couple of turns planned out (move these units out to objectives, everything else stages for the next turn), will be quick with target identification (I am playing mostly Infantry so I don't really care about those Lascannon Havoks), and will have a game plan for what strats they're going to use the most over the course of the game. CP Reroll usually doesn't matter. They also use the time in their opponent's turn by planning out their next turns. Even if your gameplan falls apart due to poor saves or something, recovering and adapting will take significantly less time than trying to come up with a plan for each turn from scratch every turn.\n\nSomething else that really helps is playing by intent. You openly announce what you're doing and why, then do not have to precisely measure everything with perfect pinpoint accuracy. For example, there's a trick where you place your unit just outside of 1 inch from a Ruin wall, which will force the opponent (assuming they are on 28mm bases or larger) to go all the way around the wall in order to complete a charge, and can limit what of theirs actually gets into engagement range and therefore what gets to fight. You COULD take 10 minutes measuring every single model to be the actual perfect distance, or you could play by intent and get them close enough, and simply inform your opponent this is what you are doing. It is important to note that you should do this while you are actually moving the unit, and not announcing it in their Charge phase because you realized you didn't do it and ate a charge. It's a tool for more fluid, faster games, not Ctrl+Z for mistakes. Another example for movement, you can say \"I want to move this unit here, but I don't want to be visible to that tank\". As long as you have the movement to do so and your opponent agrees you do, you can just get close enough instead of walking around the table and bending over the tank to triple-check that you won't take an Overwatch.\n\nSome other tips include: \n\n* Knowing your rules and relevant FAQs. I like to keep a cheat sheet on me, and I print up enough for my opponents when I go to an event so they can quickly reference my stats and rules. I also recommend putting bookmarks in your codex, and marking Rules sections you commonly refer to as a Favorite in the app so you can pull it up quickly. Looking things up and figuring out how to deal with an overlapping of rules is most likely the biggest eater of your time outside of analysis paralysis. The Core Rule Book recommends rolling to see who decides what happens if you can't figure it out in a timely manner, and since you're playing casually I would agree with doing that, then looking up the actual interaction/ruling later. The Competitive Warhammer subreddit has a pinned thread specifically for asking rules questions and clarifications. Heck, even in tournament sometimes a judge can get a ruling wrong. 40k is a complicated game.\n\n* Roll faster by keeping up with your opponent. When they announce they're attacking you with 10 chainswords, pick up 10 dice, then discard/add to that handful as they miss/get Sustained Hits. By the time you get to the stage you're rolling your saves, you should have roughly the number you need and can roll more quickly instead of taking that time right then to count out your dice.\n\n* In a related vein, keep your dice in easily counted groups. If your dice are sorted to one side in groups of 4, you can very quickly and easily grab what you need instead of reaching into your dice bag to count them out.\n\n* Do not shoot weapons that don't matter. Your Gants might shave a wound off a Land Raider, but most of the time it will make no difference and you will have suceeded in spending 5 minutes rolling to not change the game state. Similarly, know when to not bother rolling at all. If a unit of BT Bladeguard declares their attacks against a unit of 4 Gants, just remove them. Does this deny a model the chance for a cinematic and heroic last stand? Yes, but the chances of that are extremely remote to begin with, and likely would make no difference to the game anyway.\n\n* I see others advocating for movement trays. Do not use movement trays. The easy way to move large blobs of models is to move the front models, then the back models, and simply fill in the middle. If you have a block of models like I see in your picture, you could even just measure the corner models then fill in the rest.\n\n* Speaking of your picture, I see small wooden(?) markers that I can only assume are the Objectives. I recommend sourcing neoprene Objective markers, which will mark the objective itself and the area around it you have to be in to control it so you don't have to measure 3 inches out to see who controls what. Footprints for your ruins can also help by making it clear what is indide a Ruin and what isn't, and would allow you to move the physical wall out of the way to better measure movement through it.\n\nEDIT: Bullet point formatting borked.\n\n### Comment ID l6ybz1a with +1 score by [(Dawson_VanderBeard, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6ybz1a/) (in reply to ID l6y1j34):\ni'll make the case for super dense movement trays for the horde of models (that are basically a big wound counter) and then use 4-5 models as pickets that represent the edges of the blob. might take a bit more opponent cooperation because of coherency and RAW\n\n#### Comment ID l6yfp61 with +1 score by [(AsherSmasher, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6yfp61/) (in reply to ID l6ybz1a):\nThat will run you into issues if you ever want to do something like moving partially through a wall (how many are on either side), and could cause issues with LoS, coherency, and wargear placement.

If it's looking up or discussing rules, then just keep playing, you'll get better at it.\n\nIf you spend most of the time thinking where to move etc, then play with a chess clock. We play with 120min for each player, starting with deployment, so army explanation, mission draw and setup is not in that time included.\n\nWe finish almost every game in time. Sure, we make some mistakes because we are under time pressure, but that's for both players so it's even. Of one time runs out, the other player who has time left can continue, only saving throws are allowed for the player with no time left.\n\nWe first were all against playing with clock, but now we don't want to play without, because games last for 6-8 hours, everyone takes so much time overthinking every move.\n\n## Comment ID l6yk1v1 with +1 score by [(spirit-host, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6yk1v1/) (in reply to ID 1d75yqn):\nYou’re going to need more whiskey\n\n## Comment ID l6yusig with +1 score by [(ArabicHarambe, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6yusig/) (in reply to ID 1d75yqn):\n3 hours is easy if you play like me and get tabled turn 2\n\n## Comment ID l6yzxf7 with +1 score by [(Sairun88, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6yzxf7/) (in reply to ID 1d75yqn):\n2.5-3 hours is standard tournament rounds.\n\nYou get there by knowing your profiles, good dice management, quick decision making/making decisions in your opponents turn and overall efficiency. \n\nFor example, I organise my dice into piles of 5 so I can count them out quickly but in a pinch I'll absolutely roll the wounds in the tray for my saves instead of re-counting.\n\nI've seen players have a specific bag of dice for one big activation - If you know that squad of 20 gants is going to put out 40 shots at full strength, and is likely to be at full strength for a couple of activations thanks to momma tervigon, might be worth having a specific pile of dice that you roll just for that. I've seen Tau players do that for the index CIB Crisis death brick for example.\n\nThere will also be instances playing a horde army where you just don't activate some things because they aren't worth the time - your army will generally win by standing places, not killing things. As such, you *may* choose not to bother shooting termagants at a stompa or bolters at a land raider depending on the time and game state.\n\nEdit: for what it's worth, when I started playing again a few years ago, 2k took maybe 5/6 hours. 2.45 is a comfortable pace now.\n\n## Comment ID l6z4d8u with +1 score by [(GodzillaMilk69, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6z4d8u/) (in reply to ID 1d75yqn):\nDude bro please get movement trace it’ll make your games go half as fast\n\n### Comment ID l6z9oa2 with +1 score by [(ducksbyob, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6z9oa2/) (in reply to ID l6z4d8u):\nWhat is movement trace,\n\n#### Comment ID l6za016 with +1 score by [(GodzillaMilk69, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6za016/) (in reply to ID l6z9oa2):\nMovement trays, my bad.

It's not that we don't allow rolls like that to be made, it's just in this instance shooting with boys usually doesn't result in a single kill unless I get lucky against most of my buddies armies and the time it takes to do those rolls adds up quick when you have 60ish boys on the table, all to usually end up accomplishing very little/not even killing something. It also helps to not be to big of a stickler for measurements / line of sight at times, especially if you guys are decent at eyeballing it IE if me or my friends are making a move that's shorter then the movement range and we know it we usually just tell the other to not worry about measuring (IE unit is moving the last few inches to objective and they can clearly make it there with movement left over.

This lets you do 3 rounds in a tournament, and get in an hour lunch for a total of 9 ish hours (10 minutes between rounds). This is often not enough time for everyone to finish their games, however, so the scores end up reflecting that in a lot of cases. You might have a 3 round game with final scores at like 24-30 or something real low like that.

Even if it doesn't go that way, if you cut out socialization and robotically declare intent and roll dice you can consistently knock out games in about 3 hours. (Tournament games regularly end at the bottom of turn 3/4 because they start a 2 hour and 50 minute clock the milisecond pairings are posted and then use player placed terrain though :/.) If you're chatting with your real life friend and drinking and discussing how turns could have gone differently, it rapidly becomes an all-night affair to finish a game.\n\nAs for \"why are my games slow,\" when you have a huge amount of models the turns don't scale the same - normally both players have lost so much stuff by the end of turn 3 that turns 4 and 5 go much more quickly as you both take a few calculated risks to grab points and pass, but when you drop 100 dudes on the table, there are still 50 dudes to roll dice for when half your army is gone lol, plus horde units are usually somewhat weak so the other player still has a combat effective army to continue trying to kill you off of objectives with.\n\nThere's also the textbook answer; the game takes twice as long when you have to actually reference your rules. Once you're settled in with your army list of choice you know all the datasheets and relevant stratagems by heart, so you just say what you want to do and what the effect/profile is.\n\n## Comment ID l7023na with +1 score by [(lowqualitylizard, Reddit, 2024-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l7023na/) (in reply to ID 1d75yqn):\nTwo and a half hours\n\nBut those people most likely no their rules the best because they have to.

A 2k game should take about 90 minutes to resolve. Why is it taking you so long? Do you not know the rules, do you not know your armies, or something else?\n\nI don't play tournaments anymore but I do still attend narrative events which play similarly. I'll usually get 6 or more test games in with a list that doesn't change between games so I can know what all of my relevant rules are. That helps me speed up my play dramatically.\n\n## Comment ID l711rry with +1 score by [(son_of_wotan, Reddit, 2024-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l711rry/) (in reply to ID 1d75yqn):\n3 hours is enough for most 2K games. Last weekend, I managed to finish all 3 of my games under 2 hours, even tho I was the TO :D Friendly and practice games take usually 4 hours.\n\nFrom the tournament standpoint, I did everything to reduce time wasted on logistics or administration. Tables are numbered and easily found. Terrain is already set up and is the same for all 3 games. There is 15 minutes between announcing the pairings and the start of the round, so everyone has time to find their opponent, transport their armies to the table, take a quick smoke/leak/drink or whatever. We also supply trays to make it easier to transport armies.\n\nFrom my years as a player and TO these are my \"findings\" what are the time wasters:\n\n**Administration**: read the mission pack, know what missions you are playing. If possible, read the lists once they are published, to cut down time explaining army lists. Use an app to track your points (set up all the games in advance). Use a dice rolling app if you play hordes. Only have the stuff you need for the army. Like only bring the datasheets you use, leave the rest at home. Use a compact and informative army list. Have a cheat sheet to reference your rules/profiles if you don't know them by heart.  You'd be surprised how much time is wasted by constantly leafing through codexes or those horrendous Army Builder lists (sooo. much. waste. of. paper...)\n\n**Logistics**: Sooner or later you will realize, that you need proper logistical solutions. Which in my experience is some variation of magnetized carry case. Yeah, wrapping stuff in tissues and putting them in boxes might be cheaper, but the constant taking out and putting away, and the space all that stuff takes up wastes time. Also even in proper foam, stuff constantly breaks. Trying to find glue and glueing your minis back together is another time waster. And some people never learn. So have a magnetic carry case and put your miniatures on trays. I even seen people to come to tournaments with those troleys you see in cantinas :D For horde armies, movement trays are recomended.\n\n**Tools/accessories/dice:** This may sound like a no brainer, but you'd be surprised. Have a working and proper tape measure. Laser pointer, Measuring sticks, like 9\" for deep strikes, 3\", etc. Tokens and markers for buffs. *Have. Enough. Dice!* I cannot stress enough that having the right amount and variety of dice is crucial. It's annoying when people roll up to a tournament with 20 dice or even worse and odd number :D Have separate dice for wound markers and command points, so you don't pick them up by mistake. Have at least 2, but 3 different colored dice, so you can roll multiple profiles together and have at least 40 of one of them. If you are not good at recognizing things, use clear dice. No shame in using numbered dice, instead of dots. Also there are a lot of cool looking dice, but when you have to pick out 1s and 2s from a pile of 60 then it get's hard with all the patterns and type of markings. Also use dice trays. Also you may know your own dice, and you are good at recognizing the patterns, but your oppoenent may not and them constantly stopping you to look at your dice is again a time waster.\n\n**Unit markings:** Espacially in horde armies, but even if you spam the same units, it helps if you can easily differentiate which unit is which. \n\n**Know the Core rules:** This may be the most annoying, because 95% of the rules question I receive during a tournament is explaining core rules. How ruins work. How engagement range works. How cover saves work with 3+ saves. Etc. If you know the core rules, 95% of the so called \"rules disputes\" don't arise to begin with.\n\n**Know your own rules** or at least have a cheat sheet at hand. Having to refference the same rules again and again takes time. So either learn your army rules and unit stats or have a clear cheat sheet/reference. Datacards and stratagem cards are quite handy :)\n\n**It's a tournament:** you are there to play and have fun, but it's a tournament. You won't have time to look at other tables, there is no time for small talk and tell stories. If you can multitask, you can talk while you are doing things. If you are not good at multitasking, no one will be mad at you if you focus on your little toy soldiers. Be there physically but also mentally. If you need a smoke break, do that during your opponents movement turn, not when it's your turn. Stand up to your jealous girlfriend who pesters you for constant status updates to leave you some peace. Try not to organize your wedding during a tournament.\n\n**Play by intent:** During movement phase state your intent where you place your models. Like this model is behind the building, you shouldn't be able to see it from this and this angle. This model is touching the objective. This way you can avoid having to double check LoS during alter phases or gotcha moments, where you opponent tries to capitalize on small errors. Of yourse offer the same courtesy to them, so if their intent was to hide that big bug behind a ruin, don't all of a sudden tell them, that you can see them and you are going to shoot them. This again reduces the disputes. But don't let people abuse this.\n\n**Have a game plan:** I know that this game is hard and not everyone is a tactical and strategic genius. But have an idea what you want to do and how to achive it. Don't be reactive, be proactive, meaning, plan your moves during your opponents turn and not when it's your turn. You can check LoS and measure distances anytime, so why not using your opponents turn to do so? It's not 4th edition, where you were not allowed to pre-measure :D\n\nTl/dr.: it's the small things that add up to a lot of wasted time.\n\n## Comment ID l71404r with +1 score by [(corrin_avatan, Reddit, 2024-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l71404r/) (in reply to ID 1d75yqn):\nOP, can you clarify a comment you made, you're saying that the game you had pictured, you played from 3pm to midnight ***and you only ended up finishing the top of the 2nd battle round/the person who got to go first's 2nd turn?***\n\nThere seems to be something absolutely wrong here, as that means on average each turn you guys are doing are long enough that even \"longer\" tournament games of 3 hours are able to fit within them.\n\nAre you guys only playing with 5 total dice?

Think about when you take stock of the table. Do you each spend maybe 5-10 minutes in your command phases thinking about what to do and where to move? That's at least 1 hour just there. If you plan your moves while your opponent plays. Know where you have shooting lanes, know how you want to move to achieve secondaries. Know the way to objectives, if you're suddenly screened out suring your opponents movement phase, think about how to counter while your opponent plays on.

It does depend on my opponent. I have played the game for a long time so we don't spend very long dealing with rules uncertainties. I have one very new friend and we usually play for close to 6 hours, but a lot of that time is him trying to think and do good choices with limited experience.\n\nWhen i play against other very experienced players a game is less than 4 hours even without the clocks, but that is because we know the rules and our unit stats. Generally if your opponent has some games behind them, you don't need to know their army rules in detail. Just know your own stuff and the basic game rules. There is a lot of downtime to save by just responding quicly to what happens on the table.",

It's also got a good roster as the 30 Years of WrestleMania gave you lots of legends from Hulk Hogan to Big John Studd to Goldberg (these guys were gone for YEARS). \n\nCreation is fine as you got Superstar Threads, allowing you to have three attires of recolored attires. Superstar Heads was introduced, which is just a precursor of today's creation systems, but very limited on you can use with it. Also the only way to play as Roddy Piper.

After login at [https://accounts.2k.com/](https://accounts.2k.com/en-US), if you visit [https://accounts.2k.com/v2/me](https://accounts.2k.com/v2/me) it should show you what platforms have been connected to your 2k account. This is their API. I saw that I have 5 platforms connected and Game Center is among them. \n\nFrom their account page, I could see other platforms except for game center. Other platforms can be unlinked by visiting the unlink endpoints like [https://accounts.2k.com/auth/nintendo/unlink](https://accounts.2k.com/auth/nintendo/unlink). But it didn't work for gamecenter. [https://accounts.2k.com/auth/gamecenter/unlink](https://accounts.2k.com/auth/gamecenter/unlink) redirects me to a 404 page.\n\nI will continue trying to contact Aspyr support.

I stopped caring for a while but tried to get it working again. In the past I contacted 2K and Aspyr but only got tips from them. I just got it working again but there was a lot of trial and error as I also used Steam to play as well. Here is a list of things to try (most are listed in the thread in one way or another):\n\n1. Disconnect 2K from all other accounts, steam, epic, google (this is accessible on 2K's site)\n2. Log out of 2K in all Civ VI games (whether steam, switch, PS, Xbox, etc)\n3. Restore purchases (on ios: \"Get More Content\" -> \"Restore Purchases\")\n4. Logging out of your Apple ID (go the \"Settings\" app, click your apple ID name in the top, under \"iCloud\", \"Media & Purchases\", \"Find My\", etc, there should be a \"Sign Out\" option)\n\nNote: Every time you change something, reset the app (not just exiting out, in the Home screen, swiping up and pausing so you see what apps are open and swipe civ vi away). Yes its tedious but changes won't go into affect until you do that (they also say wait 15 min but I'm impatient)\n\nOption 4 is what worked for me most recently. For that though, I logged out, opened Civ and the option to login to 2K was available (the logo turned Red from Grey previously) but you need iCloud in order to connect 2K. So with Civ still open in the background, I logged back in and did not allow my iCloud to merge. Then I reset the app and it was working. I know the iCloud merge is probably not possible for everyone but it was what worked. \n\nIt seems like in order to make this work, you need your ios game to believe this is your only civ/2k account. It's stupid and you would think after years it would be fixed but alas. May your achievements not be deleted and your clouds connect.\n\n## Comment ID ev0wciq with +1 score by [(Nickjrock, Reddit, 2019-07-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/ch8qpi/impossible_to_login_to_2k_account_on_civ_6_ios/ev0wciq/) (in reply to ID ch8qpi):\nSame here\n\n### Comment ID ev0wpiq with +1 score by [(crackofdawn, Reddit, 2019-07-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/ch8qpi/impossible_to_login_to_2k_account_on_civ_6_ios/ev0wpiq/) (in reply to ID ev0wciq):\nI've tried everything.

That’s… I can”t say I’m surprised but I certainly am disappointed.\n\nBefore I continue writing, I’d like to thank you for your patience with any and all grammatical errors I make. English is not my first language.\n\nI figured out a way to fix this issue that  I had just now, though. This worked for me but I cannot guarantee that it works for anybody else.\n\nI honestly don’t remember how but I managed to get the  2k logo to not be greyed out. But I did (keep reading, even if you haven’t been able to do this, please!) Then connected my 2K account through the app.  \nthis caused a whole bunch of issues.\n\n\\- The 2k logo was red but said I was not logged in to it.  \n\\- Clicking the logo  prompted me to log in to my 2K account again. Tried doing that, and it said that my game center account was already linked to another 2K account.\n\nAt this point, after some cussing, I went to the 2K webpage and checked my connections. I was indeed connected to my game center account. But then why wouldn’t  the game center recognise this and make the connection?\n\nOdd.\n\nI disconnected Game Center from the connections and tried to log in through the civ game on my iPad. The exact same thing happened again. insane as I am, I did this a couple of times, expecting different results. Surprise - The exact thing happened.\n\nI finally realised that it was possible to account through the K2 webpage not use the app. So I tried that. it connected properly once I had restarted the app.  \nI obviously can’t test the theory but I suspect that using their website to connect with apple as opposed to through the  game app itself might have sorted this out for me sooner. But, as I said, it’s but a theory. I’d genuinely love hearing the result of that should anybody try it (So if your 2K logo is grey, I would appreciate it if you entertained my idea and gave it a go, worth a try, right?).\n\nI am yet to try to start a cross-platform game with somebody. Will edit this post with an update about that once I have. For some reason I’m  not expecting a smooth ride.\n\n  \nEDIT\n\nSo I managed to set up a cloud game with my partner who’s playing on their PC through steam. It runs pretty well. Takes a while to sync the saves/turns and the game restarts for each new turn, but I don’t have many complains about it and am kind of surprised it wasn’t more difficult than just.. setting it up as usual. So yay for that \\^\\^\n\n## Comment ID hsnt19c with +1 score by [(AtreyusPath, Reddit, 2022-01-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/ch8qpi/impossible_to_login_to_2k_account_on_civ_6_ios/hsnt19c/) (in reply to ID ch8qpi):\nUpdate guys!!!!!

I was just looking for cloud saves. Found no answers online and the FAQs don't even mention a disabled state for the 2k button.\n\n*Preface:* *I downloaded Civ6 from the respective Apple App Stores (iOS, iPadOS, MacOS). Solution may differ if from Epic or Steam.* \n\n**Game Center:**\n\nFirst and foremost, the connection to Civ6 servers requires Game Center. Without it, you're offline. You need to have GameCenter enabled on your device. When you launch the app, if you see a Game Center notification that you're signed in, then you know you're good here. \n\n**Log In and Link Accounts:**\n\n*(I honestly don't understand the mechanics of this one, or if it's even necessary in addition to Game Center, but I took an overkill approach)* \n\nOn both the native browser (Safari) and the default browser (Chrome for me), sign into your 2k Account. If you haven't already, link your 2k Account anywhere you can (I linked Steam, Epic, and Google). \n\n**Close, Relaunch, Verify:**\n\nThird: Make sure you're logged into all of those linked accounts on your browser(s) (2K, Epic, Steam, Gmail for me). Close / Quit Civ6 completely. Re-launch it. Verify Game Center sign-in message appears. 2k account button (bottom right) should work now. \n\nIf this doesn't work for you, let me know the situation (device, download platform, etc.) and I can offer some troubleshooting advice. \n\n*Thoughts*\n\n*This game was released in 2016, so I will accept that you need to jump through invisible hoops to get this to work if it doesn't work the first time. However, I will not have sympathy for a shotty implementation in Civ7.*",

Hurr hurr.\n\nMy group is mostly interested in 1k games. Quick games that won't take too long for our newbie selves.\n\nSo there are tons of resources on how to play 2k games. How many units you should take. What types of units to fill your army with. How to transport them. When to charge. How you should move across the board. What's best for armies at 2k. Which is fair, it feels like 2k is how 40k was intended to be played.\n\nMy question is are there any resources that can talk about how a 1k game differs? Or failing that, does anyone have any information they've picked up in playing their own games?\n\nThe armies feel as though they have to be wuite different. Some of the best units in some armies are simply too expensive to use in a 1k list. Or you can't take as many units that help them.\n\nHow do you take a good balance of unit types? How do you control the board with less units? How do you take objectives and hold while having to simultaneously take others with fewer units? How does limiting games to 1k change some of the better or worse armies in the game?\n\nThanks very much for any insight you might be able to offer.\n\n\n## Comment ID kwfnbfr with +14 score by [(SaiBowen, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwfnbfr/) (in reply to ID 1bn2yzr):\n1k games sacrifice a lot of balance to be only nominally shorter, imo.\n\nDon't get me wrong, some playstyles jump up playtime dramatically from 1k to 2k, but if you know the rules and you know your army I would guess adding that second 1000points probably comes to less than an hour extra of playtime for the average game.\n\nI recently pushed my group from 1k to 2k and games take 30-40 minutes longer but are way more fun and feel a lot more balanced overall.\n\n### Comment ID kwfqiao with +4 score by [(hypershrew, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwfqiao/) (in reply to ID kwfnbfr):\nYep, people just tend to field more infantry in 1k games and leave the monsters/vehicles at home.\n\n#### Comment ID kwh7y35 with +5 score by [(Squallvash, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwh7y35/) (in reply to ID kwfqiao):\nYou'd think that, but my brother built an all monsters Nids list that was just too hard to deal with overall. \n\nNot really a \"that guy\" move because he was just playing the models he found interesting. \n\nHe's currently playing a list of all Scions and 1 Valkyrie.

It is also typically worth leaning more into smaller units for more flexibility.

Several armies perform really well at lower points where as some just dont have enough to really make an impact.  \n\nFor instance knights should be banned as you arent going to be able to take enough to really do much against them.  I would look to have 300 points of scoring units, 300 of anti-infantry and 300 of anti tank. lists should probably also contain the entire contents of a combat patrol with exception of the characters or considerations made for combat patrols like deathguard and thousand sons.  \n\nEscalation style games are really worth doing where you start with even less points and work your way up to 2k, with jumps of 500 points every few weeks to a month.  Its very easy to fall into the trap of just bring the biggest thing and shoot each other of the table without some some guidelines made in good faith.\n\n## Comment ID kwfr6e8 with +5 score by [(hypershrew, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwfr6e8/) (in reply to ID 1bn2yzr):\n1k points of what?\n\nSounds like a silly question, but a 2k army of knights will take less time to play than a 1k army of tiny infantry squads, all armed with unique weapons and layered buffs and so on. In smaller point games, people tend to be reluctant to bring the more expensive units like monsters or vehicles. Even elites like terminators are less common at that point range, as they’d take up around 20% of your army for just 5 minis. \n\nIn theory, 1k is quicker to play than 2k, but often in practise the difference is negligible. \n\nHowever, it’s up to you and your opponent and what you want to play - if you prefer lots of infantry, then perhaps 1k games will be quicker and more fun for you!\n\n## Comment ID kwgoxgq with +3 score by [(Any_Recognition_3068, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwgoxgq/) (in reply to ID 1bn2yzr):\n1K on the smaller board (30x44”) easily becomes ‘bring your buddies to the center and let’s duke it out”. \n\n1K on the larger board (44x60”) is more interesting to me.\n\n### Comment ID kwgqw9q with +6 score by [(Capital_Tone9386, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwgqw9q/) (in reply to ID kwgoxgq):\nYou'll then be happy to know that the core rules themselves state that 1k games have to be played on a minimum size of 44x60 (the mission packs state the minimal battlefield size for each army size)\n\n#### Comment ID kwgrxuh with +3 score by [(Any_Recognition_3068, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwgrxuh/) (in reply to ID kwgqw9q):\nAh, I was under the impression that it was the smaller board.\n\nWas it different in 9th?\n\n## Comment ID kwj01nt with +3 score by [(Consistent-Brother12, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwj01nt/) (in reply to ID 1bn2yzr):\nThe big difference I've found between 1k and 2k games is that because resource management is such a big aspect of the game, losing a unit makes a much bigger impact and decisions have to be made a bit more carefully.

I think if sub 2k it's critical to find a nice rule 0 set to play with so that no one is overpowering the board really... honestly I've given it some thought and 1k games are fine with people that are more wanting a balanced game but 2k is the goto especially with new people or playing the game at a balanced point.

(To be honest, I've been the one pushing the points up because I've got the most experience so far out of our group with 10th specifically and want to try some bigger lists.)\n\nIn 9th, my group found our sweet spot to be right around 1.5k. Big enough to bring some fun models, but time conscious. We're also solidly in the beerhammer category though so games typically take longer than they should, lol. We're all pretty veteran players with plenty of models, we just found 1.5k to be the most fun in 9th in time and pacing. Not sure how 10th will shake out.

I've found the game has generally been balanced around 2k games though, and in my opinion playing 1k breaks the game in certain situations - for instance anything durable that can regen wounds (like Old One Eye & unit, or even worse a super heavy tank & enginseer) can be almost impossible to deal with at 1k as a lot of armies just don't have the firepower to kill it quickly or the option to ignore it.\n\n## Comment ID k1okfb6 with +2 score by [(Dekowurst, Reddit, 2023-09-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/16or6p8/does_anyone_ever_play_less_than_2k_games/k1okfb6/) (in reply to ID 16or6p8):\nOur group of friends tried to but one friend was not up for that because he wants to field at least 2k points.\n\nIt has to be said that we often play 2vs2 so it means that the 4k points on the board per side take time.

I’ve recently moved towns and joined a very chill club, so chill that a lot of the time is spent nattering and going to see pivotal points of other games so often turn 3 was a mythical and rarely seen event at 1500pts let alone 2k. (Very different to my previous clubs where a 2k game could be hashed out in under an hour and a half) as such the whole club decided to move to 1000pts and honestly it’s great. \n\nIt’s a really fun point level because even if someone brings a mega combo of doom it doesn’t have the support it needs to actually win, so it has led to more varied and interesting lists as you can’t bring every tool you would at 2k. We also had a lot of fun with boarding action which is 500pts (you should definitely play boarding action!)\n\n## Comment ID k1ougau with +1 score by [(DeathGuard1978, Reddit, 2023-09-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/16or6p8/does_anyone_ever_play_less_than_2k_games/k1ougau/) (in reply to ID 16or6p8):\nAt my gaming club we cut right down to skirmish games kill team and Warcry, for normal games 500pts is the go to, sometimes 1000pts, anything else takes too long for us.\n\n## Comment ID k1ougjn with +1 score by [(Chipperz1, Reddit, 2023-09-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/16or6p8/does_anyone_ever_play_less_than_2k_games/k1ougjn/) (in reply to ID 16or6p8):\n1) Yeah, all the time.  1k games are a ton of fun and Combat Patrol is a blast.\n\n2) Honestly, not as much as people online will say.  It's easier to specialise your army, but as a result it's as easy to screw up and bring something that is useless against your opponent's list so trying to be more tactical still makes more sense than taking all tanks or something.  A *lot* of the complaints are true of 2k games too - new players don't have the tools or the skills to beat skew lists anyway, and an arsehole is an arsehole whether they're playing Combat Patrol or Apocalypse.\n\n## Comment ID k1p1i15 with +1 score by [(Vividworlds, Reddit, 2023-09-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/16or6p8/does_anyone_ever_play_less_than_2k_games/k1p1i15/) (in reply to ID 16or6p8):\nI love playing all point sizes \nIf you and your opponent get the rules down \nYou can play 2k in about 1 and a half hours on average\n\n## Comment ID k1q8l2e with +1 score by [(Melodic-Pirate4309, Reddit, 2023-09-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/16or6p8/does_anyone_ever_play_less_than_2k_games/k1q8l2e/) (in reply to ID 16or6p8):\nMy group has been playing 1k games to get us back into the swing of 40k, especially because a lot of us have started new armies. \n\n2k is what most people play because the game feels most balanced at that points level, at least for most armies. 2k points allows you to bring forth more of a build with your army than 1500 or 1k can. The feel of some armies at 1k vs 2k is drastically different, especially because you're less likely to see as many vehicles, high damage weaponry or high amounts of infantry as compared to something like a 2k game. You have to bring only what you can't live without at 1k where at 2k you're offered a bit more wiggle room to work on things like synergies.\n\n## Comment ID k1r0ca3 with +1 score by [(APhysicistAbroad, Reddit, 2023-09-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/16or6p8/does_anyone_ever_play_less_than_2k_games/k1r0ca3/) (in reply to ID 16or6p8):\n2k is a special big game for me and my bud.

Once a licensing agreement ends the company can no longer make money off of the license. Could be character's, sponserhips, soundtracks etc.   \n  \nI doubt WWE is paying to keep soundtracks for the games since they won't even pay for the licensing for PPVs. Plus legends who are not under contract.  \n\nThen again they are a publicly traded business who needs to appease investors and getting people to re-buy the game, similar to 2k, will help their stock and make investors happy.

So they may have 20 servers each with 5GB to get to that point. Virtually, they may say 10 servers is dedicated to our new game, 5 is dedicated to WWE, and 5 is dedicated to another 2K sports game.\n\nAt any time they can increase or decrease resources and say Ok, well our new title is really popular, lets take 1 WWE server and 1 other game server and add it to the popular game. This is all done virtually without needing physical hardware.\n\nThey CAN opt to add more physical hardware to the pool, so they could add another server and increase the overall amounts of pooled resources but these are expensive.\n\nI think it comes down to as you mention, if the server is not popular, they reassign resources and after a point there are so many games running that the resources are spread thin so they want to shut down anything they can so they can allocate those resources to other functions.\n\nHowever, its really just because they are greedy. The resources are there, and most likely they all have more than they need and they just want to force everyone to the new game. I think its very anti-consumer that they should down servers this fast and it is a major consideration for me with any new title.\n\n### Comment ID lru8a9l with +4 score by [(jordygrant1, Reddit, 2024-10-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/1g38vmc/2k_games_lifespan_is_a_joke/lru8a9l/) (in reply to ID lru5waf):\n\"Thousands\"\n\n## Comment ID lrukm6f with +2 score by [(AmptiShanti, Reddit, 2024-10-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/1g38vmc/2k_games_lifespan_is_a_joke/lrukm6f/) (in reply to ID 1g38vmc):\nIt wasn’t like that up until recently though kind of a bummer\n\n## Comment ID lrvnf7v with +2 score by [(Prior_Dealer2146, Reddit, 2024-10-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/1g38vmc/2k_games_lifespan_is_a_joke/lrvnf7v/) (in reply to ID 1g38vmc):\nNot defending them, but two years has been the lifespan for NBA 2k for as long as I remember.

I've had multiple people tell me that they didn't understand what they were supposed to be doing in their new roles as the org restructured for the third time. \n\nLack of Development Opportunities: They've discussed something about career paths but nothing has come of this in years.

Water seeks its own level. And the watermark is high here.\r\n\r\nEveryone here has met two tenets: Exceptional talent and exceptional character. We have a no a-holes policy. No level of skill or ability excuses toxic personalities. We believe Trust matters most towards an environment of psychological safety where we can take risks to innovate and grow to achieve excellence in all we do.\r\n\r\nWe laugh a LOT here and we work hard. We believe that you can bring your best and whole self to work and that will make you, the team and game better. We value each other as people first. \r\n\r\nI truly look forward to going to work every Monday. I've been fortunate to work in an Industry I love for many years. I'm even more fortunate to be happier than I've ever been in my work at this stage of my career. \r\n\r\n31st Union is a unique team of amazing people. I'm grateful and humbled to be a part of it.",

      "# [2K Games Appears to Be Developing an Unannounced Remake by www.facebook.com, Alessio Palumbo on 2024-07-08](https://wccftech.com/2k-games-appears-to-be-developing-an-unannounced-remake/)\nIt looks like 2K Games is developing an unannounced remake of one of its franchises. As often happens in these cases, the rumor started when MP1st spotted on a LinkedIn resume of a 2K Games 3D artist and Motion Capture Animator the following list of games:\n\nNew Mafia game\n\nNew BioShock game\n\nSupermassive Games project codenamed Erebus (and canceled)\n\nUpcoming Unannounced Remake\n\nWe already knew that Hangar 13 (which recently released Top Spin 2K25) was making a new entry in the Mafia franchise. Studio General Manager Roman Hladík confirmed as much in August 2022, when the series was celebrating its twentieth anniversary:\n\nI'm happy to confirm we've started work on an all-new Mafia project! While it's a few years away and we can't share anything more right now, we're really excited to keep working on this beloved franchise and to entertain our players with new stories.\n\nThe same goes for BioShock, of course. The new installment in the dystopian first-person shooter franchise was announced in late 2019, and yet Cloud Chamber is still ramping up recruitment for the project. The third project is also interesting. Supermassive Games partnered with 2K Games to make The Quarry, which launched in June 2022 to a very positive (9/10) review here on Wccftech. It looks like they were making another game codenamed Erebus; however, it was eventually canceled, which may explain the studio's massive layoffs of a third of its staff a few months ago.\n\nThe news of the day is, however, the unannounced remake. Given the publisher's big portfolio, it's really hard to even figure out what it could be. Granted, it's not any one of their sports franchises since remaking an annual sports game wouldn't really make any sense.\n\nThat leaves mostly X-COM, Mafia, Civilization, Borderlands, and BioShock. However, Mafia already got a remake for the first game and a remaster of the second game. BioShock also received remasters as part of the trilogy collection. Perhaps Gearbox's next Borderlands game (which had been rumored to be unveiled at Summer Game Fest 2024 but wasn't there after all) is actually a remake of the first one? That one got a remaster, too.\n\nWhatever the case, it's something else to look forward to from 2K Games. We'll keep you apprised on any further rumors and leaks on the project.",

      "# [2K Games Has Officially Ditched Its PC Launcher by Zack Zwiezen on 2024-11-26](https://kotaku.com/2k-games-pc-launcher-sunset-removed-borderlands-mafia-1851708407)\nBorderlands and Civilization publisher 2K Games has quietly done something very cool and good: The company has removed the need to use its 2K PC launcher from all of its games, and sunset the software completely.\n\nFor many, many years, Steam—Valve’s digital PC store—was the de facto launcher and marketplace for all computer games. But starting around 2019 or so, publishers like EA, 2K, Ubisoft, and Bethesda, all began locking games behind individual (and annoying) launchers. So you’d buy a game on Steam, only to be forced to download and muck around with a separate launcher for that game that would boot up each time you tried to play it via Steam. Some companies just stopped publishing games on Steam completely in an effort to avoid paying Valve a cut of each sale. But more publishers are finally reversing course on all this nonsense, and 2K Games is the latest.\n\nOn November 18, 2K Games quietly began sunsetting its PC games launcher and removing it entirely from all of its titles.\n\nWith this change, Bioshock Remastered, Bioshock 2 Remastered, Bioshock Infinite, The Quarry, and Marvel’s Midnight Suns will now all launch directly into the game via Steam with no bullshit steps in between. No more updating a launcher or linking accounts or whatever. You hit play on Bioshock in Steam and that’s that.\n\nSome games, like the remastered Mafia Trilogy, will take a bit more work to scrub out the 2K Games launcher. The Borderlands publisher has updated each game’s support page with info on what users will need to do.\n\nAdditionally, on November 25 the publisher pushed out an update on Steam that fully removed the 2K Games launcher, replacing the folder that contained all of its files and data on your PC with a single text file named “2kLauncherRemoved.txt.” The publisher says you can safely delete that file, too.\n\n2K has a separate guide for folks wanting to make sure every last bit and bob of the launcher is fully gone from their PCs.\n\nOh, and for the few of you out there who liked the 2K Games Launcher, well, sorry. The publisher confirmed in a FAQ that it has no plans to continue to support it, but 2K does “appreciate your interest.”"
