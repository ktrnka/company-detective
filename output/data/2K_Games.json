Civilization launched with many innovative features that persist in the series to this day.\n\nAssuming the role of one of history's greatest leaders, chosen from a roster of 15, players guided their chosen civilizations from the dawn of recorded history circa 4000 BC all the way to the year 2100, by which time the game predicted that space voyages to Alpha Centauri will be a reality.Â\n\nBeing the first civilization to assemble a spaceship and complete that journey was one of three ways to achieve victory in the original Civilization. Other options included conquering every city belonging to other civilizations, and scoring the most points before the game ends after a predetermined number of turns or upon reaching the year 2100. Multiple paths to victory remain a defining part of what it means to be a Civilization game to this day.\n\nRegardless of which victory type players pursued, every crucial economic, political, and military decision was theirs alone to make.

      "# [Want To Know More About The Quarry Horror Game?](https://quarrygame.2k.com/faq/)\nA: The Quarry is an all-new teen-horror narrative game, where every decision shapes your unique story from a tangled web of possibilities. Any character can be the star of the show - or die - before daylight comes. Take control of nine camp counselors and, using your wits in conversation and reflexes during action, do everything you can to steer them away fromâor directly intoâdanger.\n\nA: Yes! The Quarry offers multiple ways for you to experience the fright with friends. You can play the game solo, or with up to seven other companions in local couch co-op with each player controlling a counselor's actions. In addition, The Quarry features an exciting online mode where you and your friends can watch along and vote on key decisions, creating a story shaped by the whole group!\n\nConsole players: Note that online multiplayer is only supported across the same PlayStation/Xbox generations (PS4 to PS4, PS5 to PS5, Xbox One to Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S to Xbox Series X|S). If you buy the Deluxe Edition you'll have access to both previous- and new-generation versions of the game (within the same console family) and can choose which one to launch in order to play with friends.\n\nA: Death Rewind is a retry mechanic that normally unlocks after your first completion of The Quarry. Start the story with three opportunities to reverse a playable character's death, giving you a chance to alter fate and save them in the process. But with only three retries per playthrough, you'll have to decide when someone's life is truly worth saving, and the undoing of one horrible end may lead to another. Choose wisely.\n\nA: Yes. If you own a digital version of The Quarry for PlayStation 4 or Xbox One you can purchase the Digital Upgrade to provide access to the new-gen version within the same console family and entitled to the same Xbox network or PlayStation Network account.\n\nIf you own a physical version of The Quarry for PlayStation 4 you have the option to purchase the PS5 Digital Upgrade if you own a PlayStation 5 with a disc drive. The PlayStation 4 The Quarry disc must be inserted into the PlayStation 5 whenever playing the new-gen digital version of the game.\n\nA: Our goal with Streamer Mode was to provide a simple and streamlined way for players to create content for The Quarry that included music. Due to evolving standards and practices with how licensed music is implemented and tracked across games and content, this wasnât the case at launch and we decided to switch the name to \"Alternate Music\" to better set expectations for our streaming community. We also recommend adding âThe Quarryâ in their video/streaming headline to help avoid any issues.",

      "# Post ID 1bn2yzr: Major differences between 1k and 2k games? with +3 score by [(Squallvash, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/)\nBesides an extra 1k points. Hurr hurr.\n\nMy group is mostly interested in 1k games. Quick games that won't take too long for our newbie selves.\n\nSo there are tons of resources on how to play 2k games. How many units you should take. What types of units to fill your army with. How to transport them. When to charge. How you should move across the board. What's best for armies at 2k. Which is fair, it feels like 2k is how 40k was intended to be played.\n\nMy question is are there any resources that can talk about how a 1k game differs? Or failing that, does anyone have any information they've picked up in playing their own games?\n\nThe armies feel as though they have to be wuite different. Some of the best units in some armies are simply too expensive to use in a 1k list. Or you can't take as many units that help them.\n\nHow do you take a good balance of unit types? How do you control the board with less units? How do you take objectives and hold while having to simultaneously take others with fewer units? How does limiting games to 1k change some of the better or worse armies in the game?\n\nThanks very much for any insight you might be able to offer.\n\n\n## Comment ID kwfnbfr with +14 score by [(SaiBowen, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwfnbfr/) (in reply to ID 1bn2yzr):\n1k games sacrifice a lot of balance to be only nominally shorter, imo.\n\nDon't get me wrong, some playstyles jump up playtime dramatically from 1k to 2k, but if you know the rules and you know your army I would guess adding that second 1000points probably comes to less than an hour extra of playtime for the average game.\n\nI recently pushed my group from 1k to 2k and games take 30-40 minutes longer but are way more fun and feel a lot more balanced overall.\n\n### Comment ID kwfqiao with +5 score by [(hypershrew, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwfqiao/) (in reply to ID kwfnbfr):\nYep, people just tend to field more infantry in 1k games and leave the monsters/vehicles at home.\n\n#### Comment ID kwh7y35 with +5 score by [(Squallvash, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwh7y35/) (in reply to ID kwfqiao):\nYou'd think that, but my brother built an all monsters Nids list that was just too hard to deal with overall. \n\nNot really a \"that guy\" move because he was just playing the models he found interesting. \n\nHe's currently playing a list of all Scions and 1 Valkyrie. It's just because he thinks it's fun.

I have to look at stratagems!\" Or we'll have to stop and look up a rule or I want to measure everything to make sure I can make a charge.\n\nOr we simply blunder. \n\nWe figure if we have to do a 2k game 2x the points means 2x the time, but I don't really think that'll be the case.\n\n#### Comment ID kwh9lvj with +5 score by [(SaiBowen, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwh9lvj/) (in reply to ID kwh6xu6):\nYeah, see that is exactly what I mean.  1k games aren't taking you 4 hours because the game takes that long, they are taking that long because you are unfamiliar with the rules and your army.\n\n**That is totally okay!**  I would say focus on overcoming that first, once you can get your 1k game down to like 2-2.5 hours, I would look at moving to 2k if that is your goal.  Even playing against people with general knowledge, I regularly find it is extremely rare for 2k to take us past the 3.5 hour mark.\n\n## Comment ID kwfn7h5 with +6 score by [(Casandora, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwfn7h5/) (in reply to ID 1bn2yzr):\nOne difference is that sticky objectives (such as Cadian Shock Troops has) and defensive stratagems increase in value in 1k battles. It is also typically worth leaning more into smaller units for more flexibility. And tiny action monkey units, such as Cyclops Demolition Vehicles and Sororitas Crusader, can be even more valuable. \n\nCheck out the YouTuber Christian von Carmian. He makes some great strategy videos around playing 1k battles!\n\n### Comment ID kwh80dk with +3 score by [(Squallvash, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwh80dk/) (in reply to ID kwfn7h5):\nI'm going to look into this for info.

Several armies perform really well at lower points where as some just dont have enough to really make an impact.  \n\nFor instance knights should be banned as you arent going to be able to take enough to really do much against them.  I would look to have 300 points of scoring units, 300 of anti-infantry and 300 of anti tank. lists should probably also contain the entire contents of a combat patrol with exception of the characters or considerations made for combat patrols like deathguard and thousand sons.  \n\nEscalation style games are really worth doing where you start with even less points and work your way up to 2k, with jumps of 500 points every few weeks to a month.

In smaller point games, people tend to be reluctant to bring the more expensive units like monsters or vehicles. Even elites like terminators are less common at that point range, as they’d take up around 20% of your army for just 5 minis. \n\nIn theory, 1k is quicker to play than 2k, but often in practise the difference is negligible. \n\nHowever, it’s up to you and your opponent and what you want to play - if you prefer lots of infantry, then perhaps 1k games will be quicker and more fun for you!\n\n## Comment ID kwgoxgq with +3 score by [(Any_Recognition_3068, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwgoxgq/) (in reply to ID 1bn2yzr):\n1K on the smaller board (30x44”) easily becomes ‘bring your buddies to the center and let’s duke it out”. \n\n1K on the larger board (44x60”) is more interesting to me.\n\n### Comment ID kwgqw9q with +5 score by [(Capital_Tone9386, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwgqw9q/) (in reply to ID kwgoxgq):\nYou'll then be happy to know that the core rules themselves state that 1k games have to be played on a minimum size of 44x60 (the mission packs state the minimal battlefield size for each army size)\n\n#### Comment ID kwgrxuh with +3 score by [(Any_Recognition_3068, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwgrxuh/) (in reply to ID kwgqw9q):\nAh, I was under the impression that it was the smaller board.\n\nWas it different in 9th?\n\n## Comment ID kwj01nt with +3 score by [(Consistent-Brother12, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwj01nt/) (in reply to ID 1bn2yzr):\nThe big difference I've found between 1k and 2k games is that because resource management is such a big aspect of the game, losing a unit makes a much bigger impact and decisions have to be made a bit more carefully.

I think if sub 2k it's critical to find a nice rule 0 set to play with so that no one is overpowering the board really... honestly I've given it some thought and 1k games are fine with people that are more wanting a balanced game but 2k is the goto especially with new people or playing the game at a balanced point. Honestly when I want super quick small games I just play combat patrols, it isn't exactly the same but games duke out quick.\n\n### Comment ID kwiw917 with +1 score by [(Squallvash, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwiw917/) (in reply to ID kwiff8f):\nI may have to try Combat Patrol.

After login at [https://accounts.2k.com/](https://accounts.2k.com/en-US), if you visit [https://accounts.2k.com/v2/me](https://accounts.2k.com/v2/me) it should show you what platforms have been connected to your 2k account. This is their API. I saw that I have 5 platforms connected and Game Center is among them. \n\nFrom their account page, I could see other platforms except for game center. Other platforms can be unlinked by visiting the unlink endpoints like [https://accounts.2k.com/auth/nintendo/unlink](https://accounts.2k.com/auth/nintendo/unlink). But it didn't work for gamecenter. [https://accounts.2k.com/auth/gamecenter/unlink](https://accounts.2k.com/auth/gamecenter/unlink) redirects me to a 404 page.\n\nI will continue trying to contact Aspyr support. It's so bad that they have a bug and don't respond to support requests.\n\n### Comment ID f1e6lrk with +6 score by [(crackofdawn, Reddit, 2019-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/ch8qpi/impossible_to_login_to_2k_account_on_civ_6_ios/f1e6lrk/) (in reply to ID f1dn568):\nThey actually closed my ticket yesterday, the one from when I first opened this thread, first they emailed me a month or so ago asking whether i still wanted the ticket to remain open and since nothing had been done yet at all i replied yes, and then yesterday they said they were switching to a new ticketing system and closing all existing tickets.\n\nSuch bullshit.\n\n#### Comment ID f1h5mqu with +3 score by [(aifreedom, Reddit, 2019-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/ch8qpi/impossible_to_login_to_2k_account_on_civ_6_ios/f1h5mqu/) (in reply to ID f1e6lrk):\nIt happened to me too.

I stopped caring for a while but tried to get it working again. In the past I contacted 2K and Aspyr but only got tips from them. I just got it working again but there was a lot of trial and error as I also used Steam to play as well. Here is a list of things to try (most are listed in the thread in one way or another):\n\n1. Disconnect 2K from all other accounts, steam, epic, google (this is accessible on 2K's site)\n2. Log out of 2K in all Civ VI games (whether steam, switch, PS, Xbox, etc)\n3. Restore purchases (on ios: \"Get More Content\" -> \"Restore Purchases\")\n4. Logging out of your Apple ID (go the \"Settings\" app, click your apple ID name in the top, under \"iCloud\", \"Media & Purchases\", \"Find My\", etc, there should be a \"Sign Out\" option)\n\nNote: Every time you change something, reset the app (not just exiting out, in the Home screen, swiping up and pausing so you see what apps are open and swipe civ vi away). Yes its tedious but changes won't go into affect until you do that (they also say wait 15 min but I'm impatient)\n\nOption 4 is what worked for me most recently. For that though, I logged out, opened Civ and the option to login to 2K was available (the logo turned Red from Grey previously) but you need iCloud in order to connect 2K. So with Civ still open in the background, I logged back in and did not allow my iCloud to merge. Then I reset the app and it was working. I know the iCloud merge is probably not possible for everyone but it was what worked. \n\nIt seems like in order to make this work, you need your ios game to believe this is your only civ/2k account. It's stupid and you would think after years it would be fixed but alas. May your achievements not be deleted and your clouds connect.\n\n## Comment ID ev0wciq with +1 score by [(Nickjrock, Reddit, 2019-07-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/ch8qpi/impossible_to_login_to_2k_account_on_civ_6_ios/ev0wciq/) (in reply to ID ch8qpi):\nSame here\n\n### Comment ID ev0wpiq with +1 score by [(crackofdawn, Reddit, 2019-07-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/ch8qpi/impossible_to_login_to_2k_account_on_civ_6_ios/ev0wpiq/) (in reply to ID ev0wciq):\nI've tried everything.

I was just looking for cloud saves. Found no answers online and the FAQs don't even mention a disabled state for the 2k button.\n\n*Preface:* *I downloaded Civ6 from the respective Apple App Stores (iOS, iPadOS, MacOS). Solution may differ if from Epic or Steam.* \n\n**Game Center:**\n\nFirst and foremost, the connection to Civ6 servers requires Game Center. Without it, you're offline. You need to have GameCenter enabled on your device. When you launch the app, if you see a Game Center notification that you're signed in, then you know you're good here. \n\n**Log In and Link Accounts:**\n\n*(I honestly don't understand the mechanics of this one, or if it's even necessary in addition to Game Center, but I took an overkill approach)* \n\nOn both the native browser (Safari) and the default browser (Chrome for me), sign into your 2k Account. If you haven't already, link your 2k Account anywhere you can (I linked Steam, Epic, and Google). \n\n**Close, Relaunch, Verify:**\n\nThird: Make sure you're logged into all of those linked accounts on your browser(s) (2K, Epic, Steam, Gmail for me). Close / Quit Civ6 completely. Re-launch it. Verify Game Center sign-in message appears. 2k account button (bottom right) should work now. \n\nIf this doesn't work for you, let me know the situation (device, download platform, etc.) and I can offer some troubleshooting advice. \n\n*Thoughts*\n\n*This game was released in 2016, so I will accept that you need to jump through invisible hoops to get this to work if it doesn't work the first time. However, I will not have sympathy for a shotty implementation in Civ7.*",
      "# Post ID 1eieskr: Imagine Microsoft Acquiring 2K Games with +0 score by [(Jaronwheeler, Reddit, 2024-08-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1eieskr/imagine_microsoft_acquiring_2k_games/)\nHey everyone,\n\n\n\nI’ve been thinking about the potential benefits if Microsoft were to acquire 2K Games and bring them into the Xbox family. It’s an exciting idea with lots of potential, and I wanted to share my thoughts and see what you all think!\n\n\n\n1. Expanded Game Library for Xbox: With 2K Games under Microsoft's wing, Xbox would gain access to some incredible franchises like \\*NBA 2K, Borderlands, and XCOM. This could significantly boost the value of Game Pass and provide Xbox players with a broader selection of high-quality games.\n\n\n\n2. Enhanced Cross-Platform Experiences: Integrating 2K’s games with Xbox’s ecosystem could lead to enhanced cross-platform play and exclusive content. Imagine exclusive events or features tied to Xbox that would further enrich the gaming experience.\n\n\n\n3. Revitalizing Classic Titles: One exciting possibility is remaking classic games, and I think a reimagining of \\*The Darkness\\* would be awe inspiring. Picture this: The Darkness completely rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 with an upgraded story and expanded darkness powers. The potential for a modern take on this game could be incredible, offering both nostalgic fans and new players a fresh experience.\n\n\n\n4. Strengthened Xbox Game Studios: Acquiring 2K could bolster Microsoft’s game development capabilities and lead to new collaborations and innovations within the Xbox ecosystem.\n\n\n\nWhat do you all think? Would acquiring 2K Games be a game-changer for Xbox?

Studios like Double Fine got to un-cut cut content in psychonauts 2 and have had plenty of time to work on their next project without worrying about funds.

It doesn't even make sense as the games won't be exclusive, they would still put them on PlayStation etc, so it would just be to put the games on Gamepass, but Gamepass day 1s may not even last for that long, or they price people out of Gamepass ultimate.\n\nActivision has all the things that you listed, yet I don't think Xbox will really look to remake old games, unless someone asks to, which is unlikely.\n\nIf you own all the studios under Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda, and Activision and still can't produce quality games there is an issue within Xbox, Xbox doesn't need to be bigger\n\n## Comment ID lg68240 with +3 score by [(Plutuserix, Reddit, 2024-08-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1eieskr/imagine_microsoft_acquiring_2k_games/lg68240/) (in reply to ID 1eieskr):\nNo, thanks.

I have enough Microtransactions in my Xbox games, thank you very much. \n\nThere's only two companies I can make sense of Microsoft buying anyone for entertainment growth. 1, would be WB and I wouldn't be totally against that because they're already dying under Discovery (even though they're supposed to be equal). WB would give them only a bit more as a gaming company (WB Games) but would largely be a new venture into media entertainment outside of gaming with comics, movies/TV, etc. I'm the modern age it'd help them compete with the likes of Amazon and Apple doing the same and at this rate Microsoft wouldn't much be able to starting their own tv/movie production studios (though that'd also be interesting). Worst case scenario they kill off WB sooner which rips the bandaid off. And then maybe an eastern publisher which might be more like ​inevitable if they want to continue growing. There's so much conflicting rumors around why Tango might have been closed, but one suggestion is that they are too far from the rest of the studios across Microsoft Gaming making collaboration as a smaller AA studio difficult. Microsoft is going to need a strong presence in the east to actually grow there and that'd mean at the very least heavily partnering more with eastern gaming companies (which granted we see right now so that might be the route they take). \n\nSomething to keep in mind is that Microsoft didn't approach ABK. As far as I know they didn't approach Zenimax either. I don't think either sides of the argument on gamers end (consolidation being good or bad) really recognize what it represents. It's a sign of the industry shrinking. When that happens companies either downsize themselves, cease entirely, or get gobbled up (which will lead to some natural downsizing on top of the inevitable bit), which is what we saw with ABK and Zenimax. The executives there just didn't see any more growth in gaming on their own for their companies and instead they saw rather turmultous times (which we are in). Selling to Microsoft was them cashing out. They thought they made as much as they could and were done. People get angry at the idea a business always has to grow, but I mean it does. If it's not growing then eventually it will start losing money so those businesses that think they've peaked find some way to cash out (much like you would if you think a stock has grown as much as it will or if you're satisfied with its growth). Microsoft on the other hand saw opportunity when approached by those companies (or saw opportunity in approaching them). They too recognized the industry is in a downturn but thought they could make the most of it (which they did; I mean at a time where growth in the console market is flat and Xbox being third place sees slight overall decline, they skyrocketed growth). \n\nThere's various moral and post economic factors about how everyone as an individual might view consolidation, but it's important to keep in mind on the business end why it happens in the first place. Microsoft doesn't actually stand to benefit business wise buy purchasing everyone under the sun. It costs money to acquire a company and then they foot the bill for literally everything to do with that company after AND have to go through massive lengthy restructures (Zenimax still isn't done). A lot of benefits they'd get from purchasing they can get through deals and partnerships at less money with less risk. Companies themselves also might not see any real reason to try to be acquired or want it if offered. 2k Games is a subsidiary of Take Two and Take Two still has SO much room to grow and a long time before they're losing money consistently even in the current landscape. \n\nAt this point Microsoft wouldn't even benefit much themselves buying any other gaming publishers. Again I could see one to propel them into other mediums of entertainment especially as video game content IP rises in popularity or one to expand globally, but like jut 2k games or take two? None of what you said requires spending billions and paying overhead for either? Take Two can take advantage of Xbox Play Anywhere at any time. Take two also (unlike ABK ever did) supports Game Pass pretty okay and don't do many exclusives (unlike Bethesda had begun to with PS). There's no guarantee or bringing up old titles and again that doesn't require an acquisition. I don't think anyone would want that on the business or consumer end\n\n### Comment ID lgpxu1f with +1 score by [(Jaronwheeler, Reddit, 2024-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1eieskr/imagine_microsoft_acquiring_2k_games/lgpxu1f/) (in reply to ID lgke4oz):\nThe idea of Microsoft buying WB for movies and TV is cool, but I think they should focus on games first. 2K Games could really help make Xbox better with all the popular titles they have.

Base game Civ games are often quite rough and have features from the previous game stripped away, only to be added in the next dlc. Base game Civ 6 is *far* worse than fully complete Civ 5 and I doubt you will find many who disagree with me.

Its not people randomly hating. The new numbered edition is always legitimately a worse game than the previous one, on release. They're always extremely poorly optimized as well.\n\nEvery single release of Civ releases half-baked, buggy, and without half of the features the previous edition had.\n\nThey then replace some of those missing features with the first expansion, and then finish most of the rest with the last expansion, finally making Civ N a more complete game with more features than Civ N-1 had. Tack on some pseudo-countries and pseudo-leaders, and you've got the most complete version of the game, Civ N.\n\nThen years later, they release Civ N+1, which is the same as Civ N but with some core mechanic changed and half of the features missing.\n\n\nThis is the only way the business model works, since there just aren't that many new things to tack on to justify a full N+1th new version of the game. But there are still some features in Civ 4 that are absent from Civ 6, namely sufficient modding support, vassalization, and corporations.\n\nI didn't play 6 much because the scenarios were garbage in comparison to 5. But the ability to overhaul the game into a completely different form has been gone since 4, and I don't expect it to return.\n\n#### Comment ID l7l8rg6 with +1 score by [(Mr-Mister, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1da95r5/civilization_vii_banner_appears_on_2k_games/l7l8rg6/) (in reply to ID l7iudh3):\nYou're forgetting how a few years after the game's release an update introduces a bug where if the game has more that a certain numbers of entities (not just loaded at once, but, in layman's terms, in its database) then it crashes, and that greatly limits the number of mods you can use concurrenrtly.\n\n#### Comment ID l7j486p with +2 score by [(PacoTaco321, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1da95r5/civilization_vii_banner_appears_on_2k_games/l7j486p/) (in reply to ID l7iudh3):\nIf it doesn't look like a mobile game, then it's fine.\n\n### Comment ID l7iqxnt with +8 score by [(cslack30, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1da95r5/civilization_vii_banner_appears_on_2k_games/l7iqxnt/) (in reply to ID l7io8lz):\nHaven’t a lot of devs left firaxis recently?

Part of the fun is learning the patterns of the AI and successfully predicting them, and when computers don't act like computers, the only psychologically safe assumption is that they must have accessed information they shouldn't have. AI isn't allowed to gamble, or behave randomly, or get lucky-even though humans do all of these things on a daily basis- not because we can't program it, but because experience tells us that players will get frustrated and quit, The same phenomenon doesn't happen when both opponents are humans, because they've already tempered their expectations for the possibility that the other guy is crazy. computers are too smart to be crazy, so if they start acting that way, we can't shake the suspicion that they know something we don't.

If the AI plays to win, then the roleplayers get mad that the AI does things like declare war even though you were friends for the last 150 turns. If the AI caters to roleplayers, then the AI becomes more exploitable and it won't make the best choice if it breaks the illusion.\n\nIt's not really possible to cater fully to both sides. Civ 6 probably leans more to the roleplay side, with things like agendas.\n\n#### Comment ID l7lnktd with +1 score by [(Munno22, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1da95r5/civilization_vii_banner_appears_on_2k_games/l7lnktd/) (in reply to ID l7jlt4t):\n> I am a huge 4X fan and I don’t think I have ever played one where the AI felt genuinely intelligent\n\nI was really impressed with the Humankind AI tbh even if the rest of the game wasn't perfect.\n\n#### Comment ID l7k46s7 with +1 score by [(This_Guy_Fuggs, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1da95r5/civilization_vii_banner_appears_on_2k_games/l7k46s7/) (in reply to ID l7jlt4t):\ni mean... no.\n\na shit ai, of course, but a good ai would absolutely stomp humans.\n\nand with the abundance of alleged ai these days, seems that it shouldnt be that insane of an ask to get good ai in a turn based game with very clear and detailed variables.\n\n#### Comment ID l7juolf with +1 score by [(GepardenK, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1da95r5/civilization_vii_banner_appears_on_2k_games/l7juolf/) (in reply to ID l7jlt4t):\nThey say the same thing about RTSs, but AoE2:DE invested hard in an AI that could play the economy game properly, and the difference is like night and day. \n\nThe game benefits so much from an AI that, for most of the playerbase, can lead by example - and comparing it to other RTSs the gap is shocking.

They made each city unique, made the player require more planning and I loved that there was a tradeoff between building a district and having in improved tile.\n\nWhat took me a while to get accustomed to were wonders on tiles.

In 6 however they basically axed this because of how strong district adjacency bonuses are, meaning you had to build way more cities so that your districts could stack insane bonuses by being next to each other or places of interest on the map. I actually enjoyed the mini game of fitting your districts together like a puzzle in the most efficient manner possible, but a return to form where it is viable to build tall if you want would be awesome.\n\n### Comment ID l7j1e4d with +3 score by [(Remon_Kewl, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1da95r5/civilization_vii_banner_appears_on_2k_games/l7j1e4d/) (in reply to ID l7irgsa):\nThose games were considered complex for their time, they were as complex as they could be, depending on the capabilities of the machines of their time.\n\nEDIT: Also, if simpler 4x are more appealing why isn't Ozymandias, e.g., more popular?\n\n#### Comment ID l7j8f80 with +1 score by [(Chataboutgames, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1da95r5/civilization_vii_banner_appears_on_2k_games/l7j8f80/) (in reply to ID l7j1e4d):\nIsn't Ozymandias a city builder?\n\n### Comment ID l7ishku with +23 score by [(dergadoodle, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1da95r5/civilization_vii_banner_appears_on_2k_games/l7ishku/) (in reply to ID l7irgsa):\nI do think the biggest goal for Firaxis this go around is to bring some flavor back to the game.\n\nThe district system in Civ 6 made matches more game-y and mechanically engaging. Unfortunately, in my opinion, it also made the matches extremely same-y even between totally different leaders. \n\nThe lighter touch mechanics of Civ 5 made for more engaging self-made stories than the mechanically strong Civ 6.

Progressing your MyPlayer is horrible because it takes forever and the VC(currency to upgrade your player which can also be bought with money) greed is out of control. So there is a good chance 2K would push this MyPlayer concept with all the VC bs in a fifa game too. So players who are interested in a MyPlayer fifa version are doomed and will probably have a horrible experience. So that is where all the hate is coming from and rightfully so.\n\nWith that being said, outside of that the NBA 2K games are very very good in my opinion. People who are playing the Franchise Mode (MyNBA Mode) to have a realistic and immersive  Basketball experience and taking advantage of the huge amount of the customization the game allows to create your own nba universe or replay through past eras  usually enjoy the game very much. Also the Player Lock setting lets you have a infinitely better version of MyCareer, most people just dont know about it and therefore never gave it a try. You wont even get many opinions on the offline modes because 2K somehow managed to make the majority of people only care about the shitty online VC modes and ignoring the fantastic offline Franchise modes the game has to offer.\n\nSo while 2K is very capable of creating an amazing manager Mode im not sure they can do the same with fifa. The nba is much much smaller in scale when it comes to the amount of stadiums, teams, League, Player database, historic players etc than football.\n\n### Comment ID l786xff with +1 score by [(SnooCookies4806, Reddit, 2024-06-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FifaCareers/comments/1d8n5pr/what_does_a_potential_2k_game_mean_for_us_career/l786xff/) (in reply to ID l77lq3h):\nGreat points!

This caused EA to actually put some effort into the series once again resulting in FIFA ultimately overtaking PES around 2010s and driving it to the ground. And it's been downward spiral for FIFA ever since Konami switched to eFootball or whatever that mess is. Having a new player on the market hopefully is going to bring back the same level of competition. It's always better to have two games that are consistently competing with each other over the same market then one mediocre monopolist.",

I can only play at my local store and that is the set level there whether 40k or AoS.  These games tend to happen fortnightly depending how busy the place is and last an hour or so.\n\nI play Custodes - and have done since they launched - is … ‘interesting‘ given all the changes.  Since 10th dropped, even before the ”balance dataslate”, 750 was a struggle to build a list. All this “baked-in” wargear is meaningless when units don’t have options anyway.  Claims that ‘the game is balanced at 1k’ sounds hollow when games aren’t played at that level. To vary between 1.5 and 2k would mean two of the dreadnoughts and/or a squad or two.\n\nThe only bigger game I have had recently was a Heresy match, that was 4k and that took several hours.\n\n## Comment ID k1o5zo6 with +3 score by [(Logical-Sprinkles273, Reddit, 2023-09-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/16or6p8/does_anyone_ever_play_less_than_2k_games/k1o5zo6/) (in reply to ID 16or6p8):\nOnly play 1k.

Big enough to bring some fun models, but time conscious. We're also solidly in the beerhammer category though so games typically take longer than they should, lol. We're all pretty veteran players with plenty of models, we just found 1.5k to be the most fun in 9th in time and pacing. Not sure how 10th will shake out.

The feel of some armies at 1k vs 2k is drastically different, especially because you're less likely to see as many vehicles, high damage weaponry or high amounts of infantry as compared to something like a 2k game.

Do not expect anything from 2k that you haven’t gotten from EAFC. \n\nThere’s a few different things that 2k does but it makes the game just as miserable. \n\n1. There’s always, of course, full meta, for example heighth which is just as important as pace in EAFC\n\n2. You thought pack odds in EAFC are bad? lol, wait until you get <1% on every pack for super rare cards, they don’t even tell you the odds, one guy spent about $2.5k to get a rare card from the drop, live on stream. Packs cost just as much if not more.\n\n3. Gameplay is consistant. _That doesn’t mean it’s good_, but it is consistant, you learn which animations are going to happen (at least with their engine), randomness factor still exists (but not as much as there is in eafc).\n\n4. It’s barely playable on PC. 2k on PC is full of cheaters, using algorhytms etc. to green time their shots, modding their players to be 5m tall etc. so I hope that FIFA takes care of the PC side of the game.\n\n5. They don’t do menu grinding and SBCs but I reckon FIFA is going to implement that, they have a Card Collection sort of thing where you get rewards based on how many items have you collected (for example you get Icon Zico for 1k players collected etc.)\n\n6. 2k has an ‘amazing’ MyCareer mod though, much better than you’ve seen in EAFC, including co-op with other people and parks, since the most of the player base is playing that game mode and not the MyTeam (FUT).\n\n7.

I've done RTTs with 3 hour rounds that include set up. Some tournaments do 2:30 rounds. It requires both players to be very efficient with decisions and to know their rules very well. Very little looking rules or stats up. Having all your tools readily available. Thinking about what you're going to do while your opponent goes so you immediately start taking actions on your turn. It's a much more sterile way of playing, but still fun if you're into that.\n\nI think the biggest thing you can do to speed up is knowing the vast majority of your rules and stats by heart so as to not waste time by looking things up.\n\n### Comment ID l6xdto9 with +38 score by [(ducksbyob, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6xdto9/) (in reply to ID l6x5l8m):\nYeah, you are probably hitting the mail on the head there.

Serious question.  What do you find is the biggest timesink?  I've never heard of games lasting 8+ hours, even games between new players who don't know all the rules.\n\nMy early games were probably 3-5 hours depending on how quickly I got destroyed.  My casual games now are more in the 2-3 hour range.\n\nFor tournament games, I speed up the process by thinking a lot of things through before I even arrive, having a checklist written out, not talking as much as usual (in casual games I usually think out loud when it comes to my decision processes, give my opponent tips if they're struggling to decide what to do, just generally converse, etc.). \n\nAnd lastly, skip things that won't be impactful.  When shooting a Redemptor, open with the big guns to see if the target dies just from that.  Usually skip the storm bolters unless 1 wound could make all the difference.  Or if a unit of 20 Boyz charges 2 scouts, I just pick up my scouts.  Not worth the time to roll it out when the outcome is 99% determined.\n\nThose kinds of things can get a game down to 90-120 minutes (as long as your opponent is moving equally efficiently).  Chess clocks are kind of necessary to ensure neither player hogs all the time.\n\n### Comment ID l6y6mxh with +3 score by [(the-strange-ninja, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6y6mxh/) (in reply to ID l6x5l8m):\nAdding onto this, skipping some shooting if you know they won’t do much is helpful as well. I had 2 units of legionaries trying to take out a wave serpent on an objective yesterday. Skipped all of the pistol shots and just charged it. Killed it and saved quite a few mins on those shooting rolls.\n\nThat is also to say, efficient decision making include target selection. If you know which of your guns are worth shooting into different units, not only will it save you time on wasted rounds of shooting, but it will also kill your opponent faster.\n\n### Comment ID l6yhb9q with +2 score by [(tiptopjank, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6yhb9q/) (in reply to ID l6x5l8m):\nDoes it significantly quicken the game to play 1k or 1500?\n\n#### Comment ID l6yjbpx with +3 score by [(blacknight302, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6yjbpx/) (in reply to ID l6yhb9q):\nYup!

With chess clocks you have 1:15 to do all your stuff in a game (including saves during your opponent's turn).\n\n\nHonestly, start with smaller games if it's taking 7 hours at 2000 points. I'm assuming that's a lot of time looking up rules and strategems not even including the extra breaks needed for playing that long.\n\nPlay a game at 500 points. Remember to play on a smaller table at this level and use the core of your 2000 point list so you can get familiar with their rules and strategems that effect them. Really, play a few games with no strategems including rerolls and see how that goes. Then bring them back, then move up to 750, 1000ish,  1500ish,  and then 2000 until your casual games are coming in about 4 hours or so. Play these games with simple deployment, no secondary missions, and generous line of sight blocking.  Add  those in as you progress \n\nLook up \"Fast Rolling\" if you're not already batching up dice rolls for units with the same weapons. Get a box of 36 dice and put piles of 5 dice in front of you to make counting out large amounts of dice easier. Use a dice tray/box to keep dice together.\n\nGet some \"red sticks\" or a gaming ruler  for measuring common distances.  Work on recognizing when you just need to measure what matters (a model has 12\" movement but you're only moving it 6\", a gun can fire 24\" but it's target is obviously closer).\n\n## Comment ID l6xlf9s with +20 score by [(t0matit0, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6xlf9s/) (in reply to ID 1d75yqn):\nIdk how people play 2k in under 3hrs, it takes me closer to 4.\n\n### Comment ID l6yfm5q with +7 score by [(Frixinator, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6yfm5q/) (in reply to ID l6xlf9s):\nDo you need to look up datasheets?

It is however allowed to remove units being killed so it breaks coherency, if you want to keep a certain part of the unit alive.\n\n#### Comment ID l6yvqhk with +1 score by [(cyke_out, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6yvqhk/) (in reply to ID l6xl3un):\nWahapedia is your friend for codex' you don't have.\n\n#### Comment ID l7146rp with +1 score by [(corrin_avatan, Reddit, 2024-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l7146rp/) (in reply to ID l6xl3un):\n>The issue is that if my opponent has a codex I don’t own, I can’t help move things along.\n\nWahapedia, 40k app, rewrecruit, 39k.pro are all resources to look up rules when your opponent doesn't have them, which honestly should not be a thing that happens.\n\n## Comment ID l6xw8uh with +4 score by [(Kyrasthrowaway, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6xw8uh/) (in reply to ID 1d75yqn):\nIn a tournament you aren't drinking bourbon or socializing much.

Note that this includes setup, introduction of forces, and deployment.\n\nIn a casual game you're likely horsing around, joking, talking to other friends when they walk into the game store. If you're taking over 7 hours you're also probably breaking for food, getting drinks, that sort of thing. In tournament you're probably giving most of your attention to the game. You might still joke with your opponent, but if you're taking too long most tournaments require the use of chess clocks if a player requests one. Once your time runs out, you can only take required actions like rolling saves.\n\nThe #1 eater of clocks for new and casual players is analysis paralysis. \"Where should this unit move, where do I shoot, should I charge, should I CP reroll that?\". Even if it feels like you're only thinking for a couple of minutes, it's often longer than it feels and that time can compound very quickly. Tournament players will often have their first couple of turns planned out (move these units out to objectives, everything else stages for the next turn), will be quick with target identification (I am playing mostly Infantry so I don't really care about those Lascannon Havoks), and will have a game plan for what strats they're going to use the most over the course of the game. CP Reroll usually doesn't matter. They also use the time in their opponent's turn by planning out their next turns. Even if your gameplan falls apart due to poor saves or something, recovering and adapting will take significantly less time than trying to come up with a plan for each turn from scratch every turn.\n\nSomething else that really helps is playing by intent. You openly announce what you're doing and why, then do not have to precisely measure everything with perfect pinpoint accuracy. For example, there's a trick where you place your unit just outside of 1 inch from a Ruin wall, which will force the opponent (assuming they are on 28mm bases or larger) to go all the way around the wall in order to complete a charge, and can limit what of theirs actually gets into engagement range and therefore what gets to fight. You COULD take 10 minutes measuring every single model to be the actual perfect distance, or you could play by intent and get them close enough, and simply inform your opponent this is what you are doing. It is important to note that you should do this while you are actually moving the unit, and not announcing it in their Charge phase because you realized you didn't do it and ate a charge. It's a tool for more fluid, faster games, not Ctrl+Z for mistakes. Another example for movement, you can say \"I want to move this unit here, but I don't want to be visible to that tank\". As long as you have the movement to do so and your opponent agrees you do, you can just get close enough instead of walking around the table and bending over the tank to triple-check that you won't take an Overwatch.\n\nSome other tips include: \n\n* Knowing your rules and relevant FAQs. I like to keep a cheat sheet on me, and I print up enough for my opponents when I go to an event so they can quickly reference my stats and rules. I also recommend putting bookmarks in your codex, and marking Rules sections you commonly refer to as a Favorite in the app so you can pull it up quickly. Looking things up and figuring out how to deal with an overlapping of rules is most likely the biggest eater of your time outside of analysis paralysis. The Core Rule Book recommends rolling to see who decides what happens if you can't figure it out in a timely manner, and since you're playing casually I would agree with doing that, then looking up the actual interaction/ruling later. The Competitive Warhammer subreddit has a pinned thread specifically for asking rules questions and clarifications. Heck, even in tournament sometimes a judge can get a ruling wrong. 40k is a complicated game.\n\n* Roll faster by keeping up with your opponent. When they announce they're attacking you with 10 chainswords, pick up 10 dice, then discard/add to that handful as they miss/get Sustained Hits. By the time you get to the stage you're rolling your saves, you should have roughly the number you need and can roll more quickly instead of taking that time right then to count out your dice.\n\n* In a related vein, keep your dice in easily counted groups. If your dice are sorted to one side in groups of 4, you can very quickly and easily grab what you need instead of reaching into your dice bag to count them out.\n\n* Do not shoot weapons that don't matter. Your Gants might shave a wound off a Land Raider, but most of the time it will make no difference and you will have suceeded in spending 5 minutes rolling to not change the game state. Similarly, know when to not bother rolling at all. If a unit of BT Bladeguard declares their attacks against a unit of 4 Gants, just remove them. Does this deny a model the chance for a cinematic and heroic last stand? Yes, but the chances of that are extremely remote to begin with, and likely would make no difference to the game anyway.\n\n* I see others advocating for movement trays. Do not use movement trays. The easy way to move large blobs of models is to move the front models, then the back models, and simply fill in the middle. If you have a block of models like I see in your picture, you could even just measure the corner models then fill in the rest.\n\n* Speaking of your picture, I see small wooden(?) markers that I can only assume are the Objectives. I recommend sourcing neoprene Objective markers, which will mark the objective itself and the area around it you have to be in to control it so you don't have to measure 3 inches out to see who controls what. Footprints for your ruins can also help by making it clear what is indide a Ruin and what isn't, and would allow you to move the physical wall out of the way to better measure movement through it.\n\nEDIT: Bullet point formatting borked.\n\n### Comment ID l6ybz1a with +1 score by [(Dawson_VanderBeard, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6ybz1a/) (in reply to ID l6y1j34):\ni'll make the case for super dense movement trays for the horde of models (that are basically a big wound counter) and then use 4-5 models as pickets that represent the edges of the blob. might take a bit more opponent cooperation because of coherency and RAW\n\n#### Comment ID l6yfp61 with +1 score by [(AsherSmasher, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6yfp61/) (in reply to ID l6ybz1a):\nThat will run you into issues if you ever want to do something like moving partially through a wall (how many are on either side), and could cause issues with LoS, coherency, and wargear placement.

I've seen Tau players do that for the index CIB Crisis death brick for example.\n\nThere will also be instances playing a horde army where you just don't activate some things because they aren't worth the time - your army will generally win by standing places, not killing things. As such, you *may* choose not to bother shooting termagants at a stompa or bolters at a land raider depending on the time and game state.\n\nEdit: for what it's worth, when I started playing again a few years ago, 2k took maybe 5/6 hours. 2.45 is a comfortable pace now.\n\n## Comment ID l6z4d8u with +1 score by [(GodzillaMilk69, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6z4d8u/) (in reply to ID 1d75yqn):\nDude bro please get movement trace it’ll make your games go half as fast\n\n### Comment ID l6z9oa2 with +1 score by [(ducksbyob, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6z9oa2/) (in reply to ID l6z4d8u):\nWhat is movement trace,\n\n#### Comment ID l6za016 with +1 score by [(GodzillaMilk69, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6za016/) (in reply to ID l6z9oa2):\nMovement trays, my bad.

It's not that we don't allow rolls like that to be made, it's just in this instance shooting with boys usually doesn't result in a single kill unless I get lucky against most of my buddies armies and the time it takes to do those rolls adds up quick when you have 60ish boys on the table, all to usually end up accomplishing very little/not even killing something. It also helps to not be to big of a stickler for measurements / line of sight at times, especially if you guys are decent at eyeballing it IE if me or my friends are making a move that's shorter then the movement range and we know it we usually just tell the other to not worry about measuring (IE unit is moving the last few inches to objective and they can clearly make it there with movement left over. Stuff you probably would not do at a tournament but we definitely do to speed up the game a bit so it's not dragging on\n\n## Comment ID l6zk6tw with +1 score by [(Baby_ForeverDM, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6zk6tw/) (in reply to ID 1d75yqn):\nI'm a really slow player so it takes be 4-5 hours.

This lets you do 3 rounds in a tournament, and get in an hour lunch for a total of 9 ish hours (10 minutes between rounds). This is often not enough time for everyone to finish their games, however, so the scores end up reflecting that in a lot of cases. You might have a 3 round game with final scores at like 24-30 or something real low like that. The important thing for playing in a tournament, if that's what you're concerned about, is to learn what parts of the game really deserve your attention. Don't worry about taking every possible shot in the first round, just move and line up the important things.\n\n## Comment ID l701h0y with +1 score by [(BrotherCaptainLurker, Reddit, 2024-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l701h0y/) (in reply to ID 1d75yqn):\nAnywhere from 2-5 hours lol.\n\nAt an actual tournament sometimes a successful alpha strike all but decides the game by turn 2 and you call it and grab lunch or run off to some social/family obligation after 90 minutes. Even if it doesn't go that way, if you cut out socialization and robotically declare intent and roll dice you can consistently knock out games in about 3 hours. (Tournament games regularly end at the bottom of turn 3/4 because they start a 2 hour and 50 minute clock the milisecond pairings are posted and then use player placed terrain though :/.) If you're chatting with your real life friend and drinking and discussing how turns could have gone differently, it rapidly becomes an all-night affair to finish a game.\n\nAs for \"why are my games slow,\" when you have a huge amount of models the turns don't scale the same - normally both players have lost so much stuff by the end of turn 3 that turns 4 and 5 go much more quickly as you both take a few calculated risks to grab points and pass, but when you drop 100 dudes on the table, there are still 50 dudes to roll dice for when half your army is gone lol, plus horde units are usually somewhat weak so the other player still has a combat effective army to continue trying to kill you off of objectives with.\n\nThere's also the textbook answer; the game takes twice as long when you have to actually reference your rules. Once you're settled in with your army list of choice you know all the datasheets and relevant stratagems by heart, so you just say what you want to do and what the effect/profile is.\n\n## Comment ID l7023na with +1 score by [(lowqualitylizard, Reddit, 2024-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l7023na/) (in reply to ID 1d75yqn):\nTwo and a half hours\n\nBut those people most likely no their rules the best because they have to.

Last weekend, I managed to finish all 3 of my games under 2 hours, even tho I was the TO :D Friendly and practice games take usually 4 hours.\n\nFrom the tournament standpoint, I did everything to reduce time wasted on logistics or administration. Tables are numbered and easily found. Terrain is already set up and is the same for all 3 games. There is 15 minutes between announcing the pairings and the start of the round, so everyone has time to find their opponent, transport their armies to the table, take a quick smoke/leak/drink or whatever. We also supply trays to make it easier to transport armies.\n\nFrom my years as a player and TO these are my \"findings\" what are the time wasters:\n\n**Administration**: read the mission pack, know what missions you are playing. If possible, read the lists once they are published, to cut down time explaining army lists. Use an app to track your points (set up all the games in advance). Use a dice rolling app if you play hordes. Only have the stuff you need for the army. Like only bring the datasheets you use, leave the rest at home. Use a compact and informative army list. Have a cheat sheet to reference your rules/profiles if you don't know them by heart.  You'd be surprised how much time is wasted by constantly leafing through codexes or those horrendous Army Builder lists (sooo. much. waste. of. paper...)\n\n**Logistics**: Sooner or later you will realize, that you need proper logistical solutions. Which in my experience is some variation of magnetized carry case. Yeah, wrapping stuff in tissues and putting them in boxes might be cheaper, but the constant taking out and putting away, and the space all that stuff takes up wastes time. Also even in proper foam, stuff constantly breaks. Trying to find glue and glueing your minis back together is another time waster. And some people never learn. So have a magnetic carry case and put your miniatures on trays. I even seen people to come to tournaments with those troleys you see in cantinas :D For horde armies, movement trays are recomended.\n\n**Tools/accessories/dice:** This may sound like a no brainer, but you'd be surprised. Have a working and proper tape measure. Laser pointer, Measuring sticks, like 9\" for deep strikes, 3\", etc. Tokens and markers for buffs. *Have. Enough. Dice!* I cannot stress enough that having the right amount and variety of dice is crucial. It's annoying when people roll up to a tournament with 20 dice or even worse and odd number :D Have separate dice for wound markers and command points, so you don't pick them up by mistake. Have at least 2, but 3 different colored dice, so you can roll multiple profiles together and have at least 40 of one of them. If you are not good at recognizing things, use clear dice. No shame in using numbered dice, instead of dots. Also there are a lot of cool looking dice, but when you have to pick out 1s and 2s from a pile of 60 then it get's hard with all the patterns and type of markings. Also use dice trays. Also you may know your own dice, and you are good at recognizing the patterns, but your oppoenent may not and them constantly stopping you to look at your dice is again a time waster.\n\n**Unit markings:** Espacially in horde armies, but even if you spam the same units, it helps if you can easily differentiate which unit is which. \n\n**Know the Core rules:** This may be the most annoying, because 95% of the rules question I receive during a tournament is explaining core rules. How ruins work. How engagement range works. How cover saves work with 3+ saves. Etc. If you know the core rules, 95% of the so called \"rules disputes\" don't arise to begin with.\n\n**Know your own rules** or at least have a cheat sheet at hand. Having to refference the same rules again and again takes time. So either learn your army rules and unit stats or have a clear cheat sheet/reference. Datacards and stratagem cards are quite handy :)\n\n**It's a tournament:** you are there to play and have fun, but it's a tournament. You won't have time to look at other tables, there is no time for small talk and tell stories. If you can multitask, you can talk while you are doing things. If you are not good at multitasking, no one will be mad at you if you focus on your little toy soldiers. Be there physically but also mentally. If you need a smoke break, do that during your opponents movement turn, not when it's your turn. Stand up to your jealous girlfriend who pesters you for constant status updates to leave you some peace. Try not to organize your wedding during a tournament.\n\n**Play by intent:** During movement phase state your intent where you place your models. Like this model is behind the building, you shouldn't be able to see it from this and this angle. This model is touching the objective. This way you can avoid having to double check LoS during alter phases or gotcha moments, where you opponent tries to capitalize on small errors. Of yourse offer the same courtesy to them, so if their intent was to hide that big bug behind a ruin, don't all of a sudden tell them, that you can see them and you are going to shoot them. This again reduces the disputes. But don't let people abuse this.\n\n**Have a game plan:** I know that this game is hard and not everyone is a tactical and strategic genius. But have an idea what you want to do and how to achive it. Don't be reactive, be proactive, meaning, plan your moves during your opponents turn and not when it's your turn. You can check LoS and measure distances anytime, so why not using your opponents turn to do so? It's not 4th edition, where you were not allowed to pre-measure :D\n\nTl/dr.: it's the small things that add up to a lot of wasted time.\n\n## Comment ID l71404r with +1 score by [(corrin_avatan, Reddit, 2024-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l71404r/) (in reply to ID 1d75yqn):\nOP, can you clarify a comment you made, you're saying that the game you had pictured, you played from 3pm to midnight ***and you only ended up finishing the top of the 2nd battle round/the person who got to go first's 2nd turn?***\n\nThere seems to be something absolutely wrong here, as that means on average each turn you guys are doing are long enough that even \"longer\" tournament games of 3 hours are able to fit within them.\n\nAre you guys only playing with 5 total dice?

On most of the tournaments i play, each player gets 1.5 hours which includes deployment. Keep in mind a tournament often plays 3 games back-to-back. Without a timer it would be impossible to run. \n1 hour and 15 minutes per player is also not uncommon. \n\nWith some time set aside for moving things between tables, 3 hours total per game sets you up for a 10-hour day of gaming.\n\nTo manage you need to know your rules, bookmark pages in the codex, plan out your moves while your opponent play and think ahead. With some practice it actually becomes very doable, you just need to actively try to play fast.\n\n### Comment ID l6xeksj with +3 score by [(ducksbyob, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6xeksj/) (in reply to ID l6xdzz2):\nYou chalk the 5 hour game up to just knowing all your rules as well as your opponents?\n\n#### Comment ID l6xjwj0 with +4 score by [(Mor_di, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6xjwj0/) (in reply to ID l6xeksj):\nI could add one more thing that REALLY speeds up a game. Think about when you take stock of the table. Do you each spend maybe 5-10 minutes in your command phases thinking about what to do and where to move? That's at least 1 hour just there. If you plan your moves while your opponent plays. Know where you have shooting lanes, know how you want to move to achieve secondaries. Know the way to objectives, if you're suddenly screened out suring your opponents movement phase, think about how to counter while your opponent plays on. If you're not moving your first units and making decisions within a minute or less from being handed the turn, this is where to really save time.\n\n#### Comment ID l6xfd0j with +2 score by [(Mor_di, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6xfd0j/) (in reply to ID l6xeksj):\nKind of. It does depend on my opponent. I have played the game for a long time so we don't spend very long dealing with rules uncertainties. I have one very new friend and we usually play for close to 6 hours, but a lot of that time is him trying to think and do good choices with limited experience.\n\nWhen i play against other very experienced players a game is less than 4 hours even without the clocks, but that is because we know the rules and our unit stats. Generally if your opponent has some games behind them, you don't need to know their army rules in detail. Just know your own stuff and the basic game rules. There is a lot of downtime to save by just responding quicly to what happens on the table."

I recommend do personal work on the side, no matter how much you may not want to after 40hrs a week at this factory.\r\nThe pay is good if you came from working a day-job at the mall. Just don't compare your salary to other large game companies if you want to stay in blissful ignorance. (but then again, you're not doing much real talent work)\r\nLots of bottle necking due to poor management. \r\nLike most companies, gossip flows like herpes, stay the hell away from the peanut gallery is my advice.",

      "# [2K Games Appears to Be Developing an Unannounced Remake by Alessio Palumbo, www.facebook.com on 2024-07-08](https://wccftech.com/2k-games-appears-to-be-developing-an-unannounced-remake/)\nIt looks like 2K Games is developing an unannounced remake of one of its franchises. As often happens in these cases, the rumor started when MP1st spotted on a LinkedIn resume of a 2K Games 3D artist and Motion Capture Animator the following list of games:\n\nNew Mafia game\n\nNew BioShock game\n\nSupermassive Games project codenamed Erebus (and canceled)\n\nUpcoming Unannounced Remake\n\nWe already knew that Hangar 13 (which recently released Top Spin 2K25) was making a new entry in the Mafia franchise. Studio General Manager Roman Hladík confirmed as much in August 2022, when the series was celebrating its twentieth anniversary:\n\nI'm happy to confirm we've started work on an all-new Mafia project! While it's a few years away and we can't share anything more right now, we're really excited to keep working on this beloved franchise and to entertain our players with new stories.\n\nThe same goes for BioShock, of course. The new installment in the dystopian first-person shooter franchise was announced in late 2019, and yet Cloud Chamber is still ramping up recruitment for the project. The third project is also interesting. Supermassive Games partnered with 2K Games to make The Quarry, which launched in June 2022 to a very positive (9/10) review here on Wccftech. It looks like they were making another game codenamed Erebus; however, it was eventually canceled, which may explain the studio's massive layoffs of a third of its staff a few months ago.\n\nThe news of the day is, however, the unannounced remake. Given the publisher's big portfolio, it's really hard to even figure out what it could be. Granted, it's not any one of their sports franchises since remaking an annual sports game wouldn't really make any sense.\n\nThat leaves mostly X-COM, Mafia, Civilization, Borderlands, and BioShock. However, Mafia already got a remake for the first game and a remaster of the second game. BioShock also received remasters as part of the trilogy collection. Perhaps Gearbox's next Borderlands game (which had been rumored to be unveiled at Summer Game Fest 2024 but wasn't there after all) is actually a remake of the first one? That one got a remaster, too.\n\nWhatever the case, it's something else to look forward to from 2K Games. We'll keep you apprised on any further rumors and leaks on the project.",

      "# [Take Two denies NBA 2K microtransaction theft claim, says virtual currency is a “fiction” by Stephen Totilo on 2024-02-07](https://www.gamefile.news/p/nba-2k-microtransaction-lawsuit-response)\nTake Two and publishing label 2K Games are hitting back at a lawsuit that argues they are stealing from NBA 2K players who buy virtual currency (VC) for those games and then lose it when 2K shuts off the games’ servers.\n\n“VC is not plaintiff’s property,” the company’s lawyers said in a request to dismiss the case that was filed late last week and has not previously been reported.\n\n“Instead, in-game VC are fictions created by game publishers, subject to the publishers’ terms of service and user agreements.”\n\nNBA 2K players buy virtual currency with real money to in turn buy in-game cosmetics and other digital perks in the games.\n\nTake Two and 2K were sued in federal court in California in November by a minor, J.A., who is represented by his mother. They’re not the first to sue over video game microtransactions, but such suits usually involve questions about whether in-game loot-boxes constitute gambling.\n\nJ.A.’s class action claim takes a different approach."

A lawsuit claims that the company is stealing from players who purchase virtual currency (VC) but lose it when servers are shut down. The company has responded by asserting that VC is not the players' property but a fictional currency governed by the terms of service [(Take Two denies NBA 2K microtransaction theft claim, 2024)](https://www.gamefile.news/p/nba-2k-microtransaction-lawsuit-response).\n\n## Partnerships and Collaborations\n\n2K Games has expanded its partnerships, notably with EMPIRE for the NBA 2K25 soundtrack, enhancing the cultural significance of the gaming experience [(NBA 2K25 Season 2, 2024)](https://newsroom-uk.2k.com/news/nbar-2k25-season-2-accept-the-challenge-to-become-the-best-of-the-best-starting-on-october-18).
