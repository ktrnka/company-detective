Civilization launched with many innovative features that persist in the series to this day.\n\nAssuming the role of one of history's greatest leaders, chosen from a roster of 15, players guided their chosen civilizations from the dawn of recorded history circa 4000 BC all the way to the year 2100, by which time the game predicted that space voyages to Alpha Centauri will be a reality.Â\n\nBeing the first civilization to assemble a spaceship and complete that journey was one of three ways to achieve victory in the original Civilization. Other options included conquering every city belonging to other civilizations, and scoring the most points before the game ends after a predetermined number of turns or upon reaching the year 2100. Multiple paths to victory remain a defining part of what it means to be a Civilization game to this day.\n\nRegardless of which victory type players pursued, every crucial economic, political, and military decision was theirs alone to make. Scientific advancements, wonders of the world, military strength, and population growth were just a few of the factors they had to consider while building an empire to stand the test of time.",

      "# [Want To Know More About The Quarry Horror Game?](https://quarrygame.2k.com/faq/)\nA: The Quarry is an all-new teen-horror narrative game, where every decision shapes your unique story from a tangled web of possibilities. Any character can be the star of the show - or die - before daylight comes. Take control of nine camp counselors and, using your wits in conversation and reflexes during action, do everything you can to steer them away fromâor directly intoâdanger.\n\nA: Yes! The Quarry offers multiple ways for you to experience the fright with friends. You can play the game solo, or with up to seven other companions in local couch co-op with each player controlling a counselor's actions. In addition, The Quarry features an exciting online mode where you and your friends can watch along and vote on key decisions, creating a story shaped by the whole group!\n\nConsole players: Note that online multiplayer is only supported across the same PlayStation/Xbox generations (PS4 to PS4, PS5 to PS5, Xbox One to Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S to Xbox Series X|S). If you buy the Deluxe Edition you'll have access to both previous- and new-generation versions of the game (within the same console family) and can choose which one to launch in order to play with friends.\n\nA: Death Rewind is a retry mechanic that normally unlocks after your first completion of The Quarry. Start the story with three opportunities to reverse a playable character's death, giving you a chance to alter fate and save them in the process. But with only three retries per playthrough, you'll have to decide when someone's life is truly worth saving, and the undoing of one horrible end may lead to another. Choose wisely.\n\nA: Yes. If you own a digital version of The Quarry for PlayStation 4 or Xbox One you can purchase the Digital Upgrade to provide access to the new-gen version within the same console family and entitled to the same Xbox network or PlayStation Network account.\n\nIf you own a physical version of The Quarry for PlayStation 4 you have the option to purchase the PS5 Digital Upgrade if you own a PlayStation 5 with a disc drive. The PlayStation 4 The Quarry disc must be inserted into the PlayStation 5 whenever playing the new-gen digital version of the game.\n\nA: Our goal with Streamer Mode was to provide a simple and streamlined way for players to create content for The Quarry that included music. Due to evolving standards and practices with how licensed music is implemented and tracked across games and content, this wasnât the case at launch and we decided to switch the name to \"Alternate Music\" to better set expectations for our streaming community.

Something about the next gen and the gameplay, *chef’s kiss* I miss playing that game so much and I will find a way to play it (I have series s rn) I loved the my career so much and I felt so dominant. I didn’t very much care of the characters to choose from but it wasn’t terrible. The soundtracked low key was a bop. MyGM wasn’t terrible either and was pretty fun. The graphics in that game felt so cool especially since I just got an Xbox one and this was the game on my list at the time. \n\n2nd gotta be a tie between 2k11 and 2k16 and here’s why: 11 is so nostalgic to me, always. It was my first ever full game on disc 2k I ever got for like Christmas or something. It was for pc, but I didn’t care I plugged in my transparent light-up green Xbox controller and played for hours. I loved the Jordan mode so much. Create a legend was fun and I played so much MyCareer.\n2k16: the my career imo was so fun. I loved the story, I replayed it a few times until I found my favorite build. I loved the soundtrack and THE MENU was so fire at the time. I played this one for hours too. I believe it was the Spike Lee Joint and I just kinda vibed with it lmfao. Even if it was a little cringe at times. \n\n3rd I would put 2k13. That game was super fun and I played the shit out of it before 14. It was like 11 but much better. The last year of create a legend as well. The my career wasn’t bad either. I much preferred 14 instead in that instance. The soundtrack was fire too. \n\nI would also put 2k18 on here. Ik not many people liked it but I kinda really enjoyed the MyCareer on it a lot and remember being a star pg on the bucks and won a few chips with Giannis. It was one my favorites too. \n\n*sorry I didn’t usually play my team until literally 2k23. I really enjoyed my team on there but heard 22 was much better. I never played that one, and wasn’t really into much other mode than black top, play now, and my career, maybe the create a legends back then.*\n\n## Comment ID l67wbq6 with +1 score by [(symbolic503, Reddit, 2024-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/1d38th2/what_is_the_best_nba_2k_games/l67wbq6/) (in reply to ID 1d38th2):\njust gonna casually leave out 2k1?? wow\n\n## Comment ID l67xl4m with +1 score by [(basketballrene, Reddit, 2024-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/1d38th2/what_is_the_best_nba_2k_games/l67xl4m/) (in reply to ID 1d38th2):\nWhatever the last one that didn't have virtual currency.\n\n## Comment ID l67xriv with +1 score by [(michael151722, Reddit, 2024-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/1d38th2/what_is_the_best_nba_2k_games/l67xriv/) (in reply to ID 1d38th2):\n2K11 my team was pretty goated tbh\n\n## Comment ID l67y2lj with +1 score by [(fozzy_13, Reddit, 2024-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/1d38th2/what_is_the_best_nba_2k_games/l67y2lj/) (in reply to ID 1d38th2):\n2k11 is the goat imo.

Me and my friends say the whole badge system is just the tendency system they had in 2k12 just reworked. 2k13 was new dribbling mechanics, 2k14 was  the first next gen and too this day still has the best story mode for my career why they made it way less interactive every year after I’ll never know why.

They were more fun, and less sweaty than every 2K since.\n\n2k19, 2k21 and 23 were okay, this game is dogshit. I’m tired of getting scored on by literally unblockable layups like that stupid ass one that happens when directly under the basket. \n\nIt’s the one that you can get off if you get an offensive rebound a lot. You probably know what I mean, it’s really hard to contest.\n\nIt’s so dumb, I’ve tested and tried to do so even in MyTeam with players that can do everything. Even Dark Matter whoever can’t stop it. These are layup animations that are literally immune to defense. Can’t stop them.\n\nThen there’s the ones where they can jump up, miss a layup, and immediately jump again. No matter what pogo stick level you have, it’s impossible to stop these. \n\nThen there’s the animations where you jump up, miss a layup, land, somehow can jump again before the defender has even landed, and dunk it.\n\nAnd people say these new games are good? These kids just don’t know what good shit is anymore,\nCOD has been ass for like 10 years, 2K has been going downhill for 7.\n\n## Comment ID l6bbuhp with +1 score by [(Outrageous-Estimate5, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/1d38th2/what_is_the_best_nba_2k_games/l6bbuhp/) (in reply to ID 1d38th2):\nNBA 2k11 is the best the worst is 2k2\n\n## Comment ID l6bcnzw with +1 score by [(Usual-Difficulty-958, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/1d38th2/what_is_the_best_nba_2k_games/l6bcnzw/) (in reply to ID 1d38th2):\n13\n\n## Comment ID l6bekht with +1 score by [(Michaelskywalker, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/1d38th2/what_is_the_best_nba_2k_games/l6bekht/) (in reply to ID 1d38th2):\n11 16 19 15 14\n\n## Comment ID l6bgnj5 with +1 score by [(HeavFnu, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/1d38th2/what_is_the_best_nba_2k_games/l6bgnj5/) (in reply to ID 1d38th2):\n2k16 for sure but 2k17 story will stay forever in my heart\n\n## Comment ID l6bm8i8 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/1d38th2/what_is_the_best_nba_2k_games/l6bm8i8/) (in reply to ID 1d38th2):\nWhich ever one you had to actually do the moves in order to get the badge you wanted instead of making a build that was capable of getting said badge\n\n## Comment ID l6bpu9t with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/1d38th2/what_is_the_best_nba_2k_games/l6bpu9t/) (in reply to ID 1d38th2):\nI mean Snoop Dogg literally made a song about it \"NBA 2k11 best game ever made\"\n\n## Comment ID l6bsot3 with +1 score by [(Biggestbic22, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/1d38th2/what_is_the_best_nba_2k_games/l6bsot3/) (in reply to ID 1d38th2):\n2k11 by far.. that Jordan theme music start up still the best intro to me.\n\n## Comment ID l6bu0nn with +1 score by [(jak_The_god, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/1d38th2/what_is_the_best_nba_2k_games/l6bu0nn/) (in reply to ID 1d38th2):\nWhere tf is 2k17 and 2k20?\n\n## Comment ID l6bu9sg with +1 score by [(HELT-1021, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/1d38th2/what_is_the_best_nba_2k_games/l6bu9sg/) (in reply to ID 1d38th2):\n2k11 without a doubt.\n\n2k14 is a close second for me, could just be nostalgia though.\n\n## Comment ID l6c35cu with +1 score by [(Fast_Door, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/1d38th2/what_is_the_best_nba_2k_games/l6c35cu/) (in reply to ID 1d38th2):\nProlly gonna get flak for this but as far as gameplay alone goes, 24 should be up there.

This was like 2k9-16. The beginning of the end for me was 2k16 and the spike Lee joint. I could see the direction they were starting to go where myplayer mode was their story and narrative they wanted to push , not yours. I kind of stopped playing myplayer after that and just did quick games and legends. I never got into online but since they started pushing hard for my team and all the player cards like Madden ultimate team and pushing vc for all other modes, the game has kind of lost its interest to me. I still play it for quick games and legends and I like the eras mode they added because I always enjoy messing with those older teams. But that's not worth $70 so I wait for discount now. Usually can get it for half price by Christmas or new years. There are always sales and by then most of bugs are ironed out . It's not worth buying at launch ever. Also some years I've just waited until end of season it usually ends up on game pass or ps plus once season is over.

If you like to make up your own story and character, going for any titles and achievements you desire, then it’s a pick from 2K15 to 2K18. From 2K19 onwards tho, you end up having much more of a “story” factor, with various storylines, additional characters and pre-determined win/win matches.

Your basically just getting a cloud PC that works for gaming.\n\nPublishers pulling out don't see enough money because they want folks to buy the game twice when it comes to any form of streaming or they want bigger cuts of money from Nvidia.\n\nWhat I don't get is why publishers would get any money out of this. Nvidia are letting gamers stream games they already bought. It really has nothing to do with them in a way.  It's just opening up another market with already established providers and doesn't negate established gamers. Allowing them to enjoy both without buying the same game twice\n\n### Comment ID fjq4xq5 with +18 score by [(padmanek, Reddit, 2020-03-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShieldAndroidTV/comments/fen7wp/2k_games_pulls_out_of_geforce_now_too_latest/fjq4xq5/) (in reply to ID fjpiofn):\nI'm really puzzled by this.

Plus anti-consumer, rent-seeking exploitation.*\n\n********************\nThe larger argument is developer and publisher controls over where their games are played. Many of them didn't sign on to have their titles virtualized and remote played. Especially not on mobile devices or console-like devices (see ShieldTV, or potentially the Switch).\n\nESPECIALLY not when they could potentially have a port to those environments that would require you to pay for the title again. No hate on Blizzard, but example would be Overwatch. It isn't F2P, and they specifically state in the ToS no virtualization allowed (so they are fully within their rights to yank it, as shitty as it is). Further, you pay for Overwatch on EACH platform you want to play it on. PC? You pay. Switch? You pay again. Xbox or PlayStation? Yet again you pay.  See again with CoD, BattleField, FIFA, Madden, BioShock, BorderLands, etc. Even Nintendo makes you re-buy titles from older platforms if they don't have a direct interface for upgraded play (See original DS versus Gameboy/GBColor and GBAdvance games as a really good example, or PS2 playing PS1/PSX games if you want to look at Sony)\n\nSo the sudden ability for NVidia to just virtualize a PC game that you have a license to use and let you play it on any device that they could churn out an interface app for means that they lose out on all those potential sales, as well as platform specific development (say motion controls for Switch like what was done with Overwatch for fast turns and such). Further, for competitive games you now not only have to deal with your game's netcode, but now you have to deal with the induced lag of  compression, server transit, decompression, and then round trip of the HID/controller interface button presses back to the server and their acknowledgment of receipt. So this can induce more lag, which people WILL BITCH ABOUT TREMENDOUSLY (especially on said competitive twitch-reaction games like fighting games, FPS or even rhythm games). So you'll get even more support to deal with which costs money and damages public reputation.\n\nNow of course, most of this complaint is due to rent-seeking and incredibly consumer-hostile. The consumer bought their license for PC, is running it on a PC (albeit virtualized) just in a remote location. With Steam you can't run a license in more than one location at a time, even if you are logged into more than one location. So you can't fire up a copy of MegaMan11 on a laptop and another copy on a desktop from the same account. You already could stream it from the desktop to your TV or mobile phone using GameStream/Moonlight or another desktop streaming service/app.\n\nEVEN FARTHER THAN THIS, there are companies (like Shadow PC) which offer full virtualized PC environments in the cloud that you can stream real-time, which can have games installed and run on them. So really the virtualization point is moot, the licenses are portable, and the publishers have very little _LEGAL_ standing to expressly forbid the use of virtualization or location shifting services (most terms in a TOS that would try to lock this down would be thrown out in court should it ever come down to an actual lawsuit).\n\nThat make it a little clearer?\n\n#### Comment ID fjqq3ik with +4 score by [(Zeal514, Reddit, 2020-03-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShieldAndroidTV/comments/fen7wp/2k_games_pulls_out_of_geforce_now_too_latest/fjqq3ik/) (in reply to ID fjq74x3):\nMakes sense, but people like me just won't buy or play their games now.

Once again *before a second is played*).\n\nThe amount of bloatware and advertising you have to sift through (how many fucking cards do I have to turn over before I can play?) is fucking insane.\n\nThese games haven't been enjoyable in years and this is why.\n\nRant over.\n\n## Comment ID kxyblw7 with +493 score by [(JohnnyNole2000, Reddit, 2024-04-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1bvb89j/nba_2k_games_have_become_a_haven_of_bloat_and_crap/kxyblw7/) (in reply to ID 1bvb89j):\nWelcome to modern sports games\n\n### Comment ID kxyu19g with +124 score by [(maybe-an-ai, Reddit, 2024-04-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1bvb89j/nba_2k_games_have_become_a_haven_of_bloat_and_crap/kxyu19g/) (in reply to ID kxyblw7):\nYeah, exclusivity really benefited the gaming community.

Madden.  I remember doing online \"GM leagues\" back in the '00s (we'd build the rosters and set game plans, then let the CPU play head-to-head games while someone broadcast them using some old screen sharing program).  Loads of fun.  Played Madden on my PC a lot during that time.  Plenty of depth to franchise and so much fun.\n\nThen Madden disappears from PC.  Comes back finally.  But aside from the usual issues with Madden dropping in quality over time (and having a barebones franchise mode compared to back then), they doubled up by leaving PC \"last gen\" when they first made a newer \"next gen\" Madden, then this year they finally bring the \"next gen\" to PC... and it's such a crap port that for a lot of us it doesn't run right.  The game has insane stuttering.  People with all kinds of PC specs have experienced it.  EA has no answer and just ignored it.  So Madden 24 is still completely unplayable to a lot of us on PC.\n\nIt's insane how lazy a company can be while still making loads and money and being rewarded for it.  But here we are.  People eagerly throwing cash at Ultimate Team means they don't have to improve the game.\n\n### Comment ID kxz2jlf with +12 score by [(alexjg42, Reddit, 2024-04-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1bvb89j/nba_2k_games_have_become_a_haven_of_bloat_and_crap/kxz2jlf/) (in reply to ID kxyblw7):\nI feel like there's a gap in the indie market for good fun sports games.

After that you choose what kind of shot you want to make, hold circle + L1 and similarly tilt the joystick and release at the correct timing for accuracy. Then there's your followup action, and that was also complicated.\n\nPass and shoot, what ever happened to that.\n\nThey've put systems upon systems in front of what should be simple actions.

MyTeam and Parks were in their infancy and weren’t yet a toxic hellscape. \n\nIt was still mainly built around a great franchise mode and 12 had the jordan edition(?) for extra flavor. Online PVP was decent. After that stretch I played 15, 17, 19, 21, 23 and nothing really has changed besides shooting becoming incredibly difficult.

They straight up said in an article months before Battlefront II released that they liked the Ultimate Team model and wanted to put it into more games of varying types.  Fast forward to late 2017, and you've got Battlefront II with its loot box based progression system using cards, trying to push people to throw (more) money at the game to progress their classes and heroes.\n\nThing is, as much as people threw a fit over that (and politicians talked it up to get air time and then promptly forgot it), it seems people largely missed that they did the same system in a Need For Speed game they released at the same time, where you upgraded your car with cards you got from lootboxes.\n\nIf EA hadn't tried pushing it with a big IP (and one whose owning company was willing to tell EA to cut that shit out or they'd terminate the contract early), we'd probably see card based progression in Battlefield and other EA franchises, multiple games with Ultimate Team style \"progression\" that's shamelessly pay to win.

The current season I'm playing (because it's the only basketball game worth anything and I get the itch to play during the NBA season) I'm 44-0 with a point differential of 33.5.

However, if I go back and play it, it is so stale and boring to play. WWE 2K as a franchise has the best customization in gaming period. The gameplay is really good too. My problems with current 2K is that there is no solid mode I can hook myself into to enjoy the gameplay. GM Mode gets old after some time. MyFaction isn't my thing. Exhibition is for when friends want to play with you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUniverse Mode is supposed to be THE mode you play to get the full TV show experience. It devolved so poorly over the years though. It started off capturing the unpredictability of the TV show, and made you keep playing to find out what happens next. Now, it has become a \"create your own fun!\" mode where people have to maintain spreadsheets and now you even have to choose your own cutscenes; stripping out the last bit of unpredictability this mode did have. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't have any expectations from Universe mode in 2k24 either. The devs talked so half-heartedly about it. I am hoping that GM Mode is able to be replayable and exciting over the course of the year through the new features they added.\n\n### Comment ID kjl67nv with +2 score by [(zickomondo, Reddit, 2024-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/19fkbrv/sorry_those_that_hate_the_2k_wwe_games_why_what/kjl67nv/) (in reply to ID kjkg84q):\nI think story designer would fill that void you're missing.

When you try to program something new, there is a ton of testing to ensure it doesn't break what's already there. Licensed games bring another complication because everything you do must also be approved by the IP holder, often down to the smallest detail.\n\n**Tldr; what we think is simple to include, is made difficult because game publishers of licensed annual titles refuse to allow developers sufficient time to include everything we want and to get it right.**\n\n### Comment ID kjl5txy with +2 score by [(zickomondo, Reddit, 2024-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/19fkbrv/sorry_those_that_hate_the_2k_wwe_games_why_what/kjl5txy/) (in reply to ID kjkqrbs):\nI want those back as well but I understand that VC had to start almost from scratch after 2k20.

I just feel like the sheer FUN we used to have in wrestling games isn't really there anymore. I credit SvR 08 with being the first game where I felt like a drastic shift was made, and suddenly the heart and soul that was put into the games before it was gone. Games since have been perfectly functional, and there's fun to be had here and there, but that feeling we used to have of \"I can't put this down\" or \"just one more match!\" hasn't been present since then. And yes I'm including games that are weirdly praised today like SvR 11, 2K14 or 2K19...which in my eyes are just \"okay\". They're there, they exist...but I never understood why people love them so much. \n\nI think a big thing for me is that I was one of those people championing wrestling games becoming more simulation based, but I realized...all too late...that, that isn't what I want. Everything became so serious and trying to mimic the TV product (especially during times when WWE was at it's worst), and I just realized how much I prefer the Arcadey stuff of the AKI games or the Smackdown games, or DoR, or SvR 06 and 07. These are games I still go back to today, and I still have an absolute blast with them...it's not just nostalgia goggles, they REALLY do still hold up. This idea of \"missing heart and soul\" isn't just some construct I thought up...going back to these games shows me that I really can feel that difference.\n\nI do give a lot credit to 2K22 and 23 (and hopefully 24), I think I've had MORE fun in those than I have in anything since SvR 08. But the games have their clear flaws, and don't hold my attention like the old games STILL do. They're more like fun little distractions, rather than games I can't wait to play again the next day. \n\nIf I could take today's sheer amount of content (except MyFaction) and just put it in No Mercy or Here Comes the Pain, I'd probably feel right at home.\n\n### Comment ID kjkvmri with +4 score by [(Mando316, Reddit, 2024-01-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/19fkbrv/sorry_those_that_hate_the_2k_wwe_games_why_what/kjkvmri/) (in reply to ID kjktjjl):\nYooooo are you my doppelgänger or something?

I miss the old kind of over the top stuff involved in the brawls and stuff from previous games. Plus some kind of more ridiculous stuff in the story modes and stuff.

For context for my points, I play mainly Ai vs Ai with 95% custom creations.\n\nFor stuff I’d add, firstly some kind of chain wrestling, an improved system to 2k19. It would be a good basis, but more variation, more benefit to do it, more control over who can actually do it(I’m a sucker for making wrestlers wrestle in the way I envision, AI tendencies was great for that).\n\nAlongside that, some general revamp and improvements to submissions. Submissions in terms of watching are in a good place, they got rid of some annoying issues (fuck anytime the Ai doesn’t win by submission but goes for the pin straight after and wins, I hated that so much), but there’s some areas I’d like improved, like I want rope breaks to mean something with submissions, it would add more dimension in the minigame if you could choose between fighting the hold or crawling to the ropes/dragging opponents to the ropes.\n\nAnother thing would be limb damage being more impactful. It would probably be difficult to balance, but I want high body part damage to mean more, for it to have more of an affect, like power moves may get cancelled because you can’t hold their weight because of a bad back, or you take longer to climb the ropes due to a leg injury. It would be difficult to manage it being fun but impactful, but I’d love to see a feature like that implemented more.\n\nAlso, just making tag matches actually fun to watch, as in Ai v Ai they are so boring, they drag out, they are so slow compared to how fast paced they can be in real life, and they just aren’t interesting\n\n### Comment ID kjl8gj4 with +2 score by [(zickomondo, Reddit, 2024-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/19fkbrv/sorry_those_that_hate_the_2k_wwe_games_why_what/kjl8gj4/) (in reply to ID kjl3hyn):\nUgh ai tags are the worst.\n\n#### Comment ID kjnelpd with +1 score by [(JustC88, Reddit, 2024-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/19fkbrv/sorry_those_that_hate_the_2k_wwe_games_why_what/kjnelpd/) (in reply to ID kjl8gj4):\nAgreed, I run a universe with my friends just ai v ai and we have a tag division but never watch any matches because they suck\n\n## Comment ID kjmz50t with +3 score by [(Kiel297, Reddit, 2024-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/19fkbrv/sorry_those_that_hate_the_2k_wwe_games_why_what/kjmz50t/) (in reply to ID 19fkbrv):\nIt’s not even about what other wrestling games are better to be honest, because this series of games doesn’t have direct competition, and that’s kind of the problem.\n\nYou have to understand, some of us have been playing these from the beginning. I’m talking SmackDown! For the Playstation 1.\n\nEvery single year lately there is something it seems. Features removed, janky character models, buggy game play.\n\nFeatures being removed is one of the kickers for me. We used to have such a good advanced entrance creator, there was story designer. Season mode got replaced with a slightly watered down Road To Wrestlemania, which got replaced with an even more watered down Showcase mode.\n\nThis series has been in a serious decline in quality for years and it is very apparent that 2K don’t actually care whether we’re happy with the product or not, just as long as we keep spending money.\n\nThat’s my problem with these games. That’s why I went from being a guaranteed day one purchase every year and even setting up this subreddit cos I loved the games so much, to refusing to spend money until I have proof that it’s actually good. 2K19 was the last time I pre-ordered. 2K20 and 2K22 I didn’t buy, 2K23 I got in a humble bundle.\n\nIt’s not about other games being better. There doesn’t need to be a better game for me to think that these ones aren’t good enough.\n\nI’m really hoping that 2K24 delivers more than they have the last few years.\n\n### Comment ID kjo4lv6 with +1 score by [(zickomondo, Reddit, 2024-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/19fkbrv/sorry_those_that_hate_the_2k_wwe_games_why_what/kjo4lv6/) (in reply to ID kjmz50t):\nI agree 100% with you. I also have been playing wrestling games since NES, so I know what a good wrestling game should look and feel like. I just think too many people nitpick at the 2k games without ever uplifting any other title. We all have the same problem with the 2k games, so I asked if there were other games people prefer because I'd like to try those.\n\nI also think that a lot of people feel nostalgic for the older games as opposed to wanting an exact replica of those games. They just remember how much fun wrestling games felt 10 years ago. I was 30 in 2014, and even then I think back to how much people were complaining about little things in 2k14.

Every new title has something going for it, new innovation, new roster addition, new realism mechanic, new camera angles etc. etc. yet with every new WWE game and every new addition to it, keeping the player playing the game and having fun doing so is never something that's considered. I'd also say that for my age group (late 20s to early 30s) it is hard to get into these 2K games because we were very spoiled with what we had early on. The first wrestling game I ever touched was No Mercy and I must have been like 5 or 6 years old. That was my initial benchmark for a wrestling game. Later down the line, we got S tier titles like Shut Your Mouth, Here Comes the Pain, Smackdown vs Raw, Smackdown vs Raw 2006, & the Day of Reckoning series all one right after the other.\n\nIt is just SAD when for the first time in YEARS I pick up a new title, WWE 2k18, and it's slower, buggier, less fun, less interactive, and less satisfying than the PS2 titles and on top of all this garbage, they even have the NERVE to make me purchase loot boxes in order to unlock clothes for my CAW's career mode. I'm sorry, but I just shouldn't be getting a better, fuller, less grindy and more fun experience playing HCTP on the PS2 than the latest 2K game on my high end PC.\n\n## Comment ID kjl26kb with +7 score by [(jackblady, Reddit, 2024-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/19fkbrv/sorry_those_that_hate_the_2k_wwe_games_why_what/kjl26kb/) (in reply to ID 19fkbrv):\nWhy do I dislike the games?\n\nThey are unfinished and broken, with some glitches lasting for years.

The leanring curve is steep, but it is incredible. There's also King Of Colosseum, which is fire pro in 3d with a few extra elements. \n\nPersonally, I love the first GM mode and wish that I could play this with modern wrestlers. I don't want all the restrictions of later games, but being able to do stories and such would be much more fun. I want just a perfect GM mode\n\nI also want a really great university mode as well, I wish they would pump most of their resources into that. Along with match types, but it seems we will be getting them\n\nI like older wwe games in the sense of the arcade feeling and just insane fun. In HCTP you can climb up times Square and toss someone off. You can climb up a helicopter snd dive off onto a limo. I've probably played more HCTP than any other wrestling game. \n\nWrestling empire is in a weird state, it's an absolute terrible mess of a game. It's clunky, it's ugly, but it is absolutely a blast to play. It controls terribly and is an awful Wrestling game, but as far as being able to have 90 sticks of dynamite in the ring as the match starts or have 30 people inside of a cage match, that's the game for you.

There shouldn't be a WWE wrestling game every single year because not enough has changed really, maybe a wrestling game every three to five years maybe but not every year.\n\n## Comment ID kv1hxow with +1 score by [(Molotovs4TW, Reddit, 2024-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/19fkbrv/sorry_those_that_hate_the_2k_wwe_games_why_what/kv1hxow/) (in reply to ID 19fkbrv):\nFor me I like the Wrestling games, \n➕I like to create my own made up wrestlers and existing ones that aren’t in the game, my main focus you’d see me with these games is CAW/all the other creator tools, (like Arena, championship, etc), Universe mode and myGM (all these modes have something that could be worked on or tweaked for sure)\n\n ➖ I don’t care for the “myfaction” mode, I just never cared much for card games on video games in general, especially when the mode is un usable after awhile since it seems to be only online, it’s useless at that point, never understood the appeal, I’d rather get DLC of more wrestlers as well and not have digital cards take up that space when we could just get those alternate suits/wrestlers. \nI also wish these games would give us more slots for CAW (I’d even pay a one time small fee for that if that was the case). \nI also wish they would have the alternate versions of wrestlers not taking up space for other potential wrestlers, like DLC alternate suits or earned show case mode suits, all that should be within a separate list under the main/current version of the wrestler (that was always a gripe with me), for example in WWE 2k22 we have 8 alternate versions of Rey Mysterio that takes up a spot, once we select Rey all of those suits should be under the main current version of Rey in my opinion” even when we make an alternate version of our own of an existing wrestler in the game, that shouldn’t be in the CAW list imo maybe in a list of its own since its using an already made model of a wrestler just with different suits and what not.\n\n## Comment ID kxx03yc with +1 score by [(TheAccursedHamster, Reddit, 2024-04-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/19fkbrv/sorry_those_that_hate_the_2k_wwe_games_why_what/kxx03yc/) (in reply to ID 19fkbrv):\nI like simulation.

Something I can pick up quick, something I can have a friend or my dad over and explain the basics enough to get by to just play. \n\nI can appreciate the joy stick motions and combos and advanced reversals but there needs to be an option to dumb it down. NHL even still has options to use NHL 94 controls. (Which I use current skill stick controls so don’t call me a boomer). \n\nSomething between HCTP and SvR 2010 would be ideal of simplicity/arcade style but enough of realism. Though for reference my heyday was between KYR and SvR 05\n\nAll Stars and Battlegrounds were way too over the top for me. I like graphical realism but not long, drawn out simulated animations. Let me get goofy with quick strikes, quick grapples, fast reaction reversals. \n\nPaywalls, FOMO tactics, exclusivities ruined any interest I’d ever have. I don’t mind a grind, I like season modes, in-game currency. I don’t want real money involved. I want to be able to unlock everything through gameplay, and be able to use any character with any attire in any mode. It’s 2024 and we are creating more technical barriers than opening. As an IT guy it’s so infuriating to watch a company create false barriers just to use monetary incentive to justify them. \n\nI don’t have any current wrestling game I play. Still on my PS2. Unfortunately AEW’s option was extremely underwhelming though I think it was going in the better direction than 2K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID kjkgx9c with +1 score by [(xSEARLEYx, Reddit, 2024-01-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/19fkbrv/sorry_those_that_hate_the_2k_wwe_games_why_what/kjkgx9c/) (in reply to ID 19fkbrv):\nA gripe I have with the games is how outdated they are at launch.

Let me roll out during royal rumbles, increase 8 active entrants, stack tables, tables and ladders not falling down when people slide in the ring, not have to grapple before every move, let every payback be used online, random elimination chamber entrants, more weapon attacks, weapons being part of the environment (i.e. if I suplex someone onto a ladder, it should hurt more than the mat), more meaningful MyRise decisions and freedoms (I like the idea of MyRise but it has sucked the past two years), reverse moves into other moves instead of just having a single reversal animation.

My main complaint is rivalries in universe mode are just stupid. You face your rival for 4 weeks before the PLE. Yes in some cases it'll switch it but that's worse for people who want full control. I would just play 2k19 but i want an updated roster so I get bored extremely fast. The gameplay isn't too big of a problem but i prefer simulation gameplay over the arcade gameplay we have now. I like a slower pace. I want it to feel like a real match. I think having an option to switch between the two would be nice and would make both sides happy. Other than that i like the current game. I love the customization and cross platform CC. MyRise was fun. I didn't like showcase but they can't do everything perfect.",

I’ve recently moved towns and joined a very chill club, so chill that a lot of the time is spent nattering and going to see pivotal points of other games so often turn 3 was a mythical and rarely seen event at 1500pts let alone 2k. (Very different to my previous clubs where a 2k game could be hashed out in under an hour and a half) as such the whole club decided to move to 1000pts and honestly it’s great. \n\nIt’s a really fun point level because even if someone brings a mega combo of doom it doesn’t have the support it needs to actually win, so it has led to more varied and interesting lists as you can’t bring every tool you would at 2k. We also had a lot of fun with boarding action which is 500pts (you should definitely play boarding action!)\n\n## Comment ID k1ougau with +1 score by [(DeathGuard1978, Reddit, 2023-09-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/16or6p8/does_anyone_ever_play_less_than_2k_games/k1ougau/) (in reply to ID 16or6p8):\nAt my gaming club we cut right down to skirmish games kill team and Warcry, for normal games 500pts is the go to, sometimes 1000pts, anything else takes too long for us.\n\n## Comment ID k1ougjn with +1 score by [(Chipperz1, Reddit, 2023-09-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/16or6p8/does_anyone_ever_play_less_than_2k_games/k1ougjn/) (in reply to ID 16or6p8):\n1) Yeah, all the time.  1k games are a ton of fun and Combat Patrol is a blast.\n\n2) Honestly, not as much as people online will say.  It's easier to specialise your army, but as a result it's as easy to screw up and bring something that is useless against your opponent's list so trying to be more tactical still makes more sense than taking all tanks or something.  A *lot* of the complaints are true of 2k games too - new players don't have the tools or the skills to beat skew lists anyway, and an arsehole is an arsehole whether they're playing Combat Patrol or Apocalypse.\n\n## Comment ID k1p1i15 with +1 score by [(Vividworlds, Reddit, 2023-09-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/16or6p8/does_anyone_ever_play_less_than_2k_games/k1p1i15/) (in reply to ID 16or6p8):\nI love playing all point sizes \nIf you and your opponent get the rules down \nYou can play 2k in about 1 and a half hours on average\n\n## Comment ID k1q8l2e with +1 score by [(Melodic-Pirate4309, Reddit, 2023-09-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/16or6p8/does_anyone_ever_play_less_than_2k_games/k1q8l2e/) (in reply to ID 16or6p8):\nMy group has been playing 1k games to get us back into the swing of 40k, especially because a lot of us have started new armies. \n\n2k is what most people play because the game feels most balanced at that points level, at least for most armies. 2k points allows you to bring forth more of a build with your army than 1500 or 1k can. The feel of some armies at 1k vs 2k is drastically different, especially because you're less likely to see as many vehicles, high damage weaponry or high amounts of infantry as compared to something like a 2k game. You have to bring only what you can't live without at 1k where at 2k you're offered a bit more wiggle room to work on things like synergies.\n\n## Comment ID k1r0ca3 with +1 score by [(APhysicistAbroad, Reddit, 2023-09-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/16or6p8/does_anyone_ever_play_less_than_2k_games/k1r0ca3/) (in reply to ID 16or6p8):\n2k is a special big game for me and my bud.

And even though I enter EVERY bit of information correctly, I can't even register my purchase for a refund to purchase again through a new link. And now we have to wait an entire day AFTER release to play the game?? What an absolute joke this whole experience has been.

And from the sound of it, contacting xsolla directly would be pointless.. pretty bummed about all this and hoping I don't have to refund and repurchase AGAIN just to play today.

Do not expect anything from 2k that you haven’t gotten from EAFC. \n\nThere’s a few different things that 2k does but it makes the game just as miserable. \n\n1. There’s always, of course, full meta, for example heighth which is just as important as pace in EAFC\n\n2. You thought pack odds in EAFC are bad? lol, wait until you get <1% on every pack for super rare cards, they don’t even tell you the odds, one guy spent about $2.5k to get a rare card from the drop, live on stream. Packs cost just as much if not more.\n\n3. Gameplay is consistant. _That doesn’t mean it’s good_, but it is consistant, you learn which animations are going to happen (at least with their engine), randomness factor still exists (but not as much as there is in eafc).\n\n4. It’s barely playable on PC. 2k on PC is full of cheaters, using algorhytms etc. to green time their shots, modding their players to be 5m tall etc. so I hope that FIFA takes care of the PC side of the game.\n\n5. They don’t do menu grinding and SBCs but I reckon FIFA is going to implement that, they have a Card Collection sort of thing where you get rewards based on how many items have you collected (for example you get Icon Zico for 1k players collected etc.)\n\n6. 2k has an ‘amazing’ MyCareer mod though, much better than you’ve seen in EAFC, including co-op with other people and parks, since the most of the player base is playing that game mode and not the MyTeam (FUT).\n\n7. Expect just as much toxicity (even more if they somehow manage to enable voice chat)\n\n## Comment ID lb83yg0 with +1 score by [(notxbatman, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fut/comments/1as9i3p/whoever_has_plays_2k_games_how_are_they_really_is/lb83yg0/) (in reply to ID 1as9i3p):\nThe gameplay itself in 2K games are generally good and in some cases better than EA, but MTX absolutely infest the single player to the point where you genuinely consider buying VC so that you can get more than 2 minutes of court time being a \\~50ovr in a league of 90s.\n\n## Comment ID kqoul2e with +1 score by [(GuyIncognito211, Reddit, 2024-02-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fut/comments/1as9i3p/whoever_has_plays_2k_games_how_are_they_really_is/kqoul2e/) (in reply to ID 1as9i3p):\n2K are basically everything people hate about EA but amplified x 1000\n\n## Comment ID kqoup2k with +1 score by [(LKMarleigh, Reddit, 2024-02-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fut/comments/1as9i3p/whoever_has_plays_2k_games_how_are_they_really_is/kqoup2k/) (in reply to ID 1as9i3p):\nToday 2k are releasing a 100 rated card, which can only be packed, they have no player market, the card is way ahead of the power curve, and pack odds are terrible\n\n### Comment ID kqoxqqz with +2 score by [(Own-Bandicoot6348, Reddit, 2024-02-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fut/comments/1as9i3p/whoever_has_plays_2k_games_how_are_they_really_is/kqoxqqz/) (in reply to ID kqoup2k):\nThey will surely open a market feature.

That MyTeam experience is nothing like the experience you get after release.\n\n#### Comment ID kqoznr5 with +1 score by [(LKMarleigh, Reddit, 2024-02-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fut/comments/1as9i3p/whoever_has_plays_2k_games_how_are_they_really_is/kqoznr5/) (in reply to ID kqow5p2):\nThey removed the auction house this year\n\n### Comment ID krqymub with +1 score by [(chickensteakmushroom, Reddit, 2024-02-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fut/comments/1as9i3p/whoever_has_plays_2k_games_how_are_they_really_is/krqymub/) (in reply to ID kqoup2k):\nThis is the same as efootball, while they got the free to play tittles but they are actually heavily pay to win, even you safe up much coin you can never be able to get alot of iconic moments players.\n\nEven ea fc you can still buy those players in market at least you got a hope you can obtain them with in game currency through transfer market.\n\n## Comment ID kqouuly with +1 score by [(flockavelli8, Reddit, 2024-02-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fut/comments/1as9i3p/whoever_has_plays_2k_games_how_are_they_really_is/kqouuly/) (in reply to ID 1as9i3p):\n2k is pretty awful, idk about the cheater part but any ultimate team or pro club mode will be pay to win 100%\n\n## Comment ID kqov3dy with +1 score by [(ThdClickk, Reddit, 2024-02-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fut/comments/1as9i3p/whoever_has_plays_2k_games_how_are_they_really_is/kqov3dy/) (in reply to ID 1as9i3p):\nMicro transactions imo are worse on 2K than fifa, online play can be beyond anything you’ll see in fifa in terms of lag, their matchmaking is awful and across the years they have had a lot of things happen like ‘Messigate’. In 2K the main focus isn’t on their version of UT but more so about people using an individual character of their own creation to play as part of a team within multiple game modes inside of the one mode. I can imagine it actually being a lot worse than any fifa game\n\n## Comment ID kqowpvh with +1 score by [(NBKDexx, Reddit, 2024-02-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fut/comments/1as9i3p/whoever_has_plays_2k_games_how_are_they_really_is/kqowpvh/) (in reply to ID 1as9i3p):\n2k definitely had problems with Cronus‘ and other devices of that kind. \n\nThey don’t really have an anticheat or have figured out how to deal with people quitting games. They throw out bans left and right for quits in gameplay. ( Yes this includes when your game crashes ) Their matchmaking is terrible as well. \n\nIn terms of greed I’d class them above EA. They really push the MTX envelope and blast you full with VC advertisements in the game. Up to a point where if you don’t spend money you can forget to be competitive without having to put in 200 hours of completely braindead grinding. \n\nI really have no faith in 2k delivering a good product."

I recommend do personal work on the side, no matter how much you may not want to after 40hrs a week at this factory.\r\nThe pay is good if you came from working a day-job at the mall. Just don't compare your salary to other large game companies if you want to stay in blissful ignorance.

Water seeks its own level. And the watermark is high here.\r\n\r\nEveryone here has met two tenets: Exceptional talent and exceptional character. We have a no a-holes policy. No level of skill or ability excuses toxic personalities. We believe Trust matters most towards an environment of psychological safety where we can take risks to innovate and grow to achieve excellence in all we do.\r\n\r\nWe laugh a LOT here and we work hard. We believe that you can bring your best and whole self to work and that will make you, the team and game better. We value each other as people first. \r\n\r\nI truly look forward to going to work every Monday. I've been fortunate to work in an Industry I love for many years. I'm even more fortunate to be happier than I've ever been in my work at this stage of my career. \r\n\r\n31st Union is a unique team of amazing people. I'm grateful and humbled to be a part of it.",

I recommend do personal work on the side, no matter how much you may not want to after 40hrs a week at this factory.\r\nThe pay is good if you came from working a day-job at the mall. Just don't compare your salary to other large game companies if you want to stay in blissful ignorance.

      "# [2K Games and FIFA partnership on new soccer game may be brewing by Marco Wutz on 2024-02-12](https://www.si.com/videogames/news/2k-games-fifa-soccer-game-hint)\n2K Games and FIFA may be entering a partnership to develop a brand-new soccer game that uses the global soccer association’s licensing, at least according to a hint provided by reliable insider Kurakasis. They’ve recently been correct about the new Sonic Generations and Metro VR games on top of digging out the official title of MachineGames’ upcoming Indiana Jones game, so their credibility is pretty high at the moment.\n\n2K Games is known for publishing sports game series such as NBA 2K and WWE 2K, but has been out of the soccer game arena for years, which has mostly been dominated by EA Sports and Konami with their FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer franchises respectively. However, with the somewhat botched transformation of PES to eFootball and EA not renewing its licensing deal with the global soccer association to continue using the FIFA branding, an opening for 2K to try and return to the discipline may have opened.\n\nA potential partnership between 2K and FIFA certainly has been on everyone’s mind ever since EA and its long term partner broke up, though we hadn’t heard anything concrete about it other than FIFA stating that it would continue to invest into games with its official branding.\n\nBack in March 2023, recently re-elected FIFA boss Gianni Infantino infamously said that “the new FIFA game – the FIFA 25, 26, 27 and so on – will always be the best egame for any girl or boy, we will have news on this very soon.”\n\nThat promised piece of news has not appeared as of yet and new game releases with the FIFA branding have been sparse – which isn’t a surprise, considering FIFA had reportedly asked EA for $1 billion USD in licensing fees ahead of the break-up. 2K Games is among the very few companies that have both the sports game expertise and the budget to realistically make a FIFA game as fans know it.\n\nAside from the storied name, a partnership with FIFA would allow 2K Games to make the official video game for the soccer world cup held every four years. This tournament will happen next in 2026 with the United States, Canada, and Mexico hosting it as partners – potentially making it a strong debut opportunity for 2K’s soccer title, since the company’s games usually are very focused on the US.\n\nAgain, nothing of this is confirmed, but with Kurakasis’ latest track record and how much sense this partnership makes, the possibility can’t be ignored.",

      "# [2K to reveal new game in one of its \"biggest and most beloved\" franchises next month by Matt Wales on 2024-05-16](https://www.eurogamer.net/2k-to-reveal-new-game-in-one-of-its-biggest-and-most-beloved-franchises-next-month)\n2K Games is poised to reveal the next game in one of its \"biggest and most beloved\" franchises, with the grand unveiling set to happen in June.\n\nMore specifically, the big reveal is scheduled for Friday, 7th June, and will take place during Geoff Keighley's big Summer Game Fest live event.\n\nNews of 2K's impending reveal came via Summer Game Fest's official social media account, but details remain vague. It offered no hints as to what might be coming, leaving everyone to speculate what, exactly, that \"biggest and most beloved\" franchises could be.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nBioShock is an obvious candidate, given 2K confirmed a new series entry was in development all the way back in 2019. Little has been revealed about the project since then, but a report in 2021 claimed the title - which is being developed by new studio Cloud Chamber - would be set in an Antarctic city sometime during the 1960s.\n\nAlternatively, it's possible 2K Games' big reveal will be a new Mafia title - Mafia 3 developer Hangar 13 confirmed it was working on one back in August 2022. As with BioShock, little is known about this latest Mafia project beyond reports it'll be a prequel to the existing trilogy. However, a 2024 reveal might be a little premature given it was still \"a few years away\" when it was announced in 2022.\n\nSo what else? It's always possible Gearbox - which 2K parent company Take-Two Interactive acquired from Embracer earlier this year - will have something to show. References to Borderlands 4 and Tiny Tina's Wonderland 2 both surfaced on a former Gearbox technical director's LinkedIn profile late last year, even though neither has been formally confirmed.\n\nA Borderlands announcement would arguably make the most sense, however, seeing as 2K and Gearbox will almost certainly want to push something out to coincide with the Borderlands movie, which is currently due to hit cinemas in August this year.

However, earlier this year, Insider Gamer reported that FIFA and 2K were “working to announce a partnership for 2K to make an officially-licensed FIFA game.” So this isn’t the first time we’ve seen reports like this.\n\nIn May 2022, Electronic Arts announced the termination of its 30-year agreement with FIFA. As a result, the football game franchise was renamed EA Sports FC, marking the beginning of a new chapter in the company’s history.\n\nEA Sports FC 24, the first installment in the updated series, launched last year and debuted at #1 on the UK Boxed Charts. It also peaked at over 82k concurrent users on Steam alone and reached 11.3 million players in its first week across all platforms.\n\nIf 2K really did manage to secure the official FIFA license, it would be a strong addition to its portfolio of sports game, which includes series such as NBA 2K, PGA Tour 2K, WWE 2K, and Top Spin.",

This game marks the fourth mainline “Borderlands” title and the seventh in the overall franchise, which has sold more than 87 million copies to date.\n\n2K Games parent company Take-Two Interactive revealed in March plans to acquire “Borderlands” maker Gearbox from Embracer Group for $460 million. As part of that deal, which closed in June, Take-Two got the rights to Gearbox IP, including “Borderlands,” “Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands,” “Homeworld,” “Risk of Rain,” “Brothers in Arms” and “Duke Nukem.”\n\nAt the time of the acquisition announcement, Gearbox teased it had six “key interactive entertainment projects in various stages of development,” which included five sequels, two from “Borderlands” and “Homeworld” universes, and at least one “exciting new intellectual property,” all of which have been acquired in the sale. Today’s reveal of “Borderlands 4” marks the first confirmation of one of those projects moving out of the development stage.\n\n“The team and I at Gearbox have a lot we’ve wanted to do with ‘Borderlands’ since we first introduced the looter shooter genre to the world with our original game,” Gearbox founder and president Randy Pitchford said. “All of us at Gearbox have massive ambitions for ‘Borderlands 4’ and are putting everything we have into making everything we love about ‘Borderlands’ better than ever before while taking the game to new levels in exciting new directions.”\n\n“We’re thrilled to be able to share with our fans that 2025 will mark a massive year for 2K and Gearbox Entertainment,” 2K core games senior vice president and general manager Catharina Lavers Mallet said. “The ‘Borderlands’ series is one of 2K’s most successful franchises ever and is beloved by millions globally. We’re excited that our already close partnership and collaboration with the Gearbox team has grown even deeper, and we look forward to delivering best-in-class experiences for both longtime fans and new players alike.”\n\nThe “Borderlands 4” announcement comes on the heels of the “Borderlands” film starring Cate Blanchett recently bombing at the box office.\n\nWatch the trailer for “Borderlands 4” below.",

      "# [2K Games Appears to Be Developing an Unannounced Remake by Alessio Palumbo, www.facebook.com on 2024-07-08](https://wccftech.com/2k-games-appears-to-be-developing-an-unannounced-remake/)\nIt looks like 2K Games is developing an unannounced remake of one of its franchises. As often happens in these cases, the rumor started when MP1st spotted on a LinkedIn resume of a 2K Games 3D artist and Motion Capture Animator the following list of games:\n\nNew Mafia game\n\nNew BioShock game\n\nSupermassive Games project codenamed Erebus (and canceled)\n\nUpcoming Unannounced Remake\n\nWe already knew that Hangar 13 (which recently released Top Spin 2K25) was making a new entry in the Mafia franchise. Studio General Manager Roman Hladík confirmed as much in August 2022, when the series was celebrating its twentieth anniversary:\n\nI'm happy to confirm we've started work on an all-new Mafia project! While it's a few years away and we can't share anything more right now, we're really excited to keep working on this beloved franchise and to entertain our players with new stories.\n\nThe same goes for BioShock, of course. The new installment in the dystopian first-person shooter franchise was announced in late 2019, and yet Cloud Chamber is still ramping up recruitment for the project. The third project is also interesting. Supermassive Games partnered with 2K Games to make The Quarry, which launched in June 2022 to a very positive (9/10) review here on Wccftech. It looks like they were making another game codenamed Erebus; however, it was eventually canceled, which may explain the studio's massive layoffs of a third of its staff a few months ago.\n\nThe news of the day is, however, the unannounced remake. Given the publisher's big portfolio, it's really hard to even figure out what it could be. Granted, it's not any one of their sports franchises since remaking an annual sports game wouldn't really make any sense.\n\nThat leaves mostly X-COM, Mafia, Civilization, Borderlands, and BioShock. However, Mafia already got a remake for the first game and a remaster of the second game. BioShock also received remasters as part of the trilogy collection. Perhaps Gearbox's next Borderlands game (which had been rumored to be unveiled at Summer Game Fest 2024 but wasn't there after all) is actually a remake of the first one? That one got a remaster, too.\n\nWhatever the case, it's something else to look forward to from 2K Games. We'll keep you apprised on any further rumors and leaks on the project.",

      "# [If Fifa is about to make an EA Sports FC competitor, that’s great news for gamers by Keith Stuart, www.theguardian.com on 2024-05-28](https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/may/28/pushing-buttons-ea-sports-gaming)\nTwo years ago, the long and lucrative relationship between Electronic Arts and Fifa broke down, with EA taking its ball home and launching EA Sports FC, a new brand for its footie sim series. Fifa president Gianni Infantino made a sulky declaration that he would find a new developer and that, “the only authentic, real game that has the Fifa name will be the best one available for gamers and football fans”. This seemed like a ludicrous boast: EA had 20 years of experience making mainstream football sims – an expensive and highly sophisticated endeavour. How could Fifa hope to find a studio capable of competing?\n\nWell, it looks as if the global football body may have found its new best friend. Gaming news sites have been reporting on a tweet by Ghanaian retailer MohPlay, claiming that a deal had been struck with 2K Games to make a new Fifa title – perhaps even for release later this year. The tweet, which has had over 200,000 views, seems to confirm an earlier rumour about a partnership between Fifa and 2K.\n\nIn some ways, it makes sense. Although the American publisher has not developed a modern soccer sim, it has a lot of experience with sports games, via its NBA 2K, NFL 2K, WWE 2K, TopSpin 2K and PGA Tour 2K titles. Furthermore, the latter license was eventually purchased by 2K several years after EA ended its PGA relationship – so the company has form in this area.\n\nBut a new Fifa game this year? That seems unlikely. Even if 2K had begun work as soon as the relationship between EA and Fifa dissolved in May 2022, that was still gave them barely two years to assemble a team, develop the game and create digital likenesses (which would surely include motion capture) of hundreds of players, as well as modelling the stadia.\n\nThe reaction from players has been mixed. Many welcome the idea of competition for the EA series now that Konami’s Pro Evolution Soccer brand is a shadow of its former self. But 2K games has been criticised for overt monetisation within its games especially the NBA series, where players can use real money to buy players for the MyCareer mode.\n\nI’d love to see a strong new independent competitor – something with the knockabout thrills of 2D titles such as Sensible Soccer or Kick Off 2, or a game that recalls the early 3D era of International Super Star Soccer or Virtua Striker. We do have Sociable Soccer, the spiritual successor to the Sensible series, but it would be great to have something completely new; something fun and fast and eccentric. We’ve seen the introduction of idiosyncratic concepts into the golf sim arena with What the Golf and Desert Golfing – surely it’s football’s turn?\n\nCould we perhaps resurrect the idea of semi-turn-based footie games suggested by ZX Spectrum classic Subbuteo? Or maybe bring back the era of football games that were licensed by a single (often retired) pro? We’re long overdue a successor to Chris Kamara’s Street Soccer or Emlyn Hughes International Soccer. Forget the multimillion-dollar tournament licenses and endless micro-transactions – shall we never again see the likes of Peter Shilton’s Handball Maradona?\n\nWhat to play\n\nIf you rightly miss the glory days of humour-tinged resource management games, then Galacticare by Brightrock Games will give you lots of nostalgic pleasure during the summer months.\n\nEssentially Theme Hospital in space, the aim is to build your own hospital able to cater to the health needs of various extraterrestrial patients infested with space parasites, jellied bones and other disgusting ailments. The learning curve is smooth and forgiving, and the cartoonish style emphasises fun over fundamental business practices.\n\nAvailable on: PC, PS5, Xbox\n\nEstimated playtime: 30+ hours\n\nWhat to read\n\nHelldivers 2 is one of the biggest hits of the year, and GamesIndustry.Biz has an interesting interview with its creator, Arrowhead Games. One of the key difficulties the company faces is how to deal with the problems that huge success brings – including the health of its staff. “The big difference now, which is horrifying, is the amount of threats and rude behaviour that people in the studio are getting from some really shitty individuals within the community,” explains CEO Johan Pilestedt. They’re certainly not alone.\n\nAnother interview that caught a lot of attention this week was with Naughty Dog studio head Neil Druckmann, who appeared to tell the Sony website that his next project would “redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming”. He was forced to correct the record, as he was apparently misquoted.\n\nActivision has confirmed that this year’s Call of Duty title will be Black Ops 6 – more details will be revealed at the Xbox Games Showcase on 9 June, with a deep dive stream following afterwards.\n\nI’m reading Playing With Reality: How Games Shape Our World by neuroscientist Kelly Clancy. It’s a fascinating, far-reaching study of the role played by games throughout the history of humanity, from the forgotten medieval game of rithmomachia to modern simulations and online worlds. It’s published on 18 June.\n\nWhat to click\n\nHauntii review – a ghost searches for understanding in the afterlife in this imaginative debut\n\nXDefiant review – Overwatch meets Call of Duty in an Ubisoft theme park\n\nSim-ply unfilmable?

However, isn’t it only a bigger industry because the unit costs per video game is often much higher than the unit costs per film or music album?\n\nFor example, if one million people buy GTA VI for £60 next year, that generates £60m in revenue, but if one million people watch Oppenheimer for £15 per ticket or buy the latest Taylor Swift album for £15, that would generate £15m.\n\nAnd as a video games journalist, do you attach any value to reports about how the video games industry is bigger than the film and music industries?”\n\nAlthough there’s some truth in this, there are a few flaws in your maths. First, for every video game sold, there could be a whole family or friend group playing, so in a fiscal sense, each copy is working extremely hard for that £60m. Also, don’t overlook the huge boom in free-to-play smartphone games, such as Candy Crush or Genshin Impact – according to a range of statistical estimates, there are around 2.5 billion smartphone gamers in the world, many of whom never pay a penny, and certainly not £60.\n\nI have grown to despise how non-specialist news and media outlets refer to global revenue figures every time games are mentioned – something they don’t do with films or music on anywhere near the same regularity. It’s a hopelessly narrow lens through which to view such a bewilderingly diverse art form, and it reduces the cultural value of games to a few money-spinning franchises. I really hope, by the time GTA VI does arrive, that news and arts programmes will find more interesting angles than how much money it’s made for stakeholders.\n\nIf you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

Today, we know it as WWE 2K14 which is undoubtedly the best WWE game ever right next to SmackDown Here Comes The Pain! 2K14 was absolutely filled with stuff to do.\n\nThere were so many game modes and match types to choose from, that you could get lost in the menu for several minutes at a time. Moreover, the story mode \"30 Years of WrestleMania was humongous and had a lot of quality\". It was an amazing feeling to step into this mode and play matches from the 80s and 90s with the classic film grain. The Streak Mode was another excellent addition and allowed you to defend the Undertaker's Streak while playing as him or try and end it by taking him and his demonic AI on in a match.\n\nYou could create your own finishers and even your own stories with the amount of freedom this game allowed. Despite how many hours you put into it, WWE 2K14 always had more for you to check out and that makes it the best wrestling game that 2K has ever made.\n\n2) WWE 2K24\n\nWWE 2K24 takes everything that WWE 2K23 does good and does it better. This game also takes a significant jump in difficulty as reversals are now harder than ever. Moreover, the super aggressive CPU on legendary difficulty provides exactly the kind of challenge that wrestling enthusiasts are looking for with these games. The legendary camera angle from \"Here Comes The Pain!\" is also back in WWE 2K24 and that alone makes matches feel much more impactful.\n\nWith 2K24 the community has become somewhat confident in 2K's ability to make these games. They lost a lot of goodwill for 2K20 but won it all back with 2K22. Now, WWE 2K24 stands at the pinnacle of their current formula.\n\n3) WWE 2K23\n\nWWE 2K23 is a lot similar to WWE 2K19 in terms of how they improved over their predecessors by polishing and fine-tuning the formula to the max. It introduces, MyRise which is an excellent story mode that delivers a ton of fun moments and even your choices feel like they matter which is rare for a sports game.\n\nMoreover, you get to play the Showcase mode featuring John Cena not as the man himself but his opponents which is another fun twist to the gameplay. WWE 2K23 is almost the pinnacle of what a modern day wrestling game should look and feel like, which puts it over WWE 2K19.\n\n4) WWE 2K19\n\nWWE 2K19 succeeded at doing everything that 2K17 and 2K18 tried to do. This was a better game by every measure but all it really was at the bottom was a fine-tuned mixture of functions from WWE 2K17 and 2K18. With this title WWE's 2K series perfected the gameplay formula and delivered on fast and fluid combat. Moreover, the creator was amazing and saw the community coming up with some amazing creations.\n\nAfter years of playing with 2K17 and 2K18's sluggish combat, 2K19 arrived as a breath of fresh air and completely revived the series. Some even considered it to be one of the top two games from 2K.\n\n5) WWE 2K22\n\nWWE 2K22 was the best way to bring the series back after the disaster that was WWE 2K20 . The graphics were a big step-up, the game had way fewer bugs and the combat was the best it had been in a long time. Moreover, the in-game character creator was also massive and provided a lot of depth.\n\nThe MyCareer mode in this title also felt a lot less generic. For the first time, WWE's story mode provided a fun to play experience with a good story mode where it actually felt like your choices mattered. In a nutshell, 2K22 was a huge step in the right direction and an excellent way to revive the franchise after WWE 2K20.\n\n6) WWE 2K16\n\nWWE 2K16 was the perfect way to follow 2K15. The showcase mode was impressive and featured Stone Cold's matches from the Attitude Era. Moreover, the gameplay was fine-tuned to deliver a smoother experience than 2K15. Also worth noting is the fact that 2K16 came out in a much better state than its predecessor.\n\nWhat held this game back is the stamina meter that at times made it feel like some matches would go on for eternities. If it wasn't for the stamina meter this game would be higher up the list.\n\n7) WWE 2K15\n\nWWE 2K15 was the first WWE game to come out on the then next generation of consoles, the PS4 and Xbox One. It marked a significant improvement in graphics and refined the combat a lot. Moreover, 2K15 introduced the fan favorite showcase mode which has now become a staple of the franchise. As far as leaps in quality go, 2K15 hit the mark and is still loved by many making it one of the better games released by 2K.\n\nIf we think about it, 2K15 laid the foundation for everything that is good about the 2K wrestling games today. However, it didn't come without its flaws and could be quite buggy and sluggish at times. 2K15 was rightfully criticized for its extremely slow and sluggish combat, which in turn caused people to not value the step-up in quality.\n\n8) WWE 2K17\n\nWWE 2K17 is by no means a bad game, but it isn't a fantastic game either. This is a title that was a little too bare bones for the people's liking. The fan favorite Showcase mode had been removed and there was nothing added to replace it. Moreover, 2K17 introduced a bunch of new functions like the Promo segments, that were all removed in subsequent entries in the series.\n\nIf WWE 2K17 had a little more time in the oven, it would've done wonders for the quality of this title. Unfortunately, that is not the case, and the game is remembered today as a half-baked entry.\n\n9) WWE 2K Battlegrounds\n\nWWE 2K Battlegrounds feels like a game that was made to merely pass the time, instead of a game that is meant to be timeless. While 2K Battlegrounds delivered a fun gameplay experience, all the microtransactions combined with the lack of creative options made for a pretty sour experience for most players. In the end, the community treated this title as something to pass the time until 2K22 came out.\n\n10) WWE 2K20\n\nThere is absolutely no charm or anything even remotely redeeming about WWE 2K20. The game was absolutely broken at launch and would constantly crash. 2K worked hard to get rid of these bugs through post release patches. Unfortunately, 2K20 was so broken that even patches couldn't save it.\n\nThe only reason anyone even talked about WWE 2K20 after its release is because of how poorly designed it was. The game modes were boring, the combat bland, and you couldn't get through a single session without the game crashing on you. All of this makes this the worst WWE game by 2K.\n\nAlso Read: WWE-Inspired Video Games: Ranking the Best WWE Games of All Time\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",
      "# [The Dr Disrespect fallout continues as YouTube, 2K Games, Turtle Beach, the NFL, and others cut ties with the disgraced streamer by Andy Chalk on 2024-06-27](https://www.yahoo.com/news/dr-disrespect-fallout-continues-youtube-204436732.html)\nThe fallout from Dr Disrespect's admission that his lifetime ban from Twitch was the result of inappropriate communications with a minor continued today with a report that the streamer's name will be removed from NBA 2K24 in a future patch. The pending removal follows similar moves from organizations including Turtle Beach and the San Francisco 49ers, both of which have confirmed that they have ended their relationships with the streamer.\n\nDr Disrespect, real name Guy Beahm, was one of the biggest streamers on Twitch when he was banned from the platform in 2020. The reason for the ban remained unknown until earlier this week: After a former Twitch employee alleged the suspension was the resulting of \"sexting a minor\" through Twitch's Whispers messaging system, Beahm himself confirmed this was the case, although he downplayed the nature of the conversation, describing it as \"casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate, but nothing more.\"\n\nBeahm did not reveal whether he knew the person he was talking to was a minor at the time of their interaction. Regardless, his effort to minimize the situation did not go as he presumably hoped—if anything, it had the opposite effect. The backlash on social media only intensified, and multiple companies have formally ended their relationship with him.\n\nThe first to cut him loose was Midnight Society, the game studio he co-founded in 2021, which announced on June 24 that after an investigation, \"we are terminating our relationship with Guy Beahm immediately.\"\n\nThat actually came one day prior to Beahm's admission, but the dominoes have been falling quickly since then. A series of Dr Disrespect-branded Turtle Beach gaming peripherals, including a headset, keyboard, and mouse, were removed from the company's website; Turtle Beach confirmed in a statement provided to PC Gamer that \"we will not be continuing our partnership with Guy Beahm/DrDisRespect.\"\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League, which began a promotional relationship with Beahm in 2022, has also severed ties, telling SFGate, \"We take these developments seriously and will not be working with him going forward.\"\n\nEarlier today, Dexerto reported that Beahm will also be removed from NBA 2K24 in a future patch. A 2K representative later clarified in a statement to PC Gamer that \"The Dr Disrespect named player animations will be renamed in the next patch in August.\"\n\nThere's not an explicit connection to Beahm's admission of improper communications with a minor, but the website for Black Steel Bourbon, a company Beahm founded in 2022, is also offline.\n\nThe Dr Disrespect Champion's Club website—essentially a place to buy merchandise—has also been scrubbed of content, and now goes directly to a customer service form for order inquiries. The Wayback Machine indicates that all content was present on the site as recently as June 25.\n\nLater in the day, after this story was published, YouTube demonetized Beahm's channel on its platform. \"We have suspended monetization on Dr Disrespect’s channel for violating our Creator Responsibility policy,\" a YouTube representative told PC Gamer. The rep said the channel was demonetized because of the allegations against Beahm, and noted that YouTube's guidelines cover behavior both on and off the platform. Beahm is also prohibited from making new channels to circumvent the demonetization.\n\nBeahm has been silent on the matter since his June 25 statement, in which he admitted to the exchange of messages with a minor in 2017. He also said in that statement that he's \"not fucking going anywhere,\" and that after an extended vacation he's \"coming back with a heavy weight off [his] shoulders.\" But it's clear that despite his insistence that no actual wrongdoing was acknowledged, an awful lot of what he left behind won't be waiting for him when he returns.",

The studio, and publisher 2K Games, revealed Mafia: The Old Country, a new entry that will send the series back to Italy. Mafia: The Old Country promises to “uncover the origins of organized crime” with a “gritty mob story set in the brutal underworld of 1900s Sicily.” Hangar 13 promises the “authentic realism and rich storytelling” the Mafia series is known for. Details are scant, but expect more in December, the game’s makers say — probably at The Game Awards, if we’re guessing.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle\n\nBethesda not only gave us a new look at Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, we also (finally) got a release date: Dec. 9 on Windows PC and Xbox Series X.

More to come at Call of Duty Next.\n\nDying Light: The Beast\n\nTechland revealed a new game in its zombie adventure franchise at Gamescom with Dying Light: The Beast, which the developer describes as a “thrilling standalone zombie adventure set in a tightly-crafted rural region.” Players take on the role of Kyle Crane, who breaks free after years of brutal experiments and seeks revenge.

King of Meat is coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.\n\nDeveloper FuzzyBot announced Lynked: Banner of the Spark at Opening Night Live. It’s an “arcade-inspired co-op adventure that blends hack and slash combat with roguelike and town-building elements.”\n\nLost Records: Bloom & Rage\n\nLife is Strange developer Don’t Nod revealed new gameplay and a release date for its next game, the ’90s-set narrative adventure Lost Records: Bloom & Rage. The episodic game will launch in two parts on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X on Feb. 18 and March 18, 2025.\n\nARC Raiders\n\nEmbark Studios, creator of The Finals, brought its long-delayed shooter ARC Raiders to Gamescom for a re-reveal.

PS5 and Xbox versions are due later.\n\nReanimal\n\nLittle Nightmares developer Tarsier Studios revealed its next game, a terrifying new adventure called Reanimal. Described as a co-op horror adventure game, players take on the roles of brother and sister who “go through hell to rescue their missing friends.” Reanimal is playable solo or in local and online co-op, and it’s coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X.\n\nMonster Hunter Wilds\n\nCapcom showed off more from its impressively open-world new Monster Hunter game at Gamescom ONL, covering the new area the Scarlet Forest, new monster Lala Barina, and Windward Plains apex predator Rey Dau. Monster Hunter Wilds also has some tasty looking meat — increasingly a Capcom specialty.\n\nSid Meier’s Civilization 7\n\nFiraxis Games showed off first gameplay from Sid Meier’s Civilization 7, but the depth of the next Civ will warrant much more than that. Expect gameplay deep dives and interviews from Gamescom throughout the week.

This comes in the wake of EA Sports' split from FIFA, which has left a gap in the market that 2K could potentially fill. Insiders suggest that 2K has the expertise and resources to create a competitive soccer title, especially given its successful track record with sports games like NBA 2K and WWE 2K [(2K Games and FIFA partnership on new soccer game may be brewing, 2024-02-12)](https://www.si.com/videogames/news/2k-games-fifa-soccer-game-hint) [(Rumor: 2K to launch new FIFA game in 2024 after reportedly securing official license, 2024-05-27)](https://gameworldobserver.com/2024/05/27/2k-fifa-license-new-game-fifa-2k25-report).\n\n### Layoffs and Workforce Changes\nDespite its successes, 2K Games has faced challenges, including layoffs at its Visual Concepts studio.

This high-profile representation is expected to enhance the game's appeal and authenticity [(The Official Website of TopSpin 2K25)](https://topspin.2k.com/2k25/).\n\n## Executive Insights\nDavid Ismailer, President of 2K Games, expressed confidence in the upcoming titles, stating, “What the team is looking to accomplish with Civilization VII is nothing short of breathtaking, and we're confident that Firaxis Games has another hit on their hands with Civilization VII” [(Sid Meier's Civilization® VII Coming In 2025, 2024-06-07)](https://newsroom.2k.com/news/sid-meiers-civilizationr-vii-coming-in-2025). This sentiment reflects the company's commitment to innovation and quality in its game development.\n\n## Conclusion\n2K Games continues to be a significant player in the gaming industry, with a robust portfolio of franchises and exciting new titles on the horizon. The potential partnership with FIFA could mark a strategic expansion into the soccer genre, while the upcoming releases of **Civilization VII** and **Borderlands 4** highlight the company's focus on delivering high-quality gaming experiences. However, the recent layoffs indicate that 2K, like many in the industry, must navigate challenges in workforce management amidst a rapidly evolving market. \n\nFor prospective candidates and investors, 2K Games presents a dynamic opportunity, driven by a commitment to innovation and a strong portfolio of beloved franchises."
