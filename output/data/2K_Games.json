Civilization launched with many innovative features that persist in the series to this day.\n\nAssuming the role of one of history's greatest leaders, chosen from a roster of 15, players guided their chosen civilizations from the dawn of recorded history circa 4000 BC all the way to the year 2100, by which time the game predicted that space voyages to Alpha Centauri will be a reality.Â\n\nBeing the first civilization to assemble a spaceship and complete that journey was one of three ways to achieve victory in the original Civilization. Other options included conquering every city belonging to other civilizations, and scoring the most points before the game ends after a predetermined number of turns or upon reaching the year 2100. Multiple paths to victory remain a defining part of what it means to be a Civilization game to this day.\n\nRegardless of which victory type players pursued, every crucial economic, political, and military decision was theirs alone to make. Scientific advancements, wonders of the world, military strength, and population growth were just a few of the factors they had to consider while building an empire to stand the test of time.",

      "# [Want To Know More About The Quarry Horror Game?](https://quarrygame.2k.com/faq/)\nA: The Quarry is an all-new teen-horror narrative game, where every decision shapes your unique story from a tangled web of possibilities. Any character can be the star of the show - or die - before daylight comes. Take control of nine camp counselors and, using your wits in conversation and reflexes during action, do everything you can to steer them away fromâor directly intoâdanger.\n\nA: Yes! The Quarry offers multiple ways for you to experience the fright with friends. You can play the game solo, or with up to seven other companions in local couch co-op with each player controlling a counselor's actions. In addition, The Quarry features an exciting online mode where you and your friends can watch along and vote on key decisions, creating a story shaped by the whole group!\n\nConsole players: Note that online multiplayer is only supported across the same PlayStation/Xbox generations (PS4 to PS4, PS5 to PS5, Xbox One to Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S to Xbox Series X|S). If you buy the Deluxe Edition you'll have access to both previous- and new-generation versions of the game (within the same console family) and can choose which one to launch in order to play with friends.\n\nA: Death Rewind is a retry mechanic that normally unlocks after your first completion of The Quarry. Start the story with three opportunities to reverse a playable character's death, giving you a chance to alter fate and save them in the process. But with only three retries per playthrough, you'll have to decide when someone's life is truly worth saving, and the undoing of one horrible end may lead to another. Choose wisely.\n\nA: Yes. If you own a digital version of The Quarry for PlayStation 4 or Xbox One you can purchase the Digital Upgrade to provide access to the new-gen version within the same console family and entitled to the same Xbox network or PlayStation Network account.\n\nIf you own a physical version of The Quarry for PlayStation 4 you have the option to purchase the PS5 Digital Upgrade if you own a PlayStation 5 with a disc drive. The PlayStation 4 The Quarry disc must be inserted into the PlayStation 5 whenever playing the new-gen digital version of the game.\n\nA: Our goal with Streamer Mode was to provide a simple and streamlined way for players to create content for The Quarry that included music. Due to evolving standards and practices with how licensed music is implemented and tracked across games and content, this wasnât the case at launch and we decided to switch the name to \"Alternate Music\" to better set expectations for our streaming community. We also recommend adding âThe Quarryâ in their video/streaming headline to help avoid any issues.",

Other platforms can be unlinked by visiting the unlink endpoints like [https://accounts.2k.com/auth/nintendo/unlink](https://accounts.2k.com/auth/nintendo/unlink). But it didn't work for gamecenter.

I stopped caring for a while but tried to get it working again. In the past I contacted 2K and Aspyr but only got tips from them. I just got it working again but there was a lot of trial and error as I also used Steam to play as well. Here is a list of things to try (most are listed in the thread in one way or another):\n\n1. Disconnect 2K from all other accounts, steam, epic, google (this is accessible on 2K's site)\n2. Log out of 2K in all Civ VI games (whether steam, switch, PS, Xbox, etc)\n3. Restore purchases (on ios: \"Get More Content\" -> \"Restore Purchases\")\n4. Logging out of your Apple ID (go the \"Settings\" app, click your apple ID name in the top, under \"iCloud\", \"Media & Purchases\", \"Find My\", etc, there should be a \"Sign Out\" option)\n\nNote: Every time you change something, reset the app (not just exiting out, in the Home screen, swiping up and pausing so you see what apps are open and swipe civ vi away). Yes its tedious but changes won't go into affect until you do that (they also say wait 15 min but I'm impatient)\n\nOption 4 is what worked for me most recently. For that though, I logged out, opened Civ and the option to login to 2K was available (the logo turned Red from Grey previously) but you need iCloud in order to connect 2K. So with Civ still open in the background, I logged back in and did not allow my iCloud to merge. Then I reset the app and it was working. I know the iCloud merge is probably not possible for everyone but it was what worked. \n\nIt seems like in order to make this work, you need your ios game to believe this is your only civ/2k account. It's stupid and you would think after years it would be fixed but alas. May your achievements not be deleted and your clouds connect.\n\n## Comment ID ev0wciq with +1 score by [(Nickjrock, Reddit, 2019-07-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/ch8qpi/impossible_to_login_to_2k_account_on_civ_6_ios/ev0wciq/) (in reply to ID ch8qpi):\nSame here\n\n### Comment ID ev0wpiq with +1 score by [(crackofdawn, Reddit, 2019-07-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/ch8qpi/impossible_to_login_to_2k_account_on_civ_6_ios/ev0wpiq/) (in reply to ID ev0wciq):\nI've tried everything.

I was just looking for cloud saves. Found no answers online and the FAQs don't even mention a disabled state for the 2k button.\n\n*Preface:* *I downloaded Civ6 from the respective Apple App Stores (iOS, iPadOS, MacOS). Solution may differ if from Epic or Steam.* \n\n**Game Center:**\n\nFirst and foremost, the connection to Civ6 servers requires Game Center. Without it, you're offline. You need to have GameCenter enabled on your device. When you launch the app, if you see a Game Center notification that you're signed in, then you know you're good here. \n\n**Log In and Link Accounts:**\n\n*(I honestly don't understand the mechanics of this one, or if it's even necessary in addition to Game Center, but I took an overkill approach)* \n\nOn both the native browser (Safari) and the default browser (Chrome for me), sign into your 2k Account. If you haven't already, link your 2k Account anywhere you can (I linked Steam, Epic, and Google). \n\n**Close, Relaunch, Verify:**\n\nThird: Make sure you're logged into all of those linked accounts on your browser(s) (2K, Epic, Steam, Gmail for me). Close / Quit Civ6 completely. Re-launch it. Verify Game Center sign-in message appears. 2k account button (bottom right) should work now. \n\nIf this doesn't work for you, let me know the situation (device, download platform, etc.) and I can offer some troubleshooting advice. \n\n*Thoughts*\n\n*This game was released in 2016, so I will accept that you need to jump through invisible hoops to get this to work if it doesn't work the first time. However, I will not have sympathy for a shotty implementation in Civ7.*",

Hurr hurr.\n\nMy group is mostly interested in 1k games. Quick games that won't take too long for our newbie selves.\n\nSo there are tons of resources on how to play 2k games. How many units you should take. What types of units to fill your army with. How to transport them. When to charge. How you should move across the board. What's best for armies at 2k. Which is fair, it feels like 2k is how 40k was intended to be played.\n\nMy question is are there any resources that can talk about how a 1k game differs? Or failing that, does anyone have any information they've picked up in playing their own games?\n\nThe armies feel as though they have to be wuite different. Some of the best units in some armies are simply too expensive to use in a 1k list. Or you can't take as many units that help them.\n\nHow do you take a good balance of unit types? How do you control the board with less units? How do you take objectives and hold while having to simultaneously take others with fewer units? How does limiting games to 1k change some of the better or worse armies in the game?\n\nThanks very much for any insight you might be able to offer.\n\n\n## Comment ID kwfnbfr with +13 score by [(SaiBowen, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwfnbfr/) (in reply to ID 1bn2yzr):\n1k games sacrifice a lot of balance to be only nominally shorter, imo.\n\nDon't get me wrong, some playstyles jump up playtime dramatically from 1k to 2k, but if you know the rules and you know your army I would guess adding that second 1000points probably comes to less than an hour extra of playtime for the average game.\n\nI recently pushed my group from 1k to 2k and games take 30-40 minutes longer but are way more fun and feel a lot more balanced overall.\n\n### Comment ID kwfqiao with +3 score by [(hypershrew, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwfqiao/) (in reply to ID kwfnbfr):\nYep, people just tend to field more infantry in 1k games and leave the monsters/vehicles at home.\n\n#### Comment ID kwh7y35 with +5 score by [(Squallvash, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwh7y35/) (in reply to ID kwfqiao):\nYou'd think that, but my brother built an all monsters Nids list that was just too hard to deal with overall. \n\nNot really a \"that guy\" move because he was just playing the models he found interesting. \n\nHe's currently playing a list of all Scions and 1 Valkyrie.

It is also typically worth leaning more into smaller units for more flexibility.

Several armies perform really well at lower points where as some just dont have enough to really make an impact.  \n\nFor instance knights should be banned as you arent going to be able to take enough to really do much against them.  I would look to have 300 points of scoring units, 300 of anti-infantry and 300 of anti tank. lists should probably also contain the entire contents of a combat patrol with exception of the characters or considerations made for combat patrols like deathguard and thousand sons.  \n\nEscalation style games are really worth doing where you start with even less points and work your way up to 2k, with jumps of 500 points every few weeks to a month.  Its very easy to fall into the trap of just bring the biggest thing and shoot each other of the table without some some guidelines made in good faith.\n\n## Comment ID kwfr6e8 with +4 score by [(hypershrew, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwfr6e8/) (in reply to ID 1bn2yzr):\n1k points of what?\n\nSounds like a silly question, but a 2k army of knights will take less time to play than a 1k army of tiny infantry squads, all armed with unique weapons and layered buffs and so on. In smaller point games, people tend to be reluctant to bring the more expensive units like monsters or vehicles. Even elites like terminators are less common at that point range, as they’d take up around 20% of your army for just 5 minis. \n\nIn theory, 1k is quicker to play than 2k, but often in practise the difference is negligible. \n\nHowever, it’s up to you and your opponent and what you want to play - if you prefer lots of infantry, then perhaps 1k games will be quicker and more fun for you!\n\n## Comment ID kwgoxgq with +3 score by [(Any_Recognition_3068, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwgoxgq/) (in reply to ID 1bn2yzr):\n1K on the smaller board (30x44”) easily becomes ‘bring your buddies to the center and let’s duke it out”. \n\n1K on the larger board (44x60”) is more interesting to me.\n\n### Comment ID kwgqw9q with +4 score by [(Capital_Tone9386, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwgqw9q/) (in reply to ID kwgoxgq):\nYou'll then be happy to know that the core rules themselves state that 1k games have to be played on a minimum size of 44x60 (the mission packs state the minimal battlefield size for each army size)\n\n#### Comment ID kwgrxuh with +3 score by [(Any_Recognition_3068, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwgrxuh/) (in reply to ID kwgqw9q):\nAh, I was under the impression that it was the smaller board.\n\nWas it different in 9th?\n\n## Comment ID kwj01nt with +3 score by [(Consistent-Brother12, Reddit, 2024-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1bn2yzr/major_differences_between_1k_and_2k_games/kwj01nt/) (in reply to ID 1bn2yzr):\nThe big difference I've found between 1k and 2k games is that because resource management is such a big aspect of the game, losing a unit makes a much bigger impact and decisions have to be made a bit more carefully.

I think if sub 2k it's critical to find a nice rule 0 set to play with so that no one is overpowering the board really... honestly I've given it some thought and 1k games are fine with people that are more wanting a balanced game but 2k is the goto especially with new people or playing the game at a balanced point.

Its not people randomly hating. The new numbered edition is always legitimately a worse game than the previous one, on release. They're always extremely poorly optimized as well.\n\nEvery single release of Civ releases half-baked, buggy, and without half of the features the previous edition had.\n\nThey then replace some of those missing features with the first expansion, and then finish most of the rest with the last expansion, finally making Civ N a more complete game with more features than Civ N-1 had. Tack on some pseudo-countries and pseudo-leaders, and you've got the most complete version of the game, Civ N.\n\nThen years later, they release Civ N+1, which is the same as Civ N but with some core mechanic changed and half of the features missing.\n\n\nThis is the only way the business model works, since there just aren't that many new things to tack on to justify a full N+1th new version of the game. But there are still some features in Civ 4 that are absent from Civ 6, namely sufficient modding support, vassalization, and corporations.\n\nI didn't play 6 much because the scenarios were garbage in comparison to 5. But the ability to overhaul the game into a completely different form has been gone since 4, and I don't expect it to return.\n\n#### Comment ID l7l8rg6 with +1 score by [(Mr-Mister, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1da95r5/civilization_vii_banner_appears_on_2k_games/l7l8rg6/) (in reply to ID l7iudh3):\nYou're forgetting how a few years after the game's release an update introduces a bug where if the game has more that a certain numbers of entities (not just loaded at once, but, in layman's terms, in its database) then it crashes, and that greatly limits the number of mods you can use concurrenrtly.\n\n#### Comment ID l7j486p with +1 score by [(PacoTaco321, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1da95r5/civilization_vii_banner_appears_on_2k_games/l7j486p/) (in reply to ID l7iudh3):\nIf it doesn't look like a mobile game, then it's fine.\n\n### Comment ID l7iqxnt with +7 score by [(cslack30, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1da95r5/civilization_vii_banner_appears_on_2k_games/l7iqxnt/) (in reply to ID l7io8lz):\nHaven’t a lot of devs left firaxis recently?

I am a huge 4X fan and I don’t think I have ever played one where the AI felt genuinely intelligent. There are just way too many decisions and elements to consider a competent human player will always be able to outperform an AI which is why they always are allowed to cheat on higher difficulties\n\n#### Comment ID l7jsmj6 with +40 score by [(monkwren, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1da95r5/civilization_vii_banner_appears_on_2k_games/l7jsmj6/) (in reply to ID l7jlt4t):\nAnd when you do start making an AI that makes more human-like decisions, people dislike it.

Part of the fun is learning the patterns of the AI and successfully predicting them, and when computers don't act like computers, the only psychologically safe assumption is that they must have accessed information they shouldn't have. AI isn't allowed to gamble, or behave randomly, or get lucky-even though humans do all of these things on a daily basis- not because we can't program it, but because experience tells us that players will get frustrated and quit, The same phenomenon doesn't happen when both opponents are humans, because they've already tempered their expectations for the possibility that the other guy is crazy. computers are too smart to be crazy, so if they start acting that way, we can't shake the suspicion that they know something we don't. Thus, from the designer's perspective, brilliant AI is usually not our highest priority.\n\n#### Comment ID l7jrtia with +3 score by [(TheNimbleKindle, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1da95r5/civilization_vii_banner_appears_on_2k_games/l7jrtia/) (in reply to ID l7jlt4t):\nI am sure that it's very difficult otherwise they would have fixed it.

If the AI plays to win, then the roleplayers get mad that the AI does things like declare war even though you were friends for the last 150 turns. If the AI caters to roleplayers, then the AI becomes more exploitable and it won't make the best choice if it breaks the illusion.\n\nIt's not really possible to cater fully to both sides.

I started Civ as a middle schooler with the OG one and it was always one of my favorites. I began falling off Civ when I discovered CK2 and EUIV and it scratched my historical itch with a deeper sim. \n\nI still really like the Civ formula, but I didn’t enjoy Civ 6 leaders and their ambitions. It’s cool that leaders had certain strategic playstyles, but the AI just kind of felt really dumb. I wouldn’t mind something that goes a bit deeper into resources and economies and internal politics and populations. Doesn’t need to be incredibly, but more mechanics and more reason to feel real difference in government and society would be fun. Also something that makes the really slow and boring combat more enjoyable would be nice.\n\n#### Comment ID l7jkhi4 with +2 score by [(PalmTreeIsBestTree, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1da95r5/civilization_vii_banner_appears_on_2k_games/l7jkhi4/) (in reply to ID l7j1w37):\nI just want them to bring back some of the mechanics of 4 into the game.

In 6 however they basically axed this because of how strong district adjacency bonuses are, meaning you had to build way more cities so that your districts could stack insane bonuses by being next to each other or places of interest on the map.

It’s an exciting idea with lots of potential, and I wanted to share my thoughts and see what you all think!\n\n\n\n1. Expanded Game Library for Xbox: With 2K Games under Microsoft's wing, Xbox would gain access to some incredible franchises like \\*NBA 2K, Borderlands, and XCOM. This could significantly boost the value of Game Pass and provide Xbox players with a broader selection of high-quality games.\n\n\n\n2. Enhanced Cross-Platform Experiences: Integrating 2K’s games with Xbox’s ecosystem could lead to enhanced cross-platform play and exclusive content. Imagine exclusive events or features tied to Xbox that would further enrich the gaming experience.\n\n\n\n3. Revitalizing Classic Titles: One exciting possibility is remaking classic games, and I think a reimagining of \\*The Darkness\\* would be awe inspiring. Picture this: The Darkness completely rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 with an upgraded story and expanded darkness powers. The potential for a modern take on this game could be incredible, offering both nostalgic fans and new players a fresh experience.\n\n\n\n4. Strengthened Xbox Game Studios: Acquiring 2K could bolster Microsoft’s game development capabilities and lead to new collaborations and innovations within the Xbox ecosystem.\n\n\n\nWhat do you all think? Would acquiring 2K Games be a game-changer for Xbox? And how would you feel about a reimagined The Darkness with cutting-edge technology and a revamped story?\n\n\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\n## Comment ID lg60ldx with +60 score by [(despitegirls, Reddit, 2024-08-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1eieskr/imagine_microsoft_acquiring_2k_games/lg60ldx/) (in reply to ID 1eieskr):\nhttps://preview.redd.it/86po36s87agd1.jpeg?width=508&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=edb1b0a1c63b8c95b6894d005ca557a1298aedaa\n\n## Comment ID lg5y4a7 with +37 score by [(Leather-Mobile-8370, Reddit, 2024-08-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1eieskr/imagine_microsoft_acquiring_2k_games/lg5y4a7/) (in reply to ID 1eieskr):\nNo.\n\n## Comment ID lg611dx with +32 score by [(matty-phantoms, Reddit, 2024-08-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1eieskr/imagine_microsoft_acquiring_2k_games/lg611dx/) (in reply to ID 1eieskr):\nNot a single person should be hoping Microsoft acquires anyone else.\n\n### Comment ID lg6l0im with +2 score by [(dennarai17, Reddit, 2024-08-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1eieskr/imagine_microsoft_acquiring_2k_games/lg6l0im/) (in reply to ID lg611dx):\nMicrosoft already fucks up all the studios they currently have.

It doesn't even make sense as the games won't be exclusive, they would still put them on PlayStation etc, so it would just be to put the games on Gamepass, but Gamepass day 1s may not even last for that long, or they price people out of Gamepass ultimate.\n\nActivision has all the things that you listed, yet I don't think Xbox will really look to remake old games, unless someone asks to, which is unlikely.\n\nIf you own all the studios under Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda, and Activision and still can't produce quality games there is an issue within Xbox, Xbox doesn't need to be bigger\n\n## Comment ID lg68240 with +3 score by [(Plutuserix, Reddit, 2024-08-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1eieskr/imagine_microsoft_acquiring_2k_games/lg68240/) (in reply to ID 1eieskr):\nNo, thanks.

I have enough Microtransactions in my Xbox games, thank you very much. \n\nThere's only two companies I can make sense of Microsoft buying anyone for entertainment growth. 1, would be WB and I wouldn't be totally against that because they're already dying under Discovery (even though they're supposed to be equal). WB would give them only a bit more as a gaming company (WB Games) but would largely be a new venture into media entertainment outside of gaming with comics, movies/TV, etc. I'm the modern age it'd help them compete with the likes of Amazon and Apple doing the same and at this rate Microsoft wouldn't much be able to starting their own tv/movie production studios (though that'd also be interesting). Worst case scenario they kill off WB sooner which rips the bandaid off. And then maybe an eastern publisher which might be more like ​inevitable if they want to continue growing. There's so much conflicting rumors around why Tango might have been closed, but one suggestion is that they are too far from the rest of the studios across Microsoft Gaming making collaboration as a smaller AA studio difficult. Microsoft is going to need a strong presence in the east to actually grow there and that'd mean at the very least heavily partnering more with eastern gaming companies (which granted we see right now so that might be the route they take). \n\nSomething to keep in mind is that Microsoft didn't approach ABK. As far as I know they didn't approach Zenimax either. I don't think either sides of the argument on gamers end (consolidation being good or bad) really recognize what it represents. It's a sign of the industry shrinking. When that happens companies either downsize themselves, cease entirely, or get gobbled up (which will lead to some natural downsizing on top of the inevitable bit), which is what we saw with ABK and Zenimax. The executives there just didn't see any more growth in gaming on their own for their companies and instead they saw rather turmultous times (which we are in). Selling to Microsoft was them cashing out. They thought they made as much as they could and were done. People get angry at the idea a business always has to grow, but I mean it does. If it's not growing then eventually it will start losing money so those businesses that think they've peaked find some way to cash out (much like you would if you think a stock has grown as much as it will or if you're satisfied with its growth). Microsoft on the other hand saw opportunity when approached by those companies (or saw opportunity in approaching them). They too recognized the industry is in a downturn but thought they could make the most of it (which they did; I mean at a time where growth in the console market is flat and Xbox being third place sees slight overall decline, they skyrocketed growth). \n\nThere's various moral and post economic factors about how everyone as an individual might view consolidation, but it's important to keep in mind on the business end why it happens in the first place. Microsoft doesn't actually stand to benefit business wise buy purchasing everyone under the sun. It costs money to acquire a company and then they foot the bill for literally everything to do with that company after AND have to go through massive lengthy restructures (Zenimax still isn't done). A lot of benefits they'd get from purchasing they can get through deals and partnerships at less money with less risk. Companies themselves also might not see any real reason to try to be acquired or want it if offered. 2k Games is a subsidiary of Take Two and Take Two still has SO much room to grow and a long time before they're losing money consistently even in the current landscape. \n\nAt this point Microsoft wouldn't even benefit much themselves buying any other gaming publishers. Again I could see one to propel them into other mediums of entertainment especially as video game content IP rises in popularity or one to expand globally, but like jut 2k games or take two? None of what you said requires spending billions and paying overhead for either? Take Two can take advantage of Xbox Play Anywhere at any time. Take two also (unlike ABK ever did) supports Game Pass pretty okay and don't do many exclusives (unlike Bethesda had begun to with PS). There's no guarantee or bringing up old titles and again that doesn't require an acquisition. I don't think anyone would want that on the business or consumer end\n\n### Comment ID lgpxu1f with +1 score by [(Jaronwheeler, Reddit, 2024-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1eieskr/imagine_microsoft_acquiring_2k_games/lgpxu1f/) (in reply to ID lgke4oz):\nThe idea of Microsoft buying WB for movies and TV is cool, but I think they should focus on games first. 2K Games could really help make Xbox better with all the popular titles they have.

(To be honest, I've been the one pushing the points up because I've got the most experience so far out of our group with 10th specifically and want to try some bigger lists.)\n\nIn 9th, my group found our sweet spot to be right around 1.5k. Big enough to bring some fun models, but time conscious. We're also solidly in the beerhammer category though so games typically take longer than they should, lol. We're all pretty veteran players with plenty of models, we just found 1.5k to be the most fun in 9th in time and pacing. Not sure how 10th will shake out.

I’ve recently moved towns and joined a very chill club, so chill that a lot of the time is spent nattering and going to see pivotal points of other games so often turn 3 was a mythical and rarely seen event at 1500pts let alone 2k. (Very different to my previous clubs where a 2k game could be hashed out in under an hour and a half) as such the whole club decided to move to 1000pts and honestly it’s great. \n\nIt’s a really fun point level because even if someone brings a mega combo of doom it doesn’t have the support it needs to actually win, so it has led to more varied and interesting lists as you can’t bring every tool you would at 2k.

The feel of some armies at 1k vs 2k is drastically different, especially because you're less likely to see as many vehicles, high damage weaponry or high amounts of infantry as compared to something like a 2k game. You have to bring only what you can't live without at 1k where at 2k you're offered a bit more wiggle room to work on things like synergies.\n\n## Comment ID k1r0ca3 with +1 score by [(APhysicistAbroad, Reddit, 2023-09-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/16or6p8/does_anyone_ever_play_less_than_2k_games/k1r0ca3/) (in reply to ID 16or6p8):\n2k is a special big game for me and my bud.

Progressing your MyPlayer is horrible because it takes forever and the VC(currency to upgrade your player which can also be bought with money) greed is out of control. So there is a good chance 2K would push this MyPlayer concept with all the VC bs in a fifa game too. So players who are interested in a MyPlayer fifa version are doomed and will probably have a horrible experience. So that is where all the hate is coming from and rightfully so.\n\nWith that being said, outside of that the NBA 2K games are very very good in my opinion. People who are playing the Franchise Mode (MyNBA Mode) to have a realistic and immersive  Basketball experience and taking advantage of the huge amount of the customization the game allows to create your own nba universe or replay through past eras  usually enjoy the game very much. Also the Player Lock setting lets you have a infinitely better version of MyCareer, most people just dont know about it and therefore never gave it a try. You wont even get many opinions on the offline modes because 2K somehow managed to make the majority of people only care about the shitty online VC modes and ignoring the fantastic offline Franchise modes the game has to offer.\n\nSo while 2K is very capable of creating an amazing manager Mode im not sure they can do the same with fifa. The nba is much much smaller in scale when it comes to the amount of stadiums, teams, League, Player database, historic players etc than football.\n\n### Comment ID l786xff with +1 score by [(SnooCookies4806, Reddit, 2024-06-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FifaCareers/comments/1d8n5pr/what_does_a_potential_2k_game_mean_for_us_career/l786xff/) (in reply to ID l77lq3h):\nGreat points!

This caused EA to actually put some effort into the series once again resulting in FIFA ultimately overtaking PES around 2010s and driving it to the ground. And it's been downward spiral for FIFA ever since Konami switched to eFootball or whatever that mess is. Having a new player on the market hopefully is going to bring back the same level of competition. It's always better to have two games that are consistently competing with each other over the same market then one mediocre monopolist.",

Do not expect anything from 2k that you haven’t gotten from EAFC. \n\nThere’s a few different things that 2k does but it makes the game just as miserable. \n\n1. There’s always, of course, full meta, for example heighth which is just as important as pace in EAFC\n\n2. You thought pack odds in EAFC are bad? lol, wait until you get <1% on every pack for super rare cards, they don’t even tell you the odds, one guy spent about $2.5k to get a rare card from the drop, live on stream. Packs cost just as much if not more.\n\n3. Gameplay is consistant. _That doesn’t mean it’s good_, but it is consistant, you learn which animations are going to happen (at least with their engine), randomness factor still exists (but not as much as there is in eafc).\n\n4. It’s barely playable on PC. 2k on PC is full of cheaters, using algorhytms etc. to green time their shots, modding their players to be 5m tall etc. so I hope that FIFA takes care of the PC side of the game.\n\n5. They don’t do menu grinding and SBCs but I reckon FIFA is going to implement that, they have a Card Collection sort of thing where you get rewards based on how many items have you collected (for example you get Icon Zico for 1k players collected etc.)\n\n6. 2k has an ‘amazing’ MyCareer mod though, much better than you’ve seen in EAFC, including co-op with other people and parks, since the most of the player base is playing that game mode and not the MyTeam (FUT).\n\n7. Expect just as much toxicity (even more if they somehow manage to enable voice chat)\n\n## Comment ID lb83yg0 with +1 score by [(notxbatman, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fut/comments/1as9i3p/whoever_has_plays_2k_games_how_are_they_really_is/lb83yg0/) (in reply to ID 1as9i3p):\nThe gameplay itself in 2K games are generally good and in some cases better than EA, but MTX absolutely infest the single player to the point where you genuinely consider buying VC so that you can get more than 2 minutes of court time being a \\~50ovr in a league of 90s.\n\n## Comment ID kqoul2e with +1 score by [(GuyIncognito211, Reddit, 2024-02-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fut/comments/1as9i3p/whoever_has_plays_2k_games_how_are_they_really_is/kqoul2e/) (in reply to ID 1as9i3p):\n2K are basically everything people hate about EA but amplified x 1000\n\n## Comment ID kqoup2k with +1 score by [(LKMarleigh, Reddit, 2024-02-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fut/comments/1as9i3p/whoever_has_plays_2k_games_how_are_they_really_is/kqoup2k/) (in reply to ID 1as9i3p):\nToday 2k are releasing a 100 rated card, which can only be packed, they have no player market, the card is way ahead of the power curve, and pack odds are terrible\n\n### Comment ID kqoxqqz with +2 score by [(Own-Bandicoot6348, Reddit, 2024-02-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fut/comments/1as9i3p/whoever_has_plays_2k_games_how_are_they_really_is/kqoxqqz/) (in reply to ID kqoup2k):\nThey will surely open a market feature.

I've done RTTs with 3 hour rounds that include set up. Some tournaments do 2:30 rounds. It requires both players to be very efficient with decisions and to know their rules very well. Very little looking rules or stats up. Having all your tools readily available. Thinking about what you're going to do while your opponent goes so you immediately start taking actions on your turn.

Serious question.  What do you find is the biggest timesink?  I've never heard of games lasting 8+ hours, even games between new players who don't know all the rules.\n\nMy early games were probably 3-5 hours depending on how quickly I got destroyed.  My casual games now are more in the 2-3 hour range.\n\nFor tournament games, I speed up the process by thinking a lot of things through before I even arrive, having a checklist written out, not talking as much as usual (in casual games I usually think out loud when it comes to my decision processes, give my opponent tips if they're struggling to decide what to do, just generally converse, etc.). \n\nAnd lastly, skip things that won't be impactful.  When shooting a Redemptor, open with the big guns to see if the target dies just from that.  Usually skip the storm bolters unless 1 wound could make all the difference.  Or if a unit of 20 Boyz charges 2 scouts, I just pick up my scouts.  Not worth the time to roll it out when the outcome is 99% determined.\n\nThose kinds of things can get a game down to 90-120 minutes (as long as your opponent is moving equally efficiently).  Chess clocks are kind of necessary to ensure neither player hogs all the time.\n\n### Comment ID l6y6mxh with +3 score by [(the-strange-ninja, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6y6mxh/) (in reply to ID l6x5l8m):\nAdding onto this, skipping some shooting if you know they won’t do much is helpful as well. I had 2 units of legionaries trying to take out a wave serpent on an objective yesterday. Skipped all of the pistol shots and just charged it. Killed it and saved quite a few mins on those shooting rolls.\n\nThat is also to say, efficient decision making include target selection. If you know which of your guns are worth shooting into different units, not only will it save you time on wasted rounds of shooting, but it will also kill your opponent faster.\n\n### Comment ID l6yhb9q with +2 score by [(tiptopjank, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6yhb9q/) (in reply to ID l6x5l8m):\nDoes it significantly quicken the game to play 1k or 1500?\n\n#### Comment ID l6yjbpx with +3 score by [(blacknight302, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6yjbpx/) (in reply to ID l6yhb9q):\nYup!

With chess clocks you have 1:15 to do all your stuff in a game (including saves during your opponent's turn).\n\n\nHonestly, start with smaller games if it's taking 7 hours at 2000 points. I'm assuming that's a lot of time looking up rules and strategems not even including the extra breaks needed for playing that long.\n\nPlay a game at 500 points. Remember to play on a smaller table at this level and use the core of your 2000 point list so you can get familiar with their rules and strategems that effect them. Really, play a few games with no strategems including rerolls and see how that goes. Then bring them back, then move up to 750, 1000ish,  1500ish,  and then 2000 until your casual games are coming in about 4 hours or so. Play these games with simple deployment, no secondary missions, and generous line of sight blocking.  Add  those in as you progress \n\nLook up \"Fast Rolling\" if you're not already batching up dice rolls for units with the same weapons. Get a box of 36 dice and put piles of 5 dice in front of you to make counting out large amounts of dice easier. Use a dice tray/box to keep dice together.\n\nGet some \"red sticks\" or a gaming ruler  for measuring common distances.  Work on recognizing when you just need to measure what matters (a model has 12\" movement but you're only moving it 6\", a gun can fire 24\" but it's target is obviously closer).\n\n## Comment ID l6xlf9s with +19 score by [(t0matit0, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6xlf9s/) (in reply to ID 1d75yqn):\nIdk how people play 2k in under 3hrs, it takes me closer to 4.\n\n### Comment ID l6yfm5q with +6 score by [(Frixinator, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6yfm5q/) (in reply to ID l6xlf9s):\nDo you need to look up datasheets?

Note that this includes setup, introduction of forces, and deployment.\n\nIn a casual game you're likely horsing around, joking, talking to other friends when they walk into the game store. If you're taking over 7 hours you're also probably breaking for food, getting drinks, that sort of thing. In tournament you're probably giving most of your attention to the game. You might still joke with your opponent, but if you're taking too long most tournaments require the use of chess clocks if a player requests one. Once your time runs out, you can only take required actions like rolling saves.\n\nThe #1 eater of clocks for new and casual players is analysis paralysis. \"Where should this unit move, where do I shoot, should I charge, should I CP reroll that?\". Even if it feels like you're only thinking for a couple of minutes, it's often longer than it feels and that time can compound very quickly. Tournament players will often have their first couple of turns planned out (move these units out to objectives, everything else stages for the next turn), will be quick with target identification (I am playing mostly Infantry so I don't really care about those Lascannon Havoks), and will have a game plan for what strats they're going to use the most over the course of the game. CP Reroll usually doesn't matter. They also use the time in their opponent's turn by planning out their next turns. Even if your gameplan falls apart due to poor saves or something, recovering and adapting will take significantly less time than trying to come up with a plan for each turn from scratch every turn.\n\nSomething else that really helps is playing by intent. You openly announce what you're doing and why, then do not have to precisely measure everything with perfect pinpoint accuracy. For example, there's a trick where you place your unit just outside of 1 inch from a Ruin wall, which will force the opponent (assuming they are on 28mm bases or larger) to go all the way around the wall in order to complete a charge, and can limit what of theirs actually gets into engagement range and therefore what gets to fight. You COULD take 10 minutes measuring every single model to be the actual perfect distance, or you could play by intent and get them close enough, and simply inform your opponent this is what you are doing. It is important to note that you should do this while you are actually moving the unit, and not announcing it in their Charge phase because you realized you didn't do it and ate a charge. It's a tool for more fluid, faster games, not Ctrl+Z for mistakes. Another example for movement, you can say \"I want to move this unit here, but I don't want to be visible to that tank\". As long as you have the movement to do so and your opponent agrees you do, you can just get close enough instead of walking around the table and bending over the tank to triple-check that you won't take an Overwatch.\n\nSome other tips include: \n\n* Knowing your rules and relevant FAQs. I like to keep a cheat sheet on me, and I print up enough for my opponents when I go to an event so they can quickly reference my stats and rules. I also recommend putting bookmarks in your codex, and marking Rules sections you commonly refer to as a Favorite in the app so you can pull it up quickly. Looking things up and figuring out how to deal with an overlapping of rules is most likely the biggest eater of your time outside of analysis paralysis. The Core Rule Book recommends rolling to see who decides what happens if you can't figure it out in a timely manner, and since you're playing casually I would agree with doing that, then looking up the actual interaction/ruling later. The Competitive Warhammer subreddit has a pinned thread specifically for asking rules questions and clarifications. Heck, even in tournament sometimes a judge can get a ruling wrong. 40k is a complicated game.\n\n* Roll faster by keeping up with your opponent. When they announce they're attacking you with 10 chainswords, pick up 10 dice, then discard/add to that handful as they miss/get Sustained Hits. By the time you get to the stage you're rolling your saves, you should have roughly the number you need and can roll more quickly instead of taking that time right then to count out your dice.\n\n* In a related vein, keep your dice in easily counted groups. If your dice are sorted to one side in groups of 4, you can very quickly and easily grab what you need instead of reaching into your dice bag to count them out.\n\n* Do not shoot weapons that don't matter. Your Gants might shave a wound off a Land Raider, but most of the time it will make no difference and you will have suceeded in spending 5 minutes rolling to not change the game state. Similarly, know when to not bother rolling at all. If a unit of BT Bladeguard declares their attacks against a unit of 4 Gants, just remove them. Does this deny a model the chance for a cinematic and heroic last stand? Yes, but the chances of that are extremely remote to begin with, and likely would make no difference to the game anyway.\n\n* I see others advocating for movement trays. Do not use movement trays. The easy way to move large blobs of models is to move the front models, then the back models, and simply fill in the middle. If you have a block of models like I see in your picture, you could even just measure the corner models then fill in the rest.\n\n* Speaking of your picture, I see small wooden(?) markers that I can only assume are the Objectives. I recommend sourcing neoprene Objective markers, which will mark the objective itself and the area around it you have to be in to control it so you don't have to measure 3 inches out to see who controls what. Footprints for your ruins can also help by making it clear what is indide a Ruin and what isn't, and would allow you to move the physical wall out of the way to better measure movement through it.\n\nEDIT: Bullet point formatting borked.\n\n### Comment ID l6ybz1a with +1 score by [(Dawson_VanderBeard, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6ybz1a/) (in reply to ID l6y1j34):\ni'll make the case for super dense movement trays for the horde of models (that are basically a big wound counter) and then use 4-5 models as pickets that represent the edges of the blob. might take a bit more opponent cooperation because of coherency and RAW\n\n#### Comment ID l6yfp61 with +1 score by [(AsherSmasher, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6yfp61/) (in reply to ID l6ybz1a):\nThat will run you into issues if you ever want to do something like moving partially through a wall (how many are on either side), and could cause issues with LoS, coherency, and wargear placement.

If it's looking up or discussing rules, then just keep playing, you'll get better at it.\n\nIf you spend most of the time thinking where to move etc, then play with a chess clock. We play with 120min for each player, starting with deployment, so army explanation, mission draw and setup is not in that time included.\n\nWe finish almost every game in time. Sure, we make some mistakes because we are under time pressure, but that's for both players so it's even.

I've seen Tau players do that for the index CIB Crisis death brick for example.\n\nThere will also be instances playing a horde army where you just don't activate some things because they aren't worth the time - your army will generally win by standing places, not killing things. As such, you *may* choose not to bother shooting termagants at a stompa or bolters at a land raider depending on the time and game state.\n\nEdit: for what it's worth, when I started playing again a few years ago, 2k took maybe 5/6 hours. 2.45 is a comfortable pace now.\n\n## Comment ID l6z4d8u with +1 score by [(GodzillaMilk69, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6z4d8u/) (in reply to ID 1d75yqn):\nDude bro please get movement trace it’ll make your games go half as fast\n\n### Comment ID l6z9oa2 with +1 score by [(ducksbyob, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6z9oa2/) (in reply to ID l6z4d8u):\nWhat is movement trace,\n\n#### Comment ID l6za016 with +1 score by [(GodzillaMilk69, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l6za016/) (in reply to ID l6z9oa2):\nMovement trays, my bad.

It's not that we don't allow rolls like that to be made, it's just in this instance shooting with boys usually doesn't result in a single kill unless I get lucky against most of my buddies armies and the time it takes to do those rolls adds up quick when you have 60ish boys on the table, all to usually end up accomplishing very little/not even killing something. It also helps to not be to big of a stickler for measurements / line of sight at times, especially if you guys are decent at eyeballing it IE if me or my friends are making a move that's shorter then the movement range and we know it we usually just tell the other to not worry about measuring (IE unit is moving the last few inches to objective and they can clearly make it there with movement left over.

This lets you do 3 rounds in a tournament, and get in an hour lunch for a total of 9 ish hours (10 minutes between rounds). This is often not enough time for everyone to finish their games, however, so the scores end up reflecting that in a lot of cases. You might have a 3 round game with final scores at like 24-30 or something real low like that. The important thing for playing in a tournament, if that's what you're concerned about, is to learn what parts of the game really deserve your attention. Don't worry about taking every possible shot in the first round, just move and line up the important things.\n\n## Comment ID l701h0y with +1 score by [(BrotherCaptainLurker, Reddit, 2024-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l701h0y/) (in reply to ID 1d75yqn):\nAnywhere from 2-5 hours lol.\n\nAt an actual tournament sometimes a successful alpha strike all but decides the game by turn 2 and you call it and grab lunch or run off to some social/family obligation after 90 minutes. Even if it doesn't go that way, if you cut out socialization and robotically declare intent and roll dice you can consistently knock out games in about 3 hours. (Tournament games regularly end at the bottom of turn 3/4 because they start a 2 hour and 50 minute clock the milisecond pairings are posted and then use player placed terrain though :/.) If you're chatting with your real life friend and drinking and discussing how turns could have gone differently, it rapidly becomes an all-night affair to finish a game.\n\nAs for \"why are my games slow,\" when you have a huge amount of models the turns don't scale the same - normally both players have lost so much stuff by the end of turn 3 that turns 4 and 5 go much more quickly as you both take a few calculated risks to grab points and pass, but when you drop 100 dudes on the table, there are still 50 dudes to roll dice for when half your army is gone lol, plus horde units are usually somewhat weak so the other player still has a combat effective army to continue trying to kill you off of objectives with.\n\nThere's also the textbook answer; the game takes twice as long when you have to actually reference your rules. Once you're settled in with your army list of choice you know all the datasheets and relevant stratagems by heart, so you just say what you want to do and what the effect/profile is.\n\n## Comment ID l7023na with +1 score by [(lowqualitylizard, Reddit, 2024-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l7023na/) (in reply to ID 1d75yqn):\nTwo and a half hours\n\nBut those people most likely no their rules the best because they have to.

Last weekend, I managed to finish all 3 of my games under 2 hours, even tho I was the TO :D Friendly and practice games take usually 4 hours.\n\nFrom the tournament standpoint, I did everything to reduce time wasted on logistics or administration. Tables are numbered and easily found. Terrain is already set up and is the same for all 3 games. There is 15 minutes between announcing the pairings and the start of the round, so everyone has time to find their opponent, transport their armies to the table, take a quick smoke/leak/drink or whatever. We also supply trays to make it easier to transport armies.\n\nFrom my years as a player and TO these are my \"findings\" what are the time wasters:\n\n**Administration**: read the mission pack, know what missions you are playing. If possible, read the lists once they are published, to cut down time explaining army lists. Use an app to track your points (set up all the games in advance). Use a dice rolling app if you play hordes. Only have the stuff you need for the army. Like only bring the datasheets you use, leave the rest at home. Use a compact and informative army list. Have a cheat sheet to reference your rules/profiles if you don't know them by heart.  You'd be surprised how much time is wasted by constantly leafing through codexes or those horrendous Army Builder lists (sooo. much. waste. of. paper...)\n\n**Logistics**: Sooner or later you will realize, that you need proper logistical solutions. Which in my experience is some variation of magnetized carry case. Yeah, wrapping stuff in tissues and putting them in boxes might be cheaper, but the constant taking out and putting away, and the space all that stuff takes up wastes time. Also even in proper foam, stuff constantly breaks. Trying to find glue and glueing your minis back together is another time waster. And some people never learn. So have a magnetic carry case and put your miniatures on trays. I even seen people to come to tournaments with those troleys you see in cantinas :D For horde armies, movement trays are recomended.\n\n**Tools/accessories/dice:** This may sound like a no brainer, but you'd be surprised. Have a working and proper tape measure. Laser pointer, Measuring sticks, like 9\" for deep strikes, 3\", etc. Tokens and markers for buffs. *Have. Enough. Dice!* I cannot stress enough that having the right amount and variety of dice is crucial. It's annoying when people roll up to a tournament with 20 dice or even worse and odd number :D Have separate dice for wound markers and command points, so you don't pick them up by mistake. Have at least 2, but 3 different colored dice, so you can roll multiple profiles together and have at least 40 of one of them. If you are not good at recognizing things, use clear dice. No shame in using numbered dice, instead of dots. Also there are a lot of cool looking dice, but when you have to pick out 1s and 2s from a pile of 60 then it get's hard with all the patterns and type of markings. Also use dice trays. Also you may know your own dice, and you are good at recognizing the patterns, but your oppoenent may not and them constantly stopping you to look at your dice is again a time waster.\n\n**Unit markings:** Espacially in horde armies, but even if you spam the same units, it helps if you can easily differentiate which unit is which. \n\n**Know the Core rules:** This may be the most annoying, because 95% of the rules question I receive during a tournament is explaining core rules. How ruins work. How engagement range works. How cover saves work with 3+ saves. Etc. If you know the core rules, 95% of the so called \"rules disputes\" don't arise to begin with.\n\n**Know your own rules** or at least have a cheat sheet at hand. Having to refference the same rules again and again takes time. So either learn your army rules and unit stats or have a clear cheat sheet/reference. Datacards and stratagem cards are quite handy :)\n\n**It's a tournament:** you are there to play and have fun, but it's a tournament. You won't have time to look at other tables, there is no time for small talk and tell stories. If you can multitask, you can talk while you are doing things. If you are not good at multitasking, no one will be mad at you if you focus on your little toy soldiers. Be there physically but also mentally. If you need a smoke break, do that during your opponents movement turn, not when it's your turn. Stand up to your jealous girlfriend who pesters you for constant status updates to leave you some peace. Try not to organize your wedding during a tournament.\n\n**Play by intent:** During movement phase state your intent where you place your models. Like this model is behind the building, you shouldn't be able to see it from this and this angle. This model is touching the objective. This way you can avoid having to double check LoS during alter phases or gotcha moments, where you opponent tries to capitalize on small errors. Of yourse offer the same courtesy to them, so if their intent was to hide that big bug behind a ruin, don't all of a sudden tell them, that you can see them and you are going to shoot them. This again reduces the disputes. But don't let people abuse this.\n\n**Have a game plan:** I know that this game is hard and not everyone is a tactical and strategic genius. But have an idea what you want to do and how to achive it. Don't be reactive, be proactive, meaning, plan your moves during your opponents turn and not when it's your turn. You can check LoS and measure distances anytime, so why not using your opponents turn to do so? It's not 4th edition, where you were not allowed to pre-measure :D\n\nTl/dr.: it's the small things that add up to a lot of wasted time.\n\n## Comment ID l71404r with +1 score by [(corrin_avatan, Reddit, 2024-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1d75yqn/tournament_players_how_long_do_2k_games_take/l71404r/) (in reply to ID 1d75yqn):\nOP, can you clarify a comment you made, you're saying that the game you had pictured, you played from 3pm to midnight ***and you only ended up finishing the top of the 2nd battle round/the person who got to go first's 2nd turn?***\n\nThere seems to be something absolutely wrong here, as that means on average each turn you guys are doing are long enough that even \"longer\" tournament games of 3 hours are able to fit within them.\n\nAre you guys only playing with 5 total dice?

Think about when you take stock of the table. Do you each spend maybe 5-10 minutes in your command phases thinking about what to do and where to move? That's at least 1 hour just there. If you plan your moves while your opponent plays. Know where you have shooting lanes, know how you want to move to achieve secondaries. Know the way to objectives, if you're suddenly screened out suring your opponents movement phase, think about how to counter while your opponent plays on.

It does depend on my opponent. I have played the game for a long time so we don't spend very long dealing with rules uncertainties. I have one very new friend and we usually play for close to 6 hours, but a lot of that time is him trying to think and do good choices with limited experience.\n\nWhen i play against other very experienced players a game is less than 4 hours even without the clocks, but that is because we know the rules and our unit stats. Generally if your opponent has some games behind them, you don't need to know their army rules in detail. Just know your own stuff and the basic game rules. There is a lot of downtime to save by just responding quicly to what happens on the table.",

However, if I go back and play it, it is so stale and boring to play. WWE 2K as a franchise has the best customization in gaming period. The gameplay is really good too. My problems with current 2K is that there is no solid mode I can hook myself into to enjoy the gameplay. GM Mode gets old after some time. MyFaction isn't my thing. Exhibition is for when friends want to play with you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUniverse Mode is supposed to be THE mode you play to get the full TV show experience. It devolved so poorly over the years though. It started off capturing the unpredictability of the TV show, and made you keep playing to find out what happens next. Now, it has become a \"create your own fun!\" mode where people have to maintain spreadsheets and now you even have to choose your own cutscenes; stripping out the last bit of unpredictability this mode did have. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't have any expectations from Universe mode in 2k24 either.

When you try to program something new, there is a ton of testing to ensure it doesn't break what's already there. Licensed games bring another complication because everything you do must also be approved by the IP holder, often down to the smallest detail.\n\n**Tldr; what we think is simple to include, is made difficult because game publishers of licensed annual titles refuse to allow developers sufficient time to include everything we want and to get it right.**\n\n### Comment ID kjl5txy with +2 score by [(zickomondo, Reddit, 2024-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/19fkbrv/sorry_those_that_hate_the_2k_wwe_games_why_what/kjl5txy/) (in reply to ID kjkqrbs):\nI want those back as well but I understand that VC had to start almost from scratch after 2k20.

I just feel like the sheer FUN we used to have in wrestling games isn't really there anymore. I credit SvR 08 with being the first game where I felt like a drastic shift was made, and suddenly the heart and soul that was put into the games before it was gone. Games since have been perfectly functional, and there's fun to be had here and there, but that feeling we used to have of \"I can't put this down\" or \"just one more match!\" hasn't been present since then. And yes I'm including games that are weirdly praised today like SvR 11, 2K14 or 2K19...which in my eyes are just \"okay\". They're there, they exist...but I never understood why people love them so much. \n\nI think a big thing for me is that I was one of those people championing wrestling games becoming more simulation based, but I realized...all too late...that, that isn't what I want. Everything became so serious and trying to mimic the TV product (especially during times when WWE was at it's worst), and I just realized how much I prefer the Arcadey stuff of the AKI games or the Smackdown games, or DoR, or SvR 06 and 07. These are games I still go back to today, and I still have an absolute blast with them...it's not just nostalgia goggles, they REALLY do still hold up. This idea of \"missing heart and soul\" isn't just some construct I thought up...going back to these games shows me that I really can feel that difference.\n\nI do give a lot credit to 2K22 and 23 (and hopefully 24), I think I've had MORE fun in those than I have in anything since SvR 08. But the games have their clear flaws, and don't hold my attention like the old games STILL do. They're more like fun little distractions, rather than games I can't wait to play again the next day. \n\nIf I could take today's sheer amount of content (except MyFaction) and just put it in No Mercy or Here Comes the Pain, I'd probably feel right at home.\n\n### Comment ID kjkvmri with +5 score by [(Mando316, Reddit, 2024-01-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/19fkbrv/sorry_those_that_hate_the_2k_wwe_games_why_what/kjkvmri/) (in reply to ID kjktjjl):\nYooooo are you my doppelgänger or something?

For context for my points, I play mainly Ai vs Ai with 95% custom creations.\n\nFor stuff I’d add, firstly some kind of chain wrestling, an improved system to 2k19. It would be a good basis, but more variation, more benefit to do it, more control over who can actually do it(I’m a sucker for making wrestlers wrestle in the way I envision, AI tendencies was great for that).\n\nAlongside that, some general revamp and improvements to submissions. Submissions in terms of watching are in a good place, they got rid of some annoying issues (fuck anytime the Ai doesn’t win by submission but goes for the pin straight after and wins, I hated that so much), but there’s some areas I’d like improved, like I want rope breaks to mean something with submissions, it would add more dimension in the minigame if you could choose between fighting the hold or crawling to the ropes/dragging opponents to the ropes.\n\nAnother thing would be limb damage being more impactful. It would probably be difficult to balance, but I want high body part damage to mean more, for it to have more of an affect, like power moves may get cancelled because you can’t hold their weight because of a bad back, or you take longer to climb the ropes due to a leg injury. It would be difficult to manage it being fun but impactful, but I’d love to see a feature like that implemented more.\n\nAlso, just making tag matches actually fun to watch, as in Ai v Ai they are so boring, they drag out, they are so slow compared to how fast paced they can be in real life, and they just aren’t interesting\n\n### Comment ID kjl8gj4 with +2 score by [(zickomondo, Reddit, 2024-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/19fkbrv/sorry_those_that_hate_the_2k_wwe_games_why_what/kjl8gj4/) (in reply to ID kjl3hyn):\nUgh ai tags are the worst.\n\n#### Comment ID kjnelpd with +1 score by [(JustC88, Reddit, 2024-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/19fkbrv/sorry_those_that_hate_the_2k_wwe_games_why_what/kjnelpd/) (in reply to ID kjl8gj4):\nAgreed, I run a universe with my friends just ai v ai and we have a tag division but never watch any matches because they suck\n\n## Comment ID kjmz50t with +3 score by [(Kiel297, Reddit, 2024-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/19fkbrv/sorry_those_that_hate_the_2k_wwe_games_why_what/kjmz50t/) (in reply to ID 19fkbrv):\nIt’s not even about what other wrestling games are better to be honest, because this series of games doesn’t have direct competition, and that’s kind of the problem.\n\nYou have to understand, some of us have been playing these from the beginning.

Season mode got replaced with a slightly watered down Road To Wrestlemania, which got replaced with an even more watered down Showcase mode.\n\nThis series has been in a serious decline in quality for years and it is very apparent that 2K don’t actually care whether we’re happy with the product or not, just as long as we keep spending money.\n\nThat’s my problem with these games. That’s why I went from being a guaranteed day one purchase every year and even setting up this subreddit cos I loved the games so much, to refusing to spend money until I have proof that it’s actually good. 2K19 was the last time I pre-ordered. 2K20 and 2K22 I didn’t buy, 2K23 I got in a humble bundle.\n\nIt’s not about other games being better. There doesn’t need to be a better game for me to think that these ones aren’t good enough.\n\nI’m really hoping that 2K24 delivers more than they have the last few years.\n\n### Comment ID kjo4lv6 with +1 score by [(zickomondo, Reddit, 2024-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/19fkbrv/sorry_those_that_hate_the_2k_wwe_games_why_what/kjo4lv6/) (in reply to ID kjmz50t):\nI agree 100% with you. I also have been playing wrestling games since NES, so I know what a good wrestling game should look and feel like. I just think too many people nitpick at the 2k games without ever uplifting any other title. We all have the same problem with the 2k games, so I asked if there were other games people prefer because I'd like to try those.\n\nI also think that a lot of people feel nostalgic for the older games as opposed to wanting an exact replica of those games. They just remember how much fun wrestling games felt 10 years ago. I was 30 in 2014, and even then I think back to how much people were complaining about little things in 2k14. But now it seems like everyone universally loves it. It wasn't like that back then.\n\n## Comment ID l10a8sy with +3 score by [(BeastKalEl, Reddit, 2024-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/19fkbrv/sorry_those_that_hate_the_2k_wwe_games_why_what/l10a8sy/) (in reply to ID 19fkbrv):\nMight be a little late to this, but they're just not fun. Every new title has something going for it, new innovation, new roster addition, new realism mechanic, new camera angles etc. etc. yet with every new WWE game and every new addition to it, keeping the player playing the game and having fun doing so is never something that's considered. I'd also say that for my age group (late 20s to early 30s) it is hard to get into these 2K games because we were very spoiled with what we had early on. The first wrestling game I ever touched was No Mercy and I must have been like 5 or 6 years old. That was my initial benchmark for a wrestling game. Later down the line, we got S tier titles like Shut Your Mouth, Here Comes the Pain, Smackdown vs Raw, Smackdown vs Raw 2006, & the Day of Reckoning series all one right after the other.\n\nIt is just SAD when for the first time in YEARS I pick up a new title, WWE 2k18, and it's slower, buggier, less fun, less interactive, and less satisfying than the PS2 titles and on top of all this garbage, they even have the NERVE to make me purchase loot boxes in order to unlock clothes for my CAW's career mode. I'm sorry, but I just shouldn't be getting a better, fuller, less grindy and more fun experience playing HCTP on the PS2 than the latest 2K game on my high end PC.\n\n## Comment ID kjl26kb with +8 score by [(jackblady, Reddit, 2024-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/19fkbrv/sorry_those_that_hate_the_2k_wwe_games_why_what/kjl26kb/) (in reply to ID 19fkbrv):\nWhy do I dislike the games?\n\nThey are unfinished and broken, with some glitches lasting for years.

The leanring curve is steep, but it is incredible. There's also King Of Colosseum, which is fire pro in 3d with a few extra elements. \n\nPersonally, I love the first GM mode and wish that I could play this with modern wrestlers. I don't want all the restrictions of later games, but being able to do stories and such would be much more fun. I want just a perfect GM mode\n\nI also want a really great university mode as well, I wish they would pump most of their resources into that. Along with match types, but it seems we will be getting them\n\nI like older wwe games in the sense of the arcade feeling and just insane fun. In HCTP you can climb up times Square and toss someone off. You can climb up a helicopter snd dive off onto a limo. I've probably played more HCTP than any other wrestling game. \n\nWrestling empire is in a weird state, it's an absolute terrible mess of a game. It's clunky, it's ugly, but it is absolutely a blast to play. It controls terribly and is an awful Wrestling game, but as far as being able to have 90 sticks of dynamite in the ring as the match starts or have 30 people inside of a cage match, that's the game for you. For pure fun, it's the way to go. But if you want a good wrestling game, look elsewhere\n\n## Comment ID kjlt8yc with +2 score by [(Precious_little_man, Reddit, 2024-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/19fkbrv/sorry_those_that_hate_the_2k_wwe_games_why_what/kjlt8yc/) (in reply to ID 19fkbrv):\nWe will never all agree on everything.

I knew everything would be locked behind it forcing you to grind instead of making the wrestler you wanted. Can’t make the entrance you want because the pose or pyro or lighting or song was hidden behind VC. Can’t use the clothing you want because it’s hidden behind VC. Can’t use the move you want because it’s hidden behind VC. Last game I played was 16 or 17 when my friend bought it and everything I feared would happen happened.

It's more of a frustration thing. I know we aren't supposed to bring up the classics. But the classics used to put so much in their games and allow so much freedom. While 2k always feels like a title being held back by the corporate suits. However, 2K24 finally feels like they've been given the freedom to create an awesome experience.\n\n## Comment ID kjkjrsi with +3 score by [(dr_bluthgeld, Reddit, 2024-01-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/19fkbrv/sorry_those_that_hate_the_2k_wwe_games_why_what/kjkjrsi/) (in reply to ID 19fkbrv):\nI got Fire Pro World on sale last weekend, there's a small learning curve but once you've got it down it's really fun and makes for exciting matches.

Something I can pick up quick, something I can have a friend or my dad over and explain the basics enough to get by to just play. \n\nI can appreciate the joy stick motions and combos and advanced reversals but there needs to be an option to dumb it down. NHL even still has options to use NHL 94 controls. (Which I use current skill stick controls so don’t call me a boomer). \n\nSomething between HCTP and SvR 2010 would be ideal of simplicity/arcade style but enough of realism. Though for reference my heyday was between KYR and SvR 05\n\nAll Stars and Battlegrounds were way too over the top for me. I like graphical realism but not long, drawn out simulated animations. Let me get goofy with quick strikes, quick grapples, fast reaction reversals. \n\nPaywalls, FOMO tactics, exclusivities ruined any interest I’d ever have. I don’t mind a grind, I like season modes, in-game currency. I don’t want real money involved. I want to be able to unlock everything through gameplay, and be able to use any character with any attire in any mode. It’s 2024 and we are creating more technical barriers than opening. As an IT guy it’s so infuriating to watch a company create false barriers just to use monetary incentive to justify them. \n\nI don’t have any current wrestling game I play. Still on my PS2. Unfortunately AEW’s option was extremely underwhelming though I think it was going in the better direction than 2K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID kjkgx9c with +1 score by [(xSEARLEYx, Reddit, 2024-01-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/19fkbrv/sorry_those_that_hate_the_2k_wwe_games_why_what/kjkgx9c/) (in reply to ID 19fkbrv):\nA gripe I have with the games is how outdated they are at launch.

Let me roll out during royal rumbles, increase 8 active entrants, stack tables, tables and ladders not falling down when people slide in the ring, not have to grapple before every move, let every payback be used online, random elimination chamber entrants, more weapon attacks, weapons being part of the environment (i.e. if I suplex someone onto a ladder, it should hurt more than the mat), more meaningful MyRise decisions and freedoms (I like the idea of MyRise but it has sucked the past two years), reverse moves into other moves instead of just having a single reversal animation.

I would just play 2k19 but i want an updated roster so I get bored extremely fast. The gameplay isn't too big of a problem but i prefer simulation gameplay over the arcade gameplay we have now. I like a slower pace. I want it to feel like a real match. I think having an option to switch between the two would be nice and would make both sides happy. Other than that i like the current game.

I've had multiple people tell me that they didn't understand what they were supposed to be doing in their new roles as the org restructured for the third time. \n\nLack of Development Opportunities: They've discussed something about career paths but nothing has come of this in years.

Water seeks its own level. And the watermark is high here.\r\n\r\nEveryone here has met two tenets: Exceptional talent and exceptional character. We have a no a-holes policy. No level of skill or ability excuses toxic personalities. We believe Trust matters most towards an environment of psychological safety where we can take risks to innovate and grow to achieve excellence in all we do.\r\n\r\nWe laugh a LOT here and we work hard. We believe that you can bring your best and whole self to work and that will make you, the team and game better. We value each other as people first. \r\n\r\nI truly look forward to going to work every Monday. I've been fortunate to work in an Industry I love for many years. I'm even more fortunate to be happier than I've ever been in my work at this stage of my career. \r\n\r\n31st Union is a unique team of amazing people. I'm grateful and humbled to be a part of it.",

I've had multiple people tell me that they didn't understand what they were supposed to be doing in their new roles as the org restructured for the third time. \n\nLack of Development Opportunities: They've discussed something about career paths but nothing has come of this in years.

      "# [2K to reveal new game in one of its \"biggest and most beloved\" franchises next month by Matt Wales on 2024-05-16](https://www.eurogamer.net/2k-to-reveal-new-game-in-one-of-its-biggest-and-most-beloved-franchises-next-month)\n2K Games is poised to reveal the next game in one of its \"biggest and most beloved\" franchises, with the grand unveiling set to happen in June.\n\nMore specifically, the big reveal is scheduled for Friday, 7th June, and will take place during Geoff Keighley's big Summer Game Fest live event.\n\nNews of 2K's impending reveal came via Summer Game Fest's official social media account, but details remain vague. It offered no hints as to what might be coming, leaving everyone to speculate what, exactly, that \"biggest and most beloved\" franchises could be.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nBioShock is an obvious candidate, given 2K confirmed a new series entry was in development all the way back in 2019. Little has been revealed about the project since then, but a report in 2021 claimed the title - which is being developed by new studio Cloud Chamber - would be set in an Antarctic city sometime during the 1960s.\n\nAlternatively, it's possible 2K Games' big reveal will be a new Mafia title - Mafia 3 developer Hangar 13 confirmed it was working on one back in August 2022. As with BioShock, little is known about this latest Mafia project beyond reports it'll be a prequel to the existing trilogy. However, a 2024 reveal might be a little premature given it was still \"a few years away\" when it was announced in 2022.\n\nSo what else? It's always possible Gearbox - which 2K parent company Take-Two Interactive acquired from Embracer earlier this year - will have something to show. References to Borderlands 4 and Tiny Tina's Wonderland 2 both surfaced on a former Gearbox technical director's LinkedIn profile late last year, even though neither has been formally confirmed.\n\nA Borderlands announcement would arguably make the most sense, however, seeing as 2K and Gearbox will almost certainly want to push something out to coincide with the Borderlands movie, which is currently due to hit cinemas in August this year. Thankfully, it won't be long until 2K puts all this specualtion to rest, given 7th June is just three weeks away.",

However, earlier this year, Insider Gamer reported that FIFA and 2K were “working to announce a partnership for 2K to make an officially-licensed FIFA game.” So this isn’t the first time we’ve seen reports like this.\n\nIn May 2022, Electronic Arts announced the termination of its 30-year agreement with FIFA. As a result, the football game franchise was renamed EA Sports FC, marking the beginning of a new chapter in the company’s history.\n\nEA Sports FC 24, the first installment in the updated series, launched last year and debuted at #1 on the UK Boxed Charts. It also peaked at over 82k concurrent users on Steam alone and reached 11.3 million players in its first week across all platforms.\n\nIf 2K really did manage to secure the official FIFA license, it would be a strong addition to its portfolio of sports game, which includes series such as NBA 2K, PGA Tour 2K, WWE 2K, and Top Spin.",

As often happens in these cases, the rumor started when MP1st spotted on a LinkedIn resume of a 2K Games 3D artist and Motion Capture Animator the following list of games:\n\nNew Mafia game\n\nNew BioShock game\n\nSupermassive Games project codenamed Erebus (and canceled)\n\nUpcoming Unannounced Remake\n\nWe already knew that Hangar 13 (which recently released Top Spin 2K25) was making a new entry in the Mafia franchise. Studio General Manager Roman Hladík confirmed as much in August 2022, when the series was celebrating its twentieth anniversary:\n\nI'm happy to confirm we've started work on an all-new Mafia project! While it's a few years away and we can't share anything more right now, we're really excited to keep working on this beloved franchise and to entertain our players with new stories.\n\nThe same goes for BioShock, of course. The new installment in the dystopian first-person shooter franchise was announced in late 2019, and yet Cloud Chamber is still ramping up recruitment for the project. The third project is also interesting. Supermassive Games partnered with 2K Games to make The Quarry, which launched in June 2022 to a very positive (9/10) review here on Wccftech. It looks like they were making another game codenamed Erebus; however, it was eventually canceled, which may explain the studio's massive layoffs of a third of its staff a few months ago.\n\nThe news of the day is, however, the unannounced remake. Given the publisher's big portfolio, it's really hard to even figure out what it could be. Granted, it's not any one of their sports franchises since remaking an annual sports game wouldn't really make any sense.\n\nThat leaves mostly X-COM, Mafia, Civilization, Borderlands, and BioShock. However, Mafia already got a remake for the first game and a remaster of the second game. BioShock also received remasters as part of the trilogy collection. Perhaps Gearbox's next Borderlands game (which had been rumored to be unveiled at Summer Game Fest 2024 but wasn't there after all) is actually a remake of the first one? That one got a remaster, too.\n\nWhatever the case, it's something else to look forward to from 2K Games. We'll keep you apprised on any further rumors and leaks on the project.",

      "# [2K Games has added Denuvo to NBA 2K25 at launch by John Papadopoulos on 2024-09-04](https://www.dsogaming.com/news/2k-games-has-added-denuvo-to-nba-2k25-at-launch/)\nWell, we knew something was fishy. When 2K Games launched the Steam store page for NBA 2K25, it did not list the Denuvo anti-tamper tech. This was an attempt to completely mislead PC gamers as the company hadn’t even included Denuvo in its EULA. However, now that the game has been released, 2K Games added the Denuvo anti-tamper tech to the store page.\n\nAs I wrote in my previous article.\n\n“Moreover, NBA 2K25 may not have Denuvo. That, or 2K Games simply did not include it in a way to mislead its PC customers.”\n\nYep. 2K Games has deliberately excluded Denuvo from the Steam store page. Of course, its inclusion should not come as a surprise. After all, NBA 2K24 used it. So, it was almost a given that NBA 2K25 would be also using it.\n\nNBA 2K25 will also require a 2K sports account. This appears to be a mandatory requirement and not an optional one. So, make sure to also keep that in mind. Then again, if you’ve played NBA 2K24, you’ve already created a 2K account.\n\nEarlier this month, 2K Games revealed that the PC version will have Ray Tracing. These RT effects will only be available in The City. 2K Games has not clarified whether these Ray Tracing effects will appear on consoles. We also don’t know how the devs will use RT. Will they simply enhance the game’s reflections? Or will they take advantage of RTGI?\n\nRight now, the game has Mixed Reviews on Steam. For those wondering, the game is already available to those who have pre-ordered it. The rest will be able to play it on September 6th.\n\nFinally, you can find its official PC requirements here. So, if you are interested in this basketball game, I suggest taking a look at them.\n\n2K Games has not provided us with a PC review code. Since our audience is not that interested in this game, we may not cover it. Yes, the PC version is on par with the current-gen console version this year. However, the NBA 2K games never had a benchmark tool. So, it can be a bit tricky benchmarking it. Different camera angles can result in completely different results.\n\nBut anyway. If you show interest, we will cover it. If not, we’ll skip it.\n\nStay tuned for more!",

      "# [‘Borderlands 4’ Launching in 2025, Teaser Released by Jennifer Maas on 2024-08-20](https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/borderlands-4-teaser-2025-release-date-1236112548/)\nA new game in the “Borderlands” saga, “Borderlands 4,” will be launching from 2K Games in 2025.\n\nPer 2K’s description for the title: “See if you have what it takes to go down in history as a legendary Vault Hunter as you search for secret alien treasure, blasting everything in sight.”\n\nThe Gearbox-developed game, which was announced out of the Gamescom video game convention Tuesday, is available to add to wishlists now. This game marks the fourth mainline “Borderlands” title and the seventh in the overall franchise, which has sold more than 87 million copies to date.\n\n2K Games parent company Take-Two Interactive revealed in March plans to acquire “Borderlands” maker Gearbox from Embracer Group for $460 million. As part of that deal, which closed in June, Take-Two got the rights to Gearbox IP, including “Borderlands,” “Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands,” “Homeworld,” “Risk of Rain,” “Brothers in Arms” and “Duke Nukem.”\n\nAt the time of the acquisition announcement, Gearbox teased it had six “key interactive entertainment projects in various stages of development,” which included five sequels, two from “Borderlands” and “Homeworld” universes, and at least one “exciting new intellectual property,” all of which have been acquired in the sale. Today’s reveal of “Borderlands 4” marks the first confirmation of one of those projects moving out of the development stage.\n\n“The team and I at Gearbox have a lot we’ve wanted to do with ‘Borderlands’ since we first introduced the looter shooter genre to the world with our original game,” Gearbox founder and president Randy Pitchford said. “All of us at Gearbox have massive ambitions for ‘Borderlands 4’ and are putting everything we have into making everything we love about ‘Borderlands’ better than ever before while taking the game to new levels in exciting new directions.”\n\n“We’re thrilled to be able to share with our fans that 2025 will mark a massive year for 2K and Gearbox Entertainment,” 2K core games senior vice president and general manager Catharina Lavers Mallet said. “The ‘Borderlands’ series is one of 2K’s most successful franchises ever and is beloved by millions globally. We’re excited that our already close partnership and collaboration with the Gearbox team has grown even deeper, and we look forward to delivering best-in-class experiences for both longtime fans and new players alike.”\n\nThe “Borderlands 4” announcement comes on the heels of the “Borderlands” film starring Cate Blanchett recently bombing at the box office.\n\nWatch the trailer for “Borderlands 4” below.",

Hosted by Geoff Keighley, the creator of The Game Awards, the stream primarily focused on new or first looks at previously announced games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Sid Meier’s Civilization 7, Monster Hunter Wilds, and Dune: Awakening.\n\nBut there were more than a few surprises, including new game announcements and reveals, at Gamescom ONL. Here’s a breakdown of the biggest trailers and announcements that were shown.\n\nBorderlands 4\n\nGearbox Software is officially back in the Borderlands business. At Gamescom ONL, 2K games and Gearbox announced Borderlands 4 in the form of a cinematic teaser. The new Borderlands game is out sometime in 2025 and, according to an official description, “players will assume the role of a legendary Vault Hunter as they blast their way through hordes of enemies in search of new treasures to loot on an all-new planet.”\n\nMafia: The Old Country\n\nDeveloper Hangar 13 is returning to the Mafia franchise in 2025. The studio, and publisher 2K Games, revealed Mafia: The Old Country, a new entry that will send the series back to Italy. Mafia: The Old Country promises to “uncover the origins of organized crime” with a “gritty mob story set in the brutal underworld of 1900s Sicily.” Hangar 13 promises the “authentic realism and rich storytelling” the Mafia series is known for. Details are scant, but expect more in December, the game’s makers say — probably at The Game Awards, if we’re guessing.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle\n\nBethesda not only gave us a new look at Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, we also (finally) got a release date: Dec. 9 on Windows PC and Xbox Series X. But PlayStation fans can also get their hands on Indy, with a PS5 version announced for spring 2025. For more on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, read Polygon’s preview of the game.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6\n\nCall of Duty fans got a lengthy look at new gameplay from Black Ops 6, which ran the gamut from political blackmail to stealthy close-quarters gunplay to a gunfire-and-explosion-filled street chase through Washington, D.C. on the back of a motorcycle. More to come at Call of Duty Next.\n\nDying Light: The Beast\n\nTechland revealed a new game in its zombie adventure franchise at Gamescom with Dying Light: The Beast, which the developer describes as a “thrilling standalone zombie adventure set in a tightly-crafted rural region.” Players take on the role of Kyle Crane, who breaks free after years of brutal experiments and seeks revenge. Dying Light: The Beast is coming to PC, PlayStation, and Xbox platforms\n\nDirective 8020\n\nA new entry in the The Dark Pictures anthology, Supermassive Games’ Directive 8020 stars Lashana Lynch (Captain Marvel, The Woman King) in an all-new sci-fi survival horror adventure. Lynch plays the ground-breaking astronaut, Young, in what Supermassive describes as “an immersive cinematic horror experience that blends intense survival gameplay with a branching narrative storyline.” Directive 8020 is out in 2025.\n\nGoat Simulator Remastered\n\nFor the 10th anniversary of Goat Simulator, Coffee Stain Publishing is bringing back the original in remastered form with upgraded graphics and lighting, as well as “many intentional features that definitely aren’t bugs, and fan-favourite DLC, all in one package.” Goat Simulator Remastered drops in 2024.\n\nKing of Meat\n\nGeoff Keighley himself starred in the reveal trailer for King of Meat, a four-player hacking, slashing, co-op combat game from Amazon Games and studio Glowmade in which players fight through “ridiculous” user-created dungeons. King of Meat is coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.\n\nDeveloper FuzzyBot announced Lynked: Banner of the Spark at Opening Night Live. It’s an “arcade-inspired co-op adventure that blends hack and slash combat with roguelike and town-building elements.”\n\nLost Records: Bloom & Rage\n\nLife is Strange developer Don’t Nod revealed new gameplay and a release date for its next game, the ’90s-set narrative adventure Lost Records: Bloom & Rage. The episodic game will launch in two parts on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X on Feb. 18 and March 18, 2025.\n\nARC Raiders\n\nEmbark Studios, creator of The Finals, brought its long-delayed shooter ARC Raiders to Gamescom for a re-reveal. The PvPvE action survival shooter is now coming in 2025 to PS5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. ARC Raiders’ first public tech test is now scheduled for Oct. 24-27.\n\nInfinity Nikki\n\nInfinity Nikki, the cozy, open-world adventure game fueled by the power of dressing up, got a new look at Gamescom — and news of an upcoming closed beta on mobile platforms.\n\nDune: Awakening\n\nFuncom showed actual gameplay from its open-world survival MMO set in the Dune universe, detailing the journey from “survivor to spice hunter.” Players will expand their influence on Arrakis through combat, spice, building, and trade when Dune: Awakening arrives in early 2025 on PC. PS5 and Xbox versions are due later.\n\nReanimal\n\nLittle Nightmares developer Tarsier Studios revealed its next game, a terrifying new adventure called Reanimal. Described as a co-op horror adventure game, players take on the roles of brother and sister who “go through hell to rescue their missing friends.” Reanimal is playable solo or in local and online co-op, and it’s coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X.\n\nMonster Hunter Wilds\n\nCapcom showed off more from its impressively open-world new Monster Hunter game at Gamescom ONL, covering the new area the Scarlet Forest, new monster Lala Barina, and Windward Plains apex predator Rey Dau. Monster Hunter Wilds also has some tasty looking meat — increasingly a Capcom specialty.\n\nSid Meier’s Civilization 7\n\nFiraxis Games showed off first gameplay from Sid Meier’s Civilization 7, but the depth of the next Civ will warrant much more than that. Expect gameplay deep dives and interviews from Gamescom throughout the week. Firaxis also announced a release date of Feb. 11, 2025.\n\nMarvel Rivals\n\nMarvel and NetEase Games’ kinda-Overwatch-y team-based game, Marvel Rivals, has two new heroes: Captain America and The Winter Soldier (aka Bucky Barnes). And it has a release date: Marvel Rivals is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X on Dec. 6.\n\nPrime Video’s Secret Level\n\nSecret Level is a new animated anthology series from the creatives behind Love, Death + Robots. It will feature original stories set in the worlds of Armored Core, Dungeons & Dragons, Mega Man, Pac-Man, Sifu, Spelunky, The Outer Worlds, Unreal Tournament, Warhammer 40,000 and more.\n\nStarfield\n\nBethesda Game Studios showed up with some Starfield content, including a look (and imminent release) of the REV-8 land vehicle and a tease of the Shattered Space DLC coming on Sept. 30. The free REV-8 update gives players the freedom to explore new frontiers and reach new heights, Bethesda said.\n\nMonument Valley 3\n\nA new Monument Valley game is coming. Monument Valley 3’s gorgeous, mind-bending puzzles will arrive exclusively on Netflix Games on Dec. 10, along with both Monument Valley and Monument Valley 2.\n\nBatman: Arkham Shadow\n\nThe next Batman Arkham game is for VR. Set between the events of Batman: Arkham Origins and Batman: Arkham Asylum, players will step Batman’s cape and cowl as he takes on the Rat King and reunites with familiar faces Harleen Quinzel, Jim Gordon, Harvey Dent, and Dr. Crane — before some of them become villains — in Batman: Arkham Shadow.\n\nMasters of Albion\n\nFable, Populous, and Black & White creator Peter Molyneux is back and making a new game for consoles and PC. Masters of Albion will tap into some of Molyneux’s most beloved games, giving players godlike control and letting them possess characters for direct, third-person action.\n\nSquid Game: Unleashed\n\nThe deadly survival games of Netflix’s breakout hit Squid Game are coming to mobile with a new, even deadlier series of challenges. Squid Game: Unleashed is (of course) coming to Netflix, but does not have a release date.\n\nDiablo 4: Vessel of Hatred\n\nPlayers won’t go it alone when Diablo 4’s first expansion, Vessel of Hatred, goes live on Oct. 8. They’ll be joined by members of the Pale Hand, a group of mercenaries that got an introduction from Blizzard Entertainment at Gamescom ONL."
