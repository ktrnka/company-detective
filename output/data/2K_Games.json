  "summary_markdown": "# About 2K Games\n\n2K Games, founded in 2005, is a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. The company is a prominent video game publisher known for its diverse portfolio, which includes sports, action, and strategy games. 2K Games operates across various platforms, including consoles, PCs, and mobile devices, and is home to several renowned development studios such as Firaxis Games, Visual Concepts, and Hangar 13 [(2K, 2024)](cache://newsroom-2k/4).\n\n2K Games generates revenue primarily through the sale of its video games, which are distributed both physically and digitally. The company caters to a broad audience, including casual gamers, sports enthusiasts, and fans of narrative-driven experiences. Its product lineup includes popular franchises like NBA 2K, Borderlands, BioShock, and Sid Meier's Civilization [(2K, 2024)](cache://newsroom-2k/4).\n\nThe company has been actively expanding its offerings, with new titles and updates announced for several of its franchises. 2K Games is also involved in community engagement through events and contests, such as the NBA 2K25 Logo Gauntlet [(2K, 2024)](https://nba.2k.com/2k25/logo-gauntlet/rules/).\n\n2K Games is part of Take-Two Interactive, which is publicly traded on NASDAQ under the symbol TTWO. The company has reported significant sales figures, with the Civilization franchise alone selling over 70 million copies and accumulating more than 1 billion hours of gameplay [(2K, 2024)](cache://newsroom-2k/4).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nWhile specific details about the leadership team at 2K Games were not provided in the sources, it is known that 2K is part of Take-Two Interactive, which has a well-established executive team in the gaming industry. The company's culture promotes innovation and creativity, focusing on delivering high-quality gaming experiences and building a diverse and inclusive team [(Vancouver Canada Official Site)](https://sportslab.2k.com/).\n\n# News\n\n## Unionization Efforts\n\nIn a significant move for labor rights in the gaming industry, workers at 2K's motion capture studio in California voted to unionize under the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE). This marks the first unionization of a motion capture studio in the gaming sector, with workers advocating for better job security, fair pay, and improved working conditions. Matthew Peterson, a motion capture animator, expressed optimism about negotiating in good faith with management [(Batchelor, GamesIndustry.biz, 2024)](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/2k-games-motion-capture-studio-votes-to-unionise).\n\n## Removal of 2K Launcher\n\n2K Games has officially removed its proprietary launcher from all titles that previously required it, including popular games like BioShock and Civilization VI. This decision, which took effect on November 18, 2024, was met with positive feedback from the gaming community, as the launcher had been criticized for causing performance issues and unnecessary complications for players [(Wolens, PC Gamer, 2024)](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/we-just-beat-a-pc-gaming-villain-2k-removes-its-pointless-game-breaking-launcher-from-its-entire-catalogue/).\n\n# Product Overview: 2K Games Titles\n\n## Upcoming Releases\n\n1. **Borderlands 4**\n   - Scheduled for release in early 2025, Borderlands 4 will introduce players to a new planet and a cast of four new Vault Hunters. The game promises dynamic movement abilities, deep skill trees, and a variety of weapons, continuing the franchise's tradition of chaotic gameplay [(2K, 2024)](https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/).\n\n2. **Sid Meier's Civilization VII**\n   - Announced for a 2025 release, Civilization VII aims to build on the franchise's legacy with innovative features and gameplay mechanics. Sid Meier, the franchise's creator, expressed excitement about the new installment [(2K, 2024)](cache://newsroom-2k/4).\n\n3. **NBA 2K25**\n   - The latest installment in the NBA 2K series, NBA 2K25, has introduced new content and rewards for its second season, including collaborations with artists for its soundtrack and new in-game items [(2K, 2024)](https://newsroom-uk.2k.com/news/nbar-2k25-season-2-accept-the-challenge-to-become-the-best-of-the-best-starting-on-october-18).\n\n## Community Engagement and Contests\n\n2K Games has been actively engaging its community through various contests and events. The NBA 2K25 Logo Gauntlet allows players to compete in a game show format, with opportunities to win in-game currency and exclusive items. This initiative not only promotes player interaction but also enhances the competitive spirit within the community [(2K, 2024)](https://nba.2k.com/2k25/logo-gauntlet/rules/).\n\n# Conclusion\n\n2K Games continues to innovate and expand its portfolio with upcoming titles and community-focused initiatives. The recent unionization of its motion capture studio reflects a growing trend towards labor organization in the gaming industry, while the removal of the 2K Launcher demonstrates responsiveness to player feedback. As the company prepares for the release of major titles like Borderlands 4 and Civilization VII, it remains a significant entity in the gaming landscape, appealing to both players and investors alike.",

      "# [Want To Know More About The Quarry Horror Game?](https://quarrygame.2k.com/faq/)\nA: The Quarry is an all-new teen-horror narrative game, where every decision shapes your unique story from a tangled web of possibilities. Any character can be the star of the show - or die - before daylight comes. Take control of nine camp counselors and, using your wits in conversation and reflexes during action, do everything you can to steer them away from—or directly into—danger.\n\nA: Yes! The Quarry offers multiple ways for you to experience the fright with friends. You can play the game solo, or with up to seven other companions in local couch co-op with each player controlling a counselor's actions. In addition, The Quarry features an exciting online mode where you and your friends can watch along and vote on key decisions, creating a story shaped by the whole group!\n\nConsole players: Note that online multiplayer is only supported across the same PlayStation/Xbox generations (PS4 to PS4, PS5 to PS5, Xbox One to Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S to Xbox Series X|S). If you buy the Deluxe Edition you'll have access to both previous- and new-generation versions of the game (within the same console family) and can choose which one to launch in order to play with friends.\n\nA: Death Rewind is a retry mechanic that normally unlocks after your first completion of The Quarry. Start the story with three opportunities to reverse a playable character's death, giving you a chance to alter fate and save them in the process. But with only three retries per playthrough, you'll have to decide when someone's life is truly worth saving, and the undoing of one horrible end may lead to another. Choose wisely.\n\nA: Yes. If you own a digital version of The Quarry for PlayStation 4 or Xbox One you can purchase the Digital Upgrade to provide access to the new-gen version within the same console family and entitled to the same Xbox network or PlayStation Network account.\n\nIf you own a physical version of The Quarry for PlayStation 4 you have the option to purchase the PS5 Digital Upgrade if you own a PlayStation 5 with a disc drive. The PlayStation 4 The Quarry disc must be inserted into the PlayStation 5 whenever playing the new-gen digital version of the game.\n\nA: Our goal with Streamer Mode was to provide a simple and streamlined way for players to create content for The Quarry that included music. Due to evolving standards and practices with how licensed music is implemented and tracked across games and content, this wasn’t the case at launch and we decided to switch the name to \"Alternate Music\" to better set expectations for our streaming community. We also recommend adding “The Quarry” in their video/streaming headline to help avoid any issues.",

      "# [Game Overview](https://quarrygame.2k.com/gameplay/)\n'50s THROWBACK OUTFITS*\n\nIf our calculations are correct, these '50s-themed character outfits are sure to knock your socks off.\n\n'80s THROWBACK OUTFITS**\n\nSend the camp counselors' looks back in time with a retro pack full of ‘80s-inspired character outfits.\n\nChoose your counselor in local co-op\n\nWith The Quarry's couch co-op mode, you and up to seven friends can experience the horror together. Each player is assigned to play as one or more counselors, with one controller passed around the group each time a different counselor becomes the current playable character. Whether you decide to work together or suddenly swerve the story in a new direction is up to you!\n\nVotes control fate in online play\n\nThe online multiplayer of The Quarry functions differently from the local co-op play. In this invite-only mode, a host can invite up to seven friends with access to the game to watch along. While the host plays, their audience votes on each key decision, with the majority vote determining the outcome.\n\nTurn The Quarry into a bingeable teen horror experience with Movie Mode! In this mode, you can determine a number of variables to make the story play out as you see fit. Decide if everyone lives or dies, or tweak specific character behavior patterns to see how each counselor will react in casual and critical situations alike.\n\nBy default, choices in The Quarry have a dwindling timer to add tension—but you can customize the experience via the accessibility options so that anyone can enjoy the horror. Along with color blind variants and aim assist settings, you can tweak the duration of timers on choices and Quick Time Events, along with the option to reduce the intensity of button-mashing QTEs."

With those games you need an online 2K account that is required to be linked to the game in order to play(no separate launcher). \n\nAs they intergrate more VC(virtual currency) mtx in-game shops into as many modes, it will be required to be always online where VC is present and on top of that 2K layer of DRM, the titles could(varys) have Denuvo.\n\n## Comment ID lz5rzlc with +1 score by [(MadeByTango, Reddit, 2024-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1gzv803/2k_launcher_complete_sunset/lz5rzlc/) (in reply to ID 1gzv803):\nThe Xcom 2 mods remain a mess (requires them a whole second link to explain); but it’s just gonna take time adjusting, glad to have the 2K launcher gone",

After login at [https://accounts.2k.com/](https://accounts.2k.com/en-US), if you visit [https://accounts.2k.com/v2/me](https://accounts.2k.com/v2/me) it should show you what platforms have been connected to your 2k account. This is their API. I saw that I have 5 platforms connected and Game Center is among them. \n\nFrom their account page, I could see other platforms except for game center. Other platforms can be unlinked by visiting the unlink endpoints like [https://accounts.2k.com/auth/nintendo/unlink](https://accounts.2k.com/auth/nintendo/unlink). But it didn't work for gamecenter. [https://accounts.2k.com/auth/gamecenter/unlink](https://accounts.2k.com/auth/gamecenter/unlink) redirects me to a 404 page.\n\nI will continue trying to contact Aspyr support.

I stopped caring for a while but tried to get it working again. In the past I contacted 2K and Aspyr but only got tips from them. I just got it working again but there was a lot of trial and error as I also used Steam to play as well. Here is a list of things to try (most are listed in the thread in one way or another):\n\n1. Disconnect 2K from all other accounts, steam, epic, google (this is accessible on 2K's site)\n2. Log out of 2K in all Civ VI games (whether steam, switch, PS, Xbox, etc)\n3. Restore purchases (on ios: \"Get More Content\" -> \"Restore Purchases\")\n4. Logging out of your Apple ID (go the \"Settings\" app, click your apple ID name in the top, under \"iCloud\", \"Media & Purchases\", \"Find My\", etc, there should be a \"Sign Out\" option)\n\nNote: Every time you change something, reset the app (not just exiting out, in the Home screen, swiping up and pausing so you see what apps are open and swipe civ vi away). Yes its tedious but changes won't go into affect until you do that (they also say wait 15 min but I'm impatient)\n\nOption 4 is what worked for me most recently. For that though, I logged out, opened Civ and the option to login to 2K was available (the logo turned Red from Grey previously) but you need iCloud in order to connect 2K. So with Civ still open in the background, I logged back in and did not allow my iCloud to merge. Then I reset the app and it was working. I know the iCloud merge is probably not possible for everyone but it was what worked. \n\nIt seems like in order to make this work, you need your ios game to believe this is your only civ/2k account. It's stupid and you would think after years it would be fixed but alas. May your achievements not be deleted and your clouds connect.\n\n## Comment ID ev0wciq with +1 score by [(Nickjrock, Reddit, 2019-07-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/ch8qpi/impossible_to_login_to_2k_account_on_civ_6_ios/ev0wciq/) (in reply to ID ch8qpi):\nSame here\n\n### Comment ID ev0wpiq with +1 score by [(crackofdawn, Reddit, 2019-07-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/ch8qpi/impossible_to_login_to_2k_account_on_civ_6_ios/ev0wpiq/) (in reply to ID ev0wciq):\nI've tried everything.

That’s… I can”t say I’m surprised but I certainly am disappointed.\n\nBefore I continue writing, I’d like to thank you for your patience with any and all grammatical errors I make. English is not my first language.\n\nI figured out a way to fix this issue that  I had just now, though. This worked for me but I cannot guarantee that it works for anybody else.\n\nI honestly don’t remember how but I managed to get the  2k logo to not be greyed out. But I did (keep reading, even if you haven’t been able to do this, please!) Then connected my 2K account through the app.  \nthis caused a whole bunch of issues.\n\n\\- The 2k logo was red but said I was not logged in to it.  \n\\- Clicking the logo  prompted me to log in to my 2K account again. Tried doing that, and it said that my game center account was already linked to another 2K account.\n\nAt this point, after some cussing, I went to the 2K webpage and checked my connections. I was indeed connected to my game center account. But then why wouldn’t  the game center recognise this and make the connection?\n\nOdd.\n\nI disconnected Game Center from the connections and tried to log in through the civ game on my iPad. The exact same thing happened again. insane as I am, I did this a couple of times, expecting different results. Surprise - The exact thing happened.\n\nI finally realised that it was possible to account through the K2 webpage not use the app. So I tried that. it connected properly once I had restarted the app.  \nI obviously can’t test the theory but I suspect that using their website to connect with apple as opposed to through the  game app itself might have sorted this out for me sooner. But, as I said, it’s but a theory. I’d genuinely love hearing the result of that should anybody try it (So if your 2K logo is grey, I would appreciate it if you entertained my idea and gave it a go, worth a try, right?).\n\nI am yet to try to start a cross-platform game with somebody. Will edit this post with an update about that once I have. For some reason I’m  not expecting a smooth ride.\n\n  \nEDIT\n\nSo I managed to set up a cloud game with my partner who’s playing on their PC through steam. It runs pretty well. Takes a while to sync the saves/turns and the game restarts for each new turn, but I don’t have many complains about it and am kind of surprised it wasn’t more difficult than just.. setting it up as usual.

Solution may differ if from Epic or Steam.* \n\n**Game Center:**\n\nFirst and foremost, the connection to Civ6 servers requires Game Center. Without it, you're offline.

I’m here to talk about game development and the future direction of WWE2K. AMA! with +884 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/)\nI’ve been working in the video game industry for over 25 years, with detours into film, television, animation and coaching/organizational psychology. I believe that video games are art, profoundly influencing our culture, relationships, learning, creativity and social organization in ways we can barely conceive today. I recently joined Visual Concepts and 2K Games as Executive Producer of the WWE2K Sim franchise. The past three months have been a deep dive into professional wrestling games, the WWE2K franchise, WWE history, and the creative and passionate community of players with strong opinions about the direction of the franchise.

Certain moves make you slide to the left or right (or if your on the ground roll away)... please make every reversal have an actual counter to it (Sliding doesn’t count) Too many people can spam one move and then use one of the other “quick” moves to force you to reverse twice in a row. It’s extremely cheap and frustrating. Reversal Burner moves have run rampant throughout this game for YEARS. \n2. A spamming detection system needs to be in place. Unfortunately not all moves are created equal and the  harder to reverse moves can be spammed over and over again. Reward players to play more creatively and I think you’ll see people return to this game.\nAlso as a side note: I know people in leagues that love how cool some moves look but are afraid to use them because they do not want to get majored reversed in a game. Any game that makes you “afraid” to use a wrestling move needs to remove all major reversals. Also, in tornado tags - most leagues have a “respect the move” rule. It would be nice to have that as a option - for example if my partner is getting a move place on him I would be unable to break up the move. I would have to wait until the animation is complete before I could strike. Sometime just bumping into your own partner causes a move to get broken up. Please give me this option on future games.\n\n### Comment ID fs7tktf with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7tktf/) (in reply to ID fs7moub):\n[removed]\n\n#### Comment ID fs7vwag with +5 score by [(Neg_Crepe, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7vwag/) (in reply to ID fs7tktf):\n>optional GM features to universe mode?\n\nit needs to be a separated mode.

There are so many aspects of the game that probably require a lot more effort that it appears on the surface.  Delivering a giant roster, for example. Or being able to create your own superstar and add any of 9000 costume parts to customize him or her. To give you a sense of the complexity there, we use a system called \"fit tech\" to make all the CAS parts fit onto superstars of different sizes. Fit tech has a line of code for every word in the entire Harry Potter book series, plus 100,000 more!

Early on, I spent a ton of time with the creative director, and we went through a bunch of shows, PPV’s and such. I responded to a lot of it, and really wanted to synthesize into a unifying theme. Then, one day, I walked past his desk and he was watching some behind the scenes material that really focused on Bautista. I stopped in my tracks, and we spend the next hour or so scrubbing through material. I think the vision really emerged from those conversations—what’s it like to actually BE on the roster, to be a part of this spectacular entertainment? To describe this in terms of a \"vision\" I would say our goal is to focus a lot more on the superstar experience.\n\n#### Comment ID fs9ub5t with +29 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs9ub5t/) (in reply to ID fs7yfxr):\nYou son of a bitch, you're giving me hope.\n\n## Comment ID fs7mw06 with +82 score by [(GRAVEBE4SHAVE, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7mw06/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nAre you a wrestling fan? \n\nThe reason I ask is because the 2K20 dlc stuff had barely anything to do with wrestling and more wrestling freedom such as a more expansive CAW mode is what people really desire.\n\n### Comment ID fs7up5k with +85 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7up5k/) (in reply to ID fs7mw06):\nI consider myself a fan, but I can’t hold a candle to true long-time fans who are steeped in the history of professional wrestling, with multiple unfolding narratives and generations.

However recently I have become interested in wrestling again and was going to buy the most recent game at the time (2K19), however I thought the servers would go offline so I waited for 2K20, we know how that turned out. After that I thought the 2K franchise was just plain bad, and I wouldn't have a game that was like the ones I'd play when I was younger (SvR 2008-WWE13).\n\nBut, with the announcement of you taking over as executive producer, and then your continued engagement with fans I have hope again. So I guess I don't have any questions, just want to let you that I can't wait to see what the next game is going to be like. Also, I realise there is a ton of requests by fans on what should be in the next game which is great, just make sure it isn't bloated with content. Only add top stuff (in my opinion anyway, i'm not a game dev).\n\nThanks for sparing us your time!\n\n### Comment ID fs82lpc with +63 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs82lpc/) (in reply to ID fs7uxvx):\nThanks for that awesome comment!

For example, say both you and your opponent are heavily damaged in your match, and you hit your finisher. Instead of being able to immediately go for the pin, your wrestler has to recover and crawl his or her way over to the opponent, leading to more drama and more realism. Or possibly random injuries during matches in Universe and the highly requested GM mode, forcing you, the showrunner, to make a change of plans to a rivalry or title contendership?\n\n2) Any chance we could get more than 2 attire slots for custom wrestlers?\n\n3) The PS3/360 games had little to no trouble adding a custom music option, but it hasn't appeared since the jump to PS4/Xbone. Is this a WWE mandated decision or just something unable to be done on the console. I'm sure you're aware how disappointing it always is for a large number of users in the community who love using indy/classic wrestlers and they aren't able to import those wrestler's themes into the game. \n\nThanks for taking the time to answer the community!\n\n### Comment ID fs82fyn with +138 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs82fyn/) (in reply to ID fs7y0qt):\nCore gameplay is one of the major investments we’re making in the next installment—one of six pillars we are focused on disproportionately in development. We are looking at much-loved previous games like No Mercy or Smackdown: Here Comes the Pain, along with top franchise installments, and more modern wrestling and fighting games to build an all-new philosophical foundation for the game. People who hope that we holistically adopt the control scheme or philosophy from one of their favorite games are likely to be disappointed; we are trying to combine the best ideas out there into a brand new wrestling experience that sets a new standard.\n\nThe game play team is focused on Accessibility, Depth and Wrestling Experience. For Accessibility, we’re obsessed with a simple, intuitive interface which has meaning and depth in a wide variety of contexts—i.e. the game is a lot smarter about what the player is trying to do given a gameplay situation (in a grapple, on the ropes, against a turnbuckle, etc.), with consistent inputs regardless of situation. New players should be able to accidentally pull off awesome moves just by playing with and experimenting with controls.  \n\nFor Depth, we’re looking a lot at ring position, deeper combos and “working” moves, limb damage, technical capabilities, match momentum and unlocks, and rock-paper-scissors (RPS) strategies by archetype and player style. Depth doesn’t come from the manual skill of pressing the proper buttons but from the psychological game of anticipating and countering your opponent’s strategy, and this needs to be built in from the very foundation, so expect a significant evolution in gameplay with the next installment.\n\nThe last aspect of great gameplay is capturing the essence of professional wrestling, which has dimensions of drama, changing context, massive roster, backstage action, weapons and props, audience participation and spectacle. One of the huge challenges of the franchise is finding ways for players to feel in control of the vast number of potential outcomes in a given match. While we take lessons from fighting games, action RPG’s and other genres, this aspect helps us stay focused on delivering a through-and-through wrestling game. While we’re determined to deliver the spectacle and specific moments of a genuine match, I can say we’re trying to get away form UI popups or mini games to represent things like pins or reversals, and instead move those concepts into more fully-realized mechanics which feel like extensions of the main experience.\n\n#### Comment ID fs8mddi with +21 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs8mddi/) (in reply to ID fs82fyn):\nThis is the best thing I've read so far about what you guys are working towards.

At the five-month mark, the team had delivered six major patches (seven if you count the Day 1 patch), and four installments of downloadable content. We reached a point where the biggest issues we were seeing had to do with memory overruns with custom characters and arenas. Fixing these issues would require us to change file formats, branching our code in such a way that improvements to 2K20 wouldn’t carry forward into the next game (and could potentially invalidate existing community creations). We were also facing the reality that maintaining older code was preventing us from making bigger, more comprehensive changes that were required to set a new direction. Finally, given we had made the decision to skip a year before the next release, we had used almost half of the additional time we had to make the next project great.  \n\nWeighing all of this, and in discussion with the team leadership, I felt the best thing would be to turn our focus to the next project.

This new era of transparency is greatly appreciated.\n\nWith that being said, my impression of the feedback process prior to this new direction is that the advisors/influencers and the community would pass along their suggestions to the dev/design team through the feedback project and company events, but somewhere between the dev team and the ultimate decision makers was a disconnect that often left the community feeling unheard.\n\nWhile the new direction seems promising, what steps are being taken to ensure that the flow of ideas and feedback will ultimately impact the game. I guess in alternate terms, could you describe the planned feedback implementation process? How do you decide which features make it into the game and which ones to pass up for the time being? (In general terms as I understand specific features are kept secret until the “OK” is given)\n\nOnce again, thank you very much\n\n### Comment ID fs80tm1 with +44 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs80tm1/) (in reply to ID fs7moqz):\nGreat question. On our end, we’re doing some things I don’t think we’ve ever done before, including scraping feedback, and prioritizing according to mentions. We’re also sharing some of this back out to the community, so you’re seeing the same information we’re using to prioritize our development. Of course there are no guarantees that all feedback from the community makes it into the game. We have to fold community feedback in with development priorities, and more general research and feedback we use internally. Ultimately, the evidence will be in the game, but I can assure you we’re looking at player feedback more closely than ever.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID fs7tzy4 with +25 score by [(GlorioleJumper, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7tzy4/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nI was massively disappointed to see no cross generation support on the top requested feedback items for community creations. I love creating CAWs, but it’s so draining recreating the same guys year on year from scratch when the background infrastructure is the same. There’s no recreation support and it hurts at times, I.e. no scales or numbers to help recreate faces and bodies, it becomes so hard to match a face year on year. Items of clothing aren’t numbered or named and often move on the list. Movesets despite being the same in the background takes ages to replicate with no support.\n\nIs there any plan to introduce ways to help content creators import something/anything to the next game in the series to help support this? \n\nI love the creation suite, it’s just a huge shame and a drain to restart from scratch each and every year.\n\n### Comment ID fs82rem with +54 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs82rem/) (in reply to ID fs7tzy4):\nFrom the online producer:  As an online producer, the concept of cross platform community creations is exciting to us as well!

I think it's so significant to the entertainment form in general, and to the history of WWE. Isn’t that everyone’s?\n\nI don’t have as much to draw on for a favorite match as most fans, but I loved Edge vs. Orton at this past Wrestlemania. I thought they did the impossible, delivering that kind of intensity without an audience. \n\nFor storylines, I admit to a (maybe) bizarre fascination with The Undertaker, and the storylines and rivalries associated with him. \n\nLess of a storyline but a persona, I’ll say I think Finn Balor and the demon persona (with ties to Finn MacCool, and Balor, king of demons—Irish mythology I grew up with), are just phenomenal. I was also hugely impressed by Balor’s statement of inclusion at Wrestlemania 34. In spite of how exotic the demon persona is, I think Balor reaches levels of authenticity few other superstars can touch.

What is the team doing to make this the Undisputed Wrestling Game Champion hands down compared to all the other new wrestling games coming out.  2K games have been around for over 20 years so you guys can't be out done by startups.\n2. I know people want features, match types, ect. but is the team looking at the bread and butter of a true wrestling game? Improving gameplay, AI, collision, hit detection, targeting.   I look at past games like SVR 2006 being pretty good at AI and even 2019 was decent  but 2020 seems like a big step backwards and AI is just a punching bag.  I hope all of this is prioritize high because no matter the features, match types, modes, it's all for nothing if gameplay and AI is bad. \n\ntx\n\n### Comment ID fs840sr with +32 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs840sr/) (in reply to ID fs7tdjf):\nWe're focused on making a great game, not thinking too much about the other new wrestling games coming out.

(Gauntlet,Casket,War Games,street fight,Special Guest Referee , Winner Takes All ,Buried Alive,Ambulance,K.O.T.R, Fight pit,strap,etc.)\n\n2.How likely could you guys implement a feature where we could use our own custom music for our superstars entrances? (Basically using Spotify)\n\n3.Is it possible to be able to create our own stories and be able to upload them to community creations for others to download and be able to use?\n\n4.Since other games have been implementing crossplay, could we see that implemented into community creations and online mode?\n\n5.Can you please have NO limit on how many superstars/other things you can download in a day and also,NO limit on the amount of superstars/other things you can download from community creations completely not just in a day Just get rid of them entirely please? The reason I say this because for many years community creations would have a limit to how many you things you can  download and it ruins the whole point on being able to download creator’s superstars and other creations when there is a limit\n\n6.Is the expectation that you guys are looking to massively change how the next Wwe2k game will be on the next generation consoles since your game will most likely release a year after they release or are  you guys expecting it to just be a port to next gen with basically nothing new but maybe slight improvements?\n\n### Comment ID fs7xrnn with +70 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7xrnn/) (in reply to ID fs7mxs2):\nMatch types are derived from AI logic, physics, arena layout and other elements which then get crafted into rulesets for specific matches.  We are putting a ton of emphasis on core gameplay at the moment, and will need to rebuild match types based upon our new systems.

However, I feel like an important question that should be asked is, have you guys played any of the older non 2K WWE titles such as the SVR titles, No Mercy, Here Comes the Pain, Day of Reckoning, etc. as well as the older 2K titles from 14-19? If so which one was your favorite, what was your favorite mode and why did you enjoy it so much?\n\n\nMy second question is that I saw in the thread you started about the face morphing and create a superstar that your sir has been playing the games and have been creating in the various modes. What new features/improvements have you yourself wanted to add to the game and what is something that the community is asking for that you feel should be added. One of my favorite modes is create a title and I have had an idea for you guys to do a sort of 3D emboss tool that would allow flat images to become 3D, with the edge color of the image being the color for the shapes sides in the 3d space. This would allow for us to take flat pictures and make new belt plates to match new ones that appear on TV that may have a unique shape not seen in any of the templates of create a title.\n\nFinally #3, will 2k20 get ANYMORE UPDATES. I mainly play 19 but I know there are many who still play 20 and would love to hear any kind of news regarding this.\n\nThanks again!\n\n### Comment ID fs7zjhe with +65 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7zjhe/) (in reply to ID fs7mz87):\nFrom a Design Lead:\nMany of us on the team have been playing wrestling games dating back to the days of the NES. We actually have a N64 and GameCube in the office and will occasionally play No Mercy, Day of Reckoning 2 & Ultimate Muscle (AKI's last wrestling game).\nAKI's output on the N64 are some of my personal favorites as they were mechanically sound games that were more accessible than many other wrestling options that have come before & even after. The AKI games also did a fantastic job capturing the spirit of wrestling and had an incredible roster.\nIn terms of modes, very few games have achieved the open-ended nature and freedom of Here Comes The Pain. That's a personal favorite. SvR 2009 and 2010 Road to Wrestlemania's were great as well as they really embraced the theater of wrestling.\n\n#### Comment ID fs81rx0 with +29 score by [(kiwiguy187, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs81rx0/) (in reply to ID fs7zjhe):\nThe match physics in smackdown vs raw 2011 were the best in the series. The freedom of movement when executing moves was unparalleled and only featured in that game. Lift a guy up with any move and you had total 360° choice where they landed.\nIt also applied to the weapons too. You could place a weapon down or lean it anywhere you wanted.\nSeriously look at or even play TLC matches in 2011.

After 1 match he didn't want to play anymore. Said \"slow as molasses and the controls are too complicated\". \n\n1. Is there any talks of addressing that?\n\n2. Anybody who plays seriously would only use Reversal and Resiliency for paybacks. Maybe Finisher. Can we do away with that whole Payback idea, or balance it better?\n\n3. Every match seems designed to encourage a 30 minute Gargano vs Cole classic. Is there any talks of modifying so that a match can end more unexpectedly?\n\n4. It's way too annoying to do any \"zany\" antics. Like shenanigans when the ref is out. Or putting someone through a table. Is any of this to be addressed?\n\n### Comment ID fs83ohw with +32 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs83ohw/) (in reply to ID fs7yceu):\nGreat question, and thanks for sharing that personal experience.  I posted earlier about some of the comprehensive changes we're making to gameplay. It's still early days, but our initial results are super encouraging. To your second question, we're taking a hard look at how reversals work, to create a reversal system that's more deeply integrated with the overall flow of combat.  We're also looking at match length, and systems which allow for shorter, more dominating matches. Regarding four, we're looking at all aspects of core combat, so expect improvements there as well.\n\n## Comment ID fs7ohot with +17 score by [(the905guy11, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7ohot/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nWill you do open and honest during development of the next 2K game?

You seem to legitimately care about what we want in this community. I have a few questions, if you’re able to answer them that’s great. Thank you!\n\n1. Was there a reason it took 12+ years (5 during 2K’s takeover) to at least acknowledge that a wide portion of the fan base have wanted and begged for a GM mode? It felt like it was purposely ignored until you stepped in.\n\n2. What’s stopping 2K from releasing monthly/quarterly updates that include things like new wrestlers, updated characters models and even things like championships and move sets and putting them out as DLC? I can understand that the wrestling games are supposed to take place during a time period, so if you keep them updated the end of 2K19’s roster would just be 2K20’s starting roster, but what about when it comes to certain situations like someone getting a new haircut or entirely new gimmick right when the game comes out?\n\n3. In future MyCareer modes, can it be possible that we use wrestlers who are already in the game instead of a custom character? Some people just don’t enjoy using someone that isn’t real. That’s why some people prefer a Season Mode or Road to WrestleMania.\n\nPS. I’m sure a lot of us miss the roster reveals SummerSlam weekend that show actual character models and small clips from the persons entrance when announcing they made they cut. Instead of what’s been going on lately where it’s just a bunch of text dropped on a website. Just a little thing if you’ve never heard of them doing it back when THQ was around, it was a really cool.\n\nThank you for doing this again, we all appreciate you here!\n\n## Comment ID fs7vhev with +21 score by [(TonyPizzaGuyYT, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7vhev/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nI know you are new to the franchise, but why hasn’t online been a focus of the WWE 2K franchise?

I feel like the big disconnect between the consumer and devs is that we as fans get so excited for what will be in the game coming up, but we literally do not hear a single word about the game until June, and wait till a month before release to even get a full roster. We hear almost nothing about new features (which have been lacking since the switch to new gen but that’s for a different time) and we literally get 0 communication which i feel causes a huge problem because what we expect or want, never even happens, but i feel like it could be fixed with proper communication between devs, and fan base. \n\nAs i’m sure you’re aware the weekly product is constantly changing, it would also be nice if we got updated attires, entrances, moves etc instead of waiting a whole year to try out some things. this could also be addressed by allowing us to use Spotify or uploaded MP3’s in the game for entrance music, and allowing us to use the edit superstar feature to edit a superstars likeness completely. \n\nAlso I urge you guys to please try and capture the feel of a WWE show in the games. I would never know i’m at WrestleMania doing Hogan vs Austin because of how dead the game feels. Even the most simple wrestling things like strike sequences, and proper chain wrestling aren’t in the game. I really hope these things can be fixed especially if this game is going to be called a simulator. \n\nThanks for doing the AMA btw man, so far you’ve been so awesome about interacting with us and showing a true interest in our franchise!\n\n### Comment ID fs88nwq with +25 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs88nwq/) (in reply to ID fs7o9my):\nI hear you on the updates to development. As a fan of other franchises, I know I love to have a constant flow of information that lets me know what's happening in development. We have a commitment to improve on that front for the coming game, so expect to get a lot more insight along the way. At the same time, if I'm honest, there are times when we really have to be heads down creating the game, and have less time than we'd like to have a dialog with the community. I'll also say that we want to hold some things back, and this is primarily to make the experience of some key reveals as thrilling as we can. Ultimately, we want to create an experience for players that extends outside the boundaries of the game.\n\n## Comment ID fs7woid with +14 score by [(davereveiws255, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7woid/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nJust 2 questions sir!\n1.

I love professional wrestling in general in the unique way it spans the globe, and merges sports and athletic competition with big personalities, storytelling, and drama, all of which translates really well to games.  At its core, it's takes elements of the best genres of video games, combat, story telling, drama, and spectacle. A good WWE game offers the experience of BEING the Superstar, not observing the Superstar. Every decision and movement can feel important and visceral. The approach to the next WWE 2K franchise game will view WWE as a real competition, with high stakes, pain, rivalries and drama and we want the player to feel invested in all of it.\n\n## Comment ID fs7nf71 with +24 score by [(LemonFoxyTasty, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7nf71/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\n1.

When the audio team talks about what they’re trying to achieve with Commentary, you get a ton of domain-specific lingo, like beer tasting or something (except that instead of “catty” or “resinous” or “malt backbone,” you hear terms like “move call” or “grunt harvest” or “one-shot”). To give you an idea of the scope and complexity, Move Calls, for example, have over 44,000 unique calls. A simple move call like, *“Big hit there by The Rock!”* might be three seconds. If that’s the average across all calls, that would represent about 36 hours of audio, maybe 10-12 days in a recording studio with months of dialog editing and implementation after that.

Certain moves make you slide to the left or right (or if your on the ground roll away)... please make every reversal have an actual counter to it (Sliding doesn’t count) Too many people can spam one move and then use one of the other “quick” moves to force you to reverse twice in a row. It’s extremely cheap and frustrating. Reversal Burner moves have run rampant throughout this game for YEARS. \n2. A spamming detection system needs to be in place.

It’s one of the biggest questions I asked when I first started. Basically, “Is it theater, or is it sport?” In all our discussions, we came down on the side of sport. We want to focus on the authenticity of rivalries, athleticism, and the experience of being a superstar, locked into meaningful combat in front of an audience of thousands.  \n\nWhen we describe the core focus of the next game, we sometimes use the phrase, “Step out of the crowd, step into the ring.” This reflects an effort to move a little bit away from the audience/broadcast experience, and toward the superstar experience. This central focus can affect our approach to almost every aspect of the game. We hope it produces the most authentic wrestling game ever!\n\n#### Comment ID fs9d7ua with +6 score by [(ColonelKnowsAll, Reddit, 2020-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs9d7ua/) (in reply to ID fs7v46h):\nFrom a wrestler-in-training perspective, the only way to make the superstar experience truly authentic would be to treat wrestling as theater.\n\n### Comment ID fs7p8jo with +6 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7p8jo/) (in reply to ID fs7mv3y):\n[deleted]\n\n## Comment ID fs7nyvu with +9 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7nyvu/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID fs7zngc with +42 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7zngc/) (in reply to ID fs7nyvu):\nWe are planning to leverage physics and object interactions more heavily than ever in the next installment!\n\n#### Comment ID fs824tc with +6 score by [(kiwiguy187, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs824tc/) (in reply to ID fs7zngc):\nThis more than anything makes me excited 2011 was the benchmark in gameplay physics.

The past two cycles we have made progress on a new foundation to build on, and we're focused on expanding content to support more situations in our next title. As for crowd, we are currently updating our crowd systems to sound fuller and more responsive to specific action taking place.\n\nAddressing repetition in content is a major focus for the commentary team and something we're excited about as it's a major part of bringing realism to the experience and a more organic representation of broadcast. Both interruption and branching commentary elements, along with repetition in content is a major focus for the next title.\n\n#### Comment ID fs875us with +16 score by [(coreyputney, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs875us/) (in reply to ID fs86pkf):\nThis is excellent, thank you so much.

Over the years, we've seen almost all of the past hairstyles from the in-game female superstars added to the creation suite (2K15 into 2K16, 2K16 into 2K17) but over the years the number has gotten smaller and smaller and we come to see a lack of new exciting additions to the creation suite. Creating women, in my opinion as well as the communities, is a far more tedious process than other creative aspects due to the fine details from hair, to make up to their intricate ring gear. Will we see any new developments and new ways to utilize and maximize the creation suite for women in the future?\n\n### Comment ID fs81uir with +28 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs81uir/) (in reply to ID fs7xw0x):\nThe character creation suite is getting a ton of focus for the next iteration.

I guess no one does an AMA without a couple kicks to the shins. \n\nI joined the team several months after WWE2K20 shipped, so I might not have a satisfying answer to that question. Having said that, I’m deeply sympathetic and impressed with the level of effort and dedication that went into the game. Game development is not an exact science. There are tons of projections, estimations and tradeoffs that don’t always come together the way you hoped. Often—very often, actually—the primary tension is between the ambition you have for a project, and your ability to achieve the full scope of that ambition. I think 2K20 had a very ambitious team that was passionate about delivering something awesome—and big—to the community.  \n\nI can tell you that I believe this team has an amazing game in them. At every level, and in every discipline, I’ve met and gotten to work with people I consider to be true experts in their craft.

Small updates from devs showing sneak peaks of it would be good even.\n\n## Comment ID fs7pi56 with +2 score by [(the905guy11, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7pi56/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nIs the goal to take an entire year off or to change the release date?

Like every superstars current theme and the one before it for people who like to do older gimmicks.)\n\n-Option to select a hairstyle previously used on a character, I know that adding major changes to a character is hard to get the license to do but this could be a way to also fix that (example Seth Rollins hair options could be his current hair, his Shield hairstyle with the blonde, etc.)\n\n-Customize make up color for in game superstars (a color slider would be useful here. I use Maryse a lot and kinda hate that dark lipstick...give us the option to make it different colors)\n\n-Create a manager entrance (I would like to have a custom entrance for my manager and I but you can't select the managers to put on a team and make one. I think that a manager entrance option would be great. Also more intergender entrances would be awesome too. \n\n-No exclusive entrances!

I’m just wondering if the team is carrying on using the same engine that has been in use for a few years now with incremental upgrades each year or if you’ll be building a new engine?\n\n2. Have you ever thought about bringing in something like NaturalMotion’s Euphoria engine to make the physics that bit more realistic?\n\n3. How possible is it to include occasional updates to superstars in the next game to keep them up to date? Not being a developer or really knowing much that goes into it all apart from the basics that most know I wonder how much of a hassle say sending someone out to a WWE show and say scanning someone’s new tattoo or freshly shaved head and then adding them in say a monthly update to keep the models somewhat up to date. I think we all remember Baron Corbin shaving his head like a few weeks of 2k19 coming out and having that “well sh*t” reaction knowing we’d have to wait a year to see the little change come into effect\n\nThanks for taking the time to listen to the community, it really shows you’re properly getting stuck in and taking feedback to heart 👍🏻\n\n## Comment ID fs838tq with +2 score by [(ACaulkGoblin, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs838tq/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nNot sure if this is over with or not, but Hey Patrick my name is Nate, I’m one of the mods here and a huge fan of pro wrestling and wrestling video games. I grew up constantly drawing wrestling stages on schoolwork, paper, etc. so when the WWE games allowed for us to start to actually build our own arenas, to say I was ecstatic is an understatement. I was disappointed 19 didn’t offer any new stage parts, as the same with 20. To me it almost feels that Create An Arena is the ugly step child of the creation suite. Going forward will Create An Arena have less restrictions, and more to it?

That way, every match you play feels different and keeps you wanting to try new things to see more surprises.\n\nSame for weapons - more natural, spontaneous and organic options with tables, ladders, chairs, etc. With social media being as big as it is, people want to make highlight reels of dope spots on YouTube and Instagram but when they're all pre-programmed into the game and not random and exciting, they don't feel special.\n\nAny plans to fix this?\n\n### Comment ID fsenhzd with +2 score by [(Guitar1995, Reddit, 2020-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fsenhzd/) (in reply to ID fs7os4p):\nI couldn't agree more.

A good example of this type of content is the biggest WWE Games channel out there, ElementGames. Without highlight reel, Element wouldn't be able to create the truly unique and captivating content that has made him stand out from everyone else.\n\nThis is a mode that will make innovations one year and then have those innovations taken away the next. Example: 2K18 > 2K19, the amount of time you could record in HR was increased and the \"slow mode\" preview we were getting was fixed. 2K19 > 2K20, those innovations were just completely taken away and we ended up with a worse version than the 2K18 one. \n\nGames like Fortnite are expanding their player base because they have such an in-depth HR/theater mode. It naturally draws the creative types to the game when there are tools to use to make unique content.\n\nWhat does the future hold for Highlight Reel in the WWE 2K series?\n\n\\- BrokenFunBash\n\n## Comment ID fs7qiit with +2 score by [(daddymeltzer, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7qiit/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nI have a few questions\n\n1.

Will there be match types to match the current WWE events such as the Boneyard Match or the WWE HQ Money in the Bank\n\n5.  Will CM Punk be in the next game?\n\n6. Will you be able to edit pre existing wrestlers haircuts and facial hair in creation mode?\n\n7. Is it possible to implement Championship entrances into advanced entrances?\n\n8. While I love the simulation style of 2k19, I also loved the arcade style and match freedom of older WWE games would it be it possible to have more freedom in matches, such as jumping off a helicopter like in HCTP or freely climbing on tables without OMG Moves? Combining the simulation style of current WWE games with the arcade style of older WWE games could potentially make 2k22 the best wrestling game ever.\n\n9.

Are you going to do everything that you can in order to give that to us? Because let’s face it this community can eat you up and spit you out. We all just want an enjoyable game with features that we’ve been craving for for years and we haven’t gotten them.\n\nGM Mode, an In Depth Career Mode (we’ve gotten that bitch it’s just not what we thought it should be), missing match types, a Universe Mode that’s Playable and so much more.\n\nAll I want to ask is that if there is going to be a version for the next consoles that’ll be out for almost a year when this next game (assuming it’ll be WWE 2K22) comes out.\n\nThere’s no excuse as to why it wouldn’t be because of the consoles are out for almost a year you’d hourly be looking at that engine.\n\nAlso another question I have is that can you please make the commentary better? I keep hear Michael Cole, Byron Saxton, and Cory Graves say the same lines over and over again and it’s not even realistic! I hit a DDT and Cole called it a suplex. That’s not even the same move.\n\nAnd another question is can you please make the crowd more electric? The Crowd in WWE 2K19 & 20 from what I’ve heard is after like 10-15 minutes in a match (if it lasts that long) the crowd goes completely silent till you hit a signature or finisher. And then they pop for it but then goes dead silent after that move is done. The crowds at a WWE Event aren’t silent as I have been apart of many WWE Crowds when they have come to CT. So please fix this issue.\n\nOh and one more question is can you please update WWE 2K19 with the WWE 2K20 Superstars? I know that’ll take a lot of work but let’s face it... no one plays WWE 2K20 any more. It’s unplayable. An updated WWE 2K19 with the roster, arenas, and more would not only make me happy but a ton of people in the WWE Games Community happy as well.\n\nI want to thank you for all you have done so far keeping us in the loop when it comes to this upcoming installment in the WWE2K Franchise. You’re already doing leaps and bounds better than any other person in 2K as they have been hiding stuff from us for years. You keep us informed and we will show love back. It’s that simple.

My request in this case is for clothes for the created wrestlers \\^\\_\\^\n\n## Comment ID fs7sml5 with +1 score by [(brouski, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7sml5/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nWhat's the likelihood of getting mini-updates throughout the year, paid or otherwise, with updates to existing wrestlers with gimmick changes (Themes, trons, attires, entrances, etc.)\n\n## Comment ID fs7sqsx with +1 score by [(eastcoastkody, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7sqsx/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nWhat are ur thoughts on consolidating modes.

I'm an actual ring announcer & I would love the opportunity to truly give fans the most immersive/in depth announcing experience ever. I truly feel and belive that the ring announcing in wwe games SHOULD ALWAYS be done with 100% maximum effort, & even extra special at ppv events like Royal Rumble, Wrestlemania, SummerSlam, Survivor Series etc. I promise you that if given the chance I would absolutely & unequivocally provide the best possible experience ever in that regard in wwe games, further more my objectives would be to make sure the players feel as if they're at an actual event. No two intros of the same person or anyone else would ever be exactly the same. Everything should be unique and have it's on special feeling. Just look at my you tube page GoldenTalkTv....my work speaks for itself. Thank you so much for your time and have a fantastic day and stay safe! \n\nP.S.

The originals idea was awful to be honest, I've had the series every year for 23 years and that was the worst addition I have seen. What people want is a better creation suite, gm mode (this is the biggest one) and the old match types like buried alive, inferno etc. back in the franchise, I'd say those are the big ones. Also why is there no guitar weapon anymore!?! Elias is in the game and that should be Incentive enough to have a guitar added. Last thing, the controls.

That they pushed WWE Originals as this big groundbreaking feature, but it wasn't a part of the actual game. It was DLC. It was pre-planned paid content that you didn't get with the actual full price of game. So the game was basically no different than the previous years outside of a new story mode. I think it was a very cheap tatic to get people to spend more on the game. \n\nI'm an old school gamer so I feel that DLC should complement the main game, not be the biggest feature you want to play. That would be like bringing GM mode back but as DLC. Going forward what are your plans with additional content that is paid for dlc. Will it be for main features or for things like updated looks/etc?\n\n## Comment ID fs81nhq with +1 score by [(childishboyjay, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs81nhq/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nNow i doubt a lot if focus would be put in 2k19 but will there be more updates to 2k20\nBlood\nUniverse crashing\nVideo creator crashing\nMy online match crashed once\nThere are certain points in a match where someone kicks out and rises like the undertaker while the other  person is frustrated for the pin\nMore creation slots maybe??? \nAn 2006 john cena would be nice\nA 2006 kane\n\n## Comment ID fs81qqz with +1 score by [(Abdi-Omar, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs81qqz/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nHi Patrick can we keep the Concept of keeping Attires from previous games going into Next Gen Consoles since WWE 2K15 this has been one of the best things about the Creation Suite for many years for example all of AJ Styles Attires from his previous games dating back to his debut in 2K17 are all in WWE 2K20 this allows us to freshen up his Look when we so choose with a variety of options without having to rely on Community Creations this has been a great tool for current gen and it would be great to continue maintaining it\n\n## Comment ID fs81r1y with +1 score by [(ECKO_MARTiNEZ, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs81r1y/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nAre you guys using any older wrestling video games or wwe stars that play the game like Xavier woods on what they think could improve in today’s games?

Just got two questions for the time being:\n\n1. With 2K21 being skipped over for the more arcadey Battlegrounds this year, is the plan as is right now to do a WWE 2K game every two years to give more development time, or is this just a one time thing for now with the plan to go back to a WWE 2K simulation every year?\n\n\n2. With the overall legends selection within the WWE 2K franchise shrinking the last two years, was just curious about the process of selecting or signing legends for these games. Is getting legends something is responsible for getting independently with a fixed budget where guys like Hogan just take up more money to sign and so cuts are needed?

Is there ways where we can realistically have ways in which we can include superstars as in gear types/styles , hair , Makeup , accessories , I know it’s a lot of work to include superstars as it takes time but have you guys thought about this alternative? We would also love a better creation suite with multiple fabric/material types , better clothing options in which we have full control , we should have control over the way we want gears to fit (tight , baggy , slim , length , style) not only that , the hairstyles should be more customizable in which we can control the length , size , & overall look when it’s placed on a superstar! Lastly , as a personal problem I’ve had , I would like more space when it comes to image uploading into the game and an easier way to import other content when other creators upload gears , we should have an option to copy and paste without actually having to go into create a superstar and changing the gear to ring attire/manager attire!

I love to play wwe games online. I especially loved wwe 2k14. \n1. Can we see an adjustment to reversals? Especially any form of major reversals? On paper. It sounds good. But Ppl cheese them. So they do a finisher and pin. No skill needed. And most likely win. It’s the meta of online play. I hate I have to do that. Can we see major reversal ether adjusted or completely removed in the future games? Unblockable attacks work in other fighting games. Just not in WWE games.\n\n2. Also for online. Make it so reversals limits are the same. Or gone. I hate being a normal superstar with 3 bars. Just to fight a guy who put six reversal bars in his character.\n\n3. Remove the hud for the opponent so I can’t see what’s his momentum and vice versa. So when finishers occur. It’s a surprise. And not coz I saw they had it stored. Older wwe games like WWE 2k14 did this perfectly.\n\n## Comment ID fs85ahs with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs85ahs/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nThanks for doing this AMA Patrick, just one quick question.\n\nWill we be seeing some sort of cross-play integration between the different consoles and PC in time for the next WWE game?\n\n## Comment ID fs85jj9 with +1 score by [(Otb_liljosh13, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs85jj9/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nRoad to wrestlemania online, gm mode online?

First I just want to say thanks a ton for being transparent with the community and wanting to improve the games. My question is will the gameplay be more like Here Comes the Pain? What I mean is more arcade like. What I loved about the PS2 era of games was that even non wrestling fans could even local multiplayer due to the crazy stuff you could do. I haven't been a fan of the sim gameplay. Also in regards to a season mode, could we have sometjing like Here Comes The Pain? I miss the random encounters and replayablity.

Can we get accurate versions of wrestlers for what they used to look like. For example Kurt Angle '06 and Kurt Angle '01 simply just has hair on his head another issue is that both Kurt Angle character models are using Kurt Angle's recent face scan this really throws off the authenticity and experience of the game. We basically end up with a character model that's supposedly supposed to look like what they looked like from the year 2001 using a recent face scan and we end up with a product that's off you can still see the aging of the wrestlers. Samething with The Rock and The Rock '01 he simply just has hair on his head and you can still see the aging on the younger model aswell. We want these characters designed from the ground up because we obviously can't get or use a face scan. Can we also get more retro wrestlers like retro Thuganomics Cena retro Here Comes the Pain Brock Lesnar. Debut of retro American badass biker Undertaker the best version of the biker Undertaker in the year 2000 that version of him in WWE 2K14 and in SmackDown 1 and 2. Batista from his Evolution days and his Smackdown days when he had hair.

I hope these are more questions than they are just me hawking my suggestions, but you know how it goes on these things.\n\n1) Are there any plans to make the wrestler AI feel more unique and individualized? When I'm fighting Rey Mysterio, or when I'm fighting the Big Show, I don't see any big difference in tactics or match flow besides the stats and the moveset. But sim sports games have always had stuff like tendencies, and at least some percentage of WWE games players are also Fire Pro World players, which gives you an unbelievable amount of customization on enemy wrestler AI/what AI vs. AI matches will look like. I also think old PS2 era WWE games got around this okay by making extremely  exaggerated animations of signature moves for the stars (Rock, Lesnar, Goldberg etc). For me, it seemed wild that people were getting up in arms about not getting to play as Lio Rush in 2K20 when playing as/against Stone Cold Steve Austin hasn't been exciting in 15 years.\n\n2) Any plans for create a story? I know it was supposed to be buggy/laggy in the X360/PS3 generation, but I think it would have been such a big hit with streaming. IIRC the VGCW guys got big right before Twitch became a thing, then the next versions of the game got rid of CAS. I can see the potential problems with content moderation, etc.\n\n## Comment ID fs7p4ns with +1 score by [(FrancisTB45, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7p4ns/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nAre there plans for a future general manager feature in the next-gen consoles?\n\n## Comment ID fs7p4oc with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7p4oc/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nIn regards to tag teams, factions, and other groups -- why do past teams not get included as entrances (moves, music, etc.), presentation and everything to do with teams feels like no one cares?\n\nFor instance, X-Pac is included in 2K20, but there is no Kane & X-Pac entrance.

The outdated designs are disgusting.\n\nMusic choice in CaE, the generic music is mediocre and the lack of spotify/on disk integration is disappointing. I used to use music from older talent for my CAWs to help them stand out from the on disck ones.\n\nAnimations in CaE, not enough generic entrance templates. Give us generic angry entraces or calculating entrances. Shouldn't be too hard to sit down with a couple of wrestlers and mocap out 20 - 30 different entrances. Also when you are splicing different entrace sets from different wrestlers it would be amazing if it could somehow apply some kind of AI and smooth the entrance out if  I combine say Brock on the ring, orton on the ramp and black into the ring for an example.\n\n## Comment ID fs7q8u1 with +1 score by [(chiraledge, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7q8u1/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nFavorite WWE game story/season/etc mode?

Do you consider it a priority?  It hasn't really been touched in the last 15 years and is one of the blandest parts of the gameplay.  It's whoever can move their bar in the right direction or mash buttons the fastest.  There is so much more strategy to submissions in real life and so much that could be improved upon.

This a concern of mine since polling showed this very low. I am hoping this will be addressed as the possibility of full body morphing being added brings the concern of disturbing creations that I do not want to see, and I am also concerned children should not see. The second question is in regard to whether or not someone  on the WWE 2k team or with some of the power users would do some basic tutorials on how each of the create a modes function. Personally I think if you do they should posted on a 2k resource page somewhere. Finally regarding Spotify if you are to do a Spotify integration would you need premium to use it?

So iv a number of questions but feel free to answer any ones you like\n1) Will the focus just be next gen(PS5 etc) going forward? I personally feel like this is necessarily because of how much work the game needs and I would worry that cross gen development will hinder development\n2) My Career has not exactly been a success and I was wondering if it will be continuing or get replaced? Preferably with a season mode or some sort\n3) For me Universe mode has been the most important mode because of longevity and as a single player gamer I hope there can continue to being long term single player modes going forward, I sometimes feel like the games focus does more so be on short term modes like Showcase/MyCareer story/2KOriginals etc and was hoping that will change going forward\n4) is there any plans to rebuild the game from the ground up because the engine has been pretty flawed in the past? Kind of links to my Q1 as to why I hope the focus in next gen going forward as the game needs a lot of work.\n5) Something more light hearted but have you any favourite Wrestling games yourself and any particular feature/mode that you yourself want to bring to the game?\n\n## Comment ID fs7sslb with +1 score by [(Mintydeadman, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7sslb/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nWhen is WWE 2k19 going back on sale?

There's a lot of legends to choose from, especially in 2K18.

      "# Post ID 13l4bow: EA Sports PGA Tour v/s PGA 2K23 with +56 score by [(seabterry, Reddit, 2023-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsPGATour/comments/13l4bow/ea_sports_pga_tour_vs_pga_2k23/)\nAs I have commented before. I purchased and started playing 2K23 after my Career in EA PGA Tour got the freeze glitch and I can’t progress anymore. I do still come back for the Daily and Weekly Tournaments. Here are my thoughts/comparisons:\n\n1: 2K23 just feels every bit of ARCADE style. I know the people on their subreddit think it’s a simulator and EA’s game is Arcade, but I found it was exactly the opposite. I play EA on 3 Click Swing in my Career with the AI on 40 or 50. I play the quick play in Career so I’m used to going 4 rounds and playing 6-8 holes per round. That feels much more real to life and I score close to everyone near the top. I have only won maybe 3 tournaments in Career on EA. In my 2K23 Career I play on Normal difficulty and one full round per tournament and yesterday I stored -18 on 18 holes. I have won almost every tournament I’ve played and each round (18 holes) takes 20 minutes max. It feels just like a video game. Once you figure out where to hit the ball and account for roll, you can use an iron or wedge and get without 2’ of the hole EASILY. \n\n2: EA has the graphics. 2K23 isn’t terrible, but EA is a  clear winner.\n\n3: EA’s Career mode is head and shoulders better than 2K23. They have the courses and it feels like a real PGA Tour. 2K feels like a “fake” tour with mostly fake courses. On a related note, 2K23 has the user created courses and those are always a plus. \n\n4: I really enjoy 2K23’s progression. The season pass is a great idea that gives great content. Your golfer levels up faster, but not too fast. You feel like after every game you get something for it. \n\n5: Another check in EA’s column is their grass and green speeds and elevation changes. 2K23 feels like every course is a similar speed and there is no accounting for elevation. It might be small, but it’s enough to take me out of the game. \n\n6: I could be wrong but 2K23’s ball physics seem comical. The bounces and the rolls seem like something from Mario Golf or similar style golf game. \n\n7: I haven’t ran into one bug in 2K23. In EA, I’ve been stopped in Career due to that bug that won’t let you progress and also it froze up on Hole 1 in a Seasonal Tournament…so there went my tickets on my entry fee. \n\nIn conclusion, if my career had not been stopped in EA, I might have never played 2K23 or been able to make this comparison. I still prefer EA, but I have no problems playing both. I’m getting 2 different experiences and I enjoy things from both. I would rather play a sim than an arcade, so EA is my preference. Honestly, 2K has good ideas and a seemingly more stable experience and you can play 18 holes quickly if you are pressed for time. With my EA career being on a standstill, I reach for 2K23 more RIGHT NOW, but EA is clearly the better game FOR ME.\n\n## Comment ID jkomcjm with +18 score by [(TinCrud1, Reddit, 2023-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsPGATour/comments/13l4bow/ea_sports_pga_tour_vs_pga_2k23/jkomcjm/) (in reply to ID 13l4bow):\nI'm not going to go into comparing these two games as it's been done to death. I will just say that IMO we have never had two golf games that are this good out at the same time. They are both excellent and both have positives and negatives. \n\nNo matter what your preferred game is we should be promoting both games and if you can afford it, buy both games. We need to have these two games competing to one up each other so we can get the best golf games that we can get. We all unfortunately know what happens when a sports game has no competition.\n\n### Comment ID kavr90k with +5 score by [(HoldenZ22, Reddit, 2023-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsPGATour/comments/13l4bow/ea_sports_pga_tour_vs_pga_2k23/kavr90k/) (in reply to ID jkomcjm):\nMadden??

They need to bring back NBA live and ALL EA big titles\n\n#### Comment ID mczg5bo with +1 score by [(SurpriseEquivalent70, Reddit, 2025-02-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsPGATour/comments/13l4bow/ea_sports_pga_tour_vs_pga_2k23/mczg5bo/) (in reply to ID le7ef19):\nAnd after playing cfb25 since release we can even take it off the list of good games ea made,lol,dynasty sucks the a.i. is so scripted it ruins the game\n\n### Comment ID k70hyx5 with +1 score by [(DontTellThemItoldya, Reddit, 2023-10-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsPGATour/comments/13l4bow/ea_sports_pga_tour_vs_pga_2k23/k70hyx5/) (in reply to ID jkomcjm):\nThis guy gets it.\n\n## Comment ID jkqevtf with +8 score by [(Kelson64, Reddit, 2023-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsPGATour/comments/13l4bow/ea_sports_pga_tour_vs_pga_2k23/jkqevtf/) (in reply to ID 13l4bow):\nUltimately, I really enjoy both games - and I've easily gotten my money's worth out of both of them.\n\n## Comment ID jkppqef with +6 score by [(RecentCollection1258, Reddit, 2023-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsPGATour/comments/13l4bow/ea_sports_pga_tour_vs_pga_2k23/jkppqef/) (in reply to ID 13l4bow):\nMy take.. mixed feelings..\nI have played a lot of TGC19, 2k21 and 2k23. I enjoyed the games a lot but I was really itching for a new EA game. I missed the presentation and gameplay of the old Tiger games. I was very pleased with the graphics, announcers and presentation, damn good!! I got the  nostalgia bug right back when I played with the power boost, spin and heartbeat moments on. I had fun playing a few challenges and the career mode is great. I then turned off the arcade mode and had fun with the tour settings for more of a challenge. It was hard at first judging the roll on long approach shots and spin on pitching shots. But the flop and pick shots were very easy. This is where it stated to change a bit.\n\nWhile it was fun building my players ratings I found the game get more stale as my player got better in the mid 80s. A lot of shots became automatic and the career mode that I loved at first is starting to get old. I only really struggle when the winds are high. Playing with the pros got old quick too unfortunately. The 3 click is a fun alternative in short bunches. \n\nIf you would of asked me 3 weeks ago I would have said hands down EA is a better game. I even went back to 2k early on to compare and thought so. But I was in love with the presentation and course detail EA put in. It is fantastic! And 2ks swing timing has often been infuriating to me. It feels inconsistent, my controller wouldn't be in sync, on my series s I often have to restart the game to get my controller/swing timing to work correctly. Had to do the same on my ps4 with 2k21. It's so nice not to have to worry about that with EAs game. Hitting certain bunker/ pitch shots can be a pain to time right in 2k. Even with 2ks flaws though the swing timing is great and the right challenge when it works correctly. I much prefer the putting in 2k too. My scores can very a lot. I can just have a lot of fun playing quick rounds. \n\nI'm going to enjoy both games. What I'm most excited about is the next 2k game. EA put together an impressive presentation and if 2k puts effort into that like they do their nba games they could have a really great game.\n\n### Comment ID jkpprlb with +4 score by [(of_patrol_bot, Reddit, 2023-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsPGATour/comments/13l4bow/ea_sports_pga_tour_vs_pga_2k23/jkpprlb/) (in reply to ID jkppqef):\nHello, it looks like you've made a mistake.\n\nIt's supposed to be could've, should've, would've (short for could have, would have, should have), never could of, would of, should of.\n\nOr you misspelled something, I ain't checking everything.\n\nBeep boop - yes, I am a bot, don't botcriminate me.\n\n#### Comment ID jkq3l8v with +3 score by [(RecentCollection1258, Reddit, 2023-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsPGATour/comments/13l4bow/ea_sports_pga_tour_vs_pga_2k23/jkq3l8v/) (in reply to ID jkpprlb):\nGo away\n\n#### Comment ID k6u7dw0 with +3 score by [(Total_Bookkeeper4237, Reddit, 2023-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsPGATour/comments/13l4bow/ea_sports_pga_tour_vs_pga_2k23/k6u7dw0/) (in reply to ID jkpprlb):\nYeah f--- off bot\n\n#### Comment ID kjq0sfr with +1 score by [(IndianapolisOvaries, Reddit, 2024-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsPGATour/comments/13l4bow/ea_sports_pga_tour_vs_pga_2k23/kjq0sfr/) (in reply to ID jkpprlb):\nGood bot\n\n## Comment ID jkp9s2o with +5 score by [(fatkid4sale, Reddit, 2023-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsPGATour/comments/13l4bow/ea_sports_pga_tour_vs_pga_2k23/jkp9s2o/) (in reply to ID 13l4bow):\nGot both on release. Since EA came out with theirs I have not played 2k... I have no idea why anyone would say 2k looks better.  It has objectively worse graphics mainly due to an outdated engine vs frostbite.\n\nHow the game \"feels\" is gonna be subjective. 2k is a math game.  No RNG and wind/elevation numbers are always spot on for distance. \n\n2k 3 click is MUCHHHHH harder on higher difficulty.  Like... There is no comparison. The 3 click on EA is very, very easy. I don't play 3 click so it doesn't really matter to me. \n\n2k has a higher difficulty ceiling for sure. \n\nAll that being said I much prefer the EA game due to graphics and I personally like the game/ball and swing physics much better.\n\n### Comment ID jkudkdi with +3 score by [(seabterry, Reddit, 2023-05-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsPGATour/comments/13l4bow/ea_sports_pga_tour_vs_pga_2k23/jkudkdi/) (in reply to ID jkp9s2o):\nI agree.

Here's my feeling on the two, using the same bullet point setup:\n\n1) The Sim/Arcade debate is a strange one to me - both games are Sim games, depending on the settings. And they are both Arcade, depending on the settings. For me, there was a steeper learning curve in 2K, EAs game has been pretty easy to pick up, and even easier to get good at on higher settings. But both games become easier after leveling/skilling up and upgrading club fittings/specs.\n\n2) EA's graphics are better, but I actually like the overall visual feel of 2K better on many courses. Still not sure why, but maybe the better (IMO) swing animations and ball physics have something to do with it. \n\n3) Career mode? This is clearly an EA advantage, by a wide margin. 2K's is there because it needs to be there, I think. Pretty meh.\n\n4) Not sure I agree, although I tend to ignore \"seasons\" after getting through a season of career mode.\n\n5) I completely disagree here, both games do a proper job of handling elevation changes. I have to do math in both to figure out carry distances, based on elevation/wind/lie/green & fairway firmness. And even with the lie effect on in EA, it doesn't appear to have much impact, at least on Tour settings.\n\n6) Disagree again, 2K ball physics are better than EAs, IMO. Certainly not perfect, but EA will  need to tinker with theirs some over time.\n\n7) 2K23 was buggy as hell when it was at the same point in release time as EA. Or, more accurately, they would patch something and break something else pretty regularly. It's in a much better state now, but there were definitely some frustrations right after launch.\n\nI play both regularly now, and enjoy both - if I had to pick only one, I'd go with 2K. But if EA adds turn-based online play and game options like skins/alt-shot, etc. AND they implement crossplay? That would make a huge difference, at least based on how I like to play these games.\n\n### Comment ID jkuc9za with +3 score by [(seabterry, Reddit, 2023-05-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsPGATour/comments/13l4bow/ea_sports_pga_tour_vs_pga_2k23/jkuc9za/) (in reply to ID jko8lex):\nThe cross play addition would be great in EA, but I just don’t feel like we will get it.\n\n### Comment ID jkqq745 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsPGATour/comments/13l4bow/ea_sports_pga_tour_vs_pga_2k23/jkqq745/) (in reply to ID jko8lex):\nI agree with all your points. One thing that 2K does well for putting is not having any feedback via controller vibrations on your putter takeaway. I hate how EA's putting will have your controller vibrating as you reach the \"ideal\" takeaway point and release the putter forward. And the putter visual in EA is also terrible where the putter head is like an inch to the left of the ball at setup.\n\nI much prefer 2K's putting. And EA's bunker play visuals and mechanics are miserable.\n\n### Comment ID juoxyho with +1 score by [(DoubleZ3, Reddit, 2023-08-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsPGATour/comments/13l4bow/ea_sports_pga_tour_vs_pga_2k23/juoxyho/) (in reply to ID jko8lex):\nIm super late just got pga2k on ps+.

At first I felt like EA was ridiculously hard in pro mode, but I had to learn the proper swing mechanics because 2k doesn't require a release of the thumbstick like EA. Once I got that down, I feel like they're pretty much the same. EA's ball mechanics and run out feel more real than 2k and I appreciate EA giving me all the shot types that 2k21 lacked, punch and flop especially. Doesn't matter game though, I can win tournaments by 15+ strokes. I'm going to try and adjust AI difficulty for EA to make it more challenging, I did that in 2k and then the pros were suddenly winning by 15+ strokes.\n\n## Comment ID jkoqwlg with +2 score by [(blacktearsandspit, Reddit, 2023-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsPGATour/comments/13l4bow/ea_sports_pga_tour_vs_pga_2k23/jkoqwlg/) (in reply to ID 13l4bow):\nLol!

I have a pc that can handle a lot of graphically intensive games no problem but this game has unbearable frame drops even when the game caps its frame rate at 30 fps by default. PC games usually release unoptimized and it takes a couple weeks for a patch to come out that optimizes game performance, but a year on from release and the game still runs like this?

Maybe pga tour mentioned here is a previous version? Last game I was hardcore in for golf was tiger woods 09 I believe. But mostly played the wii version with was 2004?   \n\nAs for physics just how the ball react Road to masters appear to be way better. I don´t quite understand what 2k23 ball is doing. Other then that I can´t compare to much. On easiest difficulty you can get around in 2k23 but there is mostly overswings because you have a time window of like 100s of a second between 90-100 %. And if you swing lower then that you can totally misshit actually. There is settings preventing you to overswing to much. \n\nTried mouse and it was marginally better but UI seems optimized for gamepad. I am sure you can dial in the swing particularly for mouse by changing mouse sensitivity but haven´t found that option in game? \n\nVisuals I run 2k23 on pc everything ultra at 4K/120 fps and it does hold up surprisingly well versus ps 5 version of road to masters. The later is so clean though the courses is just perfection. 30 fps I got used to but I suppose it does handicap you slightly regarding the swing and contribute to some lag I suspect. But it´s so much easier then 2k23s variant which is extremely hardcore it seems.   \n  \n. There is some distracting elements in 2k23 with antialiasing and some quirks in the distance. But it certainly looks good enough. Character models is better in 2k23 also having more cameras can be fun. Though I like how rooted I feel in PGA Tour due to lack of cameras.\n\nSound department. Road to masters hit a freaking homerun here it´s just awesome. \n\nGreens... Seems easier to read in 2k23 but I have not maxed out the putting skills so I get less beads in road to masters but there is more cameras. The putting mechanics here is also stressful with you having to hit the ball like baseball bat to get the swing to start just like you have to for full driver swing to make the game understand you started your downswing. But I like the animation feels like there is weight behind the putt.\n\n## Comment ID le7e8ps with +1 score by [(Stamp49, Reddit, 2024-07-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsPGATour/comments/13l4bow/ea_sports_pga_tour_vs_pga_2k23/le7e8ps/) (in reply to ID 13l4bow):\nEA PGA is trash and career is faaaaar from being better career mode than 2...ea golf is Hella boring and sluggish while 2k is keeping to what video games have always been and need to stay that way. \"arcade style\" simulations ruin the whole video game experience..

The camera is rigidly set, unlike in EA where almost 20 years ago you could watch a replay from many available cameras and angles!! Sometimes during a replay, instead of watching the flight of the ball or scoring a hole, we watch...the player. Another thing I've just noticed is the lack of ability to control the weather (wind speed) during training. It's strange that I can't, for example, set calm weather for one training session and a 6mph west wind for another... this was also available 20 years ago in EA.\n\n## Comment ID k4ih36m with +1 score by [(GrimmTrixX, Reddit, 2023-10-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsPGATour/comments/13l4bow/ea_sports_pga_tour_vs_pga_2k23/k4ih36m/) (in reply to ID 13l4bow):\nFor someone like me, who hasn't really played a golf game since Tiger woods 2001 for the PS2, but more specifically, the ea sports golf games on the Genesis with my dad as a kid... which should I play?\n\nI own every major console and I have access to PGA 2k23 on PS5, but I also have Xbox Game pass on my XBSX so I have access to EA Sports PGA Tour.\n\nSo for someone like me who would essentially be brand new to the golf games, which would be best to invest time into knowing I only plan to play 1? \n\nMy dad passed away in Jan 2022 and when I miss him I still play the old Genesis games.

Plus legends who are not under contract.  \n\nThen again they are a publicly traded business who needs to appease investors and getting people to re-buy the game, similar to 2k, will help their stock and make investors happy.

They are in a cloud environment and they can assign resources or take away resources as needed, they are not using a dedicated box for an old server/game.\n\nThey have a pool of physical servers, that gives them say, 100 GB of RAM and 100GB of storage combined (massively scaling down for the explanation, although if you have played online recently you may wonder....). So they may have 20 servers each with 5GB to get to that point. Virtually, they may say 10 servers is dedicated to our new game, 5 is dedicated to WWE, and 5 is dedicated to another 2K sports game.\n\nAt any time they can increase or decrease resources and say Ok, well our new title is really popular, lets take 1 WWE server and 1 other game server and add it to the popular game. This is all done virtually without needing physical hardware.\n\nThey CAN opt to add more physical hardware to the pool, so they could add another server and increase the overall amounts of pooled resources but these are expensive.\n\nI think it comes down to as you mention, if the server is not popular, they reassign resources and after a point there are so many games running that the resources are spread thin so they want to shut down anything they can so they can allocate those resources to other functions.\n\nHowever, its really just because they are greedy. The resources are there, and most likely they all have more than they need and they just want to force everyone to the new game. I think its very anti-consumer that they should down servers this fast and it is a major consideration for me with any new title.\n\n### Comment ID lru8pfp with +8 score by [(Rawrz720, Reddit, 2024-10-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/1g38vmc/2k_games_lifespan_is_a_joke/lru8pfp/) (in reply to ID lru5waf):\nThis always been the case.

It’s disappointing that all those development resources went into a pointless “story” when the developers could have focused on giving players more awesome tracks and cups to enjoy. The underlying racing mechanics are so very entertaining. Instead, though, we have a familiar story: a massive space to “explore” but no meaningful reason to do so. Developers, if all you’re going to do with open worlds is dump busywork on players and use it to pad out the number of hours it’ll take them to finish the game, then find a different format. Not everything needs an open world, and I would argue that arcade “kart” racers are a good example of that.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesHub](https://opencritic.com/outlet/847/gameshub)** - [Leah Williams](https://opencritic.com/critic/8973/leah-williams) - [4 / 5 ](https://www.gameshub.com/news/reviews/lego-2k-drive-review-campaign-racing-mode-2616307/)\n\n>At times, the game devolves into weirdness, but that’s part of its charm.

Something questionable, in a game so oriented to children.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Press Start](https://opencritic.com/outlet/491/press-start)** - [Kieron Verbrugge](https://opencritic.com/critic/4101/kieron-verbrugge) - [8.5 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/ps5-reviews/2023/05/14/lego-2k-drive-review/)\n\n>LEGO 2K Drive is a wildly impressive triple threat of a great LEGO game, a great open-world adventure and a great racing game. Whether you want to challenge your friends in slick and exciting head-to-head races, tackle a hefty single-player campaign stuffed with varied and plentiful content, or just spend hours building your own LEGO vehicles by the brick, you're absolutely covered here. A couple of issues aside, this is easily the best multiplatform arcade racer around.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Outerhaven Productions](https://opencritic.com/outlet/335/the-outerhaven-productions)** - [Karl Smart](https://opencritic.com/critic/2157/karl-smart) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://www.theouterhaven.net/2023/05/lego-2k-drive-driving-with-bricks/)\n\n>LEGO 2K Drive is a great racing game. The world that is built using a combination of LEGO bricks and real-world objects is stunning and looks like some kid or LEGO hobbyist, made this world in their own home. However, once the game tries to do something that is not racing using a racing control system, that's when the wheels fall off this particular LEGO racer.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheGamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/731/thegamer)** - [Stacey Henley](https://opencritic.com/critic/7588/stacey-henley) - [2.5 / 5 ](https://www.thegamer.com/lego-2k-drive-review/)\n\n>There is a lot here for a young kid to enjoy, especially one who is tuned into Lego. The tracks have solid variety, both in terms of aesthetics, obstacles, and various challenges (like lacking destructible items to fill the boost bar), but it barely matters when you'll win every race until you hit a progression wall that asks you to grind out cash generation or pay to skip it, and then start winning again. It's creative, but it's also a bit of a mess. Lego 2K Drive mixes Forza Horizon and Mario Kart together, but it's not as good as either of them, and doesn't bring much new to the table either. There are building blocks here for Lego to use for future IP-less games, but this doesn't quite put them all together in a way that will interest anyone who isn’t still in primary school.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Cody Medellin](https://opencritic.com/critic/4182/cody-medellin) - [7.5 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2023/5/15/reviews/137195-xbox-series-x-review-lego-2k-drive/)\n\n>LEGO 2K Drive is a fun romp if you know what you're getting into. The racing is fast and exciting, and the catch-up code seems tuned just right. The open worlds provide a ton to do, and the freeform exploration and destruction makes driving around feel enjoyable. The amount of grind needed to make some real progression can drag down things in the intervals, when there are no story-based missions. Some of the quests that aren't strictly related to racing can be very hit-and-miss in terms of enjoyment. The presence of microtransactions is unsettling to see in the publisher's non-sports titles. If you can ensure you aren't tempted to buy new cars due to the paltry reward payouts, you'll have a very good time with this racing title.\n\n-------------\n\n## Comment ID jkcswke with +282 score by [(rumsbumsrums, Reddit, 2023-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13j2u91/lego_2k_drive_review_thread/jkcswke/) (in reply to ID 13j2u91):\nWith all this monetization bullshit you would think it's at least F2P for some fun arcade racing in the side.\n\n\nNOPE, 60-120€ full price for the privilege of being milked even further.\n\n### Comment ID jkd0fm8 with +171 score by [(macarouns, Reddit, 2023-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13j2u91/lego_2k_drive_review_thread/jkd0fm8/) (in reply to ID jkcswke):\nIn a game aimed at children no less…\n\n#### Comment ID jkd73mv with +44 score by [(Varizio, Reddit, 2023-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13j2u91/lego_2k_drive_review_thread/jkd73mv/) (in reply to ID jkd0fm8):\nApperantly companies only learned one thing from that smurf app game scandal years ago....\n\n### Comment ID jkcz83n with +42 score by [(KeepDi9gin, Reddit, 2023-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13j2u91/lego_2k_drive_review_thread/jkcz83n/) (in reply to ID jkcswke):\nI remember when some accepted the $70 price hike because there would be less of this (in their minds).\n\nI knew better.\n\n#### Comment ID jkdd4zk with +27 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13j2u91/lego_2k_drive_review_thread/jkdd4zk/) (in reply to ID jkcz83n):\n>I remember when some accepted the $70 price hike because there would be less of this (in their minds).  \n>  \n>I knew better.\n\nRecently Nintendo hiked their price to $70 and you've already got people defending \"well, it's only for their premium games\".  \n\n\nI know better.

Not to mention that the moves are pretty much two to four possible different moves, they also don't allow you to obtain weapons or shit like that (unless you count a ball as a weapon).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWWE is not really that linear, you can roam around the area (admittedly pretty short, but since 2K17 is coming with Crowd Fighting, and Backstage Brawls, more areas will arise), and do different shit with other people. For example, you can have one guy jumping off the ladder, two guys putting each other through barricades, and three guys pile weapon after weapon into the pile in the ring.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTalking about weapons, you can have many rendered items available for your use. Which, just by itself with six people, kinda lags the game.\n\n\n\nEDIT 1: I'll like to bring attention to /u/platinum92's comment, pointing out some things that I wasn't even thinking about (but I should've), such as the A.I. of the Madden and (I think he or she meant) NBA having a set path of movement, or just being a simple decision of the A.I. (Go up, down, left, right). However, the WWE games' A.I. have to make decisions at the situation at hand. I should've thought of this because I made a whole post about it a while back, but the high polygon count could also contribute with the problem of not having six players, however, the NBA series models look good or even better than the WWE models. So I still believe that gameplay has SOME contribution to the situation.\n\n\nI should mention of what I meant as \"linear\", I was just talking about the in both Madden and NBA, you really just run to end to end and, in NBA, shoot the goal. You can't really do any other things besides that. WWE can let six players go to different places of the area to do shit.\n\n\n\nAm I saying the WWE games are flawless? No, they're far from it ~~hairphysics~~. I'm just saying the some of the [\"unfair\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipfrAHxJsVs) shit that people bring up.\n\n\n## Comment ID d6yf9my with +5 score by [(platinum92, Reddit, 2016-08-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/4zr9a3/addressing_the_wwe_2k_vs_sports_games_discussions/d6yf9my/) (in reply to ID 4zr9a3):\nAs someone with game development background,your second point isn't too far off, but far enough off to be wrong.\n\nIt isn't that Madden and 2k are linear, it's that those players have set plays to follow. Their movement is decided and the engine doesn't have to handle that logic. In WWE, the AI has to check the situation and figure out what's going on and have its wrestler do that.\n\nAnother reason for frame rate slowdowns is polygon count. I guarantee you a basketball or football jersey has infinitely less polys than pixelated John Cena's torso. Plus I bet the detailed attire probably has a high poly count. These take time to render each frame and 6 could be the cap.\n\nTL;DR - The AI logic and HD models are likely the reason you can't have more than 6 at a time.\n\n### Comment ID d6ygvrb with +1 score by [(Some-Crappy-Edits, Reddit, 2016-08-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/4zr9a3/addressing_the_wwe_2k_vs_sports_games_discussions/d6ygvrb/) (in reply to ID d6yf9my):\nYeah, I should've mention the point of HD models combined with the gameplay,  but the A.I. wasn't a thing I was thinking about.\n\n\n\nThanks for your side of the conversation.\n\n### Comment ID d6yi463 with +1 score by [(Shrekt115, Reddit, 2016-08-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/4zr9a3/addressing_the_wwe_2k_vs_sports_games_discussions/d6yi463/) (in reply to ID d6yf9my):\nIf only the AI was actually smart\n\n#### Comment ID d6ymj8d with +1 score by [(MrKain, Reddit, 2016-08-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/4zr9a3/addressing_the_wwe_2k_vs_sports_games_discussions/d6ymj8d/) (in reply to ID d6yi463):\nIn comparison to the amount of AI in most other games, this AI is brilliant.\n\nIt just can't keep up with the multitasking power of a human brain.\n\nAnd thank God for that.\n\n## Comment ID d6y8ize with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2016-08-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/4zr9a3/addressing_the_wwe_2k_vs_sports_games_discussions/d6y8ize/) (in reply to ID 4zr9a3):\nGood post.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, these fundamental flaws in the WWE series of games (both legit and unfounded) will never be corrected so long as the games release on a yearly schedule.

That game wasn't great but it was kinda hilarious to see so many people in the ring.\n\nI do have a computer science degree and I haven't seen anything with the A.I. that gives me the impression the system couldn't handle more than 6 players. The A.I. only has to keep track and react to a fairly small amount of variables, concerning its move set, health, match type. I haven't seen anything in the gameplay that suggests it is doing any sort of advanced planning or processing. It doesn't treat me different whether I play as a diva or Stone Cold, so it seems to disregard the player's move set. With that said, we don't know the programming that's going on behind-the-scenes.\n\nEither way, 6 is enough for me. 8 would be neat though.\n\n### Comment ID d6zk7ir with +1 score by [(Some-Crappy-Edits, Reddit, 2016-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/4zr9a3/addressing_the_wwe_2k_vs_sports_games_discussions/d6zk7ir/) (in reply to ID d6zjr72):\nLet's think of it tho.\n\n\nHave you seen the graphics in WWF Royal Rumble?

This claim is bullshit. The gameplay area in both of these games are way more open and larger than the average WWE 2K game which is why they can have so much players in a game. In fact I'd say it's because the play area in WWE 2K games is extremely limited which is why we have 6 or less people in the ring.\n\n### Comment ID d6yekg3 with +2 score by [(Some-Crappy-Edits, Reddit, 2016-08-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/4zr9a3/addressing_the_wwe_2k_vs_sports_games_discussions/d6yekg3/) (in reply to ID d6ybfk0):\nOf course, but Yuke's has to make these wrestlers look good enough to sell, the Community Creations don't, not to mention that most of the CAW makers make characters on their own time, Yuke's needs to make the characters by (what I assume) a strict schedule, however, Yuke's is a two group team, CAWs are are usually made by just one.\n\n\n\n\nI'm not saying you can't be strategic or anything with something like Madden or NBA, because I get lost in these games myself, I was just talking general gameplay compared to WWE's, and how it's pretty linear GAMEPLAY wise (basically, the map is in no way small, but the gameplay doesn't give you much freedom). In NBA/Madden, you really have to folllow the ball or you'll be lost off screen, plus there's isn't much to do besides the average game. WWE, again, can have multiple people doing multiple things at once, which already screws with the engine already."

I've had multiple people tell me that they didn't understand what they were supposed to be doing in their new roles as the org restructured for the third time. \n\nLack of Development Opportunities: They've discussed something about career paths but nothing has come of this in years.

Water seeks its own level. And the watermark is high here.\r\n\r\nEveryone here has met two tenets: Exceptional talent and exceptional character. We have a no a-holes policy. No level of skill or ability excuses toxic personalities. We believe Trust matters most towards an environment of psychological safety where we can take risks to innovate and grow to achieve excellence in all we do.\r\n\r\nWe laugh a LOT here and we work hard. We believe that you can bring your best and whole self to work and that will make you, the team and game better. We value each other as people first. \r\n\r\nI truly look forward to going to work every Monday. I've been fortunate to work in an Industry I love for many years. I'm even more fortunate to be happier than I've ever been in my work at this stage of my career. \r\n\r\n31st Union is a unique team of amazing people. I'm grateful and humbled to be a part of it.",

      "# [BioShock, XCOM, Civ 6 freed from 2K Launcher (Eurogamer) on 2024-11-27](https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/bioshock-xcom-civ-6-freed-from-2k-launcher-eurogamer.693277/)\nHaven't seen anything else on this recently, so just wanted to make sure folks were aware of the latest:\n\nBioShock, XCOM, Civ 6 freed from 2K Launcher\n\nBioShock and Mafia publisher 2K has killed off its PC launcher, and uncoupled its top titles from the software.\n\nSteam and Epic Games Store versions of BioShock Remastered, BioShock 2 Remastered, BioShock Infinite, Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition, Civilization 5 and 6, The Quarry, XCOM 2, XCOM: Chimera Squad and Marvel's Midnight Suns will now run without the 2K Launcher opening first.\n\nIn a blog post on the changes, 2K said its launcher had now been removed from every game that used it on Epic and Steam. Last night, an update was sent out to 2K games on Steam to ensure its removal - in case you wondered why BioShock was patched again.\n\nI can confirm I have updates pending for Civ VI and Bioshock:\n\nThis is actually as of a few months ago for Civ VI (https://forums.civfanatics.com/thre...native-2k-launcher-no-longer-required.691245/), although it's news for some other 2K games.\n\nKind of refreshing. The only launchers that I've found useful have been ones that let me configure which mods I'm playing with, and I'd just as well configure that in-game like is done with Civ VI. And the launcher probably made less sense for 2K than for some other publishers, given the diversity of types of games that 2K publishes. I can at least see the argument for something like the Total War launcher - you fire up Attila Total War and learn there's been a big update for Pharoah Total War, you might decide it's time to pick up the latter game since it was likely in your wheelhouse anyway. The overlap is likely lower among 2K's games.",

      "# [Multiplayer Game Options](https://pgatour.2k.com/2k25/up-your-game/multiplayer-game-options/)\nNothing comes quite as close to replicating the competitive thrill of the golf course as experiencing multiplayer modes on our PGA TOUR 2K games. No matter if your console of choice is an Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation®5, or PC, PGA TOUR 2K25 is packed with unbeatable multiplayer options that allow you to pit your skills against fellow gamers across the globe.\n\nRead on to learn how you can get the most out of PGA TOUR 2K25 multiplayer.\n\nPLAY AGAINST OTHERS ONLINE\n\nAs with previous releases, PGA TOUR 2K25 benefits from a string of gameplay-enhancing, multiplayer features. These features add an extra competitive spark, allowing you to challenge friends or fellow golf and gaming enthusiasts worldwide.\n\nOur array of multiplayer options allows you to play in numerous ways:\n\nPlay locally against friends or ‘ghosts’—which allow you to test your progress by playing against a previous version of your own performance.\n\nPlay online with friends in a private match or publicly in matchmaking modes such as Quick Play, Divot Derby, Topgolf, High Rollers, Skins, and more.\n\nCreate and/or compete in Societies—run your own events and tournaments!\n\nCompete in daily and weekly tournaments in 2K Ranked Tours.\n\nClimb the leaderboards in Ranked Matchmaking in the 1v1 Solo or 2v2 Duos playlists.\n\nWhen playing with your friends, you can either battle it out against each other in a head-to-head match or work together to dominate in competitions.\n\nHOW TO SET UP A PUBLIC MATCH\n\nPublic Matchmaking is available for casual Matchmaking and Topgolf modes. Before getting started, remember that casual Matchmaking rounds are restricted to the Pro Am difficulty level.\n\nCompete Online with Matchmaking\n\nOn the Main Menu, use R1 (PlayStation), RB (Xbox), or Q and E (PC) to navigate to the Play Menu, then select “Matchmaking” with X (PlayStation), A (Xbox), or Left Click (PC). Then select “Create Room.”\n\nNow on the Playlists menu, select one of the offered playlists.\n\nBefore joining the Matchmaking queue, you have the option to add another player with Square (PlayStation), X (Xbox), or C (PC).\n\nReady to compete? Select “Ready” with X (PlayStation), A (Xbox), or Left Click (PC) and you will enter the Matchmaking queue.\n\nPLAY TOPGOLF ONLINE\n\nOn the Main Menu, use R1 (PlayStation), RB (Xbox), or Q and E (PC) to navigate to the Play Menu, then select “Topgolf” with X (PlayStation), A (Xbox), or Left Click (PC).\n\nSelect “New Match” to create your own lobby, or “Matchmaking” to automatically enter the Topgolf Matchmaking queue.\n\nBefore joining the Matchmaking queue, you have the option to add another player with Square (PlayStation), X (Xbox), or C (PC) from the Topgolf lobby.\n\nSelect “Begin Match” and you will enter the Topgolf Matchmaking queue.\n\nHOW TO SET UP A PRIVATE MATCH\n\nWhile the fun of playing against gamers worldwide is undeniable, the thrill and camaraderie of going head-to-head with a few close friends can be exhilarating.\n\nWhether you’re a group of golfers who regularly duke it out on the course, or just committed gamers ready to kick back with some virtual competition, our private match mode is just what you need. Our comprehensive options allow you to play in multiple formats including stroke play, stableford, match play, skins, four ball, alternate shot, and 2-vs-2 scramble.\n\nWith fully customizable settings, you can set everything yourself, from the course to the difficulty level and the conditions. Choose your preferred course conditions, including wind speed and direction, fairway and green firmness, and green speeds. To amplify the realism, each condition will change the gameplay to match the challenges of a real-life course.\n\nThe customization of each course goes further still, allowing you to control everything from the crowd to the tees you play from. What’s more, these options are also available in a Society, allowing you to raise the stakes while competing with golfers far and wide. To learn more about creating or playing in a Society, visit our page here.\n\nHOW TO ADJUST MULTIPLAYER DIFFICULTY\n\nOne of the beauties of golf is how accessible it is to players of all levels. Whether you’re a novice player taking your first swing on the tee, or a tournament player looking to reduce an already formidable handicap, golf is a sport that allows you to progress at your own pace.\n\nIt’s for this reason, that we’ve applied this same accessibility to the world of golf gaming. PGA TOUR 2K25 multiplayer has been designed to simultaneously offer support for newcomers while providing enough challenge to entertain expert players.\n\nMULTIPLAYER MATCHMAKING DIFFICULTY SETTING\n\nAll casual matchmaking matches are played on a Pro Am difficulty level—giving players the freedom to choose between Swing Stick and 3-Click, but only having select gameplay aids turned on. For more on mastering new EvoSwing mechanics, you can get a head start by going here.\n\nThe Pro Am difficulty level allows us to bring together the best of both worlds, providing gameplay that remains a challenge to experienced players without alienating newcomers. This ensures as many people as possible can enjoy the competitive thrill of our online mode.\n\nDIFFICULTY IN PRIVATE MULTIPLAYER\n\nWhen playing a private match, you have the option to fully customize the level of difficulty available. PGA TOUR 2K25 difficulty settings even allow you to select different levels for different players—including desired swing input (i.e. Swing Stick or 3-click). In addition to swing input, difficulty levels can also be set for distance control and pro vision—the in-game mechanic that takes aspects of the shot setup, like elevation, wind, lie penalty and more, into account for you so you only need to focus on your aim and your swing. This freedom gives players of all levels the ability to have a competitive match with other players of differing skill.\n\nRANKED MATCHMAKING IN PGA TOUR 2K25\n\nProve your skills on the course and climb the world-wide leaderboards in PGA TOUR 2K25.\n\nRANKED MATCHMAKING IN PGA TOUR 2K25\n\nCompete in 1v1 or 2v2 rounds on Pro difficulty using Swing Stick only. Work your way up by winning matches and earning rating to secure promotions to higher tiers. Receive promotion rewards for reaching new tiers and participation rewards just for playing.\n\n2K RANKED TOURS IN PGA TOUR 2K25\n\nBuilding on the Official 2K Society from previous PGA TOUR 2K games, 2K Ranked Tours, allows you to compete in daily and weekly tournaments. Perform well to earn merits and receive promotions to higher tiers. Earn seasonal rewards from promotions and participation.\n\nSEASONAL LEADERBOARD RESETS IN PGA TOUR 2K25\n\nAlongside the wider content that can be expected each season, players can expect leaderboard resets across Ranked Matchmaking and Ranked Tours. Those that finish at the top each season will continue to need to prove their dominance, whilst the underdogs are always presented with a new opportunity to climb the ranks.\n\nGo here to read more about Societies and Ranked Play.",

      "# [2K Games' motion capture studio votes to unionise by James Batchelor on 2024-11-25](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/2k-games-motion-capture-studio-votes-to-unionise)\nWorkers at 2K Games' California-based motion capture studio have successfully voted to unionise.\n\nFollowing the news last month, the election was supervised by the National Labor Relations Board and the action was approved on Friday with a vote of 15 for, 6 against.\n\nThe 2K Mocap Union will unionise under the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which claimed in a statement that this will be the first unionisation of a motion capture studio in the games industry.\n\nBased in the Californian city of Petaluma, 2K Motion Capture Studio has worked on many of Take-Two's biggest franchises, such as NBA 2K, WWE 2K and BioShock.\n\nFollowing the unionisation, the workers will enter negotiations with 2K management to agree on a new contract, with the union pushing for better job security, fair pay and improved working conditions.\n\n\"Today it is evident that the people at this studio truly want what is best not only for themselves, but what is best for their coworkers, future generations of workers, and the studio as a whole,\" said 2K motion capture animator Matthew Peterson. \"Whilst this campaign has not been without its challenges, it is inspiring that the core driving force of this movement is empathy for one another.\n\n\"I look forward to negotiating in good faith with Take-Two, and I hope that other workers in our industry will feel inspired to organise and gain the protections that are necessary not only to survive, but thrive.\"\n\nIATSE International president Matthew D. Loeb added: \"This victory is not just about one studio; it’s about the future of work in the video game industry.\n\n\"2K MoCap workers have shown what many other entertainment workers already know — that collective action is the best way to secure fairness, equity, and respect in the workplace. Their courage will inspire others in the industry to follow suit. This outcome also demonstrates what can be achieved when workers exercise their right to organise, a right that we will continue to fight to defend and expand.\"",

Hope all is well. I'm debating getting wwe 2k25, haven't gotten a wwe game since 2k22 was on sale. Got Fight for tHe Fallen when it was free and didn't play more than a few hours tops. In terms of features, options and availability, the 2k series is the obvious pinnacle of a wrestling game, at this moment.\n\nWith that being said, I want to know from you and fellow bloggers, whenever you picked up your copy of a wwe game, whether recent or your last go at it, what direction did you start populating your CAW's and arenas in? For me, it was late 80's/early 90s WWF. But once AEW came around, i just flood my slots with their roster and a lot of NJPW. I may be critical of it on tv, but the hard hitting, strong style, no-selling comebacks and high risk moves are perfect in a video game world and I enjoy it immensely.\n\nI typically buy the 2k games when they go on sale months later and then play the tutorial and never touch them again. All I want is a next gen update of No Mercy! Why is this such a hard thing for anyone to deliver?",
      "# [We just beat a PC gaming villain: 2K removes its pointless, game-breaking launcher from its entire catalogue by Joshua Wolens on 2024-11-26](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/we-just-beat-a-pc-gaming-villain-2k-removes-its-pointless-game-breaking-launcher-from-its-entire-catalogue/)\nRemember the 2K Launcher, the completely pointless bit of bloatware that got crammed into games like BioShock Remastered, Civ 6, Mafia, and XCOM 2? The one that straight-up broke certain games for some users and dinged performance in others? It's dead. Gone. Donezo. Never, god willing, to return.\n\n2K announced the \"complete sunset\" of its extraneous launcher in a blog post yesterday, although it actually kicked in a few days prior. \"As of November 18, 2024, the 2K Launcher has been removed from every game that used it on Epic and Steam,\" went the announcement, and \"On November 25, a follow-up update was sent out via Steam to make sure the 2K Launcher was fully removed.\" 2K also says it has removed the \"2K Launcher beta,\" a new and improved version of that garbage, from Civ 5.\n\nIn other words, the evil is defeated. Oh, fine, not evil, but I along with many others have been thoroughly annoyed by the prevalence of launcher bloat over the past few years. I have never, not once, not ever been happy to see another bit of software pop up when I try to launch a game from Steam, whether it's Uplay or Origin. Sorry, I mean Ubisoft Connect or the EA App.\n\nI dream of a world in which every launcher only launches games, rather than other launchers, but doing away with 2K's thing is a decent start. There are some complications for certain now-launcherless 2K games, mind you. XCOM 2 was one of very few games to attach some functionality to the 2K Launcher—it handled mod support—so launching that game from Steam will now present you with options to launch either the \"original\" or \"new\" mod launchers—though you can also just launch the game directly if you're modless.\n\nYou can get a breakdown of the difference between the mod launchers here, but long story short: the original mod launcher will warn you about incompatible mods but still let you play them while the new one won't. XCOM: Chimera Squad has a similar thing going on, but it only has the one mod launcher option. As a bonus, all these mod launchers work on the Steam Deck, says 2K.\n\nSo hey, props to 2K for realising everyone hated its launcher and doing the right thing. It might have been better not to launch it at all, but life is a learning process. I did laugh at one of the removal announcements beginning with the phrase \"All things must come to an end... and that includes our 2K Launcher.\" Pretty sure that saying is usually 'all good things,' but I suppose 2K couldn't quite bring itself to say it."

    "# 2K Games Company and Product Report\n\n## Company Overview\n\n2K Games, founded in 2005, is a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. and is known for developing and publishing interactive entertainment across various platforms, including consoles, PCs, and mobile devices. The company is home to several renowned development studios, including Firaxis Games, Visual Concepts, and Hangar 13, and boasts a portfolio that includes popular franchises such as NBA 2K, Borderlands, BioShock, and Sid Meier's Civilization [(2K, 2024)](cache://newsroom-2k/4).\n\nAs of 2024, 2K Games has been actively expanding its offerings, with new titles and updates announced for several of its franchises. The company is also involved in community engagement through events and contests, such as the NBA 2K25 Logo Gauntlet [(2K, 2024)](https://nba.2k.com/2k25/logo-gauntlet/rules/).\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### Unionization Efforts\n\nIn a significant move for labor rights in the gaming industry, workers at 2K's motion capture studio in California voted to unionize under the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE). This marks the first unionization of a motion capture studio in the gaming sector, with workers advocating for better job security, fair pay, and improved working conditions. Matthew Peterson, a motion capture animator, expressed optimism about negotiating in good faith with management, stating, \"Today it is evident that the people at this studio truly want what is best not only for themselves, but what is best for their coworkers\" [(Batchelor, GamesIndustry.biz, 2024)](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/2k-games-motion-capture-studio-votes-to-unionise).\n\n### Removal of 2K Launcher\n\n2K Games has officially removed its proprietary launcher from all titles that previously required it, including popular games like BioShock and Civilization VI. This decision, which took effect on November 18, 2024, was met with positive feedback from the gaming community, as the launcher had been criticized for causing performance issues and unnecessary complications for players [(Wolens, PC Gamer, 2024)](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/we-just-beat-a-pc-gaming-villain-2k-removes-its-pointless-game-breaking-launcher-from-its-entire-catalogue/).\n\n## Product Overview: 2K Games Titles\n\n### Upcoming Releases\n\n1. **Borderlands 4**\n   - Scheduled for release in early 2025, Borderlands 4 will introduce players to a new planet and a cast of four new Vault Hunters. The game promises dynamic movement abilities, deep skill trees, and a variety of weapons, continuing the franchise's tradition of chaotic gameplay [(2K, 2024)](https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/).\n\n2. **Sid Meier's Civilization VII**\n   - Announced for a 2025 release, Civilization VII aims to build on the franchise's legacy with innovative features and gameplay mechanics. Sid Meier, the franchise's creator, expressed excitement about the new installment, stating, \"What the team is looking to accomplish with Civilization VII is nothing short of breathtaking\" [(2K, 2024)](cache://newsroom-2k/4).\n\n3. **NBA 2K25**\n   - The latest installment in the NBA 2K series, NBA 2K25, has introduced new content and rewards for its second season, including collaborations with artists for its soundtrack and new in-game items. The game continues to evolve with features that enhance player engagement and community interaction [(2K, 2024)](https://newsroom-uk.2k.com/news/nbar-2k25-season-2-accept-the-challenge-to-become-the-best-of-the-best-starting-on-october-18).\n\n### Community Engagement and Contests\n\n2K Games has been actively engaging its community through various contests and events. The NBA 2K25 Logo Gauntlet allows players to compete in a game show format, with opportunities to win in-game currency and exclusive items. This initiative not only promotes player interaction but also enhances the competitive spirit within the community [(2K, 2024)](https://nba.2k.com/2k25/logo-gauntlet/rules/).\n\n## Financial and Market Position\n\n2K Games is part of Take-Two Interactive, which is publicly traded on NASDAQ under the symbol TTWO. The company has reported significant sales figures, with the Civilization franchise alone selling over 70 million copies and accumulating more than 1 billion hours of gameplay [(2K, 2024)](cache://newsroom-2k/4). This strong market presence positions 2K Games as a key player in the interactive entertainment industry.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n2K Games continues to innovate and expand its portfolio with upcoming titles and community-focused initiatives. The recent unionization of its motion capture studio reflects a growing trend towards labor organization in the gaming industry, while the removal of the 2K Launcher demonstrates responsiveness to player feedback. As the company prepares for the release of major titles like Borderlands 4 and Civilization VII, it remains a significant entity in the gaming landscape, appealing to both players and investors alike."
