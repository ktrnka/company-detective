The benefit is that you can get files for the latest squads/teams for older games like PES2018 or some shit.\n\nOne of the reasons PES never took off was because of its “ease of accessibility” despite having Option Files the fact you had to do it at all erased 90% of the market for it.\n\nEven if they make teams/leagues/kits shareable in game, I 100% don’t doubt that they will remove any “100% accurate league” or other community changes.

They are in a cloud environment and they can assign resources or take away resources as needed, they are not using a dedicated box for an old server/game.\n\nThey have a pool of physical servers, that gives them say, 100 GB of RAM and 100GB of storage combined (massively scaling down for the explanation, although if you have played online recently you may wonder....). So they may have 20 servers each with 5GB to get to that point. Virtually, they may say 10 servers is dedicated to our new game, 5 is dedicated to WWE, and 5 is dedicated to another 2K sports game.\n\nAt any time they can increase or decrease resources and say Ok, well our new title is really popular, lets take 1 WWE server and 1 other game server and add it to the popular game. This is all done virtually without needing physical hardware.\n\nThey CAN opt to add more physical hardware to the pool, so they could add another server and increase the overall amounts of pooled resources but these are expensive.\n\nI think it comes down to as you mention, if the server is not popular, they reassign resources and after a point there are so many games running that the resources are spread thin so they want to shut down anything they can so they can allocate those resources to other functions.\n\nHowever, its really just because they are greedy. The resources are there, and most likely they all have more than they need and they just want to force everyone to the new game. I think its very anti-consumer that they should down servers this fast and it is a major consideration for me with any new title.\n\n### Comment ID lru8pfp with +9 score by [(Rawrz720, Reddit, 2024-10-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/1g38vmc/2k_games_lifespan_is_a_joke/lru8pfp/) (in reply to ID lru5waf):\nThis always been the case.

This is their API. I saw that I have 5 platforms connected and Game Center is among them. \n\nFrom their account page, I could see other platforms except for game center. Other platforms can be unlinked by visiting the unlink endpoints like [https://accounts.2k.com/auth/nintendo/unlink](https://accounts.2k.com/auth/nintendo/unlink). But it didn't work for gamecenter. [https://accounts.2k.com/auth/gamecenter/unlink](https://accounts.2k.com/auth/gamecenter/unlink) redirects me to a 404 page.\n\nI will continue trying to contact Aspyr support. It's so bad that they have a bug and don't respond to support requests.\n\n### Comment ID f1e6lrk with +5 score by [(crackofdawn, Reddit, 2019-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/ch8qpi/impossible_to_login_to_2k_account_on_civ_6_ios/f1e6lrk/) (in reply to ID f1dn568):\nThey actually closed my ticket yesterday, the one from when I first opened this thread, first they emailed me a month or so ago asking whether i still wanted the ticket to remain open and since nothing had been done yet at all i replied yes, and then yesterday they said they were switching to a new ticketing system and closing all existing tickets.\n\nSuch bullshit.\n\n#### Comment ID f1h5mqu with +3 score by [(aifreedom, Reddit, 2019-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/ch8qpi/impossible_to_login_to_2k_account_on_civ_6_ios/f1h5mqu/) (in reply to ID f1e6lrk):\nIt happened to me too.

I stopped caring for a while but tried to get it working again. In the past I contacted 2K and Aspyr but only got tips from them. I just got it working again but there was a lot of trial and error as I also used Steam to play as well. Here is a list of things to try (most are listed in the thread in one way or another):\n\n1. Disconnect 2K from all other accounts, steam, epic, google (this is accessible on 2K's site)\n2. Log out of 2K in all Civ VI games (whether steam, switch, PS, Xbox, etc)\n3. Restore purchases (on ios: \"Get More Content\" -> \"Restore Purchases\")\n4. Logging out of your Apple ID (go the \"Settings\" app, click your apple ID name in the top, under \"iCloud\", \"Media & Purchases\", \"Find My\", etc, there should be a \"Sign Out\" option)\n\nNote: Every time you change something, reset the app (not just exiting out, in the Home screen, swiping up and pausing so you see what apps are open and swipe civ vi away). Yes its tedious but changes won't go into affect until you do that (they also say wait 15 min but I'm impatient)\n\nOption 4 is what worked for me most recently. For that though, I logged out, opened Civ and the option to login to 2K was available (the logo turned Red from Grey previously) but you need iCloud in order to connect 2K. So with Civ still open in the background, I logged back in and did not allow my iCloud to merge. Then I reset the app and it was working. I know the iCloud merge is probably not possible for everyone but it was what worked. \n\nIt seems like in order to make this work, you need your ios game to believe this is your only civ/2k account. It's stupid and you would think after years it would be fixed but alas. May your achievements not be deleted and your clouds connect.\n\n## Comment ID ev0wciq with +1 score by [(Nickjrock, Reddit, 2019-07-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/ch8qpi/impossible_to_login_to_2k_account_on_civ_6_ios/ev0wciq/) (in reply to ID ch8qpi):\nSame here\n\n### Comment ID ev0wpiq with +1 score by [(crackofdawn, Reddit, 2019-07-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/ch8qpi/impossible_to_login_to_2k_account_on_civ_6_ios/ev0wpiq/) (in reply to ID ev0wciq):\nI've tried everything.

That’s… I can”t say I’m surprised but I certainly am disappointed.\n\nBefore I continue writing, I’d like to thank you for your patience with any and all grammatical errors I make. English is not my first language.\n\nI figured out a way to fix this issue that  I had just now, though. This worked for me but I cannot guarantee that it works for anybody else.\n\nI honestly don’t remember how but I managed to get the  2k logo to not be greyed out. But I did (keep reading, even if you haven’t been able to do this, please!) Then connected my 2K account through the app.  \nthis caused a whole bunch of issues.\n\n\\- The 2k logo was red but said I was not logged in to it.  \n\\- Clicking the logo  prompted me to log in to my 2K account again. Tried doing that, and it said that my game center account was already linked to another 2K account.\n\nAt this point, after some cussing, I went to the 2K webpage and checked my connections. I was indeed connected to my game center account. But then why wouldn’t  the game center recognise this and make the connection?\n\nOdd.\n\nI disconnected Game Center from the connections and tried to log in through the civ game on my iPad. The exact same thing happened again. insane as I am, I did this a couple of times, expecting different results. Surprise - The exact thing happened.\n\nI finally realised that it was possible to account through the K2 webpage not use the app. So I tried that. it connected properly once I had restarted the app.  \nI obviously can’t test the theory but I suspect that using their website to connect with apple as opposed to through the  game app itself might have sorted this out for me sooner. But, as I said, it’s but a theory. I’d genuinely love hearing the result of that should anybody try it (So if your 2K logo is grey, I would appreciate it if you entertained my idea and gave it a go, worth a try, right?).\n\nI am yet to try to start a cross-platform game with somebody. Will edit this post with an update about that once I have. For some reason I’m  not expecting a smooth ride.\n\n  \nEDIT\n\nSo I managed to set up a cloud game with my partner who’s playing on their PC through steam. It runs pretty well. Takes a while to sync the saves/turns and the game restarts for each new turn, but I don’t have many complains about it and am kind of surprised it wasn’t more difficult than just.. setting it up as usual.

I was just looking for cloud saves. Found no answers online and the FAQs don't even mention a disabled state for the 2k button.\n\n*Preface:* *I downloaded Civ6 from the respective Apple App Stores (iOS, iPadOS, MacOS). Solution may differ if from Epic or Steam.* \n\n**Game Center:**\n\nFirst and foremost, the connection to Civ6 servers requires Game Center. Without it, you're offline. You need to have GameCenter enabled on your device. When you launch the app, if you see a Game Center notification that you're signed in, then you know you're good here. \n\n**Log In and Link Accounts:**\n\n*(I honestly don't understand the mechanics of this one, or if it's even necessary in addition to Game Center, but I took an overkill approach)* \n\nOn both the native browser (Safari) and the default browser (Chrome for me), sign into your 2k Account. If you haven't already, link your 2k Account anywhere you can (I linked Steam, Epic, and Google). \n\n**Close, Relaunch, Verify:**\n\nThird: Make sure you're logged into all of those linked accounts on your browser(s) (2K, Epic, Steam, Gmail for me). Close / Quit Civ6 completely. Re-launch it. Verify Game Center sign-in message appears. 2k account button (bottom right) should work now. \n\nIf this doesn't work for you, let me know the situation (device, download platform, etc.) and I can offer some troubleshooting advice. \n\n*Thoughts*\n\n*This game was released in 2016, so I will accept that you need to jump through invisible hoops to get this to work if it doesn't work the first time.

If I scroll over to 2K Account on the menu tabs, it says \"Failed to retrieve platform account info.\"\n\nEDIT:  I got curious to see if this would happen with other 2K games, so I loaded up NBA2K23 and it connects to servers just fine.  Went back to Top Spin, and immediately get the error while the opening screens scroll by.  Then right before the main menus come up I got a new screen I didn't get the first time, saying something about \"successfully linking my 2K account\" and it says I earned 500VC.

Certain moves make you slide to the left or right (or if your on the ground roll away)... please make every reversal have an actual counter to it (Sliding doesn’t count) Too many people can spam one move and then use one of the other “quick” moves to force you to reverse twice in a row. It’s extremely cheap and frustrating. Reversal Burner moves have run rampant throughout this game for YEARS. \n2. A spamming detection system needs to be in place. Unfortunately not all moves are created equal and the  harder to reverse moves can be spammed over and over again. Reward players to play more creatively and I think you’ll see people return to this game.\nAlso as a side note: I know people in leagues that love how cool some moves look but are afraid to use them because they do not want to get majored reversed in a game. Any game that makes you “afraid” to use a wrestling move needs to remove all major reversals. Also, in tornado tags - most leagues have a “respect the move” rule. It would be nice to have that as a option - for example if my partner is getting a move place on him I would be unable to break up the move. I would have to wait until the animation is complete before I could strike. Sometime just bumping into your own partner causes a move to get broken up. Please give me this option on future games.\n\n### Comment ID fs7tktf with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7tktf/) (in reply to ID fs7moub):\n[removed]\n\n#### Comment ID fs7vwag with +4 score by [(Neg_Crepe, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7vwag/) (in reply to ID fs7tktf):\n>optional GM features to universe mode?\n\nit needs to be a separated mode.

Being completely honest, I hate the rivalry system. We face our opponents so many times before the ppv, even in WrestleMania rivalries.

There are so many aspects of the game that probably require a lot more effort that it appears on the surface.  Delivering a giant roster, for example. Or being able to create your own superstar and add any of 9000 costume parts to customize him or her. To give you a sense of the complexity there, we use a system called \"fit tech\" to make all the CAS parts fit onto superstars of different sizes. Fit tech has a line of code for every word in the entire Harry Potter book series, plus 100,000 more!

Early on, I spent a ton of time with the creative director, and we went through a bunch of shows, PPV’s and such. I responded to a lot of it, and really wanted to synthesize into a unifying theme. Then, one day, I walked past his desk and he was watching some behind the scenes material that really focused on Bautista. I stopped in my tracks, and we spend the next hour or so scrubbing through material. I think the vision really emerged from those conversations—what’s it like to actually BE on the roster, to be a part of this spectacular entertainment?

However recently I have become interested in wrestling again and was going to buy the most recent game at the time (2K19), however I thought the servers would go offline so I waited for 2K20, we know how that turned out. After that I thought the 2K franchise was just plain bad, and I wouldn't have a game that was like the ones I'd play when I was younger (SvR 2008-WWE13).\n\nBut, with the announcement of you taking over as executive producer, and then your continued engagement with fans I have hope again. So I guess I don't have any questions, just want to let you that I can't wait to see what the next game is going to be like. Also, I realise there is a ton of requests by fans on what should be in the next game which is great, just make sure it isn't bloated with content. Only add top stuff (in my opinion anyway, i'm not a game dev).\n\nThanks for sparing us your time!\n\n### Comment ID fs82lpc with +60 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs82lpc/) (in reply to ID fs7uxvx):\nThanks for that awesome comment!

If you can find 2K19 for dirt cheap I would at least recommend giving it a try.

It seems like such an odd thing to not add when in real life the Superstars always change hairstyles and shave or let them grow, or changing makeup, especially when trying to create attires changing since those options would be a big help to change their look or even update their look if it ends up being outdated after the game’s release. \n\nIt’s never been in any of the previous games so I was wondering if their was a reason for not adding this, since it’s kind of one of the most requested things for superstars creation suite I’ve seen through the years of the games releasing.\n\n### Comment ID fs7uhl9 with +118 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7uhl9/) (in reply to ID fs7nngd):\nAs you might imagine, likeness rights are highly sensitive where real people are involved.

For example, say both you and your opponent are heavily damaged in your match, and you hit your finisher. Instead of being able to immediately go for the pin, your wrestler has to recover and crawl his or her way over to the opponent, leading to more drama and more realism. Or possibly random injuries during matches in Universe and the highly requested GM mode, forcing you, the showrunner, to make a change of plans to a rivalry or title contendership?\n\n2) Any chance we could get more than 2 attire slots for custom wrestlers?\n\n3) The PS3/360 games had little to no trouble adding a custom music option, but it hasn't appeared since the jump to PS4/Xbone. Is this a WWE mandated decision or just something unable to be done on the console. I'm sure you're aware how disappointing it always is for a large number of users in the community who love using indy/classic wrestlers and they aren't able to import those wrestler's themes into the game. \n\nThanks for taking the time to answer the community!\n\n### Comment ID fs82fyn with +143 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs82fyn/) (in reply to ID fs7y0qt):\nCore gameplay is one of the major investments we’re making in the next installment—one of six pillars we are focused on disproportionately in development. We are looking at much-loved previous games like No Mercy or Smackdown: Here Comes the Pain, along with top franchise installments, and more modern wrestling and fighting games to build an all-new philosophical foundation for the game. People who hope that we holistically adopt the control scheme or philosophy from one of their favorite games are likely to be disappointed; we are trying to combine the best ideas out there into a brand new wrestling experience that sets a new standard.\n\nThe game play team is focused on Accessibility, Depth and Wrestling Experience. For Accessibility, we’re obsessed with a simple, intuitive interface which has meaning and depth in a wide variety of contexts—i.e. the game is a lot smarter about what the player is trying to do given a gameplay situation (in a grapple, on the ropes, against a turnbuckle, etc.), with consistent inputs regardless of situation. New players should be able to accidentally pull off awesome moves just by playing with and experimenting with controls.  \n\nFor Depth, we’re looking a lot at ring position, deeper combos and “working” moves, limb damage, technical capabilities, match momentum and unlocks, and rock-paper-scissors (RPS) strategies by archetype and player style. Depth doesn’t come from the manual skill of pressing the proper buttons but from the psychological game of anticipating and countering your opponent’s strategy, and this needs to be built in from the very foundation, so expect a significant evolution in gameplay with the next installment.\n\nThe last aspect of great gameplay is capturing the essence of professional wrestling, which has dimensions of drama, changing context, massive roster, backstage action, weapons and props, audience participation and spectacle. One of the huge challenges of the franchise is finding ways for players to feel in control of the vast number of potential outcomes in a given match. While we take lessons from fighting games, action RPG’s and other genres, this aspect helps us stay focused on delivering a through-and-through wrestling game. While we’re determined to deliver the spectacle and specific moments of a genuine match, I can say we’re trying to get away form UI popups or mini games to represent things like pins or reversals, and instead move those concepts into more fully-realized mechanics which feel like extensions of the main experience.\n\n#### Comment ID fs8mddi with +21 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs8mddi/) (in reply to ID fs82fyn):\nThis is the best thing I've read so far about what you guys are working towards.

At the five-month mark, the team had delivered six major patches (seven if you count the Day 1 patch), and four installments of downloadable content. We reached a point where the biggest issues we were seeing had to do with memory overruns with custom characters and arenas. Fixing these issues would require us to change file formats, branching our code in such a way that improvements to 2K20 wouldn’t carry forward into the next game (and could potentially invalidate existing community creations). We were also facing the reality that maintaining older code was preventing us from making bigger, more comprehensive changes that were required to set a new direction. Finally, given we had made the decision to skip a year before the next release, we had used almost half of the additional time we had to make the next project great.  \n\nWeighing all of this, and in discussion with the team leadership, I felt the best thing would be to turn our focus to the next project. I know this isn’t the news a lot of you wanted to hear, so just trying to be transparent and direct about some difficult decisions we had to make to try to set us up to deliver the best possible results in the future.\n\n#### Comment ID fs7vehg with +92 score by [(CarlaSevilla86, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7vehg/) (in reply to ID fs7uydl):\nLook, I really appreciate you coming to Reddit to give all fans an explanation, regardless of whether we like the result or not.

This new era of transparency is greatly appreciated.\n\nWith that being said, my impression of the feedback process prior to this new direction is that the advisors/influencers and the community would pass along their suggestions to the dev/design team through the feedback project and company events, but somewhere between the dev team and the ultimate decision makers was a disconnect that often left the community feeling unheard.\n\nWhile the new direction seems promising, what steps are being taken to ensure that the flow of ideas and feedback will ultimately impact the game. I guess in alternate terms, could you describe the planned feedback implementation process? How do you decide which features make it into the game and which ones to pass up for the time being?

On our end, we’re doing some things I don’t think we’ve ever done before, including scraping feedback, and prioritizing according to mentions. We’re also sharing some of this back out to the community, so you’re seeing the same information we’re using to prioritize our development. Of course there are no guarantees that all feedback from the community makes it into the game. We have to fold community feedback in with development priorities, and more general research and feedback we use internally. Ultimately, the evidence will be in the game, but I can assure you we’re looking at player feedback more closely than ever.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID fs7tzy4 with +26 score by [(GlorioleJumper, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7tzy4/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nI was massively disappointed to see no cross generation support on the top requested feedback items for community creations. I love creating CAWs, but it’s so draining recreating the same guys year on year from scratch when the background infrastructure is the same. There’s no recreation support and it hurts at times, I.e. no scales or numbers to help recreate faces and bodies, it becomes so hard to match a face year on year. Items of clothing aren’t numbered or named and often move on the list. Movesets despite being the same in the background takes ages to replicate with no support.\n\nIs there any plan to introduce ways to help content creators import something/anything to the next game in the series to help support this? \n\nI love the creation suite, it’s just a huge shame and a drain to restart from scratch each and every year.\n\n### Comment ID fs82rem with +58 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs82rem/) (in reply to ID fs7tzy4):\nFrom the online producer:  As an online producer, the concept of cross platform community creations is exciting to us as well!

I think it's so significant to the entertainment form in general, and to the history of WWE. Isn’t that everyone’s?\n\nI don’t have as much to draw on for a favorite match as most fans, but I loved Edge vs. Orton at this past Wrestlemania. I thought they did the impossible, delivering that kind of intensity without an audience. \n\nFor storylines, I admit to a (maybe) bizarre fascination with The Undertaker, and the storylines and rivalries associated with him. \n\nLess of a storyline but a persona, I’ll say I think Finn Balor and the demon persona (with ties to Finn MacCool, and Balor, king of demons—Irish mythology I grew up with), are just phenomenal. I was also hugely impressed by Balor’s statement of inclusion at Wrestlemania 34. In spite of how exotic the demon persona is, I think Balor reaches levels of authenticity few other superstars can touch.

I know people want features, match types, ect. but is the team looking at the bread and butter of a true wrestling game? Improving gameplay, AI, collision, hit detection, targeting.   I look at past games like SVR 2006 being pretty good at AI and even 2019 was decent  but 2020 seems like a big step backwards and AI is just a punching bag.

(Gauntlet,Casket,War Games,street fight,Special Guest Referee , Winner Takes All ,Buried Alive,Ambulance,K.O.T.R, Fight pit,strap,etc.)\n\n2.How likely could you guys implement a feature where we could use our own custom music for our superstars entrances? (Basically using Spotify)\n\n3.Is it possible to be able to create our own stories and be able to upload them to community creations for others to download and be able to use?\n\n4.Since other games have been implementing crossplay, could we see that implemented into community creations and online mode?\n\n5.Can you please have NO limit on how many superstars/other things you can download in a day and also,NO limit on the amount of superstars/other things you can download from community creations completely not just in a day Just get rid of them entirely please? The reason I say this because for many years community creations would have a limit to how many you things you can  download and it ruins the whole point on being able to download creator’s superstars and other creations when there is a limit\n\n6.Is the expectation that you guys are looking to massively change how the next Wwe2k game will be on the next generation consoles since your game will most likely release a year after they release or are  you guys expecting it to just be a port to next gen with basically nothing new but maybe slight improvements?\n\n### Comment ID fs7xrnn with +70 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7xrnn/) (in reply to ID fs7mxs2):\nMatch types are derived from AI logic, physics, arena layout and other elements which then get crafted into rulesets for specific matches.  We are putting a ton of emphasis on core gameplay at the moment, and will need to rebuild match types based upon our new systems.

However, I feel like an important question that should be asked is, have you guys played any of the older non 2K WWE titles such as the SVR titles, No Mercy, Here Comes the Pain, Day of Reckoning, etc. as well as the older 2K titles from 14-19? If so which one was your favorite, what was your favorite mode and why did you enjoy it so much?\n\n\nMy second question is that I saw in the thread you started about the face morphing and create a superstar that your sir has been playing the games and have been creating in the various modes. What new features/improvements have you yourself wanted to add to the game and what is something that the community is asking for that you feel should be added. One of my favorite modes is create a title and I have had an idea for you guys to do a sort of 3D emboss tool that would allow flat images to become 3D, with the edge color of the image being the color for the shapes sides in the 3d space. This would allow for us to take flat pictures and make new belt plates to match new ones that appear on TV that may have a unique shape not seen in any of the templates of create a title.\n\nFinally #3, will 2k20 get ANYMORE UPDATES. I mainly play 19 but I know there are many who still play 20 and would love to hear any kind of news regarding this.\n\nThanks again!\n\n### Comment ID fs7zjhe with +65 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7zjhe/) (in reply to ID fs7mz87):\nFrom a Design Lead:\nMany of us on the team have been playing wrestling games dating back to the days of the NES. We actually have a N64 and GameCube in the office and will occasionally play No Mercy, Day of Reckoning 2 & Ultimate Muscle (AKI's last wrestling game).\nAKI's output on the N64 are some of my personal favorites as they were mechanically sound games that were more accessible than many other wrestling options that have come before & even after. The AKI games also did a fantastic job capturing the spirit of wrestling and had an incredible roster.\nIn terms of modes, very few games have achieved the open-ended nature and freedom of Here Comes The Pain. That's a personal favorite. SvR 2009 and 2010 Road to Wrestlemania's were great as well as they really embraced the theater of wrestling.\n\n#### Comment ID fs81rx0 with +26 score by [(kiwiguy187, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs81rx0/) (in reply to ID fs7zjhe):\nThe match physics in smackdown vs raw 2011 were the best in the series. The freedom of movement when executing moves was unparalleled and only featured in that game. Lift a guy up with any move and you had total 360° choice where they landed.\nIt also applied to the weapons too.

I posted earlier about some of the comprehensive changes we're making to gameplay. It's still early days, but our initial results are super encouraging. To your second question, we're taking a hard look at how reversals work, to create a reversal system that's more deeply integrated with the overall flow of combat.  We're also looking at match length, and systems which allow for shorter, more dominating matches. Regarding four, we're looking at all aspects of core combat, so expect improvements there as well.\n\n## Comment ID fs7ohot with +16 score by [(the905guy11, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7ohot/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nWill you do open and honest during development of the next 2K game?

In a normal year, servers from a previous game would come down in March, so that they can be used in testing the next installment. That’s why some people saw an automated message related to 2019 over the past few weeks. We’re planning to keep the servers up for as long as we possibly can, but they will have to come down at some point so we can get ready for the next game.\n\n## Comment ID fs7tw05 with +7 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7tw05/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nHello Patrick, I’m really happy and hopeful that you’re the person in charge now. You seem to legitimately care about what we want in this community. I have a few questions, if you’re able to answer them that’s great. Thank you!\n\n1. Was there a reason it took 12+ years (5 during 2K’s takeover) to at least acknowledge that a wide portion of the fan base have wanted and begged for a GM mode? It felt like it was purposely ignored until you stepped in.\n\n2. What’s stopping 2K from releasing monthly/quarterly updates that include things like new wrestlers, updated characters models and even things like championships and move sets and putting them out as DLC? I can understand that the wrestling games are supposed to take place during a time period, so if you keep them updated the end of 2K19’s roster would just be 2K20’s starting roster, but what about when it comes to certain situations like someone getting a new haircut or entirely new gimmick right when the game comes out?\n\n3. In future MyCareer modes, can it be possible that we use wrestlers who are already in the game instead of a custom character? Some people just don’t enjoy using someone that isn’t real. That’s why some people prefer a Season Mode or Road to WrestleMania.\n\nPS. I’m sure a lot of us miss the roster reveals SummerSlam weekend that show actual character models and small clips from the persons entrance when announcing they made they cut. Instead of what’s been going on lately where it’s just a bunch of text dropped on a website. Just a little thing if you’ve never heard of them doing it back when THQ was around, it was a really cool.\n\nThank you for doing this again, we all appreciate you here!\n\n## Comment ID fs7vhev with +23 score by [(TonyPizzaGuyYT, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7vhev/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nI know you are new to the franchise, but why hasn’t online been a focus of the WWE 2K franchise?

I feel like the big disconnect between the consumer and devs is that we as fans get so excited for what will be in the game coming up, but we literally do not hear a single word about the game until June, and wait till a month before release to even get a full roster. We hear almost nothing about new features (which have been lacking since the switch to new gen but that’s for a different time) and we literally get 0 communication which i feel causes a huge problem because what we expect or want, never even happens, but i feel like it could be fixed with proper communication between devs, and fan base. \n\nAs i’m sure you’re aware the weekly product is constantly changing, it would also be nice if we got updated attires, entrances, moves etc instead of waiting a whole year to try out some things. this could also be addressed by allowing us to use Spotify or uploaded MP3’s in the game for entrance music, and allowing us to use the edit superstar feature to edit a superstars likeness completely. \n\nAlso I urge you guys to please try and capture the feel of a WWE show in the games. I would never know i’m at WrestleMania doing Hogan vs Austin because of how dead the game feels. Even the most simple wrestling things like strike sequences, and proper chain wrestling aren’t in the game. I really hope these things can be fixed especially if this game is going to be called a simulator. \n\nThanks for doing the AMA btw man, so far you’ve been so awesome about interacting with us and showing a true interest in our franchise!\n\n### Comment ID fs88nwq with +26 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs88nwq/) (in reply to ID fs7o9my):\nI hear you on the updates to development. As a fan of other franchises, I know I love to have a constant flow of information that lets me know what's happening in development. We have a commitment to improve on that front for the coming game, so expect to get a lot more insight along the way. At the same time, if I'm honest, there are times when we really have to be heads down creating the game, and have less time than we'd like to have a dialog with the community. I'll also say that we want to hold some things back, and this is primarily to make the experience of some key reveals as thrilling as we can. Ultimately, we want to create an experience for players that extends outside the boundaries of the game.\n\n## Comment ID fs7woid with +13 score by [(davereveiws255, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7woid/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nJust 2 questions sir!\n1.

I love professional wrestling in general in the unique way it spans the globe, and merges sports and athletic competition with big personalities, storytelling, and drama, all of which translates really well to games.  At its core, it's takes elements of the best genres of video games, combat, story telling, drama, and spectacle. A good WWE game offers the experience of BEING the Superstar, not observing the Superstar. Every decision and movement can feel important and visceral. The approach to the next WWE 2K franchise game will view WWE as a real competition, with high stakes, pain, rivalries and drama and we want the player to feel invested in all of it.\n\n## Comment ID fs7nf71 with +24 score by [(LemonFoxyTasty, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7nf71/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\n1.

When the audio team talks about what they’re trying to achieve with Commentary, you get a ton of domain-specific lingo, like beer tasting or something (except that instead of “catty” or “resinous” or “malt backbone,” you hear terms like “move call” or “grunt harvest” or “one-shot”). To give you an idea of the scope and complexity, Move Calls, for example, have over 44,000 unique calls. A simple move call like, *“Big hit there by The Rock!”* might be three seconds. If that’s the average across all calls, that would represent about 36 hours of audio, maybe 10-12 days in a recording studio with months of dialog editing and implementation after that. While these are huge systems, we have plans underway to improve and modify, and especially to do a better job of synchronizing crowd animated and audio responses.\n\n## Comment ID fs7nuq2 with +15 score by [(Krushhz, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7nuq2/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nOutside of producing the exciting modes and match types that we all want in the game.

It’s extremely cheap and frustrating. Reversal Burner moves have run rampant throughout this game for YEARS. \n2. A spamming detection system needs to be in place.

It’s one of the biggest questions I asked when I first started. Basically, “Is it theater, or is it sport?” In all our discussions, we came down on the side of sport. We want to focus on the authenticity of rivalries, athleticism, and the experience of being a superstar, locked into meaningful combat in front of an audience of thousands.  \n\nWhen we describe the core focus of the next game, we sometimes use the phrase, “Step out of the crowd, step into the ring.” This reflects an effort to move a little bit away from the audience/broadcast experience, and toward the superstar experience. This central focus can affect our approach to almost every aspect of the game.

To the point where I just turn it off and play music - the commentators repeat the same lines, you can tell they're reading a script and the natural back and forth they should be having just doesn't work.\n\nAnd then there's the crowd - who just hops up and down the entire time which isn't realistic. Make them sit in their seats and then rise to their feet and get loud during the big moments and the near falls. Like an actual audience would.\n\nAre there any plans to fix this to make it feel like an actual TV experience?\n\n### Comment ID fs86pkf with +37 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs86pkf/) (in reply to ID fs7o6pd):\nFROM AN AUDIO TEAM MEMBER ON THE WWE2K TEAM:  \nRegarding commentary, we are aware of this and we are working on creating much improved and enhanced reactions to better suit each situation. The past two cycles we have made progress on a new foundation to build on, and we're focused on expanding content to support more situations in our next title. As for crowd, we are currently updating our crowd systems to sound fuller and more responsive to specific action taking place.\n\nAddressing repetition in content is a major focus for the commentary team and something we're excited about as it's a major part of bringing realism to the experience and a more organic representation of broadcast. Both interruption and branching commentary elements, along with repetition in content is a major focus for the next title.\n\n#### Comment ID fs875us with +18 score by [(coreyputney, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs875us/) (in reply to ID fs86pkf):\nThis is excellent, thank you so much.

Over the years, we've seen almost all of the past hairstyles from the in-game female superstars added to the creation suite (2K15 into 2K16, 2K16 into 2K17) but over the years the number has gotten smaller and smaller and we come to see a lack of new exciting additions to the creation suite. Creating women, in my opinion as well as the communities, is a far more tedious process than other creative aspects due to the fine details from hair, to make up to their intricate ring gear. Will we see any new developments and new ways to utilize and maximize the creation suite for women in the future?\n\n### Comment ID fs81uir with +28 score by [(2K_refbump, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs81uir/) (in reply to ID fs7xw0x):\nThe character creation suite is getting a ton of focus for the next iteration.

Having said that, I’m deeply sympathetic and impressed with the level of effort and dedication that went into the game. Game development is not an exact science. There are tons of projections, estimations and tradeoffs that don’t always come together the way you hoped. Often—very often, actually—the primary tension is between the ambition you have for a project, and your ability to achieve the full scope of that ambition. I think 2K20 had a very ambitious team that was passionate about delivering something awesome—and big—to the community.  \n\nI can tell you that I believe this team has an amazing game in them. At every level, and in every discipline, I’ve met and gotten to work with people I consider to be true experts in their craft.

If so, what games are influencing your decisions?\n\n## Comment ID fs7u9iy with +2 score by [(YepNo1, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7u9iy/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nCan we see special referee matches making a return in 2k22?\n\n## Comment ID fs7vpwg with +2 score by [(pornreactor, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7vpwg/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nWhy don't the WWE games under the 2K banner don't get the same love as NBA games do?\n\n## Comment ID fs7vtx3 with +2 score by [(Izzetgod, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7vtx3/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\n**Question 1**    \nCan we expect any updates during the yearly releases of games such as updating a superstars look to match their new look after a game has been released? (An example being like if 2K22 releases and the following month a superstar shaves their head. Then an update provides the change to the superstars look)\n\n**Question 2**    \nWith the game soon being on next gen consoles (not sure if 2K22 will be for PS5 or Xbox Series X) will the new consoles be able to provide us the gameplay that 2K has been striving for along with hosting all the game modes and features fans want?

Like every superstars current theme and the one before it for people who like to do older gimmicks.)\n\n-Option to select a hairstyle previously used on a character, I know that adding major changes to a character is hard to get the license to do but this could be a way to also fix that (example Seth Rollins hair options could be his current hair, his Shield hairstyle with the blonde, etc.)\n\n-Customize make up color for in game superstars (a color slider would be useful here. I use Maryse a lot and kinda hate that dark lipstick...give us the option to make it different colors)\n\n-Create a manager entrance (I would like to have a custom entrance for my manager and I but you can't select the managers to put on a team and make one. I think that a manager entrance option would be great. Also more intergender entrances would be awesome too. \n\n-No exclusive entrances!

I’m just wondering if the team is carrying on using the same engine that has been in use for a few years now with incremental upgrades each year or if you’ll be building a new engine?\n\n2. Have you ever thought about bringing in something like NaturalMotion’s Euphoria engine to make the physics that bit more realistic?\n\n3. How possible is it to include occasional updates to superstars in the next game to keep them up to date? Not being a developer or really knowing much that goes into it all apart from the basics that most know I wonder how much of a hassle say sending someone out to a WWE show and say scanning someone’s new tattoo or freshly shaved head and then adding them in say a monthly update to keep the models somewhat up to date. I think we all remember Baron Corbin shaving his head like a few weeks of 2k19 coming out and having that “well sh*t” reaction knowing we’d have to wait a year to see the little change come into effect\n\nThanks for taking the time to listen to the community, it really shows you’re properly getting stuck in and taking feedback to heart 👍🏻\n\n## Comment ID fs838tq with +2 score by [(ACaulkGoblin, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs838tq/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nNot sure if this is over with or not, but Hey Patrick my name is Nate, I’m one of the mods here and a huge fan of pro wrestling and wrestling video games.

I was disappointed 19 didn’t offer any new stage parts, as the same with 20. To me it almost feels that Create An Arena is the ugly step child of the creation suite. Going forward will Create An Arena have less restrictions, and more to it?

Example: 2K18 > 2K19, the amount of time you could record in HR was increased and the \"slow mode\" preview we were getting was fixed. 2K19 > 2K20, those innovations were just completely taken away and we ended up with a worse version than the 2K18 one. \n\nGames like Fortnite are expanding their player base because they have such an in-depth HR/theater mode. It naturally draws the creative types to the game when there are tools to use to make unique content.\n\nWhat does the future hold for Highlight Reel in the WWE 2K series?\n\n\\- BrokenFunBash\n\n## Comment ID fs7qiit with +2 score by [(daddymeltzer, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7qiit/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nI have a few questions\n\n1. When is GM Mode returning?\n\n2. Will 2k bring back custom music?\n\n3. When is there going to be more match types such as special referee, I Quit and Buried Alive?\n\n4. Will there be match types to match the current WWE events such as the Boneyard Match or the WWE HQ Money in the Bank\n\n5.  Will CM Punk be in the next game?\n\n6. Will you be able to edit pre existing wrestlers haircuts and facial hair in creation mode?\n\n7. Is it possible to implement Championship entrances into advanced entrances?\n\n8. While I love the simulation style of 2k19, I also loved the arcade style and match freedom of older WWE games would it be it possible to have more freedom in matches, such as jumping off a helicopter like in HCTP or freely climbing on tables without OMG Moves? Combining the simulation style of current WWE games with the arcade style of older WWE games could potentially make 2k22 the best wrestling game ever.\n\n9.

Are you going to do everything that you can in order to give that to us? Because let’s face it this community can eat you up and spit you out. We all just want an enjoyable game with features that we’ve been craving for for years and we haven’t gotten them.\n\nGM Mode, an In Depth Career Mode (we’ve gotten that bitch it’s just not what we thought it should be), missing match types, a Universe Mode that’s Playable and so much more.\n\nAll I want to ask is that if there is going to be a version for the next consoles that’ll be out for almost a year when this next game (assuming it’ll be WWE 2K22) comes out.\n\nThere’s no excuse as to why it wouldn’t be because of the consoles are out for almost a year you’d hourly be looking at that engine.\n\nAlso another question I have is that can you please make the commentary better? I keep hear Michael Cole, Byron Saxton, and Cory Graves say the same lines over and over again and it’s not even realistic! I hit a DDT and Cole called it a suplex. That’s not even the same move.\n\nAnd another question is can you please make the crowd more electric? The Crowd in WWE 2K19 & 20 from what I’ve heard is after like 10-15 minutes in a match (if it lasts that long) the crowd goes completely silent till you hit a signature or finisher. And then they pop for it but then goes dead silent after that move is done. The crowds at a WWE Event aren’t silent as I have been apart of many WWE Crowds when they have come to CT. So please fix this issue.\n\nOh and one more question is can you please update WWE 2K19 with the WWE 2K20 Superstars? I know that’ll take a lot of work but let’s face it... no one plays WWE 2K20 any more. It’s unplayable. An updated WWE 2K19 with the roster, arenas, and more would not only make me happy but a ton of people in the WWE Games Community happy as well.\n\nI want to thank you for all you have done so far keeping us in the loop when it comes to this upcoming installment in the WWE2K Franchise. You’re already doing leaps and bounds better than any other person in 2K as they have been hiding stuff from us for years. You keep us informed and we will show love back. It’s that simple.

I'm an actual ring announcer & I would love the opportunity to truly give fans the most immersive/in depth announcing experience ever. I truly feel and belive that the ring announcing in wwe games SHOULD ALWAYS be done with 100% maximum effort, & even extra special at ppv events like Royal Rumble, Wrestlemania, SummerSlam, Survivor Series etc. I promise you that if given the chance I would absolutely & unequivocally provide the best possible experience ever in that regard in wwe games, further more my objectives would be to make sure the players feel as if they're at an actual event. No two intros of the same person or anyone else would ever be exactly the same. Everything should be unique and have it's on special feeling. Just look at my you tube page GoldenTalkTv....my work speaks for itself. Thank you so much for your time and have a fantastic day and stay safe! \n\nP.S.

The originals idea was awful to be honest, I've had the series every year for 23 years and that was the worst addition I have seen. What people want is a better creation suite, gm mode (this is the biggest one) and the old match types like buried alive, inferno etc. back in the franchise, I'd say those are the big ones. Also why is there no guitar weapon anymore!?! Elias is in the game and that should be Incentive enough to have a guitar added. Last thing, the controls. Please put them back to the way they were before 😂 what you have to remember is while a small percentage of people will be picking up the game for the first time, it's all about keeping your current clientele happy, the majority of people that purchase the series have played it before.\n\n## Comment ID fs7veu9 with +1 score by [(Goodaa123, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7veu9/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nIs a new engine in the works?

It’s way too easy to reverse in the new games, even with the Ai reversal boosted and being on legendary.\n\nThe pinning system now is horrendous, just make the green kickout box THE SAME DAMN SPOT EVERY TIME and just have it get smaller and faster the more you advance but at the same time, don’t make it a centimeter because chances are you can dominate a match for 20 (if it doesn’t crash by then) and they’ll have kicked out of every signature and finisher and they’ll pin me twice and it’s all over because you have it set up so terrible.\n\nI probably have the most hours on WWE 2k20 on Xbox one than most people in the community, what you’re trying to do is good but where we are now is terrible!

That they pushed WWE Originals as this big groundbreaking feature, but it wasn't a part of the actual game. It was DLC. It was pre-planned paid content that you didn't get with the actual full price of game. So the game was basically no different than the previous years outside of a new story mode. I think it was a very cheap tatic to get people to spend more on the game. \n\nI'm an old school gamer so I feel that DLC should complement the main game, not be the biggest feature you want to play. That would be like bringing GM mode back but as DLC. Going forward what are your plans with additional content that is paid for dlc. Will it be for main features or for things like updated looks/etc?\n\n## Comment ID fs81nhq with +1 score by [(childishboyjay, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs81nhq/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nNow i doubt a lot if focus would be put in 2k19 but will there be more updates to 2k20\nBlood\nUniverse crashing\nVideo creator crashing\nMy online match crashed once\nThere are certain points in a match where someone kicks out and rises like the undertaker while the other  person is frustrated for the pin\nMore creation slots maybe??? \nAn 2006 john cena would be nice\nA 2006 kane\n\n## Comment ID fs81qqz with +1 score by [(Abdi-Omar, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs81qqz/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nHi Patrick can we keep the Concept of keeping Attires from previous games going into Next Gen Consoles since WWE 2K15 this has been one of the best things about the Creation Suite for many years for example all of AJ Styles Attires from his previous games dating back to his debut in 2K17 are all in WWE 2K20 this allows us to freshen up his Look when we so choose with a variety of options without having to rely on Community Creations this has been a great tool for current gen and it would be great to continue maintaining it\n\n## Comment ID fs81r1y with +1 score by [(ECKO_MARTiNEZ, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs81r1y/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nAre you guys using any older wrestling video games or wwe stars that play the game like Xavier woods on what they think could improve in today’s games?

Just got two questions for the time being:\n\n1. With 2K21 being skipped over for the more arcadey Battlegrounds this year, is the plan as is right now to do a WWE 2K game every two years to give more development time, or is this just a one time thing for now with the plan to go back to a WWE 2K simulation every year?\n\n\n2. With the overall legends selection within the WWE 2K franchise shrinking the last two years, was just curious about the process of selecting or signing legends for these games. Is getting legends something is responsible for getting independently with a fixed budget where guys like Hogan just take up more money to sign and so cuts are needed? Does WWE have much say in who you guys select for the game in general? \n\n\nThanks!

Is there ways where we can realistically have ways in which we can include superstars as in gear types/styles , hair , Makeup , accessories , I know it’s a lot of work to include superstars as it takes time but have you guys thought about this alternative? We would also love a better creation suite with multiple fabric/material types , better clothing options in which we have full control , we should have control over the way we want gears to fit (tight , baggy , slim , length , style) not only that , the hairstyles should be more customizable in which we can control the length , size , & overall look when it’s placed on a superstar! Lastly , as a personal problem I’ve had , I would like more space when it comes to image uploading into the game and an easier way to import other content when other creators upload gears , we should have an option to copy and paste without actually having to go into create a superstar and changing the gear to ring attire/manager attire!

I love to play wwe games online. I especially loved wwe 2k14. \n1. Can we see an adjustment to reversals? Especially any form of major reversals? On paper. It sounds good. But Ppl cheese them. So they do a finisher and pin. No skill needed. And most likely win. It’s the meta of online play. I hate I have to do that. Can we see major reversal ether adjusted or completely removed in the future games? Unblockable attacks work in other fighting games. Just not in WWE games.\n\n2. Also for online. Make it so reversals limits are the same. Or gone. I hate being a normal superstar with 3 bars. Just to fight a guy who put six reversal bars in his character.\n\n3. Remove the hud for the opponent so I can’t see what’s his momentum and vice versa. So when finishers occur. It’s a surprise. And not coz I saw they had it stored. Older wwe games like WWE 2k14 did this perfectly.\n\n## Comment ID fs85ahs with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs85ahs/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nThanks for doing this AMA Patrick, just one quick question.\n\nWill we be seeing some sort of cross-play integration between the different consoles and PC in time for the next WWE game?\n\n## Comment ID fs85jj9 with +1 score by [(Otb_liljosh13, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs85jj9/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nRoad to wrestlemania online, gm mode online?

Can we get accurate versions of wrestlers for what they used to look like. For example Kurt Angle '06 and Kurt Angle '01 simply just has hair on his head another issue is that both Kurt Angle character models are using Kurt Angle's recent face scan this really throws off the authenticity and experience of the game. We basically end up with a character model that's supposedly supposed to look like what they looked like from the year 2001 using a recent face scan and we end up with a product that's off you can still see the aging of the wrestlers. Samething with The Rock and The Rock '01 he simply just has hair on his head and you can still see the aging on the younger model aswell. We want these characters designed from the ground up because we obviously can't get or use a face scan. Can we also get more retro wrestlers like retro Thuganomics Cena retro Here Comes the Pain Brock Lesnar. Debut of retro American badass biker Undertaker the best version of the biker Undertaker in the year 2000 that version of him in WWE 2K14 and in SmackDown 1 and 2. Batista from his Evolution days and his Smackdown days when he had hair.

In years before this, 2K would always claim to be \"listening\", but little to no changes or improvements would be made, and the only changes there *would* be, would be changes that nobody asked for (or even wanted)- but the fact now that they're actually showing/proving to us already that they're going to listen to us is a massive shot of hope, adrenaline and genuine excitement, and quite honestly seeing the passion and excitement pouring out from Patrick's answers (and just 2K hiring him in general) has me very optimistic about the WWE2K Games' future.

I hope these are more questions than they are just me hawking my suggestions, but you know how it goes on these things.\n\n1) Are there any plans to make the wrestler AI feel more unique and individualized? When I'm fighting Rey Mysterio, or when I'm fighting the Big Show, I don't see any big difference in tactics or match flow besides the stats and the moveset. But sim sports games have always had stuff like tendencies, and at least some percentage of WWE games players are also Fire Pro World players, which gives you an unbelievable amount of customization on enemy wrestler AI/what AI vs. AI matches will look like. I also think old PS2 era WWE games got around this okay by making extremely  exaggerated animations of signature moves for the stars (Rock, Lesnar, Goldberg etc). For me, it seemed wild that people were getting up in arms about not getting to play as Lio Rush in 2K20 when playing as/against Stone Cold Steve Austin hasn't been exciting in 15 years.\n\n2) Any plans for create a story? I know it was supposed to be buggy/laggy in the X360/PS3 generation, but I think it would have been such a big hit with streaming. IIRC the VGCW guys got big right before Twitch became a thing, then the next versions of the game got rid of CAS. I can see the potential problems with content moderation, etc.\n\n## Comment ID fs7p4ns with +1 score by [(FrancisTB45, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7p4ns/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nAre there plans for a future general manager feature in the next-gen consoles?\n\n## Comment ID fs7p4oc with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7p4oc/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nIn regards to tag teams, factions, and other groups -- why do past teams not get included as entrances (moves, music, etc.), presentation and everything to do with teams feels like no one cares?\n\nFor instance, X-Pac is included in 2K20, but there is no Kane & X-Pac entrance. No movement and no music for them to enter together. Evolution is similar, you have Batista, Flair, Triple H and Orton, but no Evolution entrance movements.

Do you consider it a priority?  It hasn't really been touched in the last 15 years and is one of the blandest parts of the gameplay.  It's whoever can move their bar in the right direction or mash buttons the fastest.  There is so much more strategy to submissions in real life and so much that could be improved upon.  I'm hoping it has a renaissance by the time the next game launches as it has been ignored for far too long.\n\n## Comment ID fs7qgg2 with +1 score by [(nv____, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7qgg2/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nSince it isn’t feasible to get rid of the download limit can separate them?

This a concern of mine since polling showed this very low. I am hoping this will be addressed as the possibility of full body morphing being added brings the concern of disturbing creations that I do not want to see, and I am also concerned children should not see. The second question is in regard to whether or not someone  on the WWE 2k team or with some of the power users would do some basic tutorials on how each of the create a modes function. Personally I think if you do they should posted on a 2k resource page somewhere. Finally regarding Spotify if you are to do a Spotify integration would you need premium to use it?

So iv a number of questions but feel free to answer any ones you like\n1) Will the focus just be next gen(PS5 etc) going forward? I personally feel like this is necessarily because of how much work the game needs and I would worry that cross gen development will hinder development\n2) My Career has not exactly been a success and I was wondering if it will be continuing or get replaced? Preferably with a season mode or some sort\n3) For me Universe mode has been the most important mode because of longevity and as a single player gamer I hope there can continue to being long term single player modes going forward, I sometimes feel like the games focus does more so be on short term modes like Showcase/MyCareer story/2KOriginals etc and was hoping that will change going forward\n4) is there any plans to rebuild the game from the ground up because the engine has been pretty flawed in the past? Kind of links to my Q1 as to why I hope the focus in next gen going forward as the game needs a lot of work.\n5) Something more light hearted but have you any favourite Wrestling games yourself and any particular feature/mode that you yourself want to bring to the game?\n\n## Comment ID fs7sslb with +1 score by [(Mintydeadman, Reddit, 2020-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/gsvli0/im_patrick_gilmore_game_industry_veteran_and/fs7sslb/) (in reply to ID gsvli0):\nWhen is WWE 2k19 going back on sale?

And universe just needs time put into it.\n\n### Comment ID jb1xqrr with +4 score by [(donteventrydad, Reddit, 2023-03-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/11j3iyc/i_like_the_newer_2k_games_especially_universe/jb1xqrr/) (in reply to ID jb19ea6):\nLet’s hope ‘23 delivers in the Universe aspect, all we can do there.\n\n## Comment ID jb1ei1s with +22 score by [(NoTaserNo, Reddit, 2023-03-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/11j3iyc/i_like_the_newer_2k_games_especially_universe/jb1ei1s/) (in reply to ID 11j3iyc):\n2K14 was pretty much damn near perfect in my eyes.

If you liked 2K22's more arcade like style, then you'll probably like 2K14 as it was the last to have that style as 2K15 went more simulation. It's also got a good roster as the 30 Years of WrestleMania gave you lots of legends from Hulk Hogan to Big John Studd to Goldberg (these guys were gone for YEARS). \n\nCreation is fine as you got Superstar Threads, allowing you to have three attires of recolored attires. Superstar Heads was introduced, which is just a precursor of today's creation systems, but very limited on you can use with it. Also the only way to play as Roddy Piper. Story designer and Create a Finisher make their last appearance.

They haven't focused on gameplay ever. in 2K20 they focused more on Bump in the Night DLC and all that crap not realizing that it didn't mean a damn thing if the gameplay sucked.

      "# Post ID 18lq7b7: I think finishers should change in 2k Games with +13 score by [(MostSky1651, Reddit, 2023-12-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/18lq7b7/i_think_finishers_should_change_in_2k_games/)\nNow I’m not saying the current finisher system is awful, but it definitely needs an upgrade. It feels like in the modern state in the WWE or wrestling in general finisher are triggered from many different spots during the match  example of this would be Roman reigns, and how we can do his spear from virtually any moment at any time. \n\nI personally, don’t like the idea that we can only hold two finisher slots per wrestler my personal idea to make this better would be to have custom and specific superstar, finisher packages. What I mean by this is that we are able to put three finishers into one package and make that a whole finisher in itself. I also think it would be dope if every superstar was able to have two finisher packages as well. \n\nWith Roman reigns for example he uses the spear most of the time to end his matches, but on some occasions, he has also used the guillotine choke. Being able to access all these different types of spears and chokes, as a way to end matches would be such a cool, add on to the gameplay aspect of 2K. \n\nAnd this can be used for many other superstars like Wes Lee with his patented, cardiac kick, which in the game you can trigger from running, and a corner running strike. Making a finisher package would give you the ability to add his third finisher the spiral tap to everything and make his character complete when ending matches. I also think you should do the same with signatures as well because they both work the same pretty much. Thank you for reading my Tedtalk.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID kdzfcht with +8 score by [(LDQuang2711, Reddit, 2023-12-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/18lq7b7/i_think_finishers_should_change_in_2k_games/kdzfcht/) (in reply to ID 18lq7b7):\nTrue.

He was meant to be in Smackdown 2 as a legend, but all the legends got cut (the others were Andre, Slaughter and King). He was then probably meant to be in as a manager in 2K18, back when he was managing Darren Young, as the 'Darren Young with Manager' entrance motion was in 2K18 - they probably cut him because Backlund stopped managing young way before the game's release and Young was on his way out.\n\n#### Comment ID lrpc71d with +1 score by [(TruthComet, Reddit, 2024-10-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/1g2fd2p/whos_a_wrestler_thats_never_been_in_the_2k_games/lrpc71d/) (in reply to ID lrp3iyk):\nI think of think of Bob Backlund as the Bill Belichick of WWE/WWF.  \nWhile Bill Belichick was in the Madden games early in his coaching career, he spent the next 20 years refusing to be in Madden games, even as an active head coach the entire time, while every other head coach was in the games.  Someone asked him why he’s not in Madden games and his response was “You’ll have to ask John Madden that.”  Just speculating but I think he was probably asking for an unreasonable amount of money to allow it to happen.  Or he doesn’t like or respect video games.  Or maybe both, who knows?  \nI think those same reasons are probably why Bob Backlund has never been in a WWE/WWF video game.  You have to think that it’s highly intentional, on Bob Backlund’s part, that he’s never been in any WWE video game over the last 20 years since legends have become so common in these games.\n\n## Comment ID lroidhr with +12 score by [(Woolf_22, Reddit, 2024-10-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/1g2fd2p/whos_a_wrestler_thats_never_been_in_the_2k_games/lroidhr/) (in reply to ID 1g2fd2p):\nHey guys, Maven here.

Judy Martin & Leilani Kai, 2x tag champs. \n\nJudy, imo, is one of the most underrated women of the 80s. She was a good heel… worked the crowd well, sold well and looked intense in the ring. Mannerisms on point.   Looking back at her matches she reminds me a lot of Sherri when she was wrestling, in terms of how she interacted with the audience. Her tough face mixed with her cowardly run away Schtick during matches was great.\n\nWWE really missed the boat on inducting them the year the tag titles were introduced, imo. They’re both still around and deserve that moment, in hoping they’re eventually recognized.\n\nThey were two if the few women to have a real gimmick in the 80s (during the Glamour Girls era), they had Jimmy Hart as their manager (some of the few in that era to have a manager)… really unfortunate their work is slowly getting lost to time.\n\n## Comment ID lrpe2mr with +1 score by [(Mediocre_Comment3412, Reddit, 2024-10-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/1g2fd2p/whos_a_wrestler_thats_never_been_in_the_2k_games/lrpe2mr/) (in reply to ID 1g2fd2p):\nThe tag team kronick if they’ve never been\n\n## Comment ID lrpfjjw with +1 score by [(Own_Travel1484, Reddit, 2024-10-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/1g2fd2p/whos_a_wrestler_thats_never_been_in_the_2k_games/lrpfjjw/) (in reply to ID 1g2fd2p):\nVictoria\n\n## Comment ID lrpi1ri with +1 score by [(RAGEleek, Reddit, 2024-10-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/1g2fd2p/whos_a_wrestler_thats_never_been_in_the_2k_games/lrpi1ri/) (in reply to ID 1g2fd2p):\nJames ellsworth.

They debuted in January of '07, but for some reason weren't considered for the SvR 2008 game roster. They were Tag Champions for the majority of '07, but went on a losing streak during the '08 Road to WM, and for some reason weren't considered for the roster of SvR 2009 (the Tag Team game!). After WrestleMania 24 (which they competed at), they broke up and most of the trio were gone by late '08, meaning they weren't even close to appearing in SvR 2010.",

It’s disappointing that all those development resources went into a pointless “story” when the developers could have focused on giving players more awesome tracks and cups to enjoy. The underlying racing mechanics are so very entertaining. Instead, though, we have a familiar story: a massive space to “explore” but no meaningful reason to do so. Developers, if all you’re going to do with open worlds is dump busywork on players and use it to pad out the number of hours it’ll take them to finish the game, then find a different format. Not everything needs an open world, and I would argue that arcade “kart” racers are a good example of that.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesHub](https://opencritic.com/outlet/847/gameshub)** - [Leah Williams](https://opencritic.com/critic/8973/leah-williams) - [4 / 5 ](https://www.gameshub.com/news/reviews/lego-2k-drive-review-campaign-racing-mode-2616307/)\n\n>At times, the game devolves into weirdness, but that’s part of its charm.

Something questionable, in a game so oriented to children.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Press Start](https://opencritic.com/outlet/491/press-start)** - [Kieron Verbrugge](https://opencritic.com/critic/4101/kieron-verbrugge) - [8.5 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/ps5-reviews/2023/05/14/lego-2k-drive-review/)\n\n>LEGO 2K Drive is a wildly impressive triple threat of a great LEGO game, a great open-world adventure and a great racing game. Whether you want to challenge your friends in slick and exciting head-to-head races, tackle a hefty single-player campaign stuffed with varied and plentiful content, or just spend hours building your own LEGO vehicles by the brick, you're absolutely covered here. A couple of issues aside, this is easily the best multiplatform arcade racer around.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Outerhaven Productions](https://opencritic.com/outlet/335/the-outerhaven-productions)** - [Karl Smart](https://opencritic.com/critic/2157/karl-smart) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://www.theouterhaven.net/2023/05/lego-2k-drive-driving-with-bricks/)\n\n>LEGO 2K Drive is a great racing game. The world that is built using a combination of LEGO bricks and real-world objects is stunning and looks like some kid or LEGO hobbyist, made this world in their own home. However, once the game tries to do something that is not racing using a racing control system, that's when the wheels fall off this particular LEGO racer.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheGamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/731/thegamer)** - [Stacey Henley](https://opencritic.com/critic/7588/stacey-henley) - [2.5 / 5 ](https://www.thegamer.com/lego-2k-drive-review/)\n\n>There is a lot here for a young kid to enjoy, especially one who is tuned into Lego. The tracks have solid variety, both in terms of aesthetics, obstacles, and various challenges (like lacking destructible items to fill the boost bar), but it barely matters when you'll win every race until you hit a progression wall that asks you to grind out cash generation or pay to skip it, and then start winning again. It's creative, but it's also a bit of a mess. Lego 2K Drive mixes Forza Horizon and Mario Kart together, but it's not as good as either of them, and doesn't bring much new to the table either. There are building blocks here for Lego to use for future IP-less games, but this doesn't quite put them all together in a way that will interest anyone who isn’t still in primary school.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Cody Medellin](https://opencritic.com/critic/4182/cody-medellin) - [7.5 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2023/5/15/reviews/137195-xbox-series-x-review-lego-2k-drive/)\n\n>LEGO 2K Drive is a fun romp if you know what you're getting into. The racing is fast and exciting, and the catch-up code seems tuned just right. The open worlds provide a ton to do, and the freeform exploration and destruction makes driving around feel enjoyable. The amount of grind needed to make some real progression can drag down things in the intervals, when there are no story-based missions. Some of the quests that aren't strictly related to racing can be very hit-and-miss in terms of enjoyment. The presence of microtransactions is unsettling to see in the publisher's non-sports titles. If you can ensure you aren't tempted to buy new cars due to the paltry reward payouts, you'll have a very good time with this racing title.\n\n-------------\n\n## Comment ID jkcswke with +275 score by [(rumsbumsrums, Reddit, 2023-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13j2u91/lego_2k_drive_review_thread/jkcswke/) (in reply to ID 13j2u91):\nWith all this monetization bullshit you would think it's at least F2P for some fun arcade racing in the side.\n\n\nNOPE, 60-120€ full price for the privilege of being milked even further.\n\n### Comment ID jkd0fm8 with +171 score by [(macarouns, Reddit, 2023-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13j2u91/lego_2k_drive_review_thread/jkd0fm8/) (in reply to ID jkcswke):\nIn a game aimed at children no less…\n\n#### Comment ID jkd73mv with +50 score by [(Varizio, Reddit, 2023-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13j2u91/lego_2k_drive_review_thread/jkd73mv/) (in reply to ID jkd0fm8):\nApperantly companies only learned one thing from that smurf app game scandal years ago....\n\n### Comment ID jkcz83n with +44 score by [(KeepDi9gin, Reddit, 2023-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13j2u91/lego_2k_drive_review_thread/jkcz83n/) (in reply to ID jkcswke):\nI remember when some accepted the $70 price hike because there would be less of this (in their minds).\n\nI knew better.\n\n#### Comment ID jkdd4zk with +31 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13j2u91/lego_2k_drive_review_thread/jkdd4zk/) (in reply to ID jkcz83n):\n>I remember when some accepted the $70 price hike because there would be less of this (in their minds).  \n>  \n>I knew better.\n\nRecently Nintendo hiked their price to $70 and you've already got people defending \"well, it's only for their premium games\".  \n\n\nI know better.

Stir the pot on social media and let the company know that we no long want a game that only benefits them but instead we as consumers want a game for US.\n\nWe all know how much 2k loves their money..now can you imagine what they would do if they were no longer acquiring that money? Or as much as they used to ?\n\nI'd bet you we would get the best basketball game in years to enjoy.\n\nIt's been too long.\n\n### Comment ID igu31qo with +1 score by [(behemoth619, Reddit, 2022-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/w31574/nba_2k_releasing_mostly_the_same_game_every_year/igu31qo/) (in reply to ID igtmsbd):\nBingo\n\n### Comment ID igup76m with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/w31574/nba_2k_releasing_mostly_the_same_game_every_year/igup76m/) (in reply to ID igtmsbd):\nwell put\n\n### Comment ID igwm0y2 with +1 score by [(officebeats, Reddit, 2022-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/w31574/nba_2k_releasing_mostly_the_same_game_every_year/igwm0y2/) (in reply to ID igtmsbd):\nFor this reason the game should go free to play.

They could stand a tiny increase in defense. Tiny as fuck. cpus could use work adjusting to habits and more realistic movement on courts and working on getting better open shots when the shot clocks low. Physics, graphics.

I've had multiple people tell me that they didn't understand what they were supposed to be doing in their new roles as the org restructured for the third time. \n\nLack of Development Opportunities: They've discussed something about career paths but nothing has come of this in years.

Water seeks its own level. And the watermark is high here.\r\n\r\nEveryone here has met two tenets: Exceptional talent and exceptional character. We have a no a-holes policy. No level of skill or ability excuses toxic personalities. We believe Trust matters most towards an environment of psychological safety where we can take risks to innovate and grow to achieve excellence in all we do.\r\n\r\nWe laugh a LOT here and we work hard. We believe that you can bring your best and whole self to work and that will make you, the team and game better. We value each other as people first. \r\n\r\nI truly look forward to going to work every Monday. I've been fortunate to work in an Industry I love for many years. I'm even more fortunate to be happier than I've ever been in my work at this stage of my career. \r\n\r\n31st Union is a unique team of amazing people. I'm grateful and humbled to be a part of it.",

      "# [2K Games' motion capture studio votes to unionise by James Batchelor on 2024-11-25](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/2k-games-motion-capture-studio-votes-to-unionise)\nWorkers at 2K Games' California-based motion capture studio have successfully voted to unionise.\n\nFollowing the news last month, the election was supervised by the National Labor Relations Board and the action was approved on Friday with a vote of 15 for, 6 against.\n\nThe 2K Mocap Union will unionise under the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which claimed in a statement that this will be the first unionisation of a motion capture studio in the games industry.\n\nBased in the Californian city of Petaluma, 2K Motion Capture Studio has worked on many of Take-Two's biggest franchises, such as NBA 2K, WWE 2K and BioShock.\n\nFollowing the unionisation, the workers will enter negotiations with 2K management to agree on a new contract, with the union pushing for better job security, fair pay and improved working conditions.\n\n\"Today it is evident that the people at this studio truly want what is best not only for themselves, but what is best for their coworkers, future generations of workers, and the studio as a whole,\" said 2K motion capture animator Matthew Peterson. \"Whilst this campaign has not been without its challenges, it is inspiring that the core driving force of this movement is empathy for one another.\n\n\"I look forward to negotiating in good faith with Take-Two, and I hope that other workers in our industry will feel inspired to organise and gain the protections that are necessary not only to survive, but thrive.\"\n\nIATSE International president Matthew D. Loeb added: \"This victory is not just about one studio; it’s about the future of work in the video game industry.\n\n\"2K MoCap workers have shown what many other entertainment workers already know — that collective action is the best way to secure fairness, equity, and respect in the workplace. Their courage will inspire others in the industry to follow suit.

      "# [‘WWE 2K’ Franchise Coming to Netflix as Streamer Also Sets ‘Ginny & Georgia’ and ‘Sweet Magnolias’ Mobile Games by Jennifer Maas on 2025-01-30](https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/wwe-2k-netflix-games-ginny-and-georgia-sweet-magnolias-1236290318/)\nNetflix is further expanding its partnership with WWE with a new exclusive deal for the mobile versions of the popular “WWE 2K” video game franchise.\n\nMade by Take-Two Interactive’s 2K Games studio, the “WWE 2K” mobile games will be available to Netflix subscribers beginning in fall 2025. This furthers Netflix’s relationship with Take-Two, which also has the rights to the mobile versions of the “Grand Theft Auto” franchise, which is developed by Take-Two’s Rockstar Games label.\n\nOn the originals side, Netflix is continuing to grow its lineup of games based on its own IP with upcoming mobile titles adapted from TV series “Ginny & Georgia” and “Sweet Magnolias.” These will launch under the streamer’s “Netflix Stories” collection, a catalog of interactive fiction games mainly based on romance and dating-focused series. Additionally, Netflix will release “new original stories” for its existing “Love Is Blind” and “Outer Banks” mobile games that are part of the “Netflix Stories” franchise.\n\nAll of these new titles join more than 100 Netflix games, both original and acquired, currently available on the streamer’s app. Netflix’s mobile titles are available to subscribers without any ads or in-app purchases.\n\nIt’s still early days for Netflix’s gaming business, which is led by Epic Games vet Alain Tascan, but the division has recently seen big success with the release of “Squid Game: Unleashed” ahead of Season 2 of “Squid Game” in December. The game is already tracking to be Netflix’s most-downloaded game to date. Per Sensor Tower, “Squid Game: Unleashed” bested “GTA: San Andreas” by approximately 50% in number of downloads during the games’ respective first 30 days post launch on Netflix.",

      "# [The 2K Launcher Is No More — You Can Now Launch 2K’s PC Games Directly in Steam by Wesley Yin-Poole on 2024-11-26](https://sea.ign.com/bioshock-2-remastered/222788/news/the-2k-launcher-is-no-more-you-can-now-launch-2ks-pc-games-directly-in-steam)\n2K Games has pulled its launcher from all its PC games as part of a “complete sunset” of the software, which means PC gamers can now launch all 2K games directly in Steam.\n\nThis means Bioshock Remastered, Bioshock 2 Remastered, Bioshock Infinite, The Quarry, and Marvel’s Midnight Suns will now all launch directly into the game as soon as you click Play. The Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition games on Steam and the Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition games on Epic each have slightly different paths to getting into the games.\n\nCivilization 6 on Steam had the launcher removed earlier this year, so no additional steps are needed. But for Civilization 6 for Epic, it now directly opens into the game when launched from Epic. Civilization 5, meanwhile, now uses the Steam Launch options to open the game.\n\nXCOM 2 for Steam is a special case, 2K said, as the launcher included Mod support functionality. Of note, these changes will let you enable mods on the Steam Deck. XCOM 2 on Epic will now open the Original XCOM 2 Mod Launcher. XCOM: Chimera Squad also has the Mod launcher as optional, with a secondary option available to directly launch the game. Mods are also available on Steam Deck for Chimera Squad.\n\nIn a blog post, 2K said it had replaced the 2KLauncher folder with a text file called 2kLauncherRemoved.txt, which can be safely deleted. But there may be more for you to do — 2K said to be sure the launcher is gone for good, close and reopen Steam then reboot your PC.\n\n“We've done the heavy lifting, but to take it all the way home there might be one step left for you,” 2K explained. “First thing is to try closing and reopening Steam - that means completely closing and not just using the X to minimize the platform. Rebooting your PC is a good way to be sure it happened. For Epic, just make sure you've downloaded the most recent update for the game.”\n\nSaved games shouldn’t be impacted, and you won’t lose access to any of your games, as long as you bought them on Steam or Epic. And, for those (probably very few!) PC gamers who miss the 2K Launcher for some reason and want to continue using it, unfortunately it’s not coming back. “We currently have no plans to allow an optional 2K Launcher setting, but we appreciate your interest,” 2K said.\n\nThe end of the 2K Launcher comes ahead of the release of Civilization 7 in February 2025. Civilization is usually one of the most popular PC games around, so fans can rest assured they’ll be able to launch it directly in Steam.\n\nPC gamers have long criticized publisher launchers, including Ubisoft and EA’s, that force themselves upon players before they can get into the game. It seems unlikely the end of the 2K Launcher will spark a mass removal of PC launchers, however, given they’re often used for cloud saves or storefronts."

With upcoming titles like Borderlands 4 and Civilization VII, alongside ongoing support for NBA 2K25, the company is poised for continued growth and engagement with its player base. Prospective candidates and investors should consider 2K's robust portfolio and proactive approach to industry challenges as key indicators of its future success."
