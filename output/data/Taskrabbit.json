  "summary_markdown": "# About Taskrabbit\n\nTaskrabbit, founded on January 1, 2008, by Leah Busque, is a platform that connects individuals with local freelancers, known as \"Taskers,\" who can assist with various tasks. The company was acquired by IKEA in 2017, which has influenced its focus on home-related services, particularly furniture assembly and moving tasks [(Crunchbase, 2024)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/taskrabbit). Taskrabbit operates in thousands of cities across nine countries, including Canada, France, Monaco, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and is available in over 200 IKEA stores worldwide [(Crunchbase, 2024)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/taskrabbit).\n\nTaskrabbit's primary product is its online platform, which facilitates the connection between Taskers and customers. Users can book services through the website or app, often with same-day availability. The platform operates as a two-sided marketplace, where clients can post tasks and Taskers can accept them. Taskers are independent contractors who set their own rates and schedules, providing services under their own names rather than Taskrabbit's brand [(Taskrabbit Global Terms of Service, 2024-02-21)](https://support.taskrabbit.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008913792-Taskrabbit-Global-Terms-of-Service).\n\nTaskrabbit serves a diverse customer base, including individuals needing help with everyday tasks and small businesses looking for assistance. The platform is designed to cater to various needs, making it a versatile solution for many. The company generates revenue by taking a percentage of the fees paid to Taskers for their services, operating primarily in a B2C model.\n\nThe company has been recognized for its workplace culture, being honored in Built In’s 2024 Best Places To Work Awards for the third consecutive year [(Taskrabbit Blog, 2024-06-11)](https://www.taskrabbit.com/blog/taskrabbit-news). Taskrabbit promotes a culture of safety, reliability, and community support, encouraging Taskers and customers to follow public health guidelines, especially during the pandemic.\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nAnia Smith has been the CEO of Taskrabbit since August 2020. She has emphasized the importance of flexibility and autonomy for Taskers, highlighting the platform's role in providing meaningful income opportunities [(Poinski, Forbes, 2024-04-07)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/04/07/taskrabbit-ceo-talks-about-the-evolution-of-gig-economy-companies/). Her leadership has been pivotal in navigating the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the evolving gig economy landscape.\n\n# News\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n1. **Partnerships**: Taskrabbit has partnered with Cachet to offer customized insurance packages for Taskers in six European countries. This initiative aims to provide financial security for gig workers, covering income loss due to accidents and offering long-term disability support [(Ben-Hutta, Cachet partners with Taskrabbit, 2024-09-23)](https://coverager.com/cachet-partners-with-taskrabbit/).\n\n2. **Service Demand Trends**: The platform has observed a significant increase in demand for baby-related services, with a 25% rise in nursery setup bookings and a 56% increase in baby-proofing jobs in early 2024 compared to the previous year [(Newman, Retail Brew, 2024-06-11)](https://www.retailbrew.com/stories/2024/06/11/why-taskrabbit-is-stepping-on-the-gas-with-retail-partnerships).\n\n3. **User Experience Enhancements**: Taskrabbit has introduced features such as automated cancellation fees for clients who cancel tasks within 24 hours, streamlining the payment process for Taskers [(Beier, Tasker Roundup, 2024-11-06)](https://www.taskrabbit.ca/blog/tasker-roundup-6-updates-you-dont-want-to-miss/).\n\n4. **Acquisition**: Taskrabbit has taken over the on-demand moving service Dolly, expanding its service offerings and market reach [(Soper, GeekWire, 2024-11-07)](https://www.geekwire.com/2024/taskrabbit-quietly-acquired-on-demand-moving-service-dolly/).\n\n## Financial Performance and Scale\n\nWhile specific revenue figures for Taskrabbit are not publicly disclosed, the platform has seen substantial growth in its user base and task volume. In 2023, a Tasker reported earning over $47,000, indicating the potential for significant income through the platform [(Weiss, Business Insider, 2024-12-16)](https://www.bundle.app/en/finance/i'm-a-retiree-who-assembles-furniture-on-taskrabbit-to-avoid-draining-my-retirement-fund.-at-79-i-a-0905a185-9806-45a9-b86d-74b8195d3057). The company continues to expand its reach and service offerings, suggesting a positive trajectory in terms of financial performance.\n\n## Market Position and Competitors\n\nTaskrabbit operates in a competitive landscape with several alternatives, including Handy, Thumbtack, and Care.com. While Taskrabbit is primarily focused on one-off tasks, competitors like Handy offer a broader range of home services, including ongoing maintenance and repairs [(ServiceTitan, 2024-09-24)](https://www.servicetitan.com/blog/taskrabbit-competitors). Taskrabbit's unique positioning as a platform for quick, flexible tasks, particularly in the home improvement sector, allows it to maintain a distinct market presence.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTaskrabbit has established itself as a leader in the gig economy, particularly in the home services sector. With a focus on enhancing the Tasker experience, expanding service offerings, and forming strategic partnerships, the company is well-positioned for continued growth. Prospective candidates and investors should consider Taskrabbit's innovative approach to the gig economy and its commitment to supporting its workforce as key factors in its ongoing success.",

      "# [About TaskRabbit: Who We Are and How We Got Here.](https://www.taskrabbit.com/announcements)\nAs restrictions are lifted across regions and cities, we ask the TaskRabbit community to remain mindful of all public health guidance and regulations in your area, especially since they may change from one day to the next. If your area allows in-person contact, please feel free to book these tasks. However, if a task can be done in a contactless or virtual way, we encourage taking these precautions.\n\nA contactless task is one that maintains social distancing of at least 6 feet/2 meters from another person. For example, you can request your Tasker perform the task outside, in a separate room, or offsite (e.g. leaving a delivery at your door). Instructions for contactless tasks can be indicated in the booking details and/or via task chat.\n\nYou may also request that a task be done virtually via chat, a call, or video. For example, you can have a Tasker complete data entry or personal assistant work virtually or guide you through a furniture assembly via a video call. Just let your Tasker know in your task description how you’d like to complete the task virtually.\n\nIf you are experiencing symptoms of illness, please let your Tasker know. Both you and your Tasker should take appropriate precautions to perform the task in a contactless or virtual way.\n\nThese are uncertain and confusing times and we want to do what we can to provide you with information to help you and your business get through it. The information below is our effort to share recent financial assistance programs that may be of interest to you as an independent contractor and user of the TaskRabbit platform. TaskRabbit is, of course, not affiliated with the financial assistance programs listed here, and cannot advise on program eligibility or how to apply for any of the programs listed. Please consult the programs directly with questions or concerns.\n\nGiven the unprecedented impact COVID-19 is having on peoples’ livelihoods, governments worldwide are taking measures to provide economic relief to individuals, families, and small businesses. Although not comprehensive, below is a list of potentially helpful government resources in the U.S.\n\nSummary: The U.S. has enacted two pieces of legislation - the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act - which include a wide variety of relief options, such as loans, grants, unemployment benefits, and deferred taxes for the self-employed, including independent contractors like you.\n\nAs a user of the TaskRabbit platform, you provide your services to your clients as an independent contractor. Furthermore, you are operating as a business entity — usually as a “sole proprietor.” Please find additional information in Sections 1 and 2 of TaskRabbit’s Terms of Service, as well as this Support Center article on Sole Proprietors.\n\n• Families First Coronavirus Response Act \"FFCRA\": Includes tax benefits for eligible small businesses (fewer than 500 employees) and a refundable tax credit provision for eligible independent contractors.\n\n• Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ‘‘CARES\": Includes a Federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program to provide compensation to eligible workers impacted by COVID-19, including self-employed independent contractors. Also includes the Small Business Administration’s new Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Emergency Grant Program.\n\nPandemic Unemployment Assistance: Self-employed individuals, including independent contractors, typically are not eligible for unemployment benefits, but the CARES Act for the first time broadens the eligibility guidelines to include Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) for independent workers. The program runs through December 31, 2020, and provides retroactive benefits from January 27, 2020. The U.S. Department of Labor issued guidance that expressly directs states to make PUA available to independent contractors and other self-employed individuals. The Unemployment Benefits Finder helps you learn how to file for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance in your state as an independent contractor. Note the current unprecedented demand may cause delays in application processing and receiving funds.\n\nAdditional resources\n\n• House Ways and Means CARES Act UI FAQ site\n\n• House Ways and Means CARES Act UI FAQ doc\n\n• Internal Revenue Service FAQs for Self-Employed Individuals\n\n• U.S. Department of Labor COVID-19 Resources\n\n• U.S. Department of Labor Unemployment Benefits Finder - Includes links and contact information for filing for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance in your state. Note that states are in the process of updating their websites to reflect these newly expanded benefits.\n\nSmall Business Assistance: There are two loan options available to self-employed individuals through the CARES Act: the Paycheck Protection Program, and the Economic Injury Disaster Loans and advances.\n\n• Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans: The new PPP loans are designed specifically to provide small businesses, including independent contractors and individuals operating as sole proprietors, with cash support. The PPP loans will be available through approved banks and credit unions, so consult with yours directly to see if they are participating in the program. Importantly, loan payments may be deferred and almost the entire amount of the PPP loan may be forgiven (no payback requirement) when applied toward qualifying expenses, which can be found here in the “Loan Details and Forgiveness” section. Additional resources:\n\n• U.S. Treasury CARES Small Business assistance\n\n• U.S. SBA District Office List\n\n• Treasury Department’s borrower fact sheet\n\n• Chamber of Commerce’s complete guide to the PPP\n\n• Chamber of Commerce’s PPP checklist\n\n• SBA PPP website\n\n• Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) and advances: EIDLs are low-interest, flat-rate loans that can be used to cover expenses like paid leave, payroll or lost revenue due to the pandemic. There is also an option to apply for an advance on the loan (which is being called a grant) of up to $10,000 which, when used on covered expenses, does not have to be paid back. Additional resources:\n\n• SBA EIDL Website\n\n• Chamber of Commerce step-by-step application guide\n\n• EIDL terms and conditions\n\n————————————————————————————————————\n\n“Self-employed individuals” as defined in 20 C.F.R 625.2(n) means individuals whose primary reliance for income is on the performance of services in the individual’s own business, or on the individual’s own farm. These individuals include independent contractors, including “gig economy” workers, and workers for certain religious entities.\n\nAdditional measures in the FFCRA and CARES Acts\n\n• Paid sick and family leave tax credit: The FFCRA entitles eligible self-employed individuals to an income tax credit to offset their federal self-employment tax for any taxable year equal to their “qualified sick leave equivalent amount” or “qualified family leave equivalent amount.” See IRS paid sick leave FAQs for the self-employed for additional information.\n\n• Tax filing deadline extensions: The IRS has moved the tax filing deadline for individuals and businesses from April 15 to July 15, 2020. Additional resources: IRS Filing and Payment FAQs and IRS Tax Resources (see the Tax Help section).\n\n• Payroll tax deferments: The CARES Act allows employers and self-employed individuals to delay certain types of payroll taxes. Specific requirements for tax filings are pending from the IRS. For more information, check the IRS coronavirus tax guidance page.\n\nState-level assistance: Note some states in the U.S. are offering additional assistance for the self-employed and small businesses including, for example, California and Illinois.

Deceptive Billing Practices Ruined My TaskRabbit Experience, 1 stars [(Angel UT Longhorn, Apple App Store, 2024-03-17)](https://apple/11056391707)\nI recently used TaskRabbit to hire a tasker for some yard work, and what I thought would be a convenient and straightforward experience turned into a nightmare of hidden fees and deception. As a customer, I value transparency and honesty, but TaskRabbit failed miserably in this regard. Firstly, the advertised hourly rate of the tasker conveniently omitted significant additional fees, including a whopping \"Trust & Support Fee\" that was nowhere to be found during the browsing process. This fee, which amounted to a staggering 37% of the tasker's hourly rate, was only revealed after I received my inflated invoice. This blatant lack of transparency is nothing short of deceitful. Furthermore, the sales tax was also sneakily added to my bill, further inflating the cost of the service without any prior disclosure. Such hidden charges significantly tarnished my trust in TaskRabbit and left me feeling betrayed as a customer. TaskRabbit needs to understand that honesty and transparency are paramount in building and maintaining customer trust. Concealing fees and misleading customers is not only unethical but also undermines the integrity of the entire platform. I urge TaskRabbit to rectify these deceptive billing practices immediately and provide full transparency regarding all fees upfront. Customers deserve to know the true cost of the services they're purchasing without any unpleasant surprises. Until then, I cannot in good conscience recommend TaskRabbit to anyone, and I will certainly be seeking alternative options for my future tasks. TaskRabbit, you've lost a once-loyal customer due to your dishonesty. It's time to clean up your act and prioritize integrity over profit.",

Deceptive Billing Practices Ruined My TaskRabbit Experience, 1 stars [(Angel UT Longhorn, Apple App Store, 2024-03-17)](https://apple/11056391707)\nI recently used TaskRabbit to hire a tasker for some yard work, and what I thought would be a convenient and straightforward experience turned into a nightmare of hidden fees and deception. As a customer, I value transparency and honesty, but TaskRabbit failed miserably in this regard. Firstly, the advertised hourly rate of the tasker conveniently omitted significant additional fees, including a whopping \"Trust & Support Fee\" that was nowhere to be found during the browsing process. This fee, which amounted to a staggering 37% of the tasker's hourly rate, was only revealed after I received my inflated invoice. This blatant lack of transparency is nothing short of deceitful. Furthermore, the sales tax was also sneakily added to my bill, further inflating the cost of the service without any prior disclosure. Such hidden charges significantly tarnished my trust in TaskRabbit and left me feeling betrayed as a customer. TaskRabbit needs to understand that honesty and transparency are paramount in building and maintaining customer trust. Concealing fees and misleading customers is not only unethical but also undermines the integrity of the entire platform. I urge TaskRabbit to rectify these deceptive billing practices immediately and provide full transparency regarding all fees upfront. Customers deserve to know the true cost of the services they're purchasing without any unpleasant surprises. Until then, I cannot in good conscience recommend TaskRabbit to anyone, and I will certainly be seeking alternative options for my future tasks.

When I booked, I saw a “trust & support fee” that was unclear if it was hourly or one-time, it was about $20 compared to the tasker’s hourly rate of about $40. When I tried to look on the TR website about the fee, it also did not specify whether the fee was hourly or one-time. A quick google search confirmed that this is an HOURLY fee on top of the tasker’s hourly rate making my potential lawn guy about $77/hour. Unfortunately I ended up canceling the job and deleting the app. This additional fee just makes all of their taskers too expensive.",

Have fun with thumbtack, where you pay for leads to jobs, even if the client doesn’t actually hire you. Or handy, where you don’t get to set your rates and get charged by handy for showing up 2 minutes late or for needing to reschedule, even in an emergency.\n\nTaskrabbit is deeply flawed, but even with this (small) fee change, they are still far and away the best service of this type with the most contractor freedom. Hopefully they quit shooting themselves in the foot with this app, but for now it’s still the best even if they don’t.\n\nAnd as others have said, the fee increase was only a few percentage points. Previously they added 15% to the Tasker rate as the listed rate the client saw, and then another 15% at the end on the final bill. And 1.15(1.15(TASKER RATE)=1.3225(TASKER RATE). So this new rate is only 3.05% higher (not 5.3% higher as the other poster said) than it was before, it’s mostly that it’s just presented differently. \n\nSounds like you just didn’t know how it worked before or you should have been angry this whole time.\n\n### Comment ID hjymphb with +2 score by [(alpha_seltzer, Reddit, 2021-11-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/qpuivi/best_alternatives/hjymphb/) (in reply to ID hjy7n80):\nHandy was the last one I haven't tried but it looks even worse than takl was. From a client POV, which OP is, the rate increase is worse than that, it went from 30% to 35%, or a 17% increase, with no value added to speak of. If a tasker sets their rate at $100, the client pays $135, with $35 going to the app for each and every hour of work, so it does appear to be a high fee. Even though TR makes more money in that example, it may be scaring clients off, especially since they made the fee more transparent in the hiring process. That may be why they are experimenting with hiding higher rate taskers from appearing in search results at all. Eventually, they will set hourly rate limits for taskers, even if this experiment is itself a de facto limit.\n\n#### Comment ID hjyn43o with +2 score by [(AnAmericanIndividual, Reddit, 2021-11-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/qpuivi/best_alternatives/hjyn43o/) (in reply to ID hjymphb):\nI just noticed that OP is a client so a lot of my post was irrelevant. Good catch.\n\nBut I’m sorry, you’re incorrect about the fee thing. Previously, if I the Tasker listed my rate at $100, the client would see $115 (100 x 1.15), and end up paying $132.25 (115 x 1.15) on the final bill. Now, if I list my rate at $100, the client sees $100, and pays $135.30 on the final bill. And .3225/.353 is only a 9% difference, not 17%. I agree that TR has added no value for that extra 9% fee, but that’s the nature of extractive middlemen and capitalism in general unfortunately.\n\nI do agree that TR is moving in the wrong direction and will eventually do everything they can to limit our rates.\n\n## Comment ID hjzuxsb with +3 score by [(geoffrey8, Reddit, 2021-11-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/qpuivi/best_alternatives/hjzuxsb/) (in reply to ID qpuivi):\nAlso regardless if there is an alternative.

It used to be possible to have above -green-rates and get episodic volume, meaning really treat TR as only 1 of many sources for work… but current practices make than less feasible. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTR’s introduction of pricing guidance wasn’t immediately impactful on it’s own (it started in 2021, as I recall), but in 2022 it was compounded by increasing number of taskers like you who assumed they need to follow guidance, and TR’s combined misguided strategies of Analytics and oversaturating almost all metros with too many taskers. \n\nAs a result, the Sept 2022-August 2023 fiscal year is trending to be at a 20% year-over-year growth rate based on statements from the CEO, v 50% for the Sept 2021-August 2022, and 70% for Sept 2020-August 2021. \n\nIt’s theoretically possible the same leadership that has produced these results could improve…. but,  the trendlines and general patterns are not terribly favorable.\n\n### Comment ID l61e12t with +1 score by [(CharlieFL, Reddit, 2024-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/157z4wt/1_year_review/l61e12t/) (in reply to ID jt7i502):\n\"Because serious clients would prefer to pay a higher rate for a proper skilled job done well.\"  What people charge is NOT an indication of the quality of their work.

If you’re not okay with that or there is no compatible future date, then the Tasker is well within their rights to cancel, and should. Safety first.\n\nEvery Tasker has a different risk tolerance, vehicle, driving skills, etc, so it is impossible to answer your question about whether taskers often cancel for inclement weather. And it isn’t a particularly useful question to ask, since every weather event is also different so other ones will have no bearing on yours.\n\nIf Taskers cancel, they are pretty much always penalized regardless of how much notice there is (at least that’s how it appears, the system is opaque). But safety should come first so they still should if it’s truly unsafe to travel. To be honest, you’re giving off pretty bad client vibes.\n\nIf it’s truly a date-specific task and you’re concerned, try to get some other possible option in place as Plan B.

TR does not directly manage Taskers, and you can find plenty of evidence on here and elsewhere of unhappy customers due to late cancels and no-shows by Taskers.   \n\n\nThe best thing you can do is choose experienced taskers, with high ratings and reviews. That is the best path to high-confidence/trustworthy taskers.  Choosing taskers with low task count and low rates involves more risk.  In smaller, newer-to-TR metros, it may be hard, but being selective is essential.   \n\n\nAfter choosing an experienced tasker, you could share your concern about weather and reliability in the task chat, and confirm they have reliable transportation and are comfortable driving in moderately inclement weather for your location. Obviously, as surely you can understand, TR does support the notion of users -- both clients and taskers -- choose personal safety over tasking, if needed, so there's the simple reality that the weather may not cooperate with your plans.   \n\n\nGood luck!\n\n## Comment ID jbxhf04 with +2 score by [(Desperate_Ad_8065, Reddit, 2023-03-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/11p5fop/weatherrelated_cancelations/jbxhf04/) (in reply to ID 11p5fop):\nI Cancel Any Task I Don’t Wanna Do Or Not Worth My Time And My Profile Works Great.

Business is honestly better than ever for me. I get booked for virtually all of my availability and charge decent rates for my area.\n\nLast month I did 44 jobs, 80 hours, $3k(plus $2-300ish hundred cash/venmo tips). After drivetime and vehicle expenses thats just over $30/hr which is way better than I could do in my area without a degree or experience. Most I've ever made at a normal job was 22/hr but it was way more stressful.\n\nAlso I see so many people complain about the change to hiding fees in Tasker rate that started recently. Is it just me or is that actually great for most taskers? Like the total fees stayed the same at like 40% but now 1. clients aren't driven away thinking fees are higher 2. Percentage based tips mean you get higher tips since its based off of the Tasker rate with fees baked in(im not positive on this?) 3. When quoting off app its less jarring to the clients since fees are baked in. If I'm getting 30 and client see 36 and I qoute 40 off app that seems reasonable, if I'm getting 30 and client sees 32 and I qoute 40 its gonna seem like a big jump for some.\n\n## Comment ID kpfi8ll with +15 score by [(KithMeImTyson, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1alka6v/anyone_else_actually_doing_great_on_taskrabbit/kpfi8ll/) (in reply to ID 1alka6v):\nSo is this the newest crackpot marketing campaign that TR has unveiled, or what?

Is your city’s airport a hub? Likely not. Metro rank is likely not top 25. \n\nNY, LA, SF: account for as much as 50% of TR US activity. \n\nThese metros and the others in the top 10 have significantly different dynamics in play than what is a smaller metro for TR, as you describe. \n\nSearch FA in your city and sort by Completed task count. Get the count of taskers over 500 tasks. Then search LA, SF, NY, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle. There’s a significant difference, right?\n\nTo be clear, that doesn’t mean your experience is not valid, isn’t true, or doesn’t matter. All it means is, the city and the categories matter and comparisons between them aren’t always very meaningful or useful. Your experience doesn’t explain the experience in NYC, and their experience doesn’t explain yours. That’s the key point. \n\nThere have definitely been significant changes in how the platform operates over the years.

We had a similar situation happen a few months ago and had the same Tasker who recognized me from last time. I remember before he mentioned how much he loves his job and that's its the easiest money but he never mentioned the company until today. He told me he got paid $400 to disassemble this bike which took about an hour. I was interested so he showed me around the app and the opportunities that are there. \n\nTBH, it all sounded too good to be true. I used to date a girl who got wrapped up in a pyramid scheme and I can recognize a lot of the signs. In fact, I was just waiting for this guy to give me a referral code or invite me to some meeting but nothing like that. He gave me a business card and said to contact him if I need any help with other assembly related things but that's it, he was just a nice guy.\n\nI've been trying to read reviews online and while there's countless negative reviews from customers who got bad Taskers, I can't find anything from taskers and what they think of the company.

Once you start getting good reviews and a lot more tasks under your belt, it can be pretty lucrative, depending where you live.  TR I think is a gig app that is really close to actually being an independent contractor, unlike rideshare or the food apps.\n\nYou set your rates, you set the area you want to work.  You know exactly what the tasks entails and how long it should take.  There will be clients that mess this up, but for the most part, it's pretty straight forward as long as you have good communication skills and keep the client on the same page.\n\nI did just moving tasks for years, and it was super easy for me to get tasks every weekend without doing anything but being available.  I charged $60/hour, and that was for me.  The client paid 15% above that, or whatever TR additional cut was.  And my rate wasn't even super expensive.  I know a bunch of taskers that were charging north of $80/hour and getting tons of tasks.  It was pretty easy for me to make a couple hundred dollars every weekend if I pushed it.  Now think if you did this full time and charged more because you have the reviews to?  You could easily make this your full time job and make some good money, if you're in a market that TR is popular.\n\nFurniture assembly is also very popular.  So if you can do that and/or moving/heavy lifting, there is some pretty good money to be made.\n\nIf you wanted to try, now would be a good time.  Once spring comes around and into summer, clients love having taskers do stuff.  Moving is super hot category in the summer.  But remember, like starting anything new, it starts out slow.  Don't expect to sign up and instantly get tons of tasks.  You need those reviews to build your \"street cred\"\n\n## Comment ID i4ocjge with +4 score by [(DylanS89, Reddit, 2022-04-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/txsvfh/just_learned_of_task_rabbit_how_is_it_from_a/i4ocjge/) (in reply to ID txsvfh):\nI have a friend who clean for a living ahe started with handy pro(which i dont recommend for cleaning) but she was getting paid terrible money for big jobs but there were some clients she form a relationship with because of her work and end up getting repeatedly clients.

It’s not bad.  You can get hired for just about anything really.  So there’s a wide range of opportunities.\n\nI have next to know real skills and I still get hired at least several times a month.  I usually make anywhere from $200 - $400 in a months time and I don’t really make myself that available because sometimes I’m too busy to even go out tasking.\n\nYou set your own rates, set your work area, what you want to do, when you are available to work, and then wait to get hired.  You might not get any work for that day, or you might get 2 or 3 jobs.  Sometimes I’ll get 2 in one day.  I think I did 3 in one day just once.  Sometimes, it’s hit or miss, but what you want is repeat clients.  That’s where your predictable and regular income comes from.\n\nOn that guy making $400 for the bike dissemble, it’s entirely possible.  You can have your rate maxed out and then charge a 2 hour minimum, then plus a tip, yeah $400 for that job is possible.\n\nPretty much earn as much as you can.  I’d say if you have some real life handy skills, you can probably make much more.  I’ve read some people have made over 100K in a year just working as a Tasker.  I think to reach that, you need to do a lot of tasks and make it your full time gig for sure.  I just don’t have the skills to rely solely on TaskRabbit, but I’m satisfied with where I’m at and I hope it gets better from here!\n\nAlso, where you’re located will matter as well.  Big, urban areas will get more work.\n\n## Comment ID j0n8y4c with +2 score by [(DontRedFlagMeBro, Reddit, 2022-12-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/txsvfh/just_learned_of_task_rabbit_how_is_it_from_a/j0n8y4c/) (in reply to ID txsvfh):\nI do task rabbit on the side. It's got pros and cons.\n\nThe pros are that you can make your own schedule and set your own rates. The cons are that people tend to lie or greatly understate the extent of their tasks. For example, I've had several IKEA assemblies where the client stated that they had 1x or whatever assembly it is. Show up to the job only to find out that it's a totally different assembly altogether, or the item they said they had one of is actually 10.\n\nOne huge downside of TR is that someone can hire you for a job and then be a complete no-show and you just have to eat that time and gas. They say that you may qualify for a cancellation fee but they always seem to have a slick reason  for why you don't.\n\n## Comment ID jjkrpjm with +2 score by [(Silly_Slice_4119, Reddit, 2023-05-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/txsvfh/just_learned_of_task_rabbit_how_is_it_from_a/jjkrpjm/) (in reply to ID txsvfh):\nThey gather all your information first and waste your time before telling you about the fee.

As with any marketplace, there is a wide range of providers. Individual experiences vary widely. So whether or not it meets your judgment of ‘good’, depends on your expectations of a ‘worker’, how many are available in your area to choose from and who you hire. \n\nTR’s fees currently range from 42-49% markup to the rate the tasker sets, some included in the hourly rate you see, some in a separate Trust and Support fee you won’t see until you get to the Confirmation screen in the booking process. They are charged as a percentage per hour, so be aware of that.any clients don’t catch on to this. \n\nTaskRabbit does criminal background checks, but that’s it. No skill testing, etc. So how good the tasker will be varies widely. \n\nConceptually, it’s great.

So you must be careful what kind of work you want done on their platform. \n\nTaskers from Taskrabbit, now that’s a different story and that depends on the type of work you want done.\n\nHighly reviewed taskers with a high task count generally means a quality tasker that will say NO to work they are not qualified to do. \n\nI typically say no to work that I am not qualified to do or where the cost of the service does not align with the “forced” hourly rates. I also reject jobs based on potential liability because of how much is covered by my provider, also just simple risk to reward analysis\n\n## Comment ID l8b39pg with +2 score by [(StartOver777, Reddit, 2024-06-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1de6i0s/is_taskrabbit_any_goodbe_honest/l8b39pg/) (in reply to ID 1de6i0s):\nThanks for sharing\n\n## Comment ID l8fez3v with +2 score by [(Salgatorium, Reddit, 2024-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1de6i0s/is_taskrabbit_any_goodbe_honest/l8fez3v/) (in reply to ID 1de6i0s):\nYou sound like a nightmare to do a task for.\n\n## Comment ID l8r4a0i with +2 score by [(bonitapequena, Reddit, 2024-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1de6i0s/is_taskrabbit_any_goodbe_honest/l8r4a0i/) (in reply to ID 1de6i0s):\nI hate that I have to pay a fuckin 25$ registration fee😭 I’m registering to make money cause I’m poor wtf makes you think I have 25$ to give away for this 😭😭😭😭💀💀💀\n\n## Comment ID lbcx5sp with +2 score by [(ken_ll, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1de6i0s/is_taskrabbit_any_goodbe_honest/lbcx5sp/) (in reply to ID 1de6i0s):\nComplete chaos.

Advice I'd give is to write a legit bio saying what you excel at, clear and inviting headshots right away and before/afters by category when you are able to, and then make sure your rate is low enough when you have no reviews. The app has an algorithm that suggests a range to put based on your popularity, # of recent reviews/feedback, etc and as you get reviews in the app and more search hits you can push it higher.  \n\nAs a more general advice thing, communication is key. I do cleaning and when someone sends me a very low info/general scope request, I reach out right away and start asking questions to make sure I have the equipment needed and that I am willing to do everything they want done. I ask questions about whether they have allergies to chemicals or sensitivity to fragrances, when was the last time the home was professionally cleaned, if there are pets, and more. I have had very few poor experiences and 100% of them could have been avoided entirely by trusting my gut after asking all of my questions and declining it outright. Even though I took one or two against my better judgement, I have 100% 5 star reviews because I communicated to them in advance exactly what I can do, what to expect, and whether what they are asking is realistic for a solo cleaner in the time they have budgeted. And I communicate clear dealbreakers in advance, and have mutually declined jobs that would have been a nightmare and avoided a bad review or a bad client experience. \n\nAlso, because today is tax day....if you start making lots of money, don't forget to set some aside for taxes.

The tasker has to handle their own expense accounting and tax filing to account for the $70 business expense to reduce taxable income. \n\nThe proposed change has no explicit/direct impact;\nIt indicates that a tasker would have to shift to including the use of a vehicle in their hourly rate in a new category.  Details aren’t known yet, but there’s nothing that suggests TR is expect taskers to forego covering use of their vehicle. \n\nThe allusion to Epic v Apple is tenuous at best. \n\nTR is trying to clean-up a mess they’ve allowed to fester and putrify in the Help Moving categories because of their misguided strategies around pricing and ‘market place optimization’ that have consistently reduced growth and diminished the platform for 3.5 years and quite clearly since the 4.X tasker app launched, and the Analytics era of the past two years.  \n\nLegal strategy is about the only domain where they have relatively few gapping issues.

Epic games was mad at Apple’s high fees, they tried to circumvent Apple’s payment system but making their own, and Apple blocked Epic Games products from the App Store in retaliation. Just charging a high fee does not make this analogous at all.\n\nWhy would it be illegal for Taskrabbit to charge their fees on top of the Tasker’s expenses? Can you point to any law in any jurisdiction that says that’s illegal? I’m not saying it’s a nice idea or the financially smartest decision for TR, but for real, how is it illegal? GC’s often charge a percentage fee on top of the hard costs of a job all the time, like charging 15% of the cost of all labor and materials for building a house. Restaurants can charge a service charge that is a percentage of the menu price of your food, which would then be on top of the labor and materials that’s went into your dish. There is no way this is illegal.\n\nFurthermore, this does not prevent the Tasker from accounting for expenses on their taxes in any way. You don’t account for expenses in your tax return by showing the IRS your TR invoices that have separate line items for Tasker rate and expenses. You have to write off the actual expenses you incur, and show proof of them, not write off the amount you charge for expenses. If you actually spend $70 on gas, truck repairs, tolls, etc. then you get to deduct that amount on Schedule C still. If you previously only spent an actual $60 in actual expenses and charged $70 for your truck, you weren’t allowed to write off $70 previously. Literally nothing has changed in your ability to deduct expenses, TR has not affected that at all. You just need to keep detailed records of your expenses as you always should have been doing. I recommend an accounting software, I use QuickBooks Self Employed.\n\nJust want to be clear that I’m not defending TR’s policy choices here, or elsewhere. I just really don’t like the borderline histrionic, sky-is-falling attitude to TR’s recent changes, full of factually false information. Nor do I like the unrealistic “this is illegal, let’s make a class action lawsuit”’responses that keep happening, getting less-knowledgeable people’s hopes up of it going away.\n\n#### Comment ID kxwm0wz with +2 score by [(Masterbourne, Reddit, 2024-04-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1buefuj/new_policies_changing_task_rabbit/kxwm0wz/) (in reply to ID kxv4jj1):\nRe-read what I wrote. I never stated that it was illegal, I asked \"is it legal\", because every real job I had where invoices are filed, your pay and expenses are very clearly separated and itemized, and the company contracting you doesn't charge fees on the expenses because that is not profit. Also, TaskRabbit's stance is laughable when their 40% \"Trust and Safety\" fees amount to \"trust us, give us money if you want to be safe buddy\". \n\nI'm not actually saying that the sky is falling, but TaskRabbit is killing their own platform by making certain tasks not worth doing for taskers, and not worth paying for by clients. The Ikea tasks being a great example. If anyone is doing those, my condolences go out to you. In the case of moving tasks, it will just eliminate all low-value moving/delivery tasks, which is frankly what the bulk of moving tasks on TR are. And for the high-value tasks I'm sure people will find ways to circumvent the system as always. \n\nIn the long run, changes like this prompt the best taskers to leave the platform and make their own business. It is not like rideshare where Uber/Lyft can trap drivers and leech money endlessly.  If the only taskers on the platform left are new/poor performers and the service costs are astronomical, no one will use the platform because they will have abundant better/cheaper options available from the folks that \"graduate\" from TR to an independent business.\n\n## Comment ID kxsbu4p with +6 score by [(FinnNoodle, Reddit, 2024-04-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1buefuj/new_policies_changing_task_rabbit/kxsbu4p/) (in reply to ID 1buefuj):\nAnd how do they propose they get clients to choose the correct category?\n\n## Comment ID kxs93lg with +14 score by [(No_Spare6970, Reddit, 2024-04-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1buefuj/new_policies_changing_task_rabbit/kxs93lg/) (in reply to ID 1buefuj):\nThis is wild!

Many of these tasks take 3+ hours out of your day total and $40-80 in expenses but only generate 1 billable hour. And then regards look at the $100 per hour figure and think that it's overpriced and try to negotiate while the net earnings from the job are closer to like $10 per hour. I'm pretty sure most movers will just be forfeiting short jobs now.\n\n## Comment ID kxvepa7 with +3 score by [(Smurf459, Reddit, 2024-04-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1buefuj/new_policies_changing_task_rabbit/kxvepa7/) (in reply to ID 1buefuj):\nSimple, I’ll keep my rate the same but expense clients through the hourly, and they can’t remove the other moving categories because not all clients require the use of a vehicle!\n\n## Comment ID kxsp7vo with +3 score by [(HeftyGap419, Reddit, 2024-04-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1buefuj/new_policies_changing_task_rabbit/kxsp7vo/) (in reply to ID 1buefuj):\nSo are they getting rid of the Help Moving category or just adding adding a Truck Assisted category?\n\nIt's great in theory, but not all moves are the same costs. If you go to uhaul, penske or budget they have 3-5 different truck sizes at differing costs. On top of that they'll charge different for in-town and out of town moves. How does TR expect Taskers to account for that when clients want help moving between cities? How does TR expect Taskers to account for a move that's 20 miles and one that is 400 miles?\n\nIs the truck fee charged per hour and added in the Taskers rate? If that's the case clients will be paying more with the new change vs the old way. Also, is TR adding on their fee to the truck expense? This just makes it more expensive for the client in the end.\n\n## Comment ID kxuh0ng with +4 score by [(jethropenistei-, Reddit, 2024-04-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1buefuj/new_policies_changing_task_rabbit/kxuh0ng/) (in reply to ID 1buefuj):\nCurious to see if they fix all the other categories that they allow clients to choose vehicles.

Since then, they have banned me for 3 months in ever receiving a cancelation fee should someone decide to take work away from me or screw me over with cancelations.

They are making a new category like “ikea flat rate” but for moving where you will not be allowed to bill expenses. If I have to use this category due to competition then I will be calling every single client and telling them there is an additional fee and collecting payment separately for expenses(yes I know this is against the terms but hey…). There has to be a way around this. If “vehicle fees” are no longer allowed but “expenses” are, what’s to stop taskers from charging “ high gas expenses” instead of a “vehicle fee”? What if a uhual vehicle was requested by the client? Are they saying you wouldn’t even be able to bill them for the cost for you to rent a uhual? We need to boycott this new category. Regular expenses are real things for contractors. They can’t make their own rules on what we can and can’t expense\n\n### Comment ID kxvbsxh with +2 score by [(AnAmericanIndividual, Reddit, 2024-04-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1buefuj/new_policies_changing_task_rabbit/kxvbsxh/) (in reply to ID kxvaijv):\nIf you do this, you’ll quickly get banned after the first client complaint, which will probably also happen quickly. Since I’d expect it will be made clear to the client that the category is intended to have vehicle costs included in the rate.\n\nIn which case, just include your own vehicle costs in your rate.\n\nI agree it makes it tough for UHaul purchases.

Also paying all the taskers the same flat rate as opposed to allowing taskers to set their own rates is a disgusting way to treat workers. Somebody who has been a tasker for years with solid reviews should not be paid the same as a person who just started. Professionals should be able to adjust their rates to reflect their level of expertise.

He didn’t even bother reading the task description or message I clearly detailed I wanted tinted window film added to my single split window. The film was applied with many bubbles and my boyfriend helped him apply it and the service man didn’t even bother cleaning the window before applying the film ! Not as bad as the service man who took 3 days to put up blinds and milked us for over 8 hours of work daily! I’ll find a more reliable app that has replicable services available at better or fairer prices. Also Taskrabbit never returned my email for help asking for the service fee and why it was applied every hour instead of a flat fee them getting a cut of over $50 for a service fee, for every service is bull if you ask me. I thank god nothing went terrible on the tasks because the horror stories of taskers ruining peoples home and Taskrabbit saying they cannot help is bull also so what’s with that dumb fee?!???

          "content": "I recently used TaskRabbit to hire a tasker for some yard work, and what I thought would be a convenient and straightforward experience turned into a nightmare of hidden fees and deception. As a customer, I value transparency and honesty, but TaskRabbit failed miserably in this regard. Firstly, the advertised hourly rate of the tasker conveniently omitted significant additional fees, including a whopping \"Trust & Support Fee\" that was nowhere to be found during the browsing process. This fee, which amounted to a staggering 37% of the tasker's hourly rate, was only revealed after I received my inflated invoice. This blatant lack of transparency is nothing short of deceitful. Furthermore, the sales tax was also sneakily added to my bill, further inflating the cost of the service without any prior disclosure. Such hidden charges significantly tarnished my trust in TaskRabbit and left me feeling betrayed as a customer. TaskRabbit needs to understand that honesty and transparency are paramount in building and maintaining customer trust. Concealing fees and misleading customers is not only unethical but also undermines the integrity of the entire platform. I urge TaskRabbit to rectify these deceptive billing practices immediately and provide full transparency regarding all fees upfront. Customers deserve to know the true cost of the services they're purchasing without any unpleasant surprises. Until then, I cannot in good conscience recommend TaskRabbit to anyone, and I will certainly be seeking alternative options for my future tasks. TaskRabbit, you've lost a once-loyal customer due to your dishonesty. It's time to clean up your act and prioritize integrity over profit.",

The task failed to communicate to me that her current job she was working on got pushed back so that means she wouldn’t have gotten to me until about 930pm \nSo I had to keep it moving, but I said hey second chances, let me give him a try, the customer service gave me a $35 credit so I said why not, second tasker was second and highest rating with good reviews. People if I show you the pictures of the mess that was left in my house little girl was not even worth the money she’s charging.\n\nI’ve put in two calls today to Taskrabbit responded to their email with the photos to make very clear I will not be paying anyone any money. \n\nThe only good thing out of this process was the customer service reps, attempting and trying to help other than that I will not be using this app again",

You have as much visibility to leadership as you want including personal one to one’s up to the CEO. \nThe work is hard, you will always be busy, you will be challenged, but that’s why they call it work. You have to be a hard worker with an open mind and great bedside manor to do well here.",

(together with its Affiliates (defined below), “Taskrabbit”, “we”, “us” or “our”) governing your use of Taskrabbit’s websites (including www.taskrabbit.com, www.taskrabbit.co.uk, www.taskrabbit.ca, www.taskrabbit.fr, www.taskrabbit.de, www.taskrabbit.es, www.taskrabbit.pt, and www.taskrabbit.it) (together, the “Sites”), mobile applications (together, the “Apps”), and related services, information and communications (collectively referred to herein as the “Platform” or the “Taskrabbit Platform”).\n\nThe use of all personal data you submit to the Platform or which we collect about you is governed by our Global Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”).\n\nThese Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and the Taskrabbit Happiness Pledge (the “Happiness Pledge”) for the country in which the Task is performed (which are each incorporated by reference, and referred to collectively, herein as the “Agreement”), governs your access to and use of the Platform. The Agreement also includes all other supplemental policies and terms referenced and/or linked to within these Terms or which are otherwise made available to you, all of which also apply to your use of the Platform and are incorporated into the Agreement by reference (including, without limitation, the IKEA Pre-Paid Assembly Service Terms and Conditions for IKEA Pre-paid Assembly Tasks, as applicable ).\n\nFOR U.S. AND CANADIAN USERS, SECTION 24 CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST TASKRABBIT TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING, IF APPLICABLE, YOUR RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION.\n\nBY ACKNOWLEDGING THE TERMS OF SERVICE AND/OR ACCESSING AND USING THE PLATFORM, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY (WITHOUT LIMITATION OR QUALIFICATION), THE AGREEMENT (INCLUDING, ALL TERMS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE).\n\nIF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE AGREEMENT AND ABIDE BY ITS TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE PLATFORM.\n\n1.The Platform.\n\nA. Online Marketplace.\n\nThe Platform is an online web- and app-based two-sided marketplace which enables connections between Clients and Taskers. “Client(s)” are individuals and/or businesses seeking to obtain short-term services (“Task(s)”), and “Tasker(s)” are businesses seeking to perform Tasks for Clients. Clients and Taskers are referred to herein together as “User(s)”.\n\nTaskers are independent business owners, providing services under their own name or business name (and not under Taskrabbit’s name), using their own tools and supplies. Taskers choose the applicable rates for Tasks, without deduction by Taskrabbit. Taskers may (a) maintain a clientele without any restrictions from Taskrabbit; (b) offer and provide their services elsewhere, including through competing platforms; and (c) accept or reject Clients and Service Agreements (defined below). Taskers are independent contractors of Clients, and Clients are therefore clients of Taskers, not Taskrabbit.\n\nAny reference to a Tasker being licensed or credentialed in some manner, or being \"badged”, “reliable”, “reliability rate”, “elite”, “great value”, \"background checked\", “vetted” (or similar language) indicates only that the Tasker has completed a relevant user account registration process or met certain criteria and does not, and shall not be deemed to, represent anything else. Any such description: (i) is intended to be useful information for Clients to evaluate when they make their own decisions about the identity and suitability of Taskers whom they select or interact, or contract with via the Platform; and (ii) is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Taskrabbit of a Tasker’s skills or qualifications or whether they are licensed, insured, trustworthy, safe or suitable.\n\nNotwithstanding any feature or service of the Platform that a Client may use to expedite Tasker selection, the Client is responsible for determining the Task and selecting or otherwise approving their Tasker and should undertake their own research prior to booking any Task to be satisfied that a specific Tasker has the right qualifications.\n\nB. Taskrabbit’s Role.\n\nThe Platform is not an employment agency service or business, and Taskrabbit is not an employer of any User. Users are not employees, partners, representatives, agents, joint venturers, independent contractors or franchisees of Taskrabbit.\n\nUsers hereby acknowledge and agree that (a) Taskrabbit does not (i) perform Tasks nor employ individuals to perform Tasks, (ii) supervise, scope, direct, control or monitor Taskers’ work (including that Taskrabbit does not set Taskers’ work locations, work hours, or terms of work), nor provide tools or supplies to, or pay any expenses of, Taskers, or (iii) have any control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of Tasks or Users (or the acts or omissions thereof), nor of the integrity, responsibility, competence, qualifications, communications, or the ratings or reviews provided by Users with respect to each other; and (b) the formation of a Service Agreement will not, under any circumstances, create any responsibility or liability for Taskrabbit, nor any employment or other relationship between Taskrabbit and the Users or between the Client and the Tasker. Users do not have authority to, and may not act as agent for, nor bind or make any representations on behalf of, Taskrabbit (including that Taskers may not modify all or any part of the Taskrabbit fees (see Section 3 below).\n\nTaskrabbit is neither responsible nor liable for workers’ compensation or any tax payment or withholding, including but not limited to applicable sales taxes, HST/QST/GST/PST, unemployment or employment insurance, Canada Pension Plan, disability insurance, applicable VAT, National Insurance, employer’s liability, employer training tax, social security contributions, PAYE or other applicable payroll withholdings in connection with a User’s use of the Platform, or personal income tax. The Tasker assumes full and sole responsibility for all required and applicable income tax and social contributions such as Social Security or National Insurance Contribution withholdings as to the Tasker and all persons engaged by the Tasker in the performance of the Task Services. Each User assumes all liability for proper classification of such User’s workers based on applicable legal guidelines.\n\nC. License.\n\nSubject to your compliance with the terms of the Agreement (including, without limitation, these Terms and Taskrabbit’s Acceptable Use Policy), Taskrabbit grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable and revocable license to (a) access and use the Platform (in the locations and territories where the Platform has a presence), (b) download, access and use the App on your personal device, solely in furtherance of your use of the Platform, and (c) access and view any content, information and materials made available on the Platform, in all cases for your personal use and the intended purpose of the Platform. All Users are subject to, and agree to comply with, the Acceptable Use Policy in their use of the Platform. Users may not copy, download, use, redesign, reconfigure, reverse engineer or retransmit the Platform or anything therefrom or thereon (in whole or in part) without Taskrabbit’s prior written consent. Any rights not granted by Taskrabbit are expressly reserved.\n\nD. User Representations and Warranties.\n\nIn your access to and use of the Platform, you represent and warrant that you:\n\nwill comply fully with the terms of the Agreement, including, without limitation, these Terms and the Acceptable Use Policy and other Supplemental Terms;\n\nare at least of the legally required age in the jurisdiction in which you reside, and are otherwise capable of entering into binding contracts;\n\nhave the right, authority and capacity to enter into the Agreement (including that you have the right and authority to act on behalf of, and bind to the Agreement, any company or organization on whose behalf you are entering into the Agreement);\n\nwill only request and/or perform (as applicable) Tasks in a country where the Platform has a presence;\n\nwill respect the privacy (including, without limitation, private, family and home life), property, and data protection rights of Users and will not record (whether video or audio or otherwise) any Task or any interaction by or with any User and/or Taskrabbit without obtaining the prior written consent of Taskrabbit and/or the relevant User, as applicable;\n\nwill act professionally and responsibly in your interactions with, and fulfill the commitments you make to, other Users (including by communicating clearly and promptly through the Chat Thread, and being present and/or available at the time you agree upon with other Users);\n\nwill only utilize the third-party PSP (as defined in the Fees, Payments and Cancellation Supplemental Terms) to make or receive payment for Tasks;\n\nwill use your legal name and/or legal business name (as per your government issued identification and registration documents) and an up-to-date photo on your profile;\n\nwill comply with all applicable local, state, provincial, national, or international laws in your use of the Platform;\n\nwill not use the Platform for the purchase or delivery of alcohol, or any other controlled or illegal substances or services; and\n\nwill ensure that all communications regarding Tasks (including, without limitation, scoping and payments and any questions relevant to Tasks), remain on the Platform, before, during and after the Task.\n\nE. Additional Tasker Representations and Warranties.\n\nIf you are a Tasker, you additionally represent and warrant that, in your access to and use of the Platform, you:\n\nare operating as a sole proprietor, partnership, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, corporation or other business entity when using the Platform;\n\nare customarily engaged in an independently established business of the same nature as the services performed for Clients through the Platform, and maintain an independent clientele;\n\nhave the unrestricted right to work in the jurisdiction in which you perform Tasks;\n\nhave and will maintain (at your own expense) any licenses, permits, and/or registrations required by applicable laws that apply to your performance of Tasks (including, as applicable, a business license, business tax registration, and/or contractor’s license);\n\nhave and will maintain all insurance required to operate your business and perform the Tasks;\n\nwill respond to invitations promptly; provide timely, high-quality services for your Clients as agreed in the Chat Thread (defined below); only offer and provide Tasks for which you have the necessary expertise to perform; and perform the Tasks as agreed upon with your Client in a safe manner; and\n\nwill promptly disclose to Taskrabbit in writing if you have any potentially relevant criminal convictions (other than minor fixed penalty parking or speeding offenses) that arise during your use of the Platform.\n\n2.Use of the Platform.\n\nA. Registration.\n\nYou must register and create an account to access and use the Platform, providing only correct and accurate information (such as, without limitation, your name, business name, mailing address, email address, and/or telephone number). You agree to immediately notify Taskrabbit (at help.tr.co) of any changes to your account information. If any such change relates to ownership of your telephone numbers, you may notify Taskrabbit by texting STOP to any text message sent to the retiring phone number. Failure to provide and maintain updated and accurate information may result in your inability to use the Platform and/or Taskrabbit’s termination of this Agreement with you. Taskrabbit may restrict anyone from completing registration if Taskrabbit determines such person may threaten the safety and integrity of the Platform, or if such restriction is necessary to address any other reasonable business concern.\n\nB. Account Security.\n\nYou are fully and solely responsible for (a) maintaining the confidentiality of any log-in, password, and account number provided by or given to you to access the Platform; and (b) all activities that occur under your password or account, even if not authorized by you. Taskrabbit has no control over any User’s account. You agree to notify Taskrabbit immediately if you suspect any unauthorized party may be using your Platform password or account or any other breach of security.\n\nC. Tasker Onboarding\n\n(i) Background Checks. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Taskers may be subject to a review process before they can register on, and during their use of, the Platform, which may include, but is not limited to, identity verification and criminal background checks, using third party services as appropriate (“Background Check(s)”). If a Tasker, to the extent permitted under applicable law, you agree to undergo such Background Checks. Taskrabbit cannot, and does not, assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or reliability of Background Check information, nor for any false or misleading statements made by Users of the Platform.\n\n(ii) Professional Licensing. Taskrabbit does not independently verify that Taskers have the necessary expertise, or have obtained any licenses, permits, or registrations required, to perform their Tasks. It may be unlawful to perform certain types of Tasks without a license, permit and/or registration, and performing same may result in law enforcement action and/or penalties or fines. Taskers are solely responsible for avoiding such prohibited Tasks. If you have questions about how national, state, provincial, territorial and/or local laws apply to your Tasks on the Platform, you should first seek appropriate legal guidance. Clients are solely responsible for determining if a Tasker has the skills and qualifications necessary to perform the specific Task and confirming that the Tasker has obtained all required licenses, permits, or registrations, if any. Clients may wish to consult their national, state, provincial, territorial and/or local law requirements to determine whether certain Tasks are required to be performed by a licensed or otherwise registered professional.\n\nD. Service Agreement.\n\nThe Platform allows Users to offer, search for and book Tasks. After identifying and selecting a Tasker to perform a Task, the Client and the Tasker may communicate via the chat thread in the Platform (the “Chat Thread”) to understand the scope, schedule and other details of the Task (including, without limitation, any specific hazards, obstacles, or impediments in the Task location (whether visible or concealed) that may impact the performance of the Task). Once the Task is scheduled via the Platform by the Tasker, the Client and Tasker form a legally binding contract for the Task, which includes the engagement terms proposed and accepted, and any other contractual terms agreed to, by the Client and the Tasker in the Chat Thread for the Task (the “Service Agreement”). The Client and the Tasker each agree to comply with the Service Agreement and the Agreement during the engagement, performance and completion of a Task. Taskers are responsible for exercising their own business judgment in entering into Service Agreements and performing Tasks; and acknowledge that there is a chance for individual profit or loss. Taskrabbit is not a party to any Service Agreement. The formation of a Service Agreement will not, under any circumstances, create any responsibility or liability for Taskrabbit.\n\nE. Other Parties\n\n(i) Tasker Assistants. Where approved in advance by the Client in the Chat Thread for the Task, Taskers may engage assistants, helpers, subcontractors or other personnel (“Tasker Assistant(s)”) to perform all or any part of a Task; provided that such Tasker Assistants have registered through the Platform and meet all of the requirements applicable to the Tasker as set out in the Agreement. The Tasker assumes full and sole responsibility for the acts and omissions of all Tasker Assistants used in its performance of Tasks and is fully responsible for: (a) the lawful payment of all compensation, benefits and expenses for its Tasker Assistants, (b) all required and applicable tax withholdings as to such Tasker Assistants, and (c) ensuring all Tasker Assistants are registered Taskers on the Platform.\n\n(ii) Client Agents. The Client agrees that if they have authorized someone other than the Client to book a Task on their behalf or to be present in their stead when the Task is performed, the Client is appointing that person as their agent (“Client Agent(s)”), and the Client is deemed to have granted to the Client Agent the authority to act as their agent in relation to the applicable Task. Client Agents may direct or instruct the Tasker’s performance of the Task, and the Tasker may follow such direction as if the direction was given by the Client. The Client assumes full and sole responsibility for the acts and omissions of Client Agents.\n\nF. IKEA Pre-paid Assembly Services.\n\nTo the extent you’ve purchased IKEA Pre-paid Assembly Services, through IKEA in-store or online, the IKEA Pre-paid Assembly Terms and Conditions will apply to these services, in addition to the terms elsewhere in the Agreement.\n\n3.Fees, Billing, Invoicing, and Payment; Cancellation.\n\nThe terms relevant to fees (including Tasker Payments and Taskrabbit’s fees), invoicing, payment (including for Tasks, and any other amounts owed by Users hereunder) and cancellation, are set out the Fees, Payments and Cancellation Supplemental Terms, which applies to your access to and use of the Platform. Unless otherwise expressly stated in this Agreement, all fees (including, without limitation, the Task Payment and all Taskrabbit fees) are non-refundable.\n\n4.Contests and Promotional Codes.\n\nTaskrabbit may, from time to time, provide certain optional promotional codes, opportunities and contests to Users. All such optional promotional opportunities will be run at the sole discretion of Taskrabbit, will be subject to the terms and conditions governing same, and can be implemented, modified, or removed at any time by Taskrabbit without advance notification. The liability of Taskrabbit and Affiliates relevant to such promotional opportunities and contests, shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 13 of these Terms.\n\n5.Public Areas.\n\nThe Platform may contain profiles, email systems, blogs, message boards, reviews, ratings, task postings, chat areas, news groups, forums, communities and/or other message or communication facilities (“Public Areas”) that allow Users to communicate with other Users. You may only use such community areas to send and receive messages and materials that are relevant and proper to the applicable forum.\n\nYou understand that all submissions made to Public Areas will be public, and you will be publicly identified by your name or login identification when communicating in Public Areas. Taskrabbit will not be responsible for the actions of any Users with respect to any information or materials posted or disclosed in Public Areas.\n\n6.Deactivation and Suspension.\n\nIn the event of an actual or suspected breach by you of any part of the Agreement (including, without limitation, abuse, fraud or interference with the proper working of the Platform), Taskrabbit may (a) suspend your right to use the Platform pending its investigation; and/or (b) deactivate your account or limit your use of the Platform upon its confirmation of a breach. Taskrabbit will provide you with written notice of its determination in accordance with, and as required by, applicable laws. If you wish to appeal any determination made by Taskrabbit pursuant to this Section, please contact us here within 14 days of receipt of such notice with the grounds for your appeal.\n\nIf Taskrabbit suspends or deactivates your account or limits your use of the Platform pursuant to this Section 6, you may not register and/or create a new account under different usernames, identities or contact details (whether under your or any other name or business name), even if you are acting on behalf of a third party.\n\n7.Termination.\n\nYou may terminate the Agreement between you and Taskrabbit at any time by ceasing all use of the Platform and deactivating your account. Taskrabbit may terminate the Agreement between you and Taskrabbit at any time, and cease providing access to the Platform (pursuant to Section 6 above), if you breach any part of the Agreement or violate applicable laws.\n\nEven after your right to use the Platform is suspended, terminated or limited, the Agreement will remain enforceable against you. Taskrabbit reserves the right to take appropriate legal action pursuant to the Agreement.\n\n8.User Generated Content; Feedback.\n\nA. User Generated Content.\n\n“User Generated Content” is defined as any information, content and materials (including any videotape, film, recording, photograph, voice) you provide to Taskrabbit, its agents, Affiliates, and corporate partners, or other Users in connection with your registration for and use of the Platform (including, without limitation, the information and materials posted or transmitted for use in Public Areas).\n\nUser Generated Content is not the opinion of, and has not been verified or approved by, Taskrabbit.

Feedback\n\nThe Platform hosts User Generated Content relating to reviews and ratings of specific Taskers (“Feedback”), which enables Users to post and read other Users’ expressions of their experiences.

Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice. Your address for such notices is the one associated with your account, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to Taskrabbit. Taskrabbit’s address for such notice is as set out here.\n\n16.App Store-Sourced Apps.\n\nIf you access or download any App from the Apple App Store, you agree to Apple’s Licensed Application End User License Agreement and will comply therewith in your access to and use of the App(s). If you access or download any App from the Google Play Store, you agree to Google Play Terms of Service and will comply therewith in your access to and use of the App(s).\n\n17.Changes to the Agreement, the Platform and the App.\n\nA. Changes to the Agreement.\n\nTaskrabbit reserves the right, for justifiable and proportionate reasons, at any time, to review, change, modify, update, add to, supplement, suspend, discontinue, or delete any term(s) or provision(s) of the Agreement (including the Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Acceptable Use Policy and/or Happiness Pledge).\n\nNotice of such amendments may be given by posting such updates or modifications (or notice thereof) on the Platform, on the online location of the relevant terms, policies or supplemental terms, by e-mail or in any other reasonable manner; and the amendments will be effective upon such posting. Your continued use of the Platform after such posting constitutes your consent to be bound by the Agreement, as amended.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if such modifications and/or updates are material, you will be informed in advance (in the manner set out in this Section) for your acceptance or rejection. If any changes to the Agreement are unacceptable to you or cause you to no longer be in compliance with the Agreement, the previous Terms will apply to your current Tasks, but you will not be able to use the Platform or contract new Tasks and you must deactivate your account, and immediately stop using the Platform. After notifying you of any material changes, your continued use of the Platform following any revision to the Agreement constitutes your complete and irrevocable acceptance of any and all such changes, except where prohibited by any laws or regulations in your jurisdiction.\n\nTo the extent permitted by law, Taskrabbit shall not be liable to you for any modification to all or any portion of the Agreement.\n\nB. Changes to the Platform.\n\nTaskrabbit reserves the right to, at any time, review, improve, modify, update, upgrade, discontinue, impose limits, or restrict access to, whether temporarily or permanently, all or any portion of the Platform (including any content or information available on or through the Platform), effective with prior notice (where possible) and without any liability to Taskrabbit. To the extent permitted by law, Taskrabbit shall not be liable to you for any updates, upgrades, modifications to or discontinuance of all or any portion of the Platform.\n\nC.

You can uninstall the App(s) at any time.\n\n18.No Rights of Third Parties.\n\nExcept as expressly set out herein and/or is otherwise required by applicable laws, the Agreement is for the sole benefit of Taskrabbit and the User, and their permitted successors and assigns, and there are no other third-party beneficiaries under the Agreement. None of the terms of the Agreement are enforceable by any persons who are not a party to the Agreement; provided, however, that Taskrabbit may enforce any such provisions on behalf of its Affiliates. In the United Kingdom, no terms are enforceable under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 by a person who is not a party to the Agreement, provided, however, that a Client’s Agent may act in the name of and on behalf of their Client.\n\n19.Notices and Consent to Receive Notices Electronically.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the Agreement, all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications (collectively, “Notices”) under the Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or email; or the day it is shown as delivered by the overnight delivery service’s tracking information, if sent for next day delivery by a recognized overnight delivery service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Notices to which the Agreement refers will be sent to you electronically (including, without limitation, by email or by posting Notices on the Sites), and you consent to receive Notices in this manner. All notices that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.\n\nIf you have any questions about these Terms of Service or about the Platform, please contact us here.\n\n20.Consent to Electronic Signatures.\n\nBy using the Platform, you agree (a) to transact electronically through the Platform; (b) your electronic signature is the legal equivalent of your manual signature and has the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a paper-based signature; (c) your use of a keypad, mouse or other device to select an item, button, icon or similar act/action, constitutes your signature as if actually signed by you in writing; and (d) no certification authority or other third party verification is necessary to validate your electronic signature, and the lack of such certification or third party verification will not in any way affect the enforceability of your electronic signature.\n\n21. Governing Law.\n\nExcept for Sections 15 (Dispute Resolution) and/or 24 (Jurisdiction-specific Provisions) hereof, the Agreement and your use of the Platform will be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws as set out in this Section (without regard to choice of law principles):\n\nFor Users within the United States: The laws of the State of California.\n\nFor Users outside of the United States: English law, and any dispute regarding the Agreement or the use of the Platform will only be dealt with by the English courts.\n\nThe choices of law set out in this Section shall apply unless and to the extent federal, state, provincial, local and international laws, rules, regulations, directives, judgments and/or orders binding on or applicable to you or your performance hereunder, require that the Agreement or your use of the Platform be governed by the laws of the country in which the Task is performed. This provision is intended only to designate the governing laws to interpret the Agreement and is not intended to create any substantive right to non-residents of the designated country/province/state to assert claims under such law whether by statute, common law, or otherwise. Nothing shall prevent Taskrabbit from bringing proceedings to protect our intellectual property rights before any competent court.\n\n22.Notices.\n\nThe Taskrabbit Platform, websites and Apps are owned and operated by Taskrabbit, Inc., a company registered in Delaware (United States). Our registration number is 4599240 and our tax identification number in Europe is EU528004784. If you have any questions about the Agreement or the Platform, please contact us by using the means listed here.\n\n23.General Provisions.\n\na. Relationship of the Parties.\n\nNo agency, partnership, joint venture, employer-employee or franchiser-franchisee relationship exists, is intended or created between you and Taskrabbit by the Agreement or your use of the Platform. Users do not have authority to act as agent for, nor to bind or make any representations on behalf of, Taskrabbit.\n\nb. Entire Agreement.\n\nThe Agreement (including any terms linked to in, and incorporated by reference into, these Terms) constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between you and Taskrabbit with respect to your use of the Platform, and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements, proposals or communications, except as otherwise specified in the Arbitration Agreement in Section 24(A). However, the Agreement does not supersede other agreements about other subject matter that you may have with Taskrabbit, such as the IKEA Pre-paid Assembly Service Terms and Conditions. The provisions of the Agreement are intended to be interpreted in a manner which makes them valid, legal, and enforceable.\n\nc. Severability; Waiver.\n\nExcept for the “Agreement Prohibiting Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” provision in Section 24(A) below, in the event any provision is found to be partially or wholly invalid, illegal or unenforceable, (1) such provision shall be modified or restructured to the extent and in the manner necessary to render it valid, legal, and enforceable, or (2) if such provision cannot be so modified or restructured, it shall be excised from the Agreement without affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of any of the remaining provisions. Failure by Taskrabbit to enforce any provision(s) of the Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right.\n\nYou hereby acknowledge and agree that we may assign or transfer the Agreement without your consent. In any case, this assignment will be notified to the User who, in the event legally foreseen, may terminate the Agreement and cease use of the Platform. Upon the effective date of the assignment of the Agreement (a) Taskrabbit shall be relieved of all rights, obligations and/or liabilities to you arising in respect of events postdating the effective date of the assignment, and (b) the assignee entity shall replace Taskrabbit for the performance of the Agreement. You may not assign or transfer the Agreement without our prior written approval. Any assignment in violation of this Section 23 shall be null and void. The Agreement will inure to the benefit of Taskrabbit, its successors and assigns. All parts of the Agreement which, by their nature, should survive the expiration or termination of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to, and notwithstanding, the expiration or termination of the Agreement or your use of the Platform.\n\nThe Agreement, in whole and in part, is drawn up in English. In case of discrepancies between the English text version of the Agreement (in whole or in part) and any translation of the Agreement, the English version shall prevail.\n\n24.Jurisdiction-specific Provisions, including Dispute Resolution.\n\nThe terms in this Section apply to Users in the noted jurisdictions. To the extent that there are any discrepancies or inconsistencies between these Global Terms of Service and the following jurisdiction-specific provisions, the jurisdiction-specific provisions shall prevail, govern and control with respect to Users in those jurisdictions.\n\nA.Residents of the United States of America.\n\nI.Dispute Resolution - Arbitration Agreement.\n\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY — IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND GOVERNS HOW YOU AND TASKRABBIT CAN BRING CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THIS SECTION WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU AND TASKRABBIT TO SUBMIT CLAIMS TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.\n\nBY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE, WITHOUT LIMITATION OR QUALIFICATION, TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT AND YOU ACCEPT ALL OF ITS TERMS.\n\n(a)Agreement to Binding Arbitration\n\nIN EXCHANGE FOR THE BENEFITS OF THE SPEEDY, ECONOMICAL, AND IMPARTIAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE OF ARBITRATION, YOU AND TASKRABBIT MUTUALLY AGREE TO WAIVE YOUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RESOLUTION OF ALL DISPUTES OR CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN A COURT OF LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES BY BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AS SET FORTH HEREIN.\n\nThis agreement to arbitrate (“Arbitration Agreement”) is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and survives the termination of the Agreement and your relationship with Taskrabbit.\n\nTo the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and Taskrabbit agree to arbitrate any and all disputes and claims (the “Claim(s)”) relating to, arising from or regarding your use of the Platform, your relationship with Taskrabbit, Tasks, or the Agreement (including previous versions), including Claims by Taskrabbit, Claims against Taskrabbit and Claims against Taskrabbit’s Affiliates (including its parent company).\n\nTo the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, this includes, but is not limited to, claims related to payments, any city, county, state or federal wage and hour law, compensation, meal or rest breaks, expense reimbursement, wrongful termination, discrimination, harassment, retaliation, fraud, defamation, trade secrets, unfair competition, personal injury, property damage or loss, emotional distress, any promotions or offers made by Taskrabbit, or the threatened or actual suspension or deactivation of your account; breach of any express or implied contract or breach of any express or implied covenant; claims arising under federal or state consumer protection laws; claims arising under antitrust laws; claims arising under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act; claims arising under the Fair Labor Standards Act, Civil Rights Act, Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Americans With Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (except for individual claims for employee benefits under any benefit plan sponsored by Taskrabbit and covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or funded by insurance), and state or local statutes, if any, addressing the same or similar subject matters; and all other federal, state or local statutory and common law claims.\n\nIf there is a dispute about the arbitrability of any claim (including about the formation, scope, applicability, interpretation, validity, and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement), you and Taskrabbit agree that this threshold dispute shall be resolved by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below. To the extent that any third-party beneficiary to this Agreement brings claims against a party, those claims shall also be subject to this Arbitration Agreement. If either party brings both arbitrable and non-arbitrable claims in the same action or related actions, both agree that the non-arbitrable claims shall be stayed until the conclusion of the arbitration, to the fullest extent permitted by law.\n\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND TASKRABBIT ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS, UNLESS EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO REQUIRE ARBITRATION OF EVERY CLAIM OR DISPUTE THAT CAN LAWFULLY BE ARBITRATED, EXCEPT THOSE CLAIMS AND DISPUTES THAT, BY THE TERMS OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, ARE EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED FROM THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE.\n\n(b)Prohibition of Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\n\nExcept as otherwise required under applicable law, you and Taskrabbit agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Claim between Taskrabbit (and/or, if applicable, its Affiliates) and you individually. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND TASKRABBIT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, OR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (“Class Action Waiver”). Further, unless both you and Taskrabbit otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Class Action Waiver shall not apply to California Private Attorney General Act Claims, which are addressed separately below.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which: (i) the Claim is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (ii) there is a final judicial determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable as to any Claims, then those Claims shall be severed from any remaining Claims and may remain in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other Claims to the fullest extent possible.\n\n(c)Representative PAGA Waiver\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, to the fullest extent allowed by law: (1) you and Taskrabbit agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the California Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”), California Labor Code § 2698 et seq., in any court or in arbitration, and (2) for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under PAGA, both you and Taskrabbit agree that any such Claim shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law) (collectively, “Representative PAGA Waiver”).\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of this representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall be severed from the Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration Agreement or the requirement that any remaining Claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (iii) any such representative PAGA or other representative private attorneys general act Claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Claims to be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims, the parties agree that court litigation of those Claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.\n\n(d)Rules and Logistics Governing Arbitration\n\nIn order to initiate arbitration, a claim must be filed with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and the written Demand for Arbitration (available at www.adr.org) must be provided to the other party. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the AAA Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated and modified by the terms set forth in the Agreement, and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if requested by you and if proper based on the facts and circumstances of the Claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select a different set of AAA Rules. You and Taskrabbit agree that the arbitration shall be administered before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, and if the parties cannot agree within 30 days after names of potential arbitrators have been proposed, then by a single arbitrator who is chosen by the AAA.\n\nAs part of the arbitration, the parties will have the opportunity for reasonable discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim(s). The arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be available in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual Claims. The arbitrator will provide a reasoned written statement of the arbitrator’s decision, which shall explain the award given and the findings and conclusions on which the decision is based.\n\nThe arbitrator will decide the substance of all Claims in accordance with applicable law and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. Claims will be governed by their applicable statute of limitations and failure to demand arbitration within the prescribed time period shall bar the Claims as provided by law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\n\nYour arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules) subject to the following modifications:\n\n(i) If Taskrabbit initiates arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, Taskrabbit will pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees.\n\n(ii) If a Client or Tasker files a Claim in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement and the associated claim for damages does not exceed USD $10,000, Taskrabbit will pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\n\n(iii) If a Client or Tasker files a Claim in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement and the associated claim for damages exceeds USD $10,000, Taskrabbit shall pay all costs unique to arbitration (as compared to the costs of adjudicating the same claims before a court), including the regular and customary arbitration fees and expenses, and the Client or Tasker shall be responsible for contributing up to an amount equal to the filing fee that would be paid to initiate the claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which the Task was performed, unless a lower fee amount would be owed by you as required by law or the applicable AAA Rules. Any dispute as to whether a cost is unique to arbitration shall be resolved by the arbitrator. If the arbitrator finds that the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), however, then the allocation of fees will be governed by the applicable AAA Rules.\n\n(iv) Except as required by law or the applicable AAA Rules, each party shall pay its own attorneys’ fees and pay any costs that are not unique to the arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would incur if the Claim(s) were litigated in a court, such as costs to subpoena witnesses and/or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.).\n\n(v) At the conclusion of any arbitration, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees and costs or any portion thereof to the prevailing party, to the extent authorized by applicable law or the applicable AAA Rules.\n\nUnless you and Taskrabbit agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings with a Tasker will take place remotely or in the county of the Tasker’s billing address, and any arbitration hearings with a Client will take place remotely or in the county in which the Client received Task services. If AAA arbitration is unavailable in your county and the parties wish to proceed with an in-person hearing, the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available location for a AAA arbitration.\n\n(e)Exceptions to Arbitration\n\nThe Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of claims:\n\nClaims for workers’ compensation, disability insurance and unemployment insurance benefits;\n\nSmall claims actions that are within the scope of small claims court jurisdiction and brought on an individual basis;\n\nApplications for provisional remedies, preliminary injunctions, and temporary restraining orders relating to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights;\n\nRepresentative action brought on behalf of others under PAGA or other private attorney general acts, to the extent the representative PAGA Waiver in Section 24(A)(I)(c) is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction under applicable law not preempted by the FAA; and\n\nClaims that have been expressly excluded from mandatory arbitration by the Federal Arbitration Act or a governing law not preempted by the FAA.\n\nNothing in this Arbitration Agreement prevents you from making a report to or filing a claim or charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Labor, Securities Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board, or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, or a similar local, state or federal agency, and nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill the party’s obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration. The Agreement and Arbitration Agreement do not prevent you from participating in an investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by this Arbitration Agreement and do not prevent you from receiving an award for information provided to any government agencies.\n\n(f)Severability\n\nIn addition to the severability provisions in subsections (b) and (c), in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable under applicable law not preempted by the FAA, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.\n\n(g)Opt Out of Arbitration Agreement\n\nFor Taskers, you may opt out of the requirement to arbitrate if you have not previously agreed to an arbitration provision in Taskrabbit’s Terms of Service where you had the opportunity to opt out of the requirement to arbitrate. If you have previously agreed to such an arbitration provision, you may opt out of any revisions to your prior arbitration agreement made by this version of the arbitration agreement in the manner specified below, but opting out of this arbitration agreement has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with Taskrabbit.\n\nExcept as specified in this arbitration agreement, if you are a Tasker, you may opt out of the Arbitration Agreement by notifying Taskrabbit in writing within 30 days of your agreement to these Terms of Service. To opt out, you must send a signed written notification to Taskrabbit, Inc., at its United States mailing address listed on its Contact Details page, available at [https://support.taskrabbit.com/hc/articles/22213175564813]. The notification must include: (i) your account username, (ii) your name, (iii) your address, (iv) your telephone number, (v) your email address, and (vi) a clear statement indicating that you wish to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement.\n\n(h)Tasker Claims in Pending Class Action\n\nIf you are a member of a putative class in a wage and hour class action lawsuit against Taskrabbit that is pending as of the effective date of these Terms of Service (a “Pending Class Action”), then this Arbitration Agreement shall not apply to your claims in that particular class action. Instead, your claims in that Pending Class Action shall continue to be governed by the arbitration provisions contained in the applicable Agreement that you accepted prior to the Agreement’s effective date.\n\nII.Telephone Communications and Agreement to be Contacted.\n\nYou acknowledge that by providing your telephone number, you expressly consent and agree to receive calls or text messages, including by manual dialing and/or using an automated telephone dialing system, from Taskrabbit and Affiliates, or from independent contractors (including Taskers) related to your account, registration, onboarding, upcoming or scheduled Tasks, changes and updates, service outages, follow ups to any push notifications delivered through our mobile application, any transaction with Taskrabbit, and/or your relationship with Taskrabbit, even if your telephone number is registered on any state or federal Do Not Call list.

THIS SECTION WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, REQUIRE YOU AND TASKRABBIT TO SUBMIT CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.\n\nBY ENTERING INTO THE AGREEMENT, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE, WITHOUT LIMITATION OR QUALIFICATION, TO BE BOUND BY THE AGREEMENT AND YOU ACCEPT ALL OF ITS TERMS.\n\nAgreement to Binding Arbitration.\n\nExcept where prohibited by law (which may include the Province of Quebec), any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of, relating to, or in respect of these Terms, including their negotiation, validity, existence, breach, termination, construction or application, or the rights, duties or obligations of any party, or the rights, duties or obligations of any party derived from or associated with these Terms (a “Dispute”), shall be referred to and determined by a single arbitrator in a final and binding arbitration administered under the rules of ADR Institute of Canada, Inc.’s Arbitration Rules, a current copy of which are available here (the “ADR Rules”). In accepting these Terms of Service, you acknowledge receipt of and a reasonable opportunity to review the ADR Rules. The parties agree and acknowledge that under the ADR Rules, there is a fee associated with submitting a Dispute; applicable filing fees will be as set out in the ADR Rules.\n\nThe arbitration will be determined by a single arbitrator, to be appointed in accordance with the ADR Rules. For greater certainty, neither Taskers nor Clients shall commence or participate in a class proceeding or other group or similar action in respect of any Dispute, except and to the extent that provincial consumer protection legislation expressly preserves such an entitlement in the context of the particular Dispute.\n\nThe seat of the arbitration shall be the province in which the Tasker performs the majority of the Task services and the applicable arbitration legislation in the seat shall apply to the Dispute. The arbitration shall be heard in the capital of the seat, unless the parties agree otherwise. A party to the arbitration has no right of appeal from any award of the Arbitrator, whether characterized as final, interim, interlocutory or partial.\n\nAll Disputes referred to arbitration (including the scope of the agreement to arbitrate, the law relating to the enforcement of the agreement to arbitrate, any relevant limitation periods, the law governing the procedure of the arbitration, the law relating to available remedies, set-off claims and conflict of laws rules) shall be governed by the law of the seat. Each party hereby irrevocably consents to venue in the capital of the seat, and to the jurisdiction of competent courts in the capital of the seat for all litigation that may be brought; however it is agreed and acknowledged that the intention of the parties is to arbitrate the Dispute without recourse to the courts. The arbitration be conducted in English, except in Quebec, where the arbitration shall be conducted in either English or French at the election of the Tasker.\n\nA party to the Agreement may take such steps as are permitted or required to enforce an award made by an Arbitrator. Except as required by law, and only to the extent that such disclosure is reasonably necessary, or for the purposes of obtaining professional advice, the existence of the arbitration and any element of the arbitration, including any award, shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed to any non-party to the arbitration. No document or other evidence or information prepared for or produced by or on behalf of any party to the arbitration shall be disclosed to any non-party to the arbitration.\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, nothing in this Section prevents a Tasker from making a report to or filing a claim, application or charge with the applicable governmental or administrative agency or tribunal, including, as applicable, the applicable Ministry of Labour, human rights commission or tribunal, and labour relations board, (cumulatively, “administrative agencies”) if the terms of applicable legislation entitles you to do so and precludes exclusive pre-dispute recourse to arbitration. For the avoidance of any doubt, administrative agencies do not include provincial or federal courts.\n\nD.Residents of Germany.\n\nUsers in Germany are free to file a claim related to the Agreement in a German court at any time and do not have to notify Taskrabbit of any disputes prior to filing such claims.\n\nE. Residents of Monaco.\n\nUsers who are residents of Monaco are considered as “consumers” – meaning any individual who, when entering into a distance contract, does not act in the course of his commercial, industrial, self-employed or home-made activity – shall benefit a right of withdrawal of 7 days from the day of confirmation of acceptance of the service (“Withdrawal Period”). Such right shall be exercised in writing and shall be notified by email.\n\n25.Acknowledgement and Consent.",

To help Taskers set up a payment account and help Clients make payments to Taskers and pay fees to Taskrabbit, we may collect financial information, including credit card number, bank routing numbers, tax information, taxpayer identification number, and other payment information, as applicable. We use Financial Information to operate the Taskrabbit Platform and to ensure that Taskers are paid by Clients.

Certain offerings of the Taskrabbit Platform, such as newsletters, surveys, contests, and the like are optional and so you are not required to enter them or to give us your data in connection with them. Where you do consent to take advantage of Taskrabbit Platform offerings, we will use your data to (as applicable) send you newsletters and other communications that are tailored based on information we have about you, or to operate and manage the survey, contest or similar offering in connection with our legitimate interest in promoting our business and the Taskrabbit Platform.

We do this as necessary for our legitimate interests in providing an engaging and relevant experience, promoting our services, and growing our business.\n\nCell Phone Numbers. Taskrabbit may use your cell phone number to call or send recurring text messages to you, using an autodialer or prerecorded voice, in order to provide you notifications about Tasks, for marketing purposes (with your consent where required by law), and to administer the Taskrabbit Platform.

This exchange of information is essential to the operation of the Taskrabbit Platform.\n\nLegal Obligations. Taskrabbit and our Third Party Agents may disclose your Personal Information or User Generated Content to courts, law enforcement, governmental or public authorities, tax authorities or authorised third parties, if and to the extent required or permitted to do so by law or where disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with Taskrabbit’s legal or regulatory obligations; (ii) respond to a court order, warrant or subpoena; (iii) respond to a valid legal request relating to an investigation into alleged criminal or illegal activity; or (iv) respond to or address any other activity that may expose us to legal or regulatory liability.\n\ninformation about Users’ permits, licences, tax, or social security registrations, Taskrabbit and our Third Party Agents may disclose information, including but not limited to, User contact details, identification information, transaction dates and amounts, license and permit status, and tax identification number(s) to applicable governmental authorities.\n\nTaskrabbit reserves the right to disclose Personal Information from both private and public areas of the Taskrabbit Platform in the absence of a court order, warrant, or subpoena, to the extent permitted by applicable law, if we are given reason to believe, in our sole discretion, that someone is causing injury to or interfering with the rights of Users, the general public, or Taskrabbit or its partners, parents or affiliates.\n\nIt is our policy to provide notice to Users before producing their information in response to law enforcement requests unless (i) we are prohibited or otherwise constrained by law or court order from doing so, (ii) we have reason to believe the User’s account has been compromised such that the notice would go to the wrong person, or notice would otherwise be counterproductive or would create a risk to safety, or (iii) it is an emergency request and prior notice would be impractical (in which case we may provide notice after the fact).\n\nMerger or Acquisition. Taskrabbit reserves the right to share information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale, or any other type of acquisition or business combination of all or any portion of our assets, or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another business.\n\nPublic Areas.

There, you can view, update, and correct your Account information.\n\nSo that we may protect the integrity of the Taskrabbit Platform, there are certain pieces of information, such as your age, that you cannot alter yourself. For example, since children under the age of majority in their jurisdiction of residence are not allowed to register as Users, we need to take reasonable measures to preserve the accuracy of our Users' ages. You may contact us at privacy@Taskrabbit.com if there is a need to make a correction to such data. Please see Section 11, Children’s Privacy, for more details.\n\nPromotional Communications. You can opt out of receiving promotional communications from Taskrabbit via the Account tab in your Profile. In addition, you can opt out of email marketing by clicking on the unsubscribe link in any message.

Please note that your opt-out is limited to the phone number used and will not affect subsequent subscriptions. If you opt-out of only certain communications, other subscription communications may continue. Even if you opt-out of receiving promotional communications, Taskrabbit will continue to send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, Tasks, transactions, servicing, or Taskrabbit’s ongoing business relationship with you. If you receive unsolicited promotional communications from a Taskrabbit domain, please let us know here.\n\nIf you are a California Resident, please see the Additional Disclosures for California Residents section below.\n\n8. Taskrabbit's Information Retention Policy\n\nWe retain personal data for as long as you are a User in order to meet our contractual obligations to you, and for such longer period as may be in our legitimate interests and to comply with our legal obligations (see Exhibit A for exemplar document retention periods). We may also retain data from which you cannot directly be identified, for example where stored against a randomly-generated identifier so we know the data relates to a single User, but we cannot tell who that User is. We use this kind of data for research purposes and to help us develop and improve our services, and we take appropriate measures to ensure you cannot be re-identified from this data.\n\n9. Taskrabbit’s Security of Collected Information\n\nYour Taskrabbit account is password-protected so that only you and authorized Taskrabbit staff have access to your account information. In order to maintain this protection, do not give your password to anyone. Also, if you share a computer, you should sign out of your Taskrabbit account and close the browser window before someone else logs on. This will help protect your information entered on public terminals from disclosure to third parties.\n\nTaskrabbit implements and maintains reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security safeguards to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Taskrabbit has staff dedicated to maintaining this Privacy Policy and other privacy initiatives, periodically reviewing security, and making sure that every Taskrabbit employee is aware of our security practices. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of information about you.\n\n10. Notification of Changes\n\nTaskrabbit's Privacy Policy is periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. This Privacy Policy might change as Taskrabbit updates and expands the Taskrabbit Platform. Taskrabbit will endeavor to notify you of any material changes by email. Taskrabbit also encourages you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.\n\n11. Children’s Privacy\n\nThis service is intended for a general audience, and is not directed at children under 13 years of age. In certain jurisdictions, this minimum age may be higher. Please check the Jurisdiction-specific Provisions below for more information.\n\nWe do not knowingly gather personal information (as defined by the U.S. Children’s Privacy Protection Act, or “COPPA”) in a manner not permitted by COPPA. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that we have collected information from your child in a manner not permitted by law, please let us know by contacting us here. We will remove the data.\n\nWe do not knowingly collect or “sell” the Personal Information of minors under 18 years old who are California residents.\n\n12. Contacting Us\n\nIf you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the manner in which we or our Third-Party Agents treat your Personal Information, the practices of the Site, your dealings with the Taskrabbit Platform, or if you have technical problems, you may contact us here.\n\nTaskrabbit's staff will respond to all mail or email from Users with questions about privacy, including the types of Personal Information stored on the Taskrabbit databases, and requests to know, delete or rectify such Personal Information.\n\n13. Jurisdiction-specific Provisions\n\nA. Residents of the United States of America\n\nInformation of U.S. Users. Our collection, use, and retention of the Personal Information of U.S. Users is in accordance with applicable U.S. laws, as is our determination of what is deemed to be “personal data and/or information.”\n\nTaskrabbit expressly disclaims any liability that may arise should any other individuals obtain the information you submit to the Taskrabbit Platform.\n\nInterest-Based Advertising in the United States.

If you have any further questions on this issue, please refer to the Terms of Service.\n\nAdditional Disclosures for California Residents\n\nThese additional disclosures for California residents apply only to individuals who reside in California. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) provides additional rights to know, delete and opt out, and requires business collecting or disclosing Personal Information to provide notice of rights California residents have and can exercise.\n\nCalifornia Notice of Collection.

      "# [Taskrabbit CEO Talks About The Evolution Of Gig Economy Companies by Megan Poinski on 2024-04-07](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/04/07/taskrabbit-ceo-talks-about-the-evolution-of-gig-economy-companies/)\nThis is the published version of Forbes’ CEO newsletter, which offers the latest news for today's and tomorrow's business leaders and decision makers. Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every Sunday.\n\nDisney’s current leadership made some magic happen last week, though not the kind usually linked to the company. At its annual shareholders meeting, Disney was able to ward off pushes to elect new board members from two activist investor groups—Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management and Blackwells Capital—and maintain its existing slate of 12 board members.\n\nThe hedge funds each put forward slates of nominees who pledged to take Disney down a new path. Trian was looking for Disney to address recent declines in its earnings, while Blackwells was interested in breaking the mega-company into three smaller entities: sports, entertainment and experiences. And while these both represent valid paths forward for Disney, many observers predicted the rebuffing the activist investors received. After all, Disney’s share price rebounded more than 45% during the last six months following the reinstatement of CEO Bob Iger, delivering strong quarterly results and a cost-cutting plan. An optimistic analyst note from UBS last week also projected the company’s streaming services will break even this year and be a significant source of future revenue.\n\nAlthough Disney won this round, activist investors and proxy wars aren’t going away. Trian had mounted a similar campaign against Disney’s leadership last year, with Peltz throwing in the towel after saying Disney had done what the firm wanted, and placing faith in Iger’s then-recent return to the CEO position. From Disney’s perspective, the company was fortunate this time because Iger’s business moves were beginning to bear fruit in the run-up to the shareholder meeting, as well as the opportune timing of the optimistic analyst’s note.\n\nHowever, it can be argued that even though Trian didn’t win any spots on Disney’s board, the firm got what it wanted, which is the whole point of an activist investor campaign. In a statement issued after the meeting, Trian said they were disappointed with the election results, but “proud of the impact we have had in refocusing this Company on value creation and good governance. Since we re-engaged with the Company in late 2023, Disney has announced a host of new operating initiatives and capital improvement plans.”\n\nSprawling mega-companies like Disney represent one portion of the business landscape, but different businesses have vastly different models. Marketplace companies built on individual contractors renting their skills, homes or goods are also a powerful force today. Taskrabbit CEO Ania Smith, who previously held high-level jobs at marketplace giants Uber and Airbnb, talked to me about the evolution of that space. An excerpt from our interview is later in this newsletter.\n\nHUMAN CAPITAL\n\nLast week had both good and bad news for workers. The good news: The U.S. added more jobs than expected in March—a grand total of 303,000, according to a report from the U.S. Labor Department. This moved the unemployment rate to 3.8%, extending the longest streak of unemployment below 4% since the 1960s, and beat analysts’ predictions of the number of jobs added. Hourly earnings also rose 4.1% from March 2023 to last month, keeping ahead of inflation and matching analysts’ projections.\n\nEven though so many jobs were added, March was the worst month for layoffs since January 2023. U.S. employers cut 90,309 jobs last month, according to a report from outplacement and career services firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas. More than a third were federal government job cuts in the U.S. Army and Veterans Affairs department. More than 250,000 total jobs were eliminated in the first quarter of 2024, with the tech sector seeing the deepest cuts, losing 42,442 jobs.\n\nWhat does this mean? Although job cuts are increasing, job growth is also red hot—and outpacing the losses. In Challenger, Gray and Christmas’s analysis, the largest number of layoffs was attributed to cost-cutting. As many businesses and investors are optimistic about growth through eventual interest rate cuts and new initiatives made possible by technology and AI, perhaps the need to cut costs will slow down.\n\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n\nGenerative AI has the potential to add capabilities to a wide range of industries, but developments in medicine and health care were on full display last week. The FDA cleared two AI-powered tools for clinical use: An algorithm developed by the Mayo Clinic and digital stethoscope maker Eko Health that can detect the heart ineffectively pumping blood—an early sign of heart disease—and a software tool that can use data to detect sepsis developed by AI company Prenosis. Those who developed the Eko Health algorithm told Forbes’ Alex Knapp that these applications can significantly affect patient outcomes. “These tools are incredibly powerful — they help us screen for conditions for which we have treatments,” said Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Chair Paul Friedman.\n\nIn general, many business AI applications involve intelligent chatbots, and a study published last week showed they can also be helpful in a healthcare setting. A Northwestern Medicine study in JAMA Network found ChatGPT was able to respond to questions about radiation oncology as well or better than trained professionals. The AI system was asked 115 common questions about radiation therapy or chemotherapy, and its answers were scored by three radiation oncologists and three radiation physicists. The only concern with the AI-generated responses flagged by the study was that some used complex medical jargon and may be difficult to understand. The study said this is an early indicator that AI could be a first line for patient information about cancer treatment—and help reduce workloads and burnout rates for physicians specializing in the disease.\n\nNOTABLE NEWS\n\nProgress toward gender equality in the C-suite has fallen for the first time in two decades, according to a report published last month by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The firm, which has tracked women’s representation in C-suite positions since 2005, found 11.8% of these jobs were held by women in 2023. This is down from 12.2% in 2022, and represents the first time there has been a decrease in this metric. One of the reasons may be less corporate emphasis on gender diversity. S&P looked at mentions of the issue in earnings calls, and found 2023 had the least mentions of the issue since 2012. Forbes contributor Soulaima Gourani writes this study should be a wake-up call for organizations to reassess their commitment to gender diversity, since diverse leadership teams are proven to bring greater creativity, resilience and financial performance.\n\nTOMORROW’S TRENDS\n\nTaskrabbit CEO Ania Smith On The Evolution Of Marketplace Companies\n\nAnia Smith built her career in diverse businesses. She’s held senior positions at companies with traditional employees, including Expedia and Walmart, and nine years ago made a switch to marketplace businesses, where the service employees are gig workers. She worked with Airbnb and Uber before becoming Taskrabbit’s CEO in August 2020. I talked to her about her work with marketplace companies and how today’s economy has impacted the business. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.\n\nWhy have you wanted to keep working with marketplace companies?\n\nSmith: I didn’t wake up one day and go, ‘Oh, I want to go work in the gig economy space.’ What I did think about is I love travel as an industry, and so when I got a call from Airbnb, I thought, oh yes, I want to go back to travel because it's an amazing space to be in. Fairly quickly I realized…what made Airbnb so much different is the gig economy piece of it, meaning all of our hosts who were just everyday people looking to rent out their space. My role was to help to work with our hosts, and that became extremely motivating, because I started thinking not only about why they come and what motivates them to come to our site.\n\nWhether it’s for Airbnb, or couriers at Uber Eats, or taskers here at Taskrabbit, what I started thinking a lot about is how incredible it is that we live in an era where this is normal. Where 60 to 70 million people are doing some sort of side gig, and how I wish that these types of platforms would have existed two or three decades ago because I immigrated here from Poland, and my parents had to work a lot to make ends meet in traditional roles. You have to then deal with schedules, and you never could get enough hours. …It was just very hard, especially while they were raising two young kids. It would have been great to have any of these platforms available then, so they could use that opportunity to make that extra, meaningful income in a way that allowed them to do that with flexibility and with autonomy and with allowing them to figure out what their pricing is.\n\nI meet taskers all day, every day, and it’s really motivating to understand the impact that we're having on their lives. We just met with some taskers last week. This tasker’s a firefighter, but has really decided to lean in on TV mounting and some other skills, and she is really happy with the ability to make that extra income while she has her other job.\n\nYou’ve been at the helm of Taskrabbit through the Covid-19 pandemic, the great resignation and high inflation. Through all of that, how have things changed?\n\nAll this is happening quite fast, and more and more people are searching for that flexibility and autonomy, which means our tasker population has continued to grow at really high rates. For the first time, we have to start thinking about [whether there] are perhaps too many taskers in a metro area. …We’ve been focused on trying to manage both sides of the marketplace so that as we have more taskers coming on board who want to help, we also want to have as many new customers come on board who need that help. Because at the end of the day, that’s the crux of managing the marketplace.\n\nIt is very quantitative and very analytical, and there are many things that we can do as a company that helps to optimize both the demand and the supply side of the business. We do that by thinking a lot about locations: Do we have enough taskers in certain zip codes? Or maybe we do have enough taskers, but they all know how to do cleaning or yard work, and not enough of them know how to assemble furniture. So maybe perhaps we need to go out and tell our story more and make sure that we get more taskers who can assemble furniture. Or maybe in another location. …There’s also pricing and timing and so on.\n\nWe do that every day, and use a lot of machine learning and a lot of smart technologies to help us to think about how to optimize the marketplace so that it’s the best experience for both our taskers and our clients. Because at the end of the day, what we don’t want is our clients coming to our app and looking for someone to help them with yard work, and seeing that there is no one there who can do it. Or maybe there are people who can do it, but not for another two weeks. At the same time, we don’t want taskers signing up and just waiting for jobs and not getting any. They count on us to make that income.\n\nHow has public perception and use of marketplace companies changed in the nine years you’ve been involved with them?\n\nWhen these companies were launching, it was so new and took a lot of money and a lot of financing from venture funds to build the market, because it didn’t quite exist. And then we went through this whole phase of Uber for everything. I think over time, the acceptance has grown as customers have realized the ease and the convenience of using some of these services. On the supply side, hosts and drivers and couriers and taskers have really learned to lean in and use these platforms to help them…to feel a lot more independent.\n\nThen the pandemic hit, and I think that just turbo-charged the entire business. It was explosive growth for all of these main platforms for a variety of reasons. How we really evolved our thinking on travel and what we wanted to do, how we evolved thinking about delivery, and how we evolved thinking about having more flexibility. How we think about our time today is very different. It’s become more precious and people, I think, are more open to outsourcing some tasks that allow them to have more time to spend with their families, or spend on their hobbies. I think this area is only going to continue to grow.\n\nFACTS + COMMENTS\n\nTesla is scrapping plans to build low-cost electric vehicles, Reuters reported Friday, and instead plans to put more resources into creating robotaxis.

      "# [Cachet, Taskrabbit team up on insurance for gig workers by soumyasharma on 2024-09-24](https://www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com/news/cachet-taskrabbit-insurance-gig-workers/)\nCachet, a company specialising in personalised insurance for the gig economy, has joined forces with Taskrabbit to launch a custom insurance package for gig workers across Europe.\n\nThe collaboration aims to provide financial security solutions that align with the flexible work arrangements of ‘taskers’, a term used by the companies for gig workers.\n\nTaskrabbit, a platform connecting individuals with local skilled workers for home assistance, is set to enhance the working experience of its taskers.\n\nThese independent contractors, who value the autonomy of choosing their work schedule and location, will gain the added benefit of insurance coverage that adapts to their working lifestyle.\n\nThe Tasker-Customised Insurance Package is currently available in six European countries.\n\nThis offering is designed to provide taskers with financial stability by protecting against income loss from accidents and providing compensation for family, or compassionate leave.\n\nIn addition, the package is projected to offer long-term support for partial or total disablement incurred during tasks.\n\nThis comprehensive insurance solution ensures that taskers can continue to enjoy the freedom of gig work while being assured of strong financial protection, Cachet noted.\n\nCommenting on the latest partnership, Cachet CEO Hedi Mardisoo said: “Taskrabbit is a pioneer in the platform economy, and together with our partner Hiscox insurance we are enabling a solution that mirrors the flexibility and dynamism of the gig economy.\n\n“Taskers can choose how and when they work, with the financial security they need to thrive. We are proud to add Taskrabbit to our growing community of platforms using Cachet’s technology to enable the platform economy lifestyle.”\n\nHighlighting the importance of responding to tasker feedback, Taskrabbit Europe managing director Begüm Zarmann said: “It is of utmost importance for Taskrabbit to cater to the evolving needs of our taskers across European markets. As a direct result of feedback, we received from taskers on how we could improve their experience.”\n\nZarmann added: “Taskrabbit is thrilled to launch this partnership with Cachet to expand the way we care for our ever-growing community, including supporting taskers’ flexibility and independence at work and in their personal lives.”",
      "# [Toward a Geographic Understanding of the Sharing Economy: Systemic Biases in UberX and TaskRabbit: ACM Transactions on Computer by MN View Profile, Brent Hecht Northwestern University, IL View Profile, Brent Hecht, Thebault-SpiekerJacob](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3058499)\nresearch-article\n\nPublic Access\n\nToward a Geographic Understanding of the Sharing Economy: Systemic Biases in UberX and TaskRabbit\n\nAbstract\n\nDespite the geographically situated nature of most sharing economy tasks, little attention has been paid to the role that geography plays in the sharing economy. In this article, we help to address this gap in the literature by examining how four key principles from human geography—distance decay, structured variation in population density, mental maps, and “the Big Sort” (spatial homophily)—manifest in sharing economy platforms. We find that these principles interact with platform design decisions to create systemic biases in which the sharing economy is significantly more effective in dense, high socioeconomic status (SES) areas than in low-SES areas and the suburbs. We further show that these results are robust across two sharing economy platforms: UberX and TaskRabbit. In addition to highlighting systemic sharing economy biases, this article more fundamentally demonstrates the importance of considering well-known geographic principles when designing and studying sharing economy platforms.\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nPragya Agarwal. 2001.

      "# [Cachet partners with Taskrabbit by Avi Ben-Hutta on 2024-09-23](https://coverager.com/cachet-partners-with-taskrabbit/)\nCachet, which designs insurance products for platforms and micromobility, has partnered with TaskRabbit to introduce a new insurance offering in six European countries.\n\nUnderwritten by Hiscox, freelancers providing services through Taskerabbit will now be able to secure coverage for income loss due to accidents, family leave and long-term disability.\n\n“Taskrabbit is a pioneer in the platform economy, and together with our partner Hiscox insurance we’re enabling a solution that mirrors the flexibility and dynamism of the gig economy. Taskers can choose how and when they work, with the financial security they need to thrive. We are proud to add Taskrabbit to our growing community of platforms using Cachet’s technology to enable the platform economy lifestyle.” – Hedi Mardisoo, CEO of Cachet.\n\n“It’s of utmost importance for Taskrabbit to cater to the evolving needs of our Taskers across European markets. As a direct result of feedback we received from Taskers on how we could improve their experience. Taskrabbit is thrilled to launch this partnership with Cachet to expand the way we care for our ever-growing community, including supporting Taskers’ flexibility and independence at work and in their personal lives.” – Begüm Zarmann, Managing Director Europe at Taskrabbit.",
      "# [Taskrabbit Competitors: 8 Alternatives for Lead Generation](https://www.servicetitan.com/blog/taskrabbit-competitors)\nTaskrabbit is an online marketplace and mobile app where consumers can find local service providers for jobs such as handyman tasks and yard work. For some home services contractors (in particular, independent contractors or small businesses), the app can be an option for finding leads.\n\nBut Taskrabbit tends to be used more for one-off tasks, like furniture assembly or moving, rather than providing loyal customers who return to you time and again for their plumbing or HVAC services. That’s why many home service providers look for Taskrabbit competitors.\n\nIn this post, we’ll cover 8 websites that are like Taskrabbit.\n\nIn addition, we’ll explain how our software solution, ServiceTitan, offers alternative ways to attract potential customers, track leads, and convert them into actual booked jobs where customers are more likely to stay with you long-term.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Taskrabbit?\n\n8 Taskrabbit alternatives\n\nHow ServiceTitan helps you generate leads & book jobs\n\nWhat is Taskrabbit?\n\nTaskrabbit is a site that matches handy people and contractors (known as “Taskers”) with consumers searching for particular home services in their local area.\n\nWhile it was started for handy people looking for extra money in the gig economy, Taskrabbit offers a whopping 50 categories of services in seven main areas:\n\nAssembly\n\nMounting\n\nMoving\n\nCleaning\n\nOutdoor help\n\nHome repairs\n\nPainting\n\nFor a registration fee of $25 (applicable in eligible cities you register with), you can sign up for the categories that apply to your business in your specific location(s). Taskrabbit will ask you to confirm your identity and to submit any business verifications, if required. Once you’ve completed your profile, you can set up your weekly availability including opting in for same-day jobs, if you wish.\n\nYour profile details (including skill set, hourly rate and any reviews from past customers using the platform) can be viewed by local clients searching the site for your services. Taskrabbit’s user-friendly mobile app (compatible with iOS and Android) lets you chat with prospective clients and manage and track jobs as well as payments. Contractors can submit invoices via Taskrabbit and get paid through the app’s secure payment system.\n\nAlthough Taskrabbit includes home services like plumbing and electrical work, it focuses more on one-off tasks and odd jobs, like fixing a leaky faucet or mending a light fitting. So, while it could be a useful source for small businesses and independent contractors just starting out — or to make extra income during the slow season — it typically isn’t very effective for finding long-term, loyal customers wanting more heavyweight home services, like an A/C installation or a bathroom refit, for example.\n\nFor those, you need to have solid fundamental business practices in place (like the ability to track and measure all of your marketing channels and to deliver outstanding customer service) along with the ability to deploy more established marketing activities (like email campaigns and Google Local Services Ads).\n\nThat’s where our software solution, ServiceTitan, can help.\n\nFirst, here’s our list of eight stand-out Taskrabbit alternatives.\n\n8 Best Taskrabbit Alternatives\n\nCare.com\n\nHandy\n\nJobble\n\nNextdoor\n\nPorch\n\nTalkLocal\n\nThumbtack\n\nWonolo\n\n1. Care.com\n\nCare.com is a site that’s predominantly used to help people find babysitters, housekeepers, and caregivers for the elderly. But it also has a small section for hiring people for errands and odd jobs, like general home repairs and maintenance.\n\nThe advantage of using this Taskrabbit competitor is the jobs generally pay well, but not without an upfront investment. To see and apply for local jobs, service providers have to become Premium Members. With a Premium Membership, providers rank higher, get job alerts faster, and are able to more easily communicate with potential clients.\n\nGiven the extremely small portion of this app devoted to home services, the value of that investment will probably depend on what mobile apps people tend to use in your area for home repair and maintenance jobs.\n\nDo more research on Care.com, its pricing, and how potential customers tend to use it before committing to the upgraded membership package.\n\n2. Handy\n\nHandy offers plenty of services through their website or app — users can book anything from home cleaning and general home maintenance to full-blown home improvement renovations.\n\nHandy conducts background checks, and service providers must be approved before taking on jobs. They must have paid experience, be authorized to work in the county they’re located in, and have great customer service skills. Once a service provider is approved, Handy will begin to send leads.\n\nThis handyman app boasts a 60-second booking process, so once you’re signed up and approved, leads could come in very quickly.\n\nHandy is available in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.\n\n3. Jobble\n\nJobble bills itself as the number one on-demand job app in the U.S. It’s hard to verify the accuracy of that statement, but one thing’s for sure: It’s a great place to pick up new clients.\n\nAlthough Jobble isn’t as focused on home services as Taskrabbit, users can view job listings in their area for free. After creating a profile, users can also apply to jobs without paying anything upfront.\n\nThis app doesn’t cater to residential needs and would instead be a good place to do some B2B work, like becoming the preferred plumber for an office complex, depending on the user’s area of expertise and the jobs available in their area.\n\n4. Nextdoor\n\nAn app aimed at connecting communities, Nextdoor is the world’s largest neighborhood social community networking service. It’s a great way to help spread important information and for local professionals to connect with potential clients in home improvement, landscaping, lawn care, and other home services.\n\nOn Nextdoor, business owners can create a listing for their business and encourage community members to use and review their services. Businesses can also participate in local conversations and connect with residents who need their services.\n\nAgain, this is a social website first and a lead generator second, so it shouldn’t be the primary means to find new clients. But it’s not to be ignored, either.\n\n5. Porch\n\nPorch is an industry-leader for handyman apps, with an excellent platform that includes moving assistance, painting, electrical, lawn care, furniture assembly, and other part-time local services.\n\nWhat’s great about this app is that it’s provider-driven. “Pros” (as they’re called on Porch) can set exact specifications for what type of jobs they want, and how frequently they want to buy and receive leads in the online marketplace.\n\nThis app also incentivizes quality for their pros. They offer a “Vetted Pros” program that includes a 5% discount on leads when purchased on demand. Vetted Pros also receive automatic lead credits when they meet the outreach requirements, yet don’t connect with homeowners.\n\n6. TalkLocal\n\nPrimarily focused on handyman services, TalkLocal includes a few types of jobs-for-hire you might not expect, including legal, landscaping, and office furniture rental.\n\nThis handyman app offers service provider assistance on a level most others don’t. TalkLocal makes initial contact with users and coordinates job logistics, without you having to do a thing. You have the option to accept each job individually, but TalkLocal remains the point of contact for the users. Depending on how hands-on you like to be, this could be a great feature.\n\nThe app takes its service a step further by requiring service providers to only pay for leads they’ve booked.\n\n7. Thumbtack\n\nWhether users want to find a wedding planner or a welder, chances are they’ll find them on Thumbtack. This app features over 500 service categories across a wide range of industries and covers all 50 states.\n\nAs a service provider, you’ll like how this app offers geolocation to show users which providers are in their area. Thumbtack seamlessly enables professionals to market themselves as individuals or as local businesses.\n\nThis handyman app is free to join, and service providers can set preferences for where, when, and how they want to work so you only receive the leads you really want. And there’s no shortage of leads on Thumbtack — the app generates more than 30,000 leads per day.\n\n8. Wonolo\n\nAlthough not specifically geared toward handyman services, Wonolo is still a useful resource to establish new relationships with potential long-term clients. The growing staffing company is available in more than 30 cities in the United States.\n\nWonolo users have to be 18 years old, and they also must have a Social Security number. This could be a barrier to those without one or who do not wish to share their information. But a clear benefit is the ease of use, which makes it comparable to Taskrabbit.\n\nServiceTitan Helps Home Service Businesses Generate Leads & Book Jobs\n\nUsing Taskrabbit (or any of the other apps like Taskrabbit) could bring your service business a few one-off jobs and/or may be useful for filling in gaps during slow seasons. But to secure a solid pipeline of leads that results in booked jobs, repeat business, and a loyal customer base, you should have these five business fundamentals in place:\n\nUse tried-and-true marketing practices like email marketing, Google Local Services Ads, and direct mail — all trusted lead generators.\n\nEnsure you can convert leads into actual booked jobs with a reliable and repeatable call booking process.\n\nThe ability to track leads from all marketing channels so you can measure results and analyze what’s really working (and what’s not).\n\nAn efficient way to optimize customer reviews so that they help drive customers to your business.\n\nDeliver awesome customer service from beginning to end so your customers return to you time and again and recommend you to their friends.\n\nWe built our software, ServiceTitan, with tools to help home service professionals (like HVAC, plumbers, electricians, and landscaping businesses) do all of this. Here’s how it works.\n\nUse Tried-and-True Marketing Methods\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, Taskrabbit may generate a few leads for small, one-off jobs. But using tried-and-true marketing methods like email marketing and direct mail are deployed by many service businesses for one reason — they usually drive more highly qualified leads to your business than apps like Taskrabbit.\n\nIn addition, managing customer reviews won’t be an issue until you have a steady stream of incoming leads.\n\nServiceTitan’s Marketing Pro has been designed to help home services companies deliver tried-and-true marketing campaigns that will bring you more business. Here’s how:\n\nDeliver Hyper-Targeted Email Marketing\n\nTargeted email campaigns are among the most effective ways to attract business, earning $40 for every $1 spent. Aside from being a low-cost marketing channel (there’s no incremental cost of sending emails), marketing to people who already know you is more effective than “converting” strangers (from apps like Taskrabbit) so it’s a sound method of generating more work for your business.\n\nServiceTitan's email marketing feature allows you to send hyper-targeted email campaigns by segmenting your email audience by ZIP code, age of equipment, date of last service, new homeowner, and more. Using data already collected in ServiceTitan, you can target previous customers with a “We Miss You!” email campaign, follow up with existing customers on unsold estimates, or offer a discount to new homeowners.\n\nSending targeted emails with ServiceTitan is simple. Choose from our huge range of email templates, adjust the text to fit your campaign, and deliver to your chosen audience.\n\nYou can monitor the performance of your email campaigns via the ServiceTitan marketing scorecard.\n\nLeverage Direct Mail\n\nLikewise, using traditional direct mail to attract business from your local community works well for many service businesses.\n\nSeviceTitan’s Marketing Pro lets you automate direct mail campaigns that attract business in your local area. Choose from our library of postcards and send out a single postcard, or thousands, and pay a flat fee per item.\n\nAs with the email campaigns, you can select your audience from your customer lists — for example, those who have equipment that’s due to be updated — and send them a postcard reminding them of your equipment replacement services. Upload your chosen design, adjust the text, print, and mail to your selected audience.\n\nYou can track the results of your direct mail campaigns via the ServiceTitan dashboard and see which ones are driving revenue.\n\nDrive More Leads with Google Local Services Ads\n\nGoogle Local Services Ads are a cost-effective way to drive leads to your business, and ServiceTitan’s Google Ads integration simplifies the entire process.\n\nBuying Google Local Services Ads increases the likelihood of your business appearing at the top of the Google search results page, above the PPC ads and organic listings. This means potential customers can view a snapshot of your business — such as your company name, Google review rating, and years in business — to determine whether your company fits their needs.\n\nCosts for Google Local Services Ads vary, but you only pay when a customer contacts your business through the ad. This cuts down on job leads from customers who are simply price-shopping.\n\nServiceTitan integrates with Google Local Services Ads to allow homeowners to directly schedule online appointments with your company, and provides business owners with ROI metrics on every campaign. This makes the whole process easier for the customer and improves the chances of them booking an appointment with your company.\n\nConvert Leads into Actual Bookings\n\nWhichever marketing channels you choose to generate leads, it’s critical to convert those leads into actual booked jobs when those customers contact your business.\n\nProviding your CSRs (customer service reps) with a clear, repeatable process for when customers call your company, is a good way to achieve that repeatability and increases the chance of them making a booking.\n\nServiceTitan’s call booking software helps CSRs provide a polished customer experience as soon as they answer the phone. Our software shows them who’s calling (if they are an existing customer) so they can greet them by name, which sets up the entire call on a friendly, open basis. Whether they are an existing customer or a potential one, CSRs can use our customized prompts to ask the right questions and ensure they get all the information your techs will need quickly and efficiently.\n\nHaving an efficient call booking process in place ensures customers (new or existing) are given a stellar experience from the first moment they call your business.\n\nTrack & Measure All Marketing Channels\n\nAn issue with using apps like Taskrabbit is that when you choose to expand your marketing to several channels (like the ones we recommend above), it’s difficult to know where your leads are coming from when customers contact your business, and which ones translate into actual jobs. You need software that tracks and analyzes each one.\n\nServiceTitan helps you make informed decisions on which marketing activities to focus on (whether that’s Taskrabbit, Taskrabbit alternatives, or channels like email marketing or direct mail). Our software offers campaign tracking telephone numbers and real-time ROI reporting for all your marketing campaigns.\n\nFor each campaign, you can track the number of calls, how many jobs you booked from those calls, and the number of sales made from those jobs, all from your ServiceTitan dashboard.\n\nWith ServiceTitan, you can view your metrics via our marketing scorecard, which shows your current marketing campaigns (email, direct mail, Google Local Services Ads, etc.) and ties all new customers to the specific marketing campaign that brought them to you.\n\nBecause the scorecard ranks all your marketing channels by revenue, you know exactly how much business you’re getting for every dollar you spend so you can boost spending on campaigns with higher returns and drop channels with poor performance.\n\nOptimize Customer Reviews\n\nIn our experience, and that of the thousands of home service businesses that use ServiceTitan, managing and replying to your customer reviews (good or bad) is critical to your business, because customers place a great deal of importance on them when choosing a service provider. Not only does this apply to the reviews that you’ll receive on Taskrabbit (if you choose to use it) but also other online platforms such as Google, Yelp, and Angi.\n\nHowever, managing reviews is often a task that slips to the bottom of the to-do list, simply because it’s time-consuming and tedious, especially when the reviews are in several different places.\n\nServiceTitan’s Marketing Pro helps make this process more efficient by collecting reviews from all of your platforms so you can manage and reply within ServiceTitan.\n\nOur software helps:\n\nGenerate more reviews with automated requests: ServiceTitan sends out survey requests via text or email as soon as a job has been completed. This encourages customers to share their experience while it’s still fresh in their minds.\n\nConsolidate all your reviews in one place: Set up alerts so you can read and respond to reviews from all your review platforms (Yelp, Google Reviews, and apps like Taskrabbit), directly from the ServiceTitan dashboard. This saves time because there’s no need to go into each review site individually and customers receive responses more quickly.\n\nTrack and match reviews to specific techs & jobs: Because all your review data is stored centrally within ServiceTitan, you can see exactly what’s working and what’s not, and use these insights to reward or coach individuals.\n\nKeep review listings consistent and updated: There’s no need to frequently check and update company listings on apps like Taskrabbit because ServiceTitan ensures your company details are accurately listed across 60+ business listing sites. This means search engines will correctly attribute them to you and customers can easily find you. You can try our free listings scan tool here.\n\nDeliver Awesome Customer Service\n\nWithout a doubt, delivering awesome customer service right from the first point of contact through to the delivery and billing of your services is the most important way to attract customers and grow your service business.\n\nTravis Ringe of ProSkill Services, a $14 million full-service home services company in Arizona with more than 5,000 5-star Google reviews, explains that his CSRs and techs go above and beyond by always offering to do more, such as providing ladder service to help elderly customers change lightbulbs or smoke detector batteries, or simply bringing the trash can from the curb.\n\nNot only does this increase the probability of your customers using you again, but they’re also more likely to recommend your services to their friends and family.\n\nIn addition to our call booking tool, ServiceTitan also helps you deliver exceptional customer service with these features:\n\nScheduling and dispatching features that match the right technician to the right job and ensure they arrive on time.\n\nAutomated texts that confirm appointment times and provide customers with links to their tech and a GPS tracker so they know who is coming and when.\n\nEstimate and proposal templates that techs can build while on a job and show to customers via a mobile app.\n\nCustomer financing to help customers choose what’s best for their budget.\n\nPayment processing tools with flexible and convenient payment options for customers.\n\nAnd more!\n\nAll of these tools are fully integrated and communicate with each other so you never have to spend time transferring information from elsewhere.\n\nReady to Generate More Leads with ServiceTitan?\n\nApps like Taskrabbit might be useful for generating one-time jobs if you’re a small business with a limited marketing budget or if you’re just starting out. But using software like ServiceTitan to execute tried-and-true marketing campaigns (like email and direct mail) as well as track leads from all of your marketing channels and convert them into actual booked jobs will attract loyal customers who return to you time and again.",
      "# [I'm a retiree who assembles furniture on Taskrabbit to avoid draining my retirement fund. At 79, I also like having structure and meeting new people. on 2024-12-16](https://www.bundle.app/en/finance/i'm-a-retiree-who-assembles-furniture-on-taskrabbit-to-avoid-draining-my-retirement-fund.-at-79-i-a-0905a185-9806-45a9-b86d-74b8195d3057)\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dan Weiss, a 79-year-old Tasker on Taskrabbit in Oakdale, Minnesota. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI joined Taskrabbit in 2021 and have completed nearly 1,200 tasks at around $47 per hour for my services in Ikea furniture and general furniture assembly in and around Minneapolis.\n\nI have a bachelor's degree in business administration and management and two master's degrees. Before I retired in November 2014, I managed several residential mortgage branches for a major bank.\n\nRetirement was fine initially, but I quickly realized I needed to add structure to my life. Now, I fill my days building furniture, meeting new people, and supplementing my retirement income.\n\nGoing from 100 MPH to zero was a very abrupt change for me\n\nOne can only do so much gardening and reading without feeling unfulfilled.\n\nI stayed \"retired\" for about six months and then had to find something that gave me more enjoyment and provided additional income to avoid chipping away at all of my retirement savings, which I began saving for in my mid-40s.\n\nBefore Taskrabbit, my other part-time jobs included stints at Costco, customer service work, and driving for Uber and Lyft.\n\nI read an article in my local newspaper about a young woman who had discovered Taskrabbit. It intrigued me, so I immediately went online to create a Tasker account and have them run a background check on me. That was completed in a matter of days, and I was ready to go.\n\nRelated stories\n\nI've now been Tasking for 3 years\n\nI've always enjoyed assembling things, but there was a learning curve. Although I had previously worked with Ikea furniture, there was much to figure out about some of the \"tricks\" associated with Ikea products.\n\nI made over $47,000 in 2023, my highest year in earnings yet. I average $3,000 to $5,000 in earnings monthly. I could live on my retirement savings if I had to, but Taskrabbit income helps.\n\nI do tasks almost daily\n\nI complete between one and three tasks daily, averaging about four to five days a week. Most of my tasks are no more than a half-hour away, but I spend a fair amount of time driving. I can expense the mileage and gas.\n\nMy time spent with clients is highly enjoyable. I meet people from all walks of life and find their stories interesting. I enjoy this aspect of tasking the most.\n\nI've realized how fulfilling and also challenging retirement can be\n\nThe lack of structure and income flow in retirement is challenging. We're told to save, save, save for retirement, and that's what I did. When I made the change from saving to spending, I was mind-blown. It didn't feel comfortable or natural.\n\nTaskrabbit has allowed me to continue to generate income while also providing structure and allowing me to maintain contact with a variety of people.\n\nI've discovered the importance of superb reviews in growing my business\n\nWhen I was young, there were no such things as digital reviews. Today, they're critical because everyone checks them before booking a service or going to a restaurant. I secure generally excellent reviews by doing the following steps:\n\nAlways communicate openly with your client. Confirm the date and time and set expectations in advance.\n\nArrive on time or slightly early. If you will be late, even by a few minutes, it's important to let them know.\n\nUpon arriving, be friendly and cordial. A handshake usually gets things off to a good start to establish a line of trust.\n\nBe efficient and ensure the task is completed properly and precisely. Having the correct tools is also mandatory for this aspect of the task.\n\nIf there are problems such as missing or defective parts, let the client know as soon as possible and provide suggestions on how to remedy the problem so as not to add stress to their plate.\n\nThank them for the work opportunity and share how they can save you as a favorite for future tasks, leave a review and, if they choose, tip you, which happens about 25-40% of the time. I'm very focused during the actual task, but if the client engages me in conversation or has questions, I stop and focus on them.\n\nI expect to continue to task as long as the compensation is commensurate with the job\n\nI will continue to do this as long as my body holds up.\n\nTasking has given me both fulfillment and help funding trips and vacations. My wife and I love Maui and intend to return soon.\n\nI'm still in the planning phase of deciding on our next vacation destination. There are many other places that we wish to visit while we're still healthy and relatively mobile.\n\nAre you a retiree with a side hustle who wants to share your story?

      "# [Why Taskrabbit is stepping on the gas with retail partnerships by Andrew Adam Newman on 2024-06-11](https://www.retailbrew.com/stories/2024/06/11/why-taskrabbit-is-stepping-on-the-gas-with-retail-partnerships)\nThe jobs that gig workers line up on Taskrabbit can be stunningly random, from being hired to buy and deliver a whole branzino fish as a birthday gift to—oh, the humanity—dropping an ex’s items off after a breakup.\n\nBut certain popular gigs are not surprising at all, like moving and TV mounting, and Eric Haymond, Taskrabbit’s VP of business development, said the platform recently noticed a surge for a particular type of job.\n\n“We’ve seen a big increase in our customers really searching and looking for baby-related services,” Haymond told Retail Brew.\n\nTaskrabbit saw a 25% increase in bookings for nursery set-ups (including painting and assembling furniture and toys) and a 56% increase for baby-proofing jobs in the first three months of 2024 compared to the same period last year.\n\nNow the company is partnering with Joy, a universal wedding and baby registry site, to promote Taskrabbit gift certificates to expecting parents.\n\n“Hire Taskers as early as the same day to handle everything from cleaning your home to assembling cribs and more!” states the web page on Joy promoting the gift certificates, which are available in denominations of $100–$300.\n\nHaymond, a father of three, said he spent way too much time baby-proofing and painting after his progeny arrived.\n\n“I did a lot of stupid things [that] took a lot of my time instead of spending time with our newborns,” he said. “Taskrabbit’s greatest quality is that gift of time that is so tough today.”\n\nThe wrench connection: It should come as no surprise that Taskrabbit is partnering with retailers since it is, after all, owned by one. In 2017, Ikea purchased the company, originally called RunMyErrand when founded by Leah Busque in 2008.\n\nThe purchase made sense as a pain-point reliever for Ikea, which while widely lauded for its designs and prices, is also known for short-circuiting some Allen key-wielding consumers attempting to assemble its flat-packed products. (The year Ikea purchased Taskrabbit, New York magazine called the store a “relationship death trap,” for the tension some couples experience both agreeing on furniture in its arrow-emblazoned aisles and, once home, assembling it.)\n\nAt the time of the acquisition, Ikea stores in London were already partnering with Taskrabbit to assemble furniture. Haymond, who was working at Ikea as executive VP of strategy and business development in the US when it purchased the platform, transferred to Taskrabbit in 2019 to help roll out its assembling services in stores worldwide.\n\nToday, Ikea customers are invited to book a “Tasker” in countries including the US, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and Italy.\n\nWhile Haymond declined to say what percentage of Ikea shoppers choose Taskrabbit, he said that “a reasonable amount of their customers are getting assembly” via the platform and that it varies by country, with Italy and Spain choosing Taskrabbit a bit more than countries like the US, which is “actually a little more DIY.”\n\nTaskrabbit redux: Taskrabbit has also partnered with other brands, including Uplift Desk, the standing (or sitting) desk brand, which links to Taskrabbit in its “Installation Help” section.\n\nHappy Beds, a UK bedroom furniture company, also links to Taskrabbit on its e-commerce site, where it notes it earns a “small commission” when customers choose the service, which the platform confirmed with Retail Brew is typical with its retail partnerships.\n\n“We partnered with Taskrabbit to help you get set up quickly and easily,” another partner, Windmill, the air conditioner brand, explains on its website. “With same-day and affordable options, you can leave the heavy lifting to us.”\n\nAnother gig-worker marketplace, Handy, has partnered with Walmart, Wayfair, and Crate & Barrel. Handy even pitches partnerships with retailers on its website.\n\n“Today’s customers expect convenience and a one-stop-shop experience from retailers,” states the Handy website. “Providing an end-to-end purchase and installation experience for your customers will create competitive advantages and drive increased revenue for you.”\n\nHare to stay: Taskrabbit sees its retail partnerships as symbiotic.\n\n“​​There’s a really strong mutual benefit,” Haymond said, explaining that when retailers assure customers that help to assemble purchases is a click away, it helps them “sell more home furnishings or whatever it might be.”\n\nFor Taskrabbit, the partnerships are—in business parlance—a customer acquisition tool.\n\n“Many if not most of the customers are first-time customers when they come to us through a partnership,” Haymond said. “It’s definitely most of the time a new channel for someone—a new way for us to get a customer.”\n\nIn other words, they may come to Taskrabbit through Joy to assemble a bassinet, but the next time they use the service, it might be to procure a branzino.\n\n“We work to make sure that they come back and use us for moving help or painting help or whatever else might be a service that they need in their life,” Haymond said.",

      "# [Tasker Roundup: 6 Updates You Don’t Want to Miss by Matt Beier on 2024-11-06](https://www.taskrabbit.ca/blog/tasker-roundup-6-updates-you-dont-want-to-miss/)\nThis season, we’re helping you harvest your earnings with a new feature that automatically pays you a fee for qualifying client cancellations, new Elite criteria, and new partnerships. Read on to learn how to take advantage of these changes!\n\n1. Cancellation fees are now automated!\n\nIf your client cancels a task within 24 hours of the agreed-upon start time, you’ll now automatically receive a cancellation fee payment—meaning you no longer have to contact Customer Support to collect these fees, which will save you time and hassle.\n\nNote: Note that this applies to all qualifying tasks for Taskers who are in good standing with Taskrabbit and don’t have any Terms of Service violations. Please give our system 48 hours for the payout notification to come through before contacting Support with questions. We’re excited to bring you this feature that Taskers have been asking for!\n\n2. New monthly office hours with your Tasker Success team\n\nTasker Success Managers will soon be hosting monthly group office hours, where Taskers will get the same personal guidance they are used to, but in a group setting. This will give attending Taskers the chance to connect with and learn from other Taskers—a great way to build community on the Taskrabbit platform. Keep an eye on your inbox for invites from your Tasker Success Manager in the coming months!\n\n3. Updated Elite criteria\n\nWe’ve adjusted the Elite criteria so that Taskers with a Performance score in the top 35% will qualify and appear with the associated badge in client search results. These changes are now reflected in your app!\n\n4. New LG Electronics Partnership\n\nTaskrabbit has partnered with LG to bring you more clients for Appliance Installation & Repairs tasks. These task invitations will appear just like any other general marketplace tasks in the Tasker app. More Taskrabbit clients on the platform means more tasking opportunities for you. We’re excited to market Tasker services on your behalf to help you grow your business!\n\nAlso, if you’re in the market for new electronic products, LG is offering Canadian Taskers the following two discount codes for any items purchased on LG.com:\n\n“LG-TASK-HE-IT-5” = 5% off home entertainment, laptops, and monitors*\n\n“LG-TASK-HA-10” = 10% off on home appliances*\n\nAll around, this partnership is a win-win!\n\n5. New policy updates for Tasker and client no-shows\n\nOur policy has been updated so that both Taskers and clients must give greater than 24 hours’ notice to cancel a task. This means that, under normal circumstances, you and clients must show up to a task at the agreed-upon scheduled or rescheduled start date, time, and location. In instances where clients allow you to complete a task without being present, they should be prepared (e.g. granting you remote access, providing clear instructions, etc.). If a client is not present and has not provided instructions so you can complete the task, it will be counted as a client no-show and may be eligible for a cancellation fee.\n\nAs a reminder, Taskers may only receive last-minute cancellation fees if they do not have any Terms of Service violations on their account in the last 90 days.\n\n6. Policy reminder for off-platform activity\n\nAs an important reminder, payments for services booked on Taskrabbit must be paid in full via Taskrabbit payment processing. This means:\n\nUsers are not allowed to request payment outside of Taskrabbit, in part or in full.\n\nYou must decline if a client requests to pay you off-platform.\n\nForms of off-platform payment should be reported.\n\nOff-platform payments violate the Terms of Service and can result in temporary or permanent account status changes, including account suspension and/or deactivation. Additionally, when payments happen off-platform, tasks are not covered by our Happiness Pledge.\n\nTasker Tip\n\nStreamline your business with chat templates. Did you know you can create and save custom messages and seamlessly pull them into chats with clients? That means no more annoying phone notes that you have to copy/paste into your Tasker App! To use this feature, simply create your chat templates in your profile settings, and then click the “+” sign next to your chat box to load the template and send it to your client. See it in action!\n\nFrançais"

    "# Taskrabbit Company and Product Analysis\n\n## Company Overview\n\nTaskrabbit, founded in 2008 by Leah Busque, is a platform that connects individuals with local service providers, known as \"Taskers,\" for various home assistance tasks. The company was acquired by IKEA in 2017, which has influenced its focus on home-related services, particularly furniture assembly and moving tasks [(Newman, Retail Brew, 2024-06-11)](https://www.retailbrew.com/stories/2024/06/11/why-taskrabbit-is-stepping-on-the-gas-with-retail-partnerships). Taskrabbit operates in multiple countries, including the U.S., Canada, and several European nations, and has expanded its service offerings to include over 50 categories, such as cleaning, outdoor help, and home repairs [(ServiceTitan, 2024-09-24)](https://www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com/news/cachet-taskrabbit-insurance-gig-workers/).\n\nIn recent years, Taskrabbit has been recognized for its workplace culture, being honored in Built In’s 2024 Best Places To Work Awards for the third consecutive year [(Taskrabbit Blog, 2024-06-11)](https://www.taskrabbit.com/blog/taskrabbit-news). The company has also focused on enhancing the experience of its Taskers, implementing features like automated cancellation fees and new partnerships to provide additional job opportunities [(Beier, Tasker Roundup, 2024-11-06)](https://www.taskrabbit.ca/blog/tasker-roundup-6-updates-you-dont-want-to-miss/).\n\n## Product Overview\n\nTaskrabbit's primary product is its online marketplace and mobile application, which allows users to find and hire Taskers for various tasks. The platform operates as a two-sided marketplace, where clients can post tasks and Taskers can accept them. Taskers are independent contractors who set their own rates and schedules, providing services under their own names rather than Taskrabbit's brand [(Taskrabbit Global Terms of Service, 2024-02-21)](https://support.taskrabbit.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008913792-Taskrabbit-Global-Terms-of-Service).\n\n### Recent Developments\n\n1. **Partnerships**: Taskrabbit has recently partnered with Cachet to offer customized insurance packages for Taskers in six European countries. This initiative aims to provide financial security for gig workers, covering income loss due to accidents and offering long-term disability support [(Ben-Hutta, Cachet partners with Taskrabbit, 2024-09-23)](https://coverager.com/cachet-partners-with-taskrabbit/).\n\n2. **Service Demand Trends**: The platform has observed a significant increase in demand for baby-related services, with a 25% rise in nursery setup bookings and a 56% increase in baby-proofing jobs in early 2024 compared to the previous year [(Newman, Retail Brew, 2024-06-11)](https://www.retailbrew.com/stories/2024/06/11/why-taskrabbit-is-stepping-on-the-gas-with-retail-partnerships).\n\n3. **User Experience Enhancements**: Taskrabbit has introduced features such as automated cancellation fees for clients who cancel tasks within 24 hours, streamlining the payment process for Taskers [(Beier, Tasker Roundup, 2024-11-06)](https://www.taskrabbit.ca/blog/tasker-roundup-6-updates-you-dont-want-to-miss/).\n\n## Financial Performance and Scale\n\nWhile specific revenue figures for Taskrabbit are not publicly disclosed, the platform has seen substantial growth in its user base and task volume. In 2023, a Tasker reported earning over $47,000, indicating the potential for significant income through the platform [(Weiss, Business Insider, 2024-12-16)](https://www.bundle.app/en/finance/i'm-a-retiree-who-assembles-furniture-on-taskrabbit-to-avoid-draining-my-retirement-fund.-at-79-i-a-0905a185-9806-45a9-b86d-74b8195d3057). The company continues to expand its reach and service offerings, which suggests a positive trajectory in terms of financial performance.\n\n## Executive Insights\n\nAnia Smith, the CEO of Taskrabbit since August 2020, has emphasized the importance of flexibility and autonomy for Taskers. In a recent interview, she noted, \"I wish that these types of platforms would have existed two or three decades ago... It would have been great to have any of these platforms available then, so they could use that opportunity to make that extra, meaningful income\" [(Poinski, Forbes, 2024-04-07)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/04/07/taskrabbit-ceo-talks-about-the-evolution-of-gig-economy-companies/). Smith's leadership has been pivotal in navigating the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the evolving gig economy landscape.\n\n## Market Position and Competitors\n\nTaskrabbit operates in a competitive landscape with several alternatives, including Handy, Thumbtack, and Care.com. While Taskrabbit is primarily focused on one-off tasks, competitors like Handy offer a broader range of home services, including ongoing maintenance and repairs [(ServiceTitan, 2024-09-24)](https://www.servicetitan.com/blog/taskrabbit-competitors). Taskrabbit's unique positioning as a platform for quick, flexible tasks, particularly in the home improvement sector, allows it to maintain a distinct market presence.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTaskrabbit has established itself as a leader in the gig economy, particularly in the home services sector. With a focus on enhancing the Tasker experience, expanding service offerings, and forming strategic partnerships, the company is well-positioned for continued growth. Prospective candidates and investors should consider Taskrabbit's innovative approach to the gig economy and its commitment to supporting its workforce as key factors in its ongoing success."
