  "summary_markdown": "# About Taskrabbit\n\nTaskrabbit is a marketplace platform that connects individuals needing assistance with local \"Taskers\" who can provide various services. Founded in 2008, Taskrabbit was acquired by the Ingka Group (IKEA) in 2017, which has significantly influenced its growth and service offerings. The company operates in thousands of cities across nine countries, including Canada, France, Monaco, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and is available in over 200 IKEA stores worldwide [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/taskrabbit).\n\nTaskrabbit offers a wide range of services, such as handyman services, moving assistance, furniture assembly (notably for IKEA products), cleaning services, lawn care, and virtual assistance tasks like data entry and personal assistant services. The platform facilitates these services through its website and mobile app, allowing users to book services with options for same-day availability [(TaskRabbit, 2022)](https://www.taskrabbit.com/blog/tasker-stories-an-unlikely-friendship).\n\nThe company primarily operates on a B2C model, serving individuals and families who require help with everyday tasks. Taskrabbit's mission is to create a better everyday life for people by facilitating connections between neighbors and providing opportunities for individuals to earn a meaningful income on their own terms [(LeadIQ, 2023)](https://leadiq.com/c/taskrabbit/5a1d8819240000240061e8f8).\n\nTaskrabbit has experienced growth in its user base and Tasker population, particularly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, which accelerated the acceptance of gig economy services. The integration with IKEA has reportedly increased the share of shoppers purchasing assembly services by 50% and reduced returns by 40% [(Walk-Morris & Howland, Retail Dive, 2025)](https://www.retaildive.com/news/ikea-streamlines-taskrabbit-furniture-assembly-service-checkout/740315/).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nAnia Smith has been the CEO of Taskrabbit since August 2020. She has a background in marketplace companies like Airbnb and Uber. Smith has focused on optimizing the Taskrabbit platform to meet the evolving needs of both Taskers and clients. She emphasizes the importance of flexibility and autonomy in the gig economy, noting that the Tasker population has continued to grow at high rates [(Poinski, Forbes, 2024)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/04/07/taskrabbit-ceo-talks-about-the-evolution-of-gig-economy-companies/).\n\n# News\n\n## Market Expansion and Partnerships\n\nTaskrabbit has scaled its partnership with IKEA across North America and Europe, enhancing its service offerings and streamlining user experiences. This partnership has been a significant factor in Taskrabbit's growth and market position [(Business Wire, 2025-02-14)](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250213865024/en/Taskrabbit-Scales-Partnership-with-IKEA-Across-North-America-and-Europe).\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nThe errand services market, which includes companies like Taskrabbit, is expected to reach USD 45.29 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 8.67% [(Straits Research Private Limited - Garner Insights, 2025-03-20)](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/03/20/3046253/0/en/Errand-Services-Market-Size-is-Expected-to-Reach-USD-45-29-billion-by-2033-Growing-at-a-CAGR-of-8-67-Market-Strides.html). Additionally, the smart home installation service market is forecasted to reach USD 10.74 billion by 2033, indicating potential growth areas for Taskrabbit [(Eric Johns, 2025-03-12)](https://www.einpresswire.com/article/793087510/smart-home-installation-service-market-growth-expected-forecast-to-reach-10-74-billion-by-2033).\n\n## Gig Economy and Side Hustles\n\nTaskrabbit is frequently mentioned in discussions about side hustles and gig economy opportunities. Articles highlight the platform as a viable option for earning extra income, with some Taskers reportedly earning significant amounts through the platform [(Alex Nelson, 2025-03-07)](https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/jobs-best-easy-side-hustles-using-a-phone-5022758); [(Kathy Kristof, 2025-03-02)](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-03-02/sidehusl-ab5).\n\n## User Experience\n\nTaskers on the platform have shared positive experiences, emphasizing the flexibility and income opportunities that Taskrabbit provides. For example, Dan Weiss, a 79-year-old Tasker, has completed nearly 1,200 tasks, earning an average of $47 per hour, which has added structure to his retirement and allowed him to meet new people [(Blumberg, Business Insider, 2024)](https://www.businessinsider.com/supplement-retirement-savings-doing-tasks-taskrabbit-retiree-2024-12).\n\nOverall, Taskrabbit stands out as a significant player in the gig economy, leveraging its partnership with IKEA to enhance its service offerings and streamline user experiences. With a strong leadership team and a growing user base, Taskrabbit is well-positioned for continued growth in the evolving marketplace landscape.",

      "# [About TaskRabbit: Who We Are and How We Got Here.](https://www.taskrabbit.com/announcements)\nAs restrictions are lifted across regions and cities, we ask the TaskRabbit community to remain mindful of all public health guidance and regulations in your area, especially since they may change from one day to the next. If your area allows in-person contact, please feel free to book these tasks. However, if a task can be done in a contactless or virtual way, we encourage taking these precautions.\n\nA contactless task is one that maintains social distancing of at least 6 feet/2 meters from another person. For example, you can request your Tasker perform the task outside, in a separate room, or offsite (e.g. leaving a delivery at your door). Instructions for contactless tasks can be indicated in the booking details and/or via task chat.\n\nYou may also request that a task be done virtually via chat, a call, or video. For example, you can have a Tasker complete data entry or personal assistant work virtually or guide you through a furniture assembly via a video call. Just let your Tasker know in your task description how you’d like to complete the task virtually.\n\nIf you are experiencing symptoms of illness, please let your Tasker know. Both you and your Tasker should take appropriate precautions to perform the task in a contactless or virtual way.\n\nThese are uncertain and confusing times and we want to do what we can to provide you with information to help you and your business get through it. The information below is our effort to share recent financial assistance programs that may be of interest to you as an independent contractor and user of the TaskRabbit platform. TaskRabbit is, of course, not affiliated with the financial assistance programs listed here, and cannot advise on program eligibility or how to apply for any of the programs listed. Please consult the programs directly with questions or concerns.\n\nGiven the unprecedented impact COVID-19 is having on peoples’ livelihoods, governments worldwide are taking measures to provide economic relief to individuals, families, and small businesses. Although not comprehensive, below is a list of potentially helpful government resources in the U.S.\n\nSummary: The U.S. has enacted two pieces of legislation - the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act - which include a wide variety of relief options, such as loans, grants, unemployment benefits, and deferred taxes for the self-employed, including independent contractors like you.\n\nAs a user of the TaskRabbit platform, you provide your services to your clients as an independent contractor. Furthermore, you are operating as a business entity — usually as a “sole proprietor.” Please find additional information in Sections 1 and 2 of TaskRabbit’s Terms of Service, as well as this Support Center article on Sole Proprietors.\n\n• Families First Coronavirus Response Act \"FFCRA\": Includes tax benefits for eligible small businesses (fewer than 500 employees) and a refundable tax credit provision for eligible independent contractors.\n\n• Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ‘‘CARES\": Includes a Federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program to provide compensation to eligible workers impacted by COVID-19, including self-employed independent contractors. Also includes the Small Business Administration’s new Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Emergency Grant Program.\n\nPandemic Unemployment Assistance: Self-employed individuals, including independent contractors, typically are not eligible for unemployment benefits, but the CARES Act for the first time broadens the eligibility guidelines to include Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) for independent workers. The program runs through December 31, 2020, and provides retroactive benefits from January 27, 2020. The U.S. Department of Labor issued guidance that expressly directs states to make PUA available to independent contractors and other self-employed individuals. The Unemployment Benefits Finder helps you learn how to file for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance in your state as an independent contractor. Note the current unprecedented demand may cause delays in application processing and receiving funds.\n\nAdditional resources\n\n• House Ways and Means CARES Act UI FAQ site\n\n• House Ways and Means CARES Act UI FAQ doc\n\n• Internal Revenue Service FAQs for Self-Employed Individuals\n\n• U.S. Department of Labor COVID-19 Resources\n\n• U.S. Department of Labor Unemployment Benefits Finder - Includes links and contact information for filing for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance in your state. Note that states are in the process of updating their websites to reflect these newly expanded benefits.\n\nSmall Business Assistance: There are two loan options available to self-employed individuals through the CARES Act: the Paycheck Protection Program, and the Economic Injury Disaster Loans and advances.\n\n• Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans: The new PPP loans are designed specifically to provide small businesses, including independent contractors and individuals operating as sole proprietors, with cash support. The PPP loans will be available through approved banks and credit unions, so consult with yours directly to see if they are participating in the program. Importantly, loan payments may be deferred and almost the entire amount of the PPP loan may be forgiven (no payback requirement) when applied toward qualifying expenses, which can be found here in the “Loan Details and Forgiveness” section. Additional resources:\n\n• U.S. Treasury CARES Small Business assistance\n\n• U.S. SBA District Office List\n\n• Treasury Department’s borrower fact sheet\n\n• Chamber of Commerce’s complete guide to the PPP\n\n• Chamber of Commerce’s PPP checklist\n\n• SBA PPP website\n\n• Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) and advances: EIDLs are low-interest, flat-rate loans that can be used to cover expenses like paid leave, payroll or lost revenue due to the pandemic. There is also an option to apply for an advance on the loan (which is being called a grant) of up to $10,000 which, when used on covered expenses, does not have to be paid back. Additional resources:\n\n• SBA EIDL Website\n\n• Chamber of Commerce step-by-step application guide\n\n• EIDL terms and conditions\n\n————————————————————————————————————\n\n“Self-employed individuals” as defined in 20 C.F.R 625.2(n) means individuals whose primary reliance for income is on the performance of services in the individual’s own business, or on the individual’s own farm. These individuals include independent contractors, including “gig economy” workers, and workers for certain religious entities.\n\nAdditional measures in the FFCRA and CARES Acts\n\n• Paid sick and family leave tax credit: The FFCRA entitles eligible self-employed individuals to an income tax credit to offset their federal self-employment tax for any taxable year equal to their “qualified sick leave equivalent amount” or “qualified family leave equivalent amount.” See IRS paid sick leave FAQs for the self-employed for additional information.\n\n• Tax filing deadline extensions: The IRS has moved the tax filing deadline for individuals and businesses from April 15 to July 15, 2020. Additional resources: IRS Filing and Payment FAQs and IRS Tax Resources (see the Tax Help section).\n\n• Payroll tax deferments: The CARES Act allows employers and self-employed individuals to delay certain types of payroll taxes. Specific requirements for tax filings are pending from the IRS. For more information, check the IRS coronavirus tax guidance page.\n\nState-level assistance: Note some states in the U.S. are offering additional assistance for the self-employed and small businesses including, for example, California and Illinois.

To ensure the fair treatment of Taskers and maintain a high level of service quality, we have the following cancellation policy:\n\nClients may cancel a task at any time. However, clients will be subject to a cancellation fee if either of the following are applicable:\n\nThe task was canceled by the client within 24 hours of the scheduled task time\n\nThe client is unavailable or unresponsive at the time of the task, so the task cannot be completed.\n\nThe Tasker also cannot have invoiced the client for the task. The task cannot have been canceled more than 30 days ago.\n\nClients will not be charged a cancellation fee if:\n\nThe cancellation was due to an IKEA delivery delay for an IKEA Assembly task,\n\nThe cancellation was due to the wrong task address provided through IKEA, or\n\nThe Tasker did not show up for the task.\n\nThe cancellation fee will be charged to the client's payment method associated with the task, and will be calculated as follows:\n\nThe equivalent of 1 hour at the Tasker's hourly rate and Taskrabbit fees, which cover platform usage.\n\nBy agreeing to use our platform and booking a Tasker, clients acknowledge their understanding and acceptance of this cancellation policy. It is the responsibility of the client to respond to their Tasker or Taskrabbit Support, and ensure their availability for the scheduled task.\n\nFor client cancellations meeting the criteria above, Taskers affected by these cancellations will be eligible to receive the equivalent of 1 hour of compensation at their hourly rate, in accordance with our company values, with one exception: Taskers with violations of the Taskrabbit Terms of Service in the past 90 days may be ineligible to receive compensation.\n\nIf a client refuses to pay the cancellation fee, their account may be suspended or deactivated, and they may be held responsible for any additional costs incurred by Taskrabbit or the Tasker due to the cancellation.\n\nTaskrabbit reserves the right to modify or update this policy at any time.",

Here’s what happened in my case:\n1.I had two Taskers assigned to a job, and neither finished the work on the same day. They promised to return the next day, but only one showed up. While the second Tasker managed to finish the job, TaskRabbit refused to pay him fairly for completing it.\n2.After rescheduling the task for another day, the new Tasker assigned wasn’t even available at the time I specifically requested. When the Tasker declined the task, TaskRabbit’s only response was to tell me to reschedule again instead of assigning someone reliable.\n\nThis app is completely unreliable, especially if you’re booking services like IKEA assembly or anything else.

Three times, I've scheduled cleaning services through their platform, and three times, I've been left scrambling at the last minute because the maid decided she had better things to do.\nIt's bad enough to have your plans thrown into disarray by a cancellation, but what's truly maddening is the complete lack of consequences for these flaky maids. They can bail on appointments with impunity, leaving customers like me in the lurch, and TaskRabbit doesn't bat an eyelash.\nAnd don't even get me started on TaskRabbit's customer service – or lack thereof. When I reached out for assistance after yet another cancellation, I was met with nothing but indifference and excuses. It's clear they have no interest in actually helping their customers or holding their so-called \"taskers\" accountable.\nTaskRabbit's motto should be \"We'll be there for you... until we're not.\" Save yourself the headache and steer clear of this sham of a service.

According to support, they do not bear any responsibility for the actions of the tasker.

They completely wash their hands of any responsibility after matching you with a Tasker. Here’s what happened in my case:\n1.I had two Taskers assigned to a job, and neither finished the work on the same day. They promised to return the next day, but only one showed up. While the second Tasker managed to finish the job, TaskRabbit refused to pay him fairly for completing it.\n2.After rescheduling the task for another day, the new Tasker assigned wasn’t even available at the time I specifically requested. When the Tasker declined the task, TaskRabbit’s only response was to tell me to reschedule again instead of assigning someone reliable.\n\nThis app is completely unreliable, especially if you’re booking services like IKEA assembly or anything else. TaskRabbit does nothing to support you when there’s an issue with their Taskers. The lack of accountability is shocking. I’m beyond dissatisfied and will never use this app again.

To be charged nearly $300 for a 10 minute task is so distasteful and the fact that Task Rabbit permits this is exploitative to customers to say the least. I’d have understood if I was charged for 1hrs worth of service (even that though that itself is far above the reality), but 2hrs? For a 10 minute job? The other tasker I booked cancelled on me last minute. The 2hr minimum was not written anywhere in the tasker’s profile and was sprung on me when the task had already been accepted and I needed the job done.

Have fun with thumbtack, where you pay for leads to jobs, even if the client doesn’t actually hire you. Or handy, where you don’t get to set your rates and get charged by handy for showing up 2 minutes late or for needing to reschedule, even in an emergency.\n\nTaskrabbit is deeply flawed, but even with this (small) fee change, they are still far and away the best service of this type with the most contractor freedom. Hopefully they quit shooting themselves in the foot with this app, but for now it’s still the best even if they don’t.\n\nAnd as others have said, the fee increase was only a few percentage points. Previously they added 15% to the Tasker rate as the listed rate the client saw, and then another 15% at the end on the final bill. And 1.15(1.15(TASKER RATE)=1.3225(TASKER RATE). So this new rate is only 3.05% higher (not 5.3% higher as the other poster said) than it was before, it’s mostly that it’s just presented differently. \n\nSounds like you just didn’t know how it worked before or you should have been angry this whole time.\n\n### Comment ID hjymphb with +2 score by [(alpha_seltzer, Reddit, 2021-11-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/qpuivi/best_alternatives/hjymphb/) (in reply to ID hjy7n80):\nHandy was the last one I haven't tried but it looks even worse than takl was. From a client POV, which OP is, the rate increase is worse than that, it went from 30% to 35%, or a 17% increase, with no value added to speak of. If a tasker sets their rate at $100, the client pays $135, with $35 going to the app for each and every hour of work, so it does appear to be a high fee. Even though TR makes more money in that example, it may be scaring clients off, especially since they made the fee more transparent in the hiring process. That may be why they are experimenting with hiding higher rate taskers from appearing in search results at all. Eventually, they will set hourly rate limits for taskers, even if this experiment is itself a de facto limit.\n\n#### Comment ID hjyn43o with +2 score by [(AnAmericanIndividual, Reddit, 2021-11-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/qpuivi/best_alternatives/hjyn43o/) (in reply to ID hjymphb):\nI just noticed that OP is a client so a lot of my post was irrelevant. Good catch.\n\nBut I’m sorry, you’re incorrect about the fee thing. Previously, if I the Tasker listed my rate at $100, the client would see $115 (100 x 1.15), and end up paying $132.25 (115 x 1.15) on the final bill. Now, if I list my rate at $100, the client sees $100, and pays $135.30 on the final bill. And .3225/.353 is only a 9% difference, not 17%. I agree that TR has added no value for that extra 9% fee, but that’s the nature of extractive middlemen and capitalism in general unfortunately.\n\nI do agree that TR is moving in the wrong direction and will eventually do everything they can to limit our rates.\n\n## Comment ID hjzuxsb with +3 score by [(geoffrey8, Reddit, 2021-11-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/qpuivi/best_alternatives/hjzuxsb/) (in reply to ID qpuivi):\nAlso regardless if there is an alternative.

Prior to the task, I sent him photos of what needed to be hung. The TaskRabbit didn’t drill a pilot hole or use a stud finder, and drilled a hole in the emergency sprinkler system pipe. This led to my apartment flooding and damages to 4 apartments below which I’m liable for. I have renters insurance, which will cover most damages, but I was stunned to discover that TR doesn’t require people to have insurance. \n\nAnd to add insult to injury, the guy said he wouldn’t bill me for the job, and then billed me for more hours than he worked. The charge was 5 hours for 2 shelves, 4 small pictures, and 2 small mirrors (less than 12in diameter). I had an additional charge for expenses which I didn’t authorize and have no idea what it could be. Maybe his shirt getting wet?\n\nI started a claim under hopes they would at least pay my deductible and TaskRabbit is claiming they won’t cover damages to the apartment AND that I need to provide an estimate of the damages addressed to me by the repair company within 7 days. There’s no way that estimates will be prepared in time. In addition, they’re bundling my claim due to the time theft / unauthorized expense with the damages claim. \n\nI’ll never use them again.

If you’re not okay with that or there is no compatible future date, then the Tasker is well within their rights to cancel, and should. Safety first.\n\nEvery Tasker has a different risk tolerance, vehicle, driving skills, etc, so it is impossible to answer your question about whether taskers often cancel for inclement weather. And it isn’t a particularly useful question to ask, since every weather event is also different so other ones will have no bearing on yours.\n\nIf Taskers cancel, they are pretty much always penalized regardless of how much notice there is (at least that’s how it appears, the system is opaque). But safety should come first so they still should if it’s truly unsafe to travel. To be honest, you’re giving off pretty bad client vibes.\n\nIf it’s truly a date-specific task and you’re concerned, try to get some other possible option in place as Plan B.

TR does not directly manage Taskers, and you can find plenty of evidence on here and elsewhere of unhappy customers due to late cancels and no-shows by Taskers.   \n\n\nThe best thing you can do is choose experienced taskers, with high ratings and reviews. That is the best path to high-confidence/trustworthy taskers.  Choosing taskers with low task count and low rates involves more risk.  In smaller, newer-to-TR metros, it may be hard, but being selective is essential.   \n\n\nAfter choosing an experienced tasker, you could share your concern about weather and reliability in the task chat, and confirm they have reliable transportation and are comfortable driving in moderately inclement weather for your location. Obviously, as surely you can understand, TR does support the notion of users -- both clients and taskers -- choose personal safety over tasking, if needed, so there's the simple reality that the weather may not cooperate with your plans.   \n\n\nGood luck!\n\n## Comment ID jbxhf04 with +2 score by [(Desperate_Ad_8065, Reddit, 2023-03-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/11p5fop/weatherrelated_cancelations/jbxhf04/) (in reply to ID 11p5fop):\nI Cancel Any Task I Don’t Wanna Do Or Not Worth My Time And My Profile Works Great.

Business is honestly better than ever for me. I get booked for virtually all of my availability and charge decent rates for my area.\n\nLast month I did 44 jobs, 80 hours, $3k(plus $2-300ish hundred cash/venmo tips). After drivetime and vehicle expenses thats just over $30/hr which is way better than I could do in my area without a degree or experience. Most I've ever made at a normal job was 22/hr but it was way more stressful.\n\nAlso I see so many people complain about the change to hiding fees in Tasker rate that started recently. Is it just me or is that actually great for most taskers? Like the total fees stayed the same at like 40% but now 1. clients aren't driven away thinking fees are higher 2. Percentage based tips mean you get higher tips since its based off of the Tasker rate with fees baked in(im not positive on this?) 3. When quoting off app its less jarring to the clients since fees are baked in. If I'm getting 30 and client see 36 and I qoute 40 off app that seems reasonable, if I'm getting 30 and client sees 32 and I qoute 40 its gonna seem like a big jump for some.\n\n## Comment ID kpfi8ll with +17 score by [(KithMeImTyson, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1alka6v/anyone_else_actually_doing_great_on_taskrabbit/kpfi8ll/) (in reply to ID 1alka6v):\nSo is this the newest crackpot marketing campaign that TR has unveiled, or what?

Is your city’s airport a hub? Likely not. Metro rank is likely not top 25. \n\nNY, LA, SF: account for as much as 50% of TR US activity. \n\nThese metros and the others in the top 10 have significantly different dynamics in play than what is a smaller metro for TR, as you describe. \n\nSearch FA in your city and sort by Completed task count. Get the count of taskers over 500 tasks. Then search LA, SF, NY, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle. There’s a significant difference, right?\n\nTo be clear, that doesn’t mean your experience is not valid, isn’t true, or doesn’t matter. All it means is, the city and the categories matter and comparisons between them aren’t always very meaningful or useful. Your experience doesn’t explain the experience in NYC, and their experience doesn’t explain yours. That’s the key point. \n\nThere have definitely been significant changes in how the platform operates over the years. This can be true, and not have any significant impact on a smaller metro, because… those changes are insignificant in a metro with less than 30 taskers available for FA. NY likely has that many that are Elite and more than 10x that available.\n\n### Comment ID kpkdqf0 with +1 score by [(PraiseTalos66012, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1alka6v/anyone_else_actually_doing_great_on_taskrabbit/kpkdqf0/) (in reply to ID kphxehz):\n\"Get the count of taskers over 500 tasks\"\nI'm surprised there was any honestly but we have a whole 2 taskers over 500.\n\nHonestly I thought my metro was alot bigger than it is, I had only ever looked up where the city ranks in population not the metro.

As with any marketplace, there is a wide range of providers. Individual experiences vary widely. So whether or not it meets your judgment of ‘good’, depends on your expectations of a ‘worker’, how many are available in your area to choose from and who you hire. \n\nTR’s fees currently range from 42-49% markup to the rate the tasker sets, some included in the hourly rate you see, some in a separate Trust and Support fee you won’t see until you get to the Confirmation screen in the booking process. They are charged as a percentage per hour, so be aware of that.any clients don’t catch on to this. \n\nTaskRabbit does criminal background checks, but that’s it. No skill testing, etc. So how good the tasker will be varies widely. \n\nConceptually, it’s great. In today’s actual execution…\nIt varies widely. \n\nChoose your tasker carefully and communicate clearly and thoroughly.

Once you start getting good reviews and a lot more tasks under your belt, it can be pretty lucrative, depending where you live.  TR I think is a gig app that is really close to actually being an independent contractor, unlike rideshare or the food apps.\n\nYou set your rates, you set the area you want to work.  You know exactly what the tasks entails and how long it should take.  There will be clients that mess this up, but for the most part, it's pretty straight forward as long as you have good communication skills and keep the client on the same page.\n\nI did just moving tasks for years, and it was super easy for me to get tasks every weekend without doing anything but being available.  I charged $60/hour, and that was for me.  The client paid 15% above that, or whatever TR additional cut was.  And my rate wasn't even super expensive.  I know a bunch of taskers that were charging north of $80/hour and getting tons of tasks.  It was pretty easy for me to make a couple hundred dollars every weekend if I pushed it.  Now think if you did this full time and charged more because you have the reviews to?  You could easily make this your full time job and make some good money, if you're in a market that TR is popular.\n\nFurniture assembly is also very popular.  So if you can do that and/or moving/heavy lifting, there is some pretty good money to be made.\n\nIf you wanted to try, now would be a good time.  Once spring comes around and into summer, clients love having taskers do stuff.  Moving is super hot category in the summer.  But remember, like starting anything new, it starts out slow.  Don't expect to sign up and instantly get tons of tasks.  You need those reviews to build your \"street cred\"\n\n## Comment ID i4ocjge with +3 score by [(DylanS89, Reddit, 2022-04-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/txsvfh/just_learned_of_task_rabbit_how_is_it_from_a/i4ocjge/) (in reply to ID txsvfh):\nI have a friend who clean for a living ahe started with handy pro(which i dont recommend for cleaning) but she was getting paid terrible money for big jobs but there were some clients she form a relationship with because of her work and end up getting repeatedly clients.

It’s not bad.  You can get hired for just about anything really.  So there’s a wide range of opportunities.\n\nI have next to know real skills and I still get hired at least several times a month.  I usually make anywhere from $200 - $400 in a months time and I don’t really make myself that available because sometimes I’m too busy to even go out tasking.\n\nYou set your own rates, set your work area, what you want to do, when you are available to work, and then wait to get hired.  You might not get any work for that day, or you might get 2 or 3 jobs.  Sometimes I’ll get 2 in one day.  I think I did 3 in one day just once.  Sometimes, it’s hit or miss, but what you want is repeat clients.  That’s where your predictable and regular income comes from.\n\nOn that guy making $400 for the bike dissemble, it’s entirely possible.  You can have your rate maxed out and then charge a 2 hour minimum, then plus a tip, yeah $400 for that job is possible.\n\nPretty much earn as much as you can.  I’d say if you have some real life handy skills, you can probably make much more.  I’ve read some people have made over 100K in a year just working as a Tasker.  I think to reach that, you need to do a lot of tasks and make it your full time gig for sure.  I just don’t have the skills to rely solely on TaskRabbit, but I’m satisfied with where I’m at and I hope it gets better from here!\n\nAlso, where you’re located will matter as well.

It's got pros and cons.\n\nThe pros are that you can make your own schedule and set your own rates. The cons are that people tend to lie or greatly understate the extent of their tasks. For example, I've had several IKEA assemblies where the client stated that they had 1x or whatever assembly it is. Show up to the job only to find out that it's a totally different assembly altogether, or the item they said they had one of is actually 10.\n\nOne huge downside of TR is that someone can hire you for a job and then be a complete no-show and you just have to eat that time and gas. They say that you may qualify for a cancellation fee but they always seem to have a slick reason  for why you don't.\n\n## Comment ID jjkrpjm with +2 score by [(Silly_Slice_4119, Reddit, 2023-05-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/txsvfh/just_learned_of_task_rabbit_how_is_it_from_a/jjkrpjm/) (in reply to ID txsvfh):\nThey gather all your information first and waste your time before telling you about the fee.

They can bail on appointments with impunity, leaving customers like me in the lurch, and TaskRabbit doesn't bat an eyelash.\nAnd don't even get me started on TaskRabbit's customer service – or lack thereof. When I reached out for assistance after yet another cancellation, I was met with nothing but indifference and excuses. It's clear they have no interest in actually helping their customers or holding their so-called \"taskers\" accountable.\nTaskRabbit's motto should be \"We'll be there for you... until we're not.\" Save yourself the headache and steer clear of this sham of a service.

While the second Tasker managed to finish the job, TaskRabbit refused to pay him fairly for completing it.\n2.After rescheduling the task for another day, the new Tasker assigned wasn’t even available at the time I specifically requested. When the Tasker declined the task, TaskRabbit’s only response was to tell me to reschedule again instead of assigning someone reliable.\n\nThis app is completely unreliable, especially if you’re booking services like IKEA assembly or anything else. TaskRabbit does nothing to support you when there’s an issue with their Taskers. The lack of accountability is shocking. I’m beyond dissatisfied and will never use this app again.

I’d have understood if I was charged for 1hrs worth of service (even that though that itself is far above the reality), but 2hrs? For a 10 minute job? The other tasker I booked cancelled on me last minute. The 2hr minimum was not written anywhere in the tasker’s profile and was sprung on me when the task had already been accepted and I needed the job done. I could not use this to make a decision when booking the task. Such a poor experience from a customer’s perspective and I feel taken advantage of. I proceeded to delete the app as I do not plan to use this service moving forward. \n(Customer service was useless in supporting me with this issue.

The film was applied with many bubbles and my boyfriend helped him apply it and the service man didn’t even bother cleaning the window before applying the film ! Not as bad as the service man who took 3 days to put up blinds and milked us for over 8 hours of work daily! I’ll find a more reliable app that has replicable services available at better or fairer prices. Also Taskrabbit never returned my email for help asking for the service fee and why it was applied every hour instead of a flat fee them getting a cut of over $50 for a service fee, for every service is bull if you ask me. I thank god nothing went terrible on the tasks because the horror stories of taskers ruining peoples home and Taskrabbit saying they cannot help is bull also so what’s with that dumb fee?!???

So I decided to give them a try again. Now a new problem: There is no way to message the tasker before booking them. Really? THe last tasker claimed to be able to work on routers. He was not. But a few questions could have screened him successfully. So I am guessing some taskers were trying to circumvent the system- and there is no way to screen them successfully from providing their contact info. This is basically unachievable. But that breaks the ability to screen the wrong taskers and I just can't take the chance.",

Also, as a person who just enjoys doing task of all kinds and just by looking over the app itself I would highly recommend it to anyone that needs to make a little extra money or even would like to help others that may not have the knowledge or skills that other folks have gain knowledge in over there years of living.

They have turned a once good platform into utter garbage (go check out their hundreds of complaints with the BBB). Very few Taskers can make a living on the platform anymore and many of the best have left because of the changes. That is creating a negative feedback loop. \n\nThe culture seems great at first until the realization hits that only the favorites get promoted despite failing to meet their objectives. They then blame others who bear the brunt of the failure despite it not being their fault. Some of the people are turning straight evil trying to make things work and it is truly sad. Most people just don't really care and don't have to as long as they don't get blamed for anything. There is no career growth whatsoever even though they put on a really good show that they care and there are opportunities. Most people just make a few lateral moves before giving up.",

She struggles to connect with the majority of Taskrabbit's employees (she is self-serving) and faces challenges in retaining members of the leadership team. Furthermore, she continues to appoint incompetent leaders who align with her ineffective approach and accommodate her working style. Consequently, the company's culture has become toxic and excessively political, which is disproportionate to its size. \n\nDespite the company achieving record numbers, largely attributable to the hard work of its employees, there is a strong belief that these numbers could be even higher with a different CEO at the helm. However, from an external perspective, there appears to be no immediate reason to demand a change in leadership. I hope that the board or individuals from IKEA, as stakeholders, will conduct a thorough assessment of Ania's impact on the company.",

Consequently, the company's culture has become toxic and excessively political, which is disproportionate to its size. \n\nDespite the company achieving record numbers, largely attributable to the hard work of its employees, there is a strong belief that these numbers could be even higher with a different CEO at the helm.

      "# [Tasker Stories: An Unlikely Friendship by TaskRabbit on 2022-11-13](https://www.taskrabbit.com/blog/tasker-stories-an-unlikely-friendship)\nSometimes, crossing an item off your to-do list can result in the most unexpected connections. For Tasker Christian B., a simple task for an elderly woman in San Francisco has turned into a remarkable friendship.\n\n“From 2008 to 2014, I co-owned and ran a residential care facility for the elderly, specializing in people with Alzheimer’s Disease and Dementia. I was at the facility 24/7 with my two other staff members before eventually deciding to sell it. When I heard about Taskrabbit, I got interested because I already had experience with building stuff. I used to leave my business card at IKEA to deliver and put together furniture back, and had all the tools & experience from my remodeling my carehome. I signed up and my first task was on Thanksgiving for a family that needed help fixing several things at their grandma’s place. It just catapulted from there.\n\nI’ve met many generous people through Taskrabbit, but Janet turned out to be the most amazing client. In Janet, I not only found friendship—I found family. My partner and I ended up taking care of her home in San Francisco, which led to us taking care of her. We now live with her rent-free. Janet became a mother to us, a confidant, a laughing buddy. She leans on us as much as we lean on her. When people see the real you and trust you with their lives, you know that’s true friendship and that it’s worth keeping. And overall, life is better now. It has given us a positive outlook on life; we laugh every day; we treasure every moment.\n\nLast November, Janet was in the ER for two months. My partner and I knew she wanted to live, so we fought for her by staying by her side the whole time, doing everything we could to help the doctors and nurses save her life. We were at her bedside 24/7. Later, her family and doctors told us that we literally saved her life. It was a life-changing moment. Because we took the time to focus on what we promised to do for her, we succeeded in getting her back home, healthier than when we met her. We had a lot of sacrifices, but it was all worth it, because we deeply cared.”",
      "# [Taskrabbit CEO Talks About The Evolution Of Gig Economy Companies by Megan Poinski on 2024-04-07](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/04/07/taskrabbit-ceo-talks-about-the-evolution-of-gig-economy-companies/)\nThis is the published version of Forbes’ CEO newsletter, which offers the latest news for today's and tomorrow's business leaders and decision makers. Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every Sunday.\n\nDisney’s current leadership made some magic happen last week, though not the kind usually linked to the company. At its annual shareholders meeting, Disney was able to ward off pushes to elect new board members from two activist investor groups—Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management and Blackwells Capital—and maintain its existing slate of 12 board members.\n\nThe hedge funds each put forward slates of nominees who pledged to take Disney down a new path. Trian was looking for Disney to address recent declines in its earnings, while Blackwells was interested in breaking the mega-company into three smaller entities: sports, entertainment and experiences. And while these both represent valid paths forward for Disney, many observers predicted the rebuffing the activist investors received. After all, Disney’s share price rebounded more than 45% during the last six months following the reinstatement of CEO Bob Iger, delivering strong quarterly results and a cost-cutting plan. An optimistic analyst note from UBS last week also projected the company’s streaming services will break even this year and be a significant source of future revenue.\n\nAlthough Disney won this round, activist investors and proxy wars aren’t going away. Trian had mounted a similar campaign against Disney’s leadership last year, with Peltz throwing in the towel after saying Disney had done what the firm wanted, and placing faith in Iger’s then-recent return to the CEO position. From Disney’s perspective, the company was fortunate this time because Iger’s business moves were beginning to bear fruit in the run-up to the shareholder meeting, as well as the opportune timing of the optimistic analyst’s note.\n\nHowever, it can be argued that even though Trian didn’t win any spots on Disney’s board, the firm got what it wanted, which is the whole point of an activist investor campaign. In a statement issued after the meeting, Trian said they were disappointed with the election results, but “proud of the impact we have had in refocusing this Company on value creation and good governance. Since we re-engaged with the Company in late 2023, Disney has announced a host of new operating initiatives and capital improvement plans.”\n\nSprawling mega-companies like Disney represent one portion of the business landscape, but different businesses have vastly different models. Marketplace companies built on individual contractors renting their skills, homes or goods are also a powerful force today. Taskrabbit CEO Ania Smith, who previously held high-level jobs at marketplace giants Uber and Airbnb, talked to me about the evolution of that space. An excerpt from our interview is later in this newsletter.\n\nHUMAN CAPITAL\n\nLast week had both good and bad news for workers. The good news: The U.S. added more jobs than expected in March—a grand total of 303,000, according to a report from the U.S. Labor Department. This moved the unemployment rate to 3.8%, extending the longest streak of unemployment below 4% since the 1960s, and beat analysts’ predictions of the number of jobs added. Hourly earnings also rose 4.1% from March 2023 to last month, keeping ahead of inflation and matching analysts’ projections.\n\nEven though so many jobs were added, March was the worst month for layoffs since January 2023. U.S. employers cut 90,309 jobs last month, according to a report from outplacement and career services firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas. More than a third were federal government job cuts in the U.S. Army and Veterans Affairs department. More than 250,000 total jobs were eliminated in the first quarter of 2024, with the tech sector seeing the deepest cuts, losing 42,442 jobs.\n\nWhat does this mean? Although job cuts are increasing, job growth is also red hot—and outpacing the losses. In Challenger, Gray and Christmas’s analysis, the largest number of layoffs was attributed to cost-cutting. As many businesses and investors are optimistic about growth through eventual interest rate cuts and new initiatives made possible by technology and AI, perhaps the need to cut costs will slow down.\n\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n\nGenerative AI has the potential to add capabilities to a wide range of industries, but developments in medicine and health care were on full display last week. The FDA cleared two AI-powered tools for clinical use: An algorithm developed by the Mayo Clinic and digital stethoscope maker Eko Health that can detect the heart ineffectively pumping blood—an early sign of heart disease—and a software tool that can use data to detect sepsis developed by AI company Prenosis. Those who developed the Eko Health algorithm told Forbes’ Alex Knapp that these applications can significantly affect patient outcomes. “These tools are incredibly powerful — they help us screen for conditions for which we have treatments,” said Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Chair Paul Friedman.\n\nIn general, many business AI applications involve intelligent chatbots, and a study published last week showed they can also be helpful in a healthcare setting. A Northwestern Medicine study in JAMA Network found ChatGPT was able to respond to questions about radiation oncology as well or better than trained professionals. The AI system was asked 115 common questions about radiation therapy or chemotherapy, and its answers were scored by three radiation oncologists and three radiation physicists. The only concern with the AI-generated responses flagged by the study was that some used complex medical jargon and may be difficult to understand. The study said this is an early indicator that AI could be a first line for patient information about cancer treatment—and help reduce workloads and burnout rates for physicians specializing in the disease.\n\nNOTABLE NEWS\n\nProgress toward gender equality in the C-suite has fallen for the first time in two decades, according to a report published last month by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The firm, which has tracked women’s representation in C-suite positions since 2005, found 11.8% of these jobs were held by women in 2023. This is down from 12.2% in 2022, and represents the first time there has been a decrease in this metric. One of the reasons may be less corporate emphasis on gender diversity. S&P looked at mentions of the issue in earnings calls, and found 2023 had the least mentions of the issue since 2012. Forbes contributor Soulaima Gourani writes this study should be a wake-up call for organizations to reassess their commitment to gender diversity, since diverse leadership teams are proven to bring greater creativity, resilience and financial performance.\n\nTOMORROW’S TRENDS\n\nTaskrabbit CEO Ania Smith On The Evolution Of Marketplace Companies\n\nAnia Smith built her career in diverse businesses. She’s held senior positions at companies with traditional employees, including Expedia and Walmart, and nine years ago made a switch to marketplace businesses, where the service employees are gig workers. She worked with Airbnb and Uber before becoming Taskrabbit’s CEO in August 2020. I talked to her about her work with marketplace companies and how today’s economy has impacted the business. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.\n\nWhy have you wanted to keep working with marketplace companies?\n\nSmith: I didn’t wake up one day and go, ‘Oh, I want to go work in the gig economy space.’ What I did think about is I love travel as an industry, and so when I got a call from Airbnb, I thought, oh yes, I want to go back to travel because it's an amazing space to be in. Fairly quickly I realized…what made Airbnb so much different is the gig economy piece of it, meaning all of our hosts who were just everyday people looking to rent out their space. My role was to help to work with our hosts, and that became extremely motivating, because I started thinking not only about why they come and what motivates them to come to our site.\n\nWhether it’s for Airbnb, or couriers at Uber Eats, or taskers here at Taskrabbit, what I started thinking a lot about is how incredible it is that we live in an era where this is normal. Where 60 to 70 million people are doing some sort of side gig, and how I wish that these types of platforms would have existed two or three decades ago because I immigrated here from Poland, and my parents had to work a lot to make ends meet in traditional roles. You have to then deal with schedules, and you never could get enough hours. …It was just very hard, especially while they were raising two young kids. It would have been great to have any of these platforms available then, so they could use that opportunity to make that extra, meaningful income in a way that allowed them to do that with flexibility and with autonomy and with allowing them to figure out what their pricing is.\n\nI meet taskers all day, every day, and it’s really motivating to understand the impact that we're having on their lives. We just met with some taskers last week. This tasker’s a firefighter, but has really decided to lean in on TV mounting and some other skills, and she is really happy with the ability to make that extra income while she has her other job.\n\nYou’ve been at the helm of Taskrabbit through the Covid-19 pandemic, the great resignation and high inflation. Through all of that, how have things changed?\n\nAll this is happening quite fast, and more and more people are searching for that flexibility and autonomy, which means our tasker population has continued to grow at really high rates. For the first time, we have to start thinking about [whether there] are perhaps too many taskers in a metro area. …We’ve been focused on trying to manage both sides of the marketplace so that as we have more taskers coming on board who want to help, we also want to have as many new customers come on board who need that help. Because at the end of the day, that’s the crux of managing the marketplace.\n\nIt is very quantitative and very analytical, and there are many things that we can do as a company that helps to optimize both the demand and the supply side of the business. We do that by thinking a lot about locations: Do we have enough taskers in certain zip codes? Or maybe we do have enough taskers, but they all know how to do cleaning or yard work, and not enough of them know how to assemble furniture. So maybe perhaps we need to go out and tell our story more and make sure that we get more taskers who can assemble furniture. Or maybe in another location. …There’s also pricing and timing and so on.\n\nWe do that every day, and use a lot of machine learning and a lot of smart technologies to help us to think about how to optimize the marketplace so that it’s the best experience for both our taskers and our clients. Because at the end of the day, what we don’t want is our clients coming to our app and looking for someone to help them with yard work, and seeing that there is no one there who can do it. Or maybe there are people who can do it, but not for another two weeks. At the same time, we don’t want taskers signing up and just waiting for jobs and not getting any. They count on us to make that income.\n\nHow has public perception and use of marketplace companies changed in the nine years you’ve been involved with them?\n\nWhen these companies were launching, it was so new and took a lot of money and a lot of financing from venture funds to build the market, because it didn’t quite exist. And then we went through this whole phase of Uber for everything. I think over time, the acceptance has grown as customers have realized the ease and the convenience of using some of these services. On the supply side, hosts and drivers and couriers and taskers have really learned to lean in and use these platforms to help them…to feel a lot more independent.\n\nThen the pandemic hit, and I think that just turbo-charged the entire business. It was explosive growth for all of these main platforms for a variety of reasons. How we really evolved our thinking on travel and what we wanted to do, how we evolved thinking about delivery, and how we evolved thinking about having more flexibility. How we think about our time today is very different. It’s become more precious and people, I think, are more open to outsourcing some tasks that allow them to have more time to spend with their families, or spend on their hobbies. I think this area is only going to continue to grow.\n\nFACTS + COMMENTS\n\nTesla is scrapping plans to build low-cost electric vehicles, Reuters reported Friday, and instead plans to put more resources into creating robotaxis.

      "# [I'm a retiree who assembles furniture on Taskrabbit to avoid draining my retirement fund. At 79, I also like having structure and meeting new people. by Perri Ormont Blumberg on 2024-12-16](https://www.businessinsider.com/supplement-retirement-savings-doing-tasks-taskrabbit-retiree-2024-12)\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dan Weiss, a 79-year-old Tasker on Taskrabbit in Oakdale, Minnesota. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI joined Taskrabbit in 2021 and have completed nearly 1,200 tasks at around $47 per hour for my services in Ikea furniture and general furniture assembly in and around Minneapolis.\n\nI have a bachelor's degree in business administration and management and two master's degrees. Before I retired in November 2014, I managed several residential mortgage branches for a major bank.\n\nRetirement was fine initially, but I quickly realized I needed to add structure to my life. Now, I fill my days building furniture, meeting new people, and supplementing my retirement income.\n\nGoing from 100 mph to 0 was a very abrupt change for me\n\nOne can only do so much gardening and reading without feeling unfulfilled.\n\nI stayed \"retired\" for about six months and then had to find something that gave me more enjoyment and provided additional income to avoid chipping away at all of my retirement savings, which I began saving for in my mid-40s.\n\nBefore Taskrabbit, my other part-time jobs included stints at Costco, customer-service work, and driving for Uber and Lyft.\n\nI read an article in my local newspaper about a young woman who had discovered Taskrabbit. It intrigued me, so I immediately went online to create a Tasker account and have them run a background check on me. That was completed in a matter of days, and I was ready to go.\n\nRelated stories\n\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nI've now been Tasking for 3 years\n\nI've always enjoyed assembling things, but there was a learning curve. Although I had previously worked with Ikea furniture, there was much to figure out about some of the \"tricks\" associated with Ikea products.\n\nI made over $47,000 in 2023, my highest year in earnings yet. I average $3,000 to $5,000 in earnings monthly. I could live on my retirement savings if I had to, but my Taskrabbit income helps.\n\nI do tasks almost daily\n\nI complete one to three tasks daily, averaging about four to five days a week. Most of my tasks are no more than a half hour away, but I spend a fair amount of time driving. I can expense the mileage and gas.\n\nMy time spent with clients is highly enjoyable. I meet people from all walks of life and find their stories interesting. I enjoy this aspect of tasking the most.\n\nI've realized how fulfilling and also challenging retirement can be\n\nThe lack of structure and income flow in retirement is challenging. We're told to save, save, save for retirement, and that's what I did. When I made the change from saving to spending, I was mind-blown. It didn't feel comfortable or natural.\n\nTaskrabbit has allowed me to continue to generate income while also providing structure and allowing me to maintain contact with a variety of people.\n\nI've discovered the importance of superb reviews in growing my business\n\nWhen I was young, there were no such things as digital reviews. Today, they're critical because everyone checks them before booking a service or going to a restaurant. I secure generally excellent reviews by doing the following steps:\n\nAlways communicate openly with your client. Confirm the date and time and set expectations in advance.\n\nArrive on time or slightly early. If you will be late, even by a few minutes, it's important to let them know.\n\nUpon arriving, be friendly and cordial. A handshake usually gets things off to a good start to establish a line of trust.\n\nBe efficient and ensure the task is completed properly and precisely. Having the correct tools is also mandatory for this aspect of the task.\n\nIf there are problems such as missing or defective parts, let the client know as soon as possible and provide suggestions on how to remedy the problem so as not to add stress to their plate.\n\nThank them for the work opportunity and share how they can save you as a favorite for future tasks, leave a review, and, if they choose, tip you, which happens about 25% to 40% of the time. I'm very focused during the actual task, but if the client engages me in conversation or has questions, I stop and focus on them.\n\nI expect to continue to task as long as the compensation is commensurate with the job\n\nI will continue to do this as long as my body holds up.\n\nTasking has given me both fulfillment and help funding trips and vacations. My wife and I love Maui and intend to return soon.\n\nI'm still in the planning phase of deciding on our next vacation destination. There are many other places that we wish to visit while we're still healthy and relatively mobile.\n\nAre you a retiree with a side hustle who wants to share your story?

      "# [Ikea integrates Taskrabbit booking service into checkout by Tatiana Walk-Morris, Daphne Howland on 2025-02-19](https://www.retaildive.com/news/ikea-streamlines-taskrabbit-furniture-assembly-service-checkout/740315/)\nThis audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.\n\nDive Brief:\n\nTo further assist with customers’ assembly needs, Ikea has expanded its partnership with Taskrabbit, according to a Thursday press release.\n\nShoppers can now book and pay for a Taskrabbit contractor to assemble their furniture while finalizing their Ikea purchases. In the past, Ikea customers had to book Taskrabbit assembly separately.\n\nThe integration is available at Ikea locations in the U.S., the U.K., Canada and Spain, according to the announcement.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nIntegrating Taksrabbit’s services into the Ikea checkout process helps streamline the experience for customers and builds on a yearslong partnership between the two companies.\n\nIkea’s parent company, Ingka Holding BV and its controlled entities bought the gig work platform in 2017. The following year, the company debuted its TaskRabbit At-Home Assembly service at six of its Ikea stores before expanding it further.\n\nSo far, adding Taskrabbit to its checkout has yielded sizable returns for Ikea. Taskrabbit noted that the share of shoppers buying assembly services through the new booking experience has increased by 50% compared to before, according to Thursday’s announcement. Plus, returns have fallen 40%, and the average order value has spiked nearly five-fold since adding the service at checkout, Taskrabbit said.\n\n“Taskrabbit’s assembly service has been a game-changer for our customers, offering them convenience and reliability, two must-haves when shopping at Ikea,” Javier Quiñones, CEO of Ikea U.S., said in a statement. “This integration also provides Ikea with a competitive advantage — we’ve seen improved customer satisfaction and increased sales as customers include assembly with their furniture purchase.”",

The platform has seen significant enhancements, particularly through its partnership with IKEA. Recently, IKEA integrated Taskrabbit's booking service into its checkout process, allowing customers to book assembly services while finalizing their furniture purchases. This integration has reportedly increased the share of shoppers purchasing assembly services by 50% and reduced returns by 40% [(Walk-Morris & Howland, Retail Dive, 2025)](https://www.retaildive.com/news/ikea-streamlines-taskrabbit-furniture-assembly-service-checkout/740315/).\n\n## User Experience and Testimonials\n\nTaskers on the platform have shared positive experiences, highlighting the flexibility and income opportunities that Taskrabbit provides.

Smith noted that the pandemic \"turbo-charged the entire business,\" leading to explosive growth as people sought more flexible work arrangements [(Poinski, Forbes, 2024)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/04/07/taskrabbit-ceo-talks-about-the-evolution-of-gig-economy-companies/).\n\n## Financial Performance and Future Outlook\n\nWhile specific revenue figures for Taskrabbit are not publicly disclosed, the integration with IKEA and the growing demand for gig services suggest a positive trajectory for the company. The partnership has not only improved customer satisfaction but also increased sales, indicating a strong market position [(Walk-Morris & Howland, Retail Dive, 2025)](https://www.retaildive.com/news/ikea-streamlines-taskrabbit-furniture-assembly-service-checkout/740315/).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTaskrabbit stands out as a significant player in the gig economy, leveraging its partnership with IKEA to enhance its service offerings and streamline user experiences. With a strong leadership team and a growing user base, Taskrabbit is well-positioned for continued growth in the evolving marketplace landscape.
