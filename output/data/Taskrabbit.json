  "summary_markdown": "# About Taskrabbit\n\nTaskrabbit is a marketplace platform that connects individuals needing assistance with local \"Taskers\" who provide various services. Founded in 2008 by Leah Solivan, Taskrabbit has grown significantly and was acquired by IKEA in 2017. The acquisition has allowed Taskrabbit to expand its reach and integrate its services with IKEA's offerings [(Hays, Taskrabbit, 2024)](https://www.taskrabbit.com/blog/2024-trend-report). Taskrabbit operates in over 75 cities across eight countries, including Canada, France, Monaco, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and is available in over 200 IKEA stores worldwide [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/taskrabbit).\n\nTaskrabbit's primary product is its online platform, which facilitates connections between clients and Taskers for a wide range of services, such as handyman work, moving assistance, furniture assembly, cleaning, and lawn care. The platform is designed to be user-friendly, allowing clients to book services through the website or app, with options for same-day service availability in many locations [(Taskrabbit Competitors: 8 Alternatives for Lead Generation, 2024)](https://www.servicetitan.com/blog/taskrabbit-competitors).\n\nTaskrabbit serves a diverse customer base, primarily individuals and families looking for help with everyday tasks. The company operates on a B2C model, generating revenue through service fees charged to clients and Taskers. As of 2024, Taskrabbit's revenue ranges from $50 million to $100 million, indicating a stable financial position within the gig economy sector [(Taskrabbit Company Overview, 2024)](https://leadiq.com/c/taskrabbit/5a1d8819240000240061e8f8).\n\nTaskrabbit has adapted its operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by promoting contactless and virtual task options to ensure safety and compliance with public health guidelines. The company also provides resources for Taskers regarding financial assistance programs available during the pandemic [(TaskRabbit Overview, 2024)](https://www.taskrabbit.com/).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\n### Leah Solivan\nLeah Solivan is the founder of Taskrabbit and played a crucial role in its development. Her background as an engineer and her understanding of technology have been instrumental in shaping Taskrabbit's platform and its approach to the gig economy. Solivan has emphasized the importance of flexibility and autonomy in the gig economy [(Smith, Forbes, 2024)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/04/07/taskrabbit-ceo-talks-about-the-evolution-of-gig-economy-companies/).\n\n### Ania Smith\nAnia Smith is the current CEO of Taskrabbit. She has a background in marketplace companies, having held senior positions at Uber and Airbnb. Smith focuses on optimizing the marketplace by using data analytics and machine learning to balance supply and demand effectively [(Smith, Forbes, 2024)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/04/07/taskrabbit-ceo-talks-about-the-evolution-of-gig-economy-companies/).\n\n# News\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### Acquisition of Dolly\nIn November 2024, Taskrabbit acquired the on-demand moving service Dolly, marking a significant expansion in its service offerings and market reach [(Taylor Soper, Geekwire, 2024)](https://www.geekwire.com/2024/taskrabbit-quietly-acquired-on-demand-moving-service-dolly/).\n\n### Partnerships\nTaskrabbit has partnered with various companies, including IKEA, Arcade1Up, Robinhood, and Capri Sun, to expand its service offerings and market reach [(Taskrabbit Company Overview, 2024)](https://leadiq.com/c/taskrabbit/5a1d8819240000240061e8f8). In September 2024, Taskrabbit partnered with Cachet, further enhancing its strategic collaborations [(Avi Ben-Hutta, Coverager, 2024)](https://coverager.com/cachet-partners-with-taskrabbit/).\n\n## User Experiences and Feedback\n\nUser experiences on Taskrabbit are mixed. Some users praise the platform for its convenience and flexibility, while others express frustration with customer service and tasker reliability. For example, Dan Weiss, a 79-year-old Tasker, enjoys the structure and social interaction that Taskrabbit provides, earning between $3,000 to $5,000 monthly [(Blumberg, Business Insider, 2024)](https://www.businessinsider.com/supplement-retirement-savings-doing-tasks-taskrabbit-retiree-2024-12). However, there are complaints regarding tasker performance and customer service responsiveness, indicating areas for improvement [(Taskrabbit Reviews, 2019)](https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/taskrabbit.com).\n\n## Cultural and Aesthetic Trends\n\nTaskrabbit has identified several emerging home aesthetic trends based on user data, such as Gardencore, Craftcore, Hostingcore, Sportscore, Westerncore, Techcore, and Colorcore. These trends reflect changing consumer preferences and have influenced the types of services requested on the platform [(Hays, Taskrabbit, 2024)](https://www.taskrabbit.com/blog/2024-trend-report).\n\n## Investment Activity\n\nMucker Capital recently invested in Taskrabbit, showcasing external confidence in the company's growth prospects. This investment highlights potential avenues for sales by targeting businesses within Mucker Capital's portfolio or network [(Taskrabbit Company Overview, 2024)](https://leadiq.com/c/taskrabbit/5a1d8819240000240061e8f8).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nTaskrabbit remains a significant player in the gig economy, leveraging its platform to connect clients with Taskers for a variety of services. The company's focus on emerging home aesthetic trends, strategic partnerships, and investment activity positions it well for future growth. However, addressing user feedback and enhancing customer service will be crucial for maintaining its reputation and ensuring long-term success.",

      "# [About TaskRabbit: Who We Are and How We Got Here.](https://www.taskrabbit.com/announcements)\nAs restrictions are lifted across regions and cities, we ask the TaskRabbit community to remain mindful of all public health guidance and regulations in your area, especially since they may change from one day to the next. If your area allows in-person contact, please feel free to book these tasks. However, if a task can be done in a contactless or virtual way, we encourage taking these precautions.\n\nA contactless task is one that maintains social distancing of at least 6 feet/2 meters from another person. For example, you can request your Tasker perform the task outside, in a separate room, or offsite (e.g. leaving a delivery at your door). Instructions for contactless tasks can be indicated in the booking details and/or via task chat.\n\nYou may also request that a task be done virtually via chat, a call, or video. For example, you can have a Tasker complete data entry or personal assistant work virtually or guide you through a furniture assembly via a video call. Just let your Tasker know in your task description how you’d like to complete the task virtually.\n\nIf you are experiencing symptoms of illness, please let your Tasker know. Both you and your Tasker should take appropriate precautions to perform the task in a contactless or virtual way.\n\nThese are uncertain and confusing times and we want to do what we can to provide you with information to help you and your business get through it. The information below is our effort to share recent financial assistance programs that may be of interest to you as an independent contractor and user of the TaskRabbit platform. TaskRabbit is, of course, not affiliated with the financial assistance programs listed here, and cannot advise on program eligibility or how to apply for any of the programs listed. Please consult the programs directly with questions or concerns.\n\nGiven the unprecedented impact COVID-19 is having on peoples’ livelihoods, governments worldwide are taking measures to provide economic relief to individuals, families, and small businesses. Although not comprehensive, below is a list of potentially helpful government resources in the U.S.\n\nSummary: The U.S. has enacted two pieces of legislation - the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act - which include a wide variety of relief options, such as loans, grants, unemployment benefits, and deferred taxes for the self-employed, including independent contractors like you.\n\nAs a user of the TaskRabbit platform, you provide your services to your clients as an independent contractor. Furthermore, you are operating as a business entity — usually as a “sole proprietor.” Please find additional information in Sections 1 and 2 of TaskRabbit’s Terms of Service, as well as this Support Center article on Sole Proprietors.\n\n• Families First Coronavirus Response Act \"FFCRA\": Includes tax benefits for eligible small businesses (fewer than 500 employees) and a refundable tax credit provision for eligible independent contractors.\n\n• Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ‘‘CARES\": Includes a Federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program to provide compensation to eligible workers impacted by COVID-19, including self-employed independent contractors. Also includes the Small Business Administration’s new Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Emergency Grant Program.\n\nPandemic Unemployment Assistance: Self-employed individuals, including independent contractors, typically are not eligible for unemployment benefits, but the CARES Act for the first time broadens the eligibility guidelines to include Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) for independent workers. The program runs through December 31, 2020, and provides retroactive benefits from January 27, 2020. The U.S. Department of Labor issued guidance that expressly directs states to make PUA available to independent contractors and other self-employed individuals. The Unemployment Benefits Finder helps you learn how to file for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance in your state as an independent contractor. Note the current unprecedented demand may cause delays in application processing and receiving funds.\n\nAdditional resources\n\n• House Ways and Means CARES Act UI FAQ site\n\n• House Ways and Means CARES Act UI FAQ doc\n\n• Internal Revenue Service FAQs for Self-Employed Individuals\n\n• U.S. Department of Labor COVID-19 Resources\n\n• U.S. Department of Labor Unemployment Benefits Finder - Includes links and contact information for filing for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance in your state. Note that states are in the process of updating their websites to reflect these newly expanded benefits.\n\nSmall Business Assistance: There are two loan options available to self-employed individuals through the CARES Act: the Paycheck Protection Program, and the Economic Injury Disaster Loans and advances.\n\n• Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans: The new PPP loans are designed specifically to provide small businesses, including independent contractors and individuals operating as sole proprietors, with cash support. The PPP loans will be available through approved banks and credit unions, so consult with yours directly to see if they are participating in the program. Importantly, loan payments may be deferred and almost the entire amount of the PPP loan may be forgiven (no payback requirement) when applied toward qualifying expenses, which can be found here in the “Loan Details and Forgiveness” section. Additional resources:\n\n• U.S. Treasury CARES Small Business assistance\n\n• U.S. SBA District Office List\n\n• Treasury Department’s borrower fact sheet\n\n• Chamber of Commerce’s complete guide to the PPP\n\n• Chamber of Commerce’s PPP checklist\n\n• SBA PPP website\n\n• Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) and advances: EIDLs are low-interest, flat-rate loans that can be used to cover expenses like paid leave, payroll or lost revenue due to the pandemic. There is also an option to apply for an advance on the loan (which is being called a grant) of up to $10,000 which, when used on covered expenses, does not have to be paid back. Additional resources:\n\n• SBA EIDL Website\n\n• Chamber of Commerce step-by-step application guide\n\n• EIDL terms and conditions\n\n————————————————————————————————————\n\n“Self-employed individuals” as defined in 20 C.F.R 625.2(n) means individuals whose primary reliance for income is on the performance of services in the individual’s own business, or on the individual’s own farm. These individuals include independent contractors, including “gig economy” workers, and workers for certain religious entities.\n\nAdditional measures in the FFCRA and CARES Acts\n\n• Paid sick and family leave tax credit: The FFCRA entitles eligible self-employed individuals to an income tax credit to offset their federal self-employment tax for any taxable year equal to their “qualified sick leave equivalent amount” or “qualified family leave equivalent amount.” See IRS paid sick leave FAQs for the self-employed for additional information.\n\n• Tax filing deadline extensions: The IRS has moved the tax filing deadline for individuals and businesses from April 15 to July 15, 2020. Additional resources: IRS Filing and Payment FAQs and IRS Tax Resources (see the Tax Help section).\n\n• Payroll tax deferments: The CARES Act allows employers and self-employed individuals to delay certain types of payroll taxes. Specific requirements for tax filings are pending from the IRS. For more information, check the IRS coronavirus tax guidance page.\n\nState-level assistance: Note some states in the U.S. are offering additional assistance for the self-employed and small businesses including, for example, California and Illinois.

However, clients will be subject to a cancellation fee if either of the following are applicable:\n\nThe task was canceled by the client within 24 hours of the scheduled task time\n\nThe client is unavailable or unresponsive at the time of the task, so the task cannot be completed.\n\nThe Tasker also cannot have invoiced the client for the task. The task cannot have been canceled more than 30 days ago.\n\nClients will not be charged a cancellation fee if:\n\nThe cancellation was due to an IKEA delivery delay for an IKEA Assembly task,\n\nThe cancellation was due to the wrong task address provided through IKEA, or\n\nThe Tasker did not show up for the task.\n\nThe cancellation fee will be charged to the client's payment method associated with the task, and will be calculated as follows:\n\nThe equivalent of 1 hour at the Tasker's hourly rate and Taskrabbit fees, which cover platform usage.\n\nBy agreeing to use our platform and booking a Tasker, clients acknowledge their understanding and acceptance of this cancellation policy. It is the responsibility of the client to respond to their Tasker or Taskrabbit Support, and ensure their availability for the scheduled task.\n\nFor client cancellations meeting the criteria above, Taskers affected by these cancellations will be eligible to receive the equivalent of 1 hour of compensation at their hourly rate, in accordance with our company values, with one exception: Taskers with violations of the Taskrabbit Terms of Service in the past 90 days may be ineligible to receive compensation.\n\nIf a client refuses to pay the cancellation fee, their account may be suspended or deactivated, and they may be held responsible for any additional costs incurred by Taskrabbit or the Tasker due to the cancellation.\n\nTaskrabbit reserves the right to modify or update this policy at any time.",

Deceptive Billing Practices Ruined My TaskRabbit Experience, 1 stars [(Angel UT Longhorn, Apple App Store, 2024-03-17)](https://apple/11056391707)\nI recently used TaskRabbit to hire a tasker for some yard work, and what I thought would be a convenient and straightforward experience turned into a nightmare of hidden fees and deception. As a customer, I value transparency and honesty, but TaskRabbit failed miserably in this regard. Firstly, the advertised hourly rate of the tasker conveniently omitted significant additional fees, including a whopping \"Trust & Support Fee\" that was nowhere to be found during the browsing process. This fee, which amounted to a staggering 37% of the tasker's hourly rate, was only revealed after I received my inflated invoice. This blatant lack of transparency is nothing short of deceitful. Furthermore, the sales tax was also sneakily added to my bill, further inflating the cost of the service without any prior disclosure. Such hidden charges significantly tarnished my trust in TaskRabbit and left me feeling betrayed as a customer. TaskRabbit needs to understand that honesty and transparency are paramount in building and maintaining customer trust. Concealing fees and misleading customers is not only unethical but also undermines the integrity of the entire platform. I urge TaskRabbit to rectify these deceptive billing practices immediately and provide full transparency regarding all fees upfront. Customers deserve to know the true cost of the services they're purchasing without any unpleasant surprises. Until then, I cannot in good conscience recommend TaskRabbit to anyone, and I will certainly be seeking alternative options for my future tasks. TaskRabbit, you've lost a once-loyal customer due to your dishonesty. It's time to clean up your act and prioritize integrity over profit.",

But because my client had at one point contacted me through the platform, they were able to concoct a crazy story about our interaction, and falsely accuse me of things they couldn’t prove.\n\nWithout considering the motives of the client (primarily a full refund, as that’s what they had told me they had done in the past with other contracting situations), the moderation team paused my account for a month.

      "# BEWARE! Deceptive Billing Practices Ruined My TaskRabbit Experience, 1 stars [(Angel UT Longhorn, Apple App Store, 2024-03-17)](https://apple/11056391707)\nI recently used TaskRabbit to hire a tasker for some yard work, and what I thought would be a convenient and straightforward experience turned into a nightmare of hidden fees and deception. As a customer, I value transparency and honesty, but TaskRabbit failed miserably in this regard. Firstly, the advertised hourly rate of the tasker conveniently omitted significant additional fees, including a whopping \"Trust & Support Fee\" that was nowhere to be found during the browsing process. This fee, which amounted to a staggering 37% of the tasker's hourly rate, was only revealed after I received my inflated invoice. This blatant lack of transparency is nothing short of deceitful. Furthermore, the sales tax was also sneakily added to my bill, further inflating the cost of the service without any prior disclosure. Such hidden charges significantly tarnished my trust in TaskRabbit and left me feeling betrayed as a customer. TaskRabbit needs to understand that honesty and transparency are paramount in building and maintaining customer trust. Concealing fees and misleading customers is not only unethical but also undermines the integrity of the entire platform. I urge TaskRabbit to rectify these deceptive billing practices immediately and provide full transparency regarding all fees upfront. Customers deserve to know the true cost of the services they're purchasing without any unpleasant surprises. Until then, I cannot in good conscience recommend TaskRabbit to anyone, and I will certainly be seeking alternative options for my future tasks. TaskRabbit, you've lost a once-loyal customer due to your dishonesty. It's time to clean up your act and prioritize integrity over profit.",

I kept my rating at 4.7, with over 100 jobs completed.\n\nThere’s plenty of issues with the app. But my issue is with the freedom the platform gives clients to lie about services rendered, resulting in a discount or a complete deactivation of the Tasker. I was accused of doing something I didn’t do. By a clients partner, who didn’t contact me through Tasker. But because my client had at one point contacted me through the platform, they were able to concoct a crazy story about our interaction, and falsely accuse me of things they couldn’t prove.\n\nWithout considering the motives of the client (primarily a full refund, as that’s what they had told me they had done in the past with other contracting situations), the moderation team paused my account for a month. And then told me I was deactivated.\n\nThe reason? Beats me. But the platform doesn’t care about the professionals performing services at all. We are expendable. And trying to develop a business or positive rating on the platform is always at risk of being nulled by a disgruntled customer looking for free work. \n\nI’ve reported Task Rabbit to the BBB.

Have fun with thumbtack, where you pay for leads to jobs, even if the client doesn’t actually hire you. Or handy, where you don’t get to set your rates and get charged by handy for showing up 2 minutes late or for needing to reschedule, even in an emergency.\n\nTaskrabbit is deeply flawed, but even with this (small) fee change, they are still far and away the best service of this type with the most contractor freedom. Hopefully they quit shooting themselves in the foot with this app, but for now it’s still the best even if they don’t.\n\nAnd as others have said, the fee increase was only a few percentage points. Previously they added 15% to the Tasker rate as the listed rate the client saw, and then another 15% at the end on the final bill. And 1.15(1.15(TASKER RATE)=1.3225(TASKER RATE). So this new rate is only 3.05% higher (not 5.3% higher as the other poster said) than it was before, it’s mostly that it’s just presented differently. \n\nSounds like you just didn’t know how it worked before or you should have been angry this whole time.\n\n### Comment ID hjymphb with +2 score by [(alpha_seltzer, Reddit, 2021-11-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/qpuivi/best_alternatives/hjymphb/) (in reply to ID hjy7n80):\nHandy was the last one I haven't tried but it looks even worse than takl was. From a client POV, which OP is, the rate increase is worse than that, it went from 30% to 35%, or a 17% increase, with no value added to speak of. If a tasker sets their rate at $100, the client pays $135, with $35 going to the app for each and every hour of work, so it does appear to be a high fee. Even though TR makes more money in that example, it may be scaring clients off, especially since they made the fee more transparent in the hiring process. That may be why they are experimenting with hiding higher rate taskers from appearing in search results at all. Eventually, they will set hourly rate limits for taskers, even if this experiment is itself a de facto limit.\n\n#### Comment ID hjyn43o with +2 score by [(AnAmericanIndividual, Reddit, 2021-11-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/qpuivi/best_alternatives/hjyn43o/) (in reply to ID hjymphb):\nI just noticed that OP is a client so a lot of my post was irrelevant. Good catch.\n\nBut I’m sorry, you’re incorrect about the fee thing. Previously, if I the Tasker listed my rate at $100, the client would see $115 (100 x 1.15), and end up paying $132.25 (115 x 1.15) on the final bill. Now, if I list my rate at $100, the client sees $100, and pays $135.30 on the final bill. And .3225/.353 is only a 9% difference, not 17%. I agree that TR has added no value for that extra 9% fee, but that’s the nature of extractive middlemen and capitalism in general unfortunately.\n\nI do agree that TR is moving in the wrong direction and will eventually do everything they can to limit our rates.\n\n## Comment ID hjzuxsb with +3 score by [(geoffrey8, Reddit, 2021-11-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/qpuivi/best_alternatives/hjzuxsb/) (in reply to ID qpuivi):\nAlso regardless if there is an alternative.

Can taskers cancel for any reason without penalty? Or what are they allowed to cancel for? Do Taskers often cancel due to inclement weather? My task is not outdoors but is date-specific and there will be rain that day and periods of snowfall. Have you as a customer had this happen? How soon in advance?\n\n## Comment ID jbwbfrf with +8 score by [(AnAmericanIndividual, Reddit, 2023-03-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/11p5fop/weatherrelated_cancelations/jbwbfrf/) (in reply to ID 11p5fop):\nIf the weather is unsafe to travel, then regardless of how little notice there is, the Tasker should try to reschedule with you. If you’re not okay with that or there is no compatible future date, then the Tasker is well within their rights to cancel, and should. Safety first.\n\nEvery Tasker has a different risk tolerance, vehicle, driving skills, etc, so it is impossible to answer your question about whether taskers often cancel for inclement weather. And it isn’t a particularly useful question to ask, since every weather event is also different so other ones will have no bearing on yours.\n\nIf Taskers cancel, they are pretty much always penalized regardless of how much notice there is (at least that’s how it appears, the system is opaque). But safety should come first so they still should if it’s truly unsafe to travel. To be honest, you’re giving off pretty bad client vibes.\n\nIf it’s truly a date-specific task and you’re concerned, try to get some other possible option in place as Plan B.

TR does not directly manage Taskers, and you can find plenty of evidence on here and elsewhere of unhappy customers due to late cancels and no-shows by Taskers.   \n\n\nThe best thing you can do is choose experienced taskers, with high ratings and reviews. That is the best path to high-confidence/trustworthy taskers.  Choosing taskers with low task count and low rates involves more risk.  In smaller, newer-to-TR metros, it may be hard, but being selective is essential.   \n\n\nAfter choosing an experienced tasker, you could share your concern about weather and reliability in the task chat, and confirm they have reliable transportation and are comfortable driving in moderately inclement weather for your location. Obviously, as surely you can understand, TR does support the notion of users -- both clients and taskers -- choose personal safety over tasking, if needed, so there's the simple reality that the weather may not cooperate with your plans.   \n\n\nGood luck!\n\n## Comment ID jbxhf04 with +2 score by [(Desperate_Ad_8065, Reddit, 2023-03-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/11p5fop/weatherrelated_cancelations/jbxhf04/) (in reply to ID 11p5fop):\nI Cancel Any Task I Don’t Wanna Do Or Not Worth My Time And My Profile Works Great.

We had a similar situation happen a few months ago and had the same Tasker who recognized me from last time. I remember before he mentioned how much he loves his job and that's its the easiest money but he never mentioned the company until today. He told me he got paid $400 to disassemble this bike which took about an hour. I was interested so he showed me around the app and the opportunities that are there. \n\nTBH, it all sounded too good to be true. I used to date a girl who got wrapped up in a pyramid scheme and I can recognize a lot of the signs.

He gave me a business card and said to contact him if I need any help with other assembly related things but that's it, he was just a nice guy.\n\nI've been trying to read reviews online and while there's countless negative reviews from customers who got bad Taskers, I can't find anything from taskers and what they think of the company.

Once you start getting good reviews and a lot more tasks under your belt, it can be pretty lucrative, depending where you live.  TR I think is a gig app that is really close to actually being an independent contractor, unlike rideshare or the food apps.\n\nYou set your rates, you set the area you want to work.  You know exactly what the tasks entails and how long it should take.  There will be clients that mess this up, but for the most part, it's pretty straight forward as long as you have good communication skills and keep the client on the same page.\n\nI did just moving tasks for years, and it was super easy for me to get tasks every weekend without doing anything but being available.  I charged $60/hour, and that was for me.  The client paid 15% above that, or whatever TR additional cut was.  And my rate wasn't even super expensive.  I know a bunch of taskers that were charging north of $80/hour and getting tons of tasks.  It was pretty easy for me to make a couple hundred dollars every weekend if I pushed it.  Now think if you did this full time and charged more because you have the reviews to?  You could easily make this your full time job and make some good money, if you're in a market that TR is popular.\n\nFurniture assembly is also very popular.  So if you can do that and/or moving/heavy lifting, there is some pretty good money to be made.\n\nIf you wanted to try, now would be a good time.  Once spring comes around and into summer, clients love having taskers do stuff.  Moving is super hot category in the summer.  But remember, like starting anything new, it starts out slow.  Don't expect to sign up and instantly get tons of tasks.  You need those reviews to build your \"street cred\"\n\n## Comment ID i4ocjge with +2 score by [(DylanS89, Reddit, 2022-04-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/txsvfh/just_learned_of_task_rabbit_how_is_it_from_a/i4ocjge/) (in reply to ID txsvfh):\nI have a friend who clean for a living ahe started with handy pro(which i dont recommend for cleaning) but she was getting paid terrible money for big jobs but there were some clients she form a relationship with because of her work and end up getting repeatedly clients.

It’s not bad.  You can get hired for just about anything really.  So there’s a wide range of opportunities.\n\nI have next to know real skills and I still get hired at least several times a month.  I usually make anywhere from $200 - $400 in a months time and I don’t really make myself that available because sometimes I’m too busy to even go out tasking.\n\nYou set your own rates, set your work area, what you want to do, when you are available to work, and then wait to get hired.  You might not get any work for that day, or you might get 2 or 3 jobs.  Sometimes I’ll get 2 in one day.  I think I did 3 in one day just once.  Sometimes, it’s hit or miss, but what you want is repeat clients.  That’s where your predictable and regular income comes from.\n\nOn that guy making $400 for the bike dissemble, it’s entirely possible.  You can have your rate maxed out and then charge a 2 hour minimum, then plus a tip, yeah $400 for that job is possible.\n\nPretty much earn as much as you can.  I’d say if you have some real life handy skills, you can probably make much more.  I’ve read some people have made over 100K in a year just working as a Tasker.  I think to reach that, you need to do a lot of tasks and make it your full time gig for sure.  I just don’t have the skills to rely solely on TaskRabbit, but I’m satisfied with where I’m at and I hope it gets better from here!\n\nAlso, where you’re located will matter as well.

Show up to the job only to find out that it's a totally different assembly altogether, or the item they said they had one of is actually 10.\n\nOne huge downside of TR is that someone can hire you for a job and then be a complete no-show and you just have to eat that time and gas.

As with any marketplace, there is a wide range of providers. Individual experiences vary widely. So whether or not it meets your judgment of ‘good’, depends on your expectations of a ‘worker’, how many are available in your area to choose from and who you hire. \n\nTR’s fees currently range from 42-49% markup to the rate the tasker sets, some included in the hourly rate you see, some in a separate Trust and Support fee you won’t see until you get to the Confirmation screen in the booking process.

So you must be careful what kind of work you want done on their platform. \n\nTaskers from Taskrabbit, now that’s a different story and that depends on the type of work you want done.\n\nHighly reviewed taskers with a high task count generally means a quality tasker that will say NO to work they are not qualified to do. \n\nI typically say no to work that I am not qualified to do or where the cost of the service does not align with the “forced” hourly rates. I also reject jobs based on potential liability because of how much is covered by my provider, also just simple risk to reward analysis\n\n## Comment ID l8b39pg with +2 score by [(StartOver777, Reddit, 2024-06-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1de6i0s/is_taskrabbit_any_goodbe_honest/l8b39pg/) (in reply to ID 1de6i0s):\nThanks for sharing\n\n## Comment ID l8fez3v with +2 score by [(Salgatorium, Reddit, 2024-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1de6i0s/is_taskrabbit_any_goodbe_honest/l8fez3v/) (in reply to ID 1de6i0s):\nYou sound like a nightmare to do a task for.\n\n## Comment ID l8r4a0i with +2 score by [(bonitapequena, Reddit, 2024-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1de6i0s/is_taskrabbit_any_goodbe_honest/l8r4a0i/) (in reply to ID 1de6i0s):\nI hate that I have to pay a fuckin 25$ registration fee😭 I’m registering to make money cause I’m poor wtf makes you think I have 25$ to give away for this 😭😭😭😭💀💀💀\n\n## Comment ID lbcx5sp with +2 score by [(ken_ll, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1de6i0s/is_taskrabbit_any_goodbe_honest/lbcx5sp/) (in reply to ID 1de6i0s):\nComplete chaos.

Business is honestly better than ever for me. I get booked for virtually all of my availability and charge decent rates for my area.\n\nLast month I did 44 jobs, 80 hours, $3k(plus $2-300ish hundred cash/venmo tips). After drivetime and vehicle expenses thats just over $30/hr which is way better than I could do in my area without a degree or experience. Most I've ever made at a normal job was 22/hr but it was way more stressful.\n\nAlso I see so many people complain about the change to hiding fees in Tasker rate that started recently. Is it just me or is that actually great for most taskers? Like the total fees stayed the same at like 40% but now 1. clients aren't driven away thinking fees are higher 2. Percentage based tips mean you get higher tips since its based off of the Tasker rate with fees baked in(im not positive on this?) 3. When quoting off app its less jarring to the clients since fees are baked in. If I'm getting 30 and client see 36 and I qoute 40 off app that seems reasonable, if I'm getting 30 and client sees 32 and I qoute 40 its gonna seem like a big jump for some.\n\n## Comment ID kpfi8ll with +16 score by [(KithMeImTyson, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1alka6v/anyone_else_actually_doing_great_on_taskrabbit/kpfi8ll/) (in reply to ID 1alka6v):\nSo is this the newest crackpot marketing campaign that TR has unveiled, or what?

Is your city’s airport a hub? Likely not. Metro rank is likely not top 25. \n\nNY, LA, SF: account for as much as 50% of TR US activity. \n\nThese metros and the others in the top 10 have significantly different dynamics in play than what is a smaller metro for TR, as you describe. \n\nSearch FA in your city and sort by Completed task count. Get the count of taskers over 500 tasks. Then search LA, SF, NY, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle. There’s a significant difference, right?\n\nTo be clear, that doesn’t mean your experience is not valid, isn’t true, or doesn’t matter. All it means is, the city and the categories matter and comparisons between them aren’t always very meaningful or useful. Your experience doesn’t explain the experience in NYC, and their experience doesn’t explain yours. That’s the key point. \n\nThere have definitely been significant changes in how the platform operates over the years. This can be true, and not have any significant impact on a smaller metro, because… those changes are insignificant in a metro with less than 30 taskers available for FA. NY likely has that many that are Elite and more than 10x that available.\n\n### Comment ID kpkdqf0 with +1 score by [(PraiseTalos66012, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1alka6v/anyone_else_actually_doing_great_on_taskrabbit/kpkdqf0/) (in reply to ID kphxehz):\n\"Get the count of taskers over 500 tasks\"\nI'm surprised there was any honestly but we have a whole 2 taskers over 500.\n\nHonestly I thought my metro was alot bigger than it is, I had only ever looked up where the city ranks in population not the metro.

What you're paying for what you get me are things unrelated to my skills. You're paying for a pleasant, easy experience and peace of mind. Plenty of people, especially wealthier folks in big cities, will pay for that. They'd much rather not have to worry and pay a little extra than cheap out.\n\n1. Reliability. I make every effort to get there on time. I have missed a few tasks because literally my grandmother in another country died and I had to get a plane ticket the next day and because someone rear-ended me. Besides that I've never ever missed a task. \n\n2. Communication. If I will be late I am very communicative about it. When I see potential issues I bring it up first. If I see a better way to do something I suggest it. Don't be too talkative but relay the important stuff a client would want to know.\n\n3. Professionalism. Have work clothes that aren't too ratty or gross. Be a professional. Type in full sentences, use correct grammar and spelling. Have nice, clean business cards.\n\n4. Honesty. If you can't do something well enough, don't take it. If you get there and find out, don't charge it. I'd rather miss an hour than get a 1 star. If you mess something up make it right. Charge what you worked, don't round up without confirming with the client first. If it's within a couple minutes whatever, but don't turn 1:07 into 1:15 or 1:30. \n\nThese are things anyone can do regardless of category and skillset. But I *know* people out there aren't doing these things because I get called in all the time by clients who've had bad experiences and decide to go for the expensive guy with great reviews go not have another bad one. They tell me all about it. \n\nIf you've got all the skills but you are a jerk to clients and show up late and have BO or something, that's going to show up in your reviews and people aren't going to hire you as much or at higher rates. \n\n**Be a professional. Take pride in yourself and your work.**\n\n### Comment ID gx47vee with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-05-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/n1g8bx/hourly_rate/gx47vee/) (in reply to ID gx47uvc):\nI’m looking at Van Patten’s card and then at mine and cannot believe that Price actually likes Van Patten’s better.\n\nDizzy, I sip my drink then take a deep breath.\n\n___\n\n^(*Bot.

Second, you definitely have to have a really good rating, like all 5 stars or close to it, and have tons of reviews/tasks done.  This app is all based on client reviews, since the client basically judges who they pick by reviews and price.  So if you have a client that wants the best of the best, and is willing to pay for top notch service, that's how these taskers are getting paid $100/hour.\n\nBasically, you won't be able to charge this if you are just starting.  But once you get a bunch of experience/tasks/good ratings under your belt, then you can slowly increase your prices.  Just then, maybe you might be able to charge a high per hour rate.\n\n## Comment ID gwd1qox with +3 score by [(SpecialQue_, Reddit, 2021-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/n1g8bx/hourly_rate/gwd1qox/) (in reply to ID n1g8bx):\nI do mostly cleaning and I’ve been raising my rate slowly over time.

Advice I'd give is to write a legit bio saying what you excel at, clear and inviting headshots right away and before/afters by category when you are able to, and then make sure your rate is low enough when you have no reviews. The app has an algorithm that suggests a range to put based on your popularity, # of recent reviews/feedback, etc and as you get reviews in the app and more search hits you can push it higher.  \n\nAs a more general advice thing, communication is key. I do cleaning and when someone sends me a very low info/general scope request, I reach out right away and start asking questions to make sure I have the equipment needed and that I am willing to do everything they want done. I ask questions about whether they have allergies to chemicals or sensitivity to fragrances, when was the last time the home was professionally cleaned, if there are pets, and more. I have had very few poor experiences and 100% of them could have been avoided entirely by trusting my gut after asking all of my questions and declining it outright. Even though I took one or two against my better judgement, I have 100% 5 star reviews because I communicated to them in advance exactly what I can do, what to expect, and whether what they are asking is realistic for a solo cleaner in the time they have budgeted. And I communicate clear dealbreakers in advance, and have mutually declined jobs that would have been a nightmare and avoided a bad review or a bad client experience. \n\nAlso, because today is tax day....if you start making lots of money, don't forget to set some aside for taxes. My wallet hurts today lol\n\n## Comment ID k0n30m4 with +4 score by [(MateoScolas, Reddit, 2023-09-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/16iv6pf/is_taskrabbit_legit_and_how_much_do_yall_make/k0n30m4/) (in reply to ID 16iv6pf):\nIt can really depend on the local market.

I’d have understood if I was charged for 1hrs worth of service (even that though that itself is far above the reality), but 2hrs? For a 10 minute job? The other tasker I booked cancelled on me last minute. The 2hr minimum was not written anywhere in the tasker’s profile and was sprung on me when the task had already been accepted and I needed the job done. I could not use this to make a decision when booking the task. Such a poor experience from a customer’s perspective and I feel taken advantage of. I proceeded to delete the app as I do not plan to use this service moving forward. \n(Customer service was useless in supporting me with this issue.

It’s not until you commit to booking that it shows the accurate rate from the browse page. \n\n2. When I rescheduled an appointment for 4pm through the app, it sent a message to the tasker that I rescheduled for 2pm. \n\nThe technical issues are small, but they can have a huge impact. They can lead to miscommunication around price and timing of the appointment, which are the most important features of the app in my opinion",

          "content": "I recently used TaskRabbit to hire a tasker for some yard work, and what I thought would be a convenient and straightforward experience turned into a nightmare of hidden fees and deception. As a customer, I value transparency and honesty, but TaskRabbit failed miserably in this regard. Firstly, the advertised hourly rate of the tasker conveniently omitted significant additional fees, including a whopping \"Trust & Support Fee\" that was nowhere to be found during the browsing process. This fee, which amounted to a staggering 37% of the tasker's hourly rate, was only revealed after I received my inflated invoice. This blatant lack of transparency is nothing short of deceitful. Furthermore, the sales tax was also sneakily added to my bill, further inflating the cost of the service without any prior disclosure. Such hidden charges significantly tarnished my trust in TaskRabbit and left me feeling betrayed as a customer. TaskRabbit needs to understand that honesty and transparency are paramount in building and maintaining customer trust. Concealing fees and misleading customers is not only unethical but also undermines the integrity of the entire platform. I urge TaskRabbit to rectify these deceptive billing practices immediately and provide full transparency regarding all fees upfront. Customers deserve to know the true cost of the services they're purchasing without any unpleasant surprises. Until then, I cannot in good conscience recommend TaskRabbit to anyone, and I will certainly be seeking alternative options for my future tasks. TaskRabbit, you've lost a once-loyal customer due to your dishonesty. It's time to clean up your act and prioritize integrity over profit.",

The film was applied with many bubbles and my boyfriend helped him apply it and the service man didn’t even bother cleaning the window before applying the film ! Not as bad as the service man who took 3 days to put up blinds and milked us for over 8 hours of work daily! I’ll find a more reliable app that has replicable services available at better or fairer prices. Also Taskrabbit never returned my email for help asking for the service fee and why it was applied every hour instead of a flat fee them getting a cut of over $50 for a service fee, for every service is bull if you ask me. I thank god nothing went terrible on the tasks because the horror stories of taskers ruining peoples home and Taskrabbit saying they cannot help is bull also so what’s with that dumb fee?!???

I was accused of doing something I didn’t do. By a clients partner, who didn’t contact me through Tasker. But because my client had at one point contacted me through the platform, they were able to concoct a crazy story about our interaction, and falsely accuse me of things they couldn’t prove.\n\nWithout considering the motives of the client (primarily a full refund, as that’s what they had told me they had done in the past with other contracting situations), the moderation team paused my account for a month. And then told me I was deactivated.\n\nThe reason? Beats me. But the platform doesn’t care about the professionals performing services at all. We are expendable. And trying to develop a business or positive rating on the platform is always at risk of being nulled by a disgruntled customer looking for free work. \n\nI’ve reported Task Rabbit to the BBB. But so have hundreds of others.

Very few Taskers can make a living on the platform anymore and many of the best have left because of the changes. That is creating a negative feedback loop. \n\nThe culture seems great at first until the realization hits that only the favorites get promoted despite failing to meet their objectives. They then blame others who bear the brunt of the failure despite it not being their fault. Some of the people are turning straight evil trying to make things work and it is truly sad. Most people just don't really care and don't have to as long as they don't get blamed for anything. There is no career growth whatsoever even though they put on a really good show that they care and there are opportunities. Most people just make a few lateral moves before giving up.",

It can be hard to connect with others or feel truly engaged, and it's very much in the early stages of it's development. \r\n\r\nA lack of Black and LatinX, managers, Directors, and Senior Leadership is a shortcoming resulting in well meaning sentiments around DEIB.

The senior leadership is incredibly demoralizing, toxic, creates divides, perpetuates rumors, fear mongering culture, and incessant gas lighting. Note that nothing your team does will ever be enough because goals and objectives can change literally on a whim all because the CEO decided last minute they \"didn't like\" something. The minute a mistake is made, your job is at jeopardy and everyone that you worked with is also at risk of being on the chopping block. Anyone that is currently in senior leadership is basically a \"yes person\" to the CEO, and the directors at the company are praised for how well they play into these politics. It is totally normal for leadership to degrade and undermine teams of ICs. Leadership really has a knack for establishing zero psychological safety. It's only a matter of time before they end up running it all into the ground (which I'm confident they're on their way to doing). If you have ANY integrity in your work, STAY AWAY!!! Any good talent that is still there is already one foot out the door.",

She struggles to connect with the majority of Taskrabbit's employees (she is self-serving) and faces challenges in retaining members of the leadership team. Furthermore, she continues to appoint incompetent leaders who align with her ineffective approach and accommodate her working style. Consequently, the company's culture has become toxic and excessively political, which is disproportionate to its size. \n\nDespite the company achieving record numbers, largely attributable to the hard work of its employees, there is a strong belief that these numbers could be even higher with a different CEO at the helm. However, from an external perspective, there appears to be no immediate reason to demand a change in leadership. I hope that the board or individuals from IKEA, as stakeholders, will conduct a thorough assessment of Ania's impact on the company.",

Listen to ICs in the trenches when they offer suggestions about how to improve the company. Continue the focus on clear prioritization. Carefully consider whether fire drills merit the attention and stress they bring. When possible, promote ICs to leadership positions instead of hiring externally. Internal hires will better understand the challenges Taskrabbit is facing and how to tackle them.",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "- Like other reviewers, I agree that the strategic direction from the CEO is questionable. I wouldn't be surprised if a change in leadership occurs within the next ~12 months, but nothing has been announced. - Collaboration between the data team and engineering, design, and product is generally poor. The data team leadership micromanages ICs and doesn't allow them enough space to actually do their job. ICs are in constant tension between what's best for their product/business partners and what will make the data team look good to the SLT. - There's been sizeable attrition in some departments over the last 12 months, particularly in product. This has resulted in a large loss of institutional knowledge. Bonuses will be released at the end of October this year, and I expect there will be many more departures then too. That being said, many of the newest product hires seem excellent, and the future seems bright if we can retain them. - Bonus compensation is tied to company-level metrics and takes ~2 months to deliver after the fiscal year ends. Many newer hires were under the impression that their bonus is mostly guaranteed, which is not accurate. One positive of this structure though is that all levels of the company are working towards the same top-level goals. - Career opportunities are mixed. Taskrabbit often hires out manager/director positions, meaning there isn't much opportunity within the company for ICs to grow into leaders. - Compensation is mixed. No equity is available because Taskrabbit is wholly owned by IKEA. Mid-senior ICs comp is slightly below tech expectations (even at similarly-sized companies), but management comp is generally good because they offer more cash/bonus than comparable roles since there's no equity. - There's often a \"fire drill of the month\" which pulls everyone's attention away from their stated priorities. Sometimes these situations merit the resources they draw, but often times they don't are a result of improperly resourced infrastructure. Data team ICs are almost always the ones most pressured by these occurrences, which means their existing priorities suffer and fall behind",

It's like everyone at this company that is an IC and is in the trenches, is super passionate, and willing to grind to get projects moving along but wow the leadership does basically everything opposite from what basic leadership is expected to do. The senior leadership is incredibly demoralizing, toxic, creates divides, perpetuates rumors, fear mongering culture, and incessant gas lighting. Note that nothing your team does will ever be enough because goals and objectives can change literally on a whim all because the CEO decided last minute they \"didn't like\" something. The minute a mistake is made, your job is at jeopardy and everyone that you worked with is also at risk of being on the chopping block. Anyone that is currently in senior leadership is basically a \"yes person\" to the CEO, and the directors at the company are praised for how well they play into these politics. It is totally normal for leadership to degrade and undermine teams of ICs. Leadership really has a knack for establishing zero psychological safety. It's only a matter of time before they end up running it all into the ground (which I'm confident they're on their way to doing). If you have ANY integrity in your work, STAY AWAY!!!

This is the only reason TR retains any good talent on average for about 1 year but if you double click into it further, they all end up leaving because of leadership.

Listen to ICs in the trenches when they offer suggestions about how to improve the company. Continue the focus on clear prioritization. Carefully consider whether fire drills merit the attention and stress they bring. When possible, promote ICs to leadership positions instead of hiring externally. Internal hires will better understand the challenges Taskrabbit is facing and how to tackle them.",
        "cons": "- Like other reviewers, I agree that the strategic direction from the CEO is questionable. I wouldn't be surprised if a change in leadership occurs within the next ~12 months, but nothing has been announced. - Collaboration between the data team and engineering, design, and product is generally poor. The data team leadership micromanages ICs and doesn't allow them enough space to actually do their job. ICs are in constant tension between what's best for their product/business partners and what will make the data team look good to the SLT. - There's been sizeable attrition in some departments over the last 12 months, particularly in product. This has resulted in a large loss of institutional knowledge. Bonuses will be released at the end of October this year, and I expect there will be many more departures then too. That being said, many of the newest product hires seem excellent, and the future seems bright if we can retain them. - Bonus compensation is tied to company-level metrics and takes ~2 months to deliver after the fiscal year ends. Many newer hires were under the impression that their bonus is mostly guaranteed, which is not accurate. One positive of this structure though is that all levels of the company are working towards the same top-level goals. - Career opportunities are mixed. Taskrabbit often hires out manager/director positions, meaning there isn't much opportunity within the company for ICs to grow into leaders. - Compensation is mixed. No equity is available because Taskrabbit is wholly owned by IKEA. Mid-senior ICs comp is slightly below tech expectations (even at similarly-sized companies), but management comp is generally good because they offer more cash/bonus than comparable roles since there's no equity. - There's often a \"fire drill of the month\" which pulls everyone's attention away from their stated priorities. Sometimes these situations merit the resources they draw, but often times they don't are a result of improperly resourced infrastructure. Data team ICs are almost always the ones most pressured by these occurrences, which means their existing priorities suffer and fall behind",
        "lengthOfEmployment": 2,
        "pros": "- The company culture is overall positive. People are driven by the mission of helping Taskers earn a living, which is pretty non-evil as far as tech companies go! - Taskrabbit is serious about remote-first work, and it's never hard finding time for personal commitments (i.e. doctor appointments, childcare, etc.) - Prioritization has usually been challenging, but our CTO implemented a new quarterly planning process that makes very clear what everyones' goals and objectives are. It's not perfect, but it's a big step up from what we did before! - Work/life balance is generally good on most teams. - Benefits are excellent, including unlimited PTO you're encouraged to take, well-being stipend, productivity stipend, learning stipend, and a Taskrabbit stipend to use on the platform.",

      "# [2024’s Top ‘Core’ Aesthetics—According to Taskrabbit Data by Elizabeth Hays on 2024-10-17](https://www.taskrabbit.com/blog/2024-trend-report)\nEvery year, we analyze thousands of Taskrabbit bookings to highlight the trends that our platform’s users are bringing to life. As we dive into 2024, hyper-personalization takes center stage in the form of niche ‘core’ aesthetics popularized online. Forget cookie-cutter design trends: the theme of the moment is all about leaning into what you love, full steam ahead!\n\nThere’s no doubt that social media — which allows people to explore specific interests and connect with others who share similar tastes — is behind the ‘core’ suffix being added to trends and turned into their own aesthetics. It may have started with cottagecore, but that was just the beginning. People are turning their hobbies and passions into their whole personality, and we love it!\n\nBased on real Taskrabbit jobs, we’ve identified seven ‘core’ aesthetics trending in homes across the United States. The overarching theme of 2024 is undoubtedly curating a specific mood and aesthetic. In fact, the use of the word “aesthetic” has increased in task descriptions by 56% since last year!\n\nThe aesthetic you decide to bring into your home is totally up to you. But in case you need some inspiration, check out the top seven ‘cores’ trending among Taskrabbit users this year—and make sure to take our quiz to find out which one best matches your personality best!\n\nTrend #1: Gardencore\n\nScrolling on Gardencore TikTok is like getting transported to another world, and that’s the point! People who are burned out from the hustle and bustle of modern life and being plugged into technology 24/7 are romanticizing nature, gardening, and outdoor beauty like never before.\n\nImage credit: Alnissa Craig (@alnissa.grows)\n\nLush Landscapes\n\nTaskrabbit users are bringing a pocket of the English countryside—complete with lush lawns, blooming flowers, and trees—to their corners of the world by prioritizing landscaping tasks (+17%) and Gardening (+31%) more than ever. According to our data, the most popular flower tied to this trend is hydrangeas, which have increased in popularity by 10% since last year.\n\nRustic Furniture\n\nHaving a place to sit and truly enjoy your garden is a key element of Gardencore. Wooden benches and vintage-inspired patio furniture help create the aesthetic while offering the practical moments of relaxation you’re looking for. Furniture Assembly is up 12% over last year, proving that no matter what furniture you’re adding to your space, you don’t have to build it yourself.\n\nA Romantic Oasis\n\nUltimately, at the heart of Gardencore is creating an oasis to escape the hustle and bustle. We’ve seen those on Taskrabbit bring this theme to life in beautiful ways, from adding vintage accents (+12%) to installing fountains (+12%) and adding pebble walkways (+15%) to their yards. But our favorite trend is that this personal oasis is being shared with others: help with backyard weddings is up 200% since last year!\n\nTrend #2: Craftcore\n\nDo you love handmade and one-of-a-kind items? Craftcore is all about celebrating the hobby of crafting, from creating inspiring spaces to showcasing handmade projects once they’re completed. If you love the idea of crocheting your own throw blankets or creating an inspiring craft room for your hobbies, you’ll love all things Craftcore!\n\nImage credit: Juan Marquez (@homewithjuan)\n\nHandmade Crafts\n\nUnsurprisingly, crafting is at the heart of Craftcore. No matter what your crafting hobby is—whether it’s sewing, painting, or making friendship bracelets—craftcore is all about making things yourself, and showing them off! Crafty people are hiring Taskers to help them incorporate their handmade (+17%) projects into their decor, whether that means mounting a recent art piece on the wall or helping them move a freshly painted furniture piece from the garage back inside.\n\nArt Everywhere\n\nWith the Craftcore aesthetic, your home is your canvas. Taskrabbit users are taking this to heart by sprucing up their spaces with bold gallery walls (+26%) mosaics (+21%), and murals (+27%). Not a homeowner? Don’t let that stop you! Renter-friendly home improvements are up 142%, including fun, artistic peel-and-stick wallpaper (+75%).\n\nTrend #3: Hostingcore\n\nReady to be the host with the most? The Hostingcore aesthetic revolves around the art of hosting and entertaining guests, emphasizing the creation of warm, inviting, and beautifully curated spaces for gatherings. It combines elements of hospitality, interior design, and culinary arts to create memorable experiences for guests. Here’s how we’re seeing it come to life on Taskrabbit.\n\nImage credit: Cristina Viseu (@cristinaviseu)\n\nInviting Atmosphere\n\nCreating a space that your guests will never want to leave is a key element of this core. We’re seeing our clients prioritize interior design (+17%) and furniture layout (+9%) to get the Feng Shui where it needs to be, as well as investing in sleeper sofas (113%) for any overnight guests. Mood lighting is also key: light hanging is up 42%!\n\nStaying Party Ready\n\nAre you ready to host at a moment’s notice? It’s okay if not, but Taskers can help you look like you are! Residents are hiring Taskers to help them with party cleaning (+20%) and decluttering (+8%) so there’s no corner of the home that’s not ready for guests. But that’s not all that they’re using Taskers for. Party-related tasks are up 40%! Personal Assistant Taskers can help prep and send invitations, decorate, and shop for your party. Yes, please!\n\nBeverage Stations\n\nWhen it comes to hosting, drinks are key. This year, we’re seeing more task requests including home bars (+46%), and mini-fridges (26%), as well as 9X the amount of tasks including “mocktail” in the job descriptions. Cheers!\n\nTrend #4: Sportscore\n\nAfter this summer’s Challengers craze, the rising prevalence of pickleball, and the summer games, all things sports are trending. The influence of court sports lends itself to preppy style and decor, but all things athletic are fair game when it comes to incorporating this trend into your aesthetic. Think home gyms, bright colors, clean lines, sports memorabilia, and surges in lawn game setup.\n\nImage credit: Olivia Rose (@originalrose)\n\nClub Decor\n\nWe may not all be professional athletes, but we can set up our spaces to pretend like we are! Elements of a health club aesthetic—like help with repainting the walls of a locker room and overall maintenance (+61%)—are trending on our platform.\n\nPreppy Court Vibes\n\nCourt sports are all the rage right now. The pickleball craze is taking over; with pickleball-related tasks trending 80% year over year. People are also decorating with sports gear (+33%) by mounting rackets. And the accent color of the season? You guessed it: tennis ball yellow (+16%).\n\nWellness Amenities\n\nWhy go to the gym when you can stay home and sweat it out? Home gym (+17%) amenities and wellness spaces are trending on Taskrabbit this year, with a special emphasis on home gym organization (+14%).\n\nTrend #5: Westerncore\n\nWhether you’ve listened to Beyonce’s Cowboy Carter album on repeat, streamed Kacey Musgraves’ latest record, or stuck to the country classics, the iconic Western look is having a resurgence as timeless elements like leather, suede, and fringe take over. While many embrace this aesthetic with their fashion, it continues to influence home decor as well, bringing a cozy vibe with earthy tones, reclaimed wood, leather furnishings, and vintage Americana-themed prints.\n\nImage credit: Alison Epperley (@alisonepperley)\n\nNatural Materials\n\nA key element of Westercore is using natural materials like wood, leather (+9%), and metal to create a rugged, rustic look. Taskrabbit users are all about decorating with cactus (+44%)—both as a motif and as an easy-to-care-for plant that embodies the Western vibe.\n\nWestern Motifs\n\nSaddle up! Western motifs like horseshoes, cow skulls, and star symbols are trending big. Western tasks in general are trending 19% over last year, with saddles (+46%) and saloons (+50%) taking center stage with a 46% increase year over year.\n\nCozy Campfire Vibes\n\nS’mores anyone? Taskrabbit clients are cozying up their spaces and escaping to more rugged surroundings in 2024. Tasks related to campgrounds—including setting up campsites and property maintenance—are up 300%. We’ve also seen a boost in job requests related to cozy decor (+30%) and cabins (+11%).\n\nTrend #6: Techcore\n\nWith AI creeping into daily life, is anyone surprised that the techcore aesthetic is trending? With an emphasis on futuristic design, high-tech gadgets, and a sleek, modern look, Techcore not only seeks to create a space that’s technology-forward but also helps with energy consumption. Thanks, smart home!\n\nImage credit: Vince Do (@vinceddo)\n\nCutting-Edge Devices\n\nNew technology—like VR headsets and drones—is taking over, but there’s a learning curve associated with setting up this new tech. Taskrabbit clients are requesting help with computers (+242%) and with all things wireless (+105%) more than they did last year.\n\nSmart Home Devices\n\nBy adding green features such as smart home installations (+220%), eco-friendly (+13%) appliances, and security systems (+175%), homeowners are taking full advantage of the perks—and sustainability—of more futuristic living environments.\n\nModern Design\n\nModern furniture that compliments tech with sleek lines and minimalistic design seamlessly fits into the Techcore aesthetic. Here at Taskrabbit, we’ve seen a surge of tasks requesting theater seats (66%), suggesting that fully connected home theaters are also part of the Techcore lifestyle.\n\nTrend #7: Colorcore\n\nBeige and white shiplap is out, and bright, bold colors are in! The Colorcore aesthetic celebrates the joy and energy that come with bright hues and dynamic color combinations, often creating a visually stimulating and cheerful environment. Here’s how you can bring it into your space.\n\nImage credit: Megan Zietz (@meganzietz)\n\nColorful Interiors\n\nColorcore is all about home decor that includes bright (+10%) walls, vibrant furniture, and bold (+21%) accessories. Taskrabbit users aren’t shying away from wall painting (+13%) with bright colors, even pink, which has been requested 23% more than last year. They’re even adding color beneath their feet with floor tiles (+22%).\n\nAccent Pieces\n\nAdd pops of personality to your space with accents (+14%) like colorful rugs, artwork, and other decor. Taskrabbit users are embracing patterns (+36%), requesting help to clean and/or pack their decorative pillows (+80%), and especially all things eclectic (+200%) to bring more color into their spaces.\n\nPatterns and Prints\n\nWhen in doubt, go for the bold pattern or print! One of the most fun ways to embrace this style is through wallpapering, which has spiked 70% over the last year. Art Deco—a style characterized by bold shapes and colors—is also up 33% over last year.\n\nBringing the Trends to Life\n\nNo matter your personal aesthetic, Taskrabbit is here to help you infuse it into your home.\n\nFrom Yard Work to Wallpaper Installation, Taskers are waiting on standby to help with everything you need. Want help mounting art for a new gallery wall? Check. Ready for a high-tech home, minus the installation? Consider it done. Hosting a party and need help shopping, cleaning, and building new seating? You can get it all done with help from a Tasker.\n\nAnd if you want to help bring these trends and more to life, sign up to become a Tasker. Furniture Assembly ($41/hr), Mounting ($52/hr), Yard Work (N/A), Wallpapering ($63/hr), Smart Home Installations ($56/hr), Electrical Help ($58/hr), Cleaning ($42/hr) are all in high demand.",

The Agreement also includes all other supplemental policies and terms referenced and/or linked to within these Terms or which are otherwise made available to you, all of which also apply to your use of the Platform and are incorporated into the Agreement by reference (including, without limitation, the IKEA Pre-Paid Assembly Service Terms and Conditions for IKEA Pre-paid Assembly Tasks, as applicable ).\n\nFOR U.S. AND CANADIAN USERS, SECTION 24 CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST TASKRABBIT TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING, IF APPLICABLE, YOUR RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION.\n\nBY ACKNOWLEDGING THE TERMS OF SERVICE AND/OR ACCESSING AND USING THE PLATFORM, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY (WITHOUT LIMITATION OR QUALIFICATION), THE AGREEMENT (INCLUDING, ALL TERMS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE).\n\nIF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE AGREEMENT AND ABIDE BY ITS TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE PLATFORM.\n\n1.The Platform.\n\nA. Online Marketplace.\n\nThe Platform is an online web- and app-based two-sided marketplace which enables connections between Clients and Taskers. “Client(s)” are individuals and/or businesses seeking to obtain short-term services (“Task(s)”), and “Tasker(s)” are businesses seeking to perform Tasks for Clients. Clients and Taskers are referred to herein together as “User(s)”.\n\nTaskers are independent business owners, providing services under their own name or business name (and not under Taskrabbit’s name), using their own tools and supplies. Taskers choose the applicable rates for Tasks, without deduction by Taskrabbit. Taskers may (a) maintain a clientele without any restrictions from Taskrabbit; (b) offer and provide their services elsewhere, including through competing platforms; and (c) accept or reject Clients and Service Agreements (defined below). Taskers are independent contractors of Clients, and Clients are therefore clients of Taskers, not Taskrabbit.\n\nAny reference to a Tasker being licensed or credentialed in some manner, or being \"badged”, “reliable”, “reliability rate”, “elite”, “great value”, \"background checked\", “vetted” (or similar language) indicates only that the Tasker has completed a relevant user account registration process or met certain criteria and does not, and shall not be deemed to, represent anything else. Any such description: (i) is intended to be useful information for Clients to evaluate when they make their own decisions about the identity and suitability of Taskers whom they select or interact, or contract with via the Platform; and (ii) is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Taskrabbit of a Tasker’s skills or qualifications or whether they are licensed, insured, trustworthy, safe or suitable.\n\nNotwithstanding any feature or service of the Platform that a Client may use to expedite Tasker selection, the Client is responsible for determining the Task and selecting or otherwise approving their Tasker and should undertake their own research prior to booking any Task to be satisfied that a specific Tasker has the right qualifications.\n\nB. Taskrabbit’s Role.\n\nThe Platform is not an employment agency service or business, and Taskrabbit is not an employer of any User. Users are not employees, partners, representatives, agents, joint venturers, independent contractors or franchisees of Taskrabbit.\n\nUsers hereby acknowledge and agree that (a) Taskrabbit does not (i) perform Tasks nor employ individuals to perform Tasks, (ii) supervise, scope, direct, control or monitor Taskers’ work (including that Taskrabbit does not set Taskers’ work locations, work hours, or terms of work), nor provide tools or supplies to, or pay any expenses of, Taskers, or (iii) have any control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of Tasks or Users (or the acts or omissions thereof), nor of the integrity, responsibility, competence, qualifications, communications, or the ratings or reviews provided by Users with respect to each other; and (b) the formation of a Service Agreement will not, under any circumstances, create any responsibility or liability for Taskrabbit, nor any employment or other relationship between Taskrabbit and the Users or between the Client and the Tasker. Users do not have authority to, and may not act as agent for, nor bind or make any representations on behalf of, Taskrabbit (including that Taskers may not modify all or any part of the Taskrabbit fees (see Section 3 below).\n\nTaskrabbit is neither responsible nor liable for workers’ compensation or any tax payment or withholding, including but not limited to applicable sales taxes, HST/QST/GST/PST, unemployment or employment insurance, Canada Pension Plan, disability insurance, applicable VAT, National Insurance, employer’s liability, employer training tax, social security contributions, PAYE or other applicable payroll withholdings in connection with a User’s use of the Platform, or personal income tax. The Tasker assumes full and sole responsibility for all required and applicable income tax and social contributions such as Social Security or National Insurance Contribution withholdings as to the Tasker and all persons engaged by the Tasker in the performance of the Task Services. Each User assumes all liability for proper classification of such User’s workers based on applicable legal guidelines.\n\nC. License.\n\nSubject to your compliance with the terms of the Agreement (including, without limitation, these Terms and Taskrabbit’s Acceptable Use Policy), Taskrabbit grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable and revocable license to (a) access and use the Platform (in the locations and territories where the Platform has a presence), (b) download, access and use the App on your personal device, solely in furtherance of your use of the Platform, and (c) access and view any content, information and materials made available on the Platform, in all cases for your personal use and the intended purpose of the Platform. All Users are subject to, and agree to comply with, the Acceptable Use Policy in their use of the Platform. Users may not copy, download, use, redesign, reconfigure, reverse engineer or retransmit the Platform or anything therefrom or thereon (in whole or in part) without Taskrabbit’s prior written consent. Any rights not granted by Taskrabbit are expressly reserved.\n\nD. User Representations and Warranties.\n\nIn your access to and use of the Platform, you represent and warrant that you:\n\nwill comply fully with the terms of the Agreement, including, without limitation, these Terms and the Acceptable Use Policy and other Supplemental Terms;\n\nare at least of the legally required age in the jurisdiction in which you reside, and are otherwise capable of entering into binding contracts;\n\nhave the right, authority and capacity to enter into the Agreement (including that you have the right and authority to act on behalf of, and bind to the Agreement, any company or organization on whose behalf you are entering into the Agreement);\n\nwill only request and/or perform (as applicable) Tasks in a country where the Platform has a presence;\n\nwill respect the privacy (including, without limitation, private, family and home life), property, and data protection rights of Users and will not record (whether video or audio or otherwise) any Task or any interaction by or with any User and/or Taskrabbit without obtaining the prior written consent of Taskrabbit and/or the relevant User, as applicable;\n\nwill act professionally and responsibly in your interactions with, and fulfill the commitments you make to, other Users (including by communicating clearly and promptly through the Chat Thread, and being present and/or available at the time you agree upon with other Users);\n\nwill only utilize the third-party PSP (as defined in the Fees, Payments and Cancellation Supplemental Terms) to make or receive payment for Tasks;\n\nwill use your legal name and/or legal business name (as per your government issued identification and registration documents) and an up-to-date photo on your profile;\n\nwill comply with all applicable local, state, provincial, national, or international laws in your use of the Platform;\n\nwill not use the Platform for the purchase or delivery of alcohol, or any other controlled or illegal substances or services; and\n\nwill ensure that all communications regarding Tasks (including, without limitation, scoping and payments and any questions relevant to Tasks), remain on the Platform, before, during and after the Task.\n\nE. Additional Tasker Representations and Warranties.\n\nIf you are a Tasker, you additionally represent and warrant that, in your access to and use of the Platform, you:\n\nare operating as a sole proprietor, partnership, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, corporation or other business entity when using the Platform;\n\nare customarily engaged in an independently established business of the same nature as the services performed for Clients through the Platform, and maintain an independent clientele;\n\nhave the unrestricted right to work in the jurisdiction in which you perform Tasks;\n\nhave and will maintain (at your own expense) any licenses, permits, and/or registrations required by applicable laws that apply to your performance of Tasks (including, as applicable, a business license, business tax registration, and/or contractor’s license);\n\nhave and will maintain all insurance required to operate your business and perform the Tasks;\n\nwill respond to invitations promptly; provide timely, high-quality services for your Clients as agreed in the Chat Thread (defined below); only offer and provide Tasks for which you have the necessary expertise to perform; and perform the Tasks as agreed upon with your Client in a safe manner; and\n\nwill promptly disclose to Taskrabbit in writing if you have any potentially relevant criminal convictions (other than minor fixed penalty parking or speeding offenses) that arise during your use of the Platform.\n\n2.Use of the Platform.\n\nA. Registration.\n\nYou must register and create an account to access and use the Platform, providing only correct and accurate information (such as, without limitation, your name, business name, mailing address, email address, and/or telephone number). You agree to immediately notify Taskrabbit (at help.tr.co) of any changes to your account information. If any such change relates to ownership of your telephone numbers, you may notify Taskrabbit by texting STOP to any text message sent to the retiring phone number. Failure to provide and maintain updated and accurate information may result in your inability to use the Platform and/or Taskrabbit’s termination of this Agreement with you. Taskrabbit may restrict anyone from completing registration if Taskrabbit determines such person may threaten the safety and integrity of the Platform, or if such restriction is necessary to address any other reasonable business concern.\n\nB. Account Security.\n\nYou are fully and solely responsible for (a) maintaining the confidentiality of any log-in, password, and account number provided by or given to you to access the Platform; and (b) all activities that occur under your password or account, even if not authorized by you. Taskrabbit has no control over any User’s account. You agree to notify Taskrabbit immediately if you suspect any unauthorized party may be using your Platform password or account or any other breach of security.\n\nC. Tasker Onboarding\n\n(i) Background Checks. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Taskers may be subject to a review process before they can register on, and during their use of, the Platform, which may include, but is not limited to, identity verification and criminal background checks, using third party services as appropriate (“Background Check(s)”). If a Tasker, to the extent permitted under applicable law, you agree to undergo such Background Checks. Taskrabbit cannot, and does not, assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or reliability of Background Check information, nor for any false or misleading statements made by Users of the Platform.\n\n(ii) Professional Licensing. Taskrabbit does not independently verify that Taskers have the necessary expertise, or have obtained any licenses, permits, or registrations required, to perform their Tasks. It may be unlawful to perform certain types of Tasks without a license, permit and/or registration, and performing same may result in law enforcement action and/or penalties or fines. Taskers are solely responsible for avoiding such prohibited Tasks. If you have questions about how national, state, provincial, territorial and/or local laws apply to your Tasks on the Platform, you should first seek appropriate legal guidance. Clients are solely responsible for determining if a Tasker has the skills and qualifications necessary to perform the specific Task and confirming that the Tasker has obtained all required licenses, permits, or registrations, if any. Clients may wish to consult their national, state, provincial, territorial and/or local law requirements to determine whether certain Tasks are required to be performed by a licensed or otherwise registered professional.\n\nD. Service Agreement.\n\nThe Platform allows Users to offer, search for and book Tasks. After identifying and selecting a Tasker to perform a Task, the Client and the Tasker may communicate via the chat thread in the Platform (the “Chat Thread”) to understand the scope, schedule and other details of the Task (including, without limitation, any specific hazards, obstacles, or impediments in the Task location (whether visible or concealed) that may impact the performance of the Task). Once the Task is scheduled via the Platform by the Tasker, the Client and Tasker form a legally binding contract for the Task, which includes the engagement terms proposed and accepted, and any other contractual terms agreed to, by the Client and the Tasker in the Chat Thread for the Task (the “Service Agreement”). The Client and the Tasker each agree to comply with the Service Agreement and the Agreement during the engagement, performance and completion of a Task. Taskers are responsible for exercising their own business judgment in entering into Service Agreements and performing Tasks; and acknowledge that there is a chance for individual profit or loss. Taskrabbit is not a party to any Service Agreement. The formation of a Service Agreement will not, under any circumstances, create any responsibility or liability for Taskrabbit.\n\nE. Other Parties\n\n(i) Tasker Assistants. Where approved in advance by the Client in the Chat Thread for the Task, Taskers may engage assistants, helpers, subcontractors or other personnel (“Tasker Assistant(s)”) to perform all or any part of a Task; provided that such Tasker Assistants have registered through the Platform and meet all of the requirements applicable to the Tasker as set out in the Agreement. The Tasker assumes full and sole responsibility for the acts and omissions of all Tasker Assistants used in its performance of Tasks and is fully responsible for: (a) the lawful payment of all compensation, benefits and expenses for its Tasker Assistants, (b) all required and applicable tax withholdings as to such Tasker Assistants, and (c) ensuring all Tasker Assistants are registered Taskers on the Platform.\n\n(ii) Client Agents. The Client agrees that if they have authorized someone other than the Client to book a Task on their behalf or to be present in their stead when the Task is performed, the Client is appointing that person as their agent (“Client Agent(s)”), and the Client is deemed to have granted to the Client Agent the authority to act as their agent in relation to the applicable Task. Client Agents may direct or instruct the Tasker’s performance of the Task, and the Tasker may follow such direction as if the direction was given by the Client. The Client assumes full and sole responsibility for the acts and omissions of Client Agents.\n\nF. IKEA Pre-paid Assembly Services.\n\nTo the extent you’ve purchased IKEA Pre-paid Assembly Services, through IKEA in-store or online, the IKEA Pre-paid Assembly Terms and Conditions will apply to these services, in addition to the terms elsewhere in the Agreement.\n\n3.Fees, Billing, Invoicing, and Payment; Cancellation.\n\nThe terms relevant to fees (including Tasker Payments and Taskrabbit’s fees), invoicing, payment (including for Tasks, and any other amounts owed by Users hereunder) and cancellation, are set out the Fees, Payments and Cancellation Supplemental Terms, which applies to your access to and use of the Platform. Unless otherwise expressly stated in this Agreement, all fees (including, without limitation, the Task Payment and all Taskrabbit fees) are non-refundable.\n\n4.Contests and Promotional Codes.\n\nTaskrabbit may, from time to time, provide certain optional promotional codes, opportunities and contests to Users. All such optional promotional opportunities will be run at the sole discretion of Taskrabbit, will be subject to the terms and conditions governing same, and can be implemented, modified, or removed at any time by Taskrabbit without advance notification. The liability of Taskrabbit and Affiliates relevant to such promotional opportunities and contests, shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 13 of these Terms.\n\n5.Public Areas.\n\nThe Platform may contain profiles, email systems, blogs, message boards, reviews, ratings, task postings, chat areas, news groups, forums, communities and/or other message or communication facilities (“Public Areas”) that allow Users to communicate with other Users. You may only use such community areas to send and receive messages and materials that are relevant and proper to the applicable forum.\n\nYou understand that all submissions made to Public Areas will be public, and you will be publicly identified by your name or login identification when communicating in Public Areas. Taskrabbit will not be responsible for the actions of any Users with respect to any information or materials posted or disclosed in Public Areas.\n\n6.Deactivation and Suspension.\n\nIn the event of an actual or suspected breach by you of any part of the Agreement (including, without limitation, abuse, fraud or interference with the proper working of the Platform), Taskrabbit may (a) suspend your right to use the Platform pending its investigation; and/or (b) deactivate your account or limit your use of the Platform upon its confirmation of a breach. Taskrabbit will provide you with written notice of its determination in accordance with, and as required by, applicable laws. If you wish to appeal any determination made by Taskrabbit pursuant to this Section, please contact us here within 14 days of receipt of such notice with the grounds for your appeal.\n\nIf Taskrabbit suspends or deactivates your account or limits your use of the Platform pursuant to this Section 6, you may not register and/or create a new account under different usernames, identities or contact details (whether under your or any other name or business name), even if you are acting on behalf of a third party.\n\n7.Termination.\n\nYou may terminate the Agreement between you and Taskrabbit at any time by ceasing all use of the Platform and deactivating your account. Taskrabbit may terminate the Agreement between you and Taskrabbit at any time, and cease providing access to the Platform (pursuant to Section 6 above), if you breach any part of the Agreement or violate applicable laws.\n\nEven after your right to use the Platform is suspended, terminated or limited, the Agreement will remain enforceable against you. Taskrabbit reserves the right to take appropriate legal action pursuant to the Agreement.\n\n8.User Generated Content; Feedback.\n\nA. User Generated Content.\n\n“User Generated Content” is defined as any information, content and materials (including any videotape, film, recording, photograph, voice) you provide to Taskrabbit, its agents, Affiliates, and corporate partners, or other Users in connection with your registration for and use of the Platform (including, without limitation, the information and materials posted or transmitted for use in Public Areas).\n\nUser Generated Content is not the opinion of, and has not been verified or approved by, Taskrabbit.

Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or limitation of incidental or consequential damages; in such cases the above limitations may not apply to you in their entirety.\n\nIF, NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING EXCLUSIONS, IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE TASKRABBIT PARTIES OR THEIR CORPORATE PARTNERS ARE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES, IN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY, WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED: (A) IF YOU ARE A CLIENT, THE TOTAL FEES PAID BY YOU TO TASKRABBIT IN THE 6 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE TIME SUCH CLAIM AROSE; AND (B) IF YOU ARE A TASKER, THE TOTAL TASK PAYMENTS PAID TO YOU BY CLIENTS IN THE 6 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE TIME SUCH CLAIM AROSE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing:\n\nFor All Residents of a Country Outside of the United States: Regardless of any other provision in the Agreement excluding or limiting Taskrabbit’s liability, nothing in these Terms excludes or limits Taskrabbit’s warranties and liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by Taskrabbit; or (b) Taskrabbit’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n\nFor Residents of Germany only: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, Taskrabbit is only liable for breach caused by willful misconduct or gross negligence of its cardinal, material contractual obligations. In the event of initial impossibility, Taskrabbit may only be liable if it was aware of the impediment to performance prior to entering the Agreement, was unwilling due to gross negligence to remedy that impediment, and a cardinal obligation was breached as a result of that initial impossibility.\n\n14.Indemnification.\n\nUsers’ indemnification obligations are set out below in this Section. Taskrabbit reserves the right, in its own sole discretion, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to your indemnification. You will not, in any event, settle any claim or matter without the prior written consent of Taskrabbit.\n\nA. Client Indemnification.\n\nIf you are a Client, you shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Taskrabbit and Affiliates from and against any and all Liabilities incurred in connection with (i) your use of, inability to use, or participation on, the Platform; (ii) your breach or violation of the Agreement; (iii) your violation of any law, or the rights of any User or third party; (iv) your use of any third-party links or websites that appear on the Platform; (v) any User Generated Content and/or Feedback submitted by you or using your account to the Platform, including but not limited to the extent such content may infringe on the intellectual rights of a third party or otherwise be illegal or unlawful; and (vi) the acts or omissions of any Client Agents.\n\nB. Tasker Indemnification.\n\nIf you are a Tasker, you shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Taskrabbit and Affiliates from and against any and all Liabilities incurred in connection with (i) your use of, inability to use, or participation on, the Platform; (ii) your participation in Tasks, or your ability or inability to perform Tasks or to receive payment therefor; (iii) your breach or violation of the Agreement; (iv) your violation of any law, or the rights of any User or third party; (v) any User Generated Content and/or Feedback submitted by or about you or using your account to the Platform, including but not limited to the extent such content may infringe on the intellectual rights of a third party or otherwise be illegal or unlawful; and (vi) the acts or omissions of any Tasker Assistants.\n\n15.Dispute Resolution.\n\nTo expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to, arising from or regarding your use of the Platform, your relationship with Taskrabbit, Tasks, or the Agreement (including previous versions), (“Dispute”), you can try to find an amicable solution with Taskrabbit before initiating any out of court settlement (such as mediation or arbitration) or court proceeding (except as may be set forth in Section 24). Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice. Your address for such notices is the one associated with your account, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to Taskrabbit. Taskrabbit’s address for such notice is as set out here.\n\n16.App Store-Sourced Apps.\n\nIf you access or download any App from the Apple App Store, you agree to Apple’s Licensed Application End User License Agreement and will comply therewith in your access to and use of the App(s). If you access or download any App from the Google Play Store, you agree to Google Play Terms of Service and will comply therewith in your access to and use of the App(s).\n\n17.Changes to the Agreement, the Platform and the App.\n\nA. Changes to the Agreement.\n\nTaskrabbit reserves the right, for justifiable and proportionate reasons, at any time, to review, change, modify, update, add to, supplement, suspend, discontinue, or delete any term(s) or provision(s) of the Agreement (including the Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Acceptable Use Policy and/or Happiness Pledge).\n\nNotice of such amendments may be given by posting such updates or modifications (or notice thereof) on the Platform, on the online location of the relevant terms, policies or supplemental terms, by e-mail or in any other reasonable manner; and the amendments will be effective upon such posting. Your continued use of the Platform after such posting constitutes your consent to be bound by the Agreement, as amended.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if such modifications and/or updates are material, you will be informed in advance (in the manner set out in this Section) for your acceptance or rejection. If any changes to the Agreement are unacceptable to you or cause you to no longer be in compliance with the Agreement, the previous Terms will apply to your current Tasks, but you will not be able to use the Platform or contract new Tasks and you must deactivate your account, and immediately stop using the Platform. After notifying you of any material changes, your continued use of the Platform following any revision to the Agreement constitutes your complete and irrevocable acceptance of any and all such changes, except where prohibited by any laws or regulations in your jurisdiction.\n\nTo the extent permitted by law, Taskrabbit shall not be liable to you for any modification to all or any portion of the Agreement.\n\nB. Changes to the Platform.\n\nTaskrabbit reserves the right to, at any time, review, improve, modify, update, upgrade, discontinue, impose limits, or restrict access to, whether temporarily or permanently, all or any portion of the Platform (including any content or information available on or through the Platform), effective with prior notice (where possible) and without any liability to Taskrabbit. To the extent permitted by law, Taskrabbit shall not be liable to you for any updates, upgrades, modifications to or discontinuance of all or any portion of the Platform.\n\nC. Mobile App Updates and Upgrades.\n\nBy installing the App(s), you consent to the installation of the App(s) and any updates or upgrades that are released through the Platform. The App (including any updates or upgrades) may (i) cause your device to automatically communicate with Taskrabbit’s servers to deliver the App functionality and to record usage metrics, (ii) affect App-related preferences or data stored on your device, and/or (iii) collect personal information as set out in our Privacy Policy. You can uninstall the App(s) at any time.\n\n18.No Rights of Third Parties.\n\nExcept as expressly set out herein and/or is otherwise required by applicable laws, the Agreement is for the sole benefit of Taskrabbit and the User, and their permitted successors and assigns, and there are no other third-party beneficiaries under the Agreement. None of the terms of the Agreement are enforceable by any persons who are not a party to the Agreement; provided, however, that Taskrabbit may enforce any such provisions on behalf of its Affiliates. In the United Kingdom, no terms are enforceable under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 by a person who is not a party to the Agreement, provided, however, that a Client’s Agent may act in the name of and on behalf of their Client.\n\n19.Notices and Consent to Receive Notices Electronically.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the Agreement, all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications (collectively, “Notices”) under the Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or email; or the day it is shown as delivered by the overnight delivery service’s tracking information, if sent for next day delivery by a recognized overnight delivery service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Notices to which the Agreement refers will be sent to you electronically (including, without limitation, by email or by posting Notices on the Sites), and you consent to receive Notices in this manner. All notices that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.\n\nIf you have any questions about these Terms of Service or about the Platform, please contact us here.\n\n20.Consent to Electronic Signatures.\n\nBy using the Platform, you agree (a) to transact electronically through the Platform; (b) your electronic signature is the legal equivalent of your manual signature and has the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a paper-based signature; (c) your use of a keypad, mouse or other device to select an item, button, icon or similar act/action, constitutes your signature as if actually signed by you in writing; and (d) no certification authority or other third party verification is necessary to validate your electronic signature, and the lack of such certification or third party verification will not in any way affect the enforceability of your electronic signature.\n\n21. Governing Law.\n\nExcept for Sections 15 (Dispute Resolution) and/or 24 (Jurisdiction-specific Provisions) hereof, the Agreement and your use of the Platform will be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws as set out in this Section (without regard to choice of law principles):\n\nFor Users within the United States: The laws of the State of California.\n\nFor Users outside of the United States: English law, and any dispute regarding the Agreement or the use of the Platform will only be dealt with by the English courts.\n\nThe choices of law set out in this Section shall apply unless and to the extent federal, state, provincial, local and international laws, rules, regulations, directives, judgments and/or orders binding on or applicable to you or your performance hereunder, require that the Agreement or your use of the Platform be governed by the laws of the country in which the Task is performed. This provision is intended only to designate the governing laws to interpret the Agreement and is not intended to create any substantive right to non-residents of the designated country/province/state to assert claims under such law whether by statute, common law, or otherwise. Nothing shall prevent Taskrabbit from bringing proceedings to protect our intellectual property rights before any competent court.\n\n22.Notices.\n\nThe Taskrabbit Platform, websites and Apps are owned and operated by Taskrabbit, Inc., a company registered in Delaware (United States). Our registration number is 4599240 and our tax identification number in Europe is EU528004784. If you have any questions about the Agreement or the Platform, please contact us by using the means listed here.\n\n23.General Provisions.\n\na. Relationship of the Parties.\n\nNo agency, partnership, joint venture, employer-employee or franchiser-franchisee relationship exists, is intended or created between you and Taskrabbit by the Agreement or your use of the Platform. Users do not have authority to act as agent for, nor to bind or make any representations on behalf of, Taskrabbit.\n\nb. Entire Agreement.\n\nThe Agreement (including any terms linked to in, and incorporated by reference into, these Terms) constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between you and Taskrabbit with respect to your use of the Platform, and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements, proposals or communications, except as otherwise specified in the Arbitration Agreement in Section 24(A). However, the Agreement does not supersede other agreements about other subject matter that you may have with Taskrabbit, such as the IKEA Pre-paid Assembly Service Terms and Conditions. The provisions of the Agreement are intended to be interpreted in a manner which makes them valid, legal, and enforceable.\n\nc. Severability; Waiver.\n\nExcept for the “Agreement Prohibiting Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” provision in Section 24(A) below, in the event any provision is found to be partially or wholly invalid, illegal or unenforceable, (1) such provision shall be modified or restructured to the extent and in the manner necessary to render it valid, legal, and enforceable, or (2) if such provision cannot be so modified or restructured, it shall be excised from the Agreement without affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of any of the remaining provisions. Failure by Taskrabbit to enforce any provision(s) of the Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right.\n\nYou hereby acknowledge and agree that we may assign or transfer the Agreement without your consent. In any case, this assignment will be notified to the User who, in the event legally foreseen, may terminate the Agreement and cease use of the Platform. Upon the effective date of the assignment of the Agreement (a) Taskrabbit shall be relieved of all rights, obligations and/or liabilities to you arising in respect of events postdating the effective date of the assignment, and (b) the assignee entity shall replace Taskrabbit for the performance of the Agreement. You may not assign or transfer the Agreement without our prior written approval. Any assignment in violation of this Section 23 shall be null and void. The Agreement will inure to the benefit of Taskrabbit, its successors and assigns. All parts of the Agreement which, by their nature, should survive the expiration or termination of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to, and notwithstanding, the expiration or termination of the Agreement or your use of the Platform.\n\nThe Agreement, in whole and in part, is drawn up in English. In case of discrepancies between the English text version of the Agreement (in whole or in part) and any translation of the Agreement, the English version shall prevail.\n\n24.Jurisdiction-specific Provisions, including Dispute Resolution.\n\nThe terms in this Section apply to Users in the noted jurisdictions. To the extent that there are any discrepancies or inconsistencies between these Global Terms of Service and the following jurisdiction-specific provisions, the jurisdiction-specific provisions shall prevail, govern and control with respect to Users in those jurisdictions.\n\nA.Residents of the United States of America.\n\nI.Dispute Resolution - Arbitration Agreement.\n\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY — IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND GOVERNS HOW YOU AND TASKRABBIT CAN BRING CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THIS SECTION WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU AND TASKRABBIT TO SUBMIT CLAIMS TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.\n\nBY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE, WITHOUT LIMITATION OR QUALIFICATION, TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT AND YOU ACCEPT ALL OF ITS TERMS.\n\n(a)Agreement to Binding Arbitration\n\nIN EXCHANGE FOR THE BENEFITS OF THE SPEEDY, ECONOMICAL, AND IMPARTIAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE OF ARBITRATION, YOU AND TASKRABBIT MUTUALLY AGREE TO WAIVE YOUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RESOLUTION OF ALL DISPUTES OR CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN A COURT OF LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES BY BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AS SET FORTH HEREIN.\n\nThis agreement to arbitrate (“Arbitration Agreement”) is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and survives the termination of the Agreement and your relationship with Taskrabbit.\n\nTo the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and Taskrabbit agree to arbitrate any and all disputes and claims (the “Claim(s)”) relating to, arising from or regarding your use of the Platform, your relationship with Taskrabbit, Tasks, or the Agreement (including previous versions), including Claims by Taskrabbit, Claims against Taskrabbit and Claims against Taskrabbit’s Affiliates (including its parent company).\n\nTo the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, this includes, but is not limited to, claims related to payments, any city, county, state or federal wage and hour law, compensation, meal or rest breaks, expense reimbursement, wrongful termination, discrimination, harassment, retaliation, fraud, defamation, trade secrets, unfair competition, personal injury, property damage or loss, emotional distress, any promotions or offers made by Taskrabbit, or the threatened or actual suspension or deactivation of your account; breach of any express or implied contract or breach of any express or implied covenant; claims arising under federal or state consumer protection laws; claims arising under antitrust laws; claims arising under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act; claims arising under the Fair Labor Standards Act, Civil Rights Act, Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Americans With Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (except for individual claims for employee benefits under any benefit plan sponsored by Taskrabbit and covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or funded by insurance), and state or local statutes, if any, addressing the same or similar subject matters; and all other federal, state or local statutory and common law claims.\n\nIf there is a dispute about the arbitrability of any claim (including about the formation, scope, applicability, interpretation, validity, and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement), you and Taskrabbit agree that this threshold dispute shall be resolved by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below. To the extent that any third-party beneficiary to this Agreement brings claims against a party, those claims shall also be subject to this Arbitration Agreement. If either party brings both arbitrable and non-arbitrable claims in the same action or related actions, both agree that the non-arbitrable claims shall be stayed until the conclusion of the arbitration, to the fullest extent permitted by law.\n\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND TASKRABBIT ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS, UNLESS EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO REQUIRE ARBITRATION OF EVERY CLAIM OR DISPUTE THAT CAN LAWFULLY BE ARBITRATED, EXCEPT THOSE CLAIMS AND DISPUTES THAT, BY THE TERMS OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, ARE EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED FROM THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE.\n\n(b)Prohibition of Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\n\nExcept as otherwise required under applicable law, you and Taskrabbit agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Claim between Taskrabbit (and/or, if applicable, its Affiliates) and you individually. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND TASKRABBIT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, OR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (“Class Action Waiver”). Further, unless both you and Taskrabbit otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Class Action Waiver shall not apply to California Private Attorney General Act Claims, which are addressed separately below.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which: (i) the Claim is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (ii) there is a final judicial determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable as to any Claims, then those Claims shall be severed from any remaining Claims and may remain in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other Claims to the fullest extent possible.\n\n(c)Representative PAGA Waiver\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, to the fullest extent allowed by law: (1) you and Taskrabbit agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the California Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”), California Labor Code § 2698 et seq., in any court or in arbitration, and (2) for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under PAGA, both you and Taskrabbit agree that any such Claim shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law) (collectively, “Representative PAGA Waiver”).\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of this representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall be severed from the Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration Agreement or the requirement that any remaining Claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (iii) any such representative PAGA or other representative private attorneys general act Claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Claims to be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims, the parties agree that court litigation of those Claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.\n\n(d)Rules and Logistics Governing Arbitration\n\nIn order to initiate arbitration, a claim must be filed with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and the written Demand for Arbitration (available at www.adr.org) must be provided to the other party. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the AAA Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated and modified by the terms set forth in the Agreement, and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if requested by you and if proper based on the facts and circumstances of the Claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select a different set of AAA Rules. You and Taskrabbit agree that the arbitration shall be administered before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, and if the parties cannot agree within 30 days after names of potential arbitrators have been proposed, then by a single arbitrator who is chosen by the AAA.\n\nAs part of the arbitration, the parties will have the opportunity for reasonable discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim(s). The arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be available in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual Claims. The arbitrator will provide a reasoned written statement of the arbitrator’s decision, which shall explain the award given and the findings and conclusions on which the decision is based.\n\nThe arbitrator will decide the substance of all Claims in accordance with applicable law and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. Claims will be governed by their applicable statute of limitations and failure to demand arbitration within the prescribed time period shall bar the Claims as provided by law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\n\nYour arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules) subject to the following modifications:\n\n(i) If Taskrabbit initiates arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, Taskrabbit will pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees.\n\n(ii) If a Client or Tasker files a Claim in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement and the associated claim for damages does not exceed USD $10,000, Taskrabbit will pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\n\n(iii) If a Client or Tasker files a Claim in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement and the associated claim for damages exceeds USD $10,000, Taskrabbit shall pay all costs unique to arbitration (as compared to the costs of adjudicating the same claims before a court), including the regular and customary arbitration fees and expenses, and the Client or Tasker shall be responsible for contributing up to an amount equal to the filing fee that would be paid to initiate the claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which the Task was performed, unless a lower fee amount would be owed by you as required by law or the applicable AAA Rules. Any dispute as to whether a cost is unique to arbitration shall be resolved by the arbitrator. If the arbitrator finds that the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), however, then the allocation of fees will be governed by the applicable AAA Rules.\n\n(iv) Except as required by law or the applicable AAA Rules, each party shall pay its own attorneys’ fees and pay any costs that are not unique to the arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would incur if the Claim(s) were litigated in a court, such as costs to subpoena witnesses and/or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.).\n\n(v) At the conclusion of any arbitration, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees and costs or any portion thereof to the prevailing party, to the extent authorized by applicable law or the applicable AAA Rules.\n\nUnless you and Taskrabbit agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings with a Tasker will take place remotely or in the county of the Tasker’s billing address, and any arbitration hearings with a Client will take place remotely or in the county in which the Client received Task services. If AAA arbitration is unavailable in your county and the parties wish to proceed with an in-person hearing, the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available location for a AAA arbitration.\n\n(e)Exceptions to Arbitration\n\nThe Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of claims:\n\nClaims for workers’ compensation, disability insurance and unemployment insurance benefits;\n\nSmall claims actions that are within the scope of small claims court jurisdiction and brought on an individual basis;\n\nApplications for provisional remedies, preliminary injunctions, and temporary restraining orders relating to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights;\n\nRepresentative action brought on behalf of others under PAGA or other private attorney general acts, to the extent the representative PAGA Waiver in Section 24(A)(I)(c) is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction under applicable law not preempted by the FAA; and\n\nClaims that have been expressly excluded from mandatory arbitration by the Federal Arbitration Act or a governing law not preempted by the FAA.\n\nNothing in this Arbitration Agreement prevents you from making a report to or filing a claim or charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Labor, Securities Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board, or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, or a similar local, state or federal agency, and nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill the party’s obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration. The Agreement and Arbitration Agreement do not prevent you from participating in an investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by this Arbitration Agreement and do not prevent you from receiving an award for information provided to any government agencies.\n\n(f)Severability\n\nIn addition to the severability provisions in subsections (b) and (c), in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable under applicable law not preempted by the FAA, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.\n\n(g)Opt Out of Arbitration Agreement\n\nFor Taskers, you may opt out of the requirement to arbitrate if you have not previously agreed to an arbitration provision in Taskrabbit’s Terms of Service where you had the opportunity to opt out of the requirement to arbitrate. If you have previously agreed to such an arbitration provision, you may opt out of any revisions to your prior arbitration agreement made by this version of the arbitration agreement in the manner specified below, but opting out of this arbitration agreement has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with Taskrabbit.\n\nExcept as specified in this arbitration agreement, if you are a Tasker, you may opt out of the Arbitration Agreement by notifying Taskrabbit in writing within 30 days of your agreement to these Terms of Service. To opt out, you must send a signed written notification to Taskrabbit, Inc., at its United States mailing address listed on its Contact Details page, available at [https://support.taskrabbit.com/hc/articles/22213175564813]. The notification must include: (i) your account username, (ii) your name, (iii) your address, (iv) your telephone number, (v) your email address, and (vi) a clear statement indicating that you wish to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement.\n\n(h)Tasker Claims in Pending Class Action\n\nIf you are a member of a putative class in a wage and hour class action lawsuit against Taskrabbit that is pending as of the effective date of these Terms of Service (a “Pending Class Action”), then this Arbitration Agreement shall not apply to your claims in that particular class action. Instead, your claims in that Pending Class Action shall continue to be governed by the arbitration provisions contained in the applicable Agreement that you accepted prior to the Agreement’s effective date.\n\nII.Telephone Communications and Agreement to be Contacted.\n\nYou acknowledge that by providing your telephone number, you expressly consent and agree to receive calls or text messages, including by manual dialing and/or using an automated telephone dialing system, from Taskrabbit and Affiliates, or from independent contractors (including Taskers) related to your account, registration, onboarding, upcoming or scheduled Tasks, changes and updates, service outages, follow ups to any push notifications delivered through our mobile application, any transaction with Taskrabbit, and/or your relationship with Taskrabbit, even if your telephone number is registered on any state or federal Do Not Call list.

      "# [Leah Solivan: Founder of TaskRabbit on 2025-02-03](https://karagoldin.com/podcasts/leah-solivan/)\nKara Goldin 0:00\n\nI am unwilling to give up that I will start over from scratch as many times as it takes to get where I want to be. I want to be you. Just want to make sure you will get knocked down. But just make sure you don’t get knocked out, knocked out. So your only choice should be go focus on what you can control. Control. Hi everyone, and welcome to the Kara Goldin show. Join me each week for inspiring conversations with some of the world’s greatest leaders. We’ll talk with founders, entrepreneurs, CEOs and really, some of the most interesting people of our time. Can’t wait to get started. Let’s go. Let’s go. Hi everyone, and welcome back to the Kara Goldin show. Super, super excited to have our next guest. We have Leah Solivan, who is the founder of TaskRabbit. And if you have not used TaskRabbit, you must, must, must. I absolutely love this company. In fact, my daughter, who’s now living in Brooklyn, needed to pick up some items in Providence, Rhode Island, and the first thing I thought of was TaskRabbit, go on there and see if you can make it happen. And she did. So. I thank you. Leah, you’re a true pioneer who’s transformed not only the future of tasks, but also the future of work with this creation back in 2008 and really laid the foundation, I believe, for the gig economy as we know it today. It’s in international also 44 cities overall, and successfully led the company to its acquisition by IKEA in 2017 now Leah is channeling her passion for innovation into supporting founders by a general partner role at fuel capital, so I’m super excited to talk about any And all of this. So welcome, Leah, how are you love it?\n\nLeah Solivan 2:03\n\nI’m well, Kara, thanks so much for having me. And cheers to you. I’ve got my favorite hint here.\n\nKara Goldin 2:08\n\nWoo hoo. I love it right here with you so, so talk to us about what inspired you to create TaskRabbit, and maybe give kind of a definition of TaskRabbit for those who might not be familiar with it. Okay,\n\nLeah Solivan 2:23\n\ngreat. So it’s back in 2008 I was an engineer at IBM. I I love technology. I’m an engineer. I never went to business school. I know how to code. I know how to build things. And in 2008 the iPhone had just come out, and mobile technology was becoming, you know, really pervasive. Facebook was just breaking out of the college scene, becoming more mainstream. And then all of a sudden, because we were carrying around these mobile devices, we were able to use location awareness. And so as an engineer, I became obsessed with these three technologies, social, location and mobile. And I was out of dog food one night, and it was cold and it was snowing outside. I was living in Boston at the time, and this is like February of 2008 and I thought, There’s got to be a way to get this dog food. And the engineer in me, just on the spot came up with the concept for TaskRabbit, and I actually originally named the company run my aaron.com because of the very first thing I thought of and I bought the domain on the spot that night on GoDaddy. It was like 699 and, you know, pun intended, it snowballed from there, and so it started in Boston, and TaskRabbit is an app. You can find it on your mobile devices and on the web, and it allows you to connect with other people in your neighborhood and your vicinity to just help get small jobs and tasks done.\n\nKara Goldin 3:57\n\nThat’s amazing. So 2008 awesome year to be starting a company. Yeah, right\n\nLeah Solivan 4:06\n\ntime to quit my job. Yeah,\n\nKara Goldin 4:09\n\nexactly. And so what was the first thing that you did when you thought, Okay, I’ve got something here. What did you do next?\n\nLeah Solivan 4:18\n\nWell, I was still working at IBM at the time, but I started coding it up nights and weekends and talking to anyone who had listened to me. Literally, I’d ride the bus into the city of Boston, and I would chat with people on the bus. Hey, do you have someone that runs errands? How much would you pay to get your laundry picked up? You know, coffee shops. I met this whole moms group in this coffee shop in Charlestown. It was 900 moms in one square mile city of Boston, and I ended up actually building the first site for that moms group. It was a closed beta test, 900 moms, and I just listened to. What they needed, what their needs were. And I went out and I found taskers, task rabbits. I vetted them and interviewed them myself, met them all for coffee the first time, 30 minute coffee meetings. Picked the best, you know, 20 task rabbits I could find to start the service. And then, and then went from there,\n\nKara Goldin 5:19\n\nwhen you were picking these task rabbits. I mean, what were these people doing beforehand that you were picking? How did you recruit them? Well,\n\nLeah Solivan 5:27\n\nKara, it was, it was a crazy time, right? You mentioned 2008 so it was the great recession. You know, I quit my job in June of 2008 had the idea. In February, quit my job at IBM by June, built the first version of the site, got it launched with this moms group in the fall, like in September, right when the stock market was crashing and, you know, we were falling into a recession. And so it ended up being the perfect time to launch this type of business, because people were looking for work they were being laid off. I mean, these taskers were lawyers, they were teachers, they had professional careers and had just been laid off. I couldn’t believe it. And so I originally just posted an ad on Craigslist and started meeting people, and I was like, Oh my gosh. Like, this is so necessary. Like, the future of work is changing, and this platform is necessary. So\n\nKara Goldin 6:24\n\nanything from picking up product in another city to building something, you know, what is the craziest task that someone has ever posted on the site that you that you’ve learned about.\n\nLeah Solivan 6:42\n\nYeah, well, it’s kind of fascinating, because from day one, Ikea furniture assembly was always the number one job on task climate. So it was inevitable that someday, 10 years later, we were going to sell to IKEA. But along the way, there were definitely some really crazy, funny, strange tasks, including a woman in Chicago who dropped her keys in the lake and hired a TaskRabbit with scuba gear to dive down and find the keys in the lake for her. And he did. So there you go. I don’t know that\n\nKara Goldin 7:19\n\nis that is hysterical. So, oh my gosh, that is so funny. So you were acquired by IKEA, as you mentioned, in 2017 How did you know it was the right move, outside of the fact that you had people signing on to build furniture? I mean, did you think about, should we grow more? I mean, what was kind of the point where you were like, Okay, should we really be doing this? Now, I\n\nLeah Solivan 7:47\n\nknow. I mean, in Kara, it’s one of those decisions I continue to look back on as a founder, and I always feel like, Man, there was so much more to do. Like, did I leave something on the table? Like, I Yes, there was more to do. There was more to build. But I think that the compelling thing about IKEA, and what has played out is that they had this international, global footprint. And my aspiration was to build a global company and a global brand. They have kept the brand intact, which honestly, to this day, I walk into an IKEA store and I’ll see the task, grab it brand. I’d be like, oh, like, it just it just like, feels nice that they’ve kept it. And to see the ability to roll out in many other countries, you know, Spain and the UK and Germany. I mean, that is something that for us would have taken so much capital to raise, and IKEA was such a great strategic partner, and we had already proved that, you know, it was a complimentary business. And so in the end, it did make a lot of sense to go through with that acquisition. Did\n\nKara Goldin 8:56\n\nyou stay on for a period of time with the company? Or what exactly happened?\n\nLeah Solivan 9:01\n\nOkay, so our mutual friend who’s amazing, Stacy brown Philpott, at the time, I had promoted her to be CEO, and she was running the day to day for the last year before we were acquired. I was chair of the board. And so when the acquisition offer came in, and we as a board were assessing it. Part of the deal is that Stacy would stay on for three years at IKEA and help through the transition. But I as the chair of the board was done, like I just I was done, and so that was okay with me. I was, you know, good with that, and Stacy’s incredible, and she did stay on through the three years and transition everyone. And we now have another CEO, another female CEO. TaskRabbit has had three female CEOs in a row, and I asked Smith is the third, and she continues to run the business internally, and was hired by IKEA to do that.\n\nKara Goldin 9:57\n\nAnd so have you stayed in. Involved. Obviously, you moved off of the board. But have you stayed involved to some extent?\n\nLeah Solivan 10:04\n\nYou know, I don’t have any sort of financial tie to TaskRabbit any longer, but I, you know, am certainly, I know Anaya and we’re, we’re all in YPO together, actually, Stacy and myself as well. And, you know, actually, just recently, with the tragedies happening in LA with the wildfires, I contacted and I and I said, let’s get some task rabbits with vans, and let’s have them drive donations down. And we did. And so, you know, I had a, you know, donation hub at my house in the South Bay and had a Tasker, one of my favorite taskers, with a huge white van, who just took loads and loads of donations south to LA and so, I mean, it’s moments like that, actually, where I feel still really connected to what I built in the business, because I see how much of a difference it can make? Yeah,\n\nKara Goldin 11:03\n\ndefinitely, yes. So you took some time off, a little bit of time off, and then you went into actually talk, talk about fuel capital a little bit. And how did that actually happen? What was the transition all about?\n\nLeah Solivan 11:19\n\nSo when we sold TaskRabbit to IKEA, I was pregnant with my second child, and I have four children, but I was pregnant with my second and I took about a year in between, had the baby kind of regrouped, and through that sort of, quote, unquote maternity leave, I started talking to venture capital firms, and I got pulled in that direction by a lot of different people and friends over the years, who I had met, who I had pitched to, but I wasn’t sure if that’s what I wanted to do next, and so I spent about a year kind of exploring that. What would that be like? What’s the day to day like? Would I like it? Would I not like? Would I be good at it or not, I don’t know. And I ultimately decided I love helping entrepreneurs. I love enabling others. I mean, that’s part of the TaskRabbit mission as well enabling others to do their best work, right? And so it became very clear that this would be a natural transition for me to go into venture and help back amazing founders and teams and companies. And I have loved it. So I’ve been at fuel capital now since 2017 and we invest at the earliest stages, sort of pre seed and seed across all sectors of technology. So my passion is definitely in consumer and marketplaces, but we’ve invested in SaaS companies and infrastructure companies, etc, and it’s just the dream, and it’s just so interesting. And I’m sure, sure this may resonate with you too, from him, like, as a founder, you feel like what you’ve built is so tied to your identity, like it was very difficult for me to sell the company and be like, Okay, well, what, what do I do now? Like, it’s been 10 years of my life and like I am TaskRabbit, right? And so what I’ve realized now is, with some time and space, and, you know, a whole nother career, that TaskRabbit really enabled me to become the investor I am today, and that feels great, because I have the empathy, like I understand what these founders are going through. I feel like it’s really helped me identify strong teams and visions and product market fit in a way that I wouldn’t be able to if I hadn’t founded my and built my own company? Yeah, definitely,\n\nKara Goldin 13:41\n\nwhen somebody comes in the door and and has founded a company. I mean, is there a formula for figuring out that this person can actually do it? I mean, I always say that, you know, the actual product or service is so key, but it’s also about the people, and can the people actually execute an idea as a dime a dozen? But what do you are there any tools you use to figure this out that you could share? I\n\nLeah Solivan 14:13\n\nmean, it’s a great question, and, you know, we invest at the earliest stages, so there’s not always a lot of data. Usually there isn’t. There’s no revenue. There’s, you know, not a lot of metrics to go off of. And so it is about what I call the founder market fit. Is this the team? Is this, the founder that is purpose built for this particular business, and why is that like when a founder walks in the room to tell me about their company, I first want to hear about them. What is their background, where did they grow up? How did that influence them? Like, why are they sitting in front of me today pitching this particular business? I think all of that really matters, because, as you know, it is not a straight line to success. There are. Lots of ups and downs, and, you know, the majority of startups fail because they hit roadblocks, they hit walls, and they don’t know how to go through them or around them or figure out different paths. And so you really have to, I like to bet on the founders that I feel like are really going to push through in those moments that seem impossible. So\n\nKara Goldin 15:25\n\nit probably depends to some extent on what the company is. But team, of course, this is also so critical. Before you invest, what do you want to see in a company outside of the founder?\n\nLeah Solivan 15:39\n\nI really want to see a balanced team. And so, you know, the founder or co founders can come from, you know, different areas, different skill sets, but I want to see a well rounded team. I was a technologist. I was an engineer. I did not have a business background or a finance background or marketing background. I had to build that team around me, and so seeing a team walk through the door that has been curated, highly curated by the CEO, by the founder, and people that are better than you like being able to hire people that are better than you with no ego, with no sort of, like, oh, I want to be at the top. No, like, I want to see give me a great team with a solid founder, and then experts, you know, across other areas. I mean, I think that shows just alignment around success and building a great business.\n\nKara Goldin 16:40\n\nSo you’ve invested in just a couple of the companies, figma and Flexport. What excited you about both of those companies? You\n\nLeah Solivan 16:49\n\nknow, those companies were in fund one, actually, those both were examples of my partner, Chris, who he invested in both figma and Flexport early I came in sort of after that, and a couple of companies that I invested in it, and I’m super excited about one is called Picasso, which is second home marketplace, so it makes sort of vacationing more accessible. You know, we have a share that we bought of a house in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and so we’ll go there for all the kids, you know, school vacations and spring breaks, and we can leave stuff there, particularly with children. It’s been very, very helpful. Another company that I really, really love is a company called upwards. We were the first money into this company, and it’s a childcare marketplace, so it kind of hits all the notes around for me, consumer based marketplace focused on children, and this founder, Jessica, is just outstanding. And so there’s been a lot of companies across all kinds of different sectors. I’ll name one more that I’m just obsessed with right now, because I know you’re friends with him too, which is Eric Ryan at CAST cast jewelry. And he is just a mastermind, literally a mastermind. He did method soap, Oli vitamins, welly bandages, and now he has cast jewelry. And so we partnered up with Eric when he was raising his seed round, and it’s been really exciting to see the growth there too.\n\nKara Goldin 18:22\n\nI’m excited about that company as well. So you’ve talked about the importance of embracing risk. Can you share a time when taking a risk really paid off in your career, whether that was while you were inside of TaskRabbit or another time.\n\nLeah Solivan 18:43\n\nI mean, there were, there were so many times that I, being an entrepreneur, is taking risks on a daily basis. I think one time that stands out, that was really scary and really painful was when we had $20 million in the bank, and I still decided to lay off 30% of the team. It was terrible. It was embarrassing. I felt like a failure, but the burn had gotten out of control. The company got too big, too fast, and I had to right size things. And it really came along with reshaping the product and being able to launch a strong mobile product, and not just web. And so I needed to bring down the burn and kind of reorganize the team and hire more mobile engineers and less web engineers. And it restructure everything. It was a terrible transition, and in the end, it is what paid off, got us to profitability, got us the partnership with IKEA, and ultimately, you know, got us the the acquisition outcome. But in that moment, I did not know if it was going to work. That’s,\n\nKara Goldin 19:56\n\nI mean, it’s a brave thing to do that, right? I. I’ve I’ve experienced it ourself, and it’s definitely a super, super brave but scary thing. You’re hopeful, but you also have to play it out and learn from your own experiences. So TaskRabbit was a game changer in the gig economy. Did you know that you were creating an entirely new category when you were actually creating that company? No,\n\nLeah Solivan 20:23\n\nI did not, but not, not immediately, but because of the timing, because we were hitting the Great Recession, as I mentioned, and then coming out of that, it was clear that we had hit a wave, a transition that was happening, and we were a big part of forming the gig economy, along with Lyft and Uber and Airbnb and get around and Turo and all the others, right? I mean, it’s, it’s, it’s not an accident that all of these companies started in the sort of 2008 2009 time frame. It’s because the technology had shifted, the recession had hit, and everything was changing underneath us. And so that’s how the gig economy formed. And I didn’t see it immediately, but I’d say by 2010 2011 when people started really focusing in on, this is the sharing economy, this is the gig economy, I was like, Oh, wow, it is, and we’re a big part of that. Yeah. So\n\nKara Goldin 21:36\n\nyou talked about some of the companies that you’ve invested in that you’re most excited about, if you you get pitched on a number of deals. This is a crazy time for so many to be raising money as well. But you’ve done consumer tech to education marketplaces, lots of incredible companies, and seen a lot of different things. Is there a particular sector that you’re super excited about right now that you think has really played you know what people want to invest to that? I mean, AI probably is an obvious one. What else have you really seen has really taken off\n\nLeah Solivan 22:20\n\nwell, I mean, here’s an a non obvious, sort of contrarian view, which is, right now most venture capitalists will not touch consumer deals, and that is the time to invest in consumer deals, right? I mean, it’s like, you know, the majority of venture capitalists, they’re kind of like herd animals, they kind of like follow each other in the back, right? And a lot of these firms are restructuring their getting rid of their consumer focused investors and investments, which is just such a bad call. I mean, these things go in cycles like now is the time to be digging deep in consumer, of course, AI, of course, AI is changing everything. It’s like the dawn of the internet. Like it is one of those, right, like, major technology shifts that will touch everything. But, you know, I’m, I’m frustrated with the majority of venture capitalists right now that are abandoning consumer but I’m also sort of excited and delighted to be able to fill that gap and really understand consumer trends and see that this is the opportunity where the big companies are going to be started and built And the highest returns are going to be made.\n\nKara Goldin 23:42\n\nSo what do you tell your founders? Obviously, you’re doing early stage, and then often, in order to grow, they need some additional capital. I mean, what do you tell them? What kind of advice?\n\nLeah Solivan 23:55\n\nYeah, conserve cash. You cannot run this like you would in 2012 2013 you need to be super scrappy. You keep your burn down, you figure out ways to make money immediately. You have to play a different game today than you would have 10 years ago. You just do. And there are still great consumer investors at Series A, Series B, beyond but I mean, it is so much harder. Valuations are a lot lower, which I don’t think is a bad thing. When I raised money for TaskRabbit, my first round was done a million dollars on a $4 million post, okay, that was 2008 pricing. That was average, normal, right? Like so, things got way out of hand, and I think valuations now have sort of come down. They’re settling out. And I just think you have to be really disciplined and strategic about how you build your brand today.\n\nKara Goldin 24:57\n\nWhen what advice do you give to. To founders or or potentially CEOs if they ask for your advice on when do you sell?\n\nLeah Solivan 25:10\n\nThat is a tough question. It’s a really hard question. You know, I think you sell when you don’t need to for one. And for us, it was nice having a strategic partnership and a business development deal in place before we sold because we understood who we were selling to and what that was going to look like on the other side, there were no surprises to this day. I mean, years later, it’s very much what I imagined it would be. You know, sometimes I think there are, there are opportunistic sales that occur. And I would say you can’t, you can’t plan for those like, you just have to build your business heads down and do the best that you can do, create some partnerships, be talking to people, all of those things, but really focus on the building piece. Because in the end, that’s what’s gonna matter. I mean, you’re gonna be priced on a multiple of revenue. So like, get as much revenue as you can? Yeah,\n\nKara Goldin 26:22\n\ndefinitely. And if you’re not growing, you know, you’ve got to really figure out why, yes, pretty quickly, definitely. So you are on a number of boards. You’ve been on boards, you are helping probably build boards as well. When you look at the best, most highly functioning boards, what would you say, I guess, to any founder who’s building a board, but also to people who are kind of in your position helping to build those boards? Yeah.\n\nLeah Solivan 27:00\n\nI mean, I’ve been on a number of private company boards. I joined a public board last summer as well. That I’m really enjoying a bunch of nonprofit boards as well. And I think the key theme, as I look across all of those is just a diversity in voice experience, skill set, and a deep, deep respect for the CEO and management team. You know, the healthiest boards really have strong CEOs that they trust. They’re not in the weeds. They’re not digging in. It’s really up to the CEO and the management team to be executing. And the board becomes sort of this, you know, advice, sounding board update, like, those are the best boards. You You really don’t want to be building a board or be on a board where you’re doing a lot of heavy lifting, because that is not the role of the board. And that can get really, really tricky. And I think sometimes for me, I find it to be a really great skill to have been an operator, to have been a CEO, and to now be serving on boards, because I kind of understand that dynamic. I understand the pressure the CEO feels in a board meeting, and I’m very sort of cognizant and empathetic to the CEO. But I think a lot of times, operators can just dive too deep into the weeds as well with questions or like, oh, you should do this or advice and expect it to be done. And so I think really understanding what the role of a board is is also important, definitely.\n\nKara Goldin 28:34\n\nSo one piece of advice you give to entrepreneurs who maybe have a great idea that they’re thinking about launching, and kind of knowing what you know today about launching, like I said before, not just a company, but entirely new category, which we did at hint as well. I absolutely did that. That is something that I think you don’t take lightly. And what would you say to that? Though?\n\nLeah Solivan 29:09\n\nWell, when I think about myself, I found a Task Rabbit when I was 28 and I had no idea what I was doing. And I think a lot of times people can overthink things. And I think the best advice I could give to my 28 year old self would be, don’t overthink it, just go for it. Like just try it. Iterate, gather data. Be fast, be agile, evolve, change, adapts like is. That is the nature of entrepreneurship, and it’s not perfect. It’s not perfection, and it never will be, and so just try, just take that first little step to get it out there and build from there.",
      "# [Taskrabbit CEO Talks About The Evolution Of Gig Economy Companies by Megan Poinski on 2024-04-07](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/04/07/taskrabbit-ceo-talks-about-the-evolution-of-gig-economy-companies/)\nThis is the published version of Forbes’ CEO newsletter, which offers the latest news for today's and tomorrow's business leaders and decision makers. Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every Sunday.\n\nDisney’s current leadership made some magic happen last week, though not the kind usually linked to the company. At its annual shareholders meeting, Disney was able to ward off pushes to elect new board members from two activist investor groups—Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management and Blackwells Capital—and maintain its existing slate of 12 board members.\n\nThe hedge funds each put forward slates of nominees who pledged to take Disney down a new path. Trian was looking for Disney to address recent declines in its earnings, while Blackwells was interested in breaking the mega-company into three smaller entities: sports, entertainment and experiences. And while these both represent valid paths forward for Disney, many observers predicted the rebuffing the activist investors received. After all, Disney’s share price rebounded more than 45% during the last six months following the reinstatement of CEO Bob Iger, delivering strong quarterly results and a cost-cutting plan. An optimistic analyst note from UBS last week also projected the company’s streaming services will break even this year and be a significant source of future revenue.\n\nAlthough Disney won this round, activist investors and proxy wars aren’t going away. Trian had mounted a similar campaign against Disney’s leadership last year, with Peltz throwing in the towel after saying Disney had done what the firm wanted, and placing faith in Iger’s then-recent return to the CEO position. From Disney’s perspective, the company was fortunate this time because Iger’s business moves were beginning to bear fruit in the run-up to the shareholder meeting, as well as the opportune timing of the optimistic analyst’s note.\n\nHowever, it can be argued that even though Trian didn’t win any spots on Disney’s board, the firm got what it wanted, which is the whole point of an activist investor campaign. In a statement issued after the meeting, Trian said they were disappointed with the election results, but “proud of the impact we have had in refocusing this Company on value creation and good governance. Since we re-engaged with the Company in late 2023, Disney has announced a host of new operating initiatives and capital improvement plans.”\n\nSprawling mega-companies like Disney represent one portion of the business landscape, but different businesses have vastly different models. Marketplace companies built on individual contractors renting their skills, homes or goods are also a powerful force today. Taskrabbit CEO Ania Smith, who previously held high-level jobs at marketplace giants Uber and Airbnb, talked to me about the evolution of that space. An excerpt from our interview is later in this newsletter.\n\nHUMAN CAPITAL\n\nLast week had both good and bad news for workers. The good news: The U.S. added more jobs than expected in March—a grand total of 303,000, according to a report from the U.S. Labor Department. This moved the unemployment rate to 3.8%, extending the longest streak of unemployment below 4% since the 1960s, and beat analysts’ predictions of the number of jobs added. Hourly earnings also rose 4.1% from March 2023 to last month, keeping ahead of inflation and matching analysts’ projections.\n\nEven though so many jobs were added, March was the worst month for layoffs since January 2023. U.S. employers cut 90,309 jobs last month, according to a report from outplacement and career services firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas. More than a third were federal government job cuts in the U.S. Army and Veterans Affairs department. More than 250,000 total jobs were eliminated in the first quarter of 2024, with the tech sector seeing the deepest cuts, losing 42,442 jobs.\n\nWhat does this mean? Although job cuts are increasing, job growth is also red hot—and outpacing the losses. In Challenger, Gray and Christmas’s analysis, the largest number of layoffs was attributed to cost-cutting. As many businesses and investors are optimistic about growth through eventual interest rate cuts and new initiatives made possible by technology and AI, perhaps the need to cut costs will slow down.\n\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n\nGenerative AI has the potential to add capabilities to a wide range of industries, but developments in medicine and health care were on full display last week. The FDA cleared two AI-powered tools for clinical use: An algorithm developed by the Mayo Clinic and digital stethoscope maker Eko Health that can detect the heart ineffectively pumping blood—an early sign of heart disease—and a software tool that can use data to detect sepsis developed by AI company Prenosis. Those who developed the Eko Health algorithm told Forbes’ Alex Knapp that these applications can significantly affect patient outcomes. “These tools are incredibly powerful — they help us screen for conditions for which we have treatments,” said Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Chair Paul Friedman.\n\nIn general, many business AI applications involve intelligent chatbots, and a study published last week showed they can also be helpful in a healthcare setting. A Northwestern Medicine study in JAMA Network found ChatGPT was able to respond to questions about radiation oncology as well or better than trained professionals. The AI system was asked 115 common questions about radiation therapy or chemotherapy, and its answers were scored by three radiation oncologists and three radiation physicists. The only concern with the AI-generated responses flagged by the study was that some used complex medical jargon and may be difficult to understand. The study said this is an early indicator that AI could be a first line for patient information about cancer treatment—and help reduce workloads and burnout rates for physicians specializing in the disease.\n\nNOTABLE NEWS\n\nProgress toward gender equality in the C-suite has fallen for the first time in two decades, according to a report published last month by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The firm, which has tracked women’s representation in C-suite positions since 2005, found 11.8% of these jobs were held by women in 2023. This is down from 12.2% in 2022, and represents the first time there has been a decrease in this metric. One of the reasons may be less corporate emphasis on gender diversity. S&P looked at mentions of the issue in earnings calls, and found 2023 had the least mentions of the issue since 2012. Forbes contributor Soulaima Gourani writes this study should be a wake-up call for organizations to reassess their commitment to gender diversity, since diverse leadership teams are proven to bring greater creativity, resilience and financial performance.\n\nTOMORROW’S TRENDS\n\nTaskrabbit CEO Ania Smith On The Evolution Of Marketplace Companies\n\nAnia Smith built her career in diverse businesses. She’s held senior positions at companies with traditional employees, including Expedia and Walmart, and nine years ago made a switch to marketplace businesses, where the service employees are gig workers. She worked with Airbnb and Uber before becoming Taskrabbit’s CEO in August 2020. I talked to her about her work with marketplace companies and how today’s economy has impacted the business. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.\n\nWhy have you wanted to keep working with marketplace companies?\n\nSmith: I didn’t wake up one day and go, ‘Oh, I want to go work in the gig economy space.’ What I did think about is I love travel as an industry, and so when I got a call from Airbnb, I thought, oh yes, I want to go back to travel because it's an amazing space to be in. Fairly quickly I realized…what made Airbnb so much different is the gig economy piece of it, meaning all of our hosts who were just everyday people looking to rent out their space. My role was to help to work with our hosts, and that became extremely motivating, because I started thinking not only about why they come and what motivates them to come to our site.\n\nWhether it’s for Airbnb, or couriers at Uber Eats, or taskers here at Taskrabbit, what I started thinking a lot about is how incredible it is that we live in an era where this is normal. Where 60 to 70 million people are doing some sort of side gig, and how I wish that these types of platforms would have existed two or three decades ago because I immigrated here from Poland, and my parents had to work a lot to make ends meet in traditional roles. You have to then deal with schedules, and you never could get enough hours. …It was just very hard, especially while they were raising two young kids. It would have been great to have any of these platforms available then, so they could use that opportunity to make that extra, meaningful income in a way that allowed them to do that with flexibility and with autonomy and with allowing them to figure out what their pricing is.\n\nI meet taskers all day, every day, and it’s really motivating to understand the impact that we're having on their lives. We just met with some taskers last week. This tasker’s a firefighter, but has really decided to lean in on TV mounting and some other skills, and she is really happy with the ability to make that extra income while she has her other job.\n\nYou’ve been at the helm of Taskrabbit through the Covid-19 pandemic, the great resignation and high inflation. Through all of that, how have things changed?\n\nAll this is happening quite fast, and more and more people are searching for that flexibility and autonomy, which means our tasker population has continued to grow at really high rates. For the first time, we have to start thinking about [whether there] are perhaps too many taskers in a metro area. …We’ve been focused on trying to manage both sides of the marketplace so that as we have more taskers coming on board who want to help, we also want to have as many new customers come on board who need that help. Because at the end of the day, that’s the crux of managing the marketplace.\n\nIt is very quantitative and very analytical, and there are many things that we can do as a company that helps to optimize both the demand and the supply side of the business. We do that by thinking a lot about locations: Do we have enough taskers in certain zip codes? Or maybe we do have enough taskers, but they all know how to do cleaning or yard work, and not enough of them know how to assemble furniture. So maybe perhaps we need to go out and tell our story more and make sure that we get more taskers who can assemble furniture. Or maybe in another location. …There’s also pricing and timing and so on.\n\nWe do that every day, and use a lot of machine learning and a lot of smart technologies to help us to think about how to optimize the marketplace so that it’s the best experience for both our taskers and our clients. Because at the end of the day, what we don’t want is our clients coming to our app and looking for someone to help them with yard work, and seeing that there is no one there who can do it. Or maybe there are people who can do it, but not for another two weeks. At the same time, we don’t want taskers signing up and just waiting for jobs and not getting any. They count on us to make that income.\n\nHow has public perception and use of marketplace companies changed in the nine years you’ve been involved with them?\n\nWhen these companies were launching, it was so new and took a lot of money and a lot of financing from venture funds to build the market, because it didn’t quite exist. And then we went through this whole phase of Uber for everything. I think over time, the acceptance has grown as customers have realized the ease and the convenience of using some of these services. On the supply side, hosts and drivers and couriers and taskers have really learned to lean in and use these platforms to help them…to feel a lot more independent.\n\nThen the pandemic hit, and I think that just turbo-charged the entire business. It was explosive growth for all of these main platforms for a variety of reasons. How we really evolved our thinking on travel and what we wanted to do, how we evolved thinking about delivery, and how we evolved thinking about having more flexibility. How we think about our time today is very different. It’s become more precious and people, I think, are more open to outsourcing some tasks that allow them to have more time to spend with their families, or spend on their hobbies. I think this area is only going to continue to grow.\n\nFACTS + COMMENTS\n\nTesla is scrapping plans to build low-cost electric vehicles, Reuters reported Friday, and instead plans to put more resources into creating robotaxis.

      "# [I'm a retiree who assembles furniture on Taskrabbit to avoid draining my retirement fund. At 79, I also like having structure and meeting new people. by Perri Ormont Blumberg on 2024-12-16](https://www.businessinsider.com/supplement-retirement-savings-doing-tasks-taskrabbit-retiree-2024-12)\nDan Weiss, 79, earns up to $47 an hour on Taskrabbit assembling furniture in Minnesota.\n\nWeiss, a retired mortgage manager, joined Taskrabbit in 2021 for both the income and the structure.\n\nHe completes tasks almost daily, earning $3,000 to $5,000 monthly and supplementing his retirement.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dan Weiss, a 79-year-old Tasker on Taskrabbit in Oakdale, Minnesota. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI joined Taskrabbit in 2021 and have completed nearly 1,200 tasks at around $47 per hour for my services in Ikea furniture and general furniture assembly in and around Minneapolis.\n\nI have a bachelor's degree in business administration and management and two master's degrees. Before I retired in November 2014, I managed several residential mortgage branches for a major bank.\n\nRetirement was fine initially, but I quickly realized I needed to add structure to my life. Now, I fill my days building furniture, meeting new people, and supplementing my retirement income.\n\nGoing from 100 mph to 0 was a very abrupt change for me\n\nOne can only do so much gardening and reading without feeling unfulfilled.\n\nI stayed \"retired\" for about six months and then had to find something that gave me more enjoyment and provided additional income to avoid chipping away at all of my retirement savings, which I began saving for in my mid-40s.\n\nBefore Taskrabbit, my other part-time jobs included stints at Costco, customer-service work, and driving for Uber and Lyft.\n\nI read an article in my local newspaper about a young woman who had discovered Taskrabbit. It intrigued me, so I immediately went online to create a Tasker account and have them run a background check on me. That was completed in a matter of days, and I was ready to go.\n\nRelated stories\n\nI've now been Tasking for 3 years\n\nI've always enjoyed assembling things, but there was a learning curve. Although I had previously worked with Ikea furniture, there was much to figure out about some of the \"tricks\" associated with Ikea products.\n\nI made over $47,000 in 2023, my highest year in earnings yet. I average $3,000 to $5,000 in earnings monthly. I could live on my retirement savings if I had to, but my Taskrabbit income helps.\n\nI do tasks almost daily\n\nI complete one to three tasks daily, averaging about four to five days a week. Most of my tasks are no more than a half hour away, but I spend a fair amount of time driving. I can expense the mileage and gas.\n\nMy time spent with clients is highly enjoyable. I meet people from all walks of life and find their stories interesting. I enjoy this aspect of tasking the most.\n\nI've realized how fulfilling and also challenging retirement can be\n\nThe lack of structure and income flow in retirement is challenging. We're told to save, save, save for retirement, and that's what I did. When I made the change from saving to spending, I was mind-blown. It didn't feel comfortable or natural.\n\nTaskrabbit has allowed me to continue to generate income while also providing structure and allowing me to maintain contact with a variety of people.\n\nI've discovered the importance of superb reviews in growing my business\n\nWhen I was young, there were no such things as digital reviews. Today, they're critical because everyone checks them before booking a service or going to a restaurant. I secure generally excellent reviews by doing the following steps:\n\nAlways communicate openly with your client. Confirm the date and time and set expectations in advance.\n\nArrive on time or slightly early. If you will be late, even by a few minutes, it's important to let them know.\n\nUpon arriving, be friendly and cordial. A handshake usually gets things off to a good start to establish a line of trust.\n\nBe efficient and ensure the task is completed properly and precisely. Having the correct tools is also mandatory for this aspect of the task.\n\nIf there are problems such as missing or defective parts, let the client know as soon as possible and provide suggestions on how to remedy the problem so as not to add stress to their plate.\n\nThank them for the work opportunity and share how they can save you as a favorite for future tasks, leave a review, and, if they choose, tip you, which happens about 25% to 40% of the time. I'm very focused during the actual task, but if the client engages me in conversation or has questions, I stop and focus on them.\n\nI expect to continue to task as long as the compensation is commensurate with the job\n\nI will continue to do this as long as my body holds up.\n\nTasking has given me both fulfillment and help funding trips and vacations. My wife and I love Maui and intend to return soon.\n\nI'm still in the planning phase of deciding on our next vacation destination. There are many other places that we wish to visit while we're still healthy and relatively mobile.\n\nAre you a retiree with a side hustle who wants to share your story?

      "# [Taskrabbit Competitors: 8 Alternatives for Lead Generation](https://www.servicetitan.com/blog/taskrabbit-competitors)\nTaskrabbit is an online marketplace and mobile app where consumers can find local service providers for jobs such as handyman tasks and yard work. For some home services contractors (in particular, independent contractors or small businesses), the app can be an option for finding leads.\n\nBut Taskrabbit tends to be used more for one-off tasks, like furniture assembly or moving, rather than providing loyal customers who return to you time and again for their plumbing or HVAC services. That’s why many home service providers look for Taskrabbit competitors.\n\nIn this post, we’ll cover 8 websites that are like Taskrabbit.\n\nIn addition, we’ll explain how our software solution, ServiceTitan, offers alternative ways to attract potential customers, track leads, and convert them into actual booked jobs where customers are more likely to stay with you long-term.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Taskrabbit?\n\n8 Taskrabbit alternatives\n\nHow ServiceTitan helps you generate leads & book jobs\n\nWhat is Taskrabbit?\n\nTaskrabbit is a site that matches handy people and contractors (known as “Taskers”) with consumers searching for particular home services in their local area.\n\nWhile it was started for handy people looking for extra money in the gig economy, Taskrabbit offers a whopping 50 categories of services in seven main areas:\n\nAssembly\n\nMounting\n\nMoving\n\nCleaning\n\nOutdoor help\n\nHome repairs\n\nPainting\n\nFor a registration fee of $25 (applicable in eligible cities you register with), you can sign up for the categories that apply to your business in your specific location(s). Taskrabbit will ask you to confirm your identity and to submit any business verifications, if required. Once you’ve completed your profile, you can set up your weekly availability including opting in for same-day jobs, if you wish.\n\nYour profile details (including skill set, hourly rate and any reviews from past customers using the platform) can be viewed by local clients searching the site for your services. Taskrabbit’s user-friendly mobile app (compatible with iOS and Android) lets you chat with prospective clients and manage and track jobs as well as payments. Contractors can submit invoices via Taskrabbit and get paid through the app’s secure payment system.\n\nAlthough Taskrabbit includes home services like plumbing and electrical work, it focuses more on one-off tasks and odd jobs, like fixing a leaky faucet or mending a light fitting. So, while it could be a useful source for small businesses and independent contractors just starting out — or to make extra income during the slow season — it typically isn’t very effective for finding long-term, loyal customers wanting more heavyweight home services, like an A/C installation or a bathroom refit, for example.\n\nFor those, you need to have solid fundamental business practices in place (like the ability to track and measure all of your marketing channels and to deliver outstanding customer service) along with the ability to deploy more established marketing activities (like email campaigns and Google Local Services Ads).\n\nThat’s where our software solution, ServiceTitan, can help.\n\nFirst, here’s our list of eight stand-out Taskrabbit alternatives.\n\n8 Best Taskrabbit Alternatives\n\nCare.com\n\nHandy\n\nJobble\n\nNextdoor\n\nPorch\n\nTalkLocal\n\nThumbtack\n\nWonolo\n\n1. Care.com\n\nCare.com is a site that’s predominantly used to help people find babysitters, housekeepers, and caregivers for the elderly. But it also has a small section for hiring people for errands and odd jobs, like general home repairs and maintenance.\n\nThe advantage of using this Taskrabbit competitor is the jobs generally pay well, but not without an upfront investment. To see and apply for local jobs, service providers have to become Premium Members. With a Premium Membership, providers rank higher, get job alerts faster, and are able to more easily communicate with potential clients.\n\nGiven the extremely small portion of this app devoted to home services, the value of that investment will probably depend on what mobile apps people tend to use in your area for home repair and maintenance jobs.\n\nDo more research on Care.com, its pricing, and how potential customers tend to use it before committing to the upgraded membership package.\n\n2. Handy\n\nHandy offers plenty of services through their website or app — users can book anything from home cleaning and general home maintenance to full-blown home improvement renovations.\n\nHandy conducts background checks, and service providers must be approved before taking on jobs. They must have paid experience, be authorized to work in the county they’re located in, and have great customer service skills. Once a service provider is approved, Handy will begin to send leads.\n\nThis handyman app boasts a 60-second booking process, so once you’re signed up and approved, leads could come in very quickly.\n\nHandy is available in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.\n\n3. Jobble\n\nJobble bills itself as the number one on-demand job app in the U.S. It’s hard to verify the accuracy of that statement, but one thing’s for sure: It’s a great place to pick up new clients.\n\nAlthough Jobble isn’t as focused on home services as Taskrabbit, users can view job listings in their area for free. After creating a profile, users can also apply to jobs without paying anything upfront.\n\nThis app doesn’t cater to residential needs and would instead be a good place to do some B2B work, like becoming the preferred plumber for an office complex, depending on the user’s area of expertise and the jobs available in their area.\n\n4. Nextdoor\n\nAn app aimed at connecting communities, Nextdoor is the world’s largest neighborhood social community networking service. It’s a great way to help spread important information and for local professionals to connect with potential clients in home improvement, landscaping, lawn care, and other home services.\n\nOn Nextdoor, business owners can create a listing for their business and encourage community members to use and review their services. Businesses can also participate in local conversations and connect with residents who need their services.\n\nAgain, this is a social website first and a lead generator second, so it shouldn’t be the primary means to find new clients. But it’s not to be ignored, either.\n\n5. Porch\n\nPorch is an industry-leader for handyman apps, with an excellent platform that includes moving assistance, painting, electrical, lawn care, furniture assembly, and other part-time local services.\n\nWhat’s great about this app is that it’s provider-driven. “Pros” (as they’re called on Porch) can set exact specifications for what type of jobs they want, and how frequently they want to buy and receive leads in the online marketplace.\n\nThis app also incentivizes quality for their pros. They offer a “Vetted Pros” program that includes a 5% discount on leads when purchased on demand. Vetted Pros also receive automatic lead credits when they meet the outreach requirements, yet don’t connect with homeowners.\n\n6. TalkLocal\n\nPrimarily focused on handyman services, TalkLocal includes a few types of jobs-for-hire you might not expect, including legal, landscaping, and office furniture rental.\n\nThis handyman app offers service provider assistance on a level most others don’t. TalkLocal makes initial contact with users and coordinates job logistics, without you having to do a thing. You have the option to accept each job individually, but TalkLocal remains the point of contact for the users. Depending on how hands-on you like to be, this could be a great feature.\n\nThe app takes its service a step further by requiring service providers to only pay for leads they’ve booked.\n\n7. Thumbtack\n\nWhether users want to find a wedding planner or a welder, chances are they’ll find them on Thumbtack. This app features over 500 service categories across a wide range of industries and covers all 50 states.\n\nAs a service provider, you’ll like how this app offers geolocation to show users which providers are in their area. Thumbtack seamlessly enables professionals to market themselves as individuals or as local businesses.\n\nThis handyman app is free to join, and service providers can set preferences for where, when, and how they want to work so you only receive the leads you really want. And there’s no shortage of leads on Thumbtack — the app generates more than 30,000 leads per day.\n\n8. Wonolo\n\nAlthough not specifically geared toward handyman services, Wonolo is still a useful resource to establish new relationships with potential long-term clients. The growing staffing company is available in more than 30 cities in the United States.\n\nWonolo users have to be 18 years old, and they also must have a Social Security number. This could be a barrier to those without one or who do not wish to share their information. But a clear benefit is the ease of use, which makes it comparable to Taskrabbit.\n\nServiceTitan Helps Home Service Businesses Generate Leads & Book Jobs\n\nUsing Taskrabbit (or any of the other apps like Taskrabbit) could bring your service business a few one-off jobs and/or may be useful for filling in gaps during slow seasons. But to secure a solid pipeline of leads that results in booked jobs, repeat business, and a loyal customer base, you should have these five business fundamentals in place:\n\nUse tried-and-true marketing practices like email marketing, Google Local Services Ads, and direct mail — all trusted lead generators.\n\nEnsure you can convert leads into actual booked jobs with a reliable and repeatable call booking process.\n\nThe ability to track leads from all marketing channels so you can measure results and analyze what’s really working (and what’s not).\n\nAn efficient way to optimize customer reviews so that they help drive customers to your business.\n\nDeliver awesome customer service from beginning to end so your customers return to you time and again and recommend you to their friends.\n\nWe built our software, ServiceTitan, with tools to help home service professionals (like HVAC, plumbers, electricians, and landscaping businesses) do all of this. Here’s how it works.\n\nUse Tried-and-True Marketing Methods\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, Taskrabbit may generate a few leads for small, one-off jobs. But using tried-and-true marketing methods like email marketing and direct mail are deployed by many service businesses for one reason — they usually drive more highly qualified leads to your business than apps like Taskrabbit.\n\nIn addition, managing customer reviews won’t be an issue until you have a steady stream of incoming leads.\n\nServiceTitan’s Marketing Pro has been designed to help home services companies deliver tried-and-true marketing campaigns that will bring you more business. Here’s how:\n\nDeliver Hyper-Targeted Email Marketing\n\nTargeted email campaigns are among the most effective ways to attract business, earning $40 for every $1 spent. Aside from being a low-cost marketing channel (there’s no incremental cost of sending emails), marketing to people who already know you is more effective than “converting” strangers (from apps like Taskrabbit) so it’s a sound method of generating more work for your business.\n\nServiceTitan's email marketing feature allows you to send hyper-targeted email campaigns by segmenting your email audience by ZIP code, age of equipment, date of last service, new homeowner, and more. Using data already collected in ServiceTitan, you can target previous customers with a “We Miss You!” email campaign, follow up with existing customers on unsold estimates, or offer a discount to new homeowners.\n\nSending targeted emails with ServiceTitan is simple. Choose from our huge range of email templates, adjust the text to fit your campaign, and deliver to your chosen audience.\n\nYou can monitor the performance of your email campaigns via the ServiceTitan marketing scorecard.\n\nLeverage Direct Mail\n\nLikewise, using traditional direct mail to attract business from your local community works well for many service businesses.\n\nSeviceTitan’s Marketing Pro lets you automate direct mail campaigns that attract business in your local area. Choose from our library of postcards and send out a single postcard, or thousands, and pay a flat fee per item.\n\nAs with the email campaigns, you can select your audience from your customer lists — for example, those who have equipment that’s due to be updated — and send them a postcard reminding them of your equipment replacement services. Upload your chosen design, adjust the text, print, and mail to your selected audience.\n\nYou can track the results of your direct mail campaigns via the ServiceTitan dashboard and see which ones are driving revenue.\n\nDrive More Leads with Google Local Services Ads\n\nGoogle Local Services Ads are a cost-effective way to drive leads to your business, and ServiceTitan’s Google Ads integration simplifies the entire process.\n\nBuying Google Local Services Ads increases the likelihood of your business appearing at the top of the Google search results page, above the PPC ads and organic listings. This means potential customers can view a snapshot of your business — such as your company name, Google review rating, and years in business — to determine whether your company fits their needs.\n\nCosts for Google Local Services Ads vary, but you only pay when a customer contacts your business through the ad. This cuts down on job leads from customers who are simply price-shopping.\n\nServiceTitan integrates with Google Local Services Ads to allow homeowners to directly schedule online appointments with your company, and provides business owners with ROI metrics on every campaign. This makes the whole process easier for the customer and improves the chances of them booking an appointment with your company.\n\nConvert Leads into Actual Bookings\n\nWhichever marketing channels you choose to generate leads, it’s critical to convert those leads into actual booked jobs when those customers contact your business.\n\nProviding your CSRs (customer service reps) with a clear, repeatable process for when customers call your company, is a good way to achieve that repeatability and increases the chance of them making a booking.\n\nServiceTitan’s call booking software helps CSRs provide a polished customer experience as soon as they answer the phone. Our software shows them who’s calling (if they are an existing customer) so they can greet them by name, which sets up the entire call on a friendly, open basis. Whether they are an existing customer or a potential one, CSRs can use our customized prompts to ask the right questions and ensure they get all the information your techs will need quickly and efficiently.\n\nHaving an efficient call booking process in place ensures customers (new or existing) are given a stellar experience from the first moment they call your business.\n\nTrack & Measure All Marketing Channels\n\nAn issue with using apps like Taskrabbit is that when you choose to expand your marketing to several channels (like the ones we recommend above), it’s difficult to know where your leads are coming from when customers contact your business, and which ones translate into actual jobs. You need software that tracks and analyzes each one.\n\nServiceTitan helps you make informed decisions on which marketing activities to focus on (whether that’s Taskrabbit, Taskrabbit alternatives, or channels like email marketing or direct mail). Our software offers campaign tracking telephone numbers and real-time ROI reporting for all your marketing campaigns.\n\nFor each campaign, you can track the number of calls, how many jobs you booked from those calls, and the number of sales made from those jobs, all from your ServiceTitan dashboard.\n\nWith ServiceTitan, you can view your metrics via our marketing scorecard, which shows your current marketing campaigns (email, direct mail, Google Local Services Ads, etc.) and ties all new customers to the specific marketing campaign that brought them to you.\n\nBecause the scorecard ranks all your marketing channels by revenue, you know exactly how much business you’re getting for every dollar you spend so you can boost spending on campaigns with higher returns and drop channels with poor performance.\n\nOptimize Customer Reviews\n\nIn our experience, and that of the thousands of home service businesses that use ServiceTitan, managing and replying to your customer reviews (good or bad) is critical to your business, because customers place a great deal of importance on them when choosing a service provider. Not only does this apply to the reviews that you’ll receive on Taskrabbit (if you choose to use it) but also other online platforms such as Google, Yelp, and Angi.\n\nHowever, managing reviews is often a task that slips to the bottom of the to-do list, simply because it’s time-consuming and tedious, especially when the reviews are in several different places.\n\nServiceTitan’s Marketing Pro helps make this process more efficient by collecting reviews from all of your platforms so you can manage and reply within ServiceTitan.\n\nOur software helps:\n\nGenerate more reviews with automated requests: ServiceTitan sends out survey requests via text or email as soon as a job has been completed. This encourages customers to share their experience while it’s still fresh in their minds.\n\nConsolidate all your reviews in one place: Set up alerts so you can read and respond to reviews from all your review platforms (Yelp, Google Reviews, and apps like Taskrabbit), directly from the ServiceTitan dashboard. This saves time because there’s no need to go into each review site individually and customers receive responses more quickly.\n\nTrack and match reviews to specific techs & jobs: Because all your review data is stored centrally within ServiceTitan, you can see exactly what’s working and what’s not, and use these insights to reward or coach individuals.\n\nKeep review listings consistent and updated: There’s no need to frequently check and update company listings on apps like Taskrabbit because ServiceTitan ensures your company details are accurately listed across 60+ business listing sites. This means search engines will correctly attribute them to you and customers can easily find you. You can try our free listings scan tool here.\n\nDeliver Awesome Customer Service\n\nWithout a doubt, delivering awesome customer service right from the first point of contact through to the delivery and billing of your services is the most important way to attract customers and grow your service business.\n\nTravis Ringe of ProSkill Services, a $14 million full-service home services company in Arizona with more than 5,000 5-star Google reviews, explains that his CSRs and techs go above and beyond by always offering to do more, such as providing ladder service to help elderly customers change lightbulbs or smoke detector batteries, or simply bringing the trash can from the curb.\n\nNot only does this increase the probability of your customers using you again, but they’re also more likely to recommend your services to their friends and family.\n\nIn addition to our call booking tool, ServiceTitan also helps you deliver exceptional customer service with these features:\n\nScheduling and dispatching features that match the right technician to the right job and ensure they arrive on time.\n\nAutomated texts that confirm appointment times and provide customers with links to their tech and a GPS tracker so they know who is coming and when.\n\nEstimate and proposal templates that techs can build while on a job and show to customers via a mobile app.\n\nCustomer financing to help customers choose what’s best for their budget.\n\nPayment processing tools with flexible and convenient payment options for customers.\n\nAnd more!\n\nAll of these tools are fully integrated and communicate with each other so you never have to spend time transferring information from elsewhere.\n\nReady to Generate More Leads with ServiceTitan?\n\nApps like Taskrabbit might be useful for generating one-time jobs if you’re a small business with a limited marketing budget or if you’re just starting out. But using software like ServiceTitan to execute tried-and-true marketing campaigns (like email and direct mail) as well as track leads from all of your marketing channels and convert them into actual booked jobs will attract loyal customers who return to you time and again.",
      "# [Taskrabbit Side Hustle Earns Over $70k a Month: How to Start by Amanda Breen on 2024-11-15](https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/taskrabbit-side-hustle-earns-over-70k-a-month-how-to-start/482724)\nWant to start a side hustle? More than half (54%) of Americans already have one, according to research from MarketWatch, but choosing one out of so many options can be overwhelming.\n\nTo keep it simple, plenty of side hustlers capitalize on skills they already have: cleaning, furniture assembly, TV mounting and just about anything in between.\n\nRelated: This Former Ph.D. Student Started a Side Hustle to Graduate Without Debt — Now He Makes $30,000 a Month and Can Complete a Job in 15 Minutes\n\nOf course, starting a business from scratch isn't easy, which is why many gig workers use third-party platforms, such as Thumbtack or Taskrabbit, to market their services and connect with customers.\n\nEntrepreneur spoke with three people who built successful side hustles with Taskrabbit: Tom Saar, a former Starbucks employee with a moving business; Emely Cepeda, a dental student who offers cleaning and organizing services; and Dan Weiss, a retiree who assembles furniture.\n\nRelated: How to Start a Multi-Million Dollar Company, According to an IBM Engineer Turned Founder\n\nRead on to learn more about their journeys and secrets to success on the platform:\n\nTom Saar runs a moving business with Taskrabbit\n\nIn late 2020, Saar moved from Sweden to the U.S. to pursue a computer science education. Saar settled in New York City and immediately noticed the abundance of moving trucks. After some research into the moving process revealed common pain points for customers, Saar saw an opportunity to start a business that did it better.\n\nRelated: This Former Starbucks Employee Started a Side Hustle That's Making More Than $70,000 a Month — and He's Not Done Yet\n\nSaar joined various gig platforms to offer his moving services to customers, but Taskrabbit proved particularly lucrative: As of June 2024, Sarr had completed more than 1,000 tasks on the platform in partnership with other taskers and earned over $70,000 in gross revenue during April alone.\n\nSaar's success tip: \"Communication with your clients should be high on the list of things to become more effective at. Clients don't want to be kept in the dark. If you're running late to an appointment, keep them informed. If something goes wrong, be generous with refunds or compensation. This builds strong customer relationships. Lastly, don't be afraid to fail. Failures are inevitable, but how you take responsibility for them and learn from them will set you apart and help you grow.\"\n\nEmely Cepeda cleans and organizes with Taskrabbit\n\nCepeda was in her second year as a full-time dental student when she started looking for ways to earn extra money — and found Taskrabbit in August 2022. She wanted a gig that was flexible and without monthly quotas so she could focus on her courseload, and the platform provided just that.\n\nRelated: This 26-Year-Old Dental Student Spent $25 to Start a Side Hustle That Can Earn $500 for Just a Few Hours of Work: 'There Is Nothing More Satisfying'\n\nCepeda launched her side hustle offering cleaning and organizing services on Taskrabbit. As of August 2024, Cepeda had earned more than $1,300 in one month with the side hustle — and as much as $500 a day for just a few hours of work, averaging $576 a month.\n\nCepeda's success tip: \"You can make a ton of money on Taskrabbit if you make the time and put in the work, like I have. I tend to work a lot around busy times of the year, too (like September move-ins, holiday seasons, etc.) because the need for Taskers is higher (and therefore I make more). Use your time and resources wisely, and you will be set up for success in the long run. Capitalize on the time you have and make the tasks you take worth it.\"\n\nDan Weiss assembles furniture with Taskrabbit\n\nDan Weiss, 79, managed a number of residential mortgage branches for a major bank before he retired. When he read a newspaper article about a young woman making money on Taskrabbit, he was intrigued and decided to start a side hustle assembling furniture on the platform.\n\nRelated: This 79-Year-Old Retiree's Side Hustle Earns $4,000 a Month: 'I Work as Much or as Little as I Desire'\n\nIt took about four or five months for Weiss's Taskrabbit side hustle to become profitable, but as of October 2024, he averaged $4,000 a month on the platform — all while working as much or as little as he desires.",

      "# [TaskRabbit Reviews - 695 Reviews of Taskrabbit.com on 2019-04-17](https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/taskrabbit.com)\nI needed someone for a short small move, bed, dresser a few small boxes. Would require a pickup truck and two people. Taskrabbit requires that the second person also be a Tasker. It shows the average fee to be 103.00/hr. Three screens later it reveals there is a 42 dollar \"Trust and Support fee\" Very unclear what this is for. I called their customer service line. I could barely understand the representative but he was finally able to answer my question as to whether the second Tasker was also subject to the 42.00/hr Trust and Support fee. The answer was yes. So with two Taskers at 103/hr. And two Trust and Support fees the cost was near 300.00/hr. Zero transparency. Ridiculous fees. I decided to hire a couple of lawyers to do the move instead.\n\nService\n\nValue\n\nIkea furniture: Tasker was unable to complete job on day: Ikea wardrobes left not fixed to walls: Units not fixed together: Inside rails fixed to wrong unit: Shelve fixed to wrong unit: lots of bits not used? Tasker Said he would come back however has not shown and unable to contact him: Task Rabbit support do not respond: Have emailed them 5 times and had an A I chat: Keep asking for same information; When all you want is to get job completed: Unable to use room as units not fixed to wall (unsafe) And to top that Task Rabbit has taken full payment (had to contact Bank to stop it) Pity their customer support is not as quick as Accounts Dept: Tells you all you need to know:\n\nService\n\nValue\n\nQuality\n\nRequested 1 hour of work before the available choices came up. Then chose from the selection provided. Guy asked for pics of the lawn? Then 30 minutes beforehand, he texts that the job is too small and I should get someone else to do it. I told him I was perfectly happy to pay the full hour for the 1/2 worth of work. I can't give him a review because he didn't do the job and neither can customer service for the same reason. They did, however, notify me that they would not be charging me for the service! I'm amazed!\n\nAbsolutely horrible customer service. Our person they sent not only built the ends incorrectly, causing risk of harm for my child- but they stole all the extra screws and pieces so we couldn't fix it. Then they refused to do a refund, instead offering credit to hire someone else- which I won't use because I don't trust the quality of the individual they would send. Submitting a chargeback with my bank today due to them not abiding by their own 100% happiness guarantee.\n\nService\n\nValue\n\nShipping\n\nReturns\n\nQuality\n\nWe had bought some cabinets from Ikea here in the Bonn/Cologne area, and wanted them put together for us, as we are elderly people and we felt it would be easier if someone could help us by building the cabinets from the shipped parts. We went on the confusing website, filled out forms; there is a phone number but it is in Munich, and a recorded voice says no person available to talk to. We requested help again and again, a week passed, then another week, finally we just assembled the cabinets ourselves. I don't understand how this company can stay in business. We didn't pay any money because they didn't respond to our request for help. Pfui!\n\nTip for consumers:\n\nTaskrabbits should go out of business.\n\nProducts used:\n\nWe did the task ourselves.\n\nService\n\nI've been a Tasker for Task Rabbit for several years and have always been paid out for my jobs except for my last two recent jobs I completed. It's been well past the administrative timing to make it into my account. My bank's clearance department has confirmed that they never received the funds and suggested it went to another bank account. I have spent several hours on the phone back and forth between Task Rabbit, my bank and another third party Task Rabbit referred me to call who refused to speak to me because they deal directly with Task Rabbit. Would be nice to know where my money went!\n\nOk, booked assembly through Ikea. TaskRabbit Person refused to come during a scheduled time. Came early next morning. Refused to assemble shelves. I told him he had to. Assembled them wrong. Didn't assemble a lamp. Called Ikea. IKEA contacted TaskRabbit, they actually tried to con me to rebook the service directly through them, saying I won't have to provide my credit card. However, that was not true. I refused to give them my credit card. After reading these bad reviews of theft and damage, I am just going to ask Ikea for refund for assembly.\n\nThe customer service representative from TaskRabbit lied on the phone and when asked him to provide a phone number to call him back, he gave me someone else's phone number.\n\nI am not sure what the general requirements for being a tasker on TasRabbit, but it seems to be terrible. The man came to assemble my cabinet, he ended taking hours to finish, and did a horrible job to boot. Half the doors didn't open at all, and it was completely misaligned. Attempting to reach customer service to see if I either get a refund, or to send someone competent at our way to fix it. The cabinet was nearly one thousand dollars, and ended up getting ruined. However, phone calling is completely useless, as I ended up on hold for undisclosed time before getting booted anyways. I've tried to call them multiple times to no avail. On top of that I don't get a reply to my chatbot in hours as well. 0/10 could not recommend any less.\n\nProducts used:\n\nIkea assembly\n\nService\n\nReturns\n\nQuality\n\nMy tasker was excellent. Jaala. But Taskrabbit it horrible. Their website is so very difficult to navigate with no answers and over and over and over again inputting your information and it still goes nowhere. They hold u hostage to review (says review and tip)(u MUST) and there is no where to tip. I spent 4 hrs trying to tip and there is no chat response or any answers. THEY ALSO HOLD YOUR CC HOSTAGE AND DO NOT ALLOW U TO CHANGE YOUR CARD NUMBER. Spent so much time trying and once they got your card,...they will not let u change or cancel it. WILL NEVER GO BACK TO TASKRABBIT. HORRIBLE COMPANY AND THESE ONLINE ONLY WITH NO CHAT OR NOONE TO TALK TO OR NOT COMMUNICATION OR NO ANSWERS. Cc hostage once they got it. THIS COMPANY HOLDS U HOSTAGE ONE THEY HAVE YOUR CC NUMBER. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THESE PEOPLE AND THIS COMPANY AGAIN!\n\nService\n\nValue\n\nQuality\n\nI booked someone to do a relatively small task and they messaged me a few times for specifics, but they also asked if I was flexible on scheduling. I said yes, but I wanted the task done ASAP. My request was made Friday and he said he'd schedule me for Tuesday. Monday morning, I logged in to check the status and saw the task was cancelled because he was no longer available, but I didn't get any email or text notifications. Ridiculous. So I tried booking another person and after 2 hours with no response, I cancelled the task myself because I was needing the task completed by Tuesday at the latest. Still waiting to see if Taskrabbit tries to charge me the cancellation fee even though the 2nd tasker never accepted and the first was a flake. Incredible disappointment and waste of time!\n\nService\n\nValue\n\nI got a king size bed from ikea and they arranged these scammers to install my bed. I was scheduled on Thursday, so I took off from work. At the time of the appointment, the tasker calls me to tell that he has to cancel my appointment since he is double booked and as I have pre paid the company through ikea, he will give more priority to the other client. I call the customer service but they want me to book a different appointment and also pay more money. Finally ikea booked me for Friday. Then at the time of the appointment, the new tasker again cancels my appointment and let me know he can only come on next day. Then he finally shows up on Saturday 2 hours late and it takes him 4 hours to finish 50% of the installation and suddenly tells my wife he has to leave immediately since he has a different task which is very important to him. My wife tells him to finish our task first, but he completely ignores her and leaves. Now my current status is I got my bed 1 week back and I'm still sleeping on floor. Never experienced anything like this in Canada.\n\nService\n\nValue\n\nShipping\n\nReturns\n\nQuality\n\nIf I could rate a negative I would. We tasked a mover and were in contact with him up until the day before the move. We got a text from Taskrabbit that he would be there in an hour. Not only did he NEVER show up, he never he let us know he was not. I contacted customer service and was told \"oh well he is an independent contractor so we don't have control over that\".? How about your exorbitant fees, what is that paying for then? An hour and 45 minutes after I called customer service, they sent me a text saying the job had been cancelled and to try another tasker. I clicked on that and it said there were no other taskers available. Freaked out, you bet! Nothing like scrambling to have to rent a U-haul and beg anybody we know to help carry everything and working in the dark at night because of the crazy late start. OMG serious breach of trust!\n\nWhen a tasker causes damage (large or small), TaskRabbit requires you to first file a claim with your homeowners insurance & provide proof that you've done so. Currently in the US, just about any claim against your homeowners insurance will result in either an huge jump in your rates or complete cancellation of coverage, and good luck finding new homeowners insurance. When a tasker caused damage in my home, that's what they required, so I'm forced to pay for the repair and replacement of items (including finding someone qualified to do that repair). So much for my Happiness with TaskRabbit. Then when I went into their system to give a review, suddenly I'm not able, and the tasker that was working on my shower - it now says he was doing furniture assembly! He dropped the expensive rain shower head, severely damaging it, plus damaged the handle that selects handheld or shower. I'll have to replace the entire unit (as the head itself isn't available). The unit is about $520 plus the cost of having a qualified plumber install it. (I have no proof of purchase as the folks that just remodeled had purchased it.) Preventing me from doing a review and altering what he was doing (after the fact) is definitely dishonest at best. I'll never, ever use TaskRabbit again, and I really don't recommend anyone else do so either - the risk is too high. Please read the details on their 'Happiness Pledge' and you will probably agree.\n\nProducts used:\n\nIt was supposed to be service, not products. Tasker was Grady B.\n\nService\n\nValue\n\nQuality\n\nIkea recommendation for self assembly wardrobes. The sensor light should go off when door closes...it doesn't. One handle not put on...I would need to drill hole myself to do...the worst of it he's made to holes in 2 doors by error and patched it up with white plastic dowels. Task Rabbit have offered me £38 credit to get another tasker out! What a con. Do not use at all. And I have no means of contacting the assembler as this can only be done via TR platform\n\nService\n\nValue\n\nQuality\n\nI am a professional Handyman, logging over 450 handyman jobs completed, each of the past 5 years. For Homeowners and Property Managers. I'm super qualified. I signed up on TaskRabbit, hoping to try it out for close to home local work. I listed my many skills and usual hourly wage that I charge, and get, in my market. It's been 5 weeks and not a single task request. People complain, but they really don't want a professional, they want a dummy to do professional work for peanuts. Pros cost more.\n\nTip for consumers:\n\nBe prepared to smile, chuckle and outright laugh at the reviews.\n\nProducts used:\n\nnone\n\nService\n\nValue\n\nShipping\n\nReturns\n\nQuality\n\nI asked for help in getting Wayfair upholstered furniture assembled. John H had years of experience assembling Ikea products, so he was quick to understand how to do the job. He arrived early and was very professional and fast, handling the furniture with care. The two furniture items had many pieces, and I would have found the job very difficult on my own. He cleaned up after the task and moved the pieces to their final location. I will definitely recommend John H to others and ask for his help in the future.\n\nFirst-time Task Rabbit user for Ikea bed assembly. Had to go on the site and give credit card. Bad vibe right there. After completion of \"profile\" almost instantly got a text from a guy saying \"thanks for hiring me.\" What? I asked for qualifications/experience. He seemed nice/legit enough but I just didn't like paying some total stranger to come into my house and spend four hours assembling something. I've done Ikea stuff before. I'll do it again, just for longer."

Solivan's experience as an engineer and her understanding of technology have been instrumental in shaping Taskrabbit's platform and its approach to the gig economy.\n\n### Ania Smith\n\nAnia Smith, the current CEO of Taskrabbit, has a background in marketplace companies, having held senior positions at Uber and Airbnb. She has focused on optimizing the marketplace by using data analytics and machine learning to balance supply and demand effectively. Smith noted, \"We’ve been focused on trying to manage both sides of the marketplace so that as we have more taskers coming on board who want to help, we also want to have as many new customers come on board who need that help\" [(Smith, Forbes, 2024)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/04/07/taskrabbit-ceo-talks-about-the-evolution-of-gig-economy-companies/).\n\n## User Experiences and Feedback\n\nUser experiences on Taskrabbit are mixed, with some praising the platform for its convenience and flexibility, while others express frustration with customer service and tasker reliability. For instance, Dan Weiss, a 79-year-old Tasker, shared that he enjoys the structure and social interaction that Taskrabbit provides, earning between $3,000 to $5,000 monthly [(Blumberg, Business Insider, 2024)](https://www.businessinsider.com/supplement-retirement-savings-doing-tasks-taskrabbit-retiree-2024-12). However, there are numerous complaints regarding tasker performance and customer service responsiveness, indicating areas for improvement [(Taskrabbit Reviews, 2019)](https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/taskrabbit.com).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTaskrabbit continues to be a significant player in the gig economy, leveraging its platform to connect clients with Taskers for a variety of services. The company's recent focus on emerging home aesthetic trends, strategic partnerships, and investment activity positions it well for future growth. However, addressing user feedback and enhancing customer service will be crucial for maintaining its reputation and ensuring long-term success. \n\nFor prospective candidates and investors, Taskrabbit represents an opportunity to engage with a pioneering company in the gig economy, with a strong foundation and potential for continued innovation and growth."
