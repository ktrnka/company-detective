      "# [GenSX Overview on 2025-03-19](https://www.gensx.com/docs)\nGenSX is a simple typescript framework for building complex LLM applications. It’s a workflow engine designed for building agents, chatbot APIs, and more using common patterns like RAG and reflection.\n\nIt uses jsx to define and orchestrate workflows with functional, reusable components:\n\nMost LLM frameworks are graph oriented, inspired by popular python tools like Airflow. You express nodes, edges, and a global state object for your workflow. While graph APIs are highly expressive, they are also cumbersome:\n\nBuilding a mental model and visualizing the execution of a workflow from a node/edge builder is difficult.\n\nGlobal state makes refactoring difficult.\n\nAll of this leads to low velocity when experimenting with and evolving your LLM workflows.\n\nLLM workflows are fundamentally about function composition and data flow - exactly what JSX was designed to express. There is no need for a graph DSL. GenSX expresses control flow, loops, and recursion using plain old typescript language primitives. To learn more about why GenSX uses JSX, read Why JSX?.\n\nWhile GenSX uses JSX, it does not share the same execution model as React, and has zero dependencies.\n\nReusable by default\n\nGenSX components are pure functions, depend on zero global state, and are reusable by default. Components accept props and return an output.\n\nBecause components are pure functions, they are easy to test and eval in isolation. This enables you to move quickly and experiment with the structure of your workflow.\n\nA second order benefit of reusability is that components can be shared and published to package managers like npm. If you build a functional component, you can make it available to the community - something that frameworks that depend on global state preclude by default.\n\nComposition\n\nAll GenSX components support nesting, a pattern to access component outputs via a child function. This creates a natural way to pass data between steps:\n\nThere is no need for a DSL or graph API to define the structure of your workflow. More complex patterns like cycles and agents can be encapsulated in components that use standard loops and conditionals. Typescript and JSX unifies workflow definition and execution in plain old typescript, with the ability to express all of the same patterns.\n\nVisual clarity\n\nWorkflow composition with JSX reads naturally from top to bottom like a standard programming language.\n\nContrast this with graph APIs, where you need to build a mental model of the workflow from a node/edge builder:\n\nNesting makes dependencies explicit, and it is easy to see the data flow between steps. No graph DSL required.\n\nStreaming baked in\n\nLLMs are unique in that any given call can return a stream or a prompt response, but streaming is typically applied to just the last step. You shouldn’t have to touch the innards of your components to experiment with the shape of your workflow.\n\nGenSX makes this easy to handle with StreamComponent.\n\nA single component implementation can be used in both streaming and non-streaming contexts by setting the stream prop:\n\nFrom there you can use the component in a streaming context:\n\nAnd you can use the component in a non-streaming context:\n\nDesigned for velocity\n\nThe GenSX programming model is optimized for speed of iteration in the long run.\n\nThe typical journey building an LLM application looks like:\n\nShip a prototype that uses a single LLM prompt.\n\nAdd in evals to measure progress.\n\nAdd in external context via RAG.\n\nBreak tasks down into smaller discrete LLM calls chained together to improve quality.\n\nAdd advanced patterns like reflection, and agents.\n\nExperimentation speed depends on the ability to refactor, rearrange, and inject new steps. In our experience, this is something that frameworks that revolve around global state and a graph model slow down.\n\nThe functional component model in GenSX support an iterative loop that is fast on day one through day 1000.",
      "# [Quickstart on 2025-03-19](https://www.gensx.com/docs/quickstart)\nIn this quickstart, you’ll learn how to get up and running with GenSX. GenSX is a simple typescript framework for building complex LLM applications using JSX. If you haven’t already, check out the basic concepts to learn more about how GenSX works.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore getting started, make sure you have the following:\n\nNode.js version 20 or higher installed\n\nAn OpenAI API key with access to the required models\n\nA package manager of your choice (npm , yarn , or pnpm )\n\nInstall the gensx CLI\n\nYou can install the gensx CLI using your package manager of choice:\n\nLogin to GenSX Cloud (optional)\n\nIf you want to be able to visualize your workflows and view traces, you’ll need to login to GenSX Cloud:\n\nRun the following command to log into GenSX Cloud:\n\nNow traces will automatically be saved to the cloud so you can visualize and debug workflow executions, but this step is optional and you can skip it for now if you prefer.\n\nHit enter and your browser will open the login page.\n\nOnce you’ve logged in, you’ll see the following success message:\n\nNow you’re ready to create a new workflow! Return to your terminal for the next steps.\n\nCreate a new workflow\n\nTo get started, run the following command with your package manager of choice in an empty directory. This will create a new GenSX workflow to get you started.\n\nWhen creating a new project, you’ll be prompted to select IDE rules to add to your project. These rules help AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, Cline, and Windsurf understand your GenSX project better, providing more accurate code suggestions and help.\n\nYou can also specify IDE rules directly using the --ide-rules flag:\n\nYou can also install or update these rules later using npx:\n\nThis will create a new started project, ready for you to run your first workflow:\n\nIn index.tsx, you’ll find a simple OpenAI chat completion component:\n\nThe component is executed through gensx.Workflow.run(), which processes the JSX tree from top to bottom. In this example:\n\nFirst, the OpenAIProvider component is initialized with your API key\n\nThen, the Respond component receives the userInput prop\n\nInside Respond, a ChatCompletion component is created with the specified model and messages\n\nThe result flows back up through the tree, ultimately returning the response from gpt-4o-mini.\n\nComponents in GenSX are pure functions that take props and return outputs, making them easy to test and compose. The JSX structure makes the data flow clear and explicit - each component’s output can be used by its children through standard TypeScript/JavaScript.\n\nRunning the workflow\n\nTo run the workflow, you’ll need to set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.\n\nIf you chose to log in, you can now view the trace for this run in GenSX Cloud by clicking the link:\n\nThe trace shows a flame graph of your workflow, including every component that executed with inputs and outputs.\n\nSome components will be hidden by default, but you can click the carat to expand them. Clicking on a component will show you details about it’s input props and outputs.\n\nFor longer running workflows, this view will update in real time as the workflow executes.\n\nCombining components\n\nThe example above is a simple workflow with a single component. In practice, you’ll often want to combine multiple components to create more complex workflows.\n\nComponents can be nested to create multi-step workflows with each component’s output being passed through a child function. For example, let’s define two components: a Research component that gathers information about a topic, and a Writer component that uses that information to write a blog post.\n\nNow you can combine these components using a child function:\n\nIn this example, the Research component gathers information about the topic which then passes the information to the WriteArticle component. The WriteArticle component uses that information to write an article about the topic which is then returned as the result.\n\nStreaming\n\nOne common challenge with LLM workflows is handling streaming responses. Any given LLM call can return a response as a string or as a stream of tokens. Typically you’ll want the last component of your workflow to stream the response.\n\nTo take advantage of streaming, all you need to do is update the WriteArticle component to use StreamComponent and set the stream prop to true in the ChatCompletion component.\n\nNow we can see our research step running before the write step:\n\nWhile this is nice, the real power of streaming components comes when you expand or refactor your workflow. Now you could easily add an <EditArticle> component to the workflow that streams the response to the user with minimal changes. There’s no extra plumbing needed besides removing the stream={true} prop on the WriteArticle component.\n\nNext steps\n\nNow that you’ve gone through the quickstart, you should be able to start building with GenSX. Take a look at the following examples to see how you can build more complex workflows."

      "# Post ID xhwl19: Genius / Genius-x Thoughts? with +23 score by [(Banker_dog, Reddit, 2022-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/xhwl19/genius_geniusx_thoughts/)\nCurious in the communities thoughts towards this platform.  They seem to have raised (and planning on raising more) capital through two lengthy ISPO’s, NFT sales and eventually public sales of the gens and gensx token.\n\nDo people here think it makes sense to have raised this much to deliver what muesli already has AMM order?  Is there more potential I’m not aware of. Open to thoughts and reasons why I should be bullish or shy away from them?\n\n\n\n## Comment ID ip0d3s0 with +14 score by [(jhb760, Reddit, 2022-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/xhwl19/genius_geniusx_thoughts/ip0d3s0/) (in reply to ID xhwl19):\nBeen staked in GENS1 since they started. I have a lot of faith in Lars and I am really excited to see what unique aspects of Cardano they will leverage. If anyone has been daydreaming about code running on Plutus, it's Lars.\n\nI gave MIN/SUNDAE and all the other UNI clones a go but Muesliswap, IMO, are the only team who managed to actually leverage the chain in a meaningful way. Anything really innovative was going to take some time to flesh out after smart contracts went live. \n\nThey waited because they knew what was needed for their Dapp to work. I honestly think Genius Yield is going to blow people away. I'm not gonna keep shilling but let's just say it isn't just another AMM DEX. It *will* stand out.\n\n### Comment ID ip0goa9 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/xhwl19/genius_geniusx_thoughts/ip0goa9/) (in reply to ID ip0d3s0):\nIs the Genius DEX still on track to launch on mainnet in Q4?\n\n#### Comment ID ip0khkd with +5 score by [(jhb760, Reddit, 2022-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/xhwl19/genius_geniusx_thoughts/ip0khkd/) (in reply to ID ip0goa9):\nTo the best of my knowledge!\n\n## Comment ID ip0ahge with +16 score by [(I-Like-Art-And-Drugs, Reddit, 2022-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/xhwl19/genius_geniusx_thoughts/ip0ahge/) (in reply to ID xhwl19):\nLars Brünjes is on the Genius Yield team, so I’m automatically in.

Genius plans to tackle impermanent loss through concentrated liquidity. You can learn more from their white paper.\n\nNot only that they're also going to do yield optimizing which I think is like yearn finance, and they're also launching Genius Academy which aims to educate people on how to use DeFi and more.\n\nThen there's Genius X which is a launchpad like Occam, Vent, and Cardashift. They provide not just the launchpad, but are also an accelerator program. They provide technical mentorship, connect investors, and business guidance.\n\nIf you go to the Genius X website you'll see all the services they provide to projects launching on GenX. ISPO design, business strat and product development, marketing, strategic partner connections, legal set-up, and more.\n\n## Comment ID ip1t6eg with +2 score by [(Devonshrine, Reddit, 2022-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/xhwl19/genius_geniusx_thoughts/ip1t6eg/) (in reply to ID xhwl19):\nThe only two projects I’m 100% in — Genius Yield & Liqwid Finance.

I had my suspicions about WAYA's principle idea, but all I did was forgo a few months of staking rewards so it wasn't a loss worth crying about.

Earth Nodes coordinate the network, and required 100,000WMT to be staked in order to operate. WMT is also used in air nodes, available to be staked, and also used (I believe) while using the network.\n\n> If no, what’s the “back door”?\n\nNot sure what you meant by this.\n\n## Comment ID ipy911x with +3 score by [(awenrivendell, Reddit, 2022-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/xo8p6s/who_here_is_actually_using_the_platform/ipy911x/) (in reply to ID xo8p6s):\nI use both Ethereum and Cardano but way more Cardano on almost daily basis.

      "# Post ID pmdrh5: Couples Match Tips with +92 score by [(pineapplesandPCSM, Reddit, 2021-09-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/pmdrh5/couples_match_tips/)\nThe below guide is something that my class had created a few years back. I came across it while purging my google drive this weekend. This is only one classes at one school's opinion, so take it with a grain of salt, but hopefully it will help some people out. The couples matching process is kind of mess, so good luck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A GUIDE ON HOW TO SUCCESSFULLY COUPLES MATCH** \n\n**How to Start** \n\n* Apply broadly and out of state. Especially if one or both are in a competitive specialty. \n   * PRO TIP: Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania have the most residency spots per capita. They are also the most couple friendly and DO friendly states. \n   * There are some AMAZING programs out of state. Don’t be afraid to apply and check interviews at programs out of state. \n* Choose cities/locations that are program dense. Thereby increasing your odds of not only getting interviews nearby but also matching successfully nearby.  \n* Less competitive specialties (FM, peds, IM) have more programs in larger cities, while more competitive specialties (OBGYN, SX and ROADS specialties, etc) are relegated to university/academic and/or county programs. So there will naturally be fewer of these programs; try to use this to your advantage if one of your pair is applying to a less competitive specialty\n* Keep in mind, driving 20 miles in the Greater LA/OC/SD/Bay Area/Seattle/Chicago/NY/Boston \\[insert heavily trafficked city\\] is not the same as 20 miles in the Greater Houston, Dallas, Denver, Portland, Kansas City, Detroit Area \\[insert less traffic area city here\\]. Don’t let mileage dictate how far apart your programs should be, I think the driving time is a better measure for distance apart.\n\n**Application Process** \n\n* On the ERAS application, there is a section to indicate if you are couples matching. You are NOT required to check this box to couples-match. \n   * Pro for not checking the box: Not checking the box allows you to tell programs at your discretion later if you are participating in the couples match. Many competitive specialties or programs have been known to screen out applicants who are planning on couples matching. They worry that you will not match at their program due to extenuating factors with your partner. During the interview, they will ask if your partner has received interviews near your program, and if not, if you will rank them. This is crucial if you are applying for the same competitive specialty (OB/OB, GenSX/GenSX). \n\n**Audition Rotations**  \n\n* If you are planning on applying out of state, it is helpful to do audition rotations in a program dense area for both partners. This allows the programs to understand your commitment to moving to the area. Especially in midwest states, they will want to make sure you and your partner are willing to move from California especially. \n* If your partner is planning on applying or did apply to the Hospital you are rotating at, tell your program director!! Many times the PD will talk to the partner’s PD and help get an interview for you both! Don’t be afraid of making connections.\n\n**Interviews** \n\n* If your partner has received an invite in a city you do not have one, reach out to that program or nearby programs early via phone call or email. Many programs understand the hardships of couples matching, and if you meet the minimum requirements, are more than happy to offer you an interview. (You can even mention that you’d love to coordinate your visits and travel arrangements). Of note, less competitive specialities (Family, IM) will be more successful with this then more competitive specialties. \n* If both partners are applying to the same specialty, it’s more helpful for the partner who received the interview to reach out on behalf of the other partner, as some programs are more likely to respond to an already-invited applicant.\n* If you have not checked if you are couples matching on ERAS, you will have to decide to tell the PD in your interview or not. This comes down to a judgment call, but feel out the culture of the program to determine if disclosing your match status will be beneficial or harmful.\n* During an audition rotation/ interview day, you can ask current residents (or even your interviewers) if they’ve ever had a couple match into their program to gauge if a program seems to be couple-friendly (and to find out practical things like if the couple was able to get the same vacation schedule, etc.) \n\n**Post Interview Communication**  \n\n* Many couples will write “Love Letters” to their favorite programs and let the PDs know that each partner is ranking their respective programs highly. This sometimes works, and sometimes does not. Many former MD programs do not respond to these letters, but former DO programs do. If you do not get a response back, do not be disheartened. \n\n**NRMP and Rank Order List**  \n\n* After you register for the NRMP, you will need to register as a couple. In order to do so, you will need your partner’s NRMP number. This is an additional fee around $25 for each partner. FYI you can also uncouple at any point, except for after rank lists have closed.\n* After you and your partner have ranked all combinations in which you both match nearby, you will have to decide how to rank locations far from each other, or one person matching and the other one not matching (indicated by NO MATCH for that rank # on that partner’s list). These are difficult conversations, so be thinking about them ahead of time to alleviate having to decide this at the end of the application cycle.\n\n**MATCHING and SOAPING**  \n\n* Many couples end up ranking lower on their rank list than singles in similar specialties. There are no statistics on how many contiguous ranks are needed to secure a match, but as a general rule, try to get more contiguous ranks than what is recommended for individuals.\n* If one partner matches and one does not: On Monday of match week, if one partner has to SOAP, you can call NRMP and find out the approximate location of the other partner’s match to help with SOAPING \n* Write a new personal statement for SOAPING. In your new PS, indicate that you couples matched. Programs will wonder why you didn’t match, so having a reason as to why you went unmatched in your PS will increase your chances of matching during SOAP.\n\nGood luck!!! The couples match is a complicated but definitely rewarding process! \n\n**Helpful Links**\n\nResearching programs\n\n* [https://www.medmap.io/](https://www.medmap.io/) (can look up both specialties and see how far apart programs are located)\n* [https://www.residencyexplorer.org/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=/](https://www.residencyexplorer.org/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=/) (see how competitive you are for specific programs)\n* [https://freida.ama-assn.org/Freida/](https://freida.ama-assn.org/Freida/)\n\nVideos on the process\n\n* [**http://www.nrmp.org/couples-match-videos/**](http://www.nrmp.org/couples-match-videos/)\n* [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2aJKrzYK8k**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2aJKrzYK8k)\n\nNRMP Info\n\n* [**http://www.nrmp.org/couples-in-the-match/**](http://www.nrmp.org/couples-in-the-match/)\n\nOnline rank list generator (can factor in distance as a starting point when making your lists)\n\n* [https://www.mactiontools.com/couplesmatch](https://www.mactiontools.com/couplesmatch)\n\n## Comment ID hch7xza with +18 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-09-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/pmdrh5/couples_match_tips/hch7xza/) (in reply to ID pmdrh5):\nAwesome post, thanks for sharing.\n\nI remember reading somewhere that the max amount of ranks you can have as a couple recently changed from 700 to 300.

My gf and I weren't engaged (still aren't lol) when we couples matched. If you both see yourselves together down the line then go for it. Just understand that for everyone it's a huge commitment knowing that you have better chances matching solo and there is likely sacrifice involved. \n\nNow more specifically for same-sex relationships... In my experience, I've always seen it as no different than any other couple, and I know my program does as well but I do go to a very liberal FM program in a very liberal state. I wish it were that way everywhere, but I can't promise there won't be biases elsewhere. Additionally, I'm not sure what year in med school you are in, but you'll see/hear a lot of people use the word \"partner\" on the interview trail. It's a neutral word that doesn't imply sex, gender, or sexual preference, and it's against ACGME rules for PD's and people to ask specifically about that sort of stuff as well. Ultimately, it comes down to you whether or not you choose to disclose who you are couples matching with.\n\n#### Comment ID hclck7l with +4 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/pmdrh5/couples_match_tips/hclck7l/) (in reply to ID hcjb7uc):\nThank you!

If you defer a year and don't graduate on time, programs will definitely ask why... couples matching is an answer that they're going to be fond of. That being said, if you somehow find a way to do a research year, sneak in an MBA/MPH or do an OMM fellowship (if you're into that stuff and at a DO school) and make it naturally appear that you had planned to take a year off, it's likely to be better received even if you have ulterior motives.\n\nOn the flip side, depending on the specialty and location, there is some benefit of having someone already in a certain area when applying. You can implement some of the techniques I noted above of letting programs know you're really interested if your SO is at the institution or even in the city/metro area.\n\n## Comment ID hcht1z9 with +2 score by [(omaum, Reddit, 2021-09-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/pmdrh5/couples_match_tips/hcht1z9/) (in reply to ID pmdrh5):\nThanks so much, this rocks!\n\n## Comment ID hcu3rrv with +2 score by [(koriolisah, Reddit, 2021-09-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/pmdrh5/couples_match_tips/hcu3rrv/) (in reply to ID pmdrh5):\nAdding to this season's ERAS collection\n\n## Comment ID hd5llwn with +2 score by [(usck1234, Reddit, 2021-09-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/pmdrh5/couples_match_tips/hd5llwn/) (in reply to ID pmdrh5):\nThank you for this post! any IMG couple that successfully matched?\n\n## Comment ID hfc25jh with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/pmdrh5/couples_match_tips/hfc25jh/) (in reply to ID pmdrh5):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID hfe03xb with +2 score by [(DommyBearAngel, Reddit, 2021-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/pmdrh5/couples_match_tips/hfe03xb/) (in reply to ID hfc25jh):\nI have the same question.

You can expect 600+ in neet with the same preparation. Below that I'd say you have to work a bit harder to get selected.\n\nYou don't need to get demotivated with sub-450 marks because it's you facing 45 questions from each subject revolving around a few chapters which will definitely serve you tougher questions. \n\nMarks are pretty dynamic in aiats since some students will score good in particular parts of the syllabus where they are actually good at and won't get enough if it's their weak chapters.\n\nSo I'd just say be consistent. Your actual chances will be reflected in full course tests.",

You don't have to do a fellowship to practice the full spectrum of ENT.\n* If you want to specialize, nearly all fellowships are 1 year--neurotology is 2 years, a few peds programs are 2 years, if you want to do academic head and neck some are 2+ years.... everything else (rhinology, laryngology, facial plastics) is 1 year\n* In office procedures that have good RVU per effort... a scope can reimburse as much or more than the office visit itself\n* Broad range of surgeries from microsurgery to big whacks and everything in between\n* Option to have a decent lifestyle even with a busy surgical practice\n* Surgery is cool but poop is gross.

So:\n\nIf we seem lost, it's not because we're stupid, please don't make us feel that way. \n\nIf we suggest an order that is slightly different than what you normally see, please understand that there are many ways to do the right thing and just because it isn't your way doesn't mean it's wrong. \n\nIf an attending changes our plan, don't assume we're incompetent, and don't gossip that we are (see the previous point). I've heard nurses tear a resident to shreds for not knowing how one attending wants things done, when the details had no evidence base or bearing on outcomes. Trust me, residents already feel shitty about not getting it the way their attending wants, we don't need to be kicked when were down.\n\nIf we don't remember your name we are truly sorry, we are learning so much so quickly that names don't get triaged highly.

In nursing, a great deal of emphasis is placed on experience. Those with less experience are sometimes treated dismissively or offered subtle ridicule. Some young nurses internalize this and carry the cycle to the next generation of nurses.\n\nIt's frustrating to see.\n\nBut occasionally you will express this attitude with residents and medical students. I get it. This young buck comes on to the floor and you need to show him his paces, right? But the result can be downright toxic. From passive agressive phone calls, to creating a community of gossip around a physician, to saying openly hostile and disparaging things; I've had a nurse point out a fellow resident and say, \"I can't believe she's a doctor, she's going to kill someone. I wouldn't let her touch me with a ten foot pole\". The resident (intern, really) messed up a benadryl order, which was caught by the pharmacist. I've had nurses tell me, without a hint of humor, that doctors only focus on disease and nurses care about the whole patient. I've seen nurses scold young physicians in front of patients. \n\nRemember this: how you treat physicians while they are training will heavily influence how they treat you when they are attendings.\n\nNow, these are bad apples. For every bad nurse I've met, I've dealt with ten good ones. So please do not misunderstand my post as slandering you all. I only encourage those of you who have *integrity* to speak up. Just recently a nurse saw that I was supervising an intern she didn't care for, rolled her eyes and said, \"Oh *he's* on your team tonight? He's gonna keep you busy,\" inviting me to share in ridiculing my subordinate.

They were condescending, rude, and went out of their way to make me realize that \"just because you have an MD behind the back of your name doesn't mean anything\". It's ICU nurses in particular that seem to have a huge chip on their shoulder. \n\nI know nurses have dealt with the kid fresh out of med school who is condescending and rude to them now with his slightly longer white coat. When I see that happen, I will make it a point to call out my fellow physician and let them know that type of BS won't be tolerated. I would ask that nurses hold their own accountable as well.\n\nAlso, I'd like to say something to those nurses with \"experience\" who have been doing this for 30 years. Some of you are fantastic at what you do and I couldn't do my job without you. But some of you are literally some of the most awful people I have ever met. The way you treat medical students, and new interns/residents is pretty disgusting. But even worse is how some of you treat the newer nurses. Just like experienced attendings set a bad example and ruin the culture for a program, experienced nurses can ruin the culture for nurses.\n\nSome of my favorite nurses to work with are the newer nurses, who don't get everything right the first go around, make some mistakes, but come to me with questions and I get to work with them together to take care of patients. The older nurse who has been doing this for 30 years, makes decisions on her own without consulting the rest of the team, makes disparaging comments about the residents who don't know what they are doing, and berates new nurses, are the absolute worst.\n\nTo all you nurses out there, if you think residents/interns are really dumb I encourage you to NOT work in a teaching hospital. You can be a huge part of the teaching experience and we have a lot to learn from you, but if you bring your toxic attitude to work everyday, there are other places for you to go. \n\nAnd please, please stop with the license plates that say \"I'm an RN, I save the doctors life\" or \"I'm an RN, even doctors need heroes\". It makes you look ridiculously insecure and just contributes to the \"us vs them\" mentality in healthcare which doesn't do good for patients. We are all on the same team here.\n\n#### Comment ID do1qgkg with +220 score by [(anon1268, Reddit, 2017-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/74v4nc/what_do_you_wish_nurses_knew/do1qgkg/) (in reply to ID do1k7sa):\nAs a medical student, I was working with an older, female anesthesiologist who, decades ago, graduated from my medical school.\n\nAfter speaking to one of the ICU nurses for chewing me out, she looked at me and deadpanned, \"She was a bitch 30 years ago when I was a med student, and she's still a bitch now.

I'm the 2nd most experienced nurse in my floor, and I've been a nurse for a year. We absolutely love almost all of our residents, and most of the attendings, too. The only thing that gets negative comments on our floor are residents who refuse to assess patients in person, even though they're in the hospital, or attendings who just can't be bothered. Poignant examples being a resident who ordered wrist restraints on a very mobile and agitated pt with no respiratory problems, attempting to get a psych hold on that pt without ever coming to bedside to assess, and an attending who declined to order any treatment or even a cardiac consult on an etoh withdrawal/hepatic encephalopathy pt in new onset svt at 180 with an ef of 15. The residents who seem unsure, or need to talk to fellow drs, or think a situation is stable enough to pass to day team, or who come look at the pt and say this is why I'm okay with this are the ones we trust and love to work work with, and want to help out whenever we can. \n\nEdit to clarify the situation with the resident\n\n#### Comment ID do1dujy with +98 score by [(BrobaFett, Reddit, 2017-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/74v4nc/what_do_you_wish_nurses_knew/do1dujy/) (in reply to ID do1d948):\nYour attitude sounds great, truly.\n\nAnd some of my closest friends and *teachers* are nurses. I can't begin to express the gratitude I felt when, while on the PICU, an experience nurse named Stephanie offered help, information and suggestions with the management of my patients. She was my greatest ally.\n\nYour example of physicians seeing someone reminds me of when I was on pediatric nephrology with a somewhat volatile doctor. My fellow resident and I did a good job keeping our noses to the ground and working hard, avoiding his reputation for wrath. However, during table rounds the resident answered a call (which was okay), briefly gave a verbal order for tylenol and hung up. The attending stopped his presentation and asked, \"What was that call about?\". \"Oh, the patient just needed some tylenol.\" \"Why did the patient need tylenol?\" \"He has some abdominal pain and a fever.\" I remember this tiny, terrifying chinese man stood up, pointed at the resident and said, \"Leave right now and see your patient! He has new abdominal pain and a new fever! You are not an ordering service, you are this patient's doctor! You will always see your patient before doing something.\" Kid ended up having a renal abscess following his biopsy.\n\nThe lesson was a good one and it's stuck with me ever since.\nIt's something I teach all of my junior residents.\n\n#### Comment ID do1j4p8 with +44 score by [(DocSparty, Reddit, 2017-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/74v4nc/what_do_you_wish_nurses_knew/do1j4p8/) (in reply to ID do1d948):\nI would caution that in the scenario of a resident who doesn’t come to assess a patient or puts in order like that without coming to bedside at times, sometimes there is a good reason. I know it is different everywhere, but where I work, when I cover nights I am covering nearly 80-90 floor patients as well as all consults both ED and floor. Many times I’ll get a page asking me to assess a saturated dressing or that a patient is tachycardic to 110 and I’ll do a quick chart check, maybe order a lab or an imaging study without evaluating the patient. This isn’t because I’m trying to be a bad doctor, but I may have 3 emergent consults to see and manage at once and have to triage as best I can. I can tell the nurse is frustrated with me but sometimes you have to multitask from afar. \nThat being said, when there is any indication a floor patient is decompensating, there’s no excuse for not evaluating them in person. Sometimes as residents we are stretched very thin, particularly overnight and on weekends. It may not be this way everywhere but at least this is my experience as a resident in a surgical subspecialty.\n\n### Comment ID do1mwkr with +19 score by [(cyrilspaceman, Reddit, 2017-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/74v4nc/what_do_you_wish_nurses_knew/do1mwkr/) (in reply to ID do1cgwj):\nI think that this problem might not be unique to nursing though.

Roughly 0.5mm in diameter can be ok, and this may get even more exaggerated if the room is dark, e.g. when you're giving evening doses of meds, etc. \n\nThe second consideration, since I see it come up so commonly, is that they may have a traumatic or unresponsive pupil. People who have had eye injuries, cataract surgeries, etc., often have irregularly shaped, less or non-reactive pupils.\n\nWhen a pupil actually starts to \"blow,\" it's because the brainstem is being injured somehow - the most common mode of injury is compression, likely due to swelling. And that's really the point, that we're worried about their brain and brainstem - which is to say that  blown pupils rarely happen in isolation. Usually the patient is losing their mental status rapidly, developing stroke symptoms, seizing, etc.\n\nTl;dr - if the patient is comfortable, hasn't had any gross neurological changes, and is eating their breakfast, you probably don't have to worry about their pupils being different sizes.\n\n### Comment ID do1nd4z with +122 score by [(MedicsOfAnarchy, Reddit, 2017-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/74v4nc/what_do_you_wish_nurses_knew/do1nd4z/) (in reply to ID do1c8t3):\nAnd then of course there's the Learning Experience. \n\nTaking one of my first head trauma patients to the ED as a new EMT, I noticed that his left pupil was very wide, and completely unresponsive.

Being a pharmacist we have an issue defining a “true allergy” from a side effect.  Some people put everything possible down as an allergy, but they don’t realize putting up with a side effect may be better than getting the wrong med for their condition. \n\nI’m pharmacy school I had a professor who said his dad always said he was allergic to penicillin. I think it was a minor itch, and he told his dad it wasn’t a true allergy. When his dad got older he had a heart infection and really needed to be treated with the penicillin. But he refused it because he thought he was truly allergic to it. Wouldn’t let the desensitize or anything.  Sadly because of his “allergy” My professor’s father died. Don’t know what year this happened in (guessing 80’s??), but my professor said at that time period penicillin was really the right antibiotic for the job. \n\nAnd just about any medication can make you feel “off” at first?  How many non-compliant patients come in with high bp and their home med rec has several bp meds?  Then we add another one to the home meds then the bp drops way\nlow?

Please don't refer to patients only by their room number when you are coming to tell me (or paging me) something about them. \"The patient in bed 3\" usually means nothing to me. I can have more than a dozen patients at once on wards/ICU (and much more cross covering at night), on different floors and on different wings of the hospital. I almost certainly won't know who you are referring to until you tell me their name. It really baffles me in the ICU where the nurses carry 2 patients but can't remember either of their names. I guess it's because we tend to go by patient names when discussing amongst other physicians and nurses talk about patients by room number (not that one is right or wrong).\n\n2. When a patient is complaining of pain, please ask them where the pain is before paging me. I have gotten countless pages where the nurse says \"can I get something for pain?\" and when I ask where is the pain I will either get \"I'm not sure\" or they say \"it's all over\" (I usually assume you didn't even ask when I hear that). Where the pain is and the characterization of it usually changes what kind of pain med I will give.\n\n3. If you can text page at your hospital, PLEASE do it. The younger nurses here tend to do it much more often and it saves both of us time (you don't have to wait for me to call back and I don't have to call and try to get ahold of you). It's even more annoying when there is unit clerk who handles the pages for the nurses, and then when we call back we have to wait for them to go find the nurse who told them to page us. Please remember we are getting bombarded with pages, especially at night, so it's a huge waste of time when we are sitting on hold over and over.\n\n4. Please avoid paging us for non-urgent things during our morning report and noon conferences. This is our time for education and it greatly interrupts us when we are sitting in a lecture and we get a page and have to step out, and it turns out to be \"please renew telemetry.\" My program has tried numerous times to educate the nursing staff about this, even posted notices in their work areas, but it still happens every day.\n\n5.

We also work half of the weekends, which means we get an average of 4 days off per month. That means I work over 450 hours per month, when a regular full-time job is 160 hours per month. \n\nUnnecessary 3am pages might be part of your work culture, but they are torture to us. \n\nThe best solution I've seen is having an issues board at the front desk, or an issues list on the front of the patient chart. That way you can pass to the incoming nurse that the issue has been documented for us to address in the morning, and hopefully that nurse will respect your initiative instead of thinking you're lazy. It makes me sad that nurses would call each other lazy for triaging things appropriately, when triage of care is crucial to your workflow and patient safety.\n\n#### Comment ID do1kvqu with +33 score by [(linknight, Reddit, 2017-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/74v4nc/what_do_you_wish_nurses_knew/do1kvqu/) (in reply to ID do1kazp):\nI understand where you are coming from, but it's hard not to get frustrated because we are really sleep deprived on nights. When we are on night float periods it's usually very temporary and we barely get used to the time change before we suddenly switch back to days, whereas night nurses seem to work nights long term and have a normal sleep schedule. So for those nurses a night shift is a normal day, but for us it's a constant battle to stay awake and try to function.\n\n#### Comment ID do1w1w0 with +11 score by [(shtrouble, Reddit, 2017-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/74v4nc/what_do_you_wish_nurses_knew/do1w1w0/) (in reply to ID do1kazp):\nI work in a hospital where there aren't many residents, so a culture of never paging for non emergencies developed (which has its own problems and regularly creates scares in morning prerounds when I find out about a fever nobody thought was important). Instead, nurses write an EPIC sticky note with the request and we delete the note when we take care of it.

Please try not to page overnight person with colace order, because \"this patient didn't have a BM for three days\" or because you noticed their home meds are not restarted. All those things are important but can be delt with in the morning, not at 2 AM. 3. Something new I noticed a couple years ago - not understanding that other providers are also busy even though they're not immediately at patients bedside. In other words - if somebody is not answering your page immediately - it might be because they're in a procedure, talking to the patient, otherwise occupied. Of course I know that there are people who notoriously don't answer. But giving reasonable amount of time (5-10 min) for a non urgent page to be answered I think is appropriate - vs for example writing a resident up for not responding in a timely fashion - whereas they were actually in a trauma and renewing the narcotic order could have waited a little. Reverse is also true - from MD standpoint if I put an order for catheter removal - and it's not removed immediately I understand it's because the nurse is busy.

These are people I work and interact with on a daily basis.  I get to see their stresses and successes in relation to the environments they exist in, which varies from nursing facilities to urban Level-I trauma centers to flight teams.  \n  \nSo first and foremost, I'd like nurses to know that regardless of everything else that seems to be on fire around them, they're appreciated and respected.  What I'd also like to remind nurses, is that you get what you give...regardless of what seems to be on fire.  If you're stressed and act like a jerk to people around you, regardless of how right you feel you are and how right your peers feel you are, you'll eventually get treated like a jerk down the line and earn that reputation.  Reputations are important, lasting, and difficult to change.  \n  \nFrom the transfer/IFT/CC paramedic side of things.  I wish nurses knew that I need a report.  You can't just throw patients at us and expect we're going to just sail off into the sunset.  Continuity of care exists for a reason and I need to know what you know.  I need to know why they are where they are, what changes and interventions have happened while in your care, and their history (PMHx, Rx, Allg, etc).  I need to know why they're going to the next facility.  I need to know how stable the patient is and how likely they're going to remain that way during transport.  I need to know if there are any orders that are unique to this patient which might prompt me to have a discussion a physician and/or medical control.  If you don't know these things, I need you to be willing to figure things out with me...which I can understand is time consuming when you might have no time to spare.  \n  \nI wish nurses knew that I don't work in billing, but I understand how billing works and why it's important to have some grasp of what \"medically necessary transport\" means and how it can impact the patient down the line.  I also wish you knew that \"well, the doctor wants it\" puts us in an awkward position because the people who operate the financial side of things (especially Medicare) don't care what the doctor wants, they care about whether or not there's a tangible need for the specific kind of transport that's been ordered.  In short, I wish nurses knew that an ambulance is similar to a prescription.\n  \nFrom the 911 paramedic side of things.  I wish nurses knew that our reports are valuable and important and should be treated as such.  Yes, sometimes we can get long-winded on a patient that probably didn't need to be seen in an acute setting.  But often times, we're providing you with the best initial or baseline view of the patient's condition that you're going to get right off the bat.  \n  \nI wish nurses knew that, in our world, not every patient needs an IV.  Pushing us to adhere to [\"the checklist\"](http://emsbasics.com/2014/07/19/murder-by-checklist/) is detrimental to patient care because medics become more concerned with \"the checklist\" than they are with the patient's overall condition and maintaining appropriate interventions.  \n  \nI wish nurses knew that the patient isn't there because of us.  Trust me, I didn't want to respond at 3:30am for the patient with foot pain after twisting their ankle 3 weeks ago.  It is what it is.  \n  \nLastly, I wish nurses knew that we aren't competing with them and the nurse vs medic rivalry needs to end.  We serve different purposes and operate in different venues.  Both of us want to see our peers succeed and be respected as a profession.  We won't get those things while butting heads with each other over things that ultimately don't matter.\n\n### Comment ID do2ofht with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2017-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/74v4nc/what_do_you_wish_nurses_knew/do2ofht/) (in reply to ID do1pk9h):\nNurse/paramedic rivalry just jumped a notch here because paramedics moved up in pay to band 6, and nurses stayed at band 5.

This is going to seem like a rambling rant, but tonight I’m just spewing stuff off the top of my head. I’m a believer that everyone should team up together to do what’s best for the patient.  We may quivel over a missing drug, but we will get it to you. Pharmacists are a source of j formation, and that gets lost sometimes. We are here not to make your job harder, but to try to get the meds to the patient. The words I’ve written below are more of an FYI than anything. We both work in different departments, but we have to work together to make sure the patient is taken care of. \n\nSide note: Looking at this I’be written a super huge long note. Not intentional. Just stuff I’ve picked up over the years as a tech and now pharmacist. \n\nWhen a person has a random vanc level due but you don’t see an order for vanc, please call the pharmacy before just canceling it. Even though we have “pharmacy to dose vanc” placeholders on the MAR this seems to happen often. Also check the high levels before calling the doc to see if the lab was drawn correctly. If the vanc is already running and then the phlebotomist comes in to obtain the blood, it’s going to be high. And with the little bit of time MDs are able to glance at the chart, they may take that level as a trough and change therapy because of it. \n\nWe really don’t know what happened to the medication we sent. Sometimes we really have tubed it twice and don’t know why you still don’t have it. And please don’t be offended if we send the technician for it. Some of these medications cost $100’s to $1000’s of dollars, we want to be good steward of our resources. \n\nIf a new TPN is ordered during the day, it will be sent up with that evenings round of TPNs. (for us it is 5pm). There is generally an order to run D10 until the patient gets the TPN. Also sometimes we have to wait until the PICC team gets the line in before we will make it. I’ve seen therapy delayed for a day because of the vein access. \n\nSome questions about Epic we can’t answer.  Epic is basically several unit specific systems working together as one. We don’t have access to some screens that nursing does.  Also if an order needs to be put in or a Beacon plan needs entered, I need you to jump off of the chart. Keeping the chart open on certain pages locks it up for other users. I can usually throw orders and plans in pretty quickly, but I do need access to the chart. Also runs of potassium that say q1h X however many runs, we can’t retime those orders. They can be done manually by you, but for ya to do it we have to reject the order completely and put it back in. Then it looks like the patient got the original order plus the second order when glancing at a chart. \n\nIn Epic Nursing communications are not considered a legal pharmacy order (at least in my state.). Also pharmacy does not see such orders to act upon them.  \n\nWhen calling down to get a med verified, give the room number and the patient’s name.  On our system the verification screen does not give room numbers so if this message is passed along I have to stop what I’m doing, pull up the census, figure out the patient, then jump through the list to verify the orders. \n\n\nIf using Epic and a med is on trigger fill (i.e, epidurals, etc) Please don’t wait until they run out to call for another one. They take time to prepare, and some of us are battling drug shortages. There is nothing like pulling up 50 mL\nof fentanyl in a syringe when all that is available is 2 mL vials. \n\nIf a patient has transferred floors since the cart full, their medication may still be on that floor. Some departments are more notorious than others for not sending them along, but redispensing 15 medications when we will get them back to put back in the bin is double the work. \n\nIf an Epic message has been sent down for a redispense, there is no need to call as well.  If it has been a while, then give us a call. It’s actually easier to do the redispense from the Epic message than from taking the phone call. Also not all IVs are refrigerated. If there is a cabinet where the large volumes go, little piggybacks can get lost in there. \n\nWith USP 797 making IVs requires us to wear a lot of garb (shoe covers, bonnet, gown, etc.). Stock may be limited to only items that are compounded in the pharmacy. If something is rarely used sand on our rolling shelf, we have to call to the central pharmacy to grab it for us.  There may be a delay. \n\nChemo is not a milkshake!  It can’t be done very quickly, and some meds take “forever” to dissolve. When making chemo not only do we have to wear the regular stuff for the IV room, but we have to put a second gown on as well.  Putting on sterile gloves over another pair of gloves takes a few minutes.  We have closed system devices that allow us to make chemo without using a needle. When we setup the hood we have to put the vials in, the closed system device topper for each vial, the chemo tubing, etc. we also have to recheck the calculations (Epic isn’t foolproof on calculating quantities, and chemo always should get two checks). Then we can make the chemo. Also for us, the hood is small, only one person can get in to make stuff, and managing 10 chemos at one time gets a little crazy, and overwhelming for the claustrophobic tech in a small room. We are trying our best to get the chemo up to you, But these drugs are very dangerous. We are going to take the extra time to make sure it’s done as safe as possible for you and the patient. \n\nTechs are able to answer some questions, and every call doesn’t need to go to a pharmacist.  The technicians are quite capable of handling a call for a missing dose, and will likely get it taken care of quicker than transferring the call straight to the pharmacist.  When I was a tech I’d try to see if there was any assistance I could offer (as the pharmacist is usually quite busy). Most of the time I could. Or if it was a quick question like IV comparability I could get the info together then ask the pharmacist to review and approve the answer.  Also they can answer the pyxis questions better than a pharmacist due to their everyday exposure to them. \n\nWe can’t change “routes” of medication unless there is a hospital protocol in place “like changing from IV to PO.”  Changing the “route” requires a new order.  Now changing to liquid from tablet, we may be able to do. We just have to make sure we are not switching ER formulations to liquid because that requires an order as well. \n\nArgatroban levels can’t be drawn out of the line. They must be gotten peripherally. I’ve had incorrect levels come back several times because the lab was drawn through the A-Line.  Even if you waste the blood from the line first, the results get skewed. Argatroban can be finicky, so please be patient if pharmacy is adjusting the dose. \n\nWhen doing a med rec ask the patient how they take each med. You’ll be surprised how many people take BID doses once a day, or they went to the physician and now they are taking half the dose they were before (which doesn’t change on the med rec until a new RX is written)  Ask about what herbal and OTC meds the patient is on.  Some herbals interact with meds, and some increase risk of bleeding. Ask if they are using any creams or nasal sprays as well. Those get forgotten.  If you need help entering a drug check with the pharmacist. We have access to a wider number of products.  Also documenting the time of day they last took a dose helps when they are admitted in the middle of the day and you don’t know if the patient needs their morning meds or not.   Also it saves time if you\nput what time of day the patient takes the drug.  This allows it to be scheduled appropriately making the patient much happier. When adding a med to a patient’s MAR, choose the actual drug with a strength. The ones without a strength don’t work right when the patient gets admitted. \n\nIf a patient has odd strengths to make a total daily dose, enter both meds with a note saying how they take the med (I e patient takes 200 mg in the morning  and 100 mg in the morning, put in both strengths. If the directions for something is not standard, you may have the opportunity to enter (see admin instructions) vs whatever pops up as a default. I’ve seen many scripts pop over into verification as once daily orders when they may be taking it something  way off the rails   This causes things to get missed in verification and which causes an upset patient. \n\nAlways double check the patient’s home coumadin regimen. Even if they stopped before surgery find out what the most recent schedule was. It’s helpful when they restart. \n\nIf a patient takes a medication once a week, ask them what day and leave a note for the RPh. If it’s monthly also ask what day of the month. \n\nIf a patient brings in a bottle of Wellbutrin while doing a med rec, take the extra second to write a note saying “visually confirmed Wellbutrin XL 300 mg”. It usually saves a phone call down the road. It’s honestly one of the more confusing home meds that gets messed up a lot. \n\nI’m sorry for such a long list.  I’ve sat here and written this over about an hour while falling asleep.  I love my nurses at work and on the floors I work we work as a team. My mom was a nurse and I will always go the extra bit to help a nurse out.  It’s a tough job. \n\nAlso I think communication among nursing, practioners, pharmacy, etc has gotten better over time.  Some of the residents alIve worked with I honestly miss them when they are gone.  \n\nThe pharmacy can’t always get it done right away, we have to triage the whole hospital. But your patient is on our mind too.\n\n### Comment ID do2pxck with +3 score by [(db_ggmm, Reddit, 2017-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/74v4nc/what_do_you_wish_nurses_knew/do2pxck/) (in reply to ID do2lzhs):\nDo you have a resource for \"no line draws for argatroban\" or any other such line draw forbidden drugs?\n\n#### Comment ID do2qxya with +2 score by [(iLLtreaturite1, Reddit, 2017-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/74v4nc/what_do_you_wish_nurses_knew/do2qxya/) (in reply to ID do2pxck):\nI’d have to look it up.

Our physicians sponsor education for us. The ED nurses are required to have experience and a higher level of education before applying. New ED nurses must have a BSN and attend a ‘residency’ lasting a year that includes floor time under supervision, research, and classroom time. It is possible that this improved knowledge also improves our relationships.  \n  \n\nI think that once some nurses reach a certain level of knowledge base, they seem to expect that everyone should have that same level and anyone who is still learning is not worthy of being in the field. Maybe they’ve forgotten what a learning curve is. Many nurses seem to think physicians should come out of the gate behaving as experienced attendings. I also find some residents assume all nurses have no understanding of care and some attendings treat nurses as though they are a bane to the world. We all have teaching moments. New, seasoned, nurse, physician, all of us learn daily.   \n  \n\nI have taken to acknowledgement of teaching moments and peer accountability to prevent future occurrences. When you explain to the new nurse why the patient getting a dose of Lasix needs a weight first, then you will get that weight for the rest of his career. When you show the new ICU resident how to enter a medicine order as STAT if he wants it given in the ED, then he’ll get the order right for the rest of his career. Should both of these people already have known how to do these things? Yes. Are they less worthy of respect because they didn’t? No. They just need education. \n   \n\nIf I heard you calling me a *dumb gap* I would feel like you think my opinion is for shit and would see you as part of the problem. We’re all *dumb* in something and the only way to improve is to teach.\n\n## Comment ID do1myk0 with +34 score by [(onethirtyseven_, Reddit, 2017-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/74v4nc/what_do_you_wish_nurses_knew/do1myk0/) (in reply to ID 74v4nc):\nI wish they understood just how different our training is, and just how much they don’t know (but often seem to think that they do know).

NCLEX is just a mind-fuck safety test-taking test in the end with minimal medical knowledge required. \n\nMy favorite fellows and attendings include me in teaching rounds if time and the situation allows, quiz me/try to get me to see the whole clinical picture along with the interns and residents. Or just go out of their way and educate for a minute when I'm in their office. I know this isn't really their job, but the fellows are there for 3 years, and the attendings forever - and I'm there for at least a few years - they're investing in their nursing staff by doing that, which will hopefully make all of our jobs easier and improve clinical communication down the line.

Is the patient ill enough that such a procedure or study might become a necessity in the immediate future?  Does the patient have a reduced GCS?  Et cetera.

If you're wondering if something merits a call to the MD, just call. I would much rather get 10 potentially trivial pages than miss 1 important piece of information, particularly on postop patients. I'll admit this is a change from my attitude as a busy junior resident, but with a little maturity and a lot more responsibility as the senior resident, I want to know what's going on. We see patient for 10 minutes a day. You're our eyes and ears the rest of the 24 hours. Call. And if the junior resident blows you off and you're worried, call up the chain of command. If something isn't right and you think we need to lay eyes/hands on the patient, say so. Yeah, some of the doctors you call are going to be jerks, but at least you'll know you've done right by the patient for your part.\n\n## Comment ID do22556 with +6 score by [(None, Reddit, 2017-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/74v4nc/what_do_you_wish_nurses_knew/do22556/) (in reply to ID 74v4nc):\nhow to not be douchebags to the newbies.\n\n### Comment ID do27ln7 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2017-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/74v4nc/what_do_you_wish_nurses_knew/do27ln7/) (in reply to ID do22556):\nNurse here, I will pass on the message.

This is especially true for dextrose containing fluids. Firstly, you and I routinely go 8-12 hours without food overnight while asleep, with no ill effects. Secondly, if you work out the caloric intake from a D5 drip running at 125 cc/hr over 24 hours, it works out to be about 600 calories or two cans of coke. What you're doing with a D5 drip in people who are NPO long term is giving them enough calories to prevent your body from going into starvation ketosis, and if you don't have a stop date for the NPO in mind the team should be considering TPN within a week or so. \n\nSo to sum up, any time you call me about starting fluids on someone who was made NPO for say, an ultrasound or scope tomorrow, they won't be helpful and the answer will be no. Surgeons tend to like fluid pre-op as there's some literature implying that it may help mitigate intra-op hypotension, and after the OR for things like NG or ostomy losses where iatrogenic dehydration is a real risk. \n\nOh, and as a bonus, in DKA patients it's the anion gap that's important, not the blood glucose, which is why once their sugars normalize we start giving dextrose. Also, their total body stores of potassium are super low and routinely require a crazy amount of replacement, even if their serum potassium looks high normal on the current draw. The insulin will continue to shift potassium back into their cells and that 5.0 could be 2.5 next draw. I find especially with junior nurses I have to fight to have my orders implemented as written because the medical situation doesn't fit your normal algorithm for interpreting lab results.\n\n### Comment ID doqyhvp with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2017-10-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/74v4nc/what_do_you_wish_nurses_knew/doqyhvp/) (in reply to ID do4ar54):\nThis was a great and detailed response!

Add aerobic base and antagonist/mobility work and you've got a well rounded climbing training routine. /r/climbharder has loads of good readings, and there are dozens of books on the subject of training to climb hard.\n\nThe main keys are sleep 9 hours everyday and make sure your nutrition is on point, just that and climbing a lot will make you send hard, the extra training is just to give you an edge and help you progress faster when you already have that going on. Depending on how soon your competition is, you might not have the time to make a significant impact by adding stuff to your fitness routine. I'd focus on showing up well rested (like have a mellow climbing session and a rest day before your contest). I love to eat fruit (usually an apple this time of year) after warming up when I really want to send, it sends carbs straight to my muscles.\n\nRemember to have fun, if it's your first competition it's probably more of a friendly scramble where you'll be trying super hard on boulders above your level, take it as an opportunity to try extra hard, get beta from stronger climbers, and figure out your weaknesses to go back to training with improved focus.\n\n## Comment ID efjtdae with +15 score by [(0bsidian, Reddit, 2019-02-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/am6xfd/how_do_you_prepare_for_a_climbing_competition/efjtdae/) (in reply to ID am6xfd):\nTurn your shoes over.

I find that the week before a competition is all about rest and recovery. Backing off hard finger training 5-8 days out, backing off anaerobic training 3-4 days out, not even aerobic training in the final 2-3 days. I eat light lean meals with a lot of protein and vegetables, drink a lot of water (\\~1 fluid ounce for every pound of body mass) throughout each day, and reduce sodium intake to almost none during the final 3 days.

Retaining a lot of water during training is a good thing, even if it makes you bloated and heavy. But shedding that unnecessary water weight in the 48-72 hours before a competition is a great way to temporarily reduce your body weight but 3-5%.\nYou cannot and should not simply stop drinking water however. But if you significantly reduce your sodium levels (for a short period of time) you will retain much less water. Does that make sense?\n\nPlease note that you should immediately introduce sodium back into your diet after the competition, as water retention is important for recovering from that intense athletic output.\n\n## Comment ID efm62ql with +2 score by [(mmeeplechase, Reddit, 2019-02-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/am6xfd/how_do_you_prepare_for_a_climbing_competition/efm62ql/) (in reply to ID am6xfd):\nYou’ve got some good practical advice so far (sleep, eat, relax), but there is one extra thing I really like to do before a big event.

While the learning curve is indeed steep and can be toxic in varying degrees, surgeons continue to have the best earning potential once you hit that 5-10 experiance years mark. With AI, information being more accessible and most people having a doctor in their family, there is only so much you can go relying on OPD income. Even if you make a name for yourself, there is only so much time you can run an OPD and your per hour rate cant exceed beyond a limit. Again there is only so much you can subordinate before patients feel they are not being treated by the doctor they came for. \n\nWhile a surgeon who specialises in a certain subfield/particular surgery and makes a name in that region as one of the best in the field will get people coming from around the place for him. Even if he charges extra, there is more than enough people willing to not put a price on health and will seek out the specific surgeon with 99% success rate over the usual 95%.

Organized by the NSX Club of America (NSXCA), this gathering was the perfect platform for Honda’s R&D team to gather valuable insights.\n\nThe team conducted several interviews with NSX owners, asking what they love most about the car and what features they hope to see in the next generation. They also talked to me, and I got a chance to provide feedback to help shape the future of this iconic supercar.\n\nWhenever I had the opportunity, I expressed dislike about the next NSX being fully electric, emphasizing that this wasn’t just my opinion but a sentiment widely shared among majority of NSX owners. Hopefully, they take this feedback into account, and we might be fortunate enough to see another hybrid in the future.\n\nJoined\n\n23 July 2003\n\nMessages\n\n579\n\nLocation\n\nNotCal\n\n1 December 2024\n\n#2\n\nWe've seen the movie \" Hybrid NSX \" - a sequel would have even more dismal sales than the NC1.

Honda/Acura has an opportunity to be out in front of the market with all electric NSX. Oh wait - why bother if it is going to take 12 years.\n\nRight on! I told them the same thing. The GEN2 didn’t perform as well because enthusiasts grew tired of waiting and waiting, eventually moving their attention to other brands. It’s critical to keep customers engaged and connected. A 12-year gap is far too long to maintain the interest and excitement of potential buyers. I suggested that they should have the GEN3 ready for a 2030 release... (thats 8 years)\n\nJoined\n\n30 January 2001\n\nMessages\n\n23,292\n\nLocation\n\nPa\n\n1 December 2024\n\n#4\n\ntough to call the future of sports cars at the sharp end...I agree you can't sit around talking about it..I also know that the attraction of Acura has always been to do it better in the segment at a reasonable price..We know they could build a car with nevera performance much cheaper...but would the engagement/drivability/fun quotient be there at hypercar levels..\n\nJoined\n\n23 July 2003\n\nMessages\n\n579\n\nLocation\n\nNotCal\n\n1 December 2024\n\n#5\n\nExcellent point and another reason hybrid doesn’t make sense. Electric is by far the best if you want computer controlled everything but what would make me get the checkbook out would be a light weight, stick shift NSX with a high rev NA ICE motor ( all things Honda does really well ) like Gordon Murray’s new T.50 at a Acura price point. It seems like they could easily do it in short timeframe and sell reasonable numbers of them at a profit. Unfortunately it will never happen - sigh.\n\nJoined\n\n23 July 2003\n\nMessages\n\n579\n\nLocation\n\nNotCal\n\n1 December 2024\n\n#6\n\nHonda R&D could just give docjohn and Dehaldaswerth one of the new cars to set the parameters and consult on the project.\n\nJoined\n\n30 January 2001\n\nMessages\n\n23,292\n\nLocation\n\nPa\n\n1 December 2024\n\n#7\n\nI would do it for only room and board...\n\nJoined\n\n15 January 2007\n\nMessages\n\n2,239\n\nLocation\n\nBraselton, GA\n\n3 January 2025\n\n#8\n\nNSXPO 2023 when the Acura Rep asked us who was excited about the all electric NSX, you could hear a pin drop.

I wish Honda would follow suite.\n\nACURA USA seems hell bent to push EVs, but they just don’t F'ing get it. Take the ZDX, for example—no one wants that POS, and they're slashing prices just to clear showroom floors. You can find a slighty used 24 for more than 50% off retail. So why on earth would they want to make the next NSX fully electric? The Gen 2, even as a hybrid, was proof enough that EV demand isn’t where they think it is. Ironically, just as people are finally warming up to Hybrids, many supercar manufacturers are shifting back from EV toward hybrids.\n\nLast edited: 29 January 2025",
