Just specify a server name (or IP address) and a port number. These tests will show up in the \"Network Performance\" and \"Network Topology\" screens in the \"Agents\" tab.\n\nWe added support for grouping multiple accounts into a single organization. Each account still has its own set of users and tests, but now you can make some users \"organization admins\" with special powers. Organization admins can create new accounts, delete existing accounts, and manage users within any account in the organization. Coming soon: organization admins will be able to log in to any account!\n\nA new update announcement at the top of the site (which you probably clicked on to get here).

From now on, our login system will use your primary email address (already in the system) to identify you. You'll no longer need to remember a separate username.\n\nWe have a new way to explore the Network Topology view. In addition to expanding hops in the middle of _all_paths, you can now expand all of the hops on a single path. Just click on the hop count on any path to show all of the hidden hops.\n\nPermalinks are now available for all views. Look for the small \"permalink\" widget at the top right corner of the page. Click it to reveal the direct url to the view, complete with its current state. You can send these links to other users to share the particular data point that you're looking at. We've already found it extremely useful for sharing events within the ThousandEyes team!\n\nAs promised in the last release, organization admins can now switch between accounts. Just click on your name on the top right of the page to bring up the account settings menu. At the bottom of the menu, you'll find the \"Switch Accounts\" link.",

Instant tests can now be found under Reports - Instant Test Report. We also renamed a few of the views for clarity.\n\nNew breadcrumbs - at the top of each page, you will now find navigation breadcrumbs to help you orient yourself and move between views.\n\nData shows up faster in views - we redesigned our backend so that users can receive data for their tests faster; now there can be partial aggregations in the last round of data available from the timeline for tests that are run from agents.\n\nGraphs replaced by Reports - due to the overlap in functionality we decided to merge the Graphs view into_Reports_. We plan to add some more report templates in the future to make it easier to slice and dice data, including a comparative report to compare one or more tests head to head.\n\nHighlight expanded nodes in Path Visualization graphs - after clicking on the number of hops on a path, the new nodes that become visible will flash for a short time. This makes it easier to identify which nodes were added."

You couldn't connect to our website? We show in this city of Arizona there was an outage and none of the Thousand Eye agents could reach us. It's a big deal for us since we're expected to be up 24/7. Same thing with seeing latency. For instance,  there was latency testing against our website from the Philippines,  but everywhere else it was less than 1 second.

We can influence inbound or route around outbound issues, by depreferring or completely shutting down peering with our upstream SPs. This has been useful and practical even with ASes 2-3 hops away from us, though usually if they are smaller networks that have only a few paths to/from us.\n2. Share ThousandEyes data with NOCs that insist there is no problem in their network or with our peering points.  Of course useful only with our direct peers. This can shorten time to resolution for my team, or give us ammo to request SLA credits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn both cases, it is mostly useful when the problem is persistent, longer lasting or recurring often. It doesn't benefit us if it's transient as we have to do all the identification and mitigation manually but that's more an \"us\" problem and not necessarily a factor of any monitoring tool like ThousandEyes.\n\n#### Comment ID i5lsrb9 with +1 score by [(Bubbasdahname, Reddit, 2022-04-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/u78idu/experiences_with_thousandeyes/i5lsrb9/) (in reply to ID i5g2nwb):\nIf we are down, we have to pay SLA fees.

It'll establish baselines for you though, then you can know when things are different.\n\nOne of the positives of ThousandEyes is that it can get data from other sensors that report into the TE system.  So when someone starts having issues -- let's say VPN begins to suck -- you can look and go \"aha!  There was a BGP path change between Seattle and Portland!\"  (Or whatever.)  You wouldn't necessarily be able to do that without other sensors within the system.\n\nNot saying it's the be-all and end-all of solutions, but that's one of the theoretical benefits of it.  I think there's an alternative out there -- I want to say built with open source software -- but I don't recall the name of it right now.  We gave TE a try, but as with most things, the licensing costs are high enough and we don't need the tool *that* badly.\n\n### Comment ID m6c6frs with +4 score by [(SuddenPitch8378, Reddit, 2025-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1hxpsz5/experience_with_thousandeyes/m6c6frs/) (in reply to ID m6b8pup):\nSmoke ping possibly\n\n#### Comment ID m6c8m1y with +3 score by [(farrenkm, Reddit, 2025-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1hxpsz5/experience_with_thousandeyes/m6c8m1y/) (in reply to ID m6c6frs):\nI'm distantly familiar with Smokeping.

It allowed us to know in advance what the applications were experiencing as we rolled out SDWAN and to determine if it was related to a project activity.\n\nEssentially, it is a synthetic monitoring tool but giving a lot of insight at the network level. In a way it allows a network admin know of application experience that is due to a network related issue before rhe application teams determine it to be so. It then allows the network team to take action and resolve the issue before the problem is reported.\n\n### Comment ID m6xkrd0 with +1 score by [(jiannone, Reddit, 2025-01-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1hxpsz5/experience_with_thousandeyes/m6xkrd0/) (in reply to ID m6bge2r):\nThis seems like a target usecase.

Where ThousandEyes shines is breaking Silo’s: having tangible evidence that the network is not at fault for application slowness, or is at fault, with a good indication of where the problem is. Helping in escalation, using a snapshot to make sure all parties are looking at the same data, so you can move to solving much quicker. \n\nThe most Happy customers integrate ThousandEyes in their workflow: if only an L3 network engineer looks at it chances are high that you won’t realize full potential: ideally you use it to prevent tickets going to those engineers. \n\nI would really advice you tot have a chat with your Cisco/ Thousandeyes  SE about what you want to achieve and how to best do that.

We didn't use the enterprise agents due to overly conservative cybersecurity restrictions.\n\nThe solution is good. It's very easy and quick to set up, and you can get a lot of information from it. Specifically, for a typical HTTPS server use case, you get the success rates and latencies of DNS lookup, the path trace, TCP latency, TLS negotiation and issues etc. You can also check the consistency of your DNSSEC delegations, do basic BGP watching, test against FTP servers and some other non-web stuff. It takes a screenshot and shows you when the presented web page changed, for example if you got hacked, or the server threw an error. You can also go whole hog and script an entire e-commerce transaction from start to checkout.\n\nYou get a reasonably decent alerting capability, and good management-friendly reports. The pre- and post-sales support was very good.\n\nA super nifty feature is the ability to share a specific test period/result. For example, if one of your SaaS vendors goes down for a maintenance window and claim they didn't, you can send them a link so they can look at your test results for their destination and a specific time. Or if there was a backbone hiccup, you can send the link to your ISP so they can look at it themselves.\n\nThere are other options like catchpoint etc. which are specialised in web app and page performance, telling you exactly how long what on a page takes, profiles backends and databases etc. but they don't tell you nearly as much about the path a user took to get to the server. So yes, it's partially overlapping functionality, but only partially, so depends on your use case.\n\nOverall we really liked it; the main problem was that it is really expensive. Once you start running tests from a dozen regions against a few dozen targets every five minutes, you're starting to look at mid to high five figures a year.\n\n## Comment ID m6bstiq with +4 score by [(antron2000, Reddit, 2025-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1hxpsz5/experience_with_thousandeyes/m6bstiq/) (in reply to ID 1hxpsz5):\nHad an engineer that kept complaining about slow network speeds.

So I have redundant IPS and firewalls (Meraki) in each office and I set up the IPS in an active-passive state for failover. However, during a recent network incident where my primary circuit experienced 10% packet loss for a short time, The wan circuit did not fail over (Expected behavior for meraki FW Possible to take up to five minutes). causing some users to be unable to access certain services for three minutes. I know that i cant control the internet so once it leaves my firewall its outa my hands but Having the ability to show that it's out on the Internet Via a dashboard is nice.\n\nI currently use 1000 Eyes with Enterprise agents and endpoint agents for monitoring, but these tests only run every five minutes and may not be the best solution for my organization's needs. (I could increase the resolution of the tests, but the tests incur licensing costs) Right now, with 1000 eyes, I'm tracking the availability of Google's DNS, then my three main SAS applications, and local network gateway. Additionally, while the Meraki dashboard provides information it is limited and only tracks The network device's ability to communicate to meraki, and not able to track access to services.\n\nI am considering alternative solutions such as PingDom to track WAN availability by pinging virtual IPs and reporting on SLA. Another option is to spin up a service in Azure, where I have virtual networks with tunnels to each site. By testing communication through these tunnels, I can monitor the ability to reach the Internet and end-point devices. but not Necessarily, the network's ability to communicate to my Saas endpoints.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any recommendations or ideas for the best solution to monitor my network's ability to communicate with the outside world.\n\n## Comment ID j7v6zwv with +3 score by [(SevaraB, Reddit, 2023-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/10xzi36/searching_for_the_best_solution_to_monitor/j7v6zwv/) (in reply to ID 10xzi36):\nYou're trying to solve a people problem with technology. Accepting up to 5m of downtime is part of the tradeoff you made as an org when you chose to use commodity circuits with SD-WAN.

It could be particular services or URLs, expected page content, typos and so on. Asking for the URL he is trying to access and check it (with browser, curl, or even telnet), and check the logs for errors regarding it, not just the service ones but all the levels up that delivers it.

If it doesn't resolve or render a HTTP response, you know right then and there. Going to data dog or Splunk or Grafana is the second choice as monitoring can be off.

It'll be good if it can somehow be linked to the reason of why a said server is down, e.g due to a breach or just a planned maintenance. \n\nP.S Bonus if there is an open source way to do this! \n\nThank you beforehand!\n\n## Comment ID hcpl9qg with +2 score by [(StrikingInfluence, Reddit, 2021-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/pngssr/where_can_i_get_freepaid_service_to_know_the/hcpl9qg/) (in reply to ID pngssr):\nI mean [https://downdetector.com/](https://downdetector.com/) is pretty legitimate but I'm not sure why you would need to have knowledge of Tier 1 ISP outages for your organization from a third party.  If you're an Enterprise level customer for a major ISP and there is an outage - you shouldn't be relying on a third part for that kind of information.\n\n### Comment ID hcpmdtk with +1 score by [(neobanana8, Reddit, 2021-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/pngssr/where_can_i_get_freepaid_service_to_know_the/hcpmdtk/) (in reply to ID hcpl9qg):\nHello, downdetector also have a paid service but I am not sure of the value (price vs quality) that I'm getting. e.g down detector only have graphs for the past 24 hours. Do you have experience with the paid version of downdetectors? \n\nFrom your response, do you think it is easier for me to gather the info myself instead of using third party? Do you have a recommended tools/ways to do the job?\n\n#### Comment ID hcpnhgv with +2 score by [(StrikingInfluence, Reddit, 2021-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/pngssr/where_can_i_get_freepaid_service_to_know_the/hcpnhgv/) (in reply to ID hcpmdtk):\nWell I'm kind of unsure why you would need this / want this?  From my experience the ISP is usually going to detect outages on their end long before you do and will alert all potentially impacted customers.  If you're an enterprise customer you may even have an account executive and support access that would be communicating with you.   \n\n\nAs for your environment whether it's on-prem or in the cloud - with properly tuned alerting and a SIEM you shouldn't need a custom script to scrape web data on outages.  For example, if you had Splunk you could use splunk event monitoring and create custom alerts from data that is fed into Splunk from your devices.\n\n## Comment ID hcpfoaz with +1 score by [(sidusnare, Reddit, 2021-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/pngssr/where_can_i_get_freepaid_service_to_know_the/hcpfoaz/) (in reply to ID pngssr):\nI keep on top of major things happening mostly by being subscribed to the NANOG and outages mailing lists.\n\nIf you want real-time public monitoring of the public internet, [https://downdetector.com/](https://downdetector.com/) [https://www.thousandeyes.com/outages/](https://www.thousandeyes.com/outages/) [https://status.aws.amazon.com/](https://status.aws.amazon.com/)  [http://www.internettrafficreport.com/](http://www.internettrafficreport.com/) [https://ihr.iijlab.net/ihr/en-us/](https://ihr.iijlab.net/ihr/en-us/) \n\nIf you want something that monitors relative to your infrastructure, [DynaTrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/platform/digital-experience-monitoring/), [DataDog](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/real-user-monitoring/), or  [NewRelic](https://newrelic.com/solutions/topic/digital-customer-experience) have solutions. I've used Keynote, which DynaTrace bought, and DataDog, though we used them on-prem.\n\n### Comment ID hcsew9m with +1 score by [(neobanana8, Reddit, 2021-09-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/pngssr/where_can_i_get_freepaid_service_to_know_the/hcsew9m/) (in reply to ID hcpfoaz):\nOther than NANOG, can I also know of the other mailing lists? Like I mentioned in the other comments, I am trying to make a personal outages monitor that is not limited to the cyberworld, though the cyberworld state is one of the things that I will monitor.\n\nFor thousandeyes, do you have experience with the paid service? Thanks for the other websites, I guess I have to scrape them manually using the available APIs\n\n#### Comment ID hct832f with +1 score by [(sidusnare, Reddit, 2021-09-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/pngssr/where_can_i_get_freepaid_service_to_know_the/hct832f/) (in reply to ID hcsew9m):\nhttps://wiki.outages.org/\n\n#### Comment ID hct872p with +1 score by [(sidusnare, Reddit, 2021-09-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/pngssr/where_can_i_get_freepaid_service_to_know_the/hct872p/) (in reply to ID hcsew9m):\nNot thousand eyes, no\n\n#### Comment ID hct8glh with +1 score by [(sidusnare, Reddit, 2021-09-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/pngssr/where_can_i_get_freepaid_service_to_know_the/hct8glh/) (in reply to ID hcsew9m):\nFor personal metrics, I just take the top 100 sites of the internet from [Alexa](https://www.alexa.com/topsites), and monitor them myself.

          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "Now, on to the negatives.\r\n\r\n * Culture of dishonesty: If a customer finds a major bug, it may be brushed off and fixed silently. If engineering finds a bug that affects customers and they don't know, it's silently fixed and no credits/notice is given, even for core functionality. Staff do not want to trust customers with the truth and feel that they can better earn their trust by hiding problems from them by lying. Staff may also not trust themselves for repercussions of their own bugs.\r\n\r\n * Fishy use of J1 VISAs for full-time, non-intern employees from abroad. You are quite likely reading this as someone outside of the US and may not know what a J1 is. If you don't, please read up on J1 VISAs. ThousandEyes will generally submit an application for an H1B VISA. Unfortunately, the process sucks and many people don't get accepted. What's sketchy is that they follow it up with a J1 VISA application if the H1B VISA doesn't go through. H1B is for workers, J1 is very explictly for interns at most. ThousandEyes had had one intern in all of my time there, the rest were clearly full time employees. The J1 VISA employees at ThousandEyes often have to fill out forms saying what they learned. These are things they probably learned ten years ago. While immigration is difficult in the US, I say this because you need to be aware that there is a chance (I am not a lawyer) than if you are sponsored on a J1 VISA for a non-intern position in ThousandEyes, you are doing something illegal (as would be ThousandEyes). Furthermore, there's a chance that ThousandEyes, if busted, might send you back home with a very difficult time immigrating in the future. Maybe in this political climate that will never happen, I don't know. But new recruits are not told this as far as I know, and you should know because it may be a huge risk. If you are from abroad, please read up on US immigration, J1 VISAs, and H1B VISAs. One last thing. If you do come in on an H1B VISA, salary information is public. You can go online and search for the salaries of many of the ThousandEyes staff. Maybe you don't want to do this, that's fine. But you should be told because it is public and thus no secret. You can do the same thing for Google, Facebook, etc, if you want to.\r\n\r\n * Not a very organic culture, discussions about the product often end up being told to go to off-topic areas. In particular, the VP of engineering will shoot down these conversations, but several in engineering are not very open minded. All in all, the culture at the dining table is pretty good, but when it comes to working it's not always the greatest mix.\r\n\r\n * The engineering staff is a huge mix of cultures. Most people speak English as a second language. This is very nice for diversity, but there are some obvious communication difficulties. All and all, cultural differences seem to be handled quite well. I've made some great friends there. Still, communication can be difficult.\r\n\r\n * Sales is in the same office and rarely stays around engineering for happy hours and such. There's a little bit of tension over their distance.Sales rarely stick around for lunch. Their turnover rate is very, very high (many gone in 3 months).\r\n\r\n * While this may or may not be exactly true, many of the engineers have more education than experience. While this is not a problem in and of itself, there are some narrow minds there that take a while to open up. I would advise that they emphasize more on experience in the future, rather than pulling in PHD students without professional experience.\r\n\r\n * After working around the product for eleven months, I was not impressed with it. It's helpful, but seems stop-gap. Feel free to open up a trial account and see for yourself how you feel about it.\r\n\r\n * The product is very enterprise focused. You have to buy it in one-year contract terms. This upsets me because I'd like to use the paid product, but there's almost no way I'm going to sign a year-long contract to do that. You may or may not like enterprise-centric businesses, so keep in mind that in mind.\r\n\r\n * All in all, it's the dishonesty that kills me. There are a lot of unhappy employees at ThousandEyes but they haven't left because of the difficulties in switching jobs over VISAs, or because they are in the greencard process. There are a lot of happy employees too, but I found that more of them had not had much prior work experience. It is my experience that there are many better companies in the area and in the US as a whole that you can work at. Places where the business is honest to its customers, where employees hear each other out, and where innovation is a bit more sensible. It's not a bad company, but it's not really good either. While there are many glowing reviews here, I recommend that you move along to a better place until there are significant changes at ThousandEyes. If some day they start openly sharing about their outages (and not other company's outages, which they use for publicity) and bugs, it may be a good sign things have changed. I do feel a bit attached and I like the company in many ways, but it has a long way to go, and unfortunately a lot of that work starts at the top.",

If this comes up without newlines, pipe this through sed replacing * with two newlines. ThousandEyes is a pretty small company and to some it may be obvious who I am. In the interest of an open and honest review, hopefully to your benefit, I will not try to be overly generic. I'd also like to focus a bit more on the positives. I am a former employee and I was there for eleven months. In my absense there have been some positive changes from what I hear.\r\n\r\n * The founders are tech savvy and sharp. Mohit gives good speeches. Ricardo is a bit of a networking wizard.\r\n\r\n * The food is great. There are off days here and there, but they make a great effort to have good catered food.\r\n\r\n * The office management staff is phenomenal. I miss a particularly warm smile every time I came into the office, possibly one of the best parts of my day.\r\n\r\n * Generous stock options.\r\n\r\n * I was once skeptical about pay, but it seems to be on par. You could probably make more at a non-startup, but either way you won't be making much with the insane cost of living in San Francisco. (50k in a normal city will offer a better quality of life than 100k in SF)\r\n\r\n * Business is doing great: The customer list is incredible, as is the growth.\r\n\r\n * Very fun offsites here and there. Overall, there's a decent community element between the employees.\r\n\r\n * Interesting technical challenges. A lot of the problems ThousandEyes faces are somewhat unique, both internally and intrinsically imposed. I had some pretty interesting things to do while I was there. There were some dumb grunt workish jobs at times, but overall I was given a good bit of flexibility. I would propose writing an in-house solution and work on it all on my own at times, rather than be forced to use something out of the box that didn't quite fit.\r\n\r\n * There's a high bar for code in some parts of the company. While it's annoying at times, I feel I really learned a lot by having such high standards put on what I was doing.",

The work environment is unprofessional and at sometimes, downright hostile.  The on-boarding training was sub par.  Sales numbers are declining across.   In 7 months I was asked to take on multiple roles on the team.  I was even asked to develop a sales territory via cold outbound prospecting which had no Account Executives hired to take meetings. The next career step was Corporate Sales and their manager was in the office maybe two days a week.  The SDR team is incredibly negative and sometimes personally insulting.

There are a few items we wish to highlight: 1) Many of our sales hires in Austin are new because the decision to start a customer centric hub in Austin was made just over a year ago. 2) Employees go through performance reviews and feedback. These HR conversations are confidential. 3) We are proud of the work being done by the SDR team and have invested in employee development with many examples of promotions from the SDR team to the Corporate Sales team and onwards as well as a recent change in sales model so CSR teams get the ability to partner with more experienced field sales teams. 4) The company is continuing to experience healthy growth driven by customer revenues.\r\n\r\nWe understand ThousandEyes may not be a fit for everybody. We appreciate your feedback and will continue working on creating a positive experience for everyone.\r\n\r\nDoug Cunningham\r\nManager, Enterprise Sales Development",

Lunch is provided daily and there are plenty facilities for team-building, including pool, ping-pong and video-games.\r\n\r\nThe platform itself is incredibly stable, and a consistent 2-week release-cycle means that bugs are fixed and features are added on a regular basis, which makes customers extremely happy.  Customer satisfaction and engagement rates are off the charts, and the live-chat support model is setting the standard for response &amp; resolution times.\r\n\r\nBest of all, this is a small company that is growing, so you are always going to be exposed to other areas of the business and have the opportunity to get involved in projects that span multiple departments.

This equates to fat bonuses!\r\n\r\n+ The engineering team is full of smart, experienced people; there is a strong \"no jerks\" rule when hiring.\r\n\r\n+ Most of our production services are deployed in Kubernetes\r\n\r\n+ The company culture is supportive, progressive, and light-hearted (Mohit is always telling dad-jokes in all-hands meetings, veteran engineers get their own bobble-head figurines, every engineer picks a superhero to be their avatar)\r\n\r\n+ The pay is top-notch: San Francisco-level salary + equity, but in Texas\r\n\r\n+ Strong commitment to mental health &amp; work-life balance",

        "advice": "Emphasize on honesty. Consider moving past just enterprise markets.",
        "cons": "Now, on to the negatives.\r\n\r\n * Culture of dishonesty: If a customer finds a major bug, it may be brushed off and fixed silently. If engineering finds a bug that affects customers and they don't know, it's silently fixed and no credits/notice is given, even for core functionality. Staff do not want to trust customers with the truth and feel that they can better earn their trust by hiding problems from them by lying. Staff may also not trust themselves for repercussions of their own bugs.\r\n\r\n * Fishy use of J1 VISAs for full-time, non-intern employees from abroad. You are quite likely reading this as someone outside of the US and may not know what a J1 is. If you don't, please read up on J1 VISAs. ThousandEyes will generally submit an application for an H1B VISA. Unfortunately, the process sucks and many people don't get accepted. What's sketchy is that they follow it up with a J1 VISA application if the H1B VISA doesn't go through. H1B is for workers, J1 is very explictly for interns at most. ThousandEyes had had one intern in all of my time there, the rest were clearly full time employees. The J1 VISA employees at ThousandEyes often have to fill out forms saying what they learned. These are things they probably learned ten years ago. While immigration is difficult in the US, I say this because you need to be aware that there is a chance (I am not a lawyer) than if you are sponsored on a J1 VISA for a non-intern position in ThousandEyes, you are doing something illegal (as would be ThousandEyes). Furthermore, there's a chance that ThousandEyes, if busted, might send you back home with a very difficult time immigrating in the future. Maybe in this political climate that will never happen, I don't know. But new recruits are not told this as far as I know, and you should know because it may be a huge risk. If you are from abroad, please read up on US immigration, J1 VISAs, and H1B VISAs. One last thing. If you do come in on an H1B VISA, salary information is public. You can go online and search for the salaries of many of the ThousandEyes staff. Maybe you don't want to do this, that's fine. But you should be told because it is public and thus no secret. You can do the same thing for Google, Facebook, etc, if you want to.\r\n\r\n * Not a very organic culture, discussions about the product often end up being told to go to off-topic areas. In particular, the VP of engineering will shoot down these conversations, but several in engineering are not very open minded. All in all, the culture at the dining table is pretty good, but when it comes to working it's not always the greatest mix.\r\n\r\n * The engineering staff is a huge mix of cultures. Most people speak English as a second language. This is very nice for diversity, but there are some obvious communication difficulties. All and all, cultural differences seem to be handled quite well. I've made some great friends there. Still, communication can be difficult.\r\n\r\n * Sales is in the same office and rarely stays around engineering for happy hours and such. There's a little bit of tension over their distance.Sales rarely stick around for lunch. Their turnover rate is very, very high (many gone in 3 months).\r\n\r\n * While this may or may not be exactly true, many of the engineers have more education than experience. While this is not a problem in and of itself, there are some narrow minds there that take a while to open up. I would advise that they emphasize more on experience in the future, rather than pulling in PHD students without professional experience.\r\n\r\n * After working around the product for eleven months, I was not impressed with it. It's helpful, but seems stop-gap. Feel free to open up a trial account and see for yourself how you feel about it.\r\n\r\n * The product is very enterprise focused. You have to buy it in one-year contract terms. This upsets me because I'd like to use the paid product, but there's almost no way I'm going to sign a year-long contract to do that. You may or may not like enterprise-centric businesses, so keep in mind that in mind.\r\n\r\n * All in all, it's the dishonesty that kills me. There are a lot of unhappy employees at ThousandEyes but they haven't left because of the difficulties in switching jobs over VISAs, or because they are in the greencard process. There are a lot of happy employees too, but I found that more of them had not had much prior work experience. It is my experience that there are many better companies in the area and in the US as a whole that you can work at. Places where the business is honest to its customers, where employees hear each other out, and where innovation is a bit more sensible. It's not a bad company, but it's not really good either. While there are many glowing reviews here, I recommend that you move along to a better place until there are significant changes at ThousandEyes. If some day they start openly sharing about their outages (and not other company's outages, which they use for publicity) and bugs, it may be a good sign things have changed. I do feel a bit attached and I like the company in many ways, but it has a long way to go, and unfortunately a lot of that work starts at the top.",

        "pros": "I've edited my review to try and make it more useful. Glassdoor may not support newline separation. If this comes up without newlines, pipe this through sed replacing * with two newlines. ThousandEyes is a pretty small company and to some it may be obvious who I am. In the interest of an open and honest review, hopefully to your benefit, I will not try to be overly generic. I'd also like to focus a bit more on the positives. I am a former employee and I was there for eleven months. In my absense there have been some positive changes from what I hear.\r\n\r\n * The founders are tech savvy and sharp. Mohit gives good speeches. Ricardo is a bit of a networking wizard.\r\n\r\n * The food is great. There are off days here and there, but they make a great effort to have good catered food.\r\n\r\n * The office management staff is phenomenal. I miss a particularly warm smile every time I came into the office, possibly one of the best parts of my day.\r\n\r\n * Generous stock options.\r\n\r\n * I was once skeptical about pay, but it seems to be on par. You could probably make more at a non-startup, but either way you won't be making much with the insane cost of living in San Francisco. (50k in a normal city will offer a better quality of life than 100k in SF)\r\n\r\n * Business is doing great: The customer list is incredible, as is the growth.\r\n\r\n * Very fun offsites here and there. Overall, there's a decent community element between the employees.\r\n\r\n * Interesting technical challenges. A lot of the problems ThousandEyes faces are somewhat unique, both internally and intrinsically imposed. I had some pretty interesting things to do while I was there. There were some dumb grunt workish jobs at times, but overall I was given a good bit of flexibility. I would propose writing an in-house solution and work on it all on my own at times, rather than be forced to use something out of the box that didn't quite fit.\r\n\r\n * There's a high bar for code in some parts of the company. While it's annoying at times, I feel I really learned a lot by having such high standards put on what I was doing.",

      "# [Test Type Layers and Units on 2024-08-15](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/user-management/usage-and-billing/test-layers-units)\nUnits for Cloud and Enterprise Agent tests are calculated based on various factors including their test type. Units for Device Agent tests are not calculated based on the same factors. This article explains how the test type variable applies to Cloud and Enterprise Agents unit calculation. For information about Device Agent unit calculation, see .\n\nWhile the overal equation for calculating units is the same across all Cloud and Enterprise Agent tests (see ), different test types themselves have different unit rates, and their type and configuration is what alters the results of the equation, as described in . Regardless of who the customer is, the unit rate for the test type itself doesn’t change.\n\nUsage accrues per configured test, and per agent. Rate is based on agent type (either Cloud or Enterprise Agent), test type, test interval, and test timeout setting. For example, running a test on a single Cloud Agent is cheaper than running the same test on 10 Cloud Agents; running a test on an Enterprise Agent costs less than running it on a Cloud Agent; and running a test on a 5-minute interval is cheaper than running the same test every 2 minutes.\n\nFor an example calculation, see .\n\nTest Type Layering\n\nThousandEyes test types include a “nesting” feature, as shown below. This diagram shows tests that are available from ThousandEyes Cloud and Enterprise Agents.\n\nThousandEyes test functionality is similar to that of the OSI stack, in that higher layers include lower ones. For example, the Network agent-to-server test also includes the BGP monitoring associated with the test target’s prefix. An HTTP server test includes both the Network agent-to-server test and BGP monitoring.\n\nDue to their nature, the DNSSEC and DNS trace tests do not implicitly contain lower level tests.\n\nNested Unit Consumption\n\nHigher layer tests consume the same number of units regardless of how many tests nest beneath them. That is, an HTTP server test, which includes agent-to-server and BGP tests, will only accrue the cost of the HTTP server test to your account (see the for an example of how an HTTP server test is calculated in units). Conversely, disabling nested tests under a higher level test does not save on units. So, for the same HTTP server test, if you turned off the agent-to-server nested test, it would still accrue the same number of units to your account. In essence, nested tests are free, so they neither cost more, nor save more.\n\nHow Do I Know How Many Units I Need?\n\nDesigning an optimal ThousandEyes test suite is a custom process. There is no one-size-fits-all solution – a lot depends on your critical business initiatives, and how your company is organized. As a new customer, your ThousandEyes account team will guide you in defining your use cases and in establishing proof of value (POV).\n\nHere are the rough steps that you can expect during the scoping process:\n\nOutcomes. First, determine your desired business outcome. For example “I want my e-commerce site to be available in all regions, with priority given to Central and South America because that’s where 80% of my customers are today.”\n\nTargets. Identify what assets you rely on for the desired business outcome. Assets are ThousandEyes test targets. For example, your e-commerce site would be one asset, and it might also rely on third-party cloud services, payment portals, or SaaS platforms.\n\nTest types. Determine which ThousandEyes test types are relevant to monitoring each target.\n\nVantage points. Consider the type of vantage points needed, for example whether you need Cloud Agents, Enterprise Agents, or both. Remember, usage-based consumption is only part of the picture; you might want to also make use of ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent licences and/or Internet Insights packages as well.\n\nIntervals. Identify an appropriate test frequency for each test. The test interval depends partly on your sensitivity to failure, i.e., how quickly you want to be alerted if something happens. For example, a social media streaming platform might want to know within two minutes if there’s a problem (before the news media starts reporting it) whereas for your company email portal, a five-minute interval might be enough. For very high-criticality test targets, you can use a one-minute testing interval with packet spreading as described on .\n\nTimeouts. For some tests, the timeout setting determines whether the test is deemed “successful” or not. You can also set alerts based on timeouts. Some agent locations or test targets may need a more generous timeout setting than others. When doing transaction scripts a longer timeout may be needed to complete the user journey.\n\nOptimizing Your Test Intervals\n\nIdeally, test intervals should be one, two, or five minutes except in special cases.\n\nDon’t increase the time between tests just to save money. There are other ways to maximize value that won’t reduce your ability to quickly detect outages that matter to you.\n\nBalancing test coverage against value optimization involves a series of trade-offs. If you reduce the test frequency, you’ll lose visibility and the ability to be proactive. For example, if you get an alert about an outage, but it only triggers an hour after the outage has started, a lot of users might be filing tickets and complaining – so, what have you saved?\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nThousandEyes has developed a number of prescriptive recommendations and templates to facilitate common use cases such as and Microsoft Office 365. Your ThousandEyes account team will guide you through these steps and help you achieve the maximum value from your tests and licensing agreements.\n\nCustomers seeking to exercise units from DNA subscription entitlements must request assistance in order to work with an account team.",
      "# [Cisco-owned ThousandEyes launches AI to predict and fix internet outages, teases ChatGPT-style tech by Ryan Browne, www.facebook.com on 2024-06-04](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/04/thousandeyes-launches-ai-to-fix-internet-outages-teases-genai-tool.html)\nSurasak Suwanmake | Moment | Getty Images\n\nCisco's ThousandEyes internet monitoring unit on Tuesday unveiled new artificial intelligence-powered capabilities it said will allow for much faster prediction and diagnosis of internet outages and disruptions.\n\nThe company said its new AI tech, called Digital Experience Assurance, or DXA, would enable customers of Cisco's networking technology to introduce the ability to automatically act on issues in their network quality.\n\nThis is opposed to what is currently the case with ThousandEyes' software, where customers mostly only monitor their IT infrastructure for network issues.\n\n'Google Maps of the internet'\n\nCisco ThousandEyes terms itself the \"Google Maps\" of the internet. That's because it has a broad, end-to-end view of every user and any application over any network.\n\nFounded 15 years ago, the company says it's been investing lots into AI in the past several years.\n\nBut now, ThousandEyes is making big, AI-focused changes to its platform aimed at giving its client base even more visibility over network quality and resilience.\n\nJoe Vaccaro, vice president and general manager of ThousandEyes, said DXA would provide the ability \"not only to resolve issues before they begin to impact my users, but leverage broad data to actually begin to predict and give forward intelligence on what might happen across infrastructure, to proactively address it before it begins to significantly degrade overall digital experiences.\"\n\n\"Digital experience assurance helps to build upon this evolutionary journey beyond metrics, beyond monitoring, towards a platform that delivers on a closed loop system,\" Vaccaro told CNBC in an exclusive interview.\n\nAmong the other capabilities, DXA comes with are the ability for businesses to correlate, analyze, diagnose, predict, optimize, and remediate with little or no manual intervention.\n\nCisco ThousandEyes says its platform is powered by over 650 billion daily measurements collected from around the globe. The firm committed to giving businesses visibility into their internal environments, including on-premises networks and cloud environments.\n\nThe product builds on Cisco ThousandEyes' Event Detection tech, which the company says already reduces the time taken to detect a disruption event to mere minutes and less staffing, rather than hours and multiple engineers.\n\nAI-generated internet status reports\n\nVaccaro also teased the development of a new product at Cisco ThousandEyes that, once complete, would enable users to generate AI-create scripts showing the status of global ISP (internet service provider), public cloud, and edge service networks, or an application's connection a network.\n\nThis is similar to what ThousandEyes currently offers for internet monitoring, but with AI automatically doing the work rather than people.\n\n\"That is in development and should be seeing the light of day here in the very, very near future,\" Vaccaro told CNBC.\n\nThe product would incorporate large language models, which are considered the bedrock of generative AI systems like ChatGPT and Google Gemini.\n\nRacking up 100 million users to date, ChatGPT was catapulted into global virality just months after its creator OpenAI released it. The app's success stoked massive hype around artificial intelligence, with companies of all stripes making developments of their own in the space.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct the day of the announcement.",
      "# [ThousandEyes Enterprise Agent Proxy Certificate by community.cisco.com, user-id on 2024-08-26](https://community.cisco.com/t5/thousandeyes/thousandeyes-enterprise-agent-proxy-certificate/td-p/5165830)\nHi\n\nI've recently installed ThousandEyes Enterprise Agents on some Cat9300-48UXM running IOS-XE 17.9.5 and 17.12.4. Since company proxy is using internal CA certificates, I had to install those certificates in docker container as described here: https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/global-vantage-points/enterprise-agents/troubleshooting/installing-ca-certificates-on-enterprise-agents#installing-on-cisco-docker-devices\n\nThis was working fine until ThousandEyes updated itself which led to the removal of the installed certificates and loss of connectivity through proxy to ThousandEyes portal. After I reinstalled the certificates, connectivity was restored.\n\nIs there a way to:\n\n- Disable auto-update to prevent certificate removal?\n\n- Disable removal of manually installed certificates?\n\n- Automatically install certificates during auto-update?\n\nOr is there an other solution for this suboptimal behaviour?\n\nThank you!\n\nHi @dominikhug - welcome to the support community! I'm working on getting some input from our experts, but would like to ask you for a bit more detail on one thing first: when you say ThousandEyes updated itself, can you be a bit more specific?\n\nThe normal updates of the ThousandEyes service within the container should not remove the installed CA certificates, so it's really unusual to hear that it wiped them.\n\nDo you have any more specifics about what updated, when, and if there were any other details included?\n\nHi @Tyler Langston\n\nI currently have ThousandEyes Enterprise Agent installed on 4 Cat9300. All of them were suddenly offline in ThousandEyes dashboard putting following message in switchlog:\n\n108016: Aug 26 07:50:37.499: %IM-5-IOX_INST_NOTICE: Switch 1 R0/0: ioxman: IOX SERVICE ThousandEyes_Enterprise_Agent LOG: Error calling getController: Curl error: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate 108017: Aug 26 07:50:41.698: %IM-5-IOX_INST_NOTICE: Switch 1 R0/0: ioxman: IOX SERVICE ThousandEyes_Enterprise_Agent LOG: Error calling checkIn: Curl error: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate 108018: Aug 26 07:51:11.338: %IM-5-IOX_INST_NOTICE: Switch 1 R0/0: ioxman: IOX SERVICE ThousandEyes_Enterprise_Agent LOG: Error calling getController: Curl error: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate 108019: Aug 26 07:51:14.790: %IM-5-IOX_INST_NOTICE: Switch 1 R0/0: ioxman: IOX SERVICE ThousandEyes_Enterprise_Agent LOG: Error calling checkIn: Curl error: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate 108020: Aug 26 07:51:45.129: %IM-5-IOX_INST_NOTICE: Switch 1 R0/0: ioxman: IOX SERVICE ThousandEyes_Enterprise_Agent LOG: Error calling getController: Curl error: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate 108021: Aug 26 07:51:48.636: %IM-5-IOX_INST_NOTICE: Switch 1 R0/0: ioxman: IOX SERVICE ThousandEyes_Enterprise_Agent LOG: Error calling checkIn: Curl error: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate\n\nAfter I've reinstalled SSL certificate again on one of those switches, it was able to reconnect to dashboard. I can now see this reconnected switch has a different agent version (1.195.0) than those which are unable to reconnect (1.191.0). So I now suspect, agent has been updated automatically and somehow deleted the manually installed certificates. The certificates even disappeared from /usr/share/ca-certificates/-directory. Because of this change in agent version, I currently suspect this update was causing my issues.\n\nHi @dominikhug - thank you for this information, it's exactly what I needed! I got these details to my experts and they had some thoughts for you:\n\nThe normal update of the ThousandEyes service within the container should not remove the installed CA certificates. If the agent container image was automatically updated by some external process (process outside of the agent container), like as part of Catalyst Center or vManage, then this could have removed the CA certificate and it would need to be re-added after the container was reinstalled. Currently CA certificates have to be installed on the agent container after installation, we cannot pass them to the container during install. We note this in our docs here.\n\nAn \"update\" of the container image by an external source is considered a reinstall because an updated image of the container is downloaded, the old container is destroyed, and a new container is created with the new image.\n\nSince they still see the old agent in the platform, that leads us to believe that the agent has been reinstalled, thus creating a new agent. Reinstalling the agent should deploy a new updated agent, thus \"removing\" any custom changes like a CA cert (it is not \"removing\" anything, it is installing a new agent without the custom modifications).\n\nThis does not mean that the agent updating itself is what removed the CA certs. We'd need to investigate with them why the original containers stopped working, which prompted the reinstall of the new containers/re-adding the CA certificate to get the container online.\n\nPlease request the member contact our Support team so we can help them uncover more of what happened.\n\nIf you need help contacting support, we have a quick walkthrough of that process here!",

By correlating cloud infrastructure and services with user experience, application health, and end-to-end network paths, ThousandEyes delivers deep insight for network, SRE, and cloud operations teams, so they can rapidly identify and resolve their most challenging issues.\n\nThousandEyes Traffic Insights extends ThousandEyes visibility deeper into on-premises networks by collecting and correlating traffic flows with its synthetics measurements, enabling customers to rapidly detect performance issues and pinpoint them to real traffic bottlenecks and anomalies within their networks. By providing a unified view of external and internal network conditions, customers can streamline their operational workflows and reduce their mean time to identify (MTTI) and remediate issues—regardless of whether they own the network or not. ThousandEyes will support flow collection for both Cisco and non-Cisco networking platforms.\n\nThousandEyes Endpoint Experience is now enriched with Meraki Wi-Fi and Local Area Network (LAN) telemetry and device information, enabling customers to gain deeper insight into local network issues impacting user experience.\n\nMeraki Assurance Overview is now powered by ThousandEyes Internet and SaaS visibility, empowering customers with insight into performance beyond their Meraki Wi-Fi and LAN environment to rapidly pinpoint issues across owned and unowned domains.\n\nSupporting Comments\n\n“Worker productivity and customer satisfaction are top-ranked strategic business priorities for organizations of all sizes, industries, and regions. It is imperative for IT organizations to deliver consistently positive digital experiences to both employees and customers. The challenge is these digital experiences are determined by an increasingly complex technology infrastructure where networks, data centers, cloud services, security mechanisms, endpoints, and an ever-growing set of data and applications must all work in concert. Factor in the accelerating use of external systems and services within the infrastructure and further complications arise in measuring, managing, and, ultimately, delivering an overarching positive digital experience to all. The industry needs simpler,\" said Mark Leary, Director, Network Observability and Automation, IDC. \"The industry needs smarter. Comprehensive data collection and cross-domain data correlation, driven by applied intelligence and embedded automation, stands to have a dramatic impact on IT engineering and operations as well as business execution and outcomes.”\n\n\"Experiencing our modern, timeless, and artisan-crafted home furnishings is incredibly important. So when we moved from in-person showrooms to virtual environments, one of our biggest challenges was to make sure customers could have the same great in-person experience, but remotely,” said Mark Rodrigue, Senior Network Engineer, Room & Board. “Being able to see and manage the Internet environments we now leverage to connect with our customers has been a game changer for our ability to assure performance. Before using ThousandEyes, it could take us days to understand where an issue was occurring, but now, we’ve seen a 96% improvement in our response time—and that’s been a game-changer for both fixing issues and working with the cloud and Internet service providers that we rely on.”\n\nAdded Resources\n\nBlog: Entering the New Era of Digital Experience Assurance Across Every Network\n\nBlog: It’s Time to Take Control of Experiences and Transform Infrastructure Operations for AI\n\nPress Release: Cisco Reveals Nexus HyperFabric AI Clusters, A New Simplified Data Center Infrastructure Solution with NVIDIA for Generative AI\n\nAbout Cisco\n\nCisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide technology leader that securely connects everything to make anything possible.
