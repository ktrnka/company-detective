We can influence inbound or route around outbound issues, by depreferring or completely shutting down peering with our upstream SPs. This has been useful and practical even with ASes 2-3 hops away from us, though usually if they are smaller networks that have only a few paths to/from us.\n2. Share ThousandEyes data with NOCs that insist there is no problem in their network or with our peering points.  Of course useful only with our direct peers. This can shorten time to resolution for my team, or give us ammo to request SLA credits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn both cases, it is mostly useful when the problem is persistent, longer lasting or recurring often. It doesn't benefit us if it's transient as we have to do all the identification and mitigation manually but that's more an \"us\" problem and not necessarily a factor of any monitoring tool like ThousandEyes.\n\n#### Comment ID i5lsrb9 with +1 score by [(Bubbasdahname, Reddit, 2022-04-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/u78idu/experiences_with_thousandeyes/i5lsrb9/) (in reply to ID i5g2nwb):\nIf we are down, we have to pay SLA fees.

Another tool for the tool belt. Whether it's a user's home connection or not, if its a work provided PC/laptop in which they reporting as having issues on, they're going to reach out to their workplace's support first almost 99% of the time. \n\n2. Split-tunnel + \"internet website is slow\" =/= not my problem. Cloud services need to be taken into consideration and to do so sanely, you need some insight from the perspective of the user's connection. This is also huge in cases where suddenly multiple or a subset of users are reporting similar issues and tools such as TE, you may be able to quickly identify this is an issue with a provider/region or even know about it before the report come in. Instantly slashing to time needed to investigate 10s or 100s of support cases.\n\n3. May be controversial but non-voluntary and required WFH change, at least for post-employment perspective, does impose at minimum a very high level support requirement of the business (some case required legal reimbursement). 99% of users know zero networking, purchase the cheapest plans and use the provided combo routers which serves their purposes. So when they move to WFH and suddenly have difficulty maintaining their level of work due to connectivity issues, the business should at least provide incredible basic tshooting or at least guidance whether on what to relay to their provider or a potential requirement to upgrade their service/equipment. I have witnessed remote users spend hundreds on routers (due to marketing non-sense) and stuck in contracts due to service plan upgrades because they were grasping at straws for a stable work experience and in the end being let go when it could have been solved with basic tshooting.\n\nBasically, if you're going to have to deal with the support request regardless, a tool that speeds up tshooting and reduces back and forth conversations has a value of its own. Time spent even reading a support case is time spent not working on other support cases. That time is a cost in and of itself.\n\n#### Comment ID i8uwm46 with +1 score by [(ChuckIT82, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uqvmps/anyone_using_thousandeyes_endpoint_agents/i8uwm46/) (in reply to ID i8uktkx):\nexact same 3 points why we're using it.\n\n### Comment ID i8u6xc0 with +5 score by [(certpals, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uqvmps/anyone_using_thousandeyes_endpoint_agents/i8u6xc0/) (in reply to ID i8u4kw2):\nThat's exactly what I thought.

But I work in a small enough org (approx 250 users), where if executive Bob has issues at home, it is still IT's problem. And even if it's receptionist Jane and she puts a ticket in while working from home, we still investigate instead of saying \"sorry, since you are at home we can't troubleshoot\".\n\nBut to be honest, my post doesn't necessarily come from only that type of scenario. Last week, we had users at a branch complain of performance issues with Salesforce. Well, at HQ we didn't have any issues with Salesforce, and the network didn't have any obvious red flags (I have a network monitor at our datacenter, and the traffic to that branch seemed fine, the throughput seemed fine, ping, tracert, etc all seemed fine). So there I am trying to figure out why this site was having performance issues to Salesforce, with no visibility as to why the issue was only impacting them. And at the time, I remember thinking to myself: \"doesn't something like ThousandEyes have the ability to say \"here is where the issue is between your user and Salesforce\"?\"\n\nTurns out the issue was a portion of the Salesforce page was trying to load from Germany, and Germany was blocked at that branch.\n\n#### Comment ID i8unrc1 with +1 score by [(Syde80, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uqvmps/anyone_using_thousandeyes_endpoint_agents/i8unrc1/) (in reply to ID i8udlma):\n> where if executive Bob has issues at home, it is still IT's problem.\n\nThis is something I really love from having moved from a smaller org to municipal government.

Upload speed is normal and its a 500/500 fiber connection.

If you see normal throughput on traffic that appears to originate from another site, you can basically narrow it down to somewhere between your firewall and your ISP's path to Microsoft, if they don't peer with them directly. This gets tricky when the path crosses another provider's network that doesn't have a peering relation with your ISP, assuming your ISP is willing to escalate the issue. \n\nIf you've got an account rep with them I would get them on the phone and see if you can get them to run your tests from further within their network.

Then when you get the report you need to check it over and go from there.  Generally if this test comes back clean and you're still convinced that the issue is with the ISP you can have them send a tech out to the actual handoff at your site and test end-to-end from your handoff.  If they find the connection is clean you will be billed for the truck roll.\n\n Keep escalating the ticket with the ISP throughout the day to make sure the test actually gets done.  Escalate your ISP ticket to the highest level as soon as possible, that's how you actually get them to look at the issue.  A lot of ISPs won't let you speak with a manager or a tech who actually knows what they're doing until you've escalated the ticket multiple times.\n\nKeep in mind that since this is DIA, anything after the ISP handoff to the internet, that traffic is not guaranteed by your SLA.  They only guarantee the traffic up to their internet handoff, because they have no control over what happens to your traffic over the greater internet.\n\n### Comment ID kv11yxy with +1 score by [(Outrageous_Plant_526, Reddit, 2024-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1beukvm/how_to_push_isp_to_actually_investigate_download/kv11yxy/) (in reply to ID kuw9x8f):\nYet only Microsoft traffic is slow as crap.

Maybe their main IP transit link is bigger, and has plenty of capacity available, and the Direct Peering link is smaller (or, just simply saturated) yet is chosen as a ‘better route’ due to less hops. However, typically a IX/peering link connects to a shared L2 switched network so multiple networks can directly peer together on the same network. A trace route may or may not show this hop (egress) and a Microsoft route server/looking glass would confirm the opposite direction (ingress) path. HOWEVER I would also expect other peers like google, Amazon, akaimei etc to also have the issue (big hitters). \n\n-or your isp uses a shitty IP transit provider (NSP) OR uses another upstream ISP and they are shitty at capacity planning / routing. Likely a transit provider (for example, cogent) who has no clue about the issue. \n\nDo this. Plug in direct. Recreate the issue. Take a wireshark of it. Email it to your isp. Then tell them you would like to discuss your SLA (or contract… or simply the price you pay). I’m willing to bet they’ll look at the root cause over rifling through your wireshark or wanting to discuss contractual obligations.\n\n## Comment ID kuzif1v with +1 score by [(cubical_monkey, Reddit, 2024-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1beukvm/how_to_push_isp_to_actually_investigate_download/kuzif1v/) (in reply to ID 1beukvm):\nI work at an ISP and recently troubleshot a similar issue with Microsoft sites.

      "# Post ID 11ydm1l: what do you use for network monitoring? with +15 score by [(gahd95, Reddit, 2023-03-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/meraki/comments/11ydm1l/what_do_you_use_for_network_monitoring/)\nHi,\n\nSo as the title says, i was wondering what everyone else use to monitor their network. Currently we use PRTG which works great for downtime, netflow and such. But i am looking for something with a bit more depth. Currently we are not able to scan switches and access points, due to those devices being on a non vpn management vlan, but maybe some tool would be able to father data from those devices using the meraki dashboard api?\n\n\n\nAlso i would really like to be able to test the connection between point A and point B. Something like the features of Cisco ThousandEyes. Without it being so gosh darn expensive.\n\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n## Comment ID jd776mk with +4 score by [(chiapeterson, Reddit, 2023-03-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/meraki/comments/11ydm1l/what_do_you_use_for_network_monitoring/jd776mk/) (in reply to ID 11ydm1l):\nDomotz\n\n### Comment ID jd7our1 with +2 score by [(VioletiOT, Reddit, 2023-03-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/meraki/comments/11ydm1l/what_do_you_use_for_network_monitoring/jd7our1/) (in reply to ID jd776mk):\nawesome!! :)\n\n## Comment ID jd7el87 with +7 score by [(MartinJSa, Reddit, 2023-03-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/meraki/comments/11ydm1l/what_do_you_use_for_network_monitoring/jd7el87/) (in reply to ID 11ydm1l):\nSorry this is a bit of a plug - but I'm product director for a company called Highlight that creates a network service assurance (inc monitoring) platform that's quite tightly integrated with Meraki's dashboard APIs - we're on the Meraki app marketplace [here](https://apps.meraki.io/en-US/apps/381711/highlight-service-assurance-platform/overview). There is a quite a lot of Meraki data that's only available via the APIs so we've given up mostly with SNMP polling of Meraki devices. \n\nMeraki does a continuity test from its MX appliances by default to [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8), but that's configurable and you can add other test endpoints. Annoyingly we don't have that test data in Highlight yet (we do the VPN test data) but I'm planning on bringing it in soon.\n\n### Comment ID jd9296c with +3 score by [(burnte, Reddit, 2023-03-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/meraki/comments/11ydm1l/what_do_you_use_for_network_monitoring/jd9296c/) (in reply to ID jd7el87):\nPersonally I thank you for noting in your post that you work for them.

The db service is ofter required to be reachable at a single IP address.\nIf the VM (or local DC) goes down, the applications should just reach the backup VM that comes up with the same IP address.\nMost \"solution\" to this is to have a single VLAN spanning across multiple DCs. The applications just hit the same IP address, and routers use L2 addresses to find the alive db VM (wherever that might be).\nAnother use case is to spin up a secondary stateful VM in a backup location and use the same IP as the original VM.\nIf anyone is aware of an elegant and standards-based solution to live VM migration across DCs, please do let me know.\n\n### Comment ID lgrcqwj with +3 score by [(telestoat2, Reddit, 2024-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1eldsbq/what_are_the_major_unresolved_problems_in/lgrcqwj/) (in reply to ID lgr6gvr):\nMobile IP has been a thing since the 1990s, just not super popular due to needing support in basically all Internet routers [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile\\_IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_IP) ... same thing for security, most Internet routers aren't about to support the Evil Bit either from back in 2003 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil\\_bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_bit) if such a thing could even exist and be useful.\n\nIPv6 is already mostly here, standardized APIs are already here with SNMP and netconf, openconf, and restconf.

Lunch is provided daily and there are plenty facilities for team-building, including pool, ping-pong and video-games.\r\n\r\nThe platform itself is incredibly stable, and a consistent 2-week release-cycle means that bugs are fixed and features are added on a regular basis, which makes customers extremely happy.  Customer satisfaction and engagement rates are off the charts, and the live-chat support model is setting the standard for response &amp; resolution times.\r\n\r\nBest of all, this is a small company that is growing, so you are always going to be exposed to other areas of the business and have the opportunity to get involved in projects that span multiple departments.

It means a lot of OKRs, tight deadlines, shortage of people, a lot of responsibility. At least, that's how I felt;\r\n\r\n- I've met people who knew absolutely nothing about Frontend being gently \"asked\" to build UIs for months because that was the goal for the team and personal goals don't usually align with team's goals;\r\n\r\n- Full-stack teams imply that you, as a contributor, must be able both to grasp the essence of an efficient query for one database, be able to build UIs, and always be part of the on-call rotation. You also have to keep in mind that one team's area of responsibility is often very large, and there are often not that many developers. 😉\r\n\r\n- Past developers, and now \"effective\" team managers who have been with the company for a very long time, in my feeling have absolutely no idea how to help develop and help grow, but only make sure OKRs are met. Just ask a manager how he helped his IC grow in past few years and how many engineers got promotions because of his guidance. Also, ask how many developers have left his team in the past year;\r\n\r\n- In my opinion, many internal systems are still immature, which leads to a lot of constant changes &amp; annoying routine work;\r\n\r\n- Once you set everything up for work, no boring week-long training on a very complex product - you are just given a task and from that moment on you are on your own.",

The work environment is unprofessional and at sometimes, downright hostile.  The on-boarding training was sub par.  Sales numbers are declining across.   In 7 months I was asked to take on multiple roles on the team.  I was even asked to develop a sales territory via cold outbound prospecting which had no Account Executives hired to take meetings. The next career step was Corporate Sales and their manager was in the office maybe two days a week.  The SDR team is incredibly negative and sometimes personally insulting.  The new SDR manager is trying to change this, but I fear the momentum is too much.",

There are a few items we wish to highlight: 1) Many of our sales hires in Austin are new because the decision to start a customer centric hub in Austin was made just over a year ago. 2) Employees go through performance reviews and feedback. These HR conversations are confidential. 3) We are proud of the work being done by the SDR team and have invested in employee development with many examples of promotions from the SDR team to the Corporate Sales team and onwards as well as a recent change in sales model so CSR teams get the ability to partner with more experienced field sales teams. 4) The company is continuing to experience healthy growth driven by customer revenues.\r\n\r\nWe understand ThousandEyes may not be a fit for everybody. We appreciate your feedback and will continue working on creating a positive experience for everyone.\r\n\r\nDoug Cunningham\r\nManager, Enterprise Sales Development",

You also have to keep in mind that one team's area of responsibility is often very large, and there are often not that many developers. 😉\r\n\r\n- Past developers, and now \"effective\" team managers who have been with the company for a very long time, in my feeling have absolutely no idea how to help develop and help grow, but only make sure OKRs are met. Just ask a manager how he helped his IC grow in past few years and how many engineers got promotions because of his guidance. Also, ask how many developers have left his team in the past year;\r\n\r\n- In my opinion, many internal systems are still immature, which leads to a lot of constant changes &amp; annoying routine work;\r\n\r\n- Once you set everything up for work, no boring week-long training on a very complex product - you are just given a task and from that moment on you are on your own.",

      "# [ThousandEyes Launches AI Tool To Predict and Fix Internet Outages by savio on 2024-06-06](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/news/thousandeyes-unveils-ai-tool-to-predict-and-fix-internet-outages/)\nThousandEyes, Cisco’s internet monitoring unit, has unveiled its new AI-powered tool, Digital Experience Assurance (DXA), designed to automatically predict and fix internet outages.\n\nThe company, which likens itself to the “Google Maps” of the internet, is enhancing its platform to offer proactive network quality and resilience measures for its customers.\n\nCisco’s ThousandEyes has launched Digital Experience Assurance (DXA), a set of AI-powered capabilities. This latest technology will monitor and predict network quality issues and fix them automatically to enhance the robustness of digital experiences. According to ThousandEyes, DXA allows customers to take preemptive measures on network problems, thus going beyond the traditional monitoring approach\n\nAccording to Joe Vaccaro, vice president and general manager of ThousandEyes, this technology allows businesses to solve certain issues before they affect users and even predict possible infrastructure problems. It utilizes massive datasets for forward-looking intelligence so that corporations can proactively deal with potential concerns before they cause significant degradation in digital experiences. Vaccaro stated that DXA went beyond metrics or simple measurements toward a closed-loop system that would optimize and remediate network performance with minimal manual intervention.\n\nThe company was founded 15 years ago and has invested heavily in AI technology in recent years. The DXA platform builds on ThousandEyes’ Event Detection technology, which reduces the time to detect disruption events to mere minutes, requiring fewer staff members. The new AI-driven features of DXA include capabilities for correlation, analysis, diagnosis, prediction, optimization, and remediation.\n\nRead More: Microsoft To Invest $3.2 Billion in Swedish Cloud and AI Infrastructure\n\nIn addition to the DXA launch, Vaccaro teased a forthcoming product that will leverage large language models similar to those used by generative AI systems like ChatGPT and Google Gemini. This new product is expected to enable users to generate AI-created scripts showing the status of global ISP networks, public cloud services, edge service networks, and application connections. ThousandEyes aims to provide even greater visibility and efficiency in managing internet and network infrastructures by automating these processes.\n\nMORE TECH NEWS",
      "# [Cisco-owned ThousandEyes launches AI to predict and fix internet outages, teases ChatGPT-style tech by Ryan Browne, www.facebook.com on 2024-06-04](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/04/thousandeyes-launches-ai-to-fix-internet-outages-teases-genai-tool.html)\nSurasak Suwanmake | Moment | Getty Images\n\nCisco's ThousandEyes internet monitoring unit on Tuesday unveiled new artificial intelligence-powered capabilities it said will allow for much faster prediction and diagnosis of internet outages and disruptions.\n\nThe company said its new AI tech, called Digital Experience Assurance, or DXA, would enable customers of Cisco's networking technology to introduce the ability to automatically act on issues in their network quality.\n\nThis is opposed to what is currently the case with ThousandEyes' software, where customers mostly only monitor their IT infrastructure for network issues.\n\n'Google Maps of the internet'\n\nCisco ThousandEyes terms itself the \"Google Maps\" of the internet. That's because it has a broad, end-to-end view of every user and any application over any network.\n\nFounded 15 years ago, the company says it's been investing lots into AI in the past several years.\n\nBut now, ThousandEyes is making big, AI-focused changes to its platform aimed at giving its client base even more visibility over network quality and resilience.\n\nJoe Vaccaro, vice president and general manager of ThousandEyes, said DXA would provide the ability \"not only to resolve issues before they begin to impact my users, but leverage broad data to actually begin to predict and give forward intelligence on what might happen across infrastructure, to proactively address it before it begins to significantly degrade overall digital experiences.\"\n\n\"Digital experience assurance helps to build upon this evolutionary journey beyond metrics, beyond monitoring, towards a platform that delivers on a closed loop system,\" Vaccaro told CNBC in an exclusive interview.\n\nAmong the other capabilities, DXA comes with are the ability for businesses to correlate, analyze, diagnose, predict, optimize, and remediate with little or no manual intervention.\n\nCisco ThousandEyes says its platform is powered by over 650 billion daily measurements collected from around the globe. The firm committed to giving businesses visibility into their internal environments, including on-premises networks and cloud environments.\n\nThe product builds on Cisco ThousandEyes' Event Detection tech, which the company says already reduces the time taken to detect a disruption event to mere minutes and less staffing, rather than hours and multiple engineers.\n\nAI-generated internet status reports\n\nVaccaro also teased the development of a new product at Cisco ThousandEyes that, once complete, would enable users to generate AI-create scripts showing the status of global ISP (internet service provider), public cloud, and edge service networks, or an application's connection a network.\n\nThis is similar to what ThousandEyes currently offers for internet monitoring, but with AI automatically doing the work rather than people.\n\n\"That is in development and should be seeing the light of day here in the very, very near future,\" Vaccaro told CNBC.\n\nThe product would incorporate large language models, which are considered the bedrock of generative AI systems like ChatGPT and Google Gemini.\n\nRacking up 100 million users to date, ChatGPT was catapulted into global virality just months after its creator OpenAI released it. The app's success stoked massive hype around artificial intelligence, with companies of all stripes making developments of their own in the space.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct the day of the announcement.",

      "# [Microsoft 365 Services Hit By Outage by Wade Tyler Millward](https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2024/microsoft-365-services-hit-by-outage)\nThis is at least the third major outage for Microsoft in July.\n\nDays after a faulty CrowdStrike update downed millions of Windows machines worldwide and a coincidental Microsoft Azure region outage in the United States, Microsoft has reported “access issues and degraded performance” for a variety of services and features under its Microsoft 365 umbrella.\n\nThe Redmond, Wash.-based cloud and AI tools vendor posted to X – formerly known as Twitter – at 5:48 a.m. Pacific Time on Tuesday that “we’re currently investigating access issues and degraded performance with multiple Microsoft 365 services and features,” according to the X post. “More information can be found under MO842351 in the admin center. The outage occurred just hours before Microsoft reports earnings for its fourth fiscal quarter.\n\nAt 7:51 a.m. Pacific, Microsoft added: “We’ve applied mitigations and rerouted user requests to provide relief. We're monitoring the service to confirm resolution and further information can be found at https://status.cloud.microsoft or under MO842351 in the admin center.” When a CRN reporter tried to access the cloud status website about 10 minutes after the X post, the reporter received a “site can’t be reached” error message.\n\n[RELATED: Microsoft Q4 2024 Earnings Preview: 5 Things To Know]\n\nMicrosoft 365 Outage\n\nCRN has reached out to Microsoft for comment.\n\nOn a Microsoft Azure Status website, the vendor said that “starting approximately at 11:45 UTC on 30 July 2024, a subset of customers may have experienced issues connecting to Microsoft services globally.”\n\n“We have implemented networking configuration changes and have performed failovers to alternate networking paths to provide relief,” according to the status page. Monitoring telemetry shows improvement in service availability from approximately 14:10 UTC onwards, and we are continuing to monitor to ensure full recovery.\n\nA chart breaking down the issues warned that users of any region in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) could face network infrastructure issues.\n\nOokla’s Downdetector website showed reports of M365 outages reaching a 24-hour high of 363 Tuesday around 6:22 a.m. Pacific. Azure outage reports reached a 24-hour high of 483 at around the same time.\n\nUsers in the “SysAdmin” Subreddit reported experiencing outages in Eastern Europe, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the Eastern U.S.\n\nSome users found humor in the situation. “Why does Team's never go down for me? An afternoon free of calls or messages would be lovely,” one user wrote, referring to Microsoft’s popular communications and collaboration platform.\n\nJuly 19 Outage\n\nThe outage does not appear related to the firestorm that has erupted since a faulty CrowdStrike update interfered with millions of Windows machines on July 19 – with some Windows users including Delta Air Lines still dealing with the effects of the outage days later.\n\nHours before the CrowdStrike incident, “Microsoft experienced an unrelated (outage) that affected access to various Azure services and customer accounts configured with a single-region service in the Central US region,” according to a July 26 blog post by Cisco subsidiary ThousandEyes.\n\n“This outage occurred around the same time as the CrowdStrike incident, from 9:56 PM (UTC) on July 18 to 12:15 PM (UTC) on July 19,” according to the post. “The close timing of the two incidents may have caused some confusion and led to the larger global IT outage being mistakenly attributed to Microsoft. Although Microsoft systems were affected during the CrowdStrike incident, it was completely unrelated to the Azure incident.”\n\nThe outage included “failures of service management operations and connectivity or availability of services,” with ThousandEyes saying that “connectivity into the Central US region appeared impaired, with forwarding loss being observed at the ingress points to the affected region … Among those impacted were Confluent, Elastic Cloud, and Microsoft 365.”\n\n“Microsoft’s status update also identified a configuration change as the underlying cause that impacted the connectivity of backend services, specifically storage clusters and compute resources. This then triggered some automated mitigation with services being restarted repeatedly.”\n\nThousandEyes also reported on an Azure issue July 13 that led to service interruptions for Grammarly.\n\n“Azure reported that the Azure OpenAI (AOAI) service has an automation system that is implemented regionally but uses a global configuration to manage the lifecycle for certain backend resources,” according to the report. “A change was made to update this configuration to delete unused resources in an AOAI internal subscription. There was a quota on the number of storage accounts on this subscription, which were unused and intended to be cleaned up to prevent storage quota pressure.”",
      "# [ThousandEyes Documentation on 2024-10-08](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/whats-new/changelog)\n2024-10-08\n\nWAN Insights Alerting\n\nThousandEyes now supports alerting for WAN Insights metrics such as capacity and site quality. To learn more, refer to the documentation pages at WAN Insights and ThousandEyes Alerts.\n\n2024-10-07\n\nImpact of Win11 24H2 on Endpoint Agent's Wi-Fi Reporting\n\nWith the recent Windows 11 version 24H2 release, if Start > Settings > Privacy > Location is set to Off, the Endpoint Agent will no longer be able to report SSID, BSSID, or wireless signal quality information for the currently associated Wi-Fi access point. This change stems from updated security privacy requirements in Windows, which require users to enable location services.\n\nThis change has the following impacts:\n\nIn the path trace visualization, the wireless node is not displayed.\n\nDetails of BSSID, SSID, and signal quality are no longer available.\n\nNo data is displayed under Agent Views > Wireless.\n\nInformation about neighboring access points is not accessible.\n\nIn the segment visualization, connection status is displayed as unknown.\n\nTo ensure you get the best experience with our product, we recommend that your administrators enable location services by default for your organization's endpoints.\n\n2024-10-04\n\nSamKnows Data Migration Announcement\n\nAs we continue to integrate SamKnows into Cisco ThousandEyes, over the coming months we will deliver a number of data and customer migration activities. These activities will not interrupt any services the platforms provide, but you may start to see some small changes, and some of these changes may require you to take action. We detail these below.\n\nData and customer migration will occur in two phases.\n\nPhase 1 - Migration of Database and Infrastructure\n\nBy December 2024, we aim to migrate all SamKnows databases and infrastructure from Google GCP to Amazon AWS (Frankfurt). These migrations will be staggered, with a small percentage of traffic being moved at each step.\n\nThere will be no changes to how you access SamKnows One (https://samknows.one) in this phase. However, you may need to take action on the following points:\n\nThe IP addresses of our API endpoints will change.\n\nAs part of the move to AWS, SamKnows API endpoints will move to new IP addresses provided by AWS. We are not changing the hostnames of our API endpoints, so if you only rely on the hostnames then these changes will be completely transparent to you.\n\nWhile we advise customers to avoid hard-coding IP addresses, we are aware that some customers may have done so in order to satisfy their own security requirements (e.g., configuring an outbound IP ACL). If IP addresses have been hard-coded, then once we switch IP addresses, you may have issues accessing SamKnows APIs.\n\nIf you are unsure whether your SamKnows IP addresses have been hard-coded, we recommend checking with your network and security teams in advance.\n\nThe first IP address change will occur on 4 November 2024; the remainder will follow over the coming weeks and conclude by mid December 2024. You will receive regular reminders and updates from your Customer Success representative to ensure you are informed of and prepared for the migrations.\n\nIf IP hard-coding is unavoidable for your organization, find below a table of the current and new IP addresses.\n\nSome automated emails will start to be sent from the thousandeyes.com domain\n\nSamKnows One sends some automated emails to customers. For example, large data exports may be generated asynchronously and you will receive a link via email. Currently, these emails all originate from a samknows.com email address. Starting 4 November 2024, these emails will begin to originate from a thousandeyes.com email address.\n\nIf your email system has any allowlist for samknows.com, then you should also add thousandeyes.com to this allowlist by 4 November to ensure you continue to receive these automated emails.\n\nThousandEyes will start to be referenced inside samknows.one\n\nSome of the API documentation and endpoints will migrate from the API reference on samknows.one to the API reference on Cisco Devnet, where ThousandEyes APIs are referenced. There is no technical change here; the existing endpoints will continue to function as before.\n\nPhase 2 - Migration of Customers from samknows.one to app.thousandeyes.com\n\nBeginning in January 2025, once Phase 1 has completed, we will hard-switch SamKnows One over to the ThousandEyes platform. At this point:\n\nYou will be redirected to https://app.thousandeyes.com if you visit SamKnows One. When logging into https://app.thousandeyes.com for the first time, you will be prompted to reset your password.\n\nYou will find the SamKnows product suite under the Connected Devices menu item within the ThousandEyes platform.\n\nWe will continue to update the changelog and communicate with you via email during this transition to remind you of the changes, and inform you of specific dates by when certain actions need to be taken to avoid losing access to your SamKnows resources.\n\n2024-10-03\n\nTemplates Can Now Be Grouped\n\nTest templates can now be grouped using the Templates API. This offers an additional layer of organization allowing you to view sub-sections within templates, and turn off individual tests as well as intra-template groups, all in the sidebar. For more details, see the Templates API Reference.\n\n2024-10-03 Bug Fixes\n\nFixed an issue where non-square icons rendered strangely for collections.\n\n2024-10-02\n\nIntroducing Adaptive Alert Detection\n\nWe are pleased to announce adaptive alert detection, a powerful enhancement to our alerting system that is now available to all customers. Adaptive alert detection better distinguishes genuine issues from potential alert noise for faster incident resolution. This makes it easier for users to maintain optimal network performance with minimal effort.\n\nKey Features and Enhancements:\n\nIntelligent alerting: adaptive alert detection leverages a sophisticated algorithm (patent pending) to deliver more accurate, context-aware alerts that adjust dynamically to real-time network conditions.\n\nMinimal configuration: default settings provide value right out of the box with automatic aggregation, minimizing the need for setup or fine-tuning.\n\nReduced false positives: smarter detection reduces multiple alerts for the same issue (flappy alerts), reducing false positives, and ensuring alerts are more meaningful.\n\nCustomizable sensitivity: teams can adjust alert sensitivity (high, medium, low) to receive more or fewer alerts to suit their specific environment needs.\n\nAdaptive alert detection is currently available for Cloud and Enterprise Agent alerts. It is the default alerting method for all new alerts for these agents. You can edit new and old alerts alike to use the manual or adaptive method.\n\nSee Adaptive Alert Detection for more information.\n\n2024-10-01\n\nFinal Reminder to Transition to Views 2.0\n\nViews 1.0 will now be removed from the ThousandEyes platform after October 8th, 2024. We encourage all users to finalize their transition to Views 2.0 as soon as possible in preparation for this change.\n\nWe appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this transition. Please reach out if you experience any issues or have concerns regarding this change. Our goal is to ensure a smooth and seamless experience for all users.\n\n2024-09-26\n\nIntroducing Endpoint Agent Views 2.0\n\nWe are pleased to announce Endpoint Agent Views 2.0, an upgrade designed to streamline troubleshooting and enhance the user experience. From help desk technicians to network engineers, this new view allows everyone to access comprehensive information related to a specific agent, enabling efficient resolution of end-user issues.\n\nKey Features and Enhancements:\n\nSegmented Visualization: Quickly identify where the problem lies by segmenting the end-to-end path based on its owner, helping technicians to quickly locate, escalate and resolve problems.\n\nSegment Scores: Provides a simplified view of network health, allowing users to assess the impact of issues at a glance.\n\nPer-Process Information: Offers detailed insights into CPU and memory usage by specific applications and processes, enabling targeted action to resolve performance issues.\n\nThis new version is available for all users in a limited preview and is labeled as Endpoint Agent Views 2.0. The existing version is labeled as Endpoint Agent Views 1.0, and users can toggle between the two versions.\n\nSee Endpoint Agent Views 2.0 for more information.\n\nPAC files are cached for a limited time, and reloaded on a five minute interval.\n\nIf the PAC file is updated with invalid content, the Enterprise Agent may fail (even if it was previously working). In this case, the agent will continue to fail until the PAC file error is corrected and the agent reloads the valid file.\n\nSAML-JIT Provisioning for ThousandEyes\n\nWe are pleased to announce the release of SAML just-in-time (JIT) provisioning for ThousandEyes. This feature allows for on-the-spot user creation and authentication using SAML, streamlining user management and ensuring up-to-date records. For detailed setup instructions and more information, please refer to the SAML JIT provisioning documentation.\n\nEnterprise Agent Public IP Address TTL Set to 30 Minutes\n\nAs previously announced, we have changed how ThousandEyes Enterprise Agents update their associated public IP addresses to avoid IP flapping. Agents now only update the public IP address of the agent when the prefix length differs, or after a platform-configured time-to-live (TTL) value elapses.\n\nThe TTL value is now set to 30 minutes.\n\n2024-09-25\n\nCloud Insights Limited Preview\n\nCloud Insights offers new capabilities for monitoring and troubleshooting cloud native and hybrid cloud environments. These new capabilities include:\n\nExtending test path visualization with display of the discovered cloud network topology.\n\nTracking cloud network configuration changes correlated with performance and availability measurements.\n\nVisualizing cloud traffic flow information over time. Cloud Insights currently supports AWS hosted applications and is available for evaluation until December 2024. For more details, please see Cloud Insights.\n\n2024-09-18\n\nAlpine Linux 3.20 Images Now Available\n\nWe have now released updated Docker for Linux container images that are based on Alpine 3.20. Moving forward, all container-based installation types for the ThousandEyes Enterprise Agent will be built against an Alpine base instead of an Ubuntu base. This conveys numerous advantages for customers, primarily due to the reduced size of the base image, which improves the performance of installation and upgrades, reduces the security footprint, and enables us to improve velocity for our engineering teams.\n\nThis has no impact on existing installs. New installations with the updated images will have the new base.\n\nConfigure Splunk HEC Exporter in ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry\n\nYou can now configure the following fields in the Splunk HEC exporter stream: token, source, sourceType, and index. For more details, visit the Splunk integration guide.\n\nWith the new capability to configure the Splunk HEC index, you can choose whether to export ThousandEyes telemetry data as events or metrics to Splunk. Learn more here.\n\nAdditionally, setting the Splunk HEC token in customerHeaders[\"token\"] is now deprecated. The token should be specified in exporterConfig.SplunkHec.token going forward. This functionality will be removed in 3 months.\n\n2024-09-18 Bug Fixes\n\nAn issue that was incorrectly showing interface metrics data in the Endpoint Agent view has been resolved. In particular, due to a misalignment in the data, sometimes we were showing data even when the agent was offline. The problem has been addressed, and now the data is properly shown.\n\nAn issue that was incorrectly associating Endpoint Agents with Endpoint labels when the submission of the agent data was delayed (e.g., agent loses connectivity to the Internet) has been resolved.\n\n2024-09-05\n\nAdd \"optional\" Field to the UserInput Model in Templates\n\nA new boolean field named “optional” has been added to the UserInput model to mark a given user input as optional. You can now create or edit a template with optional user inputs.\n\nSupport for Monitoring OpenAI\n\nTests in a template can now target the OpenAI API (api.openai.com). If the consumer of a template has an OpenAI API key, they can provide that as a user input, which can be used in the template for the API tests. However, the field is optional and is not required for deploying the template.\n\nEndpoint Agent Client Version 1.206.0\n\nThe following enhancements have been made to the Endpoint Agent client:\n\nAll Platforms\n\nPreviously, the agent only considered ICMP-based protocols for testing the AnyConnect underlay when the VPN used IPSEC-based connections. The agent will now consider TCP tests for such cases.\n\nThe compatibility of the Endpoint Agent Internet Explorer plug-in is improved when used with other third-party Internet Explorer plug-ins that use a different version of the Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime.\n\nThe agent has been updated to continue supporting the integration of Webex Control Hub with the latest Webex client release.\n\nAn issue has been resolved where the agent did not correctly consider the Zscaler PAC file and did not correctly identify bypassed targets.\n\nPreviously, when the agent conducted Webex calling dynamic tests, it could potentially use a different interface than the originally detected network flow. This has now been corrected, and the agent will consistently use the same interface for testing.\n\nImproved error reporting has been implemented for scheduled tests that target an HTTPS server via a proxy. If the proxy returns an HTTP error code, it is now reported as an \"HTTP\" error instead of a \"Receive\" error. Additionally, the HTTP error code reported by the proxy, along with the request and response headers, are now accessible for inspection.\n\n2024-09-05 Bug Fixes\n\nFixed an issue where the step indicator caused an unexpected scroll behavior by pushing the navigation buttons.\n\n2024-09-04\n\nAs previously announced in the August 1st, 2024 changelog, we have updated the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols and cipher suites for all ThousandEyes services.\n\nThe following changes are now in effect for all ThousandEyes services:\n\nAdded support for TLS 1.3 protocols, enabling more secure and efficient cryptographic handshakes.\n\nAll Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) ciphers from the TLS 1.2 suite will be removed due to their susceptibility to specific vulnerabilities.\n\nUpdated supported Cipher Suites:\n\nTLS 1.2: ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256, ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, and ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305.\n\nTLS 1.3: TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, and TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256.\n\nThis update ensures compliance with the latest security standards and best practices, reducing the risk of exposure to known vulnerabilities associated with CBC ciphers. Clients and integrations must support the aforementioned cipher suites to maintain compatibility with our application.\n\nEnterprise Agent Public IP Address Behavior Change\n\nPreviously, ThousandEyes Enterprise Agents have updated their associated public IP address on every check-in. However, this can cause the agent's IP to flap in some situations, so we have made a change to only update the public IP address of the agent when the prefix length differs or after a platform-configured time-to-live (TTL) value elapses.\n\nSendGrid Email-to-SMS Disabled\n\nDue to recent SendGrid policy changes, SendGrid no longer supports relaying messages to email-to-SMS addresses (for example, 1234567890@tmomail.net). This change affects customers who use this method for alert notifications.\n\nTo ensure uninterrupted alert delivery, we recommend you explore alternative notification channels while we work on finding new options to support SMS notifications.\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry Introduces Data Model v2\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry now supports data model v2. As part of this update, ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry now uses data model v2 as the default version. Both data model v1 and data model v2 remain available for use. For more details, refer to the ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry Data Model documentation.\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry Data Model Now Streams the test.name Attribute for Endpoint Tests\n\nThe test.name metric attribute is now included in OpenTelemetry streams for all ThousandEyes tests, including Endpoint Agent tests. Previously, this attribute was only available for Cloud and Enterprise Agent tests. For more information, see ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry Metrics.\n\n2024-09-03\n\nThousandEyes Physical and Virtual Appliances Now Run on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS\n\nThe base operating system for our ThousandEyes Physical Appliance (TEPA) images for Intel / ASUS NUCs and Raspberry Pi 4s, as well as our ThousandEyes Virtual Appliance (TEVA) images for VMware ESXi, VirtualBox, and Hyper-V, has been switched to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.\n\nWith this change, we've also updated the appliance customization in the Add Agents dialog to produce images with an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS base.\n\nThis has no impact on existing installations. All new installations with the updated images will have the new base operating system.\n\n2024-08-28\n\nMulti-Factor Authentication for User API Tokens\n\nSecurity is at the core of ThousandEyes values, and with the latest updates, we are introducing a significant enhancement to the security of user API tokens. Now, whenever a user needs to create, remove, or regenerate basic tokens or OAuth bearer tokens, they will need to enter the multi-factor authentication (MFA) code sent to their user email.\n\nFor more details, see User API Token.\n\nJava SDK v1.0.0\n\nThe Java API SDK v1.0.0 has been published and is now available to all customers. You can access these resources through the Maven Central portal. You can also access and contribute to our public GitHub repo.\n\nTo install a package from the SDK:\n\nFixed Values for BSSID and SSID in the UI for macOS 14.6\n\nAs reported earlier, we have implemented an interim solution to substitute the all-zero BSSID string and Unicode characters replacing SSID in reports by a fixed value in the format - Unknown SSID - Agent name/ Unknown BSSID -Agent name\n\n2024-08-28 Bug Fixes\n\nAn issue was found where classic webhook integrations were missing from the Notifications tab on the Endpoint Alert Rules page. This has been resolved.\n\n2024-08-21\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry Data Model Now Streams the test.name Attribute\n\nFor Cloud and Enterprise Agent tests, the test name is now included as the metric attribute test.name, exported using ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry. For more information, see ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry Metrics.\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry BGP Metrics Are Now Event-Driven\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry BGP metrics are now event-driven, which means that they will only be streamed when there is an update in the monitored prefixes. For more information, see ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry.\n\n2024-08-15\n\nRecommendations and Templates Now Appear Together on One Page\n\nPreviously when you selected Start Monitoring, recommendations and templates were shown separately. Now they are shown side by side for more convenience and improved usability.\n\nIntroducing the Unified Test Creation Workflow\n\nTo streamline the test-creation experience, we are continuing our rollout of the unified test creation workflow that began on June 20th. From the Test Settings screen, you can click Start Monitoring to begin your monitoring journey. This allows you to create a single test; or deploy from the test recommendations or built-in or user-defined templates.\n\nTo switch back to the original test creation UI, click Switch to Classic test creation. You can also create single test from the + button. For more information, see Templates: Select a Template via Start Monitoring.\n\nIntroducing ThousandEyes Connected Devices\n\nWe are excited to announce the general availability of our new Connected Devices suite of products and functionality. Known previously to many as SamKnows, this internet performance monitoring platform has taken up residence in ThousandEyes and is rebranded as Connected Devices.\n\nFitting squarely within ThousandEyes’ agent and test infrastructure, Connected Devices measures the crucial \"last mile\" of internet performance via new Device Agents and a host of new tests. The Device Agents live on routers and within mobile apps to enable network visibility down to the personal device level. The new range of tests allows measurements to be taken across all ThousandEyes test layers. In addition, the agents can simulate tests to real applications such as games, social media sites, and video conferencing services, for accurate quality-of-experience measurements against tools and services that end users really care about.\n\nConnected Devices also brings us Cisco Real Speed, a two-step speed test triggered from both the router and the personal device in real time that can help users and their broadband providers alike determine whether the cause of an issue is rooted inside the home or without – a serious new ally in addressing the age-old question of “is the problem inside or outside my home?”\n\nNote that test results are viewed from a new user interface on the ThousandEyes platform specially built for Connected Devices customers – they are not currently viewable on ThousandEyes Views screens.\n\nRead more about the many capabilities of Connected Devices, and how to view and analyze your test results, at Connected Devices.\n\nEach Device Agent requires a license. Some tests also require the purchase of units. Speak to your account manager about purchase options, and learn more about the pricing model at Device Agent Consumption Model.\n\nMap View Adjustment for Browser Tests\n\nThe map component in Views 2.0 has been rearranged so that Unique Agent Stats or the Agent Identifier is at the bottom of the map section. Duplicate and extraneous information in the Map section of page load and transaction tests has been removed.\n\nImpact of macOS 14.6 on Endpoint Agent's Wi-Fi Reporting\n\nWith the recent macOS 14.6 point release, the Cisco ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent can no longer report SSID or BSSID information for the currently associated Wi-Fi access point. This change stems from updated security privacy requirements in macOS, which require user consent to enable Location Services and opt-in to share location data with each application.\n\nThis change impacts:\n\nUser Interface:\n\nThe SSID and BSSID values are now displayed as an all-zero BSSID string and Unicode characters replacing SSID in reports.\n\nSSID is no longer populated in tables.\n\nThe Wireless Info section no longer displays SSID/BSSID details.\n\nThe Connection segment no longer shows SSID/BSSID information.\n\nAgents without SSID information will be grouped within Path Visualization.\n\nAgent Labels: Labels based on SSID/BSSID are no longer functional.\n\nData Tagging: Datapoints are not tagged correctly, affecting filtering.\n\nTest Assignments: Test assignments that rely on these labels are non-functional.\n\nWi-Fi Monitoring: Monitoring for Wi-Fi change events (e.g., channel swaps) may also be disrupted.\n\nWe're working on an interim solution to address the UI issues by the end of August, 2024, and will let you know about any further updates.\n\n2024-08-14\n\nProxy Settings Available for API Test Type\n\nProxy Metrics are now available for the API test type. Proxy settings were previously available for HTTP server, page load, and transaction tests.\n\nConfigure these settings in Cloud & Enterprise Agents > Test Settings under the Advanced Settings tab. When Perform network measurements to the proxy is checked, the Agent to Server layer in the API test type view shows proxy details, which appear as another node, as well as network layer metrics such as proxy loss, latency, and jitter.\n\nEndpoint Agent Client Version 1.203.4\n\nThe following enhancements have been made to the Endpoint Agent client:\n\nRoomOS\n\nThe agent has been updated to ensure ongoing support for the integration of Webex Control Hub with the latest release of the Webex client.\n\n2024-08-08\n\nEndpoint Agent Client Version 1.203.2\n\nThe following enhancements have been made to the Endpoint Agent client:\n\nAll Platforms\n\nFixed an issue where the agent ran dynamic tests for Webex Calling on a different interface than the originally detected network flow.\n\nFixed an issue with the network probes that prevented the agents from reporting system metrics such as CPU/Memory, Signal Quality, and Link Speed.\n\nPreviously, when auto-detect found that no modes were suitable for testing the target, it would return an incorrect probe mode. This has now been fixed to report the original mode if no testing is performed.\n\nThe agents' path tracing is improved when using a VPN.\n\nThe robustness of auto protocol detection is enhanced to counter frequently occurring network changes.\n\nThe agent will enforce a maximum database size for both, the system and the user agent.\n\nWindows\n\nThe unapproved NPCAP versions can be used by default to run te-diagnostics network tests.\n\nThe agent updates will continue to work even if the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is disabled.\n\nPreviously, when a user selected version 1.00 of NPCAP as an allowed NPCAP version, the agent would not support it. This has now been resolved, and the agent supports version 1.00 of NPCAP.\n\nRoomOS\n\nFixed an issue where an unresponsive DNS server could lead to increased memory usage.\n\n2024-08-07\n\nUpcoming Transition to Views 2.0\n\nWe are excited to announce that Voice (RTP and SIP), DNSSEC, DNS trace, and FTP tests are now fully supported for Views 2.0. With these final test types supported, we will be making changes to how users interact with test views on our platform:\n\nAt the end of August, 2024, the option to set Views 1.0 as the default preference will be removed. All tests will be presented in Views 2.0 by default.\n\nUsers will still have the ability to manually click \"Open Views 1.0\" to view a test until October 1st, 2024. However, this change will only apply to the selected test during the active browser session.\n\nOn October 1st, 2024, Views 1.0 will be removed from the ThousandEyes platform. After this date, the \"Open Views 1.0\" option will not be available, and all tests will exclusively use Views 2.0.\n\nWe appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this transition. Please reach out if you experience any issues or have concerns regarding this change. Our goal is to ensure a smooth and seamless experience for all users.\n\n2024-08-05\n\nEnd of Support for Skype for Business\n\nWe are deprecating support for Skype for Business, as the upstream service has now been deprecated by Microsoft. The functionality will be removed from all voice tests within ThousandEyes on November 5th, 2024.\n\n2024-08-01\n\nIn our ongoing efforts to maintain the highest security standards, we are updating the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols and cipher suites for all ThousandEyes services.\n\nAfter September 2nd, 2024, the following changes will be in effect for all ThousandEyes services:\n\nAdded support for TLS 1.3 protocols, enabling more secure and efficient cryptographic handshakes.\n\nAll Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) ciphers from the TLS 1.2 suite will be deprecated due to their susceptibility to specific vulnerabilities.\n\nUpdated supported Cipher Suites:\n\nTLS 1.2: ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256, ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, and ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305.\n\nTLS 1.3: TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, and TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256.\n\nThis update ensures compliance with the latest security standards and best practices, reducing the risk of exposure to known vulnerabilities associated with CBC ciphers. Clients and integrations must support the aforementioned cipher suites to maintain compatibility with our application.\n\nWe encourage all users to verify their systems' compatibility and make any necessary adjustments to continue enjoying secure communications with our application.\n\nTo improve the explainability of the widget for executives and team members, you can now save a description for any dashboard widget in ThousandEyes. Select Widget Settings add a description, and then save it.\n\nPython API SDK Release\n\nThe Python API SDK has been published and is now available to all customers, and you can access resources through PyPi. You can also access and contribute to our public GitHub repo. Installing a package from the SDK is as simple as running pip install thousandeyes-sdk-usage.\n\nNew Cloud Agents\n\nNew Cloud Agents have been added in the locations listed below. For a full list of Cloud Agents, see ThousandEyes Cloud Agent Locations.\n\nBarcelona, Spain (Vodafone)\n\nBarcelona, Spain (Vodafone) (IPv6)\n\nBelo Horizonte, Brazil (Vivo)\n\nBelo Horizonte, Brazil (Vivo) (IPv6)\n\nBerlin, Germany (Vodafone)\n\nBerlin, Germany (Vodafone) (IPv6)\n\nFrankfurt, Germany (Deutsche Telecom)\n\nFrankfurt, Germany (Deutsche Telecom) (IPv6)\n\nSantiago, Chile (Movistar)\n\nSantiago, Chile (Movistar) (IPv6)\n\nNew Azure Data Center Cloud Agents\n\nQuerétaro, Mexico (Mexico Central)\n\n2024-08-01 Bug Fixes\n\nAn issue that was not correctly applying the highlighting filtering in the Network Topology section of the Endpoint Views page has been resolved. The filtering is now correctly applied in the path view, and the nodes are properly highlighted when matching the condition.\n\nAn issue that was not correctly propagating the version 1.00 of the NPCAP library has been fixed. The Advanced Agent Settings tab for Endpoint Agent settings now includes the ability to define the allowed NPCAP versions for Endpoint Agents.\n\n2024-07-22\n\nDashboard Templates for Endpoint Agent\n\nYou can now deploy dashboards using designated templates to monitor the end-user experience, diagnose overall network and application health, and streamline troubleshooting. You can learn more about deploying them in Dashboard Templates.\n\nThis release introduces the following Endpoint Agent dashboard templates:\n\nHome Worker Dashboard\n\nEnd User Helpdesk Dashboard\n\nEnd User Wireless Health Dashboard\n\nEnd User Localized Issues Dashboard\n\nEnd User Health Overview Dashboard\n\nEnd User Office vs Remote Dashboard\n\nEnd User Detailed Wireless Health Dashboard\n\n2024-07-16\n\nTo enhance system performance and streamline management, we have set a limit of 1,000 elements (an element is defined as each option you can add to a filter used to describe the label) for each Endpoint Agent label. This limit can comfortably accommodate the typical use of the Endpoint Agent labels. It will be enforced for all new and modified labels in the future, while pre-existing labels that surpass this threshold will remain unaffected. You can continue to employ and adjust these labels, albeit without the ability to expand the number of elements beyond the current value.\n\n2024-07-08\n\nNear Real-Time BGP Monitoring and Alerting\n\nOur BGP tests and alerting is being upgraded to near real-time, shifting from 15-minute intervals to 1-minute intervals after July 9, 2024, enabling quicker detection and response to BGP issues. Existing alert rules will automatically convert to the new format, with customized configurations now available based on time rather than round-based alerting. Users are advised to review and adjust their alert settings post-transition for optimal monitoring, with the v6 and v7 API endpoints being updated to include a new time field. Correction: Customers will be updated in batches through the end of the month.\n\nPrevious Announcement\n\nCreating and Editing Alert Rules\n\n2024-06-27\n\nNew Makeover for ThousandEyes\n\nAs announced previously, we have updated the ThousandEyes look and feel across our platform to better align with Cisco standards. This change includes redesigning our headers, left-hand navigation, icons, font, and typography, without affecting functionality. These changes will provide our customers with a consistent experience when they switch among Cisco Cloud products, and an improved modern user interface. Learn more about the UI changes from this video tutorial.\n\nEndpoint Agent Client Version 1.200.0\n\nThe following enhancements have been made to the Endpoint Agent client:\n\nAll Platforms\n\nIn certain cases, an issue prevented the Endpoint Agent from collecting local network and device metrics, such as Gateway, DNS, System CPU, and System Memory. The Endpoint Agent now identifies these cases and attempts to work around the issue.\n\nThe memory required for the Endpoint Agent installed on the Linux platform to run the network test has been reduced.\n\nAdditional information is included while reporting the cause of network probe failures to provide more clarity.\n\nPreviously, the agent used to crash when reading certain values from the database. This issue has been fixed.\n\nPreviously, the agent could see a false negative of 100% loss when running HTTP tests, the root cause was that an incorrect port was being discovered. This has now been corrected.\n\nThe diagnostics tool now supports extended UDP STUN testing to targets, aiding in diagnosing issues with the agent.\n\nFixed an issue that caused Real User Tests not to report all pages when a large number of monitored domains were visited simultaneously from a browser with the Endpoint extension installed.\n\nWindows\n\nFixed an issue that prevented the uninstallation of the agent after deployment using an MSI transformation file to apply the account information.\n\nmacOS\n\nThe macOS UI installation process has been enhanced to allow users to add the connection string and other account information post successful agent installation.\n\nPreviously, the agent was capturing and redirecting the stdout and stderr to files, which could under certain conditions grow unbounded. The agent no longer redirects stdout and stderr.\n\n2024-06-25\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry API Now Supports Data Streaming to Splunk\n\nWe've added support for streaming data from ThousandEyes to Splunk Cloud Platform and Splunk Enterprise using the ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry API. For more information, see Configuring ThousandEyes for Splunk Cloud or Enterprise Using the API.\n\n2024-06-21\n\nNew Makeover for ThousandEyes\n\nOn June 27th 2024, we will update the look and feel of our entire platform to better align with Cisco standards. This change includes redesigning our headers and left-hand navigation as well as updating our icons, fonts, and typography, all while avoiding any change in functionality. The changes will provide our customers with a consistent experience when switching between Cisco Cloud products and an improved modern user interface.\n\nAPI V6 End of Life Notification\n\nThis is a reminder about the end-of-life of API v6. API v6 will no longer be supported as of May 27th, 2025.\n\nOur v7 API introduces new capabilities for developers and DevOps-focused customers, ranging from standardization to performance and improved documentation. It aims to deliver a single cohesive API surface for all ThousandEyes product areas. The goal of our v7 API is to simplify and improve use cases while increasing interoperability with tools common to operations workflows.\n\nAccording to our API support policy, prior versions of our API are supported for one year, following an initial 90-day notification period.\n\nImproved Network Path Topology in Internet Insights\n\nIn Internet Insights' network topology screen, we have improved the differentiation between a node experiencing an outage and a node affected by the outage. This enhancement is intended to make it easier to understand where the source of an outage is coming from and where that outage is having impact on other network nodes. To learn more about this enhancement, see Network Outages Topology Tab.\n\nImproved UI for Endpoint Alert Rule Configuration\n\nUsers will see a new UI for the Alert Rules > Endpoint Agents page. This UI will make alert rule configuration more intuitive, with better performance and load times.\n\nIn Views 2.0, the page load tests summary now presents the following metrics, consistent with Views 1.0:\n\nDOM Load Time\n\nPage Load Time\n\nLoss and Latency Shown by Default in Views 2.0 for Network Outages and Network Events\n\nEarlier, when investigating network-based events, the redirection of the affected tests only selected loss as the metric of focus. However, network events can also be due to sudden spikes in latency. Therefore, now both loss and latency are selected by default when you view the affected tests from an event.\n\nPage load and transaction tests now support loading web pages that use WebGL. For web pages that trigger a browser-native notification, transaction tests now bypass these notifications.\n\nImprovements to Dashboard Filters\n\nImprove the Enabled/Included Dashboard Views We have enhanced the selection helper sidebar for the Tests dashboard filter. We have improved how to view only the tests that were selected in widgets and how to view only enabled tests.\n\nAdd Remaining Filter Values to Dashboard Filters Dashboard filters have expanded and are available for any variable that is applicable to a widget on an existing dashboard. If the combination of dashboard filters applied for a given data source is not intersectional, the widget notifies the user to adjust the filters.\n\nWidget Filters When a Widget Is \"Locked\"\n\nThe behavior of locked widget filters has been streamlined. When filters are locked for a given widget, only the widget filters are used, and the widget ignores any dashboard-level filters.\n\nContext Tooltips for Events\n\nIn order to better understand each event type, we have now added tooltips explaining each event type in the event detail.\n\nIncrease Available Stream Integrations per Account Group\n\nThe maximum amount of Stream Integrations per account group has been increased from 1 to 5, allowing you to create more streams to suit your needs.\n\nEndpoint Agent: Generic Installers to Replace Custom Installers\n\nAs announced previously, the customized links for the Endpoint Agent installers will no longer be available. Instead, generic installers will be used. The ThousandEyes UI section for creating customized installers is marked as Deprecated and will no longer be available after June 20, 2024. You can continue to use the old installers indefinitely. However, we recommend that you shift to the new generic installers.\n\nDocument Network Path Topology Enhancement for Internet Insights\n\nInternet Insights has improved the differentiation in the network topology screen between a node experiencing an outage and a node ‘affected by’ the outage. This enhancement is intended to make it easier to understand where the source of an outage is coming from and where that outage is having impact on other network nodes. To learn more about this enhancement, see Network Outages Topology Tab.\n\nServiceNow Incident Management Integration Support for Newest Versions\n\nWe have updated the ServiceNow Incident Management integration with ThousandEyes to support the latest versions, including the Utah, Vancouver, and Washington DC builds. Our documentation has also been updated to reflect the steps required for these latest versions.\n\nUbuntu 22.04 Support\n\nThousandEyes now supports installing Enterprise Agents on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (code name \"Jammy Jellyfish\", or just \"Jammy\"). For support dates, see the Enterprise Agent Support Lifecycle.\n\nBug Fixes\n\nResolved timestamp inconsistencies for PDF exports of dashboards.\n\nFixed an issue where the dashboard selector list was not surfaced in the expected order of most recent to oldest.\n\nFixed a bug that was showing inconsistent availability metrics for the scheduled tests in the Agent View. In particular, the availability was showing the opposite value (i.e., 0% when it was 100%).\n\nThe list of agents assigned to an Endpoint Agent test was not correctly sorted when more than 10 agents were assigned. The Edit Test side panel from the Endpoint Test Settings section now correctly sorts the agents assigned to a test.\n\nFixed a cosmetic bug that was incorrectly showing the agents running a test. When clicking a specific test in the Test Settings tab from the Endpoint Agents section, the user is able to see the amount of agents assigned to that test and the agents that are actually running that test. The Agents running the tests value was incorrectly computed and has been corrected.\n\nFixed a bug that was not showing the labels assigned to each agent in the Endpoint Agent Settings section with some screen size/resolution ratios. The user should now always be able to see the labels independently of the conditions of the screen.\n\nFixed a bug that was reporting \"No items available!\" when using special characters in the search of SSID and BSSID filters in the Endpoint Agent. User should now be able to search for those SSID and BSSID that include special characters.\n\nTo keep consistency with the rest of ThousandEyes UI, when clicking on a link that redirects the user to another area within ThousandEyes (e.g., \"Open in Views\" or \"Open in Agent Views\" when selecting a specific agent), the new area will be opened on the same browser tab instead of opening a new one.\n\nNew Cloud Agents\n\nBeijing, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nBeijing, China (China Telecom) (IPv6)\n\nBeijing, China (China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nChangsha, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nChengdu, China (IPv6)\n\nChengdu, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nChongqing, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nDalian, China (China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nFoshan, China (IPv6)\n\nGuangzhou, China (IPv6)\n\nGuangzhou, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nGuangzhou, China (China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nJinan, China (China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nNanjing, China (IPv6)\n\nNingbo, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nShanghai, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nShanghai, China (China Telecom) (IPv6)\n\nShanghai, China China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nShenyang, China (China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nShenzhen, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nShenzhen, China (China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nShijiazhuang, China (China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nTianjin, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nWenzhou, China (China Telecom) (IPv6)\n\nWuhan, China (China Telecom) (IPv6)\n\nWuxi, China (IPv6)\n\nXi'an, China (China Telecom) (IPv6)\n\nZhengzhou, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nFrankfurt, Germany (Vodafone)\n\nFrankfurt, Germany (Vodafone) (IPv6)\n\nPorto Alegre, Brazil\n\nLima, Peru\n\nSantiago, Chile\n\n2024-06-20\n\nIntroducing Unified Test Creation Workflow\n\nTo streamline the test creation experience, we will gradually introduce the new Unified Test Creation workflow starting June 20th. From the test settings, you can click on the Start Monitoring button to begin your monitoring journey. This allows you to create a single test or deploy from the built-in or user-defined templates.\n\nWe are also introducing suggestion cards to surface any available recommendations and integrations. These cards offer actions you can take to enhance your existing monitoring. Click the Set up Recommneded Tests card to find any discovered test recommendations and start deployment.\n\nTo switch back to the original test creation UI, click the “Switch to Classic test creation” button. For more information, see Templates: Select a Template via Start Monitoring.\n\n2024-06-18\n\nNew Bell Notifications and Improvements\n\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to improve user experience, we have added several new features to the \"bell\" notifications. These include:\n\nIndividual notifications can now be dismissed via the x button beside them in the notifications list.\n\nAll notifications can now be dismissed by clicking the new Dismiss All button.\n\nSome notifications are now contextual to the relevant account group, and will only appear in the notifications list when logged in to that account.\n\nThree new notification types have also been added:\n\nIntegrations available (only shows up if you don't have any integrations configured).\n\nRecommended Tests available (if you have an integration configured).\n\nYou have tests in a draft state.\n\nThese notifications will only be visible to users with the required permissions for setting up/configuring integrations and tests. In addition, they will only appear once every two of months, and will disappear after 7 days (unless dismissed before then). For tests in a draft state, notifications appear every 7 days as long as there are tests matching this state.\n\nFor more information about the bell notification, see Glossary: Bell Notification.\n\n2024-06-14\n\nIntroducing Near Real-time BGP Monitoring and Alerting\n\nThousandEyes will release near real-time BGP monitoring and alerting. BGP tests will have the ability to be run at a 1-minute interval (as compared to the current 15-minute interval). This means that Views for BGP tests will also show BGP test results in 1-minute windows. For alerting, the current 15-minute, round-based alerting will shift to the new time-based format capable of alerting at 1-minute intervals. We'll start rolling this out in batches in early July.\n\nTo enhance the tagging system at ThousandEyes, we will migrate all existing labels to tags in the backend. Unlike single-valued labels siloed by product area, tags are dynamic with key-value pairs that can be associated with multiple assets across products under a shared tag.\n\nStarting June 24, 2024, when you query for tags using the v7 API (e.g., /v7/tags), all labels will be listed in a tags format key:value. For example, an existing label with the value webex will be displayed as webex:webex, with the value duplicated as the key.\n\nLabels that were migrated to tags will include a field in the API response called legacyID, indicating that this tag was originally a label and was then migrated. legacyId corresponds to the numeric ID assigned to the original label. Tags that were created natively will have an empty value in the legacyID field in the API response. Tags are currently supported for CEA Tests, CEA Agents, Endpoint Scheduled Tests, and Dashboards. Tags are not applicable to Endpoint Agents.\n\nPlease note that this change is only visible via the API. The UI will continue to display labels as they are, and tags created using the API will not yet be visible in the UI. This will be updated when we introduce tags in the UI in a future release.\n\n2024-06-13\n\nIntroducing Enhanced Onboarding\n\nEnhanced Onboarding allows new ThousandEyes customers to onboard quickly and easily with personalized monitoring coverage recommendations based on email domains and best practice guides. In addition, you can select, configure, and deploy a wide range of certified templates. The process concludes with setting up notifications and integrations. Enhanced Onboarding guides new customers through every step, providing a seamless and tailored onboarding experience. To learn more about Templates, see Templates\n\n2024-06-11\n\nCreate Templates in UI\n\nYou can now create, edit and delete templates directly in the UI. You can modify the JSON contents of templates using a template editor in the UI, which includes syntax highlighting and intellisense to make editing and creating templates easier and less error prone than using the API. If you don't want to create a template from scratch, you can duplicate existing ThousandEyes templates and edit them. The template editor also supports editing and deleting templates. Note that editing or deleting built-in ThousandEyes templates is not supported.",
      "# [Cisco Live: ThousandEyes on the prize in digital experience age by Joe O’Halloran, Deanna Darah, Jim Frey on 2024-06-07](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366587993/Cisco-Live-ThousandEyes-on-the-prize-in-digital-experience-age)\nAs it closed out its annual gathering of customers, partners and developers, networking and IT giant Cisco emphasised what it said would be a market-defining moment for the company and a bedrock of providing the resilience and reliability of networks for businesses as they work in the era of Digital Experience Assurance.\n\nEarlier at the event in Las Vegas, Cisco said that by using telemetry data and artificial intelligence (AI)-native technology, customers can now achieve digital resilience and transition from reactive to proactive operations by assuring user digital experience across domains for both owned and unowned environments.\n\nTo achieve its aims, it announced the launch of ThousandEyes Digital Experience Assurance to deliver AI-native assurance capabilities across Cisco Networking, including AI radio resource management (RRM), capacity planning for SD-WAN solutions, and device profiling with AI-based signatures for Cisco Identity Services Engine.\n\nAs the company staked out its ground in observability, Tom Casey, senior vice-president and general manager for products and technology at Splunk, recently acquired by Cisco, stressed that observability needed to cover multiple dimensions, across owned and unowned networks, running traditional and modern appliances and over on-premise equipment, multicloud and hybrid domains.\n\nHe added that Splunk would be focused on doing two things simultaneously: integrating products to leverage the skills in the Cisco and Splunk community; and enabling people to work together better.\n\n“We’re going to reach across the breadth of traditional and cloud-native applications, and in particular, those multicloud deployments that exist because the real world is a crazy, mixed up, heterogeneous place. We’re going to continue to need to [reach] customers where they are and incorporate the old with the new,” he said.\n\n“On the integration front, we’re going to focus on improving the user experience. [The aim is to] get more people engaged and let them manage and operate, hopefully in an effective way. Then we’re going to take secondary paths and work on deepening the connection into the network more consistently with ThousandEyes … the key thing is navigability across [the network] because you don’t know who’s going to notice [a network] incident and … how many teams you’re going to [need to work] simultaneously. The idea that you can converge your ITOps or security, your SRE, at the same point on shared context is critically important.”\n\nResponsible for the vision and direction of the division since April 2024, Joe Vaccaro, ThousandEyes general manager and vice-president, told Computer Weekly that from the beginnings of the company 14 years ago, almost 10 years before becoming part of the Cisco fold, the firm had the foresight to understand that the internet was going to fundamentally change connectivity. Cloud infrastructure hadn’t even really started, key cloud services and software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications were still in their infancy.\n\nFast forward to the present, with cloud and SaaS now central to how businesses operate, in the new world of hybrid working more and more of the digital experiences firms are facing are beyond the control of the IT organisation. Digital experiences now power everything that firms do, and ensuring these are resilient and can be assured explains the mission of ThousandEyes, noted Vaccaro, one that is more than just network monitoring.\n\n“The network in the connectivity is foundational, but other important parts of that digital supply chain all have to work together to deliver on a digital experience. That’s why ThousandEyes is much more than just networking. You need to understand the digital experience from understanding the device,” he said.\n\n“You need to understand it in terms of the DNS and set of surfaces. You also need to understand how configuration is going into play a role and how digital experiences can be delivered – and unfortunately also disrupted. We can see a drop in digital experience that many times is human caused, meaning somebody made a configuration [error], potentially to improve the security posture, that’s going to have a ripple effect in the overall digital experience,” added Vaccaro.\n\nPutting the ThousandEyes mission and vision into perspective in the digital experience age, Vaccaro said there were three core pillars: “We want to be able to empower our customers to see everything across that complex digital supply chain, the global area network. We want them to be able to process and understand the data and turn that data into intelligence so that they very quickly see and understand how the digital experience differs across the variety of different places where it’s being measured so they can focus on where they need to be able to diagnose and ultimately remediate the problem. And the third is to turn that into intelligence and actions, meaning they need to provide a set of closed loop operations. Because if you know you have a problem, but you’re not able to address that problem, then you haven't solved it [and delivered] on the outcome. Do you feel empowered to be resilient to all of your digital experiences?”\n\nIndeed, Vaccaro regards the notion of digital resilience as the ultimate outcome. It means that equipped with the appropriate tools and technology, businesses can now see outages that traditionally might have taken days or weeks taken down to minutes. Moreover, they are able to look at their connectivity infrastructure and find ways to proactively address problems before they impact their users.\n\nThe work of American professional wrestling promoter World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) was offered as a real-life example of these principles in action. A global business, its digital experiences – in particular streaming video transmission to services such as Peacock, and from next year Netflix – are delivered 24/7 and any disruption to that can cost millions of dollars instantly. Plus, brand damage. That means the company has to look at its complex digital supply chain between events.\n\nAt Cisco Live, WWE director of broadcast IT, Ralph Riley explained that this chain begins with a TV production studio in Stamford, Connecticut, in the US, where it has its corporate office, and then it also has outside broadcast trucks that transmit video from around the world. Keeping things up and running is simply fundamental, he said.\n\n“We are an operation that really never stops. In order for us to be as resilient as possible, we need to make sure that [in] our TV studio, our internet service providers and our connections through them are [operating] at top-notch bandwidth speeds at all times. Well, of course things aren’t always like that in a real professional world. I think more than ever, to be resilient in technology and an infrastructure that’s not up all the time is not easy,” said Riley.\n\n“And when you think about where we were years ago with antiquated infrastructure, antiquated technology, you were kind of just placing all your bets in one area. But now with Cisco technology, especially with ThousandEyes, it has been a blessing for us to be able to reduce the time it takes to find issues and be proactively alerted to them,” he added.\n\n“We have a Cisco Nexus environment in our TV studio and we also have access points on the road. But for us right now, in terms of the road infrastructure popping up all the time, ThousandEyes allows us to see that point-to-point between our agents on the road and our agents in the TV production studio. And again, before we were getting calls from our remote engineer saying, ‘Hey, something’s wrong, something’s down, what’s going on?’ And then you know, we’re scratching our heads. We didn’t have visibility into that infrastructure, but now, because of ThousandEyes agents, [we do]. We’re trying to run dashboards with ThousandEyes with a shared dashboard between all of our teams… We can see what’s important to us … and the road team can see what’s important to them. So, by creating those dashboards, we’re able to utilise a proactive point of entry for anyone to monitor and that’s been a game-changer.”\n\nFor Vaccaro, WWE exemplifies the vision of moving beyond monitoring and towards digital experience assurance. “To become resilient, you need to first have that full visibility. Our visibility is vendor agnostic, and that continues to be important because the internet is the world’s largest network of networks, and it’s made up of every vendor in the world, so our visibility needs to be agnostic and open,” he said.\n\n“You need to be resilient to understand the digital experiences that power our communities and schools. A hospital can’t deliver patient care without its network. A grocery store can’t enable people to get the food they need without its network and digital experiences.”",

      "# [ThousandEyes Report: Top Cloud Outages of 2023 by Zeus Kerravala on 2024-03-13](https://www.eweek.com/news/top-cloud-outages-2023/)\neWEEK content and product recommendations are editorially independent. We may make money when you click on links to our partners. Learn More.\n\nTo say the cloud is important to how we work, live, and play is a major understatement – the cloud is now a critical element of tech infrastructure. However, what underlies these outages is often a mystery. That’s why I was intrigued by a recent webcast from ThousandEyes, which looked under the covers at the major cloud outages of 2023.\n\nHosted by Brian Tobia, ThousandEyes’ Lead Technical Marketing Engineer, the webcast included a look at the anatomy of an outage. “It’s important to understand the different types of outages we see,” he said. “Understanding them can help you understand how to mitigate some of their impact.” He said outages could vary in the blast radius, whether they’re planned or unplanned, and their mean time to recovery.\n\nLet’s take a look at what caused the year’s major cloud outages – and what we can learn from these unfortunate incidents.\n\nDifferent Types of Cloud Outages\n\n“The distributed architecture of today’s applications means there are a lot of different moving parts that need to be orchestrated for something to actually work,” Tobia said. “And a lot of these parts are often single points of failure. Because they’re reused in multiple applications, like an API or a common service, we can see the impact of an outage more widely felt, despite it being a single service.”\n\nTobia noted that tracking cloud computing outages can help teams identify patterns and prevent customer service disruptions.\n\nLooking at the ThousandEyes report from 2023, Tobia said there were many different types of outages. “Overall, we still saw the most common type being ISP-related outages,” he said. “But we saw that there was an increase in CSP outages in 2023 compared to the previous years.”\n\nIn 2023, the number of US-centric outages increased from 34% to 37% and minor outages became more common. “We’re seeing that these smaller, more contained outages are becoming more common,” he said. “Before, there were traditionally a lot of bigger network outages—like really big ones—that would take down a whole bunch of services. But now we’re also seeing smaller ones.”\n\nBut even a cloud outage that starts in the US due to maintenance activity at night can cascade into other geographies in the middle of their business days.\n\nApplication Outages On the Rise\n\nTobia said that application outages, which continued to rise in 2023, can have a greater impact. A network outage will affect a single provider, but not so for applications. “The application outage really cascades because a bunch of people are relying on that one application,” he said. “It doesn’t matter what network you’re coming from.”\n\nHe then moved on to look at some outage examples from 2023, focusing on how ThousandEyes works. “We’re able to collect all this data through ThousandEyes,” he said. “Being able to correlate that and collect all this data, it’s really important to get the end-to-end picture of where an outage might occur. And then, also really important, correlate that across every layer.”\n\nHe added that ThousandEyes can show users every layer of a connection, whether it’s related to border gateway protocol (BGP), networks, applications, HTTP errors, or page load times.\n\nTop Cloud Outages of 2023\n\nTobia detailed the list of 2023 outages, including:\n\nA 90-minute outage for Microsoft on January 25: This was due to BGP changes that caused network issues. “This was total chaos from a BGP perspective,” Tobia said.\n\nA two-hour outage for Outlook on February 7: This resulted in service unavailable/application errors. “The last outage was more around some changes on their ISP routers and other WAN routers,” he said. “This may have been more on the application side.”\n\nA seven-hour Virgin Media outage on April 4: This outage arose because of a BGP route withdrawal that caused network traffic loss. “It was kind of similar to what we saw on the on the Microsoft side, when those BGP changes were occurring,” he said. “Without a route to the Virgin Media UK network, a lot of the Internet and transit providers dropped the traffic.”\n\nA two-hour AWS cloud outage on June 14: This outage caused latency, server timeouts, and HTTP errors. “They eventually identified the issue as being part of their capacity management system located within US-EAST-1,” he said. “And this impacted services like Lambda API gateway, and the actual management console itself, Global Accelerator.”\n\nA two-hour Slack cloud outage on August 2: As a result of this outage, users couldn’t send or receive messages. “Network paths were totally fine,” he said. “We didn’t see any packet loss, latency, or anything like that. So it was purely an application or client issue.”\n\nAn 18-hour Square cloud outage on September 8: This outage resulted in app errors and backend transactions failing. “This outage prevented it from processing transactions,” he said. “So end users were actually able to submit a transaction – some sellers who were using this to receive payments were successful, [but some users] reported connections dropping out or things not working.”\n\nA 36-hour Workday/Cloudflare outage that started on November 2: A complete power failure at a Cloudflare data center caused application and service issues. “Cloudflare was the provider and Workday was an application that runs on Cloudflare infrastructure,” he said. He noted that DR resources took 6 hours to come online. “So there was a complete outage until that facility came online,” he added. “It was able to serve requests at a diminished rate and then full resolution didn’t happen until more than 36 hours later.”\n\nBottom Line: Need for Monitoring to Prevent Cloud Outages\n\nIt was a busy year! Clearly, Tobia’s examples of cloud outages were sobering. Who thought a full power outage was possible today with the sophisticated data centers that providers like Cloudflare run? But they still had to deal with the arduous process of getting their DR up and running and working with a power company that may not move at the fastest pace.\n\nTobia’s presentation also underscored the importance of monitoring resources to understand what happens when a service goes down so that one can learn and avoid repeating the same mistakes.\n\nUnfortunately, for most businesses, having a backup for every cloud service the organization uses would be fiscally challenging. For support, IT leaders can use data from companies like ThousandEyes to make uptime part of the evaluation criteria.",

IT staff could then drill down to look for trouble within applications or network devices.\n\nCisco's integration plans for Splunk have piqued the interest of the Las Vegas Valley Water District (LVVWD). The utility is a customer of Cisco's operational technology (OT) business.\n\nLVVWD's IT department is watching Cisco's rollout of its Splunk strategy closely, said Brad Callihan, OT systems and compliance manager.\n\n\"We're analyzing where Splunk is at and what the integration to the Cisco platform does for us as an organization,\" Callihan said. The utility uses Microsoft Azure Sentinel, a security information and event management system.\n\nApproximately half of Cisco's revenue last year came from its networking products, so many of its customers will be interested in the company's use of Splunk. Today, many network engineers use vendor-agnostic management tools, including Broadcom, LiveAction, Paessler, PathSolutions, Riverbed and SolarWinds, said Shamus McGillicuddy, an analyst at Enterprise Management Associates.\n\n\"People with multi-vendor networks, which is pretty much everybody, don't really think of [Cisco] as managing their entire network,\" McGillicuddy said.\n\nHow far Cisco will go into managing multi-vendor environments and whether Splunk can play a role remains to be seen.\n\nCisco AI Assistant\n\nPart of Cisco's product integration strategy includes an AI Assistant it plans to launch this year. Rather than build separate assistants for each product, Cisco plans to have one and will build in specific capabilities for networking, security and observability.\n\nCisco hasn't provided many details, but Bob Laliberte, principal analyst at theCUBE Research, said Splunk could play a key role.\n\n\"The whole premise of AI is to take data and convert it into intelligence or knowledge,\" Laliberte said. \"Splunk is that one data management piece they can feed everything into.\"\n\nAntone Gonsalves is an editor at large for TechTarget Editorial, reporting on industry trends critical to enterprise tech buyers.

By working closely with the AWS team, we were able to overlay AWS data sources onto our ThousandEyes path visualization, enabling our customers to understand and more effectively communicate with AWS to quickly resolve issues within their network.\n\nOur own Operations team recently experienced the power of this capability in their own troubleshooting, when they discovered an underperforming Global Accelerator node while testing paths to the ThousandEyes service (see Figure 1). Combining ThousandEyes and AWS insights into a single view dramatically reduced their problem identification and resolution time.\n\nNow, we’re announcing a new integration with AWS that will extend our visibility even further.\n\nAmazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor was launched by AWS at re:Invent 2022 to help customers with key insights regarding “performance and availability over the Internet.” Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor provides Internet health events and Internet performance insights that are relevant for their customers’ workloads. It also provides customers suggestions for the placement of AWS workloads to reduce time-to-first-byte, which helps optimize overall end-to-end performance. Combining ThousandEyes’ end-to-end cloud and Internet visibility with AWS’s Internet health and performance insights will allow a complete view of an application’s entire service delivery path, across private environments, the public Internet, and into the AWS network.\n\nThe integration of Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor insights into the ThousandEyes platform will enable us to provide AWS customers with precise suggestions on where to place their workloads to achieve optimal (lowest) time-to-first-byte performance. It will also allow customers to simplify their ThousandEyes test setup by leveraging CWIM customer traffic profiling to suggest vantage points (based on geographic and/or network proximity) and test types to achieve the most accurate visibility into their customers’ digital experience.\n\nWith this latest AWS integration, ThousandEyes continues to lead the way in cloud and Internet visibility, enabling our customers to assure the delivery of digital services for every one of their users. As we move forward, we are remaining committed to delivering unmatched end-to-end visibility, AI-enabled insights, and streamlined workflows to enable our customers to achieve digital excellence.\n\nThe integration will be available to ThousandEyes and Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor customers in the spring of 2024. In the meantime, AWS customers using ThousandEyes will be able to take advantage of our unparalleled visual visibility into and within the AWS network.",

Insight was already a hard sell because of its lack of value, but then to say go buy your own licenses or upgrade all the way to Secure SD WAN +? You are practically selling competitor products for them at this price point.\n\n-\"Credits\" and a limited number of tests makes no sense in the first place when I am running these tests from my own hardware, if I license my hardware for a feature I should be able to use as much of it as the platform will permit.",

      "# [ThousandEyes BGP Monitors by ThousandEyes Engineering, medium.com on 2024-04-30](https://medium.com/thousandeyes-engineering/thousandeyes-bgp-monitors-fac4d272609c)\nby Lefteris Manassakis, Software Engineering Technical Leader at Cisco ThousandEyes\n\nAt Cisco ThousandEyes, we are currently deploying a real-time BGP monitoring infrastructure developed originally by Code BGP, a company Cisco acquired in August 2023. In this post, we discuss the motivations for developing our own BGP monitoring infrastructure, outline the challenges encountered during the process, and explain the solutions implemented to address those challenges.\n\nWhy develop our own BGP monitoring infrastructure?\n\nThe reasons can be classified into three main categories: Availability, Quality/Integrity, and Security/Visibility.\n\nAvailability: RIPE RIS and RouteViews are the leading public BGP monitoring infrastructure projects. Network operators and researchers around the world depend on these resources to gain insights into the inter-domain routing system. Both projects offer invaluable datasets from hundreds of BGP peers, providing a window into the Internet’s evolution over the past two decades.\n\nRelying exclusively on third-party sources for BGP data presents a risk, as these infrastructures may experience outages or periods of unavailability.\n\nQuality/Integrity: In this context, ‘data quality and integrity’ refers to the accurate maintenance of routing state. This means correctly reporting whether each of the nearly 1.2 million IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes — currently announced by more than 75,000 Autonomous Systems — is present (or not) in the routing tables of each of our BGP monitors.\n\nTo collect as much data as possible, public infrastructures have historically maintained an open peering policy. This allowed any network to peer with them and contribute BGP data. As a result of this policy, RIPE RIS has more than 1,500 peers, and RouteViews has over 1,000.\n\n‘Hobbynets’ — amateur networks connected to public sources due to their open peering policy — are more prone to reporting incorrect routing state due to misconfigurations. We reported on such an instance last year. These errors are particularly challenging to debug without access to the entire data pipeline.\n\nNotably, RIPE has acknowledged challenges associated with its RIS open peering policy and over the last few years has switched to a selective approach for new peers.\n\nSecurity/Visibility: Research has demonstrated that sophisticated hijackers can craft hijacks to avoid detection by public monitoring infrastructures. These attackers are capable of altering the routes they announce — employing well-known techniques such as AS-path prepending — to prevent their propagation to public route collectors. This issue extends beyond theoretical discussions and research. In fact, we detected such an event last year and reported on it in our blog. By maintaining our own monitoring infrastructure, we are able to cover “dark corners” of the Internet that are not visible to public sources, thus enabling the detection of such events of low visibility.\n\nThe ThousandEyes platform has utilized BGP datasets from both RIPE RIS and RouteViews for several years. To address the associated challenges, the team has developed an automated mechanism that tracks the health of public BGP monitors and Route Collectors. This mechanism employs a penalty algorithm that triggers corrective action when specific conditions are detected, such as missing updates. Once these conditions are identified, the automation intervenes by disabling the malfunctioning monitor, essentially by stopping it from providing data to the pipeline. We will continue maintaining and enhancing this logic for the ThousandEyes BGP monitors to ensure the quality and integrity of our data.\n\nDesired characteristics of our BGP Monitoring System\n\nThe desired characteristics of our BGP monitoring infrastructure are:\n\nAccess to BGP Data from Hundreds of Sources\n\nGeographical distribution of sources\n\nLarge number of upstream providers/upstream diversity\n\n2. Near real-time functionality\n\nAcceptable delay is within minutes\n\n3. Ability to identify the source of each update\n\nFor each BGP update, we should be able to identify the router we got it from\n\nEach of these requirements comes with its own set of challenges. In this post, we will discuss how we addressed these challenges and built the “ThousandEyes BGP Monitor” service.\n\nRequirement #1: Access to BGP Data from Hundreds of Sources\n\nOne of the primary challenges at Code BGP involved establishing peering relationships with networks to acquire BGP data. Identifying peering providers, deploying routers in locations such as colocation facilities, and engaging in peering negotiations proved to be logistically impractical. To overcome this, we turned to Virtual Machine (VM) providers who not only offer VMs but also BGP sessions with full tables. I humorously refer to this service as “The Democratization of Peering.” Currently, there are over 180 providers offering such services, making the selection process a significant challenge in itself.\n\nCriteria for Selecting BGP Providers:\n\nDual Stack: Support for both IPv4 and IPv6 is mandatory.\n\nFull BGP Tables: Providers must supply full BGP tables for both IPv4 and IPv6.\n\nGlobal Footprint: A wide selection of locations across various cities and countries is preferable.\n\nAutomation: The capability for users to subscribe, deploy VMs, and access services independently through a web interface is crucial, minimizing the need for manual intervention.\n\nUpstream Diversity: It is important to assess the range of upstream providers. We give priority to providers with a diverse set of upstream connections.\n\nRequirement #2: Near real-time functionality\n\nTo achieve our objective of near real-time functionality, we decided to utilize BGP directly. The reader might wonder how BGP can meet this requirement, given its inherent limitations, such as those imposed by the Minimum Route Advertisement Interval (MRAI).\n\nThe MRAI timer, as defined in the main BGP specification (RFC 4271), is designed to rate-limit the frequency of routing updates. This timer is applied to both route announcements and withdrawals on a per-session basis. In Cisco implementations (e.g. IOS or IOS-XR), the default eBGP MRAI timer is set to 30 seconds, which is in line with the recommendation in RFC 4271. However, this default setting can significantly affect network convergence times. Its impact is particularly noticeable during route withdrawals, where the phenomenon known as “path hunting” occurs. During path hunting, BGP tries all available alternative paths one by one before concluding that a route is non-existent, which can result in convergence times of several minutes. Therefore, in this context, the opposite of the saying “bad news travels fast” is true. In BGP, good news (announcements) travel faster than bad news (withdrawals).\n\nLast year, we presented at various network operator conferences (such as DKNOG, UKNOF and others), demonstrating that detecting hijacks not only in minutes but also in seconds is feasible. However, given the MRAI, people were asking us how this is even possible.\n\nWhen a new prefix is announced in BGP, it propagates instantly via the best AS path and becomes visible across the globe in seconds. The MRAI timer is triggered after the first update for this prefix is received. This fact explains how we were able to achieve such fast detection. In most cases, though, detection within minutes is the norm and what we should expect.\n\nRequirement #3: Ability to identify the source of each update\n\nThis requirement is critically important, as it allows us to answer questions such as, “Which monitors detected this hijack?” or “On which monitors is this prefix visible?”\n\nThe ThousandEyes platform currently operates across three regions: US1, EU1, and US2. Customers are distributed among these regions, each with its own unique BGP monitoring needs. To address this, we have decided to deploy sets of Route Collectors in each AWS region. These Route Collectors act as demarcation points for the monitors. The term “Route Collectors” essentially refers to routers that “speak” BGP and collect routes from the BGP monitors.\n\nIn an eBGP session, the router typically changes the ‘next hop’ attribute of a BGP route to its own address when forwarding a route, according to RFC 4271. By establishing eBGP sessions between our monitors and Route Collectors, the routes we collect include the IP addresses of the routers from which they propagate before reaching the collectors. Consequently, the Adj-RIB-in of the Route Collectors is transmitted to the rest of the pipeline using the BMP protocol (RFC 7854), which is considered the state-of-the-art in BGP monitoring. This process provides us with a continuous stream of BGP updates.\n\nLeveraging Open Source software\n\nCisco is actively engaged in supporting and sponsoring open source software, and we also utilize OSS throughout our data pipeline. As we already mentioned, our BGP monitors are Virtual Machines, and similarly, our Route Collectors are AWS EC2 instances running open source operating systems such as Ubuntu or Amazon Linux. Moreover, we employ GoBMP, an implementation of the BMP protocol’s collector in Go language, and publish the collected BGP data to kafka topics.\n\nFor the open-source routing software of choice for both our monitors and route collectors, we have chosen to deploy Bird 2 for several reasons:\n\nMinimal Memory Footprint and Resource Consumption: We aim to ensure each VM operates efficiently with limited resources. Despite being configured to use only 1 CPU and 1 GB of RAM, Bird is capable of maintaining the entire Default-Free Zone and propagating BGP updates to dozens of route collectors without strain.\n\nMature and Stable Implementation: Bird has a solid reputation for reliability, having been in use for over a decade. It is the preferred route server software for most Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) worldwide.\n\nBMP support: Since October 2023, Bird version 2.14 has included support for both pre- and post-policy BMP monitoring, along with the capability to handle multiple BMP protocol instances. This update has allowed us to leverage Bird as a route collector as well, since BMP is a core component of our architecture.\n\nWe have successfully deployed a large fleet of BGP monitors across the globe and we are currently connecting them in production.",

      "# [Cisco steps up full-stack observability play with Splunk tie-ins by Michael Cooney, Michael Cooney Senior Editor on 2024-06-07](https://www.networkworld.com/article/2139679/cisco-steps-up-full-stack-observability-play-with-splunk-tie-ins.html)\nAn indication of how impactful the Splunk buy could be for Cisco and its customers can be seen in the companies’ plans to integrate their observability platforms. At this week’s Cisco Live event, execs from Cisco and Splunk detailed plans to create what they called a “unified observability experience” to help customers manage applications across on-premises, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments.\n\nCisco closed the Splunk acquisition in May, spending $28 billion to gain the vendor’s wide-reaching technology for searching, monitoring and analyzing system data.\n\nSplunk describes its Observability Cloud as a full-stack, OpenTelemetry-native SaaS platform. Customers use the platform to monitor and troubleshoot their infrastructure, application performance, and end-user experiences. Using AI technology, the platform can spot anomalies and help customers identify the root cause of an error or performance problem, according to Splunk.\n\nCisco’s Full-Stack Observably Platform is designed to collect and correlate data from application, networking, infrastructure, security, and cloud domains to provide a clear view of what’s going on across the enterprise and make it easier for enterprises to spot anomalies, preempt and address performance problems, and improve threat mitigation.\n\nCisco’s platform includes performance-monitoring technology gained in two earlier acquisitions: Its ThousandEyes network intelligence solution analyzes Internet routing and cloud connectivity data, for example, while its AppDynamics software specializes in application performance monitoring. Further integrating all of that information with Splunk could significantly boost the expanded platform’s observability capabilities. (Going forward Cisco said its AppDynamics technology will be developed under the Splunk umbrella.)\n\nThe combination of Splunk, AppDynamics, and ThousandEyes will be a critical differentiator for Splunk and Cisco in the observability market, said Cisco president and former Splunk CEO Gary Steele at the Cisco Live event.\n\nSplunk brings depth and detail all the way down through the network to really understand what’s happening, added Tom Casey, senior vice president, products and technology, for Splunk. “And what I’m particularly excited about is our ability to bring and enrich our environment with all of that Cisco network data and thousands of data points, to give customers a fundamentally different perspective on what’s really up and running and why.”\n\nEffectively integrating the observability capabilities of the two vendors will ultimately determine the success or failure of the acquisition, experts said.\n\n“There is a ton of accessible enterprise data, analytics and telemetrics available to Cisco and Splunk, and what will be key for them is to integrate everything effectively – because customers don’t need a package full of different products that they need to figure out how to incorporate and use somehow,” said Neil Anderson, vice president of cloud, infrastructure and AI with technology services provider World Wide Technology.\n\nIntegration work has already begun. For example, one new development will let customers integrate logs from Splunk Platform with Cisco AppDynamics and Splunk Observability Cloud for faster troubleshooting across on-prem and hybrid environments, Casey stated.\n\n“This integration lets SaaS and on-prem customers centralize logs and analyze them in context. With this integration, ITOps and engineering teams will be able to view multiple telemetry types for their traditional environments in a single interface, to perform in-context troubleshooting for three-tier and microservices-based applications,” Casey stated.\n\nAnother new feature will integrate application performance and business transaction metrics as well as alerts from Cisco AppDynamics with Splunk IT Service Intelligence (ITSI) to reduce alert noise and correlate IT health with business KPIs. “By integrating Cisco AIOps with Splunk IT Service Intelligence, alerts and events from Cisco networking devices and infrastructure can be correlated alongside the broader IT estate, for more accurate in-context troubleshooting inclusive of network signals,” Casey stated."
