      "# [Cisco ThousandEyes Service Finder](https://servicefinder.thousandeyesresearch.com/)\nTechnical Discovery Questions\n\nâ¢What happens when the problem is beyond your network? â¢How effective are your existing monitoring tools for detecting an incident caused by a 3rd-party cloud provider or an ISP? â¢When is the last time you had an outage with your ISP? Cloud/SaaS provider? How long did it take them to respond? â¢How much time do you spend triaging issue between your infrastructure vs ISP vs SECaaS vs SaaS/Cloud?\n\nCommon Messaging\n\nSaaS monitoring solutions are fundamentally different from legacy APM, ITIM or NPMD tools. Organizations don't own SaaS apps. They merely rent them from providers. As a result, you don't have access to them, can't control them, and can't customize them. Simply put, that means you have limited visibility in our new reality and even less control.\n\nWith employees so reliant on these apps and IT struggling to troubleshoot issues remotely, you can see why so many user experiences might fall short. SaaS monitoring is laser focused on determining the point of origin of an issue and who is impacted. This contrasts strongly with a legacy toolâs broader focus on finding \"something to fix.\" This makes SaaS a \"black box\" as far as legacy monitoring is concerned.\n\nOffice 365\n\nMicrosoft Office 365 is a bouquet of applications aggregated under a common portal, with a common look and feel. However, they are all distinct applications that share some common elements but may be delivered very differently. You cannot poll Microsoftâs routers, get flow records from their data center, or install your own monitoring agents on Exchange Online servers.\n\nThousandEyes with the help of distributed agents helps by presenting IT with complete, end-to-end visibility for each different Microsoft application, whether it be Teams, Outlook, SharePoint, and so on. Now IT can visualize a user's journey through the network and get new insight into their o365 experience. And because IT can see every hop and every provider along the way, they can set a baseline for each component within the private networks, the Internet, and the cloud provider infrastructures. So, when an issue arises, it's easy to check performance against the various baselines.\n\nThousandEyes helps IT become proactive, as well. With a deeper understanding of how the network backbone performs and how users are entering the Microsoft edge, IT can deliver far superior user support with proactive alerting, reporting, and collaboration on performance issues.\n\nUse Case Study\n\nSnapshots:\n\nO365 Login Outage\n\nOneDrive Outage\n\nO365 Dashboard\n\nWebex\n\nCollaboration APPs like Webex, have become more and more challenging as the Meetings client selects the best datacenters dynamically each time a call is established â an ever moving target. Not only that, desktop apps are becoming more and more complex leveraging new technologies like Edge compute and CDNs making it harder to identify the right IP to monitor.\n\nThousandEyes End User Monitoring delivers both on-demand and real-time visibility into each Webex employeeâs experience, as well as underlying wireless LAN, WAN, Internet connectivity and system health. ThousandEyes has the ability to dynamically test towards Webex servers for each user without any manual intervention. This is an automated tailor made monitoring strategy for each Webex user.\n\nThis empowers your network and IT teams to quickly troubleshoot performance issues related to Wi-Fi, bandwidth capacity, ISP routing, VPN gateways, Webex availability and other sources.\n\nSnapshots:\n\nRTP Stream Test (Network degradation)\n\nAgent-to-Agent Network Test (Network degradation)\n\nAutomated-Session Test (Network degradation)\n\nZoom\n\nCollaboration APPs like Zoom, have become more and more challenging as the Meetings client selects the best datacenters dynamically each time a call is established â an ever moving target. Not only that, desktop apps are becoming more and more complex leveraging new technologies like Edge compute and CDNs making it harder to identify the right IP to monitor.\n\nThousandEyes End User Monitoring delivers both on-demand and real-time visibility into each Zoom employeeâs experience, as well as underlying wireless LAN, WAN, Internet connectivity and system health. ThousandEyes has the ability to dynamically test towards Zoom servers for each user without any manual intervention. This is an automated tailor made monitoring strategy for each Zoom user. This empowers your network and IT teams to quickly troubleshoot performance issues related to Wi-Fi, bandwidth capacity, ISP routing, VPN gateways, Webex availability and other sources.\n\nSalesforce & Lightning\n\nSalesforce adopters are faced with many challenges that require a high level of network and application performance tuning due to the unpredictability of the Internet and the extensive configurability of the Salesforce platform. Salesforce, unlike other SaaS applications, such as Microsoft 365, is not an âout-of-the-boxâ application. Itâs typically customized by developers to suit the needs of the enterprise, and it often leverages third-party applications for business functions such as Marketing, Sales and Customer Service. User location can also impact performance, as Salesforce hosts each enterpriseâs application environment from a specific data center.\n\nWith ThousandEyes Active Monitoring techniques and the correlation of application-layer data with network-layer data, ThousandEyes with the help of distributed agents helps by presenting IT with complete, end-to-end visibility. Now IT can visualize a user's journey through the network and get new insight into their Salesforce experience. And because IT can see every hop and every provider along the way, they can set a baseline for each component within the private networks, the Internet, and the cloud provider infrastructures. So, when an issue arises, it's easy to check performance against the various baselines. ThousandEyes helps IT become proactive, as well. With a deeper understanding of how the network backbone performs and how users are entering the Salesforce edge, IT can deliver far superior user support with proactive alerting, reporting, and collaboration on performance issues.\n\nUse Case Study\n\nTechnical Discovery Questions\n\nâ¢What happens when the problem is beyond your network? â¢How effective are your existing monitoring tools for detecting an incident caused by a 3rd-party cloud provider or an ISP? â¢When is the last time you had an outage with your ISP? Cloud/SaaS provider? How long did it take them to respond? â¢How much time do you spend triaging issue between your infrastructure vs ISP vs SECaaS vs SaaS/Cloud?\n\nAmazon\n\nTraditional monitoring software practices and techniques like SNMP, packet analysis, flow and logs (syslog etc.) work great for an on-premises data center, but tools like these flatline in a public-cloud environment like AWS where there is limited visibility and ability to instrument. AWS CloudWatch, for AWS cloud monitoring, can provide insights into VPC performance, but it lacks the perspective of end-user experience and doesnât cover the interconnectivity between AWS networks in different regions that host multi-tiered applications. AWS CloudWatch also doesnât provide visibility into Internet connectivity to external SaaS services. We call this a visibility blindspot.\n\nThousandEyes uses active monitoring techniques to collect critical performance metrics and visualize delivery paths from your users to the AWS data centers. You can use our AWS application monitoring to view availability, usage and response times correlated with intra-region, inter-region and inter-service network packet loss and latencies and identify performance bottlenecks within your cloud environment. Unlike other AWS monitoring tools, ThousandEyes uncovers hidden dependencies across AWS network services like EC2 and S3 to minimize operational risks. You can also monitor and validate availability of external API engines, perform AWS uptime monitoring, AWS server monitoring, and track other services delivered via the Internet that your AWS-hosted applications rely on.\n\nUse Case Study 1\n\nUse Case Study 2\n\nMicrosoft Azure\n\nMicrosoft Azure does not have to seem like a visibility \"black box.\" With ThousandEyes, you can monitor end-to-end latency and visualize application delivery paths between on-premises components and services migrated into Azure. Determine root cause of application delivery issues and eliminate finger-pointing between application and network teams that adds unnecessary time to troubleshooting. Correctly identify the responsible teams and collaborate in real time using ShareLinksâ¢, without a confusing crosstalk and siloed Azure monitoring tools.\n\nWith ThousandEyes Microsoft Azure monitoring, you have the ability and tools to measure and visualize application and network-layer performance delivery on a cloud-to-cloud, Internet-to-cloud and inter-region basis. With Azure monitoring, companies gain immediate and comprehensive visibility into every service delivery path in a multi-cloud environment, allowing them to overcome the complex operational challenges of cloud deployments, accelerate cloud adoption and deliver superior digital experiences.\n\nUse Case Study\n\nGoogle Cloud\n\nMigrating applications and building new services in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) clouds creates a host of new network and service dependencies, on which your app delivery and user experience rely.\n\nWith ThousandEyes Google Cloud Platform monitoring, you have the ability to measure and visualize application and network-layer performance on a cloud-to-cloud, Internet-to-cloud and inter-region basis. Companies gain immediate and comprehensive visibility into every service delivery path of the Google Cloud infrastructure, allowing them to overcome the complex operational challenges of cloud platform deployments, accelerate cloud adoption and deliver superior digital experiences to their users. Leverage our global network of Cloud Agents, pre-deployed in 201 cities, including 17 Google Cloud regions, for immediate insights into your cloud deployments. Or, deploy lightweight Enterprise Agents in your Google Cloud VPCs for insights into private network paths. Together, these vantage points give you deep visibility into end-to-end paths across your enterprise LAN, WAN, ISPs and your cloud interconnect options.\n\nUse Case Study\n\nAlibaba Cloud\n\nTraditional monitoring tools, such as SNMP and flow logs, that many enterprise IT teams rely on have significant blind spots when it comes to monitoring the public cloud. They simply cannot provide insight beyond the perimeter of your enterprise into cloud-based application delivery and inter-service communication in a multi-cloud and hybrid environment. This type of operational blindness in your Alibaba Cloud deployment can jeopardize your investments and put your business at risk of delivering poor digital experiences.\n\nIt's time to overcome the complex operational challenges of cloud platform deployments and deliver superior digital experiences. With ThousandEyes Alibaba Cloud monitoring, your enterprise can measure and visualize application and network-layer performance across every service delivery path: whether that's cloud-to-cloud, Internet-to-cloud and inter-region.\n\nGet immediate insight into your Alibaba Cloud deployments with our Cloud Agents, which are pre-deployed in 201 cities, including 19 Alibaba Cloud regions. Or deploy ThousandEyesâ lightweight Enterprise Agents as ECS instances within your VPCs to monitor regional service dependencies, troubleshoot hybrid architecture snags and visualize bidirectional network paths. Combine these vantage points for unprecedented visibility into end-to-end paths across your enterprise LAN, WAN, ISPs and your Alibaba Cloud services.\n\nUse Case Study\n\nTechnical Discovery Questions\n\nâ¢Who are the key 3rd party providers that impact your customersâ experience? â¢What happens when the problem is beyond your network? â¢How effective are your existing monitoring tools for detecting an incident caused by a CDN provider or an ISP provider that CDN depends on? â¢When is the last time you had an outage with your ISP? CDN provider? How long did it take them to respond? â¢How effective are your existing monitoring solutions in detecting the effectiveness of a DDoS mitigation?\n\nCommon Messaging\n\nYou pay your CDN to deliver great service to your users. If youâre in a large web or media firm, you may be spending millions of dollars annually on your CDN. So you probably care about your CDNâs performance. There are quite a few ways in which you can monitor your CDN. You will already have an APM or RUM solution in place like AppDynamics, NewRelic, Datadog or Dynatrace, which helps to understand overall performance, but can be sorely lacking when youâre trying to troubleshoot network issues. Why is there higher latency to a specific edge location? Why did the edge location change suddenly?\n\nThousandEyes uses active probing to monitor CDN performance, with broad global visibility and deep insight into specific network issues that cause performance to fluctuate. You can take several broad approaches to actively monitor your CDN:\n\n* User to Edge: Monitor the edge to see locations, network performance and cache utilization. Use Cloud Agents distributed in customer geographies to target a domain, page or specific object.\n\n* User to Origin: Monitor the origin to create a baseline of performance without your CDN, traversing the public Internet. Again, use Cloud Agents.\n\n* Origin to Edge: Monitor the connection between origin and edge to ensure proper routing and bandwidth for content updates and cache misses. Use Enterprise Agents to target the CDN edge; depending on your CDN configuration you may want to target specific, proximate edge locations or intermediate load balancers.\n\nUse Case Study 1\n\nUse Case Study 2\n\nUse Case Study 3",

Since COVID, and since we use split-tunneling client VPNs for people working from home, I have lost some visibility into the end user's experience when it comes to things like \"this website is slow\".\n\nAnyone using ThousandEyes or an alternative? I am also curious about how expensive ThousandEyes is.\n\nThanks for any help!\n\n## Comment ID i8tqg7f with +16 score by [(lol_umadbro, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uqvmps/anyone_using_thousandeyes_endpoint_agents/i8tqg7f/) (in reply to ID uqvmps):\nWe’re using it, primarily enterprise agents though. All of our licenses came from units bundled with Cat9k purchases, so I can’t speak to the pricing front. \n\nSince we have very limited licenses, we do not run any tests 24/7/365. We set up tests during break-fix troubleshooting, specific to the issues being reported. This lets us maximize our few licenses rather than running them constantly. \n\nThis may fit your use case based on what you described.\n\n## Comment ID i8tudmh with +14 score by [(port53, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uqvmps/anyone_using_thousandeyes_endpoint_agents/i8tudmh/) (in reply to ID uqvmps):\nTE is very expensive and the enterprise agents are... not very reliable.\n\nThere was recently an issue where the agents all tried to upgrade themselves (they're docker containers that think they're VMs) and the upgrade was failing, but that didn't stop them from endlessly downloading the upgrade bundle to the tune of several Gb/s across them all.\n\nWe just renewed but are on the path to replace TE with something less brutal on price.  Only reason we didn't this time is because we didn't have enough time to rewrite some integrations but they're on the road map now.\n\nThere has to be better/cheaper solutions for monitoring home users.\n\n### Comment ID i8urg9g with +10 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uqvmps/anyone_using_thousandeyes_endpoint_agents/i8urg9g/) (in reply to ID i8tudmh):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID i8vl0ha with +1 score by [(suddenlyreddit, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uqvmps/anyone_using_thousandeyes_endpoint_agents/i8vl0ha/) (in reply to ID i8urg9g):\n> Stay away from Zscaler and their solution\n\nWait, which solution, do you know?

It's best for monitoring links and internet health outside of your organization's control to aid troubleshooting so you're not on a P1 for an hour trying to understand the scope of a reported issue when the culprit is say a flapping link in the core of one of your ISPs.\n\nYou're really better off using your endpoint management to give you that kind of data.

Another tool for the tool belt. Whether it's a user's home connection or not, if its a work provided PC/laptop in which they reporting as having issues on, they're going to reach out to their workplace's support first almost 99% of the time. \n\n2. Split-tunnel + \"internet website is slow\" =/= not my problem. Cloud services need to be taken into consideration and to do so sanely, you need some insight from the perspective of the user's connection. This is also huge in cases where suddenly multiple or a subset of users are reporting similar issues and tools such as TE, you may be able to quickly identify this is an issue with a provider/region or even know about it before the report come in. Instantly slashing to time needed to investigate 10s or 100s of support cases.\n\n3. May be controversial but non-voluntary and required WFH change, at least for post-employment perspective, does impose at minimum a very high level support requirement of the business (some case required legal reimbursement). 99% of users know zero networking, purchase the cheapest plans and use the provided combo routers which serves their purposes. So when they move to WFH and suddenly have difficulty maintaining their level of work due to connectivity issues, the business should at least provide incredible basic tshooting or at least guidance whether on what to relay to their provider or a potential requirement to upgrade their service/equipment. I have witnessed remote users spend hundreds on routers (due to marketing non-sense) and stuck in contracts due to service plan upgrades because they were grasping at straws for a stable work experience and in the end being let go when it could have been solved with basic tshooting.\n\nBasically, if you're going to have to deal with the support request regardless, a tool that speeds up tshooting and reduces back and forth conversations has a value of its own. Time spent even reading a support case is time spent not working on other support cases. That time is a cost in and of itself.\n\n#### Comment ID i8uwm46 with +1 score by [(ChuckIT82, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uqvmps/anyone_using_thousandeyes_endpoint_agents/i8uwm46/) (in reply to ID i8uktkx):\nexact same 3 points why we're using it.\n\n### Comment ID i8u6xc0 with +6 score by [(certpals, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uqvmps/anyone_using_thousandeyes_endpoint_agents/i8u6xc0/) (in reply to ID i8u4kw2):\nThat's exactly what I thought.

But I work in a small enough org (approx 250 users), where if executive Bob has issues at home, it is still IT's problem. And even if it's receptionist Jane and she puts a ticket in while working from home, we still investigate instead of saying \"sorry, since you are at home we can't troubleshoot\".\n\nBut to be honest, my post doesn't necessarily come from only that type of scenario. Last week, we had users at a branch complain of performance issues with Salesforce. Well, at HQ we didn't have any issues with Salesforce, and the network didn't have any obvious red flags (I have a network monitor at our datacenter, and the traffic to that branch seemed fine, the throughput seemed fine, ping, tracert, etc all seemed fine). So there I am trying to figure out why this site was having performance issues to Salesforce, with no visibility as to why the issue was only impacting them. And at the time, I remember thinking to myself: \"doesn't something like ThousandEyes have the ability to say \"here is where the issue is between your user and Salesforce\"?\"\n\nTurns out the issue was a portion of the Salesforce page was trying to load from Germany, and Germany was blocked at that branch.\n\n#### Comment ID i8unrc1 with +1 score by [(Syde80, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uqvmps/anyone_using_thousandeyes_endpoint_agents/i8unrc1/) (in reply to ID i8udlma):\n> where if executive Bob has issues at home, it is still IT's problem.\n\nThis is something I really love from having moved from a smaller org to municipal government.

We can influence inbound or route around outbound issues, by depreferring or completely shutting down peering with our upstream SPs.

Share ThousandEyes data with NOCs that insist there is no problem in their network or with our peering points.  Of course useful only with our direct peers. This can shorten time to resolution for my team, or give us ammo to request SLA credits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn both cases, it is mostly useful when the problem is persistent, longer lasting or recurring often.

My company recently got Thousandeyes, but all my endpoint testing goes through the zscaler tunnel and we are not able to see the TCP overlay.

Use something blast out ping packets to each client in parallel (my script runs under windows and uses a win32 API to do this. If your scripting language doesn't have an asynch ping, you could always use fping. Do this a few times (5 maybe back to back) and record the min and max latency, and percent lost. Repeat every X minutes.\n\nYou'd undoubtedly need multiple servers to hit 3000 clients (probably use one server/script per gateway)\n\nYou could also grab the client's public IP and do a traceroute to it and record the resulting path. MTR has a handy output format that is meant to be parsed.\n\nStore the results in database of choice.

I don't manage it. That fact prevents me from creating code to use the API. It never ceases to piss me off that Palo won't do a read-only API option. Every time I bring it to my account rep, he says that modern programming environments have credential vaults, so it's not a problem. I've tried to explain that there's no credential vault that can survive a determined user with root access, but it falls on deaf ears.\n\nThe few programs that I do have that use the API are behind a web server and I use explicit authentication so that the script can grab the user's id and password. I then use the id/password version of the API auth to access.\n\nPalo REALY needs to pull their heads out of their collective ass and come up with a read-only option for the API.\n\nAlternately, they need to expose this stuff via SNMP. That's how I get the client IP addresses out of the wifi controller.\n\n## Comment ID gy3obt5 with +2 score by [(lross78550, Reddit, 2021-05-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/paloaltonetworks/comments/mz1fmv/global_protect_endpoint_connection_performance/gy3obt5/) (in reply to ID mz1fmv):\nHey Guys, Took 2 weeks but I got an answer from PA engineering about the pre and post tunnel latency info in the logs.. Here it is.\n\nThanks Lee\n\nPre-tunnel latency:\r  \n==============\r  \n\r  \n\\- Based on OpenSSL handshake\r  \n\\- This is the same handshake that is used to check gateway availability and calculate weight based on response time during gateway selection process\r  \n\\- Measuring the time from initial SYN (TCP 3-way handshake) until SSL Close Notify\r  \n\r  \nPost-tunnel latency:\r  \n===============\r  \n\r  \n\\- Measured after tunnel has been established\r  \n\\- Measuring RTT for a single tunnel keep-alive ICMP probe sent within the tunnel (same as tunnel keepalives)\r  \n\r  \nNOTE :\r  \n\r  \n1. Pre-tunnel latency is calculated during gateway selection/discovery process\r  \n2. Post-tunnel latency is almost always faster as it measures single keep-alive RTT and not the whole handshake (TCP and SSL)\r  \n3. We should NOT compare Pre-tunnel and Post-tunnel latency as they are not measured the same way.\n\n## Comment ID gvy2oyr with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-04-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/paloaltonetworks/comments/mz1fmv/global_protect_endpoint_connection_performance/gvy2oyr/) (in reply to ID mz1fmv):\ngreat questions. We haven't had a ton of issues but on a case-by-case basis we usually have them do a speedtest off vpn, and then do an internal speed test on our intranet to gauge the VPN throughput.  This obviously doesn't account for a lot of potential issues but atleast gives us a quick idea of what their connection is like.  Most issues are poor wi-fi from carrier provided modems. We did have some issues with some users that were in a split-tunnel config, when Comcast started using [10.0.0.0/x](https://10.0.0.0/x) as their default dhcp scope a while back as it coincided with one of our internal subnets.\n\nThis isn't something we are currently monitoring but this have given me a push to look into it. thanks!\n\n## Comment ID gw1cans with +1 score by [(zbiles, Reddit, 2021-04-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/paloaltonetworks/comments/mz1fmv/global_protect_endpoint_connection_performance/gw1cans/) (in reply to ID mz1fmv):\nThe product thousandeyes (just acquired by Cisco) has a small client app you can run on machines to gather performance data like traceroute, latency, jitter, RTT, etc. a little pricey but would likely give you what you’re looking for.",

Currently we use PRTG which works great for downtime, netflow and such. But i am looking for something with a bit more depth. Currently we are not able to scan switches and access points, due to those devices being on a non vpn management vlan, but maybe some tool would be able to father data from those devices using the meraki dashboard api?\n\n\n\nAlso i would really like to be able to test the connection between point A and point B. Something like the features of Cisco ThousandEyes. Without it being so gosh darn expensive.\n\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n## Comment ID jd776mk with +4 score by [(chiapeterson, Reddit, 2023-03-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/meraki/comments/11ydm1l/what_do_you_use_for_network_monitoring/jd776mk/) (in reply to ID 11ydm1l):\nDomotz\n\n### Comment ID jd7our1 with +2 score by [(VioletiOT, Reddit, 2023-03-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/meraki/comments/11ydm1l/what_do_you_use_for_network_monitoring/jd7our1/) (in reply to ID jd776mk):\nawesome!! :)\n\n## Comment ID jd7el87 with +7 score by [(MartinJSa, Reddit, 2023-03-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/meraki/comments/11ydm1l/what_do_you_use_for_network_monitoring/jd7el87/) (in reply to ID 11ydm1l):\nSorry this is a bit of a plug - but I'm product director for a company called Highlight that creates a network service assurance (inc monitoring) platform that's quite tightly integrated with Meraki's dashboard APIs - we're on the Meraki app marketplace [here](https://apps.meraki.io/en-US/apps/381711/highlight-service-assurance-platform/overview).

The work environment is unprofessional and at sometimes, downright hostile.  The on-boarding training was sub par.  Sales numbers are declining across.   In 7 months I was asked to take on multiple roles on the team.  I was even asked to develop a sales territory via cold outbound prospecting which had no Account Executives hired to take meetings. The next career step was Corporate Sales and their manager was in the office maybe two days a week.  The SDR team is incredibly negative and sometimes personally insulting.  The new SDR manager is trying to change this, but I fear the momentum is too much.",

There are a few items we wish to highlight: 1) Many of our sales hires in Austin are new because the decision to start a customer centric hub in Austin was made just over a year ago. 2) Employees go through performance reviews and feedback. These HR conversations are confidential. 3) We are proud of the work being done by the SDR team and have invested in employee development with many examples of promotions from the SDR team to the Corporate Sales team and onwards as well as a recent change in sales model so CSR teams get the ability to partner with more experienced field sales teams. 4) The company is continuing to experience healthy growth driven by customer revenues.\r\n\r\nWe understand ThousandEyes may not be a fit for everybody. We appreciate your feedback and will continue working on creating a positive experience for everyone.\r\n\r\nDoug Cunningham\r\nManager, Enterprise Sales Development",

Lunch is provided daily and there are plenty facilities for team-building, including pool, ping-pong and video-games.\r\n\r\nThe platform itself is incredibly stable, and a consistent 2-week release-cycle means that bugs are fixed and features are added on a regular basis, which makes customers extremely happy.  Customer satisfaction and engagement rates are off the charts, and the live-chat support model is setting the standard for response &amp; resolution times.\r\n\r\nBest of all, this is a small company that is growing, so you are always going to be exposed to other areas of the business and have the opportunity to get involved in projects that span multiple departments.

The work environment is unprofessional and at sometimes, downright hostile.  The on-boarding training was sub par.  Sales numbers are declining across.   In 7 months I was asked to take on multiple roles on the team.  I was even asked to develop a sales territory via cold outbound prospecting which had no Account Executives hired to take meetings. The next career step was Corporate Sales and their manager was in the office maybe two days a week.  The SDR team is incredibly negative and sometimes personally insulting.

      "# [ThousandEyes Documentation on 2024-11-08](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/whats-new/changelog)\n2024-11-08\n\nRemoved ISR1100X-4G from the Support Matrix\n\nISR1100X-4G has been removed from the list of supported Cisco devices for Enterprise Agents in the product documentation support matrix: Cisco Devices Support Matrix.\n\nThe ISR1100X-4G was added to the documentation in error in advance of final validation. It has since been discovered that it is not possible for us to support the Enterprise Agent on this device. At this time, it is not expected that this model will be brought into support.\n\nOpenTelemetry Trace Signal for Page Load and Web Transaction Tests\n\nAdded support for the OpenTelemetry trace signal for page load and web transaction tests. This enhancement provides deeper visibility into application performance.\n\n2024-11-01\n\nEndpoint Agent Client Version 1.219.1\n\nThe following enhancements have been made to the Endpoint Agent client:\n\nAll Platforms\n\nPreviously, the agent would not correctly respect HTTP tests that had requested IPv6-only results for name resolution. This issue has now been resolved.\n\nThe agent now attempts to call the new unregister API -endpoint when an account change occurs, allowing the system to free up the license, if applicable, improving the account change workflow.\n\nThe agent now registers itself from a file containing relevant information, thereby enhancing provisioning workflows in the future.\n\nWindows\n\nPreviously, there were instances where local user accounts linked to a specific agent were registered multiple times, resulting in duplicates appearing on the Agent Settings page. This issue has now been resolved. However, the existing duplicated user accounts are still visible on the Agent Settings page. We plan to address this in a future update.\n\nThe Chrome and Edge extensions are now compatible with the ThousandEyes agent running on the Windows arm64 operating system through x64 emulation.\n\nTesting of ingress and service for scheduled tests using Cisco Secure Access (CSA) ZTA is now supported.\n\nmacOS\n\nPreviously, there were instances where local user accounts linked to a specific agent were registered multiple times, resulting in duplicates appearing on the Agent Settings page. This issue has now been resolved. However, the existing duplicated user accounts are still visible on the Agent Settings page. We plan to address this in a future update.\n\nTesting of ingress and service for scheduled tests using Cisco Secure Access (CSA) ZTA is now supported.\n\narm64 native packages are now available on the ThousandEyes platform.\n\n2024-10-31\n\nEnhanced Network Outage Detection Algorithm\n\nWe’ve improved the accuracy of our network outage detection algorithm. These enhancements allow us to more precisely detect network outages and attribute them to their source Autonomous System Number (ASN).\n\n2024-10-29\n\nTemplates: BGP Prefixes Are Now Supported in Global Settings\n\nWhen using templates to set up tests that support BGP, you can now specify one or more prefixes, just as you can in basic test configuration. For more information about setting up BGP tests, see BGP Tests.\n\n2024-10-29 Bug Fixes\n\nFixed a height issue for template details.\n\nRemove properties with invalid null values in the preset templates.\n\n2024-10-24\n\nEnterprise Agent Appliance Backup/Restore and Automatic Upgrades\n\nWe have released two capabilities today for Enterprise Agent appliances (the ThousandEyes Virtual Appliance (TEVA) and ThousandEyes Physical Appliance (TEPA) for the NUC and Raspberry Pi 4). You can now perform a backup of the configuration and agent identity on your appliances to a file that can be downloaded and retained for later restoration. You can also now perform a restore during the initial setup process to bring over a complete configuration, including agent identity. This backup and restore process was added into the product to simplify recovery if you encounter any issues.\n\nAdditionally, we have added an updated version of our automatic upgrade process which will allow you to perform an in-place upgrade from the base OS of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (\"Focal\") to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (\"Jammy\"). As we complete the release of new versions of all of our install types we will provide further communication in the future notify customers to begin upgrades, however this feature makes upgrades available today for customers using the TEVA and TEPA.\n\nEndpoint Agent Views 2.0: The New Default View\n\nThe new Endpoint Agent Views 2.0 will become the default view for all users starting October 26, 2024. You can switch back to the old version, Endpoint Agent Views 1.0, using the toggle in the user interface.\n\nYou can provide feedback about the Endpoint Agent Views 2.0 through the new Submit Feedback button in the top right corner of the user interface.\n\nPlease note that Endpoint Agent Views 1.0 will no longer be available after January, 2025. From that point on, only Endpoint Agent Views 2.0 will be accessible.\n\n2024-10-24 Bug Fixes\n\nView-only users can now browse and view templates, but they cannot create, update, delete, or deploy templates.\n\nResolved an issue where alert rules with adaptive configurations were not being saved correctly, causing the rules to default to manual configuration.\n\n2024-10-18\n\n2024-10-18 Bug Fixes\n\nFixed an issue with text wrap in the template detail displayed in the side bar.\n\nTemplates now render the test name correctly when the template form is first displayed.\n\nFix an issue in template creation status page where buttons weren't visible without scrolling down.\n\nCorrected the placement of the error notification in template creation flow.\n\n2024-10-15\n\nUnified Test Creation is Enabled for All Accounts\n\nUnified Test Creation workflow is now enabled for all accounts, as announced earlier. You can still switch back to the original test creation experience by clicking on the “Switch to Classic Test Creation” button. After January 17th, the classic test creation workflow will be deprecated and we will remove the option to switch back to it. To learn more about this improved workflow, see Templates: Start Monitoring.\n\n2024-10-14\n\nAnnouncing Test Optimizations\n\nTest optimizations are helpful recommendations to improve your existing tests. For this release, we’re analyzing your existing tests and will notify you if we notice an error in your proxy test settings. This common error occurs when tests are configured with an HTTP Proxy in place without using the \"Perform network measurements to the proxy\" setting. Many customers enable proxy settings on a per-agent basis and often forget to check this option to monitor the network to the proxy. As a result, data for the test will not be gathered for the network layer, leaving an unexpected gap in coverage.\n\nIf you have tests in this state, you will be notified and asked via callouts in the UI for permission to fix this error. Once you grant permission, we will automatically select the “Perform network measurements to the proxy” checkbox for the provided list of identified problematic tests. This solves the issue for the blank network layer in test views. Please note that this change will increase the network traffic to your proxy.\n\nFor more information on why you should select \"Perform network measurements to the proxy\" see Proxy Metrics. For more information about the proxy settings test optimization, see Test Configuration Optimizations.\n\n2024-10-10\n\nAnnouncing Azure Path Enrichment\n\nWe’ve expanded our cloud visibility by adding Azure Path Enrichment, building on existing AWS and GCP capabilities. Azure nodes with public IPs are now tagged and include region details in the path visualization, enhancing multi-cloud network insights. Service identification is planned for future updates. For more information, see Using the Path Visualization View: Supported Cloud Providers.\n\nNew Self-Service Internet Insights Trial for Existing Users\n\nExisting users can now request a free, 30-day trial of Internet Insights directly within the ThousandEyes portal. To begin, navigate to Internet Insights from the left-hand menu. In the limited outage map view, click Request Trial from the available call-to-action to activate your free trial.\n\n2024-10-09\n\nViews 1.0 Removed from ThousandEyes Platform\n\nAs of today, Views 1.0 is no longer available on the ThousandEyes platform. Users will now be directed to the new Views 2.0 experience for all test types, including voice (RTP and SIP), DNSSEC, DNS trace, and FTP tests, which are fully supported.\n\nThis change marks the final phase of our transition to Views 2.0, bringing improved performance, better visualization, and a more streamlined user interface.\n\nBrowserBot v3.0.0 Agent Architecture\n\nBrowserBot v3.0.0 on the Enterprise Agent has migrated to a new agent architecture that offers more control over the agent containers that run each instance of a page load, transaction or API test. The upgrade should be transparent to users and will have minimal impact to existing page load, transaction or API tests.\n\nIPv6 Network Tests over ICMP for Endpoint Agents\n\nThousandEyes now supports IPv6 network tests over ICMP for Endpoint Agents. Any existing ICMP tests will use \"IPv4 only\" by default and can switch to \"Prefer IPv6\" or \"Force IPv6\".\n\n2024-10-09 Bug Fixes\n\nFixed an issue where users couldn't run an instant test if they didn't close the welcome banner.\n\nResolved an issue in the dashboard filter where the Endpoint Agent test name filter was not applying correctly.\n\n2024-10-08\n\nWAN Insights Alerting\n\nThousandEyes now supports alerting for WAN Insights metrics such as capacity and site quality. To learn more, refer to the documentation pages at WAN Insights and ThousandEyes Alerts.\n\n2024-10-08 Bug Fixes\n\nImproved the error message users receive when trying to create a template with no tests in it.\n\nThe Endpoint template review step now says “…monitor your application” instead of “…deploy your application”.\n\n2024-10-07\n\nImpact of Win11 24H2 on Endpoint Agent's Wi-Fi Reporting\n\nWith the recent Windows 11 version 24H2 release, if Start > Settings > Privacy > Location is set to Off, the Endpoint Agent will no longer be able to report SSID, BSSID, or wireless signal quality information for the currently associated Wi-Fi access point. This change stems from updated security privacy requirements in Windows, which require users to enable location services.\n\nThis change has the following impacts:\n\nIn the path trace visualization, the wireless node is not displayed.\n\nDetails of BSSID, SSID, and signal quality are no longer available.\n\nNo data is displayed under Agent Views > Wireless.\n\nInformation about neighboring access points is not accessible.\n\nIn the segment visualization, connection status is displayed as unknown.\n\nTo ensure you get the best experience with our product, we recommend that your administrators enable location services by default for your organization's endpoints.\n\n2024-10-04\n\nSamKnows Data Migration Announcement\n\nAs we continue to integrate SamKnows into Cisco ThousandEyes, over the coming months we will deliver a number of data and customer migration activities. These activities will not interrupt any services the platforms provide, but you may start to see some small changes, and some of these changes may require you to take action. We detail these below.\n\nData and customer migration will occur in two phases.\n\nPhase 1 - Migration of Database and Infrastructure\n\nBy December 2024, we aim to migrate all SamKnows databases and infrastructure from Google GCP to Amazon AWS (Frankfurt). These migrations will be staggered, with a small percentage of traffic being moved at each step.\n\nThere will be no changes to how you access SamKnows One (https://samknows.one) in this phase. However, you may need to take action on the following points:\n\nThe IP addresses of our API endpoints will change.\n\nAs part of the move to AWS, SamKnows API endpoints will move to new IP addresses provided by AWS. We are not changing the hostnames of our API endpoints, so if you only rely on the hostnames then these changes will be completely transparent to you.\n\nWhile we advise customers to avoid hard-coding IP addresses, we are aware that some customers may have done so in order to satisfy their own security requirements (e.g., configuring an outbound IP ACL). If IP addresses have been hard-coded, then once we switch IP addresses, you may have issues accessing SamKnows APIs.\n\nIf you are unsure whether your SamKnows IP addresses have been hard-coded, we recommend checking with your network and security teams in advance.\n\nThe first IP address change will occur on 4 November 2024; the remainder will follow over the coming weeks and conclude by mid December 2024. You will receive regular reminders and updates from your Customer Success representative to ensure you are informed of and prepared for the migrations.\n\nIf IP hard-coding is unavoidable for your organization, find below a table of the current and new IP addresses.\n\nSome automated emails will start to be sent from the thousandeyes.com domain\n\nSamKnows One sends some automated emails to customers. For example, large data exports may be generated asynchronously and you will receive a link via email. Currently, these emails all originate from a samknows.com email address. Starting 4 November 2024, these emails will begin to originate from a thousandeyes.com email address.\n\nIf your email system has any allowlist for samknows.com, then you should also add thousandeyes.com to this allowlist by 4 November to ensure you continue to receive these automated emails.\n\nThousandEyes will start to be referenced inside samknows.one\n\nSome of the API documentation and endpoints will migrate from the API reference on samknows.one to the API reference on Cisco Devnet, where ThousandEyes APIs are referenced. There is no technical change here; the existing endpoints will continue to function as before.\n\nPhase 2 - Migration of Customers from samknows.one to app.thousandeyes.com\n\nBeginning in January 2025, once Phase 1 has completed, we will hard-switch SamKnows One over to the ThousandEyes platform. At this point:\n\nYou will be redirected to https://app.thousandeyes.com if you visit SamKnows One. When logging into https://app.thousandeyes.com for the first time, you will be prompted to reset your password.\n\nYou will find the SamKnows product suite under the Connected Devices menu item within the ThousandEyes platform.\n\nWe will continue to update the changelog and communicate with you via email during this transition to remind you of the changes, and inform you of specific dates by when certain actions need to be taken to avoid losing access to your SamKnows resources.\n\n2024-10-03\n\nTemplates Can Now Be Grouped\n\nTest templates can now be grouped using the Templates API. This offers an additional layer of organization allowing you to view sub-sections within templates, and turn off individual tests as well as intra-template groups, all in the sidebar. For more details, see the Templates API Reference.\n\n2024-10-03 Bug Fixes\n\nFixed an issue where non-square icons rendered strangely for collections.\n\n2024-10-02\n\nIntroducing Adaptive Alert Detection\n\nWe are pleased to announce adaptive alert detection, a powerful enhancement to our alerting system that is now available to all customers. Adaptive alert detection better distinguishes genuine issues from potential alert noise for faster incident resolution. This makes it easier for users to maintain optimal network performance with minimal effort.\n\nKey Features and Enhancements:\n\nIntelligent alerting: adaptive alert detection leverages a sophisticated algorithm (patent pending) to deliver more accurate, context-aware alerts that adjust dynamically to real-time network conditions.\n\nMinimal configuration: default settings provide value right out of the box with automatic aggregation, minimizing the need for setup or fine-tuning.\n\nReduced false positives: smarter detection reduces multiple alerts for the same issue (flappy alerts), reducing false positives, and ensuring alerts are more meaningful.\n\nCustomizable sensitivity: teams can adjust alert sensitivity (high, medium, low) to receive more or fewer alerts to suit their specific environment needs.\n\nAdaptive alert detection is currently available for Cloud and Enterprise Agent alerts. It is the default alerting method for all new alerts for these agents. You can edit new and old alerts alike to use the manual or adaptive method.\n\nSee Adaptive Alert Detection for more information.\n\n2024-10-01\n\nFinal Reminder to Transition to Views 2.0\n\nViews 1.0 will now be removed from the ThousandEyes platform after October 8th, 2024. We encourage all users to finalize their transition to Views 2.0 as soon as possible in preparation for this change.\n\nWe appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this transition. Please reach out if you experience any issues or have concerns regarding this change. Our goal is to ensure a smooth and seamless experience for all users.\n\n2024-09-26\n\nIntroducing Endpoint Agent Views 2.0\n\nWe are pleased to announce Endpoint Agent Views 2.0, an upgrade designed to streamline troubleshooting and enhance the user experience. From help desk technicians to network engineers, this new view allows everyone to access comprehensive information related to a specific agent, enabling efficient resolution of end-user issues.\n\nKey Features and Enhancements:\n\nSegmented Visualization: Quickly identify where the problem lies by segmenting the end-to-end path based on its owner, helping technicians to quickly locate, escalate and resolve problems.\n\nSegment Scores: Provides a simplified view of network health, allowing users to assess the impact of issues at a glance.\n\nPer-Process Information: Offers detailed insights into CPU and memory usage by specific applications and processes, enabling targeted action to resolve performance issues.\n\nThis new version is available for all users in a limited preview and is labeled as Endpoint Agent Views 2.0. The existing version is labeled as Endpoint Agent Views 1.0, and users can toggle between the two versions.\n\nSee Endpoint Agent Views 2.0 for more information.\n\nPAC files are cached for a limited time, and reloaded on a five minute interval.\n\nIf the PAC file is updated with invalid content, the Enterprise Agent may fail (even if it was previously working). In this case, the agent will continue to fail until the PAC file error is corrected and the agent reloads the valid file.\n\nSAML-JIT Provisioning for ThousandEyes\n\nWe are pleased to announce the release of SAML just-in-time (JIT) provisioning for ThousandEyes. This feature allows for on-the-spot user creation and authentication using SAML, streamlining user management and ensuring up-to-date records. For detailed setup instructions and more information, please refer to the SAML JIT provisioning documentation.\n\nEnterprise Agent Public IP Address TTL Set to 30 Minutes\n\nAs previously announced, we have changed how ThousandEyes Enterprise Agents update their associated public IP addresses to avoid IP flapping. Agents now only update the public IP address of the agent when the prefix length differs, or after a platform-configured time-to-live (TTL) value elapses.\n\nThe TTL value is now set to 30 minutes.\n\n2024-09-25\n\nCloud Insights Limited Preview\n\nCloud Insights offers new capabilities for monitoring and troubleshooting cloud native and hybrid cloud environments. These new capabilities include:\n\nExtending test path visualization with display of the discovered cloud network topology.\n\nTracking cloud network configuration changes correlated with performance and availability measurements.\n\nVisualizing cloud traffic flow information over time. Cloud Insights currently supports AWS hosted applications and is available for evaluation until December 2024. For more details, please see Cloud Insights.\n\n2024-09-18\n\nAlpine Linux 3.20 Images Now Available\n\nWe have now released updated Docker for Linux container images that are based on Alpine 3.20. Moving forward, all container-based installation types for the ThousandEyes Enterprise Agent will be built against an Alpine base instead of an Ubuntu base. This conveys numerous advantages for customers, primarily due to the reduced size of the base image, which improves the performance of installation and upgrades, reduces the security footprint, and enables us to improve velocity for our engineering teams.\n\nThis has no impact on existing installs. New installations with the updated images will have the new base.\n\nConfigure Splunk HEC Exporter in ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry\n\nYou can now configure the following fields in the Splunk HEC exporter stream: token, source, sourceType, and index. For more details, visit the Splunk integration guide.\n\nWith the new capability to configure the Splunk HEC index, you can choose whether to export ThousandEyes telemetry data as events or metrics to Splunk. Learn more here.\n\nAdditionally, setting the Splunk HEC token in customerHeaders[\"token\"] is now deprecated. The token should be specified in exporterConfig.SplunkHec.token going forward. This functionality will be removed in 3 months.\n\n2024-09-18 Bug Fixes\n\nAn issue that was incorrectly showing interface metrics data in the Endpoint Agent view has been resolved. In particular, due to a misalignment in the data, sometimes we were showing data even when the agent was offline. The problem has been addressed, and now the data is properly shown.\n\nAn issue that was incorrectly associating Endpoint Agents with Endpoint labels when the submission of the agent data was delayed (e.g., agent loses connectivity to the Internet) has been resolved.\n\n2024-09-05\n\nAdd \"optional\" Field to the UserInput Model in Templates\n\nA new boolean field named “optional” has been added to the UserInput model to mark a given user input as optional. You can now create or edit a template with optional user inputs.\n\nSupport for Monitoring OpenAI\n\nTests in a template can now target the OpenAI API (api.openai.com). If the consumer of a template has an OpenAI API key, they can provide that as a user input, which can be used in the template for the API tests. However, the field is optional and is not required for deploying the template.\n\nEndpoint Agent Client Version 1.206.0\n\nThe following enhancements have been made to the Endpoint Agent client:\n\nAll Platforms\n\nPreviously, the agent only considered ICMP-based protocols for testing the AnyConnect underlay when the VPN used IPSEC-based connections. The agent will now consider TCP tests for such cases.\n\nThe compatibility of the Endpoint Agent Internet Explorer plug-in is improved when used with other third-party Internet Explorer plug-ins that use a different version of the Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime.\n\nThe agent has been updated to continue supporting the integration of Webex Control Hub with the latest Webex client release.\n\nAn issue has been resolved where the agent did not correctly consider the Zscaler PAC file and did not correctly identify bypassed targets.\n\nPreviously, when the agent conducted Webex calling dynamic tests, it could potentially use a different interface than the originally detected network flow. This has now been corrected, and the agent will consistently use the same interface for testing.\n\nImproved error reporting has been implemented for scheduled tests that target an HTTPS server via a proxy. If the proxy returns an HTTP error code, it is now reported as an \"HTTP\" error instead of a \"Receive\" error. Additionally, the HTTP error code reported by the proxy, along with the request and response headers, are now accessible for inspection.\n\n2024-09-05 Bug Fixes\n\nFixed an issue where the step indicator caused an unexpected scroll behavior by pushing the navigation buttons.\n\n2024-09-04\n\nAs previously announced in the August 1st, 2024 changelog, we have updated the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols and cipher suites for all ThousandEyes services.\n\nThe following changes are now in effect for all ThousandEyes services:\n\nAdded support for TLS 1.3 protocols, enabling more secure and efficient cryptographic handshakes.\n\nAll Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) ciphers from the TLS 1.2 suite will be removed due to their susceptibility to specific vulnerabilities.\n\nUpdated supported Cipher Suites:\n\nTLS 1.2: ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256, ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, and ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305.\n\nTLS 1.3: TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, and TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256.\n\nThis update ensures compliance with the latest security standards and best practices, reducing the risk of exposure to known vulnerabilities associated with CBC ciphers. Clients and integrations must support the aforementioned cipher suites to maintain compatibility with our application.\n\nEnterprise Agent Public IP Address Behavior Change\n\nPreviously, ThousandEyes Enterprise Agents have updated their associated public IP address on every check-in. However, this can cause the agent's IP to flap in some situations, so we have made a change to only update the public IP address of the agent when the prefix length differs or after a platform-configured time-to-live (TTL) value elapses.\n\nSendGrid Email-to-SMS Disabled\n\nDue to recent SendGrid policy changes, SendGrid no longer supports relaying messages to email-to-SMS addresses (for example, 1234567890@tmomail.net). This change affects customers who use this method for alert notifications.\n\nTo ensure uninterrupted alert delivery, we recommend you explore alternative notification channels while we work on finding new options to support SMS notifications.\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry Introduces Data Model v2\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry now supports data model v2. As part of this update, ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry now uses data model v2 as the default version. Both data model v1 and data model v2 remain available for use. For more details, refer to the ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry Data Model documentation.\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry Data Model Now Streams the test.name Attribute for Endpoint Tests\n\nThe test.name metric attribute is now included in OpenTelemetry streams for all ThousandEyes tests, including Endpoint Agent tests. Previously, this attribute was only available for Cloud and Enterprise Agent tests. For more information, see ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry Metrics.\n\n2024-09-03\n\nThousandEyes Physical and Virtual Appliances Now Run on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS\n\nThe base operating system for our ThousandEyes Physical Appliance (TEPA) images for Intel / ASUS NUCs and Raspberry Pi 4s, as well as our ThousandEyes Virtual Appliance (TEVA) images for VMware ESXi, VirtualBox, and Hyper-V, has been switched to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.\n\nWith this change, we've also updated the appliance customization in the Add Agents dialog to produce images with an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS base.\n\nThis has no impact on existing installations. All new installations with the updated images will have the new base operating system.\n\n2024-08-28\n\nMulti-Factor Authentication for User API Tokens\n\nSecurity is at the core of ThousandEyes values, and with the latest updates, we are introducing a significant enhancement to the security of user API tokens. Now, whenever a user needs to create, remove, or regenerate basic tokens or OAuth bearer tokens, they will need to enter the multi-factor authentication (MFA) code sent to their user email.\n\nFor more details, see User API Token.\n\nJava SDK v1.0.0\n\nThe Java API SDK v1.0.0 has been published and is now available to all customers. You can access these resources through the Maven Central portal. You can also access and contribute to our public GitHub repo.\n\nTo install a package from the SDK:\n\nFixed Values for BSSID and SSID in the UI for macOS 14.6\n\nAs reported earlier, we have implemented an interim solution to substitute the all-zero BSSID string and Unicode characters replacing SSID in reports by a fixed value in the format - Unknown SSID - Agent name/ Unknown BSSID -Agent name\n\n2024-08-28 Bug Fixes\n\nAn issue was found where classic webhook integrations were missing from the Notifications tab on the Endpoint Alert Rules page. This has been resolved.\n\n2024-08-21\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry Data Model Now Streams the test.name Attribute\n\nFor Cloud and Enterprise Agent tests, the test name is now included as the metric attribute test.name, exported using ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry. For more information, see ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry Metrics.\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry BGP Metrics Are Now Event-Driven\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry BGP metrics are now event-driven, which means that they will only be streamed when there is an update in the monitored prefixes. For more information, see ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry.\n\n2024-08-15\n\nRecommendations and Templates Now Appear Together on One Page\n\nPreviously when you selected Start Monitoring, recommendations and templates were shown separately. Now they are shown side by side for more convenience and improved usability.\n\nIntroducing the Unified Test Creation Workflow\n\nTo streamline the test-creation experience, we are continuing our rollout of the unified test creation workflow that began on June 20th. From the Test Settings screen, you can click Start Monitoring to begin your monitoring journey. This allows you to create a single test; or deploy from the test recommendations or built-in or user-defined templates.\n\nTo switch back to the original test creation UI, click Switch to Classic test creation. You can also create single test from the + button. For more information, see Templates: Select a Template via Start Monitoring.\n\nIntroducing ThousandEyes Connected Devices\n\nWe are excited to announce the general availability of our new Connected Devices suite of products and functionality. Known previously to many as SamKnows, this internet performance monitoring platform has taken up residence in ThousandEyes and is rebranded as Connected Devices.\n\nFitting squarely within ThousandEyes’ agent and test infrastructure, Connected Devices measures the crucial \"last mile\" of internet performance via new Device Agents and a host of new tests. The Device Agents live on routers and within mobile apps to enable network visibility down to the personal device level. The new range of tests allows measurements to be taken across all ThousandEyes test layers. In addition, the agents can simulate tests to real applications such as games, social media sites, and video conferencing services, for accurate quality-of-experience measurements against tools and services that end users really care about.\n\nConnected Devices also brings us Cisco Real Speed, a two-step speed test triggered from both the router and the personal device in real time that can help users and their broadband providers alike determine whether the cause of an issue is rooted inside the home or without – a serious new ally in addressing the age-old question of “is the problem inside or outside my home?”\n\nNote that test results are viewed from a new user interface on the ThousandEyes platform specially built for Connected Devices customers – they are not currently viewable on ThousandEyes Views screens.\n\nRead more about the many capabilities of Connected Devices, and how to view and analyze your test results, at Connected Devices.\n\nEach Device Agent requires a license. Some tests also require the purchase of units. Speak to your account manager about purchase options, and learn more about the pricing model at Device Agent Consumption Model.\n\nMap View Adjustment for Browser Tests\n\nThe map component in Views 2.0 has been rearranged so that Unique Agent Stats or the Agent Identifier is at the bottom of the map section. Duplicate and extraneous information in the Map section of page load and transaction tests has been removed.\n\nImpact of macOS 14.6 on Endpoint Agent's Wi-Fi Reporting\n\nWith the recent macOS 14.6 point release, the Cisco ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent can no longer report SSID or BSSID information for the currently associated Wi-Fi access point. This change stems from updated security privacy requirements in macOS, which require user consent to enable Location Services and opt-in to share location data with each application.\n\nThis change impacts:\n\nUser Interface:\n\nThe SSID and BSSID values are now displayed as an all-zero BSSID string and Unicode characters replacing SSID in reports.\n\nSSID is no longer populated in tables.\n\nThe Wireless Info section no longer displays SSID/BSSID details.\n\nThe Connection segment no longer shows SSID/BSSID information.\n\nAgents without SSID information will be grouped within Path Visualization.\n\nAgent Labels: Labels based on SSID/BSSID are no longer functional.\n\nData Tagging: Datapoints are not tagged correctly, affecting filtering.\n\nTest Assignments: Test assignments that rely on these labels are non-functional.\n\nWi-Fi Monitoring: Monitoring for Wi-Fi change events (e.g., channel swaps) may also be disrupted.\n\nWe're working on an interim solution to address the UI issues by the end of August, 2024, and will let you know about any further updates.\n\n2024-08-14\n\nProxy Settings Available for API Test Type\n\nProxy Metrics are now available for the API test type. Proxy settings were previously available for HTTP server, page load, and transaction tests.\n\nConfigure these settings in Cloud & Enterprise Agents > Test Settings under the Advanced Settings tab. When Perform network measurements to the proxy is checked, the Agent to Server layer in the API test type view shows proxy details, which appear as another node, as well as network layer metrics such as proxy loss, latency, and jitter.\n\nEndpoint Agent Client Version 1.203.4\n\nThe following enhancements have been made to the Endpoint Agent client:\n\nRoomOS\n\nThe agent has been updated to ensure ongoing support for the integration of Webex Control Hub with the latest release of the Webex client.\n\n2024-08-08\n\nEndpoint Agent Client Version 1.203.2\n\nThe following enhancements have been made to the Endpoint Agent client:\n\nAll Platforms\n\nFixed an issue where the agent ran dynamic tests for Webex Calling on a different interface than the originally detected network flow.\n\nFixed an issue with the network probes that prevented the agents from reporting system metrics such as CPU/Memory, Signal Quality, and Link Speed.\n\nPreviously, when auto-detect found that no modes were suitable for testing the target, it would return an incorrect probe mode. This has now been fixed to report the original mode if no testing is performed.\n\nThe agents' path tracing is improved when using a VPN.\n\nThe robustness of auto protocol detection is enhanced to counter frequently occurring network changes.\n\nThe agent will enforce a maximum database size for both, the system and the user agent.\n\nWindows\n\nThe unapproved NPCAP versions can be used by default to run te-diagnostics network tests.\n\nThe agent updates will continue to work even if the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is disabled.\n\nPreviously, when a user selected version 1.00 of NPCAP as an allowed NPCAP version, the agent would not support it. This has now been resolved, and the agent supports version 1.00 of NPCAP.\n\nRoomOS\n\nFixed an issue where an unresponsive DNS server could lead to increased memory usage.\n\n2024-08-07\n\nUpcoming Transition to Views 2.0\n\nWe are excited to announce that Voice (RTP and SIP), DNSSEC, DNS trace, and FTP tests are now fully supported for Views 2.0. With these final test types supported, we will be making changes to how users interact with test views on our platform:\n\nAt the end of August, 2024, the option to set Views 1.0 as the default preference will be removed. All tests will be presented in Views 2.0 by default.\n\nUsers will still have the ability to manually click \"Open Views 1.0\" to view a test until October 1st, 2024. However, this change will only apply to the selected test during the active browser session.\n\nOn October 1st, 2024, Views 1.0 will be removed from the ThousandEyes platform. After this date, the \"Open Views 1.0\" option will not be available, and all tests will exclusively use Views 2.0.\n\nWe appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this transition. Please reach out if you experience any issues or have concerns regarding this change. Our goal is to ensure a smooth and seamless experience for all users.\n\n2024-08-05\n\nEnd of Support for Skype for Business\n\nWe are deprecating support for Skype for Business, as the upstream service has now been deprecated by Microsoft. The functionality will be removed from all voice tests within ThousandEyes on November 5th, 2024.\n\n2024-08-01\n\nIn our ongoing efforts to maintain the highest security standards, we are updating the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols and cipher suites for all ThousandEyes services.\n\nAfter September 2nd, 2024, the following changes will be in effect for all ThousandEyes services:\n\nAdded support for TLS 1.3 protocols, enabling more secure and efficient cryptographic handshakes.\n\nAll Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) ciphers from the TLS 1.2 suite will be deprecated due to their susceptibility to specific vulnerabilities.\n\nUpdated supported Cipher Suites:\n\nTLS 1.2: ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256, ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, and ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305.\n\nTLS 1.3: TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, and TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256.\n\nThis update ensures compliance with the latest security standards and best practices, reducing the risk of exposure to known vulnerabilities associated with CBC ciphers. Clients and integrations must support the aforementioned cipher suites to maintain compatibility with our application.\n\nWe encourage all users to verify their systems' compatibility and make any necessary adjustments to continue enjoying secure communications with our application.\n\nTo improve the explainability of the widget for executives and team members, you can now save a description for any dashboard widget in ThousandEyes.

You can also access and contribute to our public GitHub repo. Installing a package from the SDK is as simple as running pip install thousandeyes-sdk-usage.\n\nNew Cloud Agents\n\nNew Cloud Agents have been added in the locations listed below. For a full list of Cloud Agents, see ThousandEyes Cloud Agent Locations.\n\nBarcelona, Spain (Vodafone)\n\nBarcelona, Spain (Vodafone) (IPv6)\n\nBelo Horizonte, Brazil (Vivo)\n\nBelo Horizonte, Brazil (Vivo) (IPv6)\n\nBerlin, Germany (Vodafone)\n\nBerlin, Germany (Vodafone) (IPv6)\n\nFrankfurt, Germany (Deutsche Telecom)\n\nFrankfurt, Germany (Deutsche Telecom) (IPv6)\n\nSantiago, Chile (Movistar)\n\nSantiago, Chile (Movistar) (IPv6)\n\nNew Azure Data Center Cloud Agents\n\nQuerétaro, Mexico (Mexico Central)\n\n2024-08-01 Bug Fixes\n\nAn issue that was not correctly applying the highlighting filtering in the Network Topology section of the Endpoint Views page has been resolved. The filtering is now correctly applied in the path view, and the nodes are properly highlighted when matching the condition.\n\nAn issue that was not correctly propagating the version 1.00 of the NPCAP library has been fixed. The Advanced Agent Settings tab for Endpoint Agent settings now includes the ability to define the allowed NPCAP versions for Endpoint Agents.\n\n2024-07-22\n\nDashboard Templates for Endpoint Agent\n\nYou can now deploy dashboards using designated templates to monitor the end-user experience, diagnose overall network and application health, and streamline troubleshooting. You can learn more about deploying them in Dashboard Templates.\n\nThis release introduces the following Endpoint Agent dashboard templates:\n\nHome Worker Dashboard\n\nEnd User Helpdesk Dashboard\n\nEnd User Wireless Health Dashboard\n\nEnd User Localized Issues Dashboard\n\nEnd User Health Overview Dashboard\n\nEnd User Office vs Remote Dashboard\n\nEnd User Detailed Wireless Health Dashboard\n\n2024-07-16\n\nTo enhance system performance and streamline management, we have set a limit of 1,000 elements (an element is defined as each option you can add to a filter used to describe the label) for each Endpoint Agent label. This limit can comfortably accommodate the typical use of the Endpoint Agent labels. It will be enforced for all new and modified labels in the future, while pre-existing labels that surpass this threshold will remain unaffected. You can continue to employ and adjust these labels, albeit without the ability to expand the number of elements beyond the current value.\n\n2024-07-08\n\nNear Real-Time BGP Monitoring and Alerting\n\nOur BGP tests and alerting is being upgraded to near real-time, shifting from 15-minute intervals to 1-minute intervals after July 9, 2024, enabling quicker detection and response to BGP issues. Existing alert rules will automatically convert to the new format, with customized configurations now available based on time rather than round-based alerting. Users are advised to review and adjust their alert settings post-transition for optimal monitoring, with the v6 and v7 API endpoints being updated to include a new time field. Correction: Customers will be updated in batches through the end of the month.\n\nPrevious Announcement\n\nCreating and Editing Alert Rules\n\n2024-06-27\n\nNew Makeover for ThousandEyes\n\nAs announced previously, we have updated the ThousandEyes look and feel across our platform to better align with Cisco standards. This change includes redesigning our headers, left-hand navigation, icons, font, and typography, without affecting functionality. These changes will provide our customers with a consistent experience when they switch among Cisco Cloud products, and an improved modern user interface. Learn more about the UI changes from this video tutorial.\n\nEndpoint Agent Client Version 1.200.0\n\nThe following enhancements have been made to the Endpoint Agent client:\n\nAll Platforms\n\nIn certain cases, an issue prevented the Endpoint Agent from collecting local network and device metrics, such as Gateway, DNS, System CPU, and System Memory. The Endpoint Agent now identifies these cases and attempts to work around the issue.\n\nThe memory required for the Endpoint Agent installed on the Linux platform to run the network test has been reduced.\n\nAdditional information is included while reporting the cause of network probe failures to provide more clarity.\n\nPreviously, the agent used to crash when reading certain values from the database. This issue has been fixed.\n\nPreviously, the agent could see a false negative of 100% loss when running HTTP tests, the root cause was that an incorrect port was being discovered. This has now been corrected.\n\nThe diagnostics tool now supports extended UDP STUN testing to targets, aiding in diagnosing issues with the agent.\n\nFixed an issue that caused Real User Tests not to report all pages when a large number of monitored domains were visited simultaneously from a browser with the Endpoint extension installed.\n\nWindows\n\nFixed an issue that prevented the uninstallation of the agent after deployment using an MSI transformation file to apply the account information.\n\nmacOS\n\nThe macOS UI installation process has been enhanced to allow users to add the connection string and other account information post successful agent installation.\n\nPreviously, the agent was capturing and redirecting the stdout and stderr to files, which could under certain conditions grow unbounded. The agent no longer redirects stdout and stderr.\n\n2024-06-25\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry API Now Supports Data Streaming to Splunk\n\nWe've added support for streaming data from ThousandEyes to Splunk Cloud Platform and Splunk Enterprise using the ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry API. For more information, see Configuring ThousandEyes for Splunk Cloud or Enterprise Using the API.\n\n2024-06-21\n\nNew Makeover for ThousandEyes\n\nOn June 27th 2024, we will update the look and feel of our entire platform to better align with Cisco standards. This change includes redesigning our headers and left-hand navigation as well as updating our icons, fonts, and typography, all while avoiding any change in functionality. The changes will provide our customers with a consistent experience when switching between Cisco Cloud products and an improved modern user interface.\n\nAPI V6 End of Life Notification\n\nThis is a reminder about the end-of-life of API v6. API v6 will no longer be supported as of May 27th, 2025.\n\nOur v7 API introduces new capabilities for developers and DevOps-focused customers, ranging from standardization to performance and improved documentation. It aims to deliver a single cohesive API surface for all ThousandEyes product areas. The goal of our v7 API is to simplify and improve use cases while increasing interoperability with tools common to operations workflows.\n\nAccording to our API support policy, prior versions of our API are supported for one year, following an initial 90-day notification period.\n\nImproved Network Path Topology in Internet Insights\n\nIn Internet Insights' network topology screen, we have improved the differentiation between a node experiencing an outage and a node affected by the outage. This enhancement is intended to make it easier to understand where the source of an outage is coming from and where that outage is having impact on other network nodes. To learn more about this enhancement, see Network Outages Topology Tab.\n\nImproved UI for Endpoint Alert Rule Configuration\n\nUsers will see a new UI for the Alert Rules > Endpoint Agents page. This UI will make alert rule configuration more intuitive, with better performance and load times.\n\nIn Views 2.0, the page load tests summary now presents the following metrics, consistent with Views 1.0:\n\nDOM Load Time\n\nPage Load Time\n\nLoss and Latency Shown by Default in Views 2.0 for Network Outages and Network Events\n\nEarlier, when investigating network-based events, the redirection of the affected tests only selected loss as the metric of focus. However, network events can also be due to sudden spikes in latency. Therefore, now both loss and latency are selected by default when you view the affected tests from an event.\n\nPage load and transaction tests now support loading web pages that use WebGL. For web pages that trigger a browser-native notification, transaction tests now bypass these notifications.\n\nImprovements to Dashboard Filters\n\nImprove the Enabled/Included Dashboard Views We have enhanced the selection helper sidebar for the Tests dashboard filter. We have improved how to view only the tests that were selected in widgets and how to view only enabled tests.\n\nAdd Remaining Filter Values to Dashboard Filters Dashboard filters have expanded and are available for any variable that is applicable to a widget on an existing dashboard. If the combination of dashboard filters applied for a given data source is not intersectional, the widget notifies the user to adjust the filters.\n\nWidget Filters When a Widget Is \"Locked\"\n\nThe behavior of locked widget filters has been streamlined. When filters are locked for a given widget, only the widget filters are used, and the widget ignores any dashboard-level filters.\n\nContext Tooltips for Events\n\nIn order to better understand each event type, we have now added tooltips explaining each event type in the event detail.\n\nIncrease Available Stream Integrations per Account Group\n\nThe maximum amount of Stream Integrations per account group has been increased from 1 to 5, allowing you to create more streams to suit your needs.\n\nEndpoint Agent: Generic Installers to Replace Custom Installers\n\nAs announced previously, the customized links for the Endpoint Agent installers will no longer be available. Instead, generic installers will be used. The ThousandEyes UI section for creating customized installers is marked as Deprecated and will no longer be available after June 20, 2024. You can continue to use the old installers indefinitely. However, we recommend that you shift to the new generic installers.\n\nDocument Network Path Topology Enhancement for Internet Insights\n\nInternet Insights has improved the differentiation in the network topology screen between a node experiencing an outage and a node ‘affected by’ the outage. This enhancement is intended to make it easier to understand where the source of an outage is coming from and where that outage is having impact on other network nodes. To learn more about this enhancement, see Network Outages Topology Tab.\n\nServiceNow Incident Management Integration Support for Newest Versions\n\nWe have updated the ServiceNow Incident Management integration with ThousandEyes to support the latest versions, including the Utah, Vancouver, and Washington DC builds. Our documentation has also been updated to reflect the steps required for these latest versions.\n\nUbuntu 22.04 Support\n\nThousandEyes now supports installing Enterprise Agents on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (code name \"Jammy Jellyfish\", or just \"Jammy\"). For support dates, see the Enterprise Agent Support Lifecycle.\n\nBug Fixes\n\nResolved timestamp inconsistencies for PDF exports of dashboards.\n\nFixed an issue where the dashboard selector list was not surfaced in the expected order of most recent to oldest.\n\nFixed a bug that was showing inconsistent availability metrics for the scheduled tests in the Agent View. In particular, the availability was showing the opposite value (i.e., 0% when it was 100%).\n\nThe list of agents assigned to an Endpoint Agent test was not correctly sorted when more than 10 agents were assigned. The Edit Test side panel from the Endpoint Test Settings section now correctly sorts the agents assigned to a test.\n\nFixed a cosmetic bug that was incorrectly showing the agents running a test. When clicking a specific test in the Test Settings tab from the Endpoint Agents section, the user is able to see the amount of agents assigned to that test and the agents that are actually running that test. The Agents running the tests value was incorrectly computed and has been corrected.\n\nFixed a bug that was not showing the labels assigned to each agent in the Endpoint Agent Settings section with some screen size/resolution ratios. The user should now always be able to see the labels independently of the conditions of the screen.\n\nFixed a bug that was reporting \"No items available!\" when using special characters in the search of SSID and BSSID filters in the Endpoint Agent. User should now be able to search for those SSID and BSSID that include special characters.\n\nTo keep consistency with the rest of ThousandEyes UI, when clicking on a link that redirects the user to another area within ThousandEyes (e.g., \"Open in Views\" or \"Open in Agent Views\" when selecting a specific agent), the new area will be opened on the same browser tab instead of opening a new one.\n\nNew Cloud Agents\n\nBeijing, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nBeijing, China (China Telecom) (IPv6)\n\nBeijing, China (China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nChangsha, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nChengdu, China (IPv6)\n\nChengdu, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nChongqing, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nDalian, China (China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nFoshan, China (IPv6)\n\nGuangzhou, China (IPv6)\n\nGuangzhou, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nGuangzhou, China (China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nJinan, China (China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nNanjing, China (IPv6)\n\nNingbo, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nShanghai, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nShanghai, China (China Telecom) (IPv6)\n\nShanghai, China China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nShenyang, China (China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nShenzhen, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nShenzhen, China (China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nShijiazhuang, China (China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nTianjin, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nWenzhou, China (China Telecom) (IPv6)\n\nWuhan, China (China Telecom) (IPv6)\n\nWuxi, China (IPv6)\n\nXi'an, China (China Telecom) (IPv6)\n\nZhengzhou, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nFrankfurt, Germany (Vodafone)\n\nFrankfurt, Germany (Vodafone) (IPv6)\n\nPorto Alegre, Brazil\n\nLima, Peru\n\nSantiago, Chile\n\n2024-06-20\n\nIntroducing Unified Test Creation Workflow\n\nTo streamline the test creation experience, we will gradually introduce the new Unified Test Creation workflow starting June 20th. From the test settings, you can click on the Start Monitoring button to begin your monitoring journey. This allows you to create a single test or deploy from the built-in or user-defined templates.\n\nWe are also introducing suggestion cards to surface any available recommendations and integrations. These cards offer actions you can take to enhance your existing monitoring. Click the Set up Recommneded Tests card to find any discovered test recommendations and start deployment.\n\nTo switch back to the original test creation UI, click the “Switch to Classic test creation” button. For more information, see Templates: Select a Template via Start Monitoring.\n\n2024-06-18\n\nNew Bell Notifications and Improvements\n\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to improve user experience, we have added several new features to the \"bell\" notifications. These include:\n\nIndividual notifications can now be dismissed via the x button beside them in the notifications list.\n\nAll notifications can now be dismissed by clicking the new Dismiss All button.\n\nSome notifications are now contextual to the relevant account group, and will only appear in the notifications list when logged in to that account.\n\nThree new notification types have also been added:\n\nIntegrations available (only shows up if you don't have any integrations configured).\n\nRecommended Tests available (if you have an integration configured).\n\nYou have tests in a draft state.\n\nThese notifications will only be visible to users with the required permissions for setting up/configuring integrations and tests. In addition, they will only appear once every two of months, and will disappear after 7 days (unless dismissed before then). For tests in a draft state, notifications appear every 7 days as long as there are tests matching this state.\n\nFor more information about the bell notification, see Glossary: Bell Notification.\n\n2024-06-14\n\nIntroducing Near Real-time BGP Monitoring and Alerting\n\nThousandEyes will release near real-time BGP monitoring and alerting. BGP tests will have the ability to be run at a 1-minute interval (as compared to the current 15-minute interval). This means that Views for BGP tests will also show BGP test results in 1-minute windows. For alerting, the current 15-minute, round-based alerting will shift to the new time-based format capable of alerting at 1-minute intervals. We'll start rolling this out in batches in early July.\n\nTo enhance the tagging system at ThousandEyes, we will migrate all existing labels to tags in the backend. Unlike single-valued labels siloed by product area, tags are dynamic with key-value pairs that can be associated with multiple assets across products under a shared tag.\n\nStarting June 24, 2024, when you query for tags using the v7 API (e.g., /v7/tags), all labels will be listed in a tags format key:value. For example, an existing label with the value webex will be displayed as webex:webex, with the value duplicated as the key.\n\nLabels that were migrated to tags will include a field in the API response called legacyID, indicating that this tag was originally a label and was then migrated. legacyId corresponds to the numeric ID assigned to the original label. Tags that were created natively will have an empty value in the legacyID field in the API response. Tags are currently supported for CEA Tests, CEA Agents, Endpoint Scheduled Tests, and Dashboards. Tags are not applicable to Endpoint Agents.\n\nPlease note that this change is only visible via the API. The UI will continue to display labels as they are, and tags created using the API will not yet be visible in the UI. This will be updated when we introduce tags in the UI in a future release.\n\n2024-06-13\n\nIntroducing Enhanced Onboarding\n\nEnhanced Onboarding allows new ThousandEyes customers to onboard quickly and easily with personalized monitoring coverage recommendations based on email domains and best practice guides. In addition, you can select, configure, and deploy a wide range of certified templates. The process concludes with setting up notifications and integrations. Enhanced Onboarding guides new customers through every step, providing a seamless and tailored onboarding experience. To learn more about Templates, see Templates\n\n2024-06-11\n\nCreate Templates in UI\n\nYou can now create, edit and delete templates directly in the UI. You can modify the JSON contents of templates using a template editor in the UI, which includes syntax highlighting and intellisense to make editing and creating templates easier and less error prone than using the API. If you don't want to create a template from scratch, you can duplicate existing ThousandEyes templates and edit them. The template editor also supports editing and deleting templates. Note that editing or deleting built-in ThousandEyes templates is not supported.",
      "# [Test Type Layers and Units on 2024-08-15](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/user-management/usage-and-billing/test-layers-units)\nUnits for Cloud and Enterprise Agent tests are calculated based on various factors including their test type. Units for Device Agent tests are not calculated based on the same factors. This article explains how the test type variable applies to Cloud and Enterprise Agents unit calculation. For information about Device Agent unit calculation, see Device Agent Consumption Model.\n\nWhile the overal equation for calculating units is the same across all Cloud and Enterprise Agent tests (see Base Equation), different test types themselves have different unit rates, and their type and configuration is what alters the results of the equation, as described in Milli-Unit Cost by Test and Agent Type. Regardless of who the customer is, the unit rate for the test type itself doesn’t change.\n\nUsage accrues per configured test, and per agent. Rate is based on agent type (either Cloud or Enterprise Agent), test type, test interval, and test timeout setting. For example, running a test on a single Cloud Agent is cheaper than running the same test on 10 Cloud Agents; running a test on an Enterprise Agent costs less than running it on a Cloud Agent; and running a test on a 5-minute interval is cheaper than running the same test every 2 minutes.\n\nFor an example calculation, see Example Calculation.\n\nTest Type Layering\n\nThousandEyes test types include a “nesting” feature, as shown below. This diagram shows tests that are available from ThousandEyes Cloud and Enterprise Agents.\n\nThousandEyes test functionality is similar to that of the OSI stack, in that higher layers include lower ones. For example, the Network agent-to-server test also includes the BGP monitoring associated with the test target’s prefix. An HTTP server test includes both the Network agent-to-server test and BGP monitoring.\n\nDue to their nature, the DNSSEC and DNS trace tests do not implicitly contain lower level tests.\n\nNested Unit Consumption\n\nHigher layer tests consume the same number of units regardless of how many tests nest beneath them. That is, an HTTP server test, which includes agent-to-server and BGP tests, will only accrue the cost of the HTTP server test to your account (see the Example Calculation for an example of how an HTTP server test is calculated in units). Conversely, disabling nested tests under a higher level test does not save on units. So, for the same HTTP server test, if you turned off the agent-to-server nested test, it would still accrue the same number of units to your account. In essence, nested tests are free, so they neither cost more, nor save more.\n\nHow Do I Know How Many Units I Need?\n\nDesigning an optimal ThousandEyes test suite is a custom process. There is no one-size-fits-all solution – a lot depends on your critical business initiatives, and how your company is organized. As a new customer, your ThousandEyes account team will guide you in defining your use cases and in establishing proof of value (POV).\n\nHere are the rough steps that you can expect during the scoping process:\n\nOutcomes. First, determine your desired business outcome. For example “I want my e-commerce site to be available in all regions, with priority given to Central and South America because that’s where 80% of my customers are today.”\n\nTargets. Identify what assets you rely on for the desired business outcome. Assets are ThousandEyes test targets. For example, your e-commerce site would be one asset, and it might also rely on third-party cloud services, payment portals, or SaaS platforms.\n\nTest types. Determine which ThousandEyes test types are relevant to monitoring each target.\n\nVantage points. Consider the type of vantage points needed, for example whether you need Cloud Agents, Enterprise Agents, or both. Remember, usage-based consumption is only part of the picture; you might want to also make use of ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent licences and/or Internet Insights packages as well.\n\nIntervals. Identify an appropriate test frequency for each test. The test interval depends partly on your sensitivity to failure, i.e., how quickly you want to be alerted if something happens. For example, a social media streaming platform might want to know within two minutes if there’s a problem (before the news media starts reporting it) whereas for your company email portal, a five-minute interval might be enough. For very high-criticality test targets, you can use a one-minute testing interval with packet spreading as described on Packet Spreading for One-Minute Interval Tests.\n\nTimeouts. For some tests, the timeout setting determines whether the test is deemed “successful” or not. You can also set alerts based on timeouts. Some agent locations or test targets may need a more generous timeout setting than others. When doing transaction scripts a longer timeout may be needed to complete the user journey.\n\nOptimizing Your Test Intervals\n\nIdeally, test intervals should be one, two, or five minutes except in special cases.\n\nDon’t increase the time between tests just to save money. There are other ways to maximize value that won’t reduce your ability to quickly detect outages that matter to you.\n\nBalancing test coverage against value optimization involves a series of trade-offs. If you reduce the test frequency, you’ll lose visibility and the ability to be proactive. For example, if you get an alert about an outage, but it only triggers an hour after the outage has started, a lot of users might be filing tickets and complaining – so, what have you saved?\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nThousandEyes has developed a number of prescriptive recommendations and templates to facilitate common use cases such as Cisco Webex and Microsoft Office 365. Your ThousandEyes account team will guide you through these steps and help you achieve the maximum value from your tests and licensing agreements.\n\nCustomers seeking to exercise units from DNA subscription entitlements must request assistance in order to work with an account team.",
      "# [ThousandEyes Launches AI Tool To Predict and Fix Internet Outages by savio on 2024-06-06](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/news/thousandeyes-unveils-ai-tool-to-predict-and-fix-internet-outages/)\nThousandEyes, Cisco’s internet monitoring unit, has unveiled its new AI-powered tool, Digital Experience Assurance (DXA), designed to automatically predict and fix internet outages.\n\nThe company, which likens itself to the “Google Maps” of the internet, is enhancing its platform to offer proactive network quality and resilience measures for its customers.\n\nCisco’s ThousandEyes has launched Digital Experience Assurance (DXA), a set of AI-powered capabilities. This latest technology will monitor and predict network quality issues and fix them automatically to enhance the robustness of digital experiences. According to ThousandEyes, DXA allows customers to take preemptive measures on network problems, thus going beyond the traditional monitoring approach\n\nAccording to Joe Vaccaro, vice president and general manager of ThousandEyes, this technology allows businesses to solve certain issues before they affect users and even predict possible infrastructure problems. It utilizes massive datasets for forward-looking intelligence so that corporations can proactively deal with potential concerns before they cause significant degradation in digital experiences. Vaccaro stated that DXA went beyond metrics or simple measurements toward a closed-loop system that would optimize and remediate network performance with minimal manual intervention.\n\nThe company was founded 15 years ago and has invested heavily in AI technology in recent years. The DXA platform builds on ThousandEyes’ Event Detection technology, which reduces the time to detect disruption events to mere minutes, requiring fewer staff members. The new AI-driven features of DXA include capabilities for correlation, analysis, diagnosis, prediction, optimization, and remediation.\n\nRead More: Microsoft To Invest $3.2 Billion in Swedish Cloud and AI Infrastructure\n\nIn addition to the DXA launch, Vaccaro teased a forthcoming product that will leverage large language models similar to those used by generative AI systems like ChatGPT and Google Gemini. This new product is expected to enable users to generate AI-created scripts showing the status of global ISP networks, public cloud services, edge service networks, and application connections. ThousandEyes aims to provide even greater visibility and efficiency in managing internet and network infrastructures by automating these processes.\n\nMORE TECH NEWS",

It is imperative for IT organizations to deliver consistently positive digital experiences to both employees and customers. The challenge is these digital experiences are determined by an increasingly complex technology infrastructure where networks, data centers, cloud services, security mechanisms, endpoints, and an ever-growing set of data and applications must all work in concert. Factor in the accelerating use of external systems and services within the infrastructure and further complications arise in measuring, managing, and, ultimately, delivering an overarching positive digital experience to all. The industry needs simpler,\" said Mark Leary, Director, Network Observability and Automation, IDC. \"The industry needs smarter. Comprehensive data collection and cross-domain data correlation, driven by applied intelligence and embedded automation, stands to have a dramatic impact on IT engineering and operations as well as business execution and outcomes.”\n\n\"Experiencing our modern, timeless, and artisan-crafted home furnishings is incredibly important. So when we moved from in-person showrooms to virtual environments, one of our biggest challenges was to make sure customers could have the same great in-person experience, but remotely,” said Mark Rodrigue, Senior Network Engineer, Room & Board. “Being able to see and manage the Internet environments we now leverage to connect with our customers has been a game changer for our ability to assure performance. Before using ThousandEyes, it could take us days to understand where an issue was occurring, but now, we’ve seen a 96% improvement in our response time—and that’s been a game-changer for both fixing issues and working with the cloud and Internet service providers that we rely on.”\n\nAdded Resources\n\nBlog: Entering the New Era of Digital Experience Assurance Across Every Network\n\nBlog: It’s Time to Take Control of Experiences and Transform Infrastructure Operations for AI\n\nPress Release: Cisco Reveals Nexus HyperFabric AI Clusters, A New Simplified Data Center Infrastructure Solution with NVIDIA for Generative AI\n\nAbout Cisco\n\nCisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide technology leader that securely connects everything to make anything possible.

      "# [Cisco-owned ThousandEyes launches AI to predict and fix internet outages, teases ChatGPT-style tech by Ryan Browne, www.facebook.com on 2024-06-04](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/04/thousandeyes-launches-ai-to-fix-internet-outages-teases-genai-tool.html)\nSurasak Suwanmake | Moment | Getty Images\n\nCisco's ThousandEyes internet monitoring unit on Tuesday unveiled new artificial intelligence-powered capabilities it said will allow for much faster prediction and diagnosis of internet outages and disruptions.\n\nThe company said its new AI tech, called Digital Experience Assurance, or DXA, would enable customers of Cisco's networking technology to introduce the ability to automatically act on issues in their network quality.\n\nThis is opposed to what is currently the case with ThousandEyes' software, where customers mostly only monitor their IT infrastructure for network issues.\n\n'Google Maps of the internet'\n\nCisco ThousandEyes terms itself the \"Google Maps\" of the internet. That's because it has a broad, end-to-end view of every user and any application over any network.\n\nFounded 15 years ago, the company says it's been investing lots into AI in the past several years.\n\nBut now, ThousandEyes is making big, AI-focused changes to its platform aimed at giving its client base even more visibility over network quality and resilience.\n\nJoe Vaccaro, vice president and general manager of ThousandEyes, said DXA would provide the ability \"not only to resolve issues before they begin to impact my users, but leverage broad data to actually begin to predict and give forward intelligence on what might happen across infrastructure, to proactively address it before it begins to significantly degrade overall digital experiences.\"\n\n\"Digital experience assurance helps to build upon this evolutionary journey beyond metrics, beyond monitoring, towards a platform that delivers on a closed loop system,\" Vaccaro told CNBC in an exclusive interview.\n\nAmong the other capabilities, DXA comes with are the ability for businesses to correlate, analyze, diagnose, predict, optimize, and remediate with little or no manual intervention.\n\nCisco ThousandEyes says its platform is powered by over 650 billion daily measurements collected from around the globe. The firm committed to giving businesses visibility into their internal environments, including on-premises networks and cloud environments.\n\nThe product builds on Cisco ThousandEyes' Event Detection tech, which the company says already reduces the time taken to detect a disruption event to mere minutes and less staffing, rather than hours and multiple engineers.\n\nAI-generated internet status reports\n\nVaccaro also teased the development of a new product at Cisco ThousandEyes that, once complete, would enable users to generate AI-create scripts showing the status of global ISP (internet service provider), public cloud, and edge service networks, or an application's connection a network.\n\nThis is similar to what ThousandEyes currently offers for internet monitoring, but with AI automatically doing the work rather than people.\n\n\"That is in development and should be seeing the light of day here in the very, very near future,\" Vaccaro told CNBC.\n\nThe product would incorporate large language models, which are considered the bedrock of generative AI systems like ChatGPT and Google Gemini.\n\nRacking up 100 million users to date, ChatGPT was catapulted into global virality just months after its creator OpenAI released it. The app's success stoked massive hype around artificial intelligence, with companies of all stripes making developments of their own in the space.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct the day of the announcement.",
      "# [New Innovations to Deliver Enhanced Visibility to AWS-powered Application Experiences by Joe Vaccaro, Ananda Rajagopal on 2023-11-28](https://blogs.cisco.com/cloud/new-innovations-to-deliver-enhanced-visibility-to-aws-powered-application-experiences)\nToday at AWS re:Invent, we’re excited to announce new innovations from the Cisco Network Assurance and Cisco Full-Stack Observability teams that empower our customers with end-to-end visibility into digital experience delivery and business outcomes for applications leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS). The announcements include:\n\nA new integration between ThousandEyes and Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor (CWIM)\n\nBy leveraging insights from CWIM within the ThousandEyes platform, customers will gain custom recommendations on optimal placement of AWS instances and monitoring coverage based on user traffic profiles. ThousandEyes’ end-to-end cloud and Internet visibility combined with AWS’s Internet health and performance insights will allow a complete view of an application’s entire service delivery path, across private environments, the public Internet and into AWS’s network.\n\nAWS service expansion and new business metrics with APM correlation in Cisco Cloud Observability\n\nThis provides enhanced business context for AWS-hosted applications. New business metrics for a business transaction enrich and expand the business transaction monitoring capabilities of Cisco Cloud Observability to enable our customers to connect digital experiences to business outcomes and make faster decisions and prioritizations for applications running on AWS. We are also expanding the number of AWS services supported in Cisco Cloud Observability for deeper infrastructure monitoring.\n\nApplications are the front door to every modern organization, and when application experience suffers, so does brand reputation and, ultimately, revenue. The first step for businesses to ensure flawless digital experiences is simplifying their complex cloud native environments and applications. Then, the challenge becomes the ability to tie performance to business objectives.\n\nDelivering flawless digital experiences\n\nWith today’s news, we are further delivering on our promise to provide comprehensive visibility and enhanced business context into every domain that impacts digital experience. Whether it’s deep within the application itself or anywhere along the digital supply chain that delivers that application experience to users across home, enterprise, Internet, or cloud environments. Cisco customers are now equipped with the visibility, insights, and actionability they need to deliver exceptional digital experiences, keeping their customers happy and employees productive.\n\nOur customers leverage the power of AWS in different ways. Many host an application they own or elements of it on AWS or use third-party applications that sit beyond their ownership but have AWS services built in. With the advancements we’re making with AWS and within our product portfolios, we’re able to bolster visibility and business-metric insights in each of these use cases. With modern application monitoring (delivered via Cisco Cloud Observability) and end-to-end network assurance (delivered via Cisco ThousandEyes), Cisco offers comprehensive visibility and insights into all aspects of digital experience.\n\nModern Application Monitoring (Cisco Cloud Observability) delivers deep visibility of cloud native architectures with business context to help technology teams align application performance with end-user expectations and deliver business outcomes.\n\nEnd-to-End Network Assurance (Cisco ThousandEyes) is grounded in understanding and assuring the delivery of any application (whether you own it or not) over any network (whether you own it or not), ensuring customers have a true end-to-end view of the entire service delivery chain of every single application their business relies on.\n\nWe know that many of our customers rely on both AWS services and hybrid architectures to securely deliver business-critical services and optimal application experiences to their employees and end-users. From users, the expectation is that these experiences can be consumed flawlessly. Business owners expect these services to be exceptionally competitive and deliver Business KPI results.\n\nCisco’s combined approach provides a powerful way for customers to correlate business issues from end-user experience to application transactions and their dependencies, including the complete network path and Internet routing.\n\nFor more information and live demos visit us at\n\nAWS re:Invent\n\nCisco ThousandEyes @ Booth #1621 | Cisco Full-Stack Observability @ Booth #680\n\nShare:",

      "# [Microsoft 365 Services Hit By Outage by Wade Tyler Millward](https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2024/microsoft-365-services-hit-by-outage)\nThis is at least the third major outage for Microsoft in July.\n\nDays after a faulty CrowdStrike update downed millions of Windows machines worldwide and a coincidental Microsoft Azure region outage in the United States, Microsoft has reported “access issues and degraded performance” for a variety of services and features under its Microsoft 365 umbrella.\n\nThe Redmond, Wash.-based cloud and AI tools vendor posted to X – formerly known as Twitter – at 5:48 a.m. Pacific Time on Tuesday that “we’re currently investigating access issues and degraded performance with multiple Microsoft 365 services and features,” according to the X post. “More information can be found under MO842351 in the admin center. The outage occurred just hours before Microsoft reports earnings for its fourth fiscal quarter.\n\nAt 7:51 a.m. Pacific, Microsoft added: “We’ve applied mitigations and rerouted user requests to provide relief. We're monitoring the service to confirm resolution and further information can be found at https://status.cloud.microsoft or under MO842351 in the admin center.” When a CRN reporter tried to access the cloud status website about 10 minutes after the X post, the reporter received a “site can’t be reached” error message.\n\n[RELATED: Microsoft Q4 2024 Earnings Preview: 5 Things To Know]\n\nMicrosoft 365 Outage\n\nCRN has reached out to Microsoft for comment.\n\nOn a Microsoft Azure Status website, the vendor said that “starting approximately at 11:45 UTC on 30 July 2024, a subset of customers may have experienced issues connecting to Microsoft services globally.”\n\n“We have implemented networking configuration changes and have performed failovers to alternate networking paths to provide relief,” according to the status page. Monitoring telemetry shows improvement in service availability from approximately 14:10 UTC onwards, and we are continuing to monitor to ensure full recovery.\n\nA chart breaking down the issues warned that users of any region in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) could face network infrastructure issues.\n\nOokla’s Downdetector website showed reports of M365 outages reaching a 24-hour high of 363 Tuesday around 6:22 a.m. Pacific. Azure outage reports reached a 24-hour high of 483 at around the same time.\n\nUsers in the “SysAdmin” Subreddit reported experiencing outages in Eastern Europe, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the Eastern U.S.\n\nSome users found humor in the situation. “Why does Team's never go down for me? An afternoon free of calls or messages would be lovely,” one user wrote, referring to Microsoft’s popular communications and collaboration platform.\n\nJuly 19 Outage\n\nThe outage does not appear related to the firestorm that has erupted since a faulty CrowdStrike update interfered with millions of Windows machines on July 19 – with some Windows users including Delta Air Lines still dealing with the effects of the outage days later.\n\nHours before the CrowdStrike incident, “Microsoft experienced an unrelated (outage) that affected access to various Azure services and customer accounts configured with a single-region service in the Central US region,” according to a July 26 blog post by Cisco subsidiary ThousandEyes.\n\n“This outage occurred around the same time as the CrowdStrike incident, from 9:56 PM (UTC) on July 18 to 12:15 PM (UTC) on July 19,” according to the post. “The close timing of the two incidents may have caused some confusion and led to the larger global IT outage being mistakenly attributed to Microsoft. Although Microsoft systems were affected during the CrowdStrike incident, it was completely unrelated to the Azure incident.”\n\nThe outage included “failures of service management operations and connectivity or availability of services,” with ThousandEyes saying that “connectivity into the Central US region appeared impaired, with forwarding loss being observed at the ingress points to the affected region … Among those impacted were Confluent, Elastic Cloud, and Microsoft 365.”\n\n“Microsoft’s status update also identified a configuration change as the underlying cause that impacted the connectivity of backend services, specifically storage clusters and compute resources. This then triggered some automated mitigation with services being restarted repeatedly.”\n\nThousandEyes also reported on an Azure issue July 13 that led to service interruptions for Grammarly.\n\n“Azure reported that the Azure OpenAI (AOAI) service has an automation system that is implemented regionally but uses a global configuration to manage the lifecycle for certain backend resources,” according to the report. “A change was made to update this configuration to delete unused resources in an AOAI internal subscription. There was a quota on the number of storage accounts on this subscription, which were unused and intended to be cleaned up to prevent storage quota pressure.”",

      "# [Re: Introducing ThousandEyes on Meraki MX❗️ by community.meraki.com, user-id on 2023-11-16](https://community.meraki.com/t5/Security-SD-WAN/Introducing-ThousandEyes-on-Meraki-MX-%EF%B8%8F/m-p/215905)\nHi @DarrenOC ! Anyone can try it!\n\n- Enterprise customers can ask for a trial of the Secure SD-WAN Plus experience which has ThousandEyes tests\n\n- Advanced Security customers can activate a 90 day trial from the dashboard\n\n- Secure SD-WAN Plus customers have an entitlement to ThousandEyes tests - just activate in the dashboard!\n\nHope that helps!\n\nPratik Desai\n\nMeraki SD-WAN PMM\n\nConsider it an added bonus! The value for Secure SD-WAN Plus license customers is that they can do a 90 day trial, AND once they're done, can activate their entitlement thereafter. It's all done in the same place - the Meraki dashboard. And the tests? They don't expire as long as there is an active Secure SD-WAN Plus license!\n\nPratik Desai\n\nMeraki SD-WAN PMM\n\nSounds promising @JonasD!\n\nI guess one of the biggest issues currently is licensing:\n\nAt least, one of the \"bigger\" licenses is needed to actually use this feature\n\nOn top of that, ThousandEyes licensing comes into play that makes it a lot harder (for the typical Meraki customer) to dive deeper into that topic.\n\nSomewhere it's mentioned that the licensing situation is to be improved and I can only hope this will come sooner or later. Something like a bundled \"Advanced Security plus complete M365 / Webex / ... monitoring would be a lot easier to consume than what's currently existing.\n\nI consider myself a big fan of additional monitoring capabilities in the Meraki platform, however I am thus far disappointed in this launch.\n\n-Advanced Security, and especially Advanced Security + Insight not getting any ThousandEyes entitlement at all? Insight was already a hard sell because of its lack of value, but then to say go buy your own licenses or upgrade all the way to Secure SD WAN +? You are practically selling competitor products for them at this price point.\n\n-\"Credits\" and a limited number of tests makes no sense in the first place when I am running these tests from my own hardware, if I license my hardware for a feature I should be able to use as much of it as the platform will permit."
