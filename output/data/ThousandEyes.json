You couldn't connect to our website? We show in this city of Arizona there was an outage and none of the Thousand Eye agents could reach us. It's a big deal for us since we're expected to be up 24/7. Same thing with seeing latency. For instance,  there was latency testing against our website from the Philippines,  but everywhere else it was less than 1 second. We were able to drill down and determine which ISP had an issue at that given time.\n\n### Comment ID i5g2nwb with +3 score by [(Stegles, Reddit, 2022-04-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/u78idu/experiences_with_thousandeyes/i5g2nwb/) (in reply to ID i5es10x):\nHow has helping to troubleshoot other peoples problems helped YOUR business though?\n\n#### Comment ID i5hw8co with +3 score by [(localpref, Reddit, 2022-04-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/u78idu/experiences_with_thousandeyes/i5hw8co/) (in reply to ID i5g2nwb):\nNot the OP, but using ThousandEyes in this way has benefited my business and my team in a couple of different ways.\n\n1. We can influence inbound or route around outbound issues, by depreferring or completely shutting down peering with our upstream SPs. This has been useful and practical even with ASes 2-3 hops away from us, though usually if they are smaller networks that have only a few paths to/from us.\n2. Share ThousandEyes data with NOCs that insist there is no problem in their network or with our peering points.  Of course useful only with our direct peers. This can shorten time to resolution for my team, or give us ammo to request SLA credits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn both cases, it is mostly useful when the problem is persistent, longer lasting or recurring often. It doesn't benefit us if it's transient as we have to do all the identification and mitigation manually but that's more an \"us\" problem and not necessarily a factor of any monitoring tool like ThousandEyes.\n\n#### Comment ID i5lsrb9 with +1 score by [(Bubbasdahname, Reddit, 2022-04-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/u78idu/experiences_with_thousandeyes/i5lsrb9/) (in reply to ID i5g2nwb):\nIf we are down, we have to pay SLA fees. Depending on how long we are down or how bad the latency is, it could be in the thousands times the number of clients. That can add up quickly.\n\n## Comment ID i5hl09z with +2 score by [(certpals, Reddit, 2022-04-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/u78idu/experiences_with_thousandeyes/i5hl09z/) (in reply to ID u78idu):\nTheir page load test is amazing.

All of our licenses came from units bundled with Cat9k purchases, so I can’t speak to the pricing front. \n\nSince we have very limited licenses, we do not run any tests 24/7/365.

Another tool for the tool belt. Whether it's a user's home connection or not, if its a work provided PC/laptop in which they reporting as having issues on, they're going to reach out to their workplace's support first almost 99% of the time. \n\n2. Split-tunnel + \"internet website is slow\" =/= not my problem. Cloud services need to be taken into consideration and to do so sanely, you need some insight from the perspective of the user's connection. This is also huge in cases where suddenly multiple or a subset of users are reporting similar issues and tools such as TE, you may be able to quickly identify this is an issue with a provider/region or even know about it before the report come in. Instantly slashing to time needed to investigate 10s or 100s of support cases.\n\n3. May be controversial but non-voluntary and required WFH change, at least for post-employment perspective, does impose at minimum a very high level support requirement of the business (some case required legal reimbursement). 99% of users know zero networking, purchase the cheapest plans and use the provided combo routers which serves their purposes. So when they move to WFH and suddenly have difficulty maintaining their level of work due to connectivity issues, the business should at least provide incredible basic tshooting or at least guidance whether on what to relay to their provider or a potential requirement to upgrade their service/equipment. I have witnessed remote users spend hundreds on routers (due to marketing non-sense) and stuck in contracts due to service plan upgrades because they were grasping at straws for a stable work experience and in the end being let go when it could have been solved with basic tshooting.\n\nBasically, if you're going to have to deal with the support request regardless, a tool that speeds up tshooting and reduces back and forth conversations has a value of its own. Time spent even reading a support case is time spent not working on other support cases. That time is a cost in and of itself.\n\n#### Comment ID i8uwm46 with +1 score by [(ChuckIT82, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uqvmps/anyone_using_thousandeyes_endpoint_agents/i8uwm46/) (in reply to ID i8uktkx):\nexact same 3 points why we're using it.\n\n### Comment ID i8u6xc0 with +6 score by [(certpals, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uqvmps/anyone_using_thousandeyes_endpoint_agents/i8u6xc0/) (in reply to ID i8u4kw2):\nThat's exactly what I thought.

But I work in a small enough org (approx 250 users), where if executive Bob has issues at home, it is still IT's problem. And even if it's receptionist Jane and she puts a ticket in while working from home, we still investigate instead of saying \"sorry, since you are at home we can't troubleshoot\".\n\nBut to be honest, my post doesn't necessarily come from only that type of scenario. Last week, we had users at a branch complain of performance issues with Salesforce. Well, at HQ we didn't have any issues with Salesforce, and the network didn't have any obvious red flags (I have a network monitor at our datacenter, and the traffic to that branch seemed fine, the throughput seemed fine, ping, tracert, etc all seemed fine). So there I am trying to figure out why this site was having performance issues to Salesforce, with no visibility as to why the issue was only impacting them. And at the time, I remember thinking to myself: \"doesn't something like ThousandEyes have the ability to say \"here is where the issue is between your user and Salesforce\"?\"\n\nTurns out the issue was a portion of the Salesforce page was trying to load from Germany, and Germany was blocked at that branch.\n\n#### Comment ID i8unrc1 with +2 score by [(Syde80, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uqvmps/anyone_using_thousandeyes_endpoint_agents/i8unrc1/) (in reply to ID i8udlma):\n> where if executive Bob has issues at home, it is still IT's problem.\n\nThis is something I really love from having moved from a smaller org to municipal government.

The path visualisation, experience score, the waterfall chart and local network (both wired and wireless) are some cool features.

As we had license use from purchases. Typical Cisco model get you some free-ish use and charge more for the good things. However, it reallllly does help pinpoint things quickly. But like anything it takes knowledge in understanding the tool. So you will have some learning curve. I personally have used thousandeyes sense 2007-ish before it was purchased by Cisco. It started off as a great BGP monitor. And it excels in that space. But the addons and growth they’ve had is awesome. API tests, snmp, ip reachability and throughput measures, endpoint monitoring, ms teams and other messaging integration, webhooks, synthetic monitoring with waterfall page load data.

It'll establish baselines for you though, then you can know when things are different.\n\nOne of the positives of ThousandEyes is that it can get data from other sensors that report into the TE system.  So when someone starts having issues -- let's say VPN begins to suck -- you can look and go \"aha!  There was a BGP path change between Seattle and Portland!\"  (Or whatever.)  You wouldn't necessarily be able to do that without other sensors within the system.\n\nNot saying it's the be-all and end-all of solutions, but that's one of the theoretical benefits of it.  I think there's an alternative out there -- I want to say built with open source software -- but I don't recall the name of it right now.

Where ThousandEyes shines is breaking Silo’s: having tangible evidence that the network is not at fault for application slowness, or is at fault, with a good indication of where the problem is. Helping in escalation, using a snapshot to make sure all parties are looking at the same data, so you can move to solving much quicker. \n\nThe most Happy customers integrate ThousandEyes in their workflow: if only an L3 network engineer looks at it chances are high that you won’t realize full potential: ideally you use it to prevent tickets going to those engineers. \n\nI would really advice you tot have a chat with your Cisco/ Thousandeyes  SE about what you want to achieve and how to best do that.

We didn't use the enterprise agents due to overly conservative cybersecurity restrictions.\n\nThe solution is good. It's very easy and quick to set up, and you can get a lot of information from it. Specifically, for a typical HTTPS server use case, you get the success rates and latencies of DNS lookup, the path trace, TCP latency, TLS negotiation and issues etc. You can also check the consistency of your DNSSEC delegations, do basic BGP watching, test against FTP servers and some other non-web stuff. It takes a screenshot and shows you when the presented web page changed, for example if you got hacked, or the server threw an error. You can also go whole hog and script an entire e-commerce transaction from start to checkout.\n\nYou get a reasonably decent alerting capability, and good management-friendly reports. The pre- and post-sales support was very good.\n\nA super nifty feature is the ability to share a specific test period/result. For example, if one of your SaaS vendors goes down for a maintenance window and claim they didn't, you can send them a link so they can look at your test results for their destination and a specific time. Or if there was a backbone hiccup, you can send the link to your ISP so they can look at it themselves.\n\nThere are other options like catchpoint etc. which are specialised in web app and page performance, telling you exactly how long what on a page takes, profiles backends and databases etc. but they don't tell you nearly as much about the path a user took to get to the server. So yes, it's partially overlapping functionality, but only partially, so depends on your use case.\n\nOverall we really liked it; the main problem was that it is really expensive. Once you start running tests from a dozen regions against a few dozen targets every five minutes, you're starting to look at mid to high five figures a year.\n\n## Comment ID m6bds4l with +4 score by [(Mr_Assault_08, Reddit, 2025-01-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1hxpsz5/experience_with_thousandeyes/m6bds4l/) (in reply to ID 1hxpsz5):\nif you only see a trace route then your either closed your mind on the product or you have a bad sales rep. \n\nit goes beyond trace route and can hit websites and see if you get a response. in certain applications it can even login, workday for example. \n\nmonitor websites that are critical to the business. if you all use O365 then you can monitor your company performance to it.  \n\nthat’s just a few examples, but you need to work with your rep. the whole point is to save yourself and team the time it takes to investigate issues.\n\n## Comment ID m6bstiq with +3 score by [(antron2000, Reddit, 2025-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1hxpsz5/experience_with_thousandeyes/m6bstiq/) (in reply to ID 1hxpsz5):\nHad an engineer that kept complaining about slow network speeds.

I actually did this with Zabbix monitoring software a few years ago for the large number of customers and devices we were monitoring. \nZabbix also recently released their own template for monitoring Meraki networks, which if you have a smaller amount of devices, would work great. I personally needed to modify that template extensively to make use of it though because of the limits Meraki places on API calls. One I have the time I'll probably part that modified version here and on my GitHub app others in similar situations can use and improve upon my work.\n\n## Comment ID jd995bf with +2 score by [(GezusK, Reddit, 2023-03-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/meraki/comments/11ydm1l/what_do_you_use_for_network_monitoring/jd995bf/) (in reply to ID 11ydm1l):\nWe've been checking out CheckMK.

Does the global protect agent monitor and log dropped / fragmented packets, high latency, etc.?\n\nIs there a 3rd party solution?

Use something blast out ping packets to each client in parallel (my script runs under windows and uses a win32 API to do this. If your scripting language doesn't have an asynch ping, you could always use fping. Do this a few times (5 maybe back to back) and record the min and max latency, and percent lost. Repeat every X minutes.\n\nYou'd undoubtedly need multiple servers to hit 3000 clients (probably use one server/script per gateway)\n\nYou could also grab the client's public IP and do a traceroute to it and record the resulting path. MTR has a handy output format that is meant to be parsed.\n\nStore the results in database of choice.

I don't manage it. That fact prevents me from creating code to use the API. It never ceases to piss me off that Palo won't do a read-only API option. Every time I bring it to my account rep, he says that modern programming environments have credential vaults, so it's not a problem. I've tried to explain that there's no credential vault that can survive a determined user with root access, but it falls on deaf ears.\n\nThe few programs that I do have that use the API are behind a web server and I use explicit authentication so that the script can grab the user's id and password. I then use the id/password version of the API auth to access.\n\nPalo REALY needs to pull their heads out of their collective ass and come up with a read-only option for the API.\n\nAlternately, they need to expose this stuff via SNMP.

Here it is.\n\nThanks Lee\n\nPre-tunnel latency:\r  \n==============\r  \n\r  \n\\- Based on OpenSSL handshake\r  \n\\- This is the same handshake that is used to check gateway availability and calculate weight based on response time during gateway selection process\r  \n\\- Measuring the time from initial SYN (TCP 3-way handshake) until SSL Close Notify\r  \n\r  \nPost-tunnel latency:\r  \n===============\r  \n\r  \n\\- Measured after tunnel has been established\r  \n\\- Measuring RTT for a single tunnel keep-alive ICMP probe sent within the tunnel (same as tunnel keepalives)\r  \n\r  \nNOTE :\r  \n\r  \n1. Pre-tunnel latency is calculated during gateway selection/discovery process\r  \n2. Post-tunnel latency is almost always faster as it measures single keep-alive RTT and not the whole handshake (TCP and SSL)\r  \n3.

We haven't had a ton of issues but on a case-by-case basis we usually have them do a speedtest off vpn, and then do an internal speed test on our intranet to gauge the VPN throughput.  This obviously doesn't account for a lot of potential issues but atleast gives us a quick idea of what their connection is like.  Most issues are poor wi-fi from carrier provided modems. We did have some issues with some users that were in a split-tunnel config, when Comcast started using [10.0.0.0/x](https://10.0.0.0/x) as their default dhcp scope a while back as it coincided with one of our internal subnets.\n\nThis isn't something we are currently monitoring but this have given me a push to look into it. thanks!\n\n## Comment ID gw1cans with +1 score by [(zbiles, Reddit, 2021-04-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/paloaltonetworks/comments/mz1fmv/global_protect_endpoint_connection_performance/gw1cans/) (in reply to ID mz1fmv):\nThe product thousandeyes (just acquired by Cisco) has a small client app you can run on machines to gather performance data like traceroute, latency, jitter, RTT, etc. a little pricey but would likely give you what you’re looking for."

          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "Now, on to the negatives.\r\n\r\n * Culture of dishonesty: If a customer finds a major bug, it may be brushed off and fixed silently. If engineering finds a bug that affects customers and they don't know, it's silently fixed and no credits/notice is given, even for core functionality. Staff do not want to trust customers with the truth and feel that they can better earn their trust by hiding problems from them by lying. Staff may also not trust themselves for repercussions of their own bugs.\r\n\r\n * Fishy use of J1 VISAs for full-time, non-intern employees from abroad. You are quite likely reading this as someone outside of the US and may not know what a J1 is. If you don't, please read up on J1 VISAs. ThousandEyes will generally submit an application for an H1B VISA. Unfortunately, the process sucks and many people don't get accepted. What's sketchy is that they follow it up with a J1 VISA application if the H1B VISA doesn't go through. H1B is for workers, J1 is very explictly for interns at most. ThousandEyes had had one intern in all of my time there, the rest were clearly full time employees. The J1 VISA employees at ThousandEyes often have to fill out forms saying what they learned. These are things they probably learned ten years ago. While immigration is difficult in the US, I say this because you need to be aware that there is a chance (I am not a lawyer) than if you are sponsored on a J1 VISA for a non-intern position in ThousandEyes, you are doing something illegal (as would be ThousandEyes). Furthermore, there's a chance that ThousandEyes, if busted, might send you back home with a very difficult time immigrating in the future. Maybe in this political climate that will never happen, I don't know. But new recruits are not told this as far as I know, and you should know because it may be a huge risk. If you are from abroad, please read up on US immigration, J1 VISAs, and H1B VISAs. One last thing. If you do come in on an H1B VISA, salary information is public. You can go online and search for the salaries of many of the ThousandEyes staff. Maybe you don't want to do this, that's fine. But you should be told because it is public and thus no secret. You can do the same thing for Google, Facebook, etc, if you want to.\r\n\r\n * Not a very organic culture, discussions about the product often end up being told to go to off-topic areas. In particular, the VP of engineering will shoot down these conversations, but several in engineering are not very open minded. All in all, the culture at the dining table is pretty good, but when it comes to working it's not always the greatest mix.\r\n\r\n * The engineering staff is a huge mix of cultures. Most people speak English as a second language. This is very nice for diversity, but there are some obvious communication difficulties. All and all, cultural differences seem to be handled quite well. I've made some great friends there. Still, communication can be difficult.\r\n\r\n * Sales is in the same office and rarely stays around engineering for happy hours and such. There's a little bit of tension over their distance.Sales rarely stick around for lunch. Their turnover rate is very, very high (many gone in 3 months).\r\n\r\n * While this may or may not be exactly true, many of the engineers have more education than experience. While this is not a problem in and of itself, there are some narrow minds there that take a while to open up. I would advise that they emphasize more on experience in the future, rather than pulling in PHD students without professional experience.\r\n\r\n * After working around the product for eleven months, I was not impressed with it. It's helpful, but seems stop-gap. Feel free to open up a trial account and see for yourself how you feel about it.\r\n\r\n * The product is very enterprise focused. You have to buy it in one-year contract terms. This upsets me because I'd like to use the paid product, but there's almost no way I'm going to sign a year-long contract to do that. You may or may not like enterprise-centric businesses, so keep in mind that in mind.\r\n\r\n * All in all, it's the dishonesty that kills me. There are a lot of unhappy employees at ThousandEyes but they haven't left because of the difficulties in switching jobs over VISAs, or because they are in the greencard process. There are a lot of happy employees too, but I found that more of them had not had much prior work experience. It is my experience that there are many better companies in the area and in the US as a whole that you can work at. Places where the business is honest to its customers, where employees hear each other out, and where innovation is a bit more sensible. It's not a bad company, but it's not really good either. While there are many glowing reviews here, I recommend that you move along to a better place until there are significant changes at ThousandEyes. If some day they start openly sharing about their outages (and not other company's outages, which they use for publicity) and bugs, it may be a good sign things have changed. I do feel a bit attached and I like the company in many ways, but it has a long way to go, and unfortunately a lot of that work starts at the top.",

If this comes up without newlines, pipe this through sed replacing * with two newlines. ThousandEyes is a pretty small company and to some it may be obvious who I am. In the interest of an open and honest review, hopefully to your benefit, I will not try to be overly generic. I'd also like to focus a bit more on the positives. I am a former employee and I was there for eleven months. In my absense there have been some positive changes from what I hear.\r\n\r\n * The founders are tech savvy and sharp. Mohit gives good speeches. Ricardo is a bit of a networking wizard.\r\n\r\n * The food is great. There are off days here and there, but they make a great effort to have good catered food.\r\n\r\n * The office management staff is phenomenal. I miss a particularly warm smile every time I came into the office, possibly one of the best parts of my day.\r\n\r\n * Generous stock options.\r\n\r\n * I was once skeptical about pay, but it seems to be on par. You could probably make more at a non-startup, but either way you won't be making much with the insane cost of living in San Francisco. (50k in a normal city will offer a better quality of life than 100k in SF)\r\n\r\n * Business is doing great: The customer list is incredible, as is the growth.\r\n\r\n * Very fun offsites here and there. Overall, there's a decent community element between the employees.\r\n\r\n * Interesting technical challenges. A lot of the problems ThousandEyes faces are somewhat unique, both internally and intrinsically imposed. I had some pretty interesting things to do while I was there. There were some dumb grunt workish jobs at times, but overall I was given a good bit of flexibility. I would propose writing an in-house solution and work on it all on my own at times, rather than be forced to use something out of the box that didn't quite fit.\r\n\r\n * There's a high bar for code in some parts of the company. While it's annoying at times, I feel I really learned a lot by having such high standards put on what I was doing.",

        "cons": "Now, on to the negatives.\r\n\r\n * Culture of dishonesty: If a customer finds a major bug, it may be brushed off and fixed silently. If engineering finds a bug that affects customers and they don't know, it's silently fixed and no credits/notice is given, even for core functionality. Staff do not want to trust customers with the truth and feel that they can better earn their trust by hiding problems from them by lying. Staff may also not trust themselves for repercussions of their own bugs.\r\n\r\n * Fishy use of J1 VISAs for full-time, non-intern employees from abroad. You are quite likely reading this as someone outside of the US and may not know what a J1 is. If you don't, please read up on J1 VISAs. ThousandEyes will generally submit an application for an H1B VISA. Unfortunately, the process sucks and many people don't get accepted. What's sketchy is that they follow it up with a J1 VISA application if the H1B VISA doesn't go through. H1B is for workers, J1 is very explictly for interns at most. ThousandEyes had had one intern in all of my time there, the rest were clearly full time employees. The J1 VISA employees at ThousandEyes often have to fill out forms saying what they learned. These are things they probably learned ten years ago. While immigration is difficult in the US, I say this because you need to be aware that there is a chance (I am not a lawyer) than if you are sponsored on a J1 VISA for a non-intern position in ThousandEyes, you are doing something illegal (as would be ThousandEyes). Furthermore, there's a chance that ThousandEyes, if busted, might send you back home with a very difficult time immigrating in the future. Maybe in this political climate that will never happen, I don't know. But new recruits are not told this as far as I know, and you should know because it may be a huge risk. If you are from abroad, please read up on US immigration, J1 VISAs, and H1B VISAs. One last thing. If you do come in on an H1B VISA, salary information is public. You can go online and search for the salaries of many of the ThousandEyes staff. Maybe you don't want to do this, that's fine. But you should be told because it is public and thus no secret. You can do the same thing for Google, Facebook, etc, if you want to.\r\n\r\n * Not a very organic culture, discussions about the product often end up being told to go to off-topic areas. In particular, the VP of engineering will shoot down these conversations, but several in engineering are not very open minded. All in all, the culture at the dining table is pretty good, but when it comes to working it's not always the greatest mix.\r\n\r\n * The engineering staff is a huge mix of cultures. Most people speak English as a second language. This is very nice for diversity, but there are some obvious communication difficulties. All and all, cultural differences seem to be handled quite well. I've made some great friends there. Still, communication can be difficult.\r\n\r\n * Sales is in the same office and rarely stays around engineering for happy hours and such. There's a little bit of tension over their distance.Sales rarely stick around for lunch. Their turnover rate is very, very high (many gone in 3 months).\r\n\r\n * While this may or may not be exactly true, many of the engineers have more education than experience. While this is not a problem in and of itself, there are some narrow minds there that take a while to open up. I would advise that they emphasize more on experience in the future, rather than pulling in PHD students without professional experience.\r\n\r\n * After working around the product for eleven months, I was not impressed with it. It's helpful, but seems stop-gap. Feel free to open up a trial account and see for yourself how you feel about it.\r\n\r\n * The product is very enterprise focused. You have to buy it in one-year contract terms. This upsets me because I'd like to use the paid product, but there's almost no way I'm going to sign a year-long contract to do that. You may or may not like enterprise-centric businesses, so keep in mind that in mind.\r\n\r\n * All in all, it's the dishonesty that kills me. There are a lot of unhappy employees at ThousandEyes but they haven't left because of the difficulties in switching jobs over VISAs, or because they are in the greencard process. There are a lot of happy employees too, but I found that more of them had not had much prior work experience. It is my experience that there are many better companies in the area and in the US as a whole that you can work at. Places where the business is honest to its customers, where employees hear each other out, and where innovation is a bit more sensible. It's not a bad company, but it's not really good either. While there are many glowing reviews here, I recommend that you move along to a better place until there are significant changes at ThousandEyes. If some day they start openly sharing about their outages (and not other company's outages, which they use for publicity) and bugs, it may be a good sign things have changed. I do feel a bit attached and I like the company in many ways, but it has a long way to go, and unfortunately a lot of that work starts at the top.",

        "pros": "I've edited my review to try and make it more useful. Glassdoor may not support newline separation. If this comes up without newlines, pipe this through sed replacing * with two newlines. ThousandEyes is a pretty small company and to some it may be obvious who I am. In the interest of an open and honest review, hopefully to your benefit, I will not try to be overly generic. I'd also like to focus a bit more on the positives. I am a former employee and I was there for eleven months. In my absense there have been some positive changes from what I hear.\r\n\r\n * The founders are tech savvy and sharp. Mohit gives good speeches. Ricardo is a bit of a networking wizard.\r\n\r\n * The food is great. There are off days here and there, but they make a great effort to have good catered food.\r\n\r\n * The office management staff is phenomenal. I miss a particularly warm smile every time I came into the office, possibly one of the best parts of my day.\r\n\r\n * Generous stock options.\r\n\r\n * I was once skeptical about pay, but it seems to be on par. You could probably make more at a non-startup, but either way you won't be making much with the insane cost of living in San Francisco. (50k in a normal city will offer a better quality of life than 100k in SF)\r\n\r\n * Business is doing great: The customer list is incredible, as is the growth.\r\n\r\n * Very fun offsites here and there. Overall, there's a decent community element between the employees.\r\n\r\n * Interesting technical challenges. A lot of the problems ThousandEyes faces are somewhat unique, both internally and intrinsically imposed. I had some pretty interesting things to do while I was there. There were some dumb grunt workish jobs at times, but overall I was given a good bit of flexibility. I would propose writing an in-house solution and work on it all on my own at times, rather than be forced to use something out of the box that didn't quite fit.\r\n\r\n * There's a high bar for code in some parts of the company. While it's annoying at times, I feel I really learned a lot by having such high standards put on what I was doing.",

      "# [ThousandEyes Documentation on 2025-02-03](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/whats-new/changelog)\n2025-02-03\n\nCisco ThousandEyes App for Splunk now Available\n\nWe’re excited to announce the official release of the Cisco ThousandEyes App for Splunk, now available for download on Splunkbase.\n\nThis app enables customers to monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize their digital experience by integrating ThousandEyes powerful insights into Splunk dashboards. The app leverages ThousandEyes OpenTelemetry (OTel) streams, APIs, and Splunk’s Common Information Model (CIM) to deliver actionable intelligence through customizable visualizations.\n\nWith this release, customers can stream ThousandEyes tests, events, and activity log data into Splunk using the app.\n\nFor installation and configuration details, see Cisco ThousandEyes App for Splunk.\n\nAnnouncing New Routing Section for BGP\n\nOn February 19th, 2025, we are introducing a new \"Routing\" landing page in the left-hand navigation menu which will feature four submenus: Views, Test Settings, and BGP Monitors. The BGP test creation and view functionalities will be moved from the Cloud and Enterprise Agents (CEA) section to the new \"Routing\" section. BGP views will still be available in CEA views for any network measurement tests with \"Collect BGP data\" previously checked.\n\n2025-01-29\n\nEnhancements to the Test Settings Table\n\nAs previously announced, we’ve enhanced the test settings table with some long-awaited quality-of-life improvements. As of February 20th, the classic test settings page will be replaced with this improved user interface and workflow.\n\nBug Fixes 2025-01-29\n\nFixed a template validation issue in Endpoint templates.\n\nFixed an issue where the template agent drop down wasn't supporting interface selection.\n\n2025-01-28\n\nAs previously announced, we have implemented an interim solution for WiFi reporting on Windows 11 24H2 and above. For a permanent solution and in line with the Operating System manufacturer guidelines, ThousandEyes recommends enabling location services in the global machine setting.\n\nUsers must enable location services within their operating systems to allow us to report this information to the ThousandEyes user interface.\n\nOnce users grant location permissions, the following issues will be resolved:\n\nSSID and BSSID values will be displayed in reports.\n\nSSID information will be populated in tables.\n\nThe Wireless Info and Connection segments will show SSID/BSSID information.\n\nLabels based on SSID/BSSID will function properly, and test assignments relying on these labels will also work as intended.\n\nData tagging: Data points will be tagged correctly, and filtering functionality will be restored.\n\nWhat is not supported: For users who have not opted-in, reports will display a fixed value in the format Unknown SSID - Agent Name / Unknown BSSID - Agent Name.\n\nWe are releasing a new version of the Endpoint Agent for macOS users on February 4th, 2025. This update addresses the issue of missing SSID/BSSID information. The new agent will introduce a pop-up requesting end users to grant location permissions.\n\nIf you would like to delay this update by 15 or 30 days to have additional time to inform your user base, please contact us at support@thousandeyes.com.\n\n2025-01-22\n\nUpgrading libcurl for all Cloud and Enterprise Agents\n\nBeginning Thursday, January 23rd, with an expected completion date of Thursday, January 30th, we will be doing a staged rollout of an update to the libcurl package we ship with the ThousandEyes Cloud and Enterprise Agents used for conducting HTTP server tests. The new version of libcurl will be based on version 8.5.0 with security patches backported.\n\nNo action is required on the part of most customers, as the Enterprise Agent is auto-updating. For customers that have turned off auto-updates, you should ensure you update to the latest Enterprise Agent release to minimize the risk of compatibility issues.\n\n2025-01-17\n\nEnd of Installation Support for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (“Focal”)\n\nAs previously announced in December, installation support for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (“Focal”) will end on January 31st, 2025. Updated images and packages for all affected installation types have been released, as well as an automated updated functionality for the ThousandEyes Virtual Appliance (TEVA) and the ThousandEyes Physical Appliance (TEPA) on the NUC and Raspberry Pi 4.\n\nPlease take action soon to ensure that your environment is running the latest available images. As noted in our Ubuntu Linux Support Lifecycle documentation, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (“Focal”) will enter End of Support on April 30th, 2025 and End of Life on June 30th, 2025. Security patching ceases with the End of Support period, and agents not upgraded prior to the End of Life date will stop submitting results to the ThousandEyes platform.\n\nFor more information on how to upgrade, see:\n\nFor Linux Packages, see Upgrading Linux Packages.\n\nFor TEVA and TEPA, you can use the automated upgrade capabilities built into the TEVA UI locally or within the ThousandEyes web application. You can also manually replace the image and use a virtual agent cluster to preserve the test configuration, using the instructions here: Replacing an Enterprise Agent Using the Agent Clustering Method.\n\nFor Linux Docker agents, see Upgrading Docker Agents.\n\nFor CAF Containers for Cisco Devices, see Upgrading Cisco Devices.\n\nEvent Detection now available for US2/East Cloud\n\nEvent detection for Cloud & Enterprise Agents is now available to all US2/East cloud customers.\n\n2025-01-16\n\nOAuth 2.0 Authentication Method for API Test Type\n\nThe API test type now supports OAuth 2.0 as an authentication method. A new token is generated for each test round. The Step Builder automates the creation of this API call and saves the token for subsequent steps. See the OAuth portion of Using the Step Builder for more information.\n\n2025-01-08\n\nEnterprise Agent Support for Cisco ISR1k Routers\n\nWith the release of IOS-XE 17.16.1, ThousandEyes now supports installing Enterprise Agents on the following Cisco Integrated Services Routers (ISR) using the command line interface (CLI) or the SD-WAN Manager (previously vManage):\n\nISR 1111X\n\nISR 1121X\n\nISR 1126X\n\nISR 1127X\n\nISR 1131X\n\nISR 1161X\n\nFor a detailed list of supported devices and system requirements, see the Service Routing Support Matrix.\n\n2025-01-06\n\nEndpoint Agent Client Version 1.226.1\n\nThe following enhancements have been made to the Endpoint Agent client:\n\nAll Platforms\n\nWe recommend selecting the Auto-detect option for the protocol in a real user test.\n\nFixed a bug where the agent reported a test mode used for network tests when the tests weren't run, for example, due to the active VPN blocking all network tests.\n\nThe Auto-detect option is enhanced to generate path traces more reliably when the target sometimes refuses TCP connections.\n\nResolved an issue that could cause proxy-related tests to fail until the agent was restarted.\n\nWhile running HTTP tests with the Perform network measurements turned off, the agent would report an error due to missing network test results.\n\nPreviously, the agent would not correctly respect HTTP tests that had requested IPv6-only results for name resolution. This issue has now been resolved.\n\nDeleting an agent via Agent Settings - no longer results in the agent service exiting when it next contacts the ThousandEyes backend. Instead, the agent service continues to run in an inactive state.\n\nWe added the ability to reduce the duplication of network tests towards the same target and use the same protocol to run at most once per minute, reducing the overall number of network tests run by the agent.\n\nEnhanced path tracing to generate more complete paths when remote hosts close connections aggressively.\n\nWindows\n\nThe agent is updated to continue support for ControlHub integration for the latest Webex releases.\n\nPreviously, a few users experienced issues with the agent on Windows 24H2 and later versions; it did not report any Wi-Fi metrics due to location service restrictions introduced in these updates. As a result, the wireless node was absent from the network path displayed in the ThousandEyes user interface. Now, the endpoint agent makes a concerted effort to report Wi-Fi metrics.\n\nPreviously, Windows 24H2 and later versions introduced restrictions on location services, resulting in a pop-up displayed to users. This pop-up asked whether to allow or disallow access to location services for the user-agent process. However, this should no longer be an issue, and users should not see any pop-up notifications regarding location access.\n\nThe algorithm for the Auto-detect option for protocol selection is improved to enhance the path trace mode, resulting in the discovery of complete paths.\n\nmacOS\n\nIn the upcoming releases, the automatic update will migrate existing (x86_64) installations of macOS agents running on Apple Silicon to native (arm64) endpoint agents.\n\nPhoneOS\n\nEnhanced the algorithm for Auto-detect option (for protocol selection) for targets that initially accept TCP connections but subsequently refuse all connections.\n\n2024-12-12\n\nAnnouncing Cloud Insights for AWS\n\nCloud Insights offers new capabilities for monitoring and troubleshooting cloud native and hybrid cloud environments. These new capabilities include: • Extending test path visualization with display of the discovered cloud network topology • Tracking cloud network configuration changes correlated with performance and availability measurements • Visualizing cloud traffic flow information over time. Cloud Insights currently supports AWS hosted applications\n\nCloud Insights is available as a self-service trial for existing users. You can request a free trial of Cloud Insights directly within the ThousandEyes portal by navigating to Cloud Insights from the left-hand menu. Click Request Trial to activate your free trial. Cloud Insights is also available as an optional feature subscription. For more details, please see Cloud Insights.\n\n2024-12-11\n\nIntroducing ThousandEyes and Meraki Cross Domain Assurance\n\nWe are excited to introduce a new data integration between ThousandEyes and Meraki that allows for deeper visibility across the enterprise, the Internet, and applications. Customers will now be able to visually see inside our path visualization when an agent is installed on a Meraki MX device, get visibility into the network it is connected to, understand the MX WAN appliance score, and cross-link directly into the Meraki Assurance Overview page with the proper network context coming from ThousandEyes.\n\nThis integration provides a comprehensive view into the end-to-end service delivery chain, allowing IT to monitor every step, from local network devices to external ISPs and SaaS providers. This end-to-end approach enables IT to pinpoint the source of performance issues—whether on local networks, in transit, or at the application level—facilitating faster resolutions and enhancing productivity.\n\nFor more information, check out our documentation:\n\nMeraki for Data Enrichment\n\nUsing the Path Visualization View\n\n2024-12-10\n\nAdd an Annotation for resourceInclusion in the Template Creation Editor\n\nAs part of the work to allow users to opt-in to some tests rather than always requiring users to opt-out, a new resourceInclusion field has been added to custom templates to indicate whether a resource should be included in the deployment. In addition to tests, this covers resources such as dashboards, alert rules, and labels. This field is an object where the key is the key of the resource, and the value is either \"skipped\" or \"included\".\n\nTemplates Can Now Use Test Groupings\n\nMany tests are now visually grouped together for easier UI navigation.\n\nEnd of Installation Support for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (“Focal”)\n\nAs noted in our Ubuntu Linux Support Lifecycle documentation, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (\"Focal\") will enter the End of Support period on April 30th, 2025 and End of Life on June 30th, 2025.\n\nInstallation support for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (\"Focal\") ended for Ubuntu-based CAF agents on December 2nd, 2024, and for all other Ubuntu-based agents on January 31st, 2025. This affects:\n\nPackage-based installations.\n\nImage-based installations:\n\nThe ThousandEyes Virtual Appliance (TEVA) for VirtualBox, VMware ESXi, and Hyper-V.\n\nThe ThousandEyes Physical Appliance (TEPA) for Intel/ASUS NUC and Raspberry Pi 4.\n\nContainer images for Cisco Application Hosting Framework (CAF) for all Cisco Devices\n\nDocker for Linux container images.\n\nLinux packages for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (\"Jammy\"), as well as updated VM, ISO, and container images for all affected installation types, are already available. For detailed upgrade instructions and additional information, refer to the relevant links below.\n\nFor Linux package installations, see Upgrading Linux Packages.\n\nFor TEVA and TEPA installations, you can use the automated upgrade capabilities built into the TEVA UI locally or within the ThousandEyes web application. You can also manually replace the image and use a virtual agent cluster to preserve the test configuration, using the instructions here: Replacing an Enterprise Agent Using the Agent Clustering Method.\n\nFor CAF upgrade instructions, see: Upgrading Cisco Devices.\n\nFor Linux Docker instructions, see: Upgrading Docker Agents.\n\n2024-12-04\n\nPlatform Renaming and Information Architecture Changes\n\nThe ThousandEyes platform will undergo a number of changes over the next few months. While these changes will not impact our APIs or developer experience, they will impact the ThousandEyes platform user interface. These changes include, but are not limited to:\n\nRenaming the Cloud & Enterprise Agents menu item to \"Network & App Synthetics\".\n\nRenaming the Endpoint Agents menu item to Endpoint Experience.\n\nRenaming Snapshots to Public Snapshots.\n\nRenaming Saved Events to Private Snapshots.\n\nAdding a BGP Monitoring landing page to the left-hand navigation.\n\nAdding an Event Detection landing page to the left-hand navigation.\n\nStreamlining platform settings under a new Manage page in the left-hand navigation.\n\nThe full scope of changes will include renaming, re-ordering, and re-architecting the menu items in the left-hand navigation panel. Platform page URLs, elements, and technical documentation will be updated accordingly. The goal of these updates is to improve ease-of-use by providing more intuitive naming and user flows. More details will become available closer to the time of release.\n\n2024-12-03\n\nSAML Certificate Renewal Notice\n\nOn December 9th, 2024, we will renew ThousandEyes SAML certificate, and SAML metadata will then return a new certificate. If you use dynamic configuration for your SSO, your IdP server will automatically receive the new certificate. If you use a static or metadata-file configuration, we suggest you follow the SAML setup instructions mentioned here and update to the new certificate: SAML setup instructions\n\nIf you continue to use the old certificate for encrypting SAML assertions, users in your organization will no longer be able to log into ThousandEyes after February 7, 2025. The single logout feature will also be impacted.\n\nIf you have already renewed the certificate, no further actions are required.\n\nEnd of Installation Support for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (“Focal”)\n\nAs noted in our Ubuntu Linux Support Lifecycle documentation, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (\"Focal\") will enter the End of Support period on April 30th, 2025 and End of Life on June 30th, 2025.\n\nInstallation support for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (\"Focal\") ended for Ubuntu-based CAF agents on December 2nd, 2024, and for all other Ubuntu-based agents on January 31st, 2025. This affects:\n\nPackage-based installations.\n\nImage-based installations:\n\nThe ThousandEyes Virtual Appliance (TEVA) for VirtualBox, VMware ESXi, and Hyper-V.\n\nThe ThousandEyes Physical Appliance (TEPA) for Intel/ASUS NUC and Raspberry Pi 4.\n\nContainer images for Cisco Application Hosting Framework (CAF) for all Cisco Devices\n\nDocker for Linux container images.\n\nLinux packages for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (\"Jammy\"), as well as updated VM, ISO, and container images for all affected installation types, are already available. For detailed upgrade instructions and additional information, refer to the relevant links below.\n\nFor Linux package installations, see Upgrading Linux Packages.\n\nFor TEVA and TEPA installations, you can use the automated upgrade capabilities built into the TEVA UI locally or within the ThousandEyes web application. You can also manually replace the image and use a virtual agent cluster to preserve the test configuration, using the instructions here: Replacing an Enterprise Agent Using the Agent Clustering Method.\n\nFor CAF upgrade instructions, see: Upgrading Cisco Devices.\n\nFor Linux Docker instructions, see: Upgrading Docker Agents.\n\n2024-12-02\n\nNew Container Image Major Version for Cisco Devices\n\nWe have now released updated container images for Cisco devices to use with the Cisco Application Hosting Framework (CAF). These updated images are based on Alpine 3.20 to give customers the same benefits we previously brought with our release of updated Docker for Linux images in September 2024.\n\nThis release starts the 5.x major version series, replacing the current 4.x major version series which was based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.\n\nThere are a number of advantages for customers that come with this change, including the reduced amount of packages shipped in the Alpine Linux base, which allows us to make the image size more compact, reducing the security footprint of our container images, and opening the possibility of supporting a broader array of smaller hardware Cisco devices in the future.\n\nIn order to take advantage of these changes, you will need to update the container image on your Cisco devices. Image names now include the CPU architecture of the device, and we provide two separate images for CAF devices: one for X86-64 (x86_64), and one for ARM64 (aarch64).\n\nAll existing Cisco devices are X86-64. Future supported devices will include those based on ARM64.\n\nRandomized Start Time Available for Tests\n\nIt is now possible to enable tests to utilize a randomized start time via the API. This feature is useful for customers that have a large quantity of Cloud Agents or Enterprise Agents testing to the same target where it may impact the load of the target. By randomizing the start time of the tests within the configured interval, it reduces the concurrent load against the target. By default this is disabled for all tests, but can be enabled when necessary via the API. For more details see our developer documentation.\n\n2024-11-26\n\nConnected Devices Maintenance Announcement\n\nOn Wednesday, December 4, 2024 between 4-7 am UTC, we are performing some maintenance on the databases supporting SamKnows (now Connected Devices) in the EU1 (Europe) region. We are transitioning the SamKnows database clusters from Google Cloud Platform to Amazon Web Services. This maintenance includes a configuration change that will cause some disruptions to database connections, meaning some services may be degraded during the maintenance window.\n\nAffected components:\n\nSamKnows One (https://samknows.one)\n\nSamKnows APIs\n\nSamKnows RealSpeed\n\n2024-11-25\n\nThousandEyes Endpoint Agent on Cisco 9800 Series Desk Phones (PhoneOS)\n\nThousandEyes Endpoint Agent is now supported on Cisco Desk 9800 series phones, versions 9861 or 9871, registered with WCMT, WCDI, or UCM on firmware version v3.2 and above. By integrating PhoneOS device data with the endpoint agent capabilities, we can offer a comprehensive view of call quality issues when these devices are involved.\n\nKey Features:\n\nScheduled Test: Supported for Webex Calling Multi-Tenant (WCMT), Webex Calling Dedicated Instant (WCDI) and Unified Call Manager (UCM).\n\nDynamic Test (Webex): Meetings Supported for WCMT via hybrid calendar and Office 365 calendar for Webex, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom in the case of UCM and WCDI.\n\nDynamic Tests (Webex): SIP calls Supported. Please note that WCMT uses UDP/STUN via autodetect.\n\nPlatform Device Filters: Extended to PhoneOS.\n\nYou can learn about configuring and managing the Endpoint Agent on PhoneOS device by referring to the ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent and PhoneOS article, here.\n\nYou can learn more about enabling and configuring ThousandEyes on Webex in the following Webex Articles:\n\nEnable ThousandEyes on Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM)\n\nWebex Calling Dedicated Instance (WCDI)\n\n2024-11-22\n\nEnhancements to the Test Settings Table\n\nWe’re excited to introduce some long-awaited quality of life improvements to the Test Settings Table, designed to enhance your experience and provide a more comprehensive overview of your test settings.\n\nWhat's New:\n\nClearer Labels Column: Quickly identify and manage tests with a new column that clearly lists labels, allowing you to view multiple labels at once.\n\nTest Status Column: Easily see the status of each test and check if data is visible in Views, all at a glance.\n\nCustomizable Columns: Tailor the table to your needs by adding columns for metadata like modified date, alerts, status, interval, agents, type, and monitor.\n\nImproved Filter Accessibility: Access commonly used filters—agents, test labels, and test type—directly from the main chip menu for quicker, more intuitive filtering.\n\nMore Streamlined ServiceNow Incident Management Integration\n\nThe ServiceNow incident management integration now supports the global system property state parameter. This enhancement eliminates the need for customers to disable this parameter in ServiceNow when configuring the integration with ThousandEyes.\n\nSee Incident Management for integration instructions.\n\nSidebar Interaction Changes\n\nWe have updated a few interactions in our left hand navigation to better align to Cisco standards. The new interaction creates a more consistent flyout behavior and removes the ability for the left hand navigation to expand vertically.\n\nShow a Helpful Empty Onboarding State When There Are No Templates Available\n\nWhen a new user only has access to templates created by their organization and no templates are available to them, the onboarding experience now shows a more helpful message.\n\nWe have improved the zoom functionality in map widgets to automatically adjust to the maximum zoom level required to display all data points, ensuring optimal clarity and enhanced visibility.\n\nWe have improved the drilldown tooltip functionality by aggregating all \"no data\" items into a single entry when there are more than 20 items in the tooltip and multiple \"no data\" entries. This enhancement streamlines the tooltip for better readability and usability.\n\n2024-11-22 Bug Fixes\n\nFixed an issue where Templates responses were including internal API references rather than external ones.\n\nNew Cloud Agents\n\nNew Cloud Agents have been added in the locations listed below. For a full list of Cloud Agents, see ThousandEyes Cloud Agent Locations.\n\nAccra, Ghana\n\nAccra, Ghana (IPv6)\n\nAlbuquerque, NM, USA (IPv6)\n\nAmman, Jordan (JTG)\n\nAmman, Jordan (JTG) (IPv6)\n\nBerlin, Germany (Deutsche Telecom)\n\nBerlin, Germany (Deutsche Telecom) (IPv6)\n\nCaracas, Venezuela (Movistar)\n\nFortaleza, Brazil (Vivo)\n\nFortaleza, Brazil (Vivo) (IPv6)\n\nMedellin, Colombia (Telefónica)\n\nMedellin, Colombia (Telefónica) (IPv6)\n\n2024-11-14\n\nEndpoint Agent Client Version 1.219.4\n\nThe following enhancements have been made to the Endpoint Agent client:\n\nAll Platforms\n\nFixed a regression that resulted in test jitter not being correctly applied for scheduled tests with test intervals of 2-10 minutes. This would cause agents to synchronize and test at the same time. For example, 12:00, 12:05, 12:10, and so on, rather than being uniformly spread over the test interval.\n\nWAN Insights Bandwidth-Aware Recommendations\n\nWAN Insights recommendations now consider available capacity when generating recommendations for path changes so only feasible changes are produced making it easier than ever to implement the recommendation. See Recommendation Cards, Explained and the Bandwidth-Aware Recommendations section on Understanding Recommendations for more information. If bandwidth information is not available, the user is guided to enter it as described on Enter or Upload Bandwidth Data.\n\nThousandEyes Endpoint Agent Support for ARM-based Windows and macOS Platforms\n\nThousandEyes Endpoint Agent now supports ARM-based Windows through emulation and macOS natively, ensuring functionality is seamless, similar to x86 architecture. The key experiences for you remain unchanged. Just as users can download, package, and use the Endpoint Agent for x86, the same applies to ARM. This ensures a consistent and efficient experience across different architectures.\n\nKey Features:\n\nOut-of-the-Box Functionality: The agent is designed to work out of the box with the latest version of the agent. In the ThousandEyes web application, navigate to Endpoint Agents -> Agent Settings to download the installer. You can learn more about the system requirements here.\n\nGoogle Chrome Extension: The Endpoint agent Google Chrome Extension version 1.215.0 is available in the Chrome Store for Mac package and existing Windows packages running on Windows ARM (via emulation). This extension will enable users to perform Real User Tests.\n\nPresently, native support for Windows devices is not available. However, we are aiming to include this support in future releases.\n\n2024-11-13\n\nAnnouncing BGP Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Monitoring\n\nWe are excited to announce the new RPKI status in the BGP route visualization view and alert condition, which informs you about BGP announcements with specific RPKI statuses detected by our BGP monitors.\n\nKey Features:\n\nAlert Configuration: You can now configure alerts using the new RPKI Status alert condition\n\nCustom Monitoring: Associate these alerts with specific tests or prefixes you wish to monitor\n\nWhen the ThousandEyes BGP platform detects a BGP announcement with the RPKI status you have configured, or the RPKI status of existing BGP announcements changes to the alertable value, you can receive an alert by adding the RPKI status condition in your BGP alert rule. Additionally, the BGP path visualization shows which Autonomous System (AS) is announcing an RPKI Invalid prefix. You can also filter the BGP path visualization by any RPKI status and see the affected routes.\n\nFor more information, see RPKI.\n\n2024-11-11\n\nIPv6 Support for Endpoint Agent\n\nThe Endpoint Agent now functions in a dual-stack environment, enabling deterministic testing between IPv4 and IPv6. This support is provided for ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent versions 1.219.1 and above, and the Endpoint Agent Google Chrome Extension version 1.215.0 and above via autodetect only.\n\nICMP/IPv6 Support: Available for Scheduled Tests (HTTP and Network) and Dynamic Tests.\n\nCurrently, IPv6 for TCP is not supported. We will aim to implement support for IPv6 for TCP in future releases, after which it can be extended to all protocols, including AutoDetect. This would also enable support for Local Networks and Browser Tests (Real User Tests), which rely on auto-detect. You can learn more about configuring these settings here.\n\n2024-11-08\n\nRemoved ISR1100X-4G from the Support Matrix\n\nISR1100X-4G has been removed from the list of supported Cisco devices for Enterprise Agents in the product documentation support matrix: Cisco Devices Support Matrix.\n\nThe ISR1100X-4G was added to the documentation in error in advance of final validation. It has since been discovered that it is not possible for us to support the Enterprise Agent on this device. At this time, it is not expected that this model will be brought into support.\n\nOpenTelemetry Trace Signal for Page Load and Web Transaction Tests\n\nAdded support for the OpenTelemetry trace signal for page load and web transaction tests. This enhancement provides deeper visibility into application performance.\n\n2024-11-01\n\nEndpoint Agent Client Version 1.219.1\n\nThe following enhancements have been made to the Endpoint Agent client:\n\nAll Platforms\n\nPreviously, the agent would not correctly respect HTTP tests that had requested IPv6-only results for name resolution. This issue has now been resolved.\n\nThe agent now attempts to call the new unregister API -endpoint when an account change occurs, allowing the system to free up the license, if applicable, improving the account change workflow.\n\nThe agent now registers itself from a file containing relevant information, thereby enhancing provisioning workflows in the future.\n\nWindows\n\nPreviously, there were instances where local user accounts linked to a specific agent were registered multiple times, resulting in duplicates appearing on the Agent Settings page. This issue has now been resolved. However, the existing duplicated user accounts are still visible on the Agent Settings page. We plan to address this in a future update.\n\nThe Chrome and Edge extensions are now compatible with the ThousandEyes agent running on the Windows arm64 operating system through x64 emulation.\n\nTesting of ingress and service for scheduled tests using Cisco Secure Access (CSA) ZTA is now supported.\n\nmacOS\n\nPreviously, there were instances where local user accounts linked to a specific agent were registered multiple times, resulting in duplicates appearing on the Agent Settings page. This issue has now been resolved. However, the existing duplicated user accounts are still visible on the Agent Settings page. We plan to address this in a future update.\n\nTesting of ingress and service for scheduled tests using Cisco Secure Access (CSA) ZTA is now supported.\n\narm64 native packages are now available on the ThousandEyes platform.\n\n2024-10-31\n\nEnhanced Network Outage Detection Algorithm\n\nWe’ve improved the accuracy of our network outage detection algorithm. These enhancements allow us to more precisely detect network outages and attribute them to their source Autonomous System Number (ASN).\n\n2024-10-29\n\nTemplates: BGP Prefixes Are Now Supported in Global Settings\n\nWhen using templates to set up tests that support BGP, you can now specify one or more prefixes, just as you can in basic test configuration. For more information about setting up BGP tests, see BGP Tests.\n\n2024-10-29 Bug Fixes\n\nFixed a height issue for template details.\n\nRemove properties with invalid null values in the preset templates.\n\n2024-10-24\n\nEnterprise Agent Appliance Backup/Restore and Automatic Upgrades\n\nWe have released two capabilities today for Enterprise Agent appliances (the ThousandEyes Virtual Appliance (TEVA) and ThousandEyes Physical Appliance (TEPA) for the NUC and Raspberry Pi 4). You can now perform a backup of the configuration and agent identity on your appliances to a file that can be downloaded and retained for later restoration. You can also now perform a restore during the initial setup process to bring over a complete configuration, including agent identity. This backup and restore process was added into the product to simplify recovery if you encounter any issues.\n\nAdditionally, we have added an updated version of our automatic upgrade process which will allow you to perform an in-place upgrade from the base OS of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (\"Focal\") to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (\"Jammy\"). As we complete the release of new versions of all of our install types we will provide further communication in the future notify customers to begin upgrades, however this feature makes upgrades available today for customers using the TEVA and TEPA.\n\nEndpoint Agent Views 2.0: The New Default View\n\nThe new Endpoint Agent Views 2.0 will become the default view for all users starting October 26, 2024. You can switch back to the old version, Endpoint Agent Views 1.0, using the toggle in the user interface.\n\nYou can provide feedback about the Endpoint Agent Views 2.0 through the new Submit Feedback button in the top right corner of the user interface.\n\nPlease note that Endpoint Agent Views 1.0 will no longer be available after January, 2025. From that point on, only Endpoint Agent Views 2.0 will be accessible.\n\n2024-10-24 Bug Fixes\n\nView-only users can now browse and view templates, but they cannot create, update, delete, or deploy templates.\n\nResolved an issue where alert rules with adaptive configurations were not being saved correctly, causing the rules to default to manual configuration.\n\n2024-10-18\n\n2024-10-18 Bug Fixes\n\nFixed an issue with text wrap in the template detail displayed in the side bar.\n\nTemplates now render the test name correctly when the template form is first displayed.\n\nFix an issue in template creation status page where buttons weren't visible without scrolling down.\n\nCorrected the placement of the error notification in template creation flow.\n\n2024-10-15\n\nUnified Test Creation is Enabled for All Accounts\n\nUnified Test Creation workflow is now enabled for all accounts, as announced earlier. You can still switch back to the original test creation experience by clicking on the “Switch to Classic Test Creation” button. After January 17th, the classic test creation workflow will be deprecated and we will remove the option to switch back to it. To learn more about this improved workflow, see Templates: Start Monitoring.\n\n2024-10-14\n\nAnnouncing Test Optimizations\n\nTest optimizations are helpful recommendations to improve your existing tests. For this release, we’re analyzing your existing tests and will notify you if we notice an error in your proxy test settings. This common error occurs when tests are configured with an HTTP Proxy in place without using the \"Perform network measurements to the proxy\" setting. Many customers enable proxy settings on a per-agent basis and often forget to check this option to monitor the network to the proxy. As a result, data for the test will not be gathered for the network layer, leaving an unexpected gap in coverage.\n\nIf you have tests in this state, you will be notified and asked via callouts in the UI for permission to fix this error. Once you grant permission, we will automatically select the “Perform network measurements to the proxy” checkbox for the provided list of identified problematic tests. This solves the issue for the blank network layer in test views. Please note that this change will increase the network traffic to your proxy.\n\nFor more information on why you should select \"Perform network measurements to the proxy\" see Proxy Metrics. For more information about the proxy settings test optimization, see Test Configuration Optimizations.\n\n2024-10-10\n\nAnnouncing Azure Path Enrichment\n\nWe’ve expanded our cloud visibility by adding Azure Path Enrichment, building on existing AWS and GCP capabilities. Azure nodes with public IPs are now tagged and include region details in the path visualization, enhancing multi-cloud network insights. Service identification is planned for future updates. For more information, see Using the Path Visualization View: Supported Cloud Providers.\n\nNew Self-Service Internet Insights Trial for Existing Users\n\nExisting users can now request a free, 30-day trial of Internet Insights directly within the ThousandEyes portal. To begin, navigate to Internet Insights from the left-hand menu. In the limited outage map view, click Request Trial from the available call-to-action to activate your free trial.\n\n2024-10-09\n\nViews 1.0 Removed from ThousandEyes Platform\n\nAs of today, Views 1.0 is no longer available on the ThousandEyes platform. Users will now be directed to the new Views 2.0 experience for all test types, including voice (RTP and SIP), DNSSEC, DNS trace, and FTP tests, which are fully supported.\n\nThis change marks the final phase of our transition to Views 2.0, bringing improved performance, better visualization, and a more streamlined user interface.\n\nBrowserBot v3.0.0 Agent Architecture\n\nBrowserBot v3.0.0 on the Enterprise Agent has migrated to a new agent architecture that offers more control over the agent containers that run each instance of a page load, transaction or API test. The upgrade should be transparent to users and will have minimal impact to existing page load, transaction or API tests.\n\nIPv6 Network Tests over ICMP for Endpoint Agents\n\nThousandEyes now supports IPv6 network tests over ICMP for Endpoint Agents. Any existing ICMP tests will use \"IPv4 only\" by default and can switch to \"Prefer IPv6\" or \"Force IPv6\".\n\n2024-10-09 Bug Fixes\n\nFixed an issue where users couldn't run an instant test if they didn't close the welcome banner.\n\nResolved an issue in the dashboard filter where the Endpoint Agent test name filter was not applying correctly.\n\n2024-10-08\n\nWAN Insights Alerting\n\nThousandEyes now supports alerting for WAN Insights metrics such as capacity and site quality. To learn more, refer to the documentation pages at WAN Insights and ThousandEyes Alerts.\n\n2024-10-08 Bug Fixes\n\nImproved the error message users receive when trying to create a template with no tests in it.\n\nThe Endpoint template review step now says “…monitor your application” instead of “…deploy your application”.\n\n2024-10-07\n\nImpact of Win11 24H2 on Endpoint Agent's Wi-Fi Reporting\n\nWith the recent Windows 11 version 24H2 release, if Start > Settings > Privacy > Location is set to Off, the Endpoint Agent will no longer be able to report SSID, BSSID, or wireless signal quality information for the currently associated Wi-Fi access point. This change stems from updated security privacy requirements in Windows, which require users to enable location services.\n\nThis change has the following impacts:\n\nIn the path trace visualization, the wireless node is not displayed.\n\nDetails of BSSID, SSID, and signal quality are no longer available.\n\nNo data is displayed under Agent Views > Wireless.\n\nInformation about neighboring access points is not accessible.\n\nIn the segment visualization, connection status is displayed as unknown.\n\nTo ensure you get the best experience with our product, we recommend that your administrators enable location services by default for your organization's endpoints.\n\n2024-10-04\n\nSamKnows Data Migration Announcement\n\nAs we continue to integrate SamKnows into Cisco ThousandEyes, over the coming months we will deliver a number of data and customer migration activities. These activities will not interrupt any services the platforms provide, but you may start to see some small changes, and some of these changes may require you to take action. We detail these below.\n\nData and customer migration will occur in two phases.\n\nPhase 1 - Migration of Database and Infrastructure\n\nBy December 2024, we aim to migrate all SamKnows databases and infrastructure from Google GCP to Amazon AWS (Frankfurt). These migrations will be staggered, with a small percentage of traffic being moved at each step.\n\nThere will be no changes to how you access SamKnows One (https://samknows.one) in this phase. However, you may need to take action on the following points:\n\nThe IP addresses of our API endpoints will change.\n\nAs part of the move to AWS, SamKnows API endpoints will move to new IP addresses provided by AWS. We are not changing the hostnames of our API endpoints, so if you only rely on the hostnames then these changes will be completely transparent to you.\n\nWhile we advise customers to avoid hard-coding IP addresses, we are aware that some customers may have done so in order to satisfy their own security requirements (e.g., configuring an outbound IP ACL). If IP addresses have been hard-coded, then once we switch IP addresses, you may have issues accessing SamKnows APIs.\n\nIf you are unsure whether your SamKnows IP addresses have been hard-coded, we recommend checking with your network and security teams in advance.\n\nIf IP hard-coding is unavoidable for your organization, find below a table of the current and new IP addresses.\n\nSome automated emails will start to be sent from the thousandeyes.com domain\n\nSamKnows One sends some automated emails to customers. For example, large data exports may be generated asynchronously and you will receive a link via email. Currently, these emails all originate from a samknows.com email address. Starting 4 November 2024, these emails will begin to originate from a thousandeyes.com email address.\n\nIf your email system has any allowlist for samknows.com, then you should also add thousandeyes.com to this allowlist by 4 November to ensure you continue to receive these automated emails.\n\nThousandEyes will start to be referenced inside samknows.one\n\nSome of the API documentation and endpoints will migrate from the API reference on samknows.one to the API reference on Cisco Devnet, where ThousandEyes APIs are referenced. There is no technical change here; the existing endpoints will continue to function as before.\n\nPhase 2 - Migration of Customers from samknows.one to app.thousandeyes.com\n\nBeginning in January 2025, once Phase 1 has completed, we will hard-switch SamKnows One over to the ThousandEyes platform. At this point:\n\nYou will be redirected to https://app.thousandeyes.com if you visit SamKnows One. When logging into https://app.thousandeyes.com for the first time, you will be prompted to reset your password.\n\nYou will find the SamKnows product suite under the Connected Devices menu item within the ThousandEyes platform.\n\nWe will continue to update the changelog and communicate with you via email during this transition to remind you of the changes, and inform you of specific dates by when certain actions need to be taken to avoid losing access to your SamKnows resources.\n\n2024-10-03\n\nTemplates Can Now Be Grouped\n\nTest templates can now be grouped using the Templates API. This offers an additional layer of organization allowing you to view sub-sections within templates, and turn off individual tests as well as intra-template groups, all in the sidebar. For more details, see the Templates API Reference.\n\n2024-10-03 Bug Fixes\n\nFixed an issue where non-square icons rendered strangely for collections.\n\n2024-10-02\n\nIntroducing Adaptive Alert Detection\n\nWe are pleased to announce adaptive alert detection, a powerful enhancement to our alerting system that is now available to all customers. Adaptive alert detection better distinguishes genuine issues from potential alert noise for faster incident resolution. This makes it easier for users to maintain optimal network performance with minimal effort.\n\nKey Features and Enhancements:\n\nIntelligent alerting: adaptive alert detection leverages a sophisticated algorithm (patent pending) to deliver more accurate, context-aware alerts that adjust dynamically to real-time network conditions.\n\nMinimal configuration: default settings provide value right out of the box with automatic aggregation, minimizing the need for setup or fine-tuning.\n\nReduced false positives: smarter detection reduces multiple alerts for the same issue (flappy alerts), reducing false positives, and ensuring alerts are more meaningful.\n\nCustomizable sensitivity: teams can adjust alert sensitivity (high, medium, low) to receive more or fewer alerts to suit their specific environment needs.\n\nAdaptive alert detection is currently available for Cloud and Enterprise Agent alerts. It is the default alerting method for all new alerts for these agents. You can edit new and old alerts alike to use the manual or adaptive method.\n\nSee Adaptive Alert Detection for more information.\n\n2024-10-01\n\nFinal Reminder to Transition to Views 2.0\n\nViews 1.0 will now be removed from the ThousandEyes platform after October 8th, 2024. We encourage all users to finalize their transition to Views 2.0 as soon as possible in preparation for this change.\n\nWe appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this transition. Please reach out if you experience any issues or have concerns regarding this change. Our goal is to ensure a smooth and seamless experience for all users.\n\n2024-09-26\n\nIntroducing Endpoint Agent Views 2.0\n\nWe are pleased to announce Endpoint Agent Views 2.0, an upgrade designed to streamline troubleshooting and enhance the user experience. From help desk technicians to network engineers, this new view allows everyone to access comprehensive information related to a specific agent, enabling efficient resolution of end-user issues.\n\nKey Features and Enhancements:\n\nSegmented Visualization: Quickly identify where the problem lies by segmenting the end-to-end path based on its owner, helping technicians to quickly locate, escalate and resolve problems.\n\nSegment Scores: Provides a simplified view of network health, allowing users to assess the impact of issues at a glance.\n\nPer-Process Information: Offers detailed insights into CPU and memory usage by specific applications and processes, enabling targeted action to resolve performance issues.\n\nThis new version is available for all users in a limited preview and is labeled as Endpoint Agent Views 2.0. The existing version is labeled as Endpoint Agent Views 1.0, and users can toggle between the two versions.\n\nSee Endpoint Agent Views 2.0 for more information.\n\nPAC files are cached for a limited time, and reloaded on a five minute interval.\n\nIf the PAC file is updated with invalid content, the Enterprise Agent may fail (even if it was previously working). In this case, the agent will continue to fail until the PAC file error is corrected and the agent reloads the valid file.\n\nSAML-JIT Provisioning for ThousandEyes\n\nWe are pleased to announce the release of SAML just-in-time (JIT) provisioning for ThousandEyes. This feature allows for on-the-spot user creation and authentication using SAML, streamlining user management and ensuring up-to-date records. For detailed setup instructions and more information, please refer to the SAML JIT provisioning documentation.\n\nEnterprise Agent Public IP Address TTL Set to 30 Minutes\n\nAs previously announced, we have changed how ThousandEyes Enterprise Agents update their associated public IP addresses to avoid IP flapping. Agents now only update the public IP address of the agent when the prefix length differs, or after a platform-configured time-to-live (TTL) value elapses.\n\nThe TTL value is now set to 30 minutes.\n\n2024-09-25\n\nCloud Insights Limited Preview\n\nCloud Insights offers new capabilities for monitoring and troubleshooting cloud native and hybrid cloud environments. These new capabilities include:\n\nExtending test path visualization with display of the discovered cloud network topology.\n\nTracking cloud network configuration changes correlated with performance and availability measurements.\n\nVisualizing cloud traffic flow information over time. Cloud Insights currently supports AWS hosted applications and is available for evaluation until December 2024. For more details, please see Cloud Insights.\n\n2024-09-18\n\nAlpine Linux 3.20 Images Now Available\n\nWe have now released updated Docker for Linux container images that are based on Alpine 3.20. Moving forward, all container-based installation types for the ThousandEyes Enterprise Agent will be built against an Alpine base instead of an Ubuntu base. This conveys numerous advantages for customers, primarily due to the reduced size of the base image, which improves the performance of installation and upgrades, reduces the security footprint, and enables us to improve velocity for our engineering teams.\n\nThis has no impact on existing installs. New installations with the updated images will have the new base.\n\nConfigure Splunk HEC Exporter in ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry\n\nYou can now configure the following fields in the Splunk HEC exporter stream: token, source, sourceType, and index. For more details, visit the Splunk integration guide.\n\nWith the new capability to configure the Splunk HEC index, you can choose whether to export ThousandEyes telemetry data as events or metrics to Splunk. Learn more here.\n\nAdditionally, setting the Splunk HEC token in customerHeaders[\"token\"] is now deprecated. The token should be specified in exporterConfig.SplunkHec.token going forward. This functionality will be removed in 3 months.\n\n2024-09-18 Bug Fixes\n\nAn issue that was incorrectly showing interface metrics data in the Endpoint Agent view has been resolved. In particular, due to a misalignment in the data, sometimes we were showing data even when the agent was offline. The problem has been addressed, and now the data is properly shown.\n\nAn issue that was incorrectly associating Endpoint Agents with Endpoint labels when the submission of the agent data was delayed (e.g., agent loses connectivity to the Internet) has been resolved.\n\n2024-09-05\n\nAdd \"optional\" Field to the UserInput Model in Templates\n\nA new boolean field named “optional” has been added to the UserInput model to mark a given user input as optional. You can now create or edit a template with optional user inputs.\n\nSupport for Monitoring OpenAI\n\nTests in a template can now target the OpenAI API (api.openai.com). If the consumer of a template has an OpenAI API key, they can provide that as a user input, which can be used in the template for the API tests. However, the field is optional and is not required for deploying the template.\n\nEndpoint Agent Client Version 1.206.0\n\nThe following enhancements have been made to the Endpoint Agent client:\n\nAll Platforms\n\nPreviously, the agent only considered ICMP-based protocols for testing the AnyConnect underlay when the VPN used IPSEC-based connections. The agent will now consider TCP tests for such cases.\n\nThe compatibility of the Endpoint Agent Internet Explorer plug-in is improved when used with other third-party Internet Explorer plug-ins that use a different version of the Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime.\n\nThe agent has been updated to continue supporting the integration of Webex Control Hub with the latest Webex client release.\n\nAn issue has been resolved where the agent did not correctly consider the Zscaler PAC file and did not correctly identify bypassed targets.\n\nPreviously, when the agent conducted Webex calling dynamic tests, it could potentially use a different interface than the originally detected network flow. This has now been corrected, and the agent will consistently use the same interface for testing.\n\nImproved error reporting has been implemented for scheduled tests that target an HTTPS server via a proxy. If the proxy returns an HTTP error code, it is now reported as an \"HTTP\" error instead of a \"Receive\" error. Additionally, the HTTP error code reported by the proxy, along with the request and response headers, are now accessible for inspection.\n\n2024-09-05 Bug Fixes\n\nFixed an issue where the step indicator caused an unexpected scroll behavior by pushing the navigation buttons.\n\n2024-09-04\n\nAs previously announced in the August 1st, 2024 changelog, we have updated the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols and cipher suites for all ThousandEyes services.\n\nThe following changes are now in effect for all ThousandEyes services:\n\nAdded support for TLS 1.3 protocols, enabling more secure and efficient cryptographic handshakes.\n\nAll Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) ciphers from the TLS 1.2 suite will be removed due to their susceptibility to specific vulnerabilities.\n\nUpdated supported Cipher Suites:\n\nTLS 1.2: ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256, ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, and ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305.\n\nTLS 1.3: TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, and TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256.\n\nThis update ensures compliance with the latest security standards and best practices, reducing the risk of exposure to known vulnerabilities associated with CBC ciphers. Clients and integrations must support the aforementioned cipher suites to maintain compatibility with our application.\n\nEnterprise Agent Public IP Address Behavior Change\n\nPreviously, ThousandEyes Enterprise Agents have updated their associated public IP address on every check-in. However, this can cause the agent's IP to flap in some situations, so we have made a change to only update the public IP address of the agent when the prefix length differs or after a platform-configured time-to-live (TTL) value elapses.\n\nSendGrid Email-to-SMS Disabled\n\nDue to recent SendGrid policy changes, SendGrid no longer supports relaying messages to email-to-SMS addresses (for example, 1234567890@tmomail.net). This change affects customers who use this method for alert notifications.\n\nTo ensure uninterrupted alert delivery, we recommend you explore alternative notification channels while we work on finding new options to support SMS notifications.\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry Introduces Data Model v2\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry now supports data model v2. As part of this update, ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry now uses data model v2 as the default version. Both data model v1 and data model v2 remain available for use. For more details, refer to the ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry Data Model documentation.\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry Data Model Now Streams the test.name Attribute for Endpoint Tests\n\nThe test.name metric attribute is now included in OpenTelemetry streams for all ThousandEyes tests, including Endpoint Agent tests. Previously, this attribute was only available for Cloud and Enterprise Agent tests. For more information, see ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry Metrics.\n\n2024-09-03\n\nThousandEyes Physical and Virtual Appliances Now Run on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS\n\nThe base operating system for our ThousandEyes Physical Appliance (TEPA) images for Intel / ASUS NUCs and Raspberry Pi 4s, as well as our ThousandEyes Virtual Appliance (TEVA) images for VMware ESXi, VirtualBox, and Hyper-V, has been switched to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.\n\nWith this change, we've also updated the appliance customization in the Add Agents dialog to produce images with an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS base.\n\nThis has no impact on existing installations. All new installations with the updated images will have the new base operating system.\n\n2024-08-28\n\nMulti-Factor Authentication for User API Tokens\n\nSecurity is at the core of ThousandEyes values, and with the latest updates, we are introducing a significant enhancement to the security of user API tokens. Now, whenever a user needs to create, remove, or regenerate basic tokens or OAuth bearer tokens, they will need to enter the multi-factor authentication (MFA) code sent to their user email.\n\nFor more details, see User API Token.\n\nJava SDK v1.0.0\n\nThe Java API SDK v1.0.0 has been published and is now available to all customers. You can access these resources through the Maven Central portal. You can also access and contribute to our public GitHub repo.\n\nTo install a package from the SDK:\n\nFixed Values for BSSID and SSID in the UI for macOS 14.6\n\nAs reported earlier, we have implemented an interim solution to substitute the all-zero BSSID string and Unicode characters replacing SSID in reports by a fixed value in the format - Unknown SSID - Agent name/ Unknown BSSID -Agent name\n\n2024-08-28 Bug Fixes\n\nAn issue was found where classic webhook integrations were missing from the Notifications tab on the Endpoint Alert Rules page. This has been resolved.\n\n2024-08-21\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry Data Model Now Streams the test.name Attribute\n\nFor Cloud and Enterprise Agent tests, the test name is now included as the metric attribute test.name, exported using ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry. For more information, see ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry Metrics.\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry BGP Metrics Are Now Event-Driven\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry BGP metrics are now event-driven, which means that they will only be streamed when there is an update in the monitored prefixes. For more information, see ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry.\n\n2024-08-15\n\nRecommendations and Templates Now Appear Together on One Page\n\nPreviously when you selected Start Monitoring, recommendations and templates were shown separately. Now they are shown side by side for more convenience and improved usability.\n\nIntroducing the Unified Test Creation Workflow\n\nTo streamline the test-creation experience, we are continuing our rollout of the unified test creation workflow that began on June 20th. From the Test Settings screen, you can click Start Monitoring to begin your monitoring journey. This allows you to create a single test; or deploy from the test recommendations or built-in or user-defined templates.\n\nTo switch back to the original test creation UI, click Switch to Classic test creation. You can also create single test from the + button. For more information, see Templates: Select a Template via Start Monitoring.\n\nIntroducing ThousandEyes Connected Devices\n\nWe are excited to announce the general availability of our new Connected Devices suite of products and functionality. Known previously to many as SamKnows, this internet performance monitoring platform has taken up residence in ThousandEyes and is rebranded as Connected Devices.\n\nFitting squarely within ThousandEyes’ agent and test infrastructure, Connected Devices measures the crucial \"last mile\" of internet performance via new Device Agents and a host of new tests. The Device Agents live on routers and within mobile apps to enable network visibility down to the personal device level. The new range of tests allows measurements to be taken across all ThousandEyes test layers. In addition, the agents can simulate tests to real applications such as games, social media sites, and video conferencing services, for accurate quality-of-experience measurements against tools and services that end users really care about.\n\nConnected Devices also brings us Cisco Real Speed, a two-step speed test triggered from both the router and the personal device in real time that can help users and their broadband providers alike determine whether the cause of an issue is rooted inside the home or without – a serious new ally in addressing the age-old question of “is the problem inside or outside my home?”\n\nNote that test results are viewed from a new user interface on the ThousandEyes platform specially built for Connected Devices customers – they are not currently viewable on ThousandEyes Views screens.\n\nRead more about the many capabilities of Connected Devices, and how to view and analyze your test results, at Connected Devices.\n\nEach Device Agent requires a license. Some tests also require the purchase of units. Speak to your account manager about purchase options, and learn more about the pricing model at Device Agent Consumption Model.\n\nMap View Adjustment for Browser Tests\n\nThe map component in Views 2.0 has been rearranged so that Unique Agent Stats or the Agent Identifier is at the bottom of the map section. Duplicate and extraneous information in the Map section of page load and transaction tests has been removed.\n\nImpact of macOS 14.6 on Endpoint Agent's Wi-Fi Reporting\n\nWith the recent macOS 14.6 point release, the Cisco ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent can no longer report SSID or BSSID information for the currently associated Wi-Fi access point. This change stems from updated security privacy requirements in macOS, which require user consent to enable Location Services and opt-in to share location data with each application.\n\nThis change impacts:\n\nUser Interface:\n\nThe SSID and BSSID values are now displayed as an all-zero BSSID string and Unicode characters replacing SSID in reports.\n\nSSID is no longer populated in tables.\n\nThe Wireless Info section no longer displays SSID/BSSID details.\n\nThe Connection segment no longer shows SSID/BSSID information.\n\nAgents without SSID information will be grouped within Path Visualization.\n\nAgent Labels: Labels based on SSID/BSSID are no longer functional.\n\nData Tagging: Datapoints are not tagged correctly, affecting filtering.\n\nTest Assignments: Test assignments that rely on these labels are non-functional.\n\nWi-Fi Monitoring: Monitoring for Wi-Fi change events (e.g., channel swaps) may also be disrupted.\n\nWe're working on an interim solution to address the UI issues by the end of August, 2024, and will let you know about any further updates.\n\n2024-08-14\n\nProxy Settings Available for API Test Type\n\nProxy Metrics are now available for the API test type. Proxy settings were previously available for HTTP server, page load, and transaction tests.\n\nConfigure these settings in Cloud & Enterprise Agents > Test Settings under the Advanced Settings tab. When Perform network measurements to the proxy is checked, the Agent to Server layer in the API test type view shows proxy details, which appear as another node, as well as network layer metrics such as proxy loss, latency, and jitter.\n\nEndpoint Agent Client Version 1.203.4\n\nThe following enhancements have been made to the Endpoint Agent client:\n\nRoomOS\n\nThe agent has been updated to ensure ongoing support for the integration of Webex Control Hub with the latest release of the Webex client.\n\n2024-08-08\n\nEndpoint Agent Client Version 1.203.2\n\nThe following enhancements have been made to the Endpoint Agent client:\n\nAll Platforms\n\nFixed an issue where the agent ran dynamic tests for Webex Calling on a different interface than the originally detected network flow.\n\nFixed an issue with the network probes that prevented the agents from reporting system metrics such as CPU/Memory, Signal Quality, and Link Speed.\n\nPreviously, when auto-detect found that no modes were suitable for testing the target, it would return an incorrect probe mode. This has now been fixed to report the original mode if no testing is performed.\n\nThe agents' path tracing is improved when using a VPN.\n\nThe robustness of auto protocol detection is enhanced to counter frequently occurring network changes.\n\nThe agent will enforce a maximum database size for both, the system and the user agent.\n\nWindows\n\nThe unapproved NPCAP versions can be used by default to run te-diagnostics network tests.\n\nThe agent updates will continue to work even if the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is disabled.\n\nPreviously, when a user selected version 1.00 of NPCAP as an allowed NPCAP version, the agent would not support it. This has now been resolved, and the agent supports version 1.00 of NPCAP.\n\nRoomOS\n\nFixed an issue where an unresponsive DNS server could lead to increased memory usage.\n\n2024-08-07\n\nUpcoming Transition to Views 2.0\n\nWe are excited to announce that Voice (RTP and SIP), DNSSEC, DNS trace, and FTP tests are now fully supported for Views 2.0. With these final test types supported, we will be making changes to how users interact with test views on our platform:\n\nAt the end of August, 2024, the option to set Views 1.0 as the default preference will be removed. All tests will be presented in Views 2.0 by default.\n\nUsers will still have the ability to manually click \"Open Views 1.0\" to view a test until October 1st, 2024. However, this change will only apply to the selected test during the active browser session.\n\nOn October 1st, 2024, Views 1.0 will be removed from the ThousandEyes platform. After this date, the \"Open Views 1.0\" option will not be available, and all tests will exclusively use Views 2.0.\n\nWe appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this transition. Please reach out if you experience any issues or have concerns regarding this change. Our goal is to ensure a smooth and seamless experience for all users.\n\n2024-08-05\n\nEnd of Support for Skype for Business\n\nWe are deprecating support for Skype for Business, as the upstream service has now been deprecated by Microsoft. The functionality will be removed from all voice tests within ThousandEyes on November 5th, 2024.\n\n2024-08-01\n\nIn our ongoing efforts to maintain the highest security standards, we are updating the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols and cipher suites for all ThousandEyes services.\n\nAfter September 2nd, 2024, the following changes will be in effect for all ThousandEyes services:\n\nAdded support for TLS 1.3 protocols, enabling more secure and efficient cryptographic handshakes.\n\nAll Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) ciphers from the TLS 1.2 suite will be deprecated due to their susceptibility to specific vulnerabilities.\n\nUpdated supported Cipher Suites:\n\nTLS 1.2: ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256, ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, and ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305.\n\nTLS 1.3: TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, and TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256.\n\nThis update ensures compliance with the latest security standards and best practices, reducing the risk of exposure to known vulnerabilities associated with CBC ciphers. Clients and integrations must support the aforementioned cipher suites to maintain compatibility with our application.\n\nWe encourage all users to verify their systems' compatibility and make any necessary adjustments to continue enjoying secure communications with our application.\n\nTo improve the explainability of the widget for executives and team members, you can now save a description for any dashboard widget in ThousandEyes. Select Widget Settings add a description, and then save it.\n\nPython API SDK Release\n\nThe Python API SDK has been published and is now available to all customers, and you can access resources through PyPi. You can also access and contribute to our public GitHub repo. Installing a package from the SDK is as simple as running pip install thousandeyes-sdk-usage.\n\nNew Cloud Agents\n\nNew Cloud Agents have been added in the locations listed below. For a full list of Cloud Agents, see ThousandEyes Cloud Agent Locations.\n\nBarcelona, Spain (Vodafone)\n\nBarcelona, Spain (Vodafone) (IPv6)\n\nBelo Horizonte, Brazil (Vivo)\n\nBelo Horizonte, Brazil (Vivo) (IPv6)\n\nBerlin, Germany (Vodafone)\n\nBerlin, Germany (Vodafone) (IPv6)\n\nFrankfurt, Germany (Deutsche Telecom)\n\nFrankfurt, Germany (Deutsche Telecom) (IPv6)\n\nSantiago, Chile (Movistar)\n\nSantiago, Chile (Movistar) (IPv6)\n\nNew Azure Data Center Cloud Agents\n\nQuerétaro, Mexico (Mexico Central)\n\n2024-08-01 Bug Fixes\n\nAn issue that was not correctly applying the highlighting filtering in the Network Topology section of the Endpoint Views page has been resolved. The filtering is now correctly applied in the path view, and the nodes are properly highlighted when matching the condition.\n\nAn issue that was not correctly propagating the version 1.00 of the NPCAP library has been fixed. The Advanced Agent Settings tab for Endpoint Agent settings now includes the ability to define the allowed NPCAP versions for Endpoint Agents.\n\n2024-07-22\n\nDashboard Templates for Endpoint Agent\n\nYou can now deploy dashboards using designated templates to monitor the end-user experience, diagnose overall network and application health, and streamline troubleshooting. You can learn more about deploying them in Dashboard Templates.\n\nThis release introduces the following Endpoint Agent dashboard templates:\n\nHome Worker Dashboard\n\nEnd User Helpdesk Dashboard\n\nEnd User Wireless Health Dashboard\n\nEnd User Localized Issues Dashboard\n\nEnd User Health Overview Dashboard\n\nEnd User Office vs Remote Dashboard\n\nEnd User Detailed Wireless Health Dashboard\n\n2024-07-16\n\nTo enhance system performance and streamline management, we have set a limit of 1,000 elements (an element is defined as each option you can add to a filter used to describe the label) for each Endpoint Agent label. This limit can comfortably accommodate the typical use of the Endpoint Agent labels. It will be enforced for all new and modified labels in the future, while pre-existing labels that surpass this threshold will remain unaffected. You can continue to employ and adjust these labels, albeit without the ability to expand the number of elements beyond the current value.\n\n2024-07-08\n\nNear Real-Time BGP Monitoring and Alerting\n\nOur BGP tests and alerting is being upgraded to near real-time, shifting from 15-minute intervals to 1-minute intervals after July 9, 2024, enabling quicker detection and response to BGP issues. Existing alert rules will automatically convert to the new format, with customized configurations now available based on time rather than round-based alerting. Users are advised to review and adjust their alert settings post-transition for optimal monitoring, with the v6 and v7 API endpoints being updated to include a new time field. Correction: Customers will be updated in batches through the end of the month.\n\nPrevious Announcement\n\nCreating and Editing Alert Rules\n\n2024-06-27\n\nNew Makeover for ThousandEyes\n\nAs announced previously, we have updated the ThousandEyes look and feel across our platform to better align with Cisco standards. This change includes redesigning our headers, left-hand navigation, icons, font, and typography, without affecting functionality. These changes will provide our customers with a consistent experience when they switch among Cisco Cloud products, and an improved modern user interface. Learn more about the UI changes from this video tutorial.\n\nEndpoint Agent Client Version 1.200.0\n\nThe following enhancements have been made to the Endpoint Agent client:\n\nAll Platforms\n\nIn certain cases, an issue prevented the Endpoint Agent from collecting local network and device metrics, such as Gateway, DNS, System CPU, and System Memory. The Endpoint Agent now identifies these cases and attempts to work around the issue.\n\nThe memory required for the Endpoint Agent installed on the Linux platform to run the network test has been reduced.\n\nAdditional information is included while reporting the cause of network probe failures to provide more clarity.\n\nPreviously, the agent used to crash when reading certain values from the database. This issue has been fixed.\n\nPreviously, the agent could see a false negative of 100% loss when running HTTP tests, the root cause was that an incorrect port was being discovered. This has now been corrected.\n\nThe diagnostics tool now supports extended UDP STUN testing to targets, aiding in diagnosing issues with the agent.\n\nFixed an issue that caused Real User Tests not to report all pages when a large number of monitored domains were visited simultaneously from a browser with the Endpoint extension installed.\n\nWindows\n\nFixed an issue that prevented the uninstallation of the agent after deployment using an MSI transformation file to apply the account information.\n\nmacOS\n\nThe macOS UI installation process has been enhanced to allow users to add the connection string and other account information post successful agent installation.\n\nPreviously, the agent was capturing and redirecting the stdout and stderr to files, which could under certain conditions grow unbounded. The agent no longer redirects stdout and stderr.\n\n2024-06-25\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry API Now Supports Data Streaming to Splunk\n\nWe've added support for streaming data from ThousandEyes to Splunk Cloud Platform and Splunk Enterprise using the ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry API. For more information, see Configuring ThousandEyes for Splunk Cloud or Enterprise Using the API.\n\n2024-06-21\n\nNew Makeover for ThousandEyes\n\nOn June 27th 2024, we will update the look and feel of our entire platform to better align with Cisco standards. This change includes redesigning our headers and left-hand navigation as well as updating our icons, fonts, and typography, all while avoiding any change in functionality. The changes will provide our customers with a consistent experience when switching between Cisco Cloud products and an improved modern user interface.\n\nAPI V6 End of Life Notification\n\nThis is a reminder about the end-of-life of API v6. API v6 will no longer be supported as of May 27th, 2025.\n\nOur v7 API introduces new capabilities for developers and DevOps-focused customers, ranging from standardization to performance and improved documentation. It aims to deliver a single cohesive API surface for all ThousandEyes product areas. The goal of our v7 API is to simplify and improve use cases while increasing interoperability with tools common to operations workflows.\n\nAccording to our API support policy, prior versions of our API are supported for one year, following an initial 90-day notification period.\n\nImproved Network Path Topology in Internet Insights\n\nIn Internet Insights' network topology screen, we have improved the differentiation between a node experiencing an outage and a node affected by the outage. This enhancement is intended to make it easier to understand where the source of an outage is coming from and where that outage is having impact on other network nodes. To learn more about this enhancement, see Network Outages Topology Tab.\n\nImproved UI for Endpoint Alert Rule Configuration\n\nUsers will see a new UI for the Alert Rules > Endpoint Agents page. This UI will make alert rule configuration more intuitive, with better performance and load times.\n\nIn Views 2.0, the page load tests summary now presents the following metrics, consistent with Views 1.0:\n\nDOM Load Time\n\nPage Load Time\n\nLoss and Latency Shown by Default in Views 2.0 for Network Outages and Network Events\n\nEarlier, when investigating network-based events, the redirection of the affected tests only selected loss as the metric of focus. However, network events can also be due to sudden spikes in latency. Therefore, now both loss and latency are selected by default when you view the affected tests from an event.\n\nPage load and transaction tests now support loading web pages that use WebGL. For web pages that trigger a browser-native notification, transaction tests now bypass these notifications.\n\nImprovements to Dashboard Filters\n\nImprove the Enabled/Included Dashboard Views We have enhanced the selection helper sidebar for the Tests dashboard filter. We have improved how to view only the tests that were selected in widgets and how to view only enabled tests.\n\nAdd Remaining Filter Values to Dashboard Filters Dashboard filters have expanded and are available for any variable that is applicable to a widget on an existing dashboard. If the combination of dashboard filters applied for a given data source is not intersectional, the widget notifies the user to adjust the filters.\n\nWidget Filters When a Widget Is \"Locked\"\n\nThe behavior of locked widget filters has been streamlined. When filters are locked for a given widget, only the widget filters are used, and the widget ignores any dashboard-level filters.\n\nContext Tooltips for Events\n\nIn order to better understand each event type, we have now added tooltips explaining each event type in the event detail.\n\nIncrease Available Stream Integrations per Account Group\n\nThe maximum amount of Stream Integrations per account group has been increased from 1 to 5, allowing you to create more streams to suit your needs.\n\nEndpoint Agent: Generic Installers to Replace Custom Installers\n\nAs announced previously, the customized links for the Endpoint Agent installers will no longer be available. Instead, generic installers will be used. The ThousandEyes UI section for creating customized installers is marked as Deprecated and will no longer be available after June 20, 2024. You can continue to use the old installers indefinitely. However, we recommend that you shift to the new generic installers.\n\nDocument Network Path Topology Enhancement for Internet Insights\n\nInternet Insights has improved the differentiation in the network topology screen between a node experiencing an outage and a node ‘affected by’ the outage. This enhancement is intended to make it easier to understand where the source of an outage is coming from and where that outage is having impact on other network nodes. To learn more about this enhancement, see Network Outages Topology Tab.\n\nServiceNow Incident Management Integration Support for Newest Versions\n\nWe have updated the ServiceNow Incident Management integration with ThousandEyes to support the latest versions, including the Utah, Vancouver, and Washington DC builds. Our documentation has also been updated to reflect the steps required for these latest versions.\n\nUbuntu 22.04 Support\n\nThousandEyes now supports installing Enterprise Agents on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (code name \"Jammy Jellyfish\", or just \"Jammy\"). For support dates, see the Enterprise Agent Support Lifecycle.\n\nBug Fixes\n\nResolved timestamp inconsistencies for PDF exports of dashboards.\n\nFixed an issue where the dashboard selector list was not surfaced in the expected order of most recent to oldest.\n\nFixed a bug that was showing inconsistent availability metrics for the scheduled tests in the Agent View. In particular, the availability was showing the opposite value (i.e., 0% when it was 100%).\n\nThe list of agents assigned to an Endpoint Agent test was not correctly sorted when more than 10 agents were assigned. The Edit Test side panel from the Endpoint Test Settings section now correctly sorts the agents assigned to a test.\n\nFixed a cosmetic bug that was incorrectly showing the agents running a test. When clicking a specific test in the Test Settings tab from the Endpoint Agents section, the user is able to see the amount of agents assigned to that test and the agents that are actually running that test. The Agents running the tests value was incorrectly computed and has been corrected.\n\nFixed a bug that was not showing the labels assigned to each agent in the Endpoint Agent Settings section with some screen size/resolution ratios. The user should now always be able to see the labels independently of the conditions of the screen.\n\nFixed a bug that was reporting \"No items available!\" when using special characters in the search of SSID and BSSID filters in the Endpoint Agent. User should now be able to search for those SSID and BSSID that include special characters.\n\nTo keep consistency with the rest of ThousandEyes UI, when clicking on a link that redirects the user to another area within ThousandEyes (e.g., \"Open in Views\" or \"Open in Agent Views\" when selecting a specific agent), the new area will be opened on the same browser tab instead of opening a new one.\n\nNew Cloud Agents\n\nBeijing, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nBeijing, China (China Telecom) (IPv6)\n\nBeijing, China (China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nChangsha, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nChengdu, China (IPv6)\n\nChengdu, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nChongqing, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nDalian, China (China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nFoshan, China (IPv6)\n\nGuangzhou, China (IPv6)\n\nGuangzhou, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nGuangzhou, China (China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nJinan, China (China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nNanjing, China (IPv6)\n\nNingbo, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nShanghai, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nShanghai, China (China Telecom) (IPv6)\n\nShanghai, China China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nShenyang, China (China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nShenzhen, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nShenzhen, China (China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nShijiazhuang, China (China Unicom) (IPv6)\n\nTianjin, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nWenzhou, China (China Telecom) (IPv6)\n\nWuhan, China (China Telecom) (IPv6)\n\nWuxi, China (IPv6)\n\nXi'an, China (China Telecom) (IPv6)\n\nZhengzhou, China (China Mobile) (IPv6)\n\nFrankfurt, Germany (Vodafone)\n\nFrankfurt, Germany (Vodafone) (IPv6)\n\nPorto Alegre, Brazil\n\nLima, Peru\n\nSantiago, Chile\n\n2024-06-20\n\nIntroducing Unified Test Creation Workflow\n\nTo streamline the test creation experience, we will gradually introduce the new Unified Test Creation workflow starting June 20th. From the test settings, you can click on the Start Monitoring button to begin your monitoring journey. This allows you to create a single test or deploy from the built-in or user-defined templates.\n\nWe are also introducing suggestion cards to surface any available recommendations and integrations. These cards offer actions you can take to enhance your existing monitoring. Click the Set up Recommneded Tests card to find any discovered test recommendations and start deployment.\n\nTo switch back to the original test creation UI, click the “Switch to Classic test creation” button. For more information, see Templates: Select a Template via Start Monitoring.\n\n2024-06-18\n\nNew Bell Notifications and Improvements\n\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to improve user experience, we have added several new features to the \"bell\" notifications. These include:\n\nIndividual notifications can now be dismissed via the x button beside them in the notifications list.\n\nAll notifications can now be dismissed by clicking the new Dismiss All button.\n\nSome notifications are now contextual to the relevant account group, and will only appear in the notifications list when logged in to that account.\n\nThree new notification types have also been added:\n\nIntegrations available (only shows up if you don't have any integrations configured).\n\nRecommended Tests available (if you have an integration configured).\n\nYou have tests in a draft state.\n\nThese notifications will only be visible to users with the required permissions for setting up/configuring integrations and tests. In addition, they will only appear once every two of months, and will disappear after 7 days (unless dismissed before then). For tests in a draft state, notifications appear every 7 days as long as there are tests matching this state.\n\nFor more information about the bell notification, see Glossary: Bell Notification.\n\n2024-06-14\n\nIntroducing Near Real-time BGP Monitoring and Alerting\n\nThousandEyes will release near real-time BGP monitoring and alerting. BGP tests will have the ability to be run at a 1-minute interval (as compared to the current 15-minute interval). This means that Views for BGP tests will also show BGP test results in 1-minute windows. For alerting, the current 15-minute, round-based alerting will shift to the new time-based format capable of alerting at 1-minute intervals. We'll start rolling this out in batches in early July.\n\nTo enhance the tagging system at ThousandEyes, we will migrate all existing labels to tags in the backend. Unlike single-valued labels siloed by product area, tags are dynamic with key-value pairs that can be associated with multiple assets across products under a shared tag.\n\nStarting June 24, 2024, when you query for tags using the v7 API (e.g., /v7/tags), all labels will be listed in a tags format key:value. For example, an existing label with the value webex will be displayed as webex:webex, with the value duplicated as the key.\n\nLabels that were migrated to tags will include a field in the API response called legacyID, indicating that this tag was originally a label and was then migrated. legacyId corresponds to the numeric ID assigned to the original label. Tags that were created natively will have an empty value in the legacyID field in the API response. Tags are currently supported for CEA Tests, CEA Agents, Endpoint Scheduled Tests, and Dashboards. Tags are not applicable to Endpoint Agents.\n\nPlease note that this change is only visible via the API. The UI will continue to display labels as they are, and tags created using the API will not yet be visible in the UI. This will be updated when we introduce tags in the UI in a future release.\n\n2024-06-13\n\nIntroducing Enhanced Onboarding\n\nEnhanced Onboarding allows new ThousandEyes customers to onboard quickly and easily with personalized monitoring coverage recommendations based on email domains and best practice guides. In addition, you can select, configure, and deploy a wide range of certified templates. The process concludes with setting up notifications and integrations. Enhanced Onboarding guides new customers through every step, providing a seamless and tailored onboarding experience. To learn more about Templates, see Templates\n\n2024-06-11\n\nCreate Templates in UI\n\nYou can now create, edit and delete templates directly in the UI. You can modify the JSON contents of templates using a template editor in the UI, which includes syntax highlighting and intellisense to make editing and creating templates easier and less error prone than using the API. If you don't want to create a template from scratch, you can duplicate existing ThousandEyes templates and edit them. The template editor also supports editing and deleting templates. Note that editing or deleting built-in ThousandEyes templates is not supported.",

We are doing a large roll out of TE in our environment. I have found the fix for this, and it was partly down to my own error. For TE to run correctly you first need to apply HTTP config. If you use DNAc to install TE you will be a window pop up referenving to the HTTP configs. As soon as I applied the HTTP config I could see in the TE dashboard that the devices were now joined. Just as an FYI - I have had more problems with TE when trying to use DNAc as and the installation process. Using the CLI is much easier and quicker. Hope this helps.

When a user with a ThousandEyes endpoint agent installed on their machine joins a meeting through the Webex App, a Network Path line will be visible under Audio Quality in their participant details page. This line indicates the network path quality of audio data between the user’s client and the audio media node.\n\nIn general, audio and video data travel the same path, and serviced by the same media node, so you can get a good sense of what the user's video quality is like, too. The network path quality is displayed as dotted lines. Each dotted line is based on the intervals set in the automated session test.\n\nThousandEyes enterprise agents with Calling data centers\n\nSimilar to Webex Meetings, we have ThousandEyes Cloud Agents deployed on various Webex Calling data centers. These agents are available for all customers who have ThousandEyes agents on their enterprise network. The agents capture RTP traffic in a bidirectional way to help determine issues in the network path between the Webex Calling data center and the enterprise network.\n\nSee this article for best practices on how to set up tests with Webex Cloud Agents for Webex Calling.\n\nCurrently, ThousandEyes Cloud Agents can only monitor calls hosted a limited number of data centers.

      "# [ThousandEyes Enterprise Agent Proxy Certificate by community.cisco.com, user-id on 2024-08-26](https://community.cisco.com/t5/thousandeyes/thousandeyes-enterprise-agent-proxy-certificate/td-p/5165830)\nHi\n\nI've recently installed ThousandEyes Enterprise Agents on some Cat9300-48UXM running IOS-XE 17.9.5 and 17.12.4. Since company proxy is using internal CA certificates, I had to install those certificates in docker container as described here: https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/global-vantage-points/enterprise-agents/troubleshooting/installing-ca-certificates-on-enterprise-agents#installing-on-cisco-docker-devices\n\nThis was working fine until ThousandEyes updated itself which led to the removal of the installed certificates and loss of connectivity through proxy to ThousandEyes portal. After I reinstalled the certificates, connectivity was restored.\n\nIs there a way to:\n\n- Disable auto-update to prevent certificate removal?\n\n- Disable removal of manually installed certificates?\n\n- Automatically install certificates during auto-update?\n\nOr is there an other solution for this suboptimal behaviour?\n\nThank you!\n\nHi @dominikhug - welcome to the support community! I'm working on getting some input from our experts, but would like to ask you for a bit more detail on one thing first: when you say ThousandEyes updated itself, can you be a bit more specific?\n\nThe normal updates of the ThousandEyes service within the container should not remove the installed CA certificates, so it's really unusual to hear that it wiped them.\n\nDo you have any more specifics about what updated, when, and if there were any other details included?\n\nHi @Tyler Langston\n\nI currently have ThousandEyes Enterprise Agent installed on 4 Cat9300. All of them were suddenly offline in ThousandEyes dashboard putting following message in switchlog:\n\n108016: Aug 26 07:50:37.499: %IM-5-IOX_INST_NOTICE: Switch 1 R0/0: ioxman: IOX SERVICE ThousandEyes_Enterprise_Agent LOG: Error calling getController: Curl error: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate 108017: Aug 26 07:50:41.698: %IM-5-IOX_INST_NOTICE: Switch 1 R0/0: ioxman: IOX SERVICE ThousandEyes_Enterprise_Agent LOG: Error calling checkIn: Curl error: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate 108018: Aug 26 07:51:11.338: %IM-5-IOX_INST_NOTICE: Switch 1 R0/0: ioxman: IOX SERVICE ThousandEyes_Enterprise_Agent LOG: Error calling getController: Curl error: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate 108019: Aug 26 07:51:14.790: %IM-5-IOX_INST_NOTICE: Switch 1 R0/0: ioxman: IOX SERVICE ThousandEyes_Enterprise_Agent LOG: Error calling checkIn: Curl error: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate 108020: Aug 26 07:51:45.129: %IM-5-IOX_INST_NOTICE: Switch 1 R0/0: ioxman: IOX SERVICE ThousandEyes_Enterprise_Agent LOG: Error calling getController: Curl error: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate 108021: Aug 26 07:51:48.636: %IM-5-IOX_INST_NOTICE: Switch 1 R0/0: ioxman: IOX SERVICE ThousandEyes_Enterprise_Agent LOG: Error calling checkIn: Curl error: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate\n\nAfter I've reinstalled SSL certificate again on one of those switches, it was able to reconnect to dashboard. I can now see this reconnected switch has a different agent version (1.195.0) than those which are unable to reconnect (1.191.0). So I now suspect, agent has been updated automatically and somehow deleted the manually installed certificates. The certificates even disappeared from /usr/share/ca-certificates/-directory. Because of this change in agent version, I currently suspect this update was causing my issues.\n\nHi @dominikhug - thank you for this information, it's exactly what I needed! I got these details to my experts and they had some thoughts for you:\n\nThe normal update of the ThousandEyes service within the container should not remove the installed CA certificates. If the agent container image was automatically updated by some external process (process outside of the agent container), like as part of Catalyst Center or vManage, then this could have removed the CA certificate and it would need to be re-added after the container was reinstalled. Currently CA certificates have to be installed on the agent container after installation, we cannot pass them to the container during install. We note this in our docs here.\n\nAn \"update\" of the container image by an external source is considered a reinstall because an updated image of the container is downloaded, the old container is destroyed, and a new container is created with the new image.\n\nSince they still see the old agent in the platform, that leads us to believe that the agent has been reinstalled, thus creating a new agent. Reinstalling the agent should deploy a new updated agent, thus \"removing\" any custom changes like a CA cert (it is not \"removing\" anything, it is installing a new agent without the custom modifications).\n\nThis does not mean that the agent updating itself is what removed the CA certs. We'd need to investigate with them why the original containers stopped working, which prompted the reinstall of the new containers/re-adding the CA certificate to get the container online.\n\nPlease request the member contact our Support team so we can help them uncover more of what happened.\n\nIf you need help contacting support, we have a quick walkthrough of that process here!",

By utilizing robust telemetry data and AI-native technology, customers can now achieve digital resilience and transition from reactive to proactive operations by assuring user digital experience across domains for both owned and unowned environments.\n\n“A majority of outages are caused by operator error. To empower our customers to achieve digital resilience, we harness more than 650 billion daily measurements and utilize the power of AI across the global area network to go beyond human-scale operations,” said Jonathan Davidson, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Cisco Networking. “Digital Experience Assurance powered by ThousandEyes enables proactive, automated event remediation and can even correlate configuration histories across owned infrastructure and your public cloud infrastructure with experiences, which can mean the difference between a 4-hour outage and a 4-minute disruption.”\n\nOrganizations are competing in a digital landscape where brand reputation, revenue, and employee productivity depend on consistently delivering exceptional digital experiences to every user, everywhere, every time. In tandem, businesses have undergone key shifts that increase reliance on unowned infrastructure and environments, introducing exponential complexity for IT and networking teams that now face the challenge of providing exceptional digital experiences across enterprise, Internet, and cloud networks.\n\nCisco ThousandEyes collects and processes billions of daily measurements from both customer owned and unowned networks. It provides automated insights, proactive recommendations, and closed-loop operations tailored to customers. Now powering Digital Experience Assurance for Cisco Networking Cloud, ThousandEyes ingests device and telemetry data from across Cisco networking platforms, including Meraki and Catalyst. Leveraging AI, ThousandEyes surfaces insights and recommendations, and automatically feeds them to customers’ domain controllers and management systems. According to a commissioned Total Economic Impact™ study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Cisco, a composite organization representative of interviewed ThousandEyes customers reported a significant improvement in IT productivity and user experience. Mean time to resolution (MTTR) of issues decreased by 50-80%, and IT team productivity increased by more than 50%.\n\nThousandEyes Digital Experience Assurance already delivers AI-native assurance capabilities across Cisco Networking, including AI radio resource management (RRM) for Cisco Catalyst wireless, capacity planning for Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN, and device profiling with AI-based signatures for Cisco Identity Services Engine.\n\nToday’s announcements include:\n\nThousandEyes Cloud Insights extends end-to-end visibility deep into public cloud environments by providing topological mappings of its customers’ AWS environments, including service connectivity, configuration changes, and traffic characteristics. By correlating cloud infrastructure and services with user experience, application health, and end-to-end network paths, ThousandEyes delivers deep insight for network, SRE, and cloud operations teams, so they can rapidly identify and resolve their most challenging issues.\n\nThousandEyes Traffic Insights extends ThousandEyes visibility deeper into on-premises networks by collecting and correlating traffic flows with its synthetics measurements, enabling customers to rapidly detect performance issues and pinpoint them to real traffic bottlenecks and anomalies within their networks. By providing a unified view of external and internal network conditions, customers can streamline their operational workflows and reduce their mean time to identify (MTTI) and remediate issues—regardless of whether they own the network or not. ThousandEyes will support flow collection for both Cisco and non-Cisco networking platforms.\n\nThousandEyes Endpoint Experience is now enriched with Meraki Wi-Fi and Local Area Network (LAN) telemetry and device information, enabling customers to gain deeper insight into local network issues impacting user experience.\n\nMeraki Assurance Overview is now powered by ThousandEyes Internet and SaaS visibility, empowering customers with insight into performance beyond their Meraki Wi-Fi and LAN environment to rapidly pinpoint issues across owned and unowned domains.\n\nSupporting Comments\n\n“Worker productivity and customer satisfaction are top-ranked strategic business priorities for organizations of all sizes, industries, and regions. It is imperative for IT organizations to deliver consistently positive digital experiences to both employees and customers. The challenge is these digital experiences are determined by an increasingly complex technology infrastructure where networks, data centers, cloud services, security mechanisms, endpoints, and an ever-growing set of data and applications must all work in concert. Factor in the accelerating use of external systems and services within the infrastructure and further complications arise in measuring, managing, and, ultimately, delivering an overarching positive digital experience to all. The industry needs simpler,\" said Mark Leary, Director, Network Observability and Automation, IDC. \"The industry needs smarter. Comprehensive data collection and cross-domain data correlation, driven by applied intelligence and embedded automation, stands to have a dramatic impact on IT engineering and operations as well as business execution and outcomes.”\n\n\"Experiencing our modern, timeless, and artisan-crafted home furnishings is incredibly important. So when we moved from in-person showrooms to virtual environments, one of our biggest challenges was to make sure customers could have the same great in-person experience, but remotely,” said Mark Rodrigue, Senior Network Engineer, Room & Board. “Being able to see and manage the Internet environments we now leverage to connect with our customers has been a game changer for our ability to assure performance. Before using ThousandEyes, it could take us days to understand where an issue was occurring, but now, we’ve seen a 96% improvement in our response time—and that’s been a game-changer for both fixing issues and working with the cloud and Internet service providers that we rely on.”\n\nAdded Resources\n\nBlog: Entering the New Era of Digital Experience Assurance Across Every Network\n\nBlog: It’s Time to Take Control of Experiences and Transform Infrastructure Operations for AI\n\nPress Release: Cisco Reveals Nexus HyperFabric AI Clusters, A New Simplified Data Center Infrastructure Solution with NVIDIA for Generative AI\n\nAbout Cisco\n\nCisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide technology leader that securely connects everything to make anything possible.

That's because it has a broad, end-to-end view of every user and any application over any network.\n\nFounded 15 years ago, the company says it's been investing lots into AI in the past several years.\n\nBut now, ThousandEyes is making big, AI-focused changes to its platform aimed at giving its client base even more visibility over network quality and resilience.\n\nJoe Vaccaro, vice president and general manager of ThousandEyes, said DXA would provide the ability \"not only to resolve issues before they begin to impact my users, but leverage broad data to actually begin to predict and give forward intelligence on what might happen across infrastructure, to proactively address it before it begins to significantly degrade overall digital experiences.\"\n\n\"Digital experience assurance helps to build upon this evolutionary journey beyond metrics, beyond monitoring, towards a platform that delivers on a closed loop system,\" Vaccaro told CNBC in an exclusive interview.\n\nAmong the other capabilities, DXA comes with are the ability for businesses to correlate, analyze, diagnose, predict, optimize, and remediate with little or no manual intervention.\n\nCisco ThousandEyes says its platform is powered by over 650 billion daily measurements collected from around the globe. The firm committed to giving businesses visibility into their internal environments, including on-premises networks and cloud environments.\n\nThe product builds on Cisco ThousandEyes' Event Detection tech, which the company says already reduces the time taken to detect a disruption event to mere minutes and less staffing, rather than hours and multiple engineers.\n\nAI-generated internet status reports\n\nVaccaro also teased the development of a new product at Cisco ThousandEyes that, once complete, would enable users to generate AI-create scripts showing the status of global ISP (internet service provider), public cloud, and edge service networks, or an application's connection a network.\n\nThis is similar to what ThousandEyes currently offers for internet monitoring, but with AI automatically doing the work rather than people.\n\n\"That is in development and should be seeing the light of day here in the very, very near future,\" Vaccaro told CNBC.\n\nThe product would incorporate large language models, which are considered the bedrock of generative AI systems like ChatGPT and Google Gemini.\n\nRacking up 100 million users to date, ChatGPT was catapulted into global virality just months after its creator OpenAI released it. The app's success stoked massive hype around artificial intelligence, with companies of all stripes making developments of their own in the space.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct the day of the announcement.",

      "# [Microsoft 365 Services Hit By Outage by Wade Tyler Millward](https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2024/microsoft-365-services-hit-by-outage)\nThis is at least the third major outage for Microsoft in July.\n\nDays after a faulty CrowdStrike update downed millions of Windows machines worldwide and a coincidental Microsoft Azure region outage in the United States, Microsoft has reported “access issues and degraded performance” for a variety of services and features under its Microsoft 365 umbrella.\n\nThe Redmond, Wash.-based cloud and AI tools vendor posted to X – formerly known as Twitter – at 5:48 a.m. Pacific Time on Tuesday that “we’re currently investigating access issues and degraded performance with multiple Microsoft 365 services and features,” according to the X post. “More information can be found under MO842351 in the admin center. The outage occurred just hours before Microsoft reports earnings for its fourth fiscal quarter.\n\nAt 7:51 a.m. Pacific, Microsoft added: “We’ve applied mitigations and rerouted user requests to provide relief. We're monitoring the service to confirm resolution and further information can be found at https://status.cloud.microsoft or under MO842351 in the admin center.” When a CRN reporter tried to access the cloud status website about 10 minutes after the X post, the reporter received a “site can’t be reached” error message.\n\n[RELATED: Microsoft Q4 2024 Earnings Preview: 5 Things To Know]\n\nMicrosoft 365 Outage\n\nCRN has reached out to Microsoft for comment.\n\nOn a Microsoft Azure Status website, the vendor said that “starting approximately at 11:45 UTC on 30 July 2024, a subset of customers may have experienced issues connecting to Microsoft services globally.”\n\n“We have implemented networking configuration changes and have performed failovers to alternate networking paths to provide relief,” according to the status page. Monitoring telemetry shows improvement in service availability from approximately 14:10 UTC onwards, and we are continuing to monitor to ensure full recovery.\n\nA chart breaking down the issues warned that users of any region in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) could face network infrastructure issues.\n\nOokla’s Downdetector website showed reports of M365 outages reaching a 24-hour high of 363 Tuesday around 6:22 a.m. Pacific. Azure outage reports reached a 24-hour high of 483 at around the same time.\n\nUsers in the “SysAdmin” Subreddit reported experiencing outages in Eastern Europe, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the Eastern U.S.\n\nSome users found humor in the situation. “Why does Team's never go down for me? An afternoon free of calls or messages would be lovely,” one user wrote, referring to Microsoft’s popular communications and collaboration platform.\n\nJuly 19 Outage\n\nThe outage does not appear related to the firestorm that has erupted since a faulty CrowdStrike update interfered with millions of Windows machines on July 19 – with some Windows users including Delta Air Lines still dealing with the effects of the outage days later.\n\nHours before the CrowdStrike incident, “Microsoft experienced an unrelated (outage) that affected access to various Azure services and customer accounts configured with a single-region service in the Central US region,” according to a July 26 blog post by Cisco subsidiary ThousandEyes.\n\n“This outage occurred around the same time as the CrowdStrike incident, from 9:56 PM (UTC) on July 18 to 12:15 PM (UTC) on July 19,” according to the post. “The close timing of the two incidents may have caused some confusion and led to the larger global IT outage being mistakenly attributed to Microsoft. Although Microsoft systems were affected during the CrowdStrike incident, it was completely unrelated to the Azure incident.”\n\nThe outage included “failures of service management operations and connectivity or availability of services,” with ThousandEyes saying that “connectivity into the Central US region appeared impaired, with forwarding loss being observed at the ingress points to the affected region … Among those impacted were Confluent, Elastic Cloud, and Microsoft 365.”\n\n“Microsoft’s status update also identified a configuration change as the underlying cause that impacted the connectivity of backend services, specifically storage clusters and compute resources. This then triggered some automated mitigation with services being restarted repeatedly.”\n\nThousandEyes also reported on an Azure issue July 13 that led to service interruptions for Grammarly.\n\n“Azure reported that the Azure OpenAI (AOAI) service has an automation system that is implemented regionally but uses a global configuration to manage the lifecycle for certain backend resources,” according to the report. “A change was made to update this configuration to delete unused resources in an AOAI internal subscription. There was a quota on the number of storage accounts on this subscription, which were unused and intended to be cleaned up to prevent storage quota pressure.”",

      "# [Duo Single Sign-On for ThousandEyes](https://duo.com/docs/sso-thousandeyes)\nFeedback\n\nWas this page helpful? Let us know how we can make it better.\n\nOverview\n\nAs business applications move from on-premises to cloud hosted solutions, users experience password fatigue due to disparate logons for different applications. Single sign-on (SSO) technologies seek to unify identities across systems and reduce the number of different credentials a user has to remember or input to gain access to resources.\n\nWhile SSO is convenient for users, it presents new security challenges. If a user's primary password is compromised, attackers may be able to gain access to multiple resources. In addition, as sensitive information makes its way to cloud-hosted services it is even more important to secure access by implementing two-factor authentication and zero-trust policies.\n\nAbout Duo Single Sign-On\n\nDuo Single Sign-On is our cloud-hosted SSO product which layers Duo's strong authentication and flexible policy engine on top of ThousandEyes logins. Duo Single Sign-On acts as an identity provider (IdP), authenticating your users using existing on-premises Active Directory (AD) or another SSO IdP. Duo SSO prompts users for two-factor authentication and performs endpoint assessment and verification before permitting access to ThousandEyes.\n\nDuo Single Sign-On is available in Duo Premier, Duo Advantage, and Duo Essentials plans, which also include the ability to define policies that enforce unique controls for each individual SSO application. For example, you can require that Salesforce users complete two-factor authentication at every login, but only once every seven days when accessing ThousandEyes. Duo checks the user, device, and network against an application's policy before allowing access to the application.\n\nConfigure Single Sign-On\n\nBefore configuring ThousandEyes with Duo SSO using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 authentication you'll first need to enable Duo Single Sign-On for your Duo account and configure a working authentication source.\n\nOnce you have your SSO authentication source working, continue to the next step of creating the ThousandEyes application in Duo.\n\nCreate the ThousandEyes Application in Duo\n\nLog on to the Duo Admin Panel and navigate to Applications → Protect an Application.\n\nLocate the entry for ThousandEyes with a protection type of \"2FA with SSO hosted by Duo (Single Sign-On)\" in the applications list. Click Protect to the far-right to start configuring ThousandEyes. See Protecting Applications for more information about protecting applications with Duo and additional application options. You'll need the information on the ThousandEyes page under Downloads later.\n\nThousandEyes uses the Mail attribute when authenticating. We've mapped the <Email Address> bridge attribute to Duo Single Sign-On supported authentication source attributes as follows:\n\nBridge Attribute Active Directory SAML IdP <Email Address> mail Email\n\nIf you are using a non-standard email attribute for your authentication source, check the Custom attributes box and enter the name of the attribute you wish to use instead.\n\nYou can adjust additional settings for your new SAML application at this time — like changing the application's name from the default value, enabling self-service, or assigning a group policy.\n\nKeep the Duo Admin Panel tab open. You will come back to it later.\n\nDuo Universal Prompt\n\nThe Duo Universal Prompt provides a simplified and accessible Duo login experience for web-based applications, offering a redesigned visual interface with security and usability enhancements.\n\nUniversal Prompt Traditional Prompt\n\nWe've already updated the Duo ThousandEyes application hosted in Duo's service to support the Universal Prompt, so there's no action required on your part to update the application itself. If you created your ThousandEyes application before March 2024, you can activate the Universal Prompt experience for users from the Duo Admin Panel. ThousandEyes applications created after March 2024 have the Universal Prompt activated by default.\n\nIf you created your ThousandEyes application before March 2024, it's a good idea to read the Universal Prompt Update Guide for more information, about the update process and the new login experience for users, before you activate the Universal Prompt for your application.\n\nActivate Universal Prompt\n\nActivation of the Universal Prompt is a per-application change. Activating it for one application does not change the login experience for your other Duo applications.\n\nThe \"Universal Prompt\" area of the application details page shows that this application is \"Ready to activate\", with these activation control options:\n\nShow traditional prompt: Your users experience Duo's traditional prompt via redirect when logging in to this application.\n\nShow new Universal Prompt: (Default) Your users experience the Universal Prompt via redirect when logging in to this application.\n\nThe application's Universal Prompt status shows \"Activation complete\" here and on the Universal Prompt Update Progress report.\n\nShould you ever want to roll back to the traditional prompt, you can return to this setting and change it back to Show traditional prompt. However, this will still deliver the Duo prompt via redirect, not in an iframe. Keep in mind that support for the traditional Duo prompt ended for the majority of applications in March 2024.\n\nUniversal Update Progress\n\nClick the See Update Progress link to view the Universal Prompt Update Progress report. This report shows the update availability and migration progress for all your Duo applications. You can also activate the new prompt experience for multiple supported applications from the report page instead of visiting the individual details pages for each application.\n\nEnable ThousandEyes for SSO\n\nLog into your ThousandEyes account as an administrator.\n\nIn the left menu sidebar, navigate to Account Settings → Users and Roles.\n\nClick the Roles tab.\n\nIn the top right corner of the page, click New Role.

When there's a need for detailed insights into network paths, performance, and potential bottlenecks across not only local networks but also Internet and Cloud provider networks, ThousandEyes can provide additional value. Integrating ThousandEyes with Splunk Observability Cloud via OpenTelemetry offers significant advantages for organizations seeking comprehensive insight into their IT environments. This integration allows for seamless data collection and correlation across both network and application performance domains, leveraging OpenTelemetry's standardized framework for telemetry data. By combining ThousandEyes' detailed network intelligence with Splunk's powerful analytics capabilities, organizations can achieve much needed visibility into an an observability solution that enhances their ability to diagnose and resolve issues quickly. This holistic view not only improves troubleshooting efficiency by pinpointing whether issues originate from network or application layers but also empowers teams to proactively monitor and optimize performance, ultimately driving improved digital resilience and user satisfaction. There are multiple use cases for how organizations can leverage this integration, but for the purpose of this blog post, let's consider just one, yet a typical scenario.\n\nButtercup Manufacturing optimizes Application Performance with Splunk Observability Cloud and Cisco ThousandEyes\n\nButtercup Manufacturing operates a cloud-native, microservices-based application deployed on a Kubernetes cluster in a public cloud. This application is accessed by employees from multiple sites across the United States. To ensure optimal performance and user satisfaction, the application is instrumented with OpenTelemetry, enabling it to be observed via Splunk Observability Cloud.\n\nThe IT team at Buttercup Manufacturing is keen to monitor both the application's performance and its accessibility from various locations, with an emphasis on measuring local networks as well as external networks like the Internet and Cloud providers. To achieve this, ThousandEyes Enterprise Agents are deployed at each site. These agents are configured to run Page Load tests, which measure how quickly the application loads and assess crucial network parameters, such as latency, packet loss, and jitter.\n\nNote: ThousandEyes tests are designed so that when a top-level test is executed (e.g., Page Load), all underlying tests, such as Agent-to-Server, are also performed.\n\nTo integrate Splunk Observability Cloud with ThousandEyes, the first step is to create an ingest token in Splunk Observability Cloud. For detailed instructions, please refer to the Splunk documentation. Once the ingest token is configured, the remaining configuration steps are completed within ThousandEyes platform (Integrations > ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry).\n\nThe following steps are required for the integration:\n\n1. Unique Integration Name: Assign a unique name to your OpenTelemetry integration.\n\n2. Target Configuration: Choose HTTP as the target and use the dedicated URL for your REALM:\n\nFor Metrics: https://ingest.{REALM}.signalfx.com/v2/datapoint/otlp\n\nFor Traces: https://ingest.{REALM}.signalfx.com/v2/trace/otlp\n\nPlease refer to the Splunk documentation for more details.\n\nNote: The support for traces has been recently added to ThousandEyes OpenTelemetry. It is currently only supported for Page Load and Transaction tests.\n\n3. Preset Configurations\n\nHere you can choose Splunk Observability Cloud from the list, so correct formatting and options will be automatically populated.\n\n4. Custom Headers:\n\nContent-Type: application/x-protobuf\n\nX-SF-Token: <ingest-token-from-splunk-observability-cloud>\n\n5. OpenTelemetry Signal:\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry supports the following signals:\n\nMetrics: Supported for all test types.\n\nTraces: Supported for web transaction and page load test types.\n\n6. Data Model Version:\n\nThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry supports the following data model versions:\n\nData Model Version 1\n\nData Model Version 2 (Default)\n\nRecommended Usage: Version 2 is the default and recommended version for exporting telemetry data to all observability backends, except Grafana/Prometheus for metrics. OpenTelemetry trace signals are supported only in version 2.\n\n7. Test Data Configuration: Select the tests for which you want to send data to Splunk Observability Cloud.\n\nPlease refer to the ThousandEyes documentation for more details.\n\nIn this example, we utilize metrics as the OpenTelemetry signal. Within a few minutes, metrics from ThousandEyes should appear in Splunk Observability Cloud, specifically within the Metrics Finder, which serves as a starting point for visualizing and analyzing the data. With this data now accessible, Buttercup Manufacturing's IT department can set up detectors to automatically monitor these metrics for anomalies or thresholds, alerting the team to potential issues before they impact operations. Below is an example of a detector that triggers when network latency for one of the locations exceeds 100ms.\n\nAdditionally, Buttercup Manufacturing's IT department can create comprehensive and powerful dashboards that integrate both application and network metrics. These dashboards provide a unified view of the entire system, enabling IT teams to quickly compare performance metrics and isolate issues. This holistic approach facilitates faster identification of the root cause of problems, significantly reducing both the Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and the Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR).\n\nSince charts in Splunk Observability Cloud are completely interactive, we can conduct essential analysis directly within the platform without having to switch over to ThousandEyes.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, integrating ThousandEyes with Splunk Observability Cloud via OpenTelemetry provides a powerful solution for enhancing IT operations and digital experience. This integration offers comprehensive visibility across network and application layers, facilitating streamlined troubleshooting and performance optimization. By enabling faster identification of whether an issue resides within the application or network, it helps teams quickly pinpoint the root cause, which significantly reduces both the Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and the Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR). As demonstrated by Buttercup Manufacturing, organizations adopting this approach can enhance digital resilience and maintain efficient, reliable IT infrastructure.",

The combination of both solutions is a powerful tool to enhance the customer experience with proactive 24/7 monitoring.\n\nFor more details on ThousandEyes, you can revisit our previous blog, “Maximize Managed Services: Cisco ThousandEyes Drives MSPs Towards Outstanding Client Experiences.”\n\nWith ThousandEyes on Meraki MX, you can instantly activate monitoring at scale and continuously monitor network performance. This capability reduces the operational burden on your team and provides IT admins with real-time insights into application health and network status. Having this Enterprise Agent running natively on your Meraki MX offers the MSP the following three advantages:\n\n1. Easy Deployment and Management\n\nDeploying ThousandEyes on Meraki MX is straightforward. Enterprise agents can be deployed to MX67 devices and above, running a minimum firmware version of 18.104. The Meraki Dashboard facilitates one-click enrollment, simplifying the setup process. This integration leverages ThousandEyes test templates to monitor popular SaaS applications, providing continuous visibility and reducing operational workloads.\n\nThere’s no need to deal with the complexities of installing, operating, and maintaining other enterprise agents running on virtual machines in the customer network. You can activate them with a few clicks from your Meraki Dashboard and get the proper credentials for your customer organization.\n\n2. Proactive Issue Resolution\n\nThe integration of ThousandEyes with Meraki MX devices enables proactive monitoring of network and application performance. This solution allows IT teams to detect and remediate issues before they spread, ensuring optimal performance and user experience. Leveraging ThousandEyes to your current Meraki WAN services you can rapidly identify and address issues impacting SaaS applications and other critical services across every branch site. This proactive approach helps maintain high levels of service availability and performance, reducing the need for manual interventions and administrative overhead.\n\n3. Simplified App Management\n\nThe Meraki App Platform ensures that ThousandEyes updates are delivered seamlessly, minimizing disruptions. Containers provide isolation and limit resources, ensuring stability and performance. This package-centric approach simplifies support and maintenance, allowing you to focus on delivering exceptional service.\n\nMeeting requirements and optimizing licensing model\n\nFirst, considering the Meraki side of the equation, the first milestone is to ensure that your customer meets the hardware and license requirements. You can run this ThousandEyes agent on Meraki MX67 and up models with Meraki Advanced Security or Meraki Secure SDWAN+ licenses.\n\nLet’s pause for a second to review Thousand Eyes licensing. ThousandEyes offers a flexible licensing model tailored for Managed Service Providers (MSPs). The model is structured around the three main types of agents: Cloud, Enterprise, and Endpoint Agents. Consumption depends on the type of agents and the types of tests executed.\n\nReturning to the offering, ThousandEyes uses a tiered unit consumption model, where different test types (e.g., HTTP server tests, network tests, Web layer tests, etc.) consume varying numbers of units. The frequency and complexity of tests affect the unit consumption. This model allows MSPs to scale their monitoring capabilities according to client needs, manage costs effectively, and offer customized, high-value services.\n\nA good starting point is to gather the last month’s tickets received and average the root cause analysis. Then, review the resolution times and the steps performed, and cross-reference them with the available tests. You will soon find ways to build your unique tier offering, adding customer value and improving your NOC operational process.\n\nTransform your managed services with ThousandEyes and Meraki MX\n\nIntegrating ThousandEyes with Meraki MX is a game-changer for managed services partners. It provides comprehensive visibility, proactive monitoring, and seamless management, enabling you to deliver superior digital experiences for your clients. By leveraging this powerful combination, you can enhance your service offerings, reduce downtime, and ensure optimal network and application performance.\n\nStay ahead of the curve and empower your clients with the best network and application monitoring.
