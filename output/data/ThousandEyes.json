You couldn't connect to our website? We show in this city of Arizona there was an outage and none of the Thousand Eye agents could reach us. It's a big deal for us since we're expected to be up 24/7.

We can influence inbound or route around outbound issues, by depreferring or completely shutting down peering with our upstream SPs. This has been useful and practical even with ASes 2-3 hops away from us, though usually if they are smaller networks that have only a few paths to/from us.\n2. Share ThousandEyes data with NOCs that insist there is no problem in their network or with our peering points.  Of course useful only with our direct peers. This can shorten time to resolution for my team, or give us ammo to request SLA credits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn both cases, it is mostly useful when the problem is persistent, longer lasting or recurring often. It doesn't benefit us if it's transient as we have to do all the identification and mitigation manually but that's more an \"us\" problem and not necessarily a factor of any monitoring tool like ThousandEyes.\n\n#### Comment ID i5lsrb9 with +1 score by [(Bubbasdahname, Reddit, 2022-04-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/u78idu/experiences_with_thousandeyes/i5lsrb9/) (in reply to ID i5g2nwb):\nIf we are down, we have to pay SLA fees.

I am also curious about how expensive ThousandEyes is.\n\nThanks for any help!\n\n## Comment ID i8tqg7f with +18 score by [(lol_umadbro, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uqvmps/anyone_using_thousandeyes_endpoint_agents/i8tqg7f/) (in reply to ID uqvmps):\nWe’re using it, primarily enterprise agents though. All of our licenses came from units bundled with Cat9k purchases, so I can’t speak to the pricing front. \n\nSince we have very limited licenses, we do not run any tests 24/7/365. We set up tests during break-fix troubleshooting, specific to the issues being reported. This lets us maximize our few licenses rather than running them constantly. \n\nThis may fit your use case based on what you described.\n\n## Comment ID i8tudmh with +14 score by [(port53, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uqvmps/anyone_using_thousandeyes_endpoint_agents/i8tudmh/) (in reply to ID uqvmps):\nTE is very expensive and the enterprise agents are... not very reliable.\n\nThere was recently an issue where the agents all tried to upgrade themselves (they're docker containers that think they're VMs) and the upgrade was failing, but that didn't stop them from endlessly downloading the upgrade bundle to the tune of several Gb/s across them all.\n\nWe just renewed but are on the path to replace TE with something less brutal on price.  Only reason we didn't this time is because we didn't have enough time to rewrite some integrations but they're on the road map now.\n\nThere has to be better/cheaper solutions for monitoring home users.\n\n### Comment ID i8urg9g with +7 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uqvmps/anyone_using_thousandeyes_endpoint_agents/i8urg9g/) (in reply to ID i8tudmh):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID i8vl0ha with +1 score by [(suddenlyreddit, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uqvmps/anyone_using_thousandeyes_endpoint_agents/i8vl0ha/) (in reply to ID i8urg9g):\n> Stay away from Zscaler and their solution\n\nWait, which solution, do you know?

It's best for monitoring links and internet health outside of your organization's control to aid troubleshooting so you're not on a P1 for an hour trying to understand the scope of a reported issue when the culprit is say a flapping link in the core of one of your ISPs.\n\nYou're really better off using your endpoint management to give you that kind of data.

Another tool for the tool belt. Whether it's a user's home connection or not, if its a work provided PC/laptop in which they reporting as having issues on, they're going to reach out to their workplace's support first almost 99% of the time. \n\n2. Split-tunnel + \"internet website is slow\" =/= not my problem. Cloud services need to be taken into consideration and to do so sanely, you need some insight from the perspective of the user's connection. This is also huge in cases where suddenly multiple or a subset of users are reporting similar issues and tools such as TE, you may be able to quickly identify this is an issue with a provider/region or even know about it before the report come in. Instantly slashing to time needed to investigate 10s or 100s of support cases.\n\n3. May be controversial but non-voluntary and required WFH change, at least for post-employment perspective, does impose at minimum a very high level support requirement of the business (some case required legal reimbursement). 99% of users know zero networking, purchase the cheapest plans and use the provided combo routers which serves their purposes. So when they move to WFH and suddenly have difficulty maintaining their level of work due to connectivity issues, the business should at least provide incredible basic tshooting or at least guidance whether on what to relay to their provider or a potential requirement to upgrade their service/equipment. I have witnessed remote users spend hundreds on routers (due to marketing non-sense) and stuck in contracts due to service plan upgrades because they were grasping at straws for a stable work experience and in the end being let go when it could have been solved with basic tshooting.\n\nBasically, if you're going to have to deal with the support request regardless, a tool that speeds up tshooting and reduces back and forth conversations has a value of its own. Time spent even reading a support case is time spent not working on other support cases. That time is a cost in and of itself.\n\n#### Comment ID i8uwm46 with +1 score by [(ChuckIT82, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uqvmps/anyone_using_thousandeyes_endpoint_agents/i8uwm46/) (in reply to ID i8uktkx):\nexact same 3 points why we're using it.\n\n### Comment ID i8u6xc0 with +5 score by [(certpals, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uqvmps/anyone_using_thousandeyes_endpoint_agents/i8u6xc0/) (in reply to ID i8u4kw2):\nThat's exactly what I thought.

But I work in a small enough org (approx 250 users), where if executive Bob has issues at home, it is still IT's problem. And even if it's receptionist Jane and she puts a ticket in while working from home, we still investigate instead of saying \"sorry, since you are at home we can't troubleshoot\".\n\nBut to be honest, my post doesn't necessarily come from only that type of scenario. Last week, we had users at a branch complain of performance issues with Salesforce. Well, at HQ we didn't have any issues with Salesforce, and the network didn't have any obvious red flags (I have a network monitor at our datacenter, and the traffic to that branch seemed fine, the throughput seemed fine, ping, tracert, etc all seemed fine). So there I am trying to figure out why this site was having performance issues to Salesforce, with no visibility as to why the issue was only impacting them. And at the time, I remember thinking to myself: \"doesn't something like ThousandEyes have the ability to say \"here is where the issue is between your user and Salesforce\"?\"\n\nTurns out the issue was a portion of the Salesforce page was trying to load from Germany, and Germany was blocked at that branch.\n\n#### Comment ID i8unrc1 with +1 score by [(Syde80, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uqvmps/anyone_using_thousandeyes_endpoint_agents/i8unrc1/) (in reply to ID i8udlma):\n> where if executive Bob has issues at home, it is still IT's problem.\n\nThis is something I really love from having moved from a smaller org to municipal government.

The path visualisation, experience score, the waterfall chart and local network (both wired and wireless) are some cool features. Further you can run proactive tests to monitor apps and get alerted before they degrade and not just use it as a reactive tool.\n\n## Comment ID i8uaixi with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uqvmps/anyone_using_thousandeyes_endpoint_agents/i8uaixi/) (in reply to ID uqvmps):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID i8ulh07 with +2 score by [(dstew74, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uqvmps/anyone_using_thousandeyes_endpoint_agents/i8ulh07/) (in reply to ID i8uaixi):\nI wish I could afford ExtraHop.

There is nothing in logs on the router or local switches that confirm this. Even the client ports dose not report down time or any connection issues. I also have an Aruba UXI client on LAN and Wifi, there is no indications of any issues here ether. I’m looking for a software I can use to simulate a client, the software should simulate client traffic and provide as much detail logging as possible.

Every network needs monitoring.\n\nSet up a monitoring solution. There are loads to choose from from paid for solutions like logic monitor and solarwinds to free trials from PRTG to opensource stuff like Zabbix or LibreNMS.\n\nGet something that can monitor what's going on with key interfaces and do basic ICMP availability monitoring.\n\nAnother thing you need is centralised logging. Get yourself a syslog server set up somewhere and get all your devices logging to it.\n\nWhile you're at that, get them all sync'd to a central NTP source so those log timestamps all line up and can be correlated.\n\n\nThen you can go back to your users and ask them to give details of exactly what they experience, and exactly when they experience it. Then you can look at your monitoring and logging for those specific times and see if anything is amiss.\n\nTrying to troubleshoot networks, especially remote ones, without proper monitoring and logging is near impossible. At best it's pure guess work.\n\n## Comment ID j4nyv6m with +1 score by [(turbov6camaro, Reddit, 2023-01-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/10doq7t/network_client_analyserlogger/j4nyv6m/) (in reply to ID 10doq7t):\nGet ping plotter you can setup a ping for every one half second (0.5) and you can also have it check basic ports if you have something on the that will respond\n\nThe also have a cloud option you can put and agent on the PC and check that way too \n\nIs it every user or just one are two?

Currently we use PRTG which works great for downtime, netflow and such. But i am looking for something with a bit more depth. Currently we are not able to scan switches and access points, due to those devices being on a non vpn management vlan, but maybe some tool would be able to father data from those devices using the meraki dashboard api?\n\n\n\nAlso i would really like to be able to test the connection between point A and point B. Something like the features of Cisco ThousandEyes. Without it being so gosh darn expensive.\n\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n## Comment ID jd776mk with +5 score by [(chiapeterson, Reddit, 2023-03-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/meraki/comments/11ydm1l/what_do_you_use_for_network_monitoring/jd776mk/) (in reply to ID 11ydm1l):\nDomotz\n\n### Comment ID jd7our1 with +2 score by [(VioletiOT, Reddit, 2023-03-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/meraki/comments/11ydm1l/what_do_you_use_for_network_monitoring/jd7our1/) (in reply to ID jd776mk):\nawesome!! :)\n\n## Comment ID jd7el87 with +7 score by [(MartinJSa, Reddit, 2023-03-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/meraki/comments/11ydm1l/what_do_you_use_for_network_monitoring/jd7el87/) (in reply to ID 11ydm1l):\nSorry this is a bit of a plug - but I'm product director for a company called Highlight that creates a network service assurance (inc monitoring) platform that's quite tightly integrated with Meraki's dashboard APIs - we're on the Meraki app marketplace [here](https://apps.meraki.io/en-US/apps/381711/highlight-service-assurance-platform/overview). There is a quite a lot of Meraki data that's only available via the APIs so we've given up mostly with SNMP polling of Meraki devices. \n\nMeraki does a continuity test from its MX appliances by default to [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8), but that's configurable and you can add other test endpoints. Annoyingly we don't have that test data in Highlight yet (we do the VPN test data) but I'm planning on bringing it in soon.\n\n### Comment ID jd9296c with +3 score by [(burnte, Reddit, 2023-03-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/meraki/comments/11ydm1l/what_do_you_use_for_network_monitoring/jd9296c/) (in reply to ID jd7el87):\nPersonally I thank you for noting in your post that you work for them.

          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "Now, on to the negatives.\r\n\r\n * Culture of dishonesty: If a customer finds a major bug, it may be brushed off and fixed silently. If engineering finds a bug that affects customers and they don't know, it's silently fixed and no credits/notice is given, even for core functionality. Staff do not want to trust customers with the truth and feel that they can better earn their trust by hiding problems from them by lying. Staff may also not trust themselves for repercussions of their own bugs.\r\n\r\n * Fishy use of J1 VISAs for full-time, non-intern employees from abroad. You are quite likely reading this as someone outside of the US and may not know what a J1 is. If you don't, please read up on J1 VISAs. ThousandEyes will generally submit an application for an H1B VISA. Unfortunately, the process sucks and many people don't get accepted. What's sketchy is that they follow it up with a J1 VISA application if the H1B VISA doesn't go through. H1B is for workers, J1 is very explictly for interns at most. ThousandEyes had had one intern in all of my time there, the rest were clearly full time employees. The J1 VISA employees at ThousandEyes often have to fill out forms saying what they learned. These are things they probably learned ten years ago. While immigration is difficult in the US, I say this because you need to be aware that there is a chance (I am not a lawyer) than if you are sponsored on a J1 VISA for a non-intern position in ThousandEyes, you are doing something illegal (as would be ThousandEyes). Furthermore, there's a chance that ThousandEyes, if busted, might send you back home with a very difficult time immigrating in the future. Maybe in this political climate that will never happen, I don't know. But new recruits are not told this as far as I know, and you should know because it may be a huge risk. If you are from abroad, please read up on US immigration, J1 VISAs, and H1B VISAs. One last thing. If you do come in on an H1B VISA, salary information is public. You can go online and search for the salaries of many of the ThousandEyes staff. Maybe you don't want to do this, that's fine. But you should be told because it is public and thus no secret. You can do the same thing for Google, Facebook, etc, if you want to.\r\n\r\n * Not a very organic culture, discussions about the product often end up being told to go to off-topic areas. In particular, the VP of engineering will shoot down these conversations, but several in engineering are not very open minded. All in all, the culture at the dining table is pretty good, but when it comes to working it's not always the greatest mix.\r\n\r\n * The engineering staff is a huge mix of cultures. Most people speak English as a second language. This is very nice for diversity, but there are some obvious communication difficulties. All and all, cultural differences seem to be handled quite well. I've made some great friends there. Still, communication can be difficult.\r\n\r\n * Sales is in the same office and rarely stays around engineering for happy hours and such. There's a little bit of tension over their distance.Sales rarely stick around for lunch. Their turnover rate is very, very high (many gone in 3 months).\r\n\r\n * While this may or may not be exactly true, many of the engineers have more education than experience. While this is not a problem in and of itself, there are some narrow minds there that take a while to open up. I would advise that they emphasize more on experience in the future, rather than pulling in PHD students without professional experience.\r\n\r\n * After working around the product for eleven months, I was not impressed with it. It's helpful, but seems stop-gap. Feel free to open up a trial account and see for yourself how you feel about it.\r\n\r\n * The product is very enterprise focused. You have to buy it in one-year contract terms. This upsets me because I'd like to use the paid product, but there's almost no way I'm going to sign a year-long contract to do that. You may or may not like enterprise-centric businesses, so keep in mind that in mind.\r\n\r\n * All in all, it's the dishonesty that kills me. There are a lot of unhappy employees at ThousandEyes but they haven't left because of the difficulties in switching jobs over VISAs, or because they are in the greencard process. There are a lot of happy employees too, but I found that more of them had not had much prior work experience. It is my experience that there are many better companies in the area and in the US as a whole that you can work at. Places where the business is honest to its customers, where employees hear each other out, and where innovation is a bit more sensible. It's not a bad company, but it's not really good either. While there are many glowing reviews here, I recommend that you move along to a better place until there are significant changes at ThousandEyes. If some day they start openly sharing about their outages (and not other company's outages, which they use for publicity) and bugs, it may be a good sign things have changed. I do feel a bit attached and I like the company in many ways, but it has a long way to go, and unfortunately a lot of that work starts at the top.",

If this comes up without newlines, pipe this through sed replacing * with two newlines. ThousandEyes is a pretty small company and to some it may be obvious who I am. In the interest of an open and honest review, hopefully to your benefit, I will not try to be overly generic. I'd also like to focus a bit more on the positives. I am a former employee and I was there for eleven months. In my absense there have been some positive changes from what I hear.\r\n\r\n * The founders are tech savvy and sharp. Mohit gives good speeches. Ricardo is a bit of a networking wizard.\r\n\r\n * The food is great. There are off days here and there, but they make a great effort to have good catered food.\r\n\r\n * The office management staff is phenomenal. I miss a particularly warm smile every time I came into the office, possibly one of the best parts of my day.\r\n\r\n * Generous stock options.\r\n\r\n * I was once skeptical about pay, but it seems to be on par. You could probably make more at a non-startup, but either way you won't be making much with the insane cost of living in San Francisco. (50k in a normal city will offer a better quality of life than 100k in SF)\r\n\r\n * Business is doing great: The customer list is incredible, as is the growth.\r\n\r\n * Very fun offsites here and there. Overall, there's a decent community element between the employees.\r\n\r\n * Interesting technical challenges. A lot of the problems ThousandEyes faces are somewhat unique, both internally and intrinsically imposed. I had some pretty interesting things to do while I was there. There were some dumb grunt workish jobs at times, but overall I was given a good bit of flexibility. I would propose writing an in-house solution and work on it all on my own at times, rather than be forced to use something out of the box that didn't quite fit.\r\n\r\n * There's a high bar for code in some parts of the company. While it's annoying at times, I feel I really learned a lot by having such high standards put on what I was doing.",

You are quite likely reading this as someone outside of the US and may not know what a J1 is. If you don't, please read up on J1 VISAs. ThousandEyes will generally submit an application for an H1B VISA. Unfortunately, the process sucks and many people don't get accepted. What's sketchy is that they follow it up with a J1 VISA application if the H1B VISA doesn't go through. H1B is for workers, J1 is very explictly for interns at most. ThousandEyes had had one intern in all of my time there, the rest were clearly full time employees. The J1 VISA employees at ThousandEyes often have to fill out forms saying what they learned. These are things they probably learned ten years ago. While immigration is difficult in the US, I say this because you need to be aware that there is a chance (I am not a lawyer) than if you are sponsored on a J1 VISA for a non-intern position in ThousandEyes, you are doing something illegal (as would be ThousandEyes). Furthermore, there's a chance that ThousandEyes, if busted, might send you back home with a very difficult time immigrating in the future. Maybe in this political climate that will never happen, I don't know. But new recruits are not told this as far as I know, and you should know because it may be a huge risk. If you are from abroad, please read up on US immigration, J1 VISAs, and H1B VISAs. One last thing. If you do come in on an H1B VISA, salary information is public. You can go online and search for the salaries of many of the ThousandEyes staff. Maybe you don't want to do this, that's fine. But you should be told because it is public and thus no secret. You can do the same thing for Google, Facebook, etc, if you want to.\r\n\r\n * Not a very organic culture, discussions about the product often end up being told to go to off-topic areas. In particular, the VP of engineering will shoot down these conversations, but several in engineering are not very open minded. All in all, the culture at the dining table is pretty good, but when it comes to working it's not always the greatest mix.\r\n\r\n * The engineering staff is a huge mix of cultures. Most people speak English as a second language. This is very nice for diversity, but there are some obvious communication difficulties. All and all, cultural differences seem to be handled quite well. I've made some great friends there. Still, communication can be difficult.\r\n\r\n * Sales is in the same office and rarely stays around engineering for happy hours and such. There's a little bit of tension over their distance.Sales rarely stick around for lunch. Their turnover rate is very, very high (many gone in 3 months).\r\n\r\n * While this may or may not be exactly true, many of the engineers have more education than experience. While this is not a problem in and of itself, there are some narrow minds there that take a while to open up. I would advise that they emphasize more on experience in the future, rather than pulling in PHD students without professional experience.\r\n\r\n * After working around the product for eleven months, I was not impressed with it. It's helpful, but seems stop-gap. Feel free to open up a trial account and see for yourself how you feel about it.\r\n\r\n * The product is very enterprise focused. You have to buy it in one-year contract terms. This upsets me because I'd like to use the paid product, but there's almost no way I'm going to sign a year-long contract to do that. You may or may not like enterprise-centric businesses, so keep in mind that in mind.\r\n\r\n * All in all, it's the dishonesty that kills me. There are a lot of unhappy employees at ThousandEyes but they haven't left because of the difficulties in switching jobs over VISAs, or because they are in the greencard process. There are a lot of happy employees too, but I found that more of them had not had much prior work experience. It is my experience that there are many better companies in the area and in the US as a whole that you can work at. Places where the business is honest to its customers, where employees hear each other out, and where innovation is a bit more sensible. It's not a bad company, but it's not really good either. While there are many glowing reviews here, I recommend that you move along to a better place until there are significant changes at ThousandEyes. If some day they start openly sharing about their outages (and not other company's outages, which they use for publicity) and bugs, it may be a good sign things have changed. I do feel a bit attached and I like the company in many ways, but it has a long way to go, and unfortunately a lot of that work starts at the top.",

        "pros": "I've edited my review to try and make it more useful. Glassdoor may not support newline separation. If this comes up without newlines, pipe this through sed replacing * with two newlines. ThousandEyes is a pretty small company and to some it may be obvious who I am. In the interest of an open and honest review, hopefully to your benefit, I will not try to be overly generic. I'd also like to focus a bit more on the positives. I am a former employee and I was there for eleven months. In my absense there have been some positive changes from what I hear.\r\n\r\n * The founders are tech savvy and sharp. Mohit gives good speeches. Ricardo is a bit of a networking wizard.\r\n\r\n * The food is great. There are off days here and there, but they make a great effort to have good catered food.\r\n\r\n * The office management staff is phenomenal. I miss a particularly warm smile every time I came into the office, possibly one of the best parts of my day.\r\n\r\n * Generous stock options.\r\n\r\n * I was once skeptical about pay, but it seems to be on par. You could probably make more at a non-startup, but either way you won't be making much with the insane cost of living in San Francisco. (50k in a normal city will offer a better quality of life than 100k in SF)\r\n\r\n * Business is doing great: The customer list is incredible, as is the growth.\r\n\r\n * Very fun offsites here and there. Overall, there's a decent community element between the employees.\r\n\r\n * Interesting technical challenges. A lot of the problems ThousandEyes faces are somewhat unique, both internally and intrinsically imposed. I had some pretty interesting things to do while I was there. There were some dumb grunt workish jobs at times, but overall I was given a good bit of flexibility. I would propose writing an in-house solution and work on it all on my own at times, rather than be forced to use something out of the box that didn't quite fit.\r\n\r\n * There's a high bar for code in some parts of the company. While it's annoying at times, I feel I really learned a lot by having such high standards put on what I was doing.",

These agents are available for general use by all ThousandEyes customers and are a tool to better monitor and troubleshoot your Webex performance. For more information about the key value of these agents, see the Webex Monitoring solution page.\n\nSee this article for best practices on how to set up tests with Webex Cloud Agents for Webex Meetings.\n\nThe agents available for Meetings data centers are:\n\nTable 1.

By utilizing robust telemetry data and AI-native technology, customers can now achieve digital resilience and transition from reactive to proactive operations by assuring user digital experience across domains for both owned and unowned environments.\n\n“A majority of outages are caused by operator error. To empower our customers to achieve digital resilience, we harness more than 650 billion daily measurements and utilize the power of AI across the global area network to go beyond human-scale operations,” said Jonathan Davidson, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Cisco Networking. “Digital Experience Assurance powered by ThousandEyes enables proactive, automated event remediation and can even correlate configuration histories across owned infrastructure and your public cloud infrastructure with experiences, which can mean the difference between a 4-hour outage and a 4-minute disruption.”\n\nOrganizations are competing in a digital landscape where brand reputation, revenue, and employee productivity depend on consistently delivering exceptional digital experiences to every user, everywhere, every time. In tandem, businesses have undergone key shifts that increase reliance on unowned infrastructure and environments, introducing exponential complexity for IT and networking teams that now face the challenge of providing exceptional digital experiences across enterprise, Internet, and cloud networks.\n\nCisco ThousandEyes collects and processes billions of daily measurements from both customer owned and unowned networks. It provides automated insights, proactive recommendations, and closed-loop operations tailored to customers. Now powering Digital Experience Assurance for Cisco Networking Cloud, ThousandEyes ingests device and telemetry data from across Cisco networking platforms, including Meraki and Catalyst. Leveraging AI, ThousandEyes surfaces insights and recommendations, and automatically feeds them to customers’ domain controllers and management systems. According to a commissioned Total Economic Impact™ study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Cisco, a composite organization representative of interviewed ThousandEyes customers reported a significant improvement in IT productivity and user experience. Mean time to resolution (MTTR) of issues decreased by 50-80%, and IT team productivity increased by more than 50%.\n\nThousandEyes Digital Experience Assurance already delivers AI-native assurance capabilities across Cisco Networking, including AI radio resource management (RRM) for Cisco Catalyst wireless, capacity planning for Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN, and device profiling with AI-based signatures for Cisco Identity Services Engine.\n\nToday’s announcements include:\n\nThousandEyes Cloud Insights extends end-to-end visibility deep into public cloud environments by providing topological mappings of its customers’ AWS environments, including service connectivity, configuration changes, and traffic characteristics. By correlating cloud infrastructure and services with user experience, application health, and end-to-end network paths, ThousandEyes delivers deep insight for network, SRE, and cloud operations teams, so they can rapidly identify and resolve their most challenging issues.\n\nThousandEyes Traffic Insights extends ThousandEyes visibility deeper into on-premises networks by collecting and correlating traffic flows with its synthetics measurements, enabling customers to rapidly detect performance issues and pinpoint them to real traffic bottlenecks and anomalies within their networks. By providing a unified view of external and internal network conditions, customers can streamline their operational workflows and reduce their mean time to identify (MTTI) and remediate issues—regardless of whether they own the network or not. ThousandEyes will support flow collection for both Cisco and non-Cisco networking platforms.\n\nThousandEyes Endpoint Experience is now enriched with Meraki Wi-Fi and Local Area Network (LAN) telemetry and device information, enabling customers to gain deeper insight into local network issues impacting user experience.\n\nMeraki Assurance Overview is now powered by ThousandEyes Internet and SaaS visibility, empowering customers with insight into performance beyond their Meraki Wi-Fi and LAN environment to rapidly pinpoint issues across owned and unowned domains.\n\nSupporting Comments\n\n“Worker productivity and customer satisfaction are top-ranked strategic business priorities for organizations of all sizes, industries, and regions. It is imperative for IT organizations to deliver consistently positive digital experiences to both employees and customers. The challenge is these digital experiences are determined by an increasingly complex technology infrastructure where networks, data centers, cloud services, security mechanisms, endpoints, and an ever-growing set of data and applications must all work in concert. Factor in the accelerating use of external systems and services within the infrastructure and further complications arise in measuring, managing, and, ultimately, delivering an overarching positive digital experience to all. The industry needs simpler,\" said Mark Leary, Director, Network Observability and Automation, IDC. \"The industry needs smarter. Comprehensive data collection and cross-domain data correlation, driven by applied intelligence and embedded automation, stands to have a dramatic impact on IT engineering and operations as well as business execution and outcomes.”\n\n\"Experiencing our modern, timeless, and artisan-crafted home furnishings is incredibly important. So when we moved from in-person showrooms to virtual environments, one of our biggest challenges was to make sure customers could have the same great in-person experience, but remotely,” said Mark Rodrigue, Senior Network Engineer, Room & Board. “Being able to see and manage the Internet environments we now leverage to connect with our customers has been a game changer for our ability to assure performance. Before using ThousandEyes, it could take us days to understand where an issue was occurring, but now, we’ve seen a 96% improvement in our response time—and that’s been a game-changer for both fixing issues and working with the cloud and Internet service providers that we rely on.”\n\nAdded Resources\n\nBlog: Entering the New Era of Digital Experience Assurance Across Every Network\n\nBlog: It’s Time to Take Control of Experiences and Transform Infrastructure Operations for AI\n\nPress Release: Cisco Reveals Nexus HyperFabric AI Clusters, A New Simplified Data Center Infrastructure Solution with NVIDIA for Generative AI\n\nAbout Cisco\n\nCisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide technology leader that securely connects everything to make anything possible.

That's because it has a broad, end-to-end view of every user and any application over any network.\n\nFounded 15 years ago, the company says it's been investing lots into AI in the past several years.\n\nBut now, ThousandEyes is making big, AI-focused changes to its platform aimed at giving its client base even more visibility over network quality and resilience.\n\nJoe Vaccaro, vice president and general manager of ThousandEyes, said DXA would provide the ability \"not only to resolve issues before they begin to impact my users, but leverage broad data to actually begin to predict and give forward intelligence on what might happen across infrastructure, to proactively address it before it begins to significantly degrade overall digital experiences.\"\n\n\"Digital experience assurance helps to build upon this evolutionary journey beyond metrics, beyond monitoring, towards a platform that delivers on a closed loop system,\" Vaccaro told CNBC in an exclusive interview.\n\nAmong the other capabilities, DXA comes with are the ability for businesses to correlate, analyze, diagnose, predict, optimize, and remediate with little or no manual intervention.\n\nCisco ThousandEyes says its platform is powered by over 650 billion daily measurements collected from around the globe. The firm committed to giving businesses visibility into their internal environments, including on-premises networks and cloud environments.\n\nThe product builds on Cisco ThousandEyes' Event Detection tech, which the company says already reduces the time taken to detect a disruption event to mere minutes and less staffing, rather than hours and multiple engineers.\n\nAI-generated internet status reports\n\nVaccaro also teased the development of a new product at Cisco ThousandEyes that, once complete, would enable users to generate AI-create scripts showing the status of global ISP (internet service provider), public cloud, and edge service networks, or an application's connection a network.\n\nThis is similar to what ThousandEyes currently offers for internet monitoring, but with AI automatically doing the work rather than people.\n\n\"That is in development and should be seeing the light of day here in the very, very near future,\" Vaccaro told CNBC.\n\nThe product would incorporate large language models, which are considered the bedrock of generative AI systems like ChatGPT and Google Gemini.\n\nRacking up 100 million users to date, ChatGPT was catapulted into global virality just months after its creator OpenAI released it. The app's success stoked massive hype around artificial intelligence, with companies of all stripes making developments of their own in the space.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct the day of the announcement.",
