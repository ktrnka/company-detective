To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law and in the interest of resolving disputes between You and Abridge in the most expedient and cost effective manner, You and Abridge agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration, unless You are located in a jurisdiction that prohibits the exclusive use of arbitration for dispute resolution.\n\nArbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this Agreement. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND Abridge ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. ‍\n\n(b) Opt-Out of Agreement to Arbitrate. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by contacting legal@abridge.com within 30 days of first accepting this Agreement and stating that you (include your first and last name, and email address used to register for the Abridge Platform) decline this arbitration agreement.‍\n\n(c) Exceptions. Despite the provisions of Section 15(a), nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either Party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.‍\n\n(d) Arbitrator. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any arbitration between You and Abridge will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Abridge.‍\n\n(e) Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice”). Abridge’s address for Notice is: Abridge AI, Inc., 500 Grant Street, Suite 2900, Pittsburgh, PA 15219. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The Parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the Parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, You or Abridge may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by You or Abridge must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in Your favor, Abridge will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Abridge in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.‍\n\n(f) Fees. If You commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Abridge will reimburse You for Your payment of the filing fee, unless Your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location, to be agreed upon, in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, You may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of Your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, You agree to reimburse Abridge for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.‍\n\n(g) No Class Actions. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND Abridge AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both You and Abridge agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, to the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law.‍\n\n(h) Claims. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, no action arising out of, in connection with, or relating to this Agreement shall be brought by You more than one (1) year after the accrual of the cause of action. This period shall not be extended for any reason, except by the written consent of both parties. All statutes or provisions of law which would toll or otherwise affect the running of the period of limitation are hereby waived, and no such statute or provision of law shall operate to extend the period limited in this paragraph, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.\n\n(a) Governing Law; Venue. To the fullest extent permitted pursuant to applicable law, these Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Pennsylvania without regard to conflict of law principles. If a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under this Agreement, then You and Abridge agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for the purpose of litigating any dispute.\n\n(b) International Users. We operate the Platform from locations within the United States. The Platform is intended for Users located within the United States. We make no representation that the Platform or Abridge Technology is appropriate or available for use outside of the United States. Access to the Platform from countries or territories or by individuals where such access is illegal is strictly prohibited.\n\n(c) Independent Contractors. The Parties are independent contractors. This Agreement does not establish any relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency between You, Abridge, and neither Party nor any third party will have the power to act on the other Party’s behalf without the other Party’s prior written consent.‍\n\n(d) Assignment. No Party shall have the right to assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, or any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the other Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), except that Abridge may assign this Agreement without consent as part of a corporate reorganization, reorganization, or upon a change of control, consolidation, merger, or transfer of all or substantially all of its business related to this Agreement, whether by sale of stock or assets, operation of law, or otherwise. Any attempted assignment or delegation in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.‍\n\n(e) Force Majeure. Except for the obligation to pay money, no Party will be liable for any failure or delay in its performance under this Agreement due to any cause beyond its reasonable control, including acts of war, acts of God, labor shortages or disputes, pandemics, governmental acts or failure or degradation of the Internet or telecommunications services. The delayed Party will give the other Party prompt notice of such cause, and will make commercially reasonable efforts to promptly correct such failure or delay in performance.\n\n(f) Severability; Waiver; Entire Agreement. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision shall be modified so as best to accomplish the original intent of the Parties to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in effect. The waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior understandings and agreements.‍\n\n(g) Promotion. Abridge may include Your name and logo in lists of Abridge’s customers, solely to identify You as a user of the Platform and further provided that such customer lists shall not be presented in such a way as to indicate or imply any endorsement by or affiliation with You unless Abridge obtains Your prior written consent.‍\n\n(h) Notices. Except as otherwise set forth herein, all notices under these Terms will be by email or provided by Us by way of the Platform. All notices to Us should be sent to legal@abridge.com. Notices will be deemed to have been duly given the same day in the case of notices provided by us by way of email or the Services.\n\n(i) No Third Party Beneficiary. No person other than the Parties hereto will be entitled to any of the benefits of these Terms or be deemed to acquire any rights hereunder.\n\n(j) Export Compliance. The Abridge Technology may be subject to export laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions. You represent that You are not named on any U.S. government denied-party list. You shall not use the Abridge Technology in violation of any U.S. export law or regulation.",

To give an example, I work in addiction treatment where you have to document group with 10 people. A reasonable chart would be quite short especially if the pt engaged in group positively. Insurance wants a novel and will find any excuse to deny a claim. So the new AI in EMRs will basically fluff out chart notes - it will use 3-4 words where 1 suffices, it will include long summaries of past notes, it will reiterate things from the pt’s history and demographics.\n\nAddiction treatment is probably like many other conditions where you have a problem: if you chart that the person is doing better, insurance will say they don’t need treatment anymore. If you chart that they aren’t doing better, they will say it’s not effective and they don’t need treatment anymore. So you also have to extensively document to somehow prove they still need treatment even though the treatment is working.\n\n#### Comment ID m618qzs with +1 score by [(A313-Isoke, Reddit, 2025-01-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthcare/comments/1huzkou/ai_may_listen_in_on_your_next_doctors_appointment/m618qzs/) (in reply to ID m5wo08c):\nThank you, that's a great example.

I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers. Full HIPAA compliance and patient information is protected.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more!

Things like \"Ask AI\" \\~ your AI personal assistant, ask it to generate documents, split notes, ask billing codes, return your transcript etc, the sky is the limit.\n\nYou can use this over zoom \\~ you'll just have to play audio out loud and it will capture everything quite well.

      "# Post ID 1i3zkte: Best AI Medical Scribe out there? with +4 score by [(doctorgreybc, Reddit, 2025-01-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/emergencymedicine/comments/1i3zkte/best_ai_medical_scribe_out_there/)\n\nHi there, everyone!\n\nI know that lately, there have been many clinical or medical AI scribes showing up, and I know there are many solutions that are coming out into the market. I'm looking for recommendations on the best scribe out there. It's 2025, and I'm looking for something that has evolved over the past years. As you know, new solutions and new AI models are out there in the market, and it seems like performance and also the quality of reasoning have improved significantly. So I think that now is a good time to ask these questions.\n\nI have researched the following:\n\n* Freed AI,\n* Deep Scribe\n* Abridge\n* Wavo Health\n* Tali\n* Suki\n* Heidi Health\n* Mutuo Health\n\nI have actually created free accounts for some of these, and for others, I've booked a demo.\n\nWhat I can say is that most of these are actually quite similar. If anything, I can say that perhaps one of the most important aspects for me was quality, price, and functionality.\n\nFor my short testing, I can say that Freed AI, Wavo Health, and Heidi Health are actually quite performant and quite similar in terms of functionality quality with some extra benefits. I'll cover that later.\n\nAbridge,  Deepscribe and Suki seem to be more like enterprise AI scribes as opposed to more like for private practice. And they seem to be trying to integrate with certain EMRs.\n\nTali and Mutuo Health, as well as Wavo Health, seem to be Canadian companies. Tali uses a Chrome extension, and Mutuo Health is completely not worth trying. The overall UI and functionality are a mess, but it's pretty limited, not intuitive, and seems really basic compared to the other solutions. Wavo Health is one of those that actually strikes a balance between its functionality and it seems to work across devices.\n\nNow, some context -  I'm planning to use it mainly for private practice, and therefore my options are right now between Freed AI, Wavo Health, and Heidi Health. The reason why I completely discarded Tali is because of the way that it works, which is a Chrome extension and I prefer a dedicated solution where I know that everything's stored and is easy to access, as well as a dedicated solution can provide an easy way to edit, which is kind of difficult with Tali.\n\nHas anyone been using any of these solutions for longer? I think so far I'm leaning towards Freed AI or Wavo Health. And I'm trying to decide. The only reason why Heidi Health might not make it in my todo is because the data seems to be processed outside of North America.\n\nHappy to hear your guys' thoughts.

I gave it a try during a shift, and my two comments are:\n\n1. It's nice that it has an app, but all of the different AI scribes have a mobile app nowadays, so I don't think that's a differentiator.\n2. Most of my consultations happen using the desktop computer or the laptop, so I definitely need or prefer something that's on the web. I do see the benefits of having a mobile app, and Wavo also has a mobile app, as well as Heidi or Freed AI. The thing that Clio lacks a lot is their web app; it's completely non-working. You can barely do anything with that. I mean you can only see the information, but good luck editing it and adding more stuff - you cannot even trigger the AI scribe on the web. So I think it's falling behind. The accuracy of the Cleo note is pretty good, it's actually really similar to all the other solutions out there. That's a i guess the only good common the other things is that it just falls short um so far i've been testing Wavo Health, and I think that's the one that I'm sticking for now.\n\nMy top list of best AI medical scribes or clinical scribes or whatever the name that is being used now. I can also see  the term Ambient Scribe is now:\n\n1. Wavo Health\n2. Freed AI\n3.

Being honest, I think I'm sticking with Wavo Health - one of the best solutions that I have tested. You can try it for free. It has all the other functionality as the other ones: you can create your custom templates, you can even has an AI Insights where you can ask anything about related to the encounter and even related to the patient if needed. You can assign the notes in patient folders or assign it to a patient, and you can get a quick glance on an overview of all the insight for from all the different encounters that I had with the patient.

I’m testing Wavo for 2 weeks almost on a daily and I can say that hands down Wavo Health is the best ambient medical scribe out there in terms of pricing, ease of use and functionality.\n\nWavo Health has something that have never seen elsewhere which is “clinical insights” it seems to be like is a trained AI on healthcare databases and up to date info that provides insights and suggestion based on the encounter and I can literally ask anything about the patient from previous encounters and it will give me the key insights or a response to my question.

For context, we are an integrated clinic with a focus on primary care and mental health.  \n  \nOur main criteria for evaluation were quality, security and easiness to use and roll out, but we looked at other factors as part of the trial (customization of notes, learning curve, speed and more).  \n  \nWe identified about 7 different solutions and shortlisted 3 based on various factors - mostly based on their public documentation or support centers but also discussion in this community. We then ran an actual trial for all three of the shortlisted options. The seven we looked at initially are: Suki, DAX, Deepscribe, Nabla, Twofold Health, Freed AI, Heidi Health.  \n  \nThe three solutions we trialed were Twofold Health, Freed and Heidi. All good solutions, each has its pros and cons:  \n  \nTwofold Health:   \n\\- Easy to use and setup: intuitive UI made the rollout easy  \n\\- Accuracy was very good. They offer the ability to create customized note templates for specific needs. They also provide system template you can reuse easily.  \n\\- Quick note processing times - average of about 20 seconds.  \n\\- Customer support VERY responsive.  \n\\- Good price point   \n\\- One time it added something we didn't talk about in the assessment section (it was clinically relevant and we should have talked about it, but still..)  \n\\- Do not offer an option to email the patient letter directly to the client.  \n\\- Probably a younger company  \n  \nHeidi  \n\\- Ability to create custom note templates . Was a bit challenging at first but eventually I was able to create a good template.  \n\\- \"Ask Heidi\" feature where you can essentially  send it a prompt and get answer (this was not part of our evaluation criteria but it was pretty cool). Helps with coding  \n\\- A lot of good resources on security and privacy  \n\\- Interface a bit \"all over the place\" -not as simple and intuitive as the other options  \n\\- A bit hard to use on mobile and tablet  \n\\- I was able to get it to hallucinate a in the assessment and plan sections a couple of times. It added information that was not discussed.  \n  \nFreed AI  \n\\- Simple and rather intuitive UI   \n\\- Easy to use mobile app (not a must for us, but was nice nonetheless)  \n\\- System claims to learn your style over time. I saw minor improvements during the trial, but perhaps it needs more learning time.  \n\\- Higher price point (more than double of others)  \n\\- Offer only SOAP format. No ability to create your own templates.  \n\\- Sometimes notes take time to process. Especially at peak times . There was one time it took over 5 minutes to generate.  \n  \n  \nWe ended up going with Twofold. It ticked off most of the boxes, and we were super happy with their support team. But all three solutions were quite impressive.  \n  \nPersonally I'm super excited about AI scribes and I feel like we are just scratching the surface of capabilities. In any case, I hope this helps!\n\n## Comment ID m7y98j8 with +1 score by [(Snoo-9266, Reddit, 2025-01-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/emergencymedicine/comments/1i3zkte/best_ai_medical_scribe_out_there/m7y98j8/) (in reply to ID 1i3zkte):\nThere’s one thing I think you should look for in these apps in addition to the base functionality of AI scribe and that is allowing you to fine tune your note. \nSome apps call it smart edit while others call it custom templates. \nThese allow you to give the AI hints or instructions on what really matters to you and how you want it to create the notes. \nThis saves a ton of time in editing. \n\nI’ve been using Twofold which is not on your list with a custom template that was shared with me using a link and it’s really good.\n\n### Comment ID m8p66gn with +1 score by [(doctorgreybc, Reddit, 2025-01-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/emergencymedicine/comments/1i3zkte/best_ai_medical_scribe_out_there/m8p66gn/) (in reply to ID m7y98j8):\nHey, thanks for sharing your experience with Twofold! Custom templates and smart editing are such a game-changer—like, they save so much time by making the notes fit exactly what you need. I’ve tried a few AI scribes, and honestly, **Twofold seems a lot like Freed AI to me** (which, I’m not even sure if that’s a good thing or kinda concerning? **It feels like a straight-up copycat.** Same colors, same design, same layout with the patients on the side, even the way the notes are structured—subjective, objective, all that. Same way you can copy the whole note or just individual sections. It’s like… almost identical? I don’t know what to say, haha). The only real difference I see is the custom templates, which Freed doesn’t do yet.\n\nBut yeah, I’m still sticking with WAVO Health for now. It’s just… different, you know? It’s not just about transcribing or templates. Like, you can literally ask WAVO anything about the encounter, and it’ll give you an answer with references back to the transcript. It’s like having a second brain that actually *gets* what happened during the visit. Plus, it can handle stuff like scanned PDFs or Word docs, and it works on pretty much any device. For me, those extra features make WAVO stand out.\n\nTotally agree though—custom templates and smart editing are a must for any AI scribe. It’s cool to see more tools adding that. Anyway, thanks for sharing your thoughts on Twofold! Always interesting to hear how different tools compare.\n\n## Comment ID m85aar7 with +1 score by [(ED-Scribe-AI, Reddit, 2025-01-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/emergencymedicine/comments/1i3zkte/best_ai_medical_scribe_out_there/m85aar7/) (in reply to ID 1i3zkte):\nIf you’re using it just for the Emergency Department, I would recommend giving our solution a try. \n\nIt’s completely customizable, including up to 15 of your custom physical exams.

I see you can also select different transcription models from Wispr or Pro Record, which I guess is their own model. The thing that I didn't like is that it didn't produce a good clinical note, and it crashed on my side. I think because it's using a bunch of resources from my computer because I can see that it is transcribing in real-time, which actually Wavo Health does as well, but this one seems to be laggy after a certain time. Otherwise, nice animations, but it still just looks nice and cool, but uh, it doesn't provide the functionality.

ScribeEMR has been awarded Best in KLAS for Virtual Scribe Services for two consecutive years (2024 and 2025). We offer US-based virtual scribes and our AI platform, ScribeRyte AI, which has been proven to be 99.5% accurate. \n\nIf you're looking for a reliable and high-quality AI scribe solution, I'd be happy to provide more information or answer any questions you might have. Some of these other platformed mentioned in here are excellent, but where ScribeRyte AI stands out is our ability to customize the platform to work with each and every provider's unique templates and style. There's a team that works with you throughout the life of your account with ScribeRyte AI, and it's not just an app that you download from the app store and you're on your own. We really put our providers in a position for success.\n\nAlso, another huge advantage that we have is that we can actually pair our AI platform with a live scribe. So if you're with some software that makes you copy and paste notes, which is currently a necessary part of this if you're using a niche EHR that isn't integrated with anything yet... the scribe can scrub your notes and place them directly into your EHR without you having to do that extra work. \n\nWe're currently integrated with Epic, eClinicalWorks, AthenaHealth, Cerner and PrognoCIS EHRs. And we're always working on our next batch of EHR integrations.-\n\nFeel free to reach out!

My primary goal is to offload administrative tasks and streamline workflows to give providers more time to focus on patient care and ultimately improve health outcomes.\n\nWith the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI scribing has gained significant traction. Numerous products are now available to assist with clinical documentation. For those who have integrated these tools into their practice, I’d love to hear your experiences:\n\n1. **Reliability**: Have the AI scribing tools proven reliable enough for you to trust them in your daily practice?\n2. **Missing Features**: What key features do you feel are lacking in the current offerings?\n3. **Integration**: Many providers emphasize the importance of EHR integration. How effectively have these integrations saved you time and streamlined your workflow?\n4. **Impact on Patient Care**: Have you observed any changes, whether positive or negative, in patient care or your interactions with patients since adopting AI scribing tools?\n5. **Training and Support**: How would you rate the training and support provided for these tools? Are there any additional resources or improvements that you believe would be helpful?\n\nI am here not to promote a specific product, but rather to learn about what works well and what falls short.

Human transcriber reviews notes, it takes quite a while for the notes to come back.  Human editors are quite apparent in the note quality.  \n\nFreed - a real AI service.  Quick and efficient.  Almost no features, but it doesn't need much.  Often includes what I saw as if the patient says it, not great.\n\nHeidi - almost perfect.  Like actually almost perfect, out of the box.  The phrasing in notes is terse and \"medical\" without excessive verbosity.  The generation is A+ with great settings on variability.  Hallucination rate is low, context understanding is unsettlingly high.  Only caveat is the website is a little heavy, can be a touch slow on a tablet or phone.\n\nWhat's missing...not much.  Heidi gets it good.  Integration in EMR maybe, but copy and paste works great.  I would have a hard time doing better than Heidi and I say this as a software engineer with very high standards.\n\nNote that all notes require careful review.  These models do occasionally misinterpret and hallucinate.  Of note, if Heidi gets it wrong, you can easily regenerate the note and it will often do a better job, which is nice.\n\nThe hallucination in Heidi is really interesting.  Sometimes it will hallucinate something into the A&P that we didn't talk about which is clinically relevant and we SHOULD have talked about.  A couple times I've called the patient in the evening to talk about it, even.  Go figure. Wouldn't have expected it to be a clinical decision informer but sometimes it is.  Frankly I kinda enjoy going through the notes, it's an interesting second opinion and review of the visit.\n\nI don't mean to rain on your parade but this is the truth.\n\nThe next untouched AI tool is something to query the medical record, \"has patient X ever been tested for hepatitis\" or \"has anyone tried to find out why their alkaline phosphatase is high.\" Or using AI to navigate MIPS and insurance prior auths.\n\n### Comment ID l8cmrab with +13 score by [(DrMo-UC, Reddit, 2024-06-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8cmrab/) (in reply to ID l8cg6pn):\n>The next untouched AI tool is something to query the medical record, \"has patient X ever been tested for hepatitis\" or \"has anyone tried to find out why their alkaline phosphatase is high.\"\n\nIt's the only AI tool I need for which actually doesn't even have to be AI.\n\n#### Comment ID l8ff9vl with +3 score by [(MarcoGalletti, Reddit, 2024-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8ff9vl/) (in reply to ID l8cmrab):\nHi OP, I would not say that it is untouched.

In my experience, LLMs \\_want\\_ to give you this information and you have to carefully craft your prompt to have it withhold this information. The idea being that the AI scribe is to summarize the conversation into clinical notes and not offer clinical decision support. But, clearly it's an area where AI, in general, not just LLMs can deliver.\n\n> The next untouched AI tool is something to query the medical record, \"has patient X ever been tested for hepatitis\" or \"has anyone tried to find out why their alkaline phosphatase is high.\"\n\nWould this be physician led or surfaced by the software, in your opinion?\n\n#### Comment ID l8exz11 with +2 score by [(grey-doc, Reddit, 2024-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8exz11/) (in reply to ID l8ex83x):\nThe Heidi templates are prompts which are crafted to avoid this hallucination but it still leaks through sometimes.

The integration is a huge time saver. Not having to copy/paste saves a lot of time. Overall, the AI quality is good, and I like the AVS that it generates as a patient-level recap of the visit. The only issue has been needing to recap the visit at the end for a more accurate A&P. I like to do it in the room, but often, the patient constantly interrupts with comments that may or may not be related. It has captured some diagnoses or topics for the plan. I remember we talked about them in the room but forgot to write them down, so that has been good. There are rare hallucinations in the notes. More it is that the AI includes small topics that the patient mentioned, but I don't feel they are worth having in the notes.\n\n  \nThe biggest AI need, however, is software to OCR the digital PDF archives, combine them with the CareEverywhere documentation and clinic documentation, and create a nice patient overview.\n\n### Comment ID l8eybd2 with +2 score by [(markatdaily, Reddit, 2024-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8eybd2/) (in reply to ID l8diu3i):\n> The only issue has been needing to recap the visit at the end for a more accurate A&P.

They perform the same way every single time. Crash some but not horrible. The problem is, consistently mediocre is still mediocre. They do reliable listen and transcribe - I cannot say much bad about this. They are accurate in simply getting conversation into the program. \n\nOne major problem for me is syntax. The end result is written in a way that I don’t find attractive or natural. Feels more bulky. Too wordy. “The patient” over and over. Tries to use big words that are never used in an HPI. Just seems forced. Although information is correct, it comes across in a way I don’t like and I’m too anal to leave it. Sometimes wont filter out information. Throws an entire paragraph about the patients ski trip last year that is irrelevant to current complaint of gout. \n\nIntegration is key. Proof and edit is going to be needed. But if it takes multiple steps or another program to access the AI generated information, then it’s not saving you as much time as it promises. Just more clicks to copy paste and so forth. In my opinion any program that doesn’t integrate directly into your note is useless in my opinion. \n\nKeying up orders would be helpful but take some work. Would never be perfect. I would like more ability to edit the product to be something closer to how I prefer to write. \n\nImpact on patient care? So far for me…more eye contact. That’s about it. \n\nTraining should be focused on teaching users what words and phrases to use to help the program out. To help get the right information into the exam vs the assessment and plan. To get the right diagnoses etc. The goal should be less editing. The result should be 90% done. But it’s nowhere close for me personally. \n\nThese have potential, but we are a long ways away from where they’ll have to be to be used widely across specialties, doc, systems, etc. \n\nFor the record, my experience is with DAX.\n\n### Comment ID l8cf8jc with +9 score by [(grey-doc, Reddit, 2024-06-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8cf8jc/) (in reply to ID l8cbx7u):\nTry Heidi with the \"brief\" or \"Goldilocks\" verbosity setting.

I have written a script to anonymize the transcripts, which I then send to chatgpt for note creation. \n\nThe prompt I'm using to create the note is a bit of a work in progress. Overall, it is successful in creating what I need about 95% of the time. It certainly shortens the time I spend writing notes. \n\nHowever, a 5% error rate is still 1 in 20, and I have to review the notes very carefully before finalizing them. \n\nSo far what has not yet been successful is creating an organized task list for the patient in myself for future follow-up. \n\nAnother interesting aspect of my practice, being cash only, is that I have no particular billing or coding requirements, and the structure of my notes has changed dramatically from the soap note that I was taught in residency. My visits are also an hour or more in length, and cover topics ranging from emotional processing to relationships to lab results to longevity studies. \n\nI'm very curious about how a commercial product like Heidi would perform with my very \"non medical\" conversational topics with patients.\n\nSo far the prompt I have crafted and tweaked is doing well at creating a note that I find useful and serviceable. \n\nThe biggest issue is when it misses something that I know I talked about with the patient, and I have to search the transcript to find it.\n\n### Comment ID l8ere5m with +2 score by [(Harvard_Med_USMLE265, Reddit, 2024-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8ere5m/) (in reply to ID l8dpgum):\nWould you be willing to share your prompt?

I might be convinced to pay $20-30 a month for an AI scribe but $100/month is too much, at least when the free alternatives are good enough. \n\nAnyone else using AI scribes, especially ones other than the two I mentioned?

It gives you a gender neutral HPI (i.e. uses \"they/them\" pronouns) as well as mental status exam (I'm in psychiatry) and plan.  The MSE and plan are useless, at least for me. The HPI is decent.\n\nFreed doesn't show you a transcription live but you can access it afterwards. It gives a better HPI than Nabla and you can choose gender so it sounds better than using \"they/them\" all over. It also does a more honest job at the MSE; basically never attempts to write one and says \"not enough objective data.\" It also gives a plan and after visit summary. Both are really solid. Anything you say during the appointment in terms of plan, it'll capture. If I mention diet and exercise, it'll put in specifically what I said rather than just say \"lifestyle changes\". I have a template for plan that I prefer using so I don't actually use that part but I could easily see someone finding it useful (unlike Nabla where I don't think most people would find the generated plan sufficient). The after visit summary is gold though. Writes instructions as a letter from you to the patient, with an easy to read list of what was talked about during the appointment. \n\nIf they cut the price in half, I'd recommend Freed without any doubt. I wouldn't say it's worth a $100 a month though, especially since Nabla is free and the HPI is the main thing you want from an AI anyway, not plan or AVS.\n\n#### Comment ID k20c8mu with +11 score by [(blade24, Reddit, 2023-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k20c8mu/) (in reply to ID k1y3r77):\nWhat are the legal ramifications of these?

I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers. Full HIPAA compliance and patient information is protected.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more! You can also shoot me an email ernest.chan@getathelas.com and I'd be happy to chat more.\n\n## Comment ID k23jy34 with +1 score by [(toastycitrus, Reddit, 2023-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k23jy34/) (in reply to ID 16qm7ji):\nEdit\n\n### Comment ID ki1hlaw with +1 score by [(Emotional_Walrus_782, Reddit, 2024-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/ki1hlaw/) (in reply to ID k23jy34):\nCan actually do this with Heidi.

I’ve been using Suki. It has direct access to my EMR and schedule so it’s as simple as clicking the patients name and starting the “note”. I access it through my phone and leave the phone near the patient and myself. It then processes the ramblings (I can be all over the place sometimes) of the visit and manages to organize it into HPI and a/p VERY accurately and in better detail than what I would normally do without it. It also does physical exam and other things like patient instructions but you’d need to speak out the physical exam which is weird. It has been life changing because it takes away the mental burden of documenting after seeing patients. I often do all my notes at lunch and then after the afternoon session because it allows me to stay on time and focus on the patient.

It has been surprisingly good at taking a rambling patient's complaints and putting together a fairly accurate HPI.  It can also spit out a decent crack at the assessment and plan, however, I am someone who usually adds a bit more detail to the assessment and plan, particularly if there are nuances that I am trying to explain in the note.  DAX tends to output very simple A&Ps like \"Chest pain: check labs\", which is obviously over simplified for a possibly serious complaint, which requires me to go back and edit the suggested note or delete it and write my own.  Also, we have a trash EHR and integration is minimal. I literally have to copy and paste the DAX output into my EHR.   It is also fairly annoying to have to explain to patients that I am using an AI scribe. As you might expect, some patients are very skeptical of this or have privacy concerns.  Right now my organization requires that with each encounter for which we use AI, I am required to disclose to the patient what is happening. However, I imagine that in the future organizations will start to use standardized forms part of the check-in process.  \n\n\n\n\nWith a slight increase in detail/accuracy and better EHR integration, I really could see it making a big improvement in my workflow and efficiency.  At this point, I continue to use it because I feel it is time neutral and as the technology improves, the time savings will improve. \n\n\n\n\nEDIT:  you also asked about the medicolegal risk of the conversations being recorded.  I believe the raw audio is deleted within a short time frame, roughly one month, but would assume that anything you say could hypothetically come up during legal discovery. However, I feel this is the case at baseline, as some patients do record their visits without our knowledge, so I am already assuming that anything I say during a patient encounter could hypothetically be brought up during a lawsuit.\n\n### Comment ID kwu55tb with +2 score by [(Azure340, Reddit, 2024-03-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1bp12do/how_did_nuance_dax_or_other_ai_scribes_affected/kwu55tb/) (in reply to ID kwsuyxr):\nI had the same issue using a different AI medical scribe.\nI ended up creating a software in which i dictate but without the commas and periods etc and it structures it into a soap note using my language.

I have been using DAX with OCHIN Epic in the outpatient setting the last two weeks and it has saved me a significant amount of time. I pre-chart with it. Then during the visit it captures, summarizes and incorporates pertinent HPI information into my previously pre-charted problems. I summarize at the end of my visit our a/p with problem, recommendations and follow up. DAX captures that correctly. My challenge is that it is not integrated yet into the Epic problem list, linking with the appropriate diagnostic codes. I was told last week that is coming in November. In 2025 they are supposed to implement bulleted rather paragraph information option as well, which I prefer. There is definitely some note bloat.

I was skeptical and bailed on the original DAX rollout, but I have been using DAX Copilot integrated with Epic, which has saved me quite a bit of time. I frequently edit extensively and substitute medical terms for the language derived only from the provider-patient conversation. I could cut down on that by dictating the assessment and plan again more concisely in medical terms instead of just relying on that which was expressed in lay terms to the patient. I find it easier at the end of the clinic to edit the output over typing (and not actively listening as well) or recreating info from my scrawled notes. It's good to know about the coming upgrades.

I use it solely for the HPI for the following reasons:\n\n1: I find it mentally exhausting to create a narrative that does not satisfy any metric for reimbursement, is often wrong 1-3 hours later when I cannot remember a detail, and as more patients review their notes that's the thing they focus on ('doc I told you I was in Reno when I sprained my ankle not Vegas').\n\n2. I like formulating the A/P, and it's critical for my follow-up, and DAX imo does not do a good job on this, certainly not better than I can do and it matters most for other docs to follow my logic.\n\nSince starting it I am able to close notes faster for the sheer fact that I do not feel gutted by the chore of dictating an HPI that is often of no clinical value to me since I already know exactly what needs to happen. I do read the HPI from DAX and add details sometimes or correct pronouns.

I can just chat with the patient and let it record whatever the patient is saying and filter it, meanwhile I can just leisurely update the problem list if I have to.\n\nAlso, Abridge understands foreign languages and can make sense out of a non-English/english conversation since when I talk to patients in a language rather than English, we often use English words and terms, so the conversation often becomes a hodgepodge of words - and Abridge can make sense of it MOST of the time. Knows Spanish, Portuguese, Hindu, Russian...\n\nI am honest SUPER impressed with Abridge.\n\nMy wife uses DAX at work and I did not like it at all, I think it is far inferior to Abridge and also like other Nuance products it does not understand accents and produces gibberish. Also DAX can hallucinate stuff. Have not seen Abridge do that.\n\n### Comment ID lwbl7o9 with +1 score by [(AccomplishedCat6621, Reddit, 2024-11-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1ggmdf8/thoughtsexperiences_working_with_ai_scribes/lwbl7o9/) (in reply to ID lus9081):\nare you on Epic?\n\n#### Comment ID m5rw2mu with +3 score by [(durask11, Reddit, 2025-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1ggmdf8/thoughtsexperiences_working_with_ai_scribes/m5rw2mu/) (in reply to ID lwbl7o9):\nYes.\n\n## Comment ID lusajp4 with +8 score by [(nigeltown, Reddit, 2024-11-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1ggmdf8/thoughtsexperiences_working_with_ai_scribes/lusajp4/) (in reply to ID 1ggmdf8):\nHeidi is winning out with me and my colleagues\n\n## Comment ID lus9i8o with +5 score by [(jochi1543, Reddit, 2024-11-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1ggmdf8/thoughtsexperiences_working_with_ai_scribes/lus9i8o/) (in reply to ID 1ggmdf8):\nI just started using Heidi. I’ve always been a fast typer and good at taking notes and never really had any issues with charting. I find that I run it in the background for most interactions, but I only copy/paste from it for maybe 10 to 20% of them because most of the time, my own notes while I’m listening to the patients are a lot more succinct. I find it good for those ADHD type of patients who come in with long lists of complaints and keep jumping for one thing to another. Then I do a light edit to what I pasted from the Scribe. But for the overwhelming majority of interactions, I still find my own notetaking is better. And I’ve been told by staff that I have some of the most thorough and most organized notes of anyone else at the clinic so it’s not like my regular notes are too short or sloppy. \n\nMy colleague who owns the clinic is a massive Heidi devotee. He was thinking of retiring in a year, but now he says with Heidi, he plans to work another five years. I see some of his patients and actually find his notes from Heidi to be way too verbose and long. \n\nSo all in all, if you struggle with typing speed and/or aren’t a good writer, you might find it helpful, especially for certain types of interactions. But otherwise, I found it to be a bit overhyped. But I could see it being excellent for psychiatry notes, for example.\n\n### Comment ID lv4mt4z with +1 score by [(Best_Doctor_MD90, Reddit, 2024-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1ggmdf8/thoughtsexperiences_working_with_ai_scribes/lv4mt4z/) (in reply to ID lus9i8o):\nHow does it compare with Nabla ?\n\n## Comment ID lus6zne with +4 score by [(AmazingArugula4441, Reddit, 2024-11-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1ggmdf8/thoughtsexperiences_working_with_ai_scribes/lus6zne/) (in reply to ID 1ggmdf8):\nWe’re starting Heidi where I am.

But I’m wondering if there are other ways I should be using AI to help both at work and at home?\n\n## Comment ID m9x9k7m with +16 score by [(kidney-wiki, Reddit, 2025-01-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1id7yvc/how_are_you_using_ai_in_medicine_and_in_your/m9x9k7m/) (in reply to ID 1id7yvc):\nAt work I mostly use AI to write messages for cards that get circulated around the office for people's birthdays, weddings, etc.\n\nI put a bunch of textbooks from my specialty into notebookLM.

It saves time with bookkeeping and scheduling, though if I was better with Python that might not be true. \n\nEx: extracting data and placing into a standard format in an excel file or ics. \n\nI use it maybe once a month for something useful. Play around with it about daily but the only things it helps with so far are saving me maybe 1h of time per month?\n\nIn my life, most of the things it can help with are rare events, so even if it simplifies them a lot, it’s a low time savings overall. \n\nI don’t use it for search or learning at all, I think because I’m already quite efficient and finding answers to questions (medical or nonmedical) already. \n\nConversely, I’m also wasting more time indirectly as a result of it. Ex: realizing a search result I started reading is just AI generated garbage. Trying to figure out if students used an LLM to do a write up by reviewing the document revision history. Etc. \n\nI’d like to try an AI-scribe; however it’s not clear that I’m allowed to use them locally based off professional regulations and the potential need to store audio recordings. There’s also issues with needing patient consent, hospital recording policies, IT infrastructure, etc that may limit when we could ever use this. In trialling them, I also didn’t find they save me anytime, though I’d need to use them much more to make sure fluency wasn’t the issue. \n\nI do wonder if the time savings of AI so far are proportional to time spent working on a computer. The people who are in an office online all day seem to experience more time savings potential. \n\nWhen I’m not at work, I’m rarely doing anything important that involves my cell phone or computer. Difficult to add an AI to that workflow as a result. \n\nAlways like hearing new ways that people have found it useful though.\n\n### Comment ID m9yg21j with +3 score by [(sjogren, Reddit, 2025-01-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1id7yvc/how_are_you_using_ai_in_medicine_and_in_your/m9yg21j/) (in reply to ID m9x61ki):\nThere are a number of health systems that have started using AI scribes already.

Different rules. \n\nOur equivalent to HIPAA is not the issue I was referring to. \n\nOur professional body has practice guidelines on use of AI that they published just a few months ago, which require things like active patient consent. \n\nIn addition, we have a single medical-legal insurer for all physicians and they have published “advice” on best practices to follow when using AI. They suggest that storage of audio transcripts of the patient encounter that AI used should be stored in the health record. Among other things. \n\nThere are also somewhat different rules by province - Canadian provinces are closer to independent countries than they are to US states.\n\n## Comment ID m9ywfz5 with +6 score by [(Proper_Parking_2461, Reddit, 2025-01-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1id7yvc/how_are_you_using_ai_in_medicine_and_in_your/m9ywfz5/) (in reply to ID 1id7yvc):\nSharing a review of scribes I shared on a primary care community but relevant here too I guess  \n  \nOur main criteria for evaluation were quality, security and easiness to use and roll out, but we looked at other factors as part of the trial (customization of notes, learning curve, speed and more).  \n  \nWe identified about 7 different solutions and shortlisted 3 based on various factors - mostly based on their public documentation or support centers but also discussion in this community. We then ran an actual trial for all three of the shortlisted options. The seven we looked at initially are: Suki, DAX, Deepscribe, Nabla, Twofold Health, Freed AI, Heidi Health.  \n  \nThe three solutions we trialed were Twofold Health, Freed and Heidi. All good solutions, each has its pros and cons:  \n  \nHeidi  \n\\- Ability to create custom note templates . Was a bit challenging at first but eventually I was able to create a good template.  \n\\- \"Ask Heidi\" feature where you can essentially  send it a prompt and get answer (this was not part of our evaluation criteria but it was pretty cool). Helps with coding  \n\\- A lot of good resources on security and privacy  \n\\- Interface a bit \"all over the place\" -not as simple and intuitive as the other options  \n\\- A bit hard to use on mobile and tablet  \n\\- I was able to get it to hallucinate a in the assessment and plan sections a couple of times. It added information that was not discussed.  \n\n\nTwofold Health:   \n\\- Easy to use and setup: intuitive UI made the rollout easy  \n\\- Accuracy was very good. They offer the ability to create customized note templates for specific needs. They also provide system template you can reuse easily.  \n\\- Quick note processing times - average of about 20 seconds.  \n\\- Customer support VERY responsive.  \n\\- Good price point   \n\\- One time it added something we didn't talk about in the assessment section (it was clinically relevant and we should have talked about it, but still..)  \n\\- Do not offer an option to email the patient letter directly to the client.  \n\\- Probably a younger company\n\n  \nFreed AI  \n\\- Simple and rather intuitive UI   \n\\- Easy to use mobile app (not a must for us, but was nice nonetheless)  \n\\- System claims to learn your style over time. I saw minor improvements during the trial, but perhaps it needs more learning time.  \n\\- Higher price point (more than double of others)  \n\\- Offer only SOAP format. No ability to create your own templates.  \n\\- Sometimes notes take time to process. Especially at peak times . There was one time it took over 5 minutes to generate.  \n  \nWe ended up going with Twofold. It ticked off most of the boxes, and we were super happy with their support team. But all three solutions were quite impressive.  \nPersonally I'm super excited about AI scribes and I feel like we are just scratching the surface of capabilities.\n\n### Comment ID ma62nkp with +1 score by [(Snoo-9266, Reddit, 2025-01-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1id7yvc/how_are_you_using_ai_in_medicine_and_in_your/ma62nkp/) (in reply to ID m9ywfz5):\nYeah I also used a few and came to similar conclusions. \nThe time saving is real and more than that, it prevents me from doing tedious work that I don’t enjoy doing.

Today I asked it for the usual dose of D-mannose and interactions between paxlovid and flecainide. That is typical - I know how to use D-mannose and I was pretty sure the paxlovid was a no go but I want to check myself. My hope is that AI will help reduce my medical errors and also speed me up, because it is much faster to double check things. It’s not always perfect but it does a pretty good job of pulling credible citations for me to read. \nFor writing letters I use ChatGPT. Not very often but it writes a pretty good appeal letter for insurance. \n\nI think in 5 years AI will really speed me up and approach the level of a human scribe, entering orders and entering info into correct tabs and boxes.\n\n## Comment ID m9y5txa with +2 score by [(nicholus_h2, Reddit, 2025-01-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1id7yvc/how_are_you_using_ai_in_medicine_and_in_your/m9y5txa/) (in reply to ID 1id7yvc):\nsystem has Abridge AI scribe. \n\n\ndocumentation is faster and way less stressful. i don't have to remember all of the HPI details anymore, it all of the things we talked about.

I wouldn’t trust AI to do it anyhow. There is much more value in you writing it. As for stats, you still have to know what kind to run whether you use software or program it yourself. Then you are able to run it different ways…like calculating an average score for missing data points or taking them out of the calculation. I think this is an area that AI can’t do, should not do. You’re much better at reviewing journal articles and using critical thinking than AI, I promise you- if I did a paper using AI I would have to review it so finely that it would take more time than just doing it myself. I also think it’s against the rules, and while I can be a rule breaker- this one they will catch on and also research is about the development of knowledge. I wouldn’t want you to be pegged for academic dishonesty. Much better to be done by a human than a computer that takes what is already out there and doesn’t come up with unique ideas or perspectives.

      "# Post ID 17h3wai: AI scribe personal vs institutional use with +11 score by [(Unusual_Moose9741, Reddit, 2023-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/17h3wai/ai_scribe_personal_vs_institutional_use/)\nThe health system I am working for is currently looking at eventually getting a AI scribe software. However, based on past experience, I am not hopeful that this will actually come to fruition anytime soon. One company we are looking at is Abridge, who also offers individual licenses that do not integrate directly with the EMR. Everything is HIPAA compliant and does not require additional hardware. We have been told not to buy our own AI scribe licenses out of concern for security, privacy, etc.  But if the software is not being integrated into the EMR and there is no hardware, I don’t see why it should be an issue. \n\nWhat are your experiences with individual vs system wide AI scribes?\n\n## Comment ID k6lieb9 with +14 score by [(Bruckjo, Reddit, 2023-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/17h3wai/ai_scribe_personal_vs_institutional_use/k6lieb9/) (in reply to ID 17h3wai):\nAn AI scribe has provided an hour to two hours a day to do something other than data entry.

It's the worst out of all the AI scribes. They have to be giving some kickback to organizations because I've seen them go from unknown to being the most talked about option in a matter of a couple weeks. The fact that your organization is making up some BS excuse of \"don't get your own because of reasons\" just solidifies by theory that Abridge is doing something shady to get more market share. Like you said, the software is not integrated into the EMR so no AI scribe is inherently worse than the other, so long as they're all adhering to HIPAA.\n\n### Comment ID k70f4ip with +1 score by [(Unusual_Moose9741, Reddit, 2023-10-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/17h3wai/ai_scribe_personal_vs_institutional_use/k70f4ip/) (in reply to ID k704nnq):\nWhat about it don’t you like?\n\n#### Comment ID k70j5hp with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-10-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/17h3wai/ai_scribe_personal_vs_institutional_use/k70j5hp/) (in reply to ID k70f4ip):\nSo many things. \n\nForces you to use a secondary device. So you have to give it access to all sorts of privacy requests on your iPhone/iPad. Then it's a significantly longer workflow of opening up their website on your phone, waiting for the note to populate, then copy/paying into your EMR. Compared to most AI's where it's just another tab that's sitting in the background. \n\nThe other big issue with Abridge is that they store audio recordings of your appointment. That's an absolute no-go for me. There are massive legal repercussions to that. My patients have consented to a virtual AI scribe. They did not consent to have our appointments recorded and turned over to a for-profit AI company. Not to mention, they're very opaque about what they're going to do with the audio recordings. I strongly suspect that they're going to be using the audio recordings for their own monetization purposes. Frankly, wouldn't surprise me if their business model is actually focused on making use of these audio recordings rather than getting money from the AI scribe aspect itself. \n\nTheir AI scribe itself is also inferior to others out there. Can't even pick gender in your patient notes.\n\n## Comment ID ku6md7w with +2 score by [(ComdrFury, Reddit, 2024-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/17h3wai/ai_scribe_personal_vs_institutional_use/ku6md7w/) (in reply to ID 17h3wai):\nI have tried mpilo (https://mpilo.ai), which looks amazing and quite easy to use. It's also HIPAA compliant and secure. They do not store any data on their servers, everything is stored on the user's device, so you are not dealing with any issues there.

I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nYou can shoot me an email ernest.chan@getathelas.com and I'd be happy to chat more."

Fix it.\n\nLose the \"exclusivity\" mindset. I know it makes you feel important but there are 100s of other companies doing what you're doing.

I reached out to the company to let them know of a medical diagnosis that made this experience particularly distressing and unhealthy for me. They assured me this would be handled according to standard employment law and practices but there was never any further follow up on it.\n\nI tried scheduling meetings with my supervisors for over a month to get clear expectations and make sure the working environment would improve but they kept cancelling. I had no clear expectations for my role, I was being excluded from meetings and was objectively and clearly being treated differently than other people with the same title and role. I had wonderful relationships with my coworkers and other areas of the company but for some reason my specific reporting chain seemed to want me excluded and gone.\n\nAfter over a month of trying to have a conversation with my reporting chain around reasonable accommodations, including clarity of role, expectations for my role, etc. They continually cancelled our scheduled meetings, sending me messages at 2 or 3 am the night before, until I finally gave up and submitted my resignation.\n\nThis is the experience you can expect if you end up in the wrong part of the company.\n\nPay attention to red flags during your interview process. I certainly noticed them (one person showed up 30 minutes late to a 30 minute in-person interview). Listen to your gut when you have significant concerns. They are valid.\n\nWhen you read other reviews that are \"positive\" and about how working here is \"intense\", \"not for everyone\", \"doesn't tolerate even an A- player\", and \"no ego\" think seriously about what these things really mean about the culture.",

While some teams are inclusive and less toxic than others, burnout is a central theme at every level. \n\nPeople don’t trust each other and are afraid to speak up, so slack is filled with shout outs praise, and a ton of self promotion, but if you speak one on one with someone, beneath the surface, people are afraid and miserable.\n\nThe company’s internal motto is to work as fast and as much as possible to win, even at the expense of smart decisions, creativity, individuality, diversity, and most of all - health and wellbeing. Employees are required to give out their personal contact information and much of the demands happen off work channels. Phones are busy with texts and calls throughout all hours of the night and morning and if you put up boundaries, you’re seen as not being passionate enough about the company and its mission.",

However, I choose to remain anonymous to protect my identity. One major challenge we faced was the severe lack of revenue, which put an immense amount of stress on the business as a whole. This financial strain impacted various aspects of the company's operations, contributing to an overall atmosphere of uncertainty. Moreover, a noticeable power struggle was eminent among the top-level executives, which negatively affected decision-making processes and hindered progress. It was disheartening to witness how this internal struggle trickled down and impacted the overall work environment. Regrettably, the company recently resorted to implementing secretive layoffs. Disconcertingly, both employees who had been with the organization for a few months and those with many years of service were affected. This sudden downsizing not only caused disruption but also undermined employee morale, creating a sense of uncertainty and job insecurity among the workforce. Additionally, I observed a steady decline in the people culture within the organization. The once supportive and collaborative atmosphere had deteriorated, leading to a less comfortable and engaging work environment.",

Your feedback is incredibly valuable in helping us understand how we can continuously strive to provide a better experience for all of our current and future employees.\n\nWe know it can be challenging in the early stages of building a product and a company. Given our growth-stage environment, we often wrestle with ambiguity and uncertainty. We know that not everyone thrives under these conditions. For those that do, we enjoy working together to solve big problems, accomplish goals, celebrate successes big and small, and contribute to our growth in meaningful ways.\n\nWe do our best to proactively check our egos so that we can have thoughtful and constructive conversations with one another, always in the best interest of the company’s growth. We believe this practice has helped us evolve quickly and achieve venturesome goals that have gotten us to where we are today, and that will continue to help us grow as we continue to operate in hyper-growth mode.\n\nWhile the company has had the privilege of never having to RIF for financial reasons, it’s never easy to have to say goodbye to a team member, regardless of circumstances. When we do find ourselves in this position, we aim to handle things with great care and compassion because we believe that’s what all of our team members deserve.\n\nThank you again for taking the time to share your feedback.

This financial strain impacted various aspects of the company's operations, contributing to an overall atmosphere of uncertainty. Moreover, a noticeable power struggle was eminent among the top-level executives, which negatively affected decision-making processes and hindered progress. It was disheartening to witness how this internal struggle trickled down and impacted the overall work environment. Regrettably, the company recently resorted to implementing secretive layoffs. Disconcertingly, both employees who had been with the organization for a few months and those with many years of service were affected. This sudden downsizing not only caused disruption but also undermined employee morale, creating a sense of uncertainty and job insecurity among the workforce. Additionally, I observed a steady decline in the people culture within the organization. The once supportive and collaborative atmosphere had deteriorated, leading to a less comfortable and engaging work environment.",

      "# [Abridge Series D Announcement and More](https://www.abridge.com/press-release/series-d)\nAbridge has been deployed in more than 100 health systems, including newly announced Akron Children’s, Endeavor Health, Inova, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and Oak Street Health, a CVS Health company. Within the last eight weeks, Abridge has also announced enterprise-wide implementations at Duke Health, Johns Hopkins, Mayo Clinic, and UNC Health, representing tens of thousands of clinicians.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, CA—February 17, 2025—Abridge, the leading generative AI platform for clinical conversations, has raised a $250 million Series D investment, coinciding with the milestone of surpassing 100 deployments at some of the largest and most complex health systems in the United States. The Series D investment, co-led by Elad Gil and IVP, includes contributions from Bessemer Venture Partners, California Health Care Foundation, CapitalG, CVS Health Ventures, K. Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, NVentures (NVIDIA’s venture capital arm), Redpoint Ventures, Spark Capital, and SV Angel. The investment will fuel additional development of AI capabilities and commercial growth to support broader applications.\n\n\"We are excited about the potential of Abridge’s technology to enhance Inova’s clinical documentation across our care sites,\" said Matt Kull, Executive Vice President, Chief Information and Digital Officer, Inova. \"The quality of specialty-specific notes and Abridge's responsiveness to clinician feedback with rigorously tested enhancements stood out to us. Learning more about the innovation behind the scenes—ensuring notes are both clinically useful and billing compliant—along with the demonstrated ROI at other institutions has been compelling as we explore this solution.\"\n\nAbridge, recently named Best in KLAS for the Ambient AI segment, has also introduced a new Contextual Reasoning Engine—an AI architecture that produces more clinically useful and billable notes at the point of care. Today, healthcare systems are plagued by incomplete clinical notes that delay billing processes, resulting in the loss of countless hours spent improving documents, often weeks or months after a patient visit. Generating comprehensive, billable notes that support appropriate claims at the point of care creates administrative efficiencies, reducing costs and freeing doctors to focus more on patient care. The Abridge Contextual Reasoning Engine enables the following:\n\nContextual awareness beyond the conversation: integrating data from retrospective patient encounters, health system-specific revenue cycle guidelines, and clinician documentation preferences to create more comprehensive, personalized notes.\n\nPrecise problem detection: intelligently recognizing and grouping medical problems, describing them with language that aligns with appropriate billing codes to simplify downstream revenue cycle workflows (integration with Epic’s Diagnosis Awareness Notes under active development as part of Epic’s Workshop program).\n\nActionable outputs: capturing medical orders and integrating them into the electronic health record, ready for clinician review (integration with Epic under active development as part of Epic’s Workshop program).\n\nAuditable notes: tying AI-generated outputs to source information across all input data—powered by Linked Evidence.\n\n“Our health system is remarkable for its scientific and clinical achievements, but also overwhelmed and demoralized by bureaucratic processes, unproductive steps, and tedious labor,” said Somesh Dash, General Partner, IVP. “AI can be transformative by abstracting away the complexity and rules around revenue cycle as it pertains to documentation, allowing clinicians to focus on their patients while getting their documentation right the first time. Abridge is pioneering this effort with leading health systems across the country.”\n\n“The Abridge Contextual Reasoning Engine helps us concentrate more value into our core documentation offering, integrating system and revenue cycle requirements into a sophisticated and orchestrated system of AI models,” said Dr. Shiv Rao, Abridge CEO and Founder. “We aspire to serve our health system partners for the decades to come. This investment supports that aspiration, as well as the core research and development that differentiates our approach.”\n\nAbridge is now implemented at a diverse set of more than 100 of the largest and most complex healthcare systems in the U.S. From rural systems to children's hospitals to leading academic systems and nationally recognized cancer centers, Abridge is used by clinicians of every specialty across all care settings, and in over 28 languages.\n\nAbout Abridge\n\nAbridge was founded in 2018 to power deeper understanding in healthcare. The enterprise-grade AI platform transforms medical conversations into clinically useful and billable documentation at the point of care, reducing administrative burden and clinician burnout while improving patient experience. With deep EHR integration, support for 28+ languages, and 50+ specialties, Abridge is used across a wide range of care settings, including outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient.\n\nAbridge’s enterprise-grade AI platform is purpose-built for healthcare. Supported by Linked Evidence, Abridge is the only solution that maps AI-generated summaries to source data, helping clinicians quickly trust and verify the output. As a pioneer in generative AI for healthcare, Abridge is setting the industry standard for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.",
      "# [How Abridge became one of the most talked about healthcare AI startups by Marina Temkin on 2024-06-18](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/18/how-abridge-became-one-of-the-most-talked-about-healthcare-ai-startups/)\nAsk any of the health-focused VCs to name one of the top AI startups and one name comes up over and over again: a company based in Pittsburgh called Abridge. And it’s a startup that launched before OpenAI was a household name and large language models (LLMs) entered the common Valley vocabulary.\n\nIn 2019, Shiv Rao, a practicing cardiologist, pitched Andy Weissman, general partner at Union Square Ventures (USV), on a startup idea. Rao called it SoundCloud plus RapGenius for medicine.\n\nWhile Weissman thought that comparing a nascent AI-powered medical note-taking app with music hosting and lyrics transcription was a little humorous, the concept resonated with him.\n\nRao explained that doctors spend up to two hours a day — typically outside of regular working hours — typing notes that summarize what was discussed with their patients that day. Such administrative tasks have been causing physician burnout for years, leading some to leave the profession altogether. Rao convinced Weissman that the latest innovations in AI could dramatically reduce the amount of time doctors spend on the ever-growing paperwork burden.\n\nThis was years before generative AI took the world by storm and captured the imagination of VCs.\n\n“It was a pretty wacky idea. No one had done it before,” Weissman said.\n\nBut Weissman and other USV partners liked that Rao was a physician at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and that he spent half his time as a corporate venture capitalist for that health system, investing in health tech startups. Rao’s employees and advisers were also graduates and professors at Carnegie Mellon, one of the top institutions in the country for engineering and AI research.\n\n“[Shiv] had this rare combination of talents: an entrepreneur with a very ambitious vision, with a really interesting team,” Weissman said. “It felt unique.”\n\nAbridge also had a basic transcription product, which doctors could download for free on their smartphones and start using during their interactions with patients. Their usage formed the basis of Abridge’s LLM.\n\nA little over five years after USV led a $5 million seed round into Rao’s startup Abridge, the company has become one of the most talked about and rapidly growing AI-powered healthcare businesses.\n\nAlthough most corporations are still very cautious about adopting AI tools, large medical systems are eager to sign contracts with Abridge.\n\n“The sales cycle for [health systems] can be 18 to 24 months,” said Rao. “When we started the company, we knew what we were in for.” But with a four-year lead on a virtual scribe product trained on thousands of doctor-patient conversations, and now that AI is booming, hospitals are suddenly buying Abridge at a rapid pace, a stark contrast to their typically protracted purchasing behavior. The company has announced a new health system customer nearly every week since the start of 2024.\n\n“We had built up all this potential energy that turned kinetic almost overnight in January,” Rao said. “University of Chicago, Sutter, Yale, Lee Health, Christus, Emory and the list goes on and on,” he said.\n\nLarge hospitals are not only buying multi-thousand seat licenses of Abridge but also, in many cases, publishing glowing reviews about how the health tech’s software is changing physicians’ lives. Hospital executives and doctors are describing Abridge as “life-changing,” “magical,” and “one of the most important paradigm shifts within our careers.”\n\nOne of the biggest criticisms of generative AI is that it still has few substantive business applications. But virtual medical note taking seems to be a valuable application of the novel technology.\n\nDrowning in paperwork\n\n“I’ve got professional PTSD and war stories about seeing patients and then having to spend hours and hours at night writing notes and doing all this clerical work that really distracts from the thing that matters most, which is your patient, but also takes away from your own personal life,” Rao said.\n\nWith Abridge recording in the background, a physician can focus entirely on the patient without having to worry about filling out specific fields in the medical record during the visit.\n\nThe payback of AI-powered medical scribes is very easy to measure, says Dr. Lee Schwamm, chief digital health officer at Yale New Haven Medical System, an Abridge customer. That’s why so many health systems are flocking to use them, particularly Abridge. “It is one of the hottest products in the AI space at the moment,” he told TechCrunch.\n\nAs with many administrative things in health tech, when it comes to selecting a vendor, the most important consideration is price and integration with Epic, an electronic health records system used by most large health systems in the U.S., Schwamm said. Abridge, which supports 14 foreign languages, including Haitian Creole, Brazilian Portuguese and Punjabi, is often the winner when health systems are doing head-to-head comparisons with other AI-powered medical scribes, Schwamm said.\n\nEarlier this year, Abridge gained a right to be integrated inside Epic. After Abridge records a session and a doctor stops the recording, “there is a note in English sitting inside of Epic waiting for them to quickly verify, edit and adjust it as they see fit,” Rao said.\n\nWhile Abridge appears to be ahead of its competitors — which, besides Microsoft-owned Nuance, include Ambience Healthcare, Nabla and Suki — Schwamm is not certain it will be able to maintain its lead over the long-term.\n\n“The big question is, do you need a dedicated medical LLM to be successful in this space?” he asked. “Or will the giant foundation models, GPT-4o, Google and Meta, get so good that they could ingest an entire corpus of medical notes and start to deliver performance that’s similar?”\n\nThat line of inquiry shows that these are still early days not just for virtual medical note taking but also for most generative AI companies.

The company introduced a solution called Ambient Notes in October that allows doctors to choose between various AI-powered documentation tools, and Abridge is the latest addition.\n\nAbridge uses AI to draft clinical notes in real time as doctors consensually record their visits with patients. The startup is part of a red-hot market that has exploded as health-care executives search for solutions to help reduce staff burnout and daunting administrative workloads.\n\n\"The market is going to evolve rather rapidly, there are going to be winners and losers over time,\" Athenahealth CEO Bob Segert told CNBC. \"Different physicians will prefer different ways that notes are taken and that the information is delivered, and we want to be able to provide that flexibility.\"\n\nAthenahealth and Abridge declined to share the financial details of the partnership.\n\nClinicians spend nearly nine hours a week on documentation, according to an October study from Google Cloud. And more than 90% of physicians report feeling burned out on a \"regular basis,\" according to a survey commissioned by Athenahealth last February.\n\nCompanies including Abridge, Microsoft's Nuance Communications, Suki and others say their AI scribing tools can help. Suki and iScribeHealth already offer their tools through Athenahealth's Ambient Notes solution.\n\n\"It'll be incumbent upon us to make sure that we're able to demonstrate differentiation,\" Abridge CEO Dr. Shiv Rao told CNBC. \"So far, we've had good luck these last few years doing that.\"\n\nAbridge has deployed its technology across more than 100 health systems in the U.S., including organizations like the Mayo Clinic, Duke Health and Johns Hopkins Medicine.\n\nThe company announced a $250 million funding round earlier this month. It also unveiled a new Contextual Reasoning Engine that can pull information that's relevant to a specific clinician and their clinic's best practices. Abridge's Rao said that technology will be available to Athenahealth clinicians.\n\nAthenahealth's Ambient Notes solution is currently available in a limited capacity, but the company said it plans to widen availability for clinicians through 2025.\n\n\"The more they try it, the more they like it, and I think we're going to see a pretty steep adoption curve as this continues to move forward,\" Segert said.",

It can convert patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real time.\n\nThe AI-generated summaries are mapped to ground truth with Linked Evidence technology to ensure accuracy.\n\nSutter's partnership with Abridge will also see the integration of patient-facing summaries in the EHR.\n\nFollowing successful implementations at Yale New Haven Health System, UCI Health, Emory Healthcare, the University of Kansas Health System, UPMC and numerous other health systems, Abridge also secured a $150 million Series C financing.\n\nThat included a strategic investment from NVIDIA to expedite a research and development agenda to scale up the clinical conversation platform across the broader U.S. healthcare system.\n\nAbridge uses NVIDIA's latest NIM inference microservices, integrated into the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform and built upon the company's TensorRT large language model to power its deep learning stack.\n\nTHE LARGER TREND\n\nSince 2018, healthcare workforce burnout rates have risen, though they began stabilizing in late 2022, according to a January report from KLAS.\n\nThe use of AI and generative AI could help reduce growing levels of burnout among healthcare professionals.\n\nSome experts have posited that an AI tool capable of generating an initial draft of a SOAP note, for example, which would then be subject to caregiver approval or editing, could significantly reduce clinicians' workload, saving them considerable time.\n\nIn an interview with HealthcareITNews in August 2023, Abridge founder and CEO Dr. Shiv Rao said AI-powered automation could have a huge impact on the demands of manual documentation and coding.\n\n\"If we could provide a magnitude greater speed and lower cost, turning patient conversation into highly professional notes with quality and accuracy, that we could refocus our profession on what matters most – being present and listening,\" he said.\n\nTrained on vast data sets, genAI holds significant promise in data-rich healthcare. An October 2023 report forecast that the technology within healthcare alone would surge to a $22 billion industry by 2032.\n\nThis growth would be aided by the formation of strategic partnerships among a growing cohort of companies integrating solutions into drug discovery, diagnostics, patient care and claims management.\n\nEarlier this month, NVIDIA launched 25 new genAI microservices aimed at diverse healthcare applications to facilitate integration of AI into both cloud-based and on-premises systems, targeting genomics, imaging, drug discovery and other digital health needs.\n\nOracle has also introduced a genAI tool and additional enhancements to its Data Intelligence Cloud Suite, bolstering Oracle Health Data Intelligence with performance enhancements, prebuilt clinical quality analytics and automated alerts to improve reimbursements and care quality.\n\nON THE RECORD\n\n\"We want to support our clinicians so they can sustainably serve our patients,\" said Dr. Albert Chan, Sutter Health's chief health information officer, in a statement about the new genAI work. \"Reducing administrative burden by two to three hours a day with Abridge can reduce the time our clinicians have historically spent away from their families and help our providers recharge and be the best versions of themselves when caring for patients.\""
