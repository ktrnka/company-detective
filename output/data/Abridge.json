To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law and in the interest of resolving disputes between You and Abridge in the most expedient and cost effective manner, You and Abridge agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration, unless You are located in a jurisdiction that prohibits the exclusive use of arbitration for dispute resolution.\n\nArbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this Agreement. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND Abridge ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. ‍\n\n(b) Opt-Out of Agreement to Arbitrate. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by contacting legal@abridge.com within 30 days of first accepting this Agreement and stating that you (include your first and last name, and email address used to register for the Abridge Clinician Dashboard) decline this arbitration agreement.‍\n\n(c) Exceptions. Despite the provisions of Section 15(a), nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either Party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.‍\n\n(d) Arbitrator. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any arbitration between You and Abridge will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Abridge.‍\n\n(e) Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice”). Abridge’s address for Notice is: Abridge AI, Inc., 500 Grant Street, Suite 2900, Pittsburgh, PA 15219. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The Parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the Parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, You or Abridge may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by You or Abridge must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in Your favor, Abridge will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Abridge in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.‍\n\n(f) Fees. If You commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Abridge will reimburse You for Your payment of the filing fee, unless Your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location, to be agreed upon, in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, You may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of Your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, You agree to reimburse Abridge for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.‍\n\n(g) No Class Actions. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND Abridge AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both You and Abridge agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, to the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law.‍\n\n(h) Claims. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, no action arising out of, in connection with, or relating to this Agreement shall be brought by You more than one (1) year after the accrual of the cause of action. This period shall not be extended for any reason, except by the written consent of both parties. All statutes or provisions of law which would toll or otherwise affect the running of the period of limitation are hereby waived, and no such statute or provision of law shall operate to extend the period limited in this paragraph, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.\n\n(a) Governing Law; Venue. To the fullest extent permitted pursuant to applicable law, these Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Pennsylvania without regard to conflict of law principles. If a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under this Agreement, then You and Abridge agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for the purpose of litigating any dispute.\n\n(b) International Users. We operate the Dashboard from locations within the United States. The Dashboard is intended for Users located within the United States. We make no representation that the Dashboard or Abridge Technology is appropriate or available for use outside of the United States. Access to the Dashboard from countries or territories or by individuals where such access is illegal is strictly prohibited.\n\n(c) Independent Contractors. The Parties are independent contractors. This Agreement does not establish any relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency between You, Abridge, and neither Party nor any third party will have the power to act on the other Party’s behalf without the other Party’s prior written consent.‍\n\n(d) Assignment. No Party shall have the right to assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, or any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the other Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), except that Abridge may assign this Agreement without consent as part of a corporate reorganization, reorganization, or upon a change of control, consolidation, merger, or transfer of all or substantially all of its business related to this Agreement, whether by sale of stock or assets, operation of law, or otherwise. Any attempted assignment or delegation in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.‍\n\n(e) Force Majeure. Except for the obligation to pay money, no Party will be liable for any failure or delay in its performance under this Agreement due to any cause beyond its reasonable control, including acts of war, acts of God, labor shortages or disputes, pandemics, governmental acts or failure or degradation of the Internet or telecommunications services. The delayed Party will give the other Party prompt notice of such cause, and will make commercially reasonable efforts to promptly correct such failure or delay in performance.\n\n(f) Severability; Waiver; Entire Agreement. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision shall be modified so as best to accomplish the original intent of the Parties to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in effect. The waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior understandings and agreements.‍\n\n(g) Promotion. Abridge may include Your name and logo in lists of Abridge’s customers, solely to identify You as a user of the Dashboard and further provided that such customer lists shall not be presented in such a way as to indicate or imply any endorsement by or affiliation with You unless Abridge obtains Your prior written consent.‍\n\n(h) Notices. Except as otherwise set forth herein, all notices under these Terms will be by email or provided by Us by way of the Dashboard. All notices to Us should be sent to legal@abridge.com. Notices will be deemed to have been duly given the same day in the case of notices provided by us by way of email or the Services.\n\n(i) No Third Party Beneficiary.

If You register for an account by way of a third party, such as a hospital with which you are affiliated, personal information You provided to that third party, such as Your name, phone number, email address and other information that third party allows us to access, will be used to create Your account with us, along with information that You provide to us directly. If You already have an account with Us which was created independently (including by way of our “self-serve” onboarding) and then are invited to join by a third party such as a hospital with which you are affiliated and who has a written agreement with Us, You will have access to the information stored independently previously by way of one Platform account, but the third party, once there is a master agreement in place, will control Your account with respect to activity under that master agreement and on behalf of that entity including that such third party will have the ability to suspend and/or terminate Your account connected to such third party’s master agreement, provided however, notwithstanding any master agreement, Your account and use of the Platform will remain subject to all of these Terms. If, at any time, you are no longer affiliated with the third party, You will have the ability to revert back to Your independent (or ‘self-serve’) account.\n\nYou are solely responsible for Your account information and any data that You provide to Us in connection with Your account (“Account Data”). You agree that You own or have the necessary rights, permissions and consents to all of Your Account Data and that use of the Account Data does not infringe, misappropriate or violate any third party’s intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations.

You agree to grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive license to access, use, export, process, copy, distribute, perform and display the Account Data in accordance these Terms including to provide, maintain and support the Abridge Services, to prevent or respond to security issues, to provide support or respond to technical issues, as required by law, as permitted by these Terms and as permitted by Your instructions. You are responsible for safeguarding Your account login credentials. You are also responsible for all of the activity within Your account, whether or not You authorized that activity. We will not be responsible for any damages, losses or liability if credentials or any account is not kept confidential by You, or information provided by an unauthorized third party logging into and accessing the Platform. You should immediately notify us of any unauthorized access to or use of Your account. We may review activity in connection with the Platform for compliance purposes, but we have no obligation to do so.

To give an example, I work in addiction treatment where you have to document group with 10 people. A reasonable chart would be quite short especially if the pt engaged in group positively. Insurance wants a novel and will find any excuse to deny a claim. So the new AI in EMRs will basically fluff out chart notes - it will use 3-4 words where 1 suffices, it will include long summaries of past notes, it will reiterate things from the pt’s history and demographics.\n\nAddiction treatment is probably like many other conditions where you have a problem: if you chart that the person is doing better, insurance will say they don’t need treatment anymore. If you chart that they aren’t doing better, they will say it’s not effective and they don’t need treatment anymore. So you also have to extensively document to somehow prove they still need treatment even though the treatment is working.\n\n#### Comment ID m618qzs with +1 score by [(A313-Isoke, Reddit, 2025-01-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthcare/comments/1huzkou/ai_may_listen_in_on_your_next_doctors_appointment/m618qzs/) (in reply to ID m5wo08c):\nThank you, that's a great example.

      "# Post ID 1i3zkte: Best AI Medical Scribe out there? with +3 score by [(doctorgreybc, Reddit, 2025-01-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/emergencymedicine/comments/1i3zkte/best_ai_medical_scribe_out_there/)\n\nHi there, everyone!\n\nI know that lately, there have been many clinical or medical AI scribes showing up, and I know there are many solutions that are coming out into the market. I'm looking for recommendations on the best scribe out there. It's 2025, and I'm looking for something that has evolved over the past years. As you know, new solutions and new AI models are out there in the market, and it seems like performance and also the quality of reasoning have improved significantly. So I think that now is a good time to ask these questions.\n\nI have researched the following:\n\n* Freed AI,\n* Deep Scribe\n* Abridge\n* Wavo Health\n* Tali\n* Suki\n* Heidi Health\n* Mutuo Health\n\nI have actually created free accounts for some of these, and for others, I've booked a demo.\n\nWhat I can say is that most of these are actually quite similar. If anything, I can say that perhaps one of the most important aspects for me was quality, price, and functionality.\n\nFor my short testing, I can say that Freed AI, Wavo Health, and Heidi Health are actually quite performant and quite similar in terms of functionality quality with some extra benefits. I'll cover that later.\n\nAbridge,  Deepscribe and Suki seem to be more like enterprise AI scribes as opposed to more like for private practice. And they seem to be trying to integrate with certain EMRs.\n\nTali and Mutuo Health, as well as Wavo Health, seem to be Canadian companies. Tali uses a Chrome extension, and Mutuo Health is completely not worth trying. The overall UI and functionality are a mess, but it's pretty limited, not intuitive, and seems really basic compared to the other solutions. Wavo Health is one of those that actually strikes a balance between its functionality and it seems to work across devices.\n\nNow, some context -  I'm planning to use it mainly for private practice, and therefore my options are right now between Freed AI, Wavo Health, and Heidi Health. The reason why I completely discarded Tali is because of the way that it works, which is a Chrome extension and I prefer a dedicated solution where I know that everything's stored and is easy to access, as well as a dedicated solution can provide an easy way to edit, which is kind of difficult with Tali.\n\nHas anyone been using any of these solutions for longer? I think so far I'm leaning towards Freed AI or Wavo Health. And I'm trying to decide. The only reason why Heidi Health might not make it in my todo is because the data seems to be processed outside of North America.\n\nHappy to hear your guys' thoughts. And I'll report back as I keep using some of these free versions as of now.\n\n## Comment ID m7rccxv with +3 score by [(EWOKofDESTINY, Reddit, 2025-01-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/emergencymedicine/comments/1i3zkte/best_ai_medical_scribe_out_there/m7rccxv/) (in reply to ID 1i3zkte):\n1000% Cleo.

I gave it a try during a shift, and my two comments are:\n\n1. It's nice that it has an app, but all of the different AI scribes have a mobile app nowadays, so I don't think that's a differentiator.\n2. Most of my consultations happen using the desktop computer or the laptop, so I definitely need or prefer something that's on the web. I do see the benefits of having a mobile app, and Wavo also has a mobile app, as well as Heidi or Freed AI. The thing that Clio lacks a lot is their web app; it's completely non-working. You can barely do anything with that. I mean you can only see the information, but good luck editing it and adding more stuff - you cannot even trigger the AI scribe on the web. So I think it's falling behind. The accuracy of the Cleo note is pretty good, it's actually really similar to all the other solutions out there. That's a i guess the only good common the other things is that it just falls short um so far i've been testing Wavo Health, and I think that's the one that I'm sticking for now.\n\nMy top list of best AI medical scribes or clinical scribes or whatever the name that is being used now. I can also see  the term Ambient Scribe is now:\n\n1. Wavo Health\n2. Freed AI\n3.

Being honest, I think I'm sticking with Wavo Health - one of the best solutions that I have tested. You can try it for free. It has all the other functionality as the other ones: you can create your custom templates, you can even has an AI Insights where you can ask anything about related to the encounter and even related to the patient if needed. You can assign the notes in patient folders or assign it to a patient, and you can get a quick glance on an overview of all the insight for from all the different encounters that I had with the patient.

Custom templates and smart editing are such a game-changer—like, they save so much time by making the notes fit exactly what you need. I’ve tried a few AI scribes, and honestly, **Twofold seems a lot like Freed AI to me** (which, I’m not even sure if that’s a good thing or kinda concerning? **It feels like a straight-up copycat.** Same colors, same design, same layout with the patients on the side, even the way the notes are structured—subjective, objective, all that. Same way you can copy the whole note or just individual sections. It’s like… almost identical? I don’t know what to say, haha). The only real difference I see is the custom templates, which Freed doesn’t do yet.\n\nBut yeah, I’m still sticking with WAVO Health for now. It’s just… different, you know? It’s not just about transcribing or templates. Like, you can literally ask WAVO anything about the encounter, and it’ll give you an answer with references back to the transcript. It’s like having a second brain that actually *gets* what happened during the visit. Plus, it can handle stuff like scanned PDFs or Word docs, and it works on pretty much any device. For me, those extra features make WAVO stand out.\n\nTotally agree though—custom templates and smart editing are a must for any AI scribe. It’s cool to see more tools adding that.

I see you can also select different transcription models from Wispr or Pro Record, which I guess is their own model. The thing that I didn't like is that it didn't produce a good clinical note, and it crashed on my side. I think because it's using a bunch of resources from my computer because I can see that it is transcribing in real-time, which actually Wavo Health does as well, but this one seems to be laggy after a certain time. Otherwise, nice animations, but it still just looks nice and cool, but uh, it doesn't provide the functionality.

My primary goal is to offload administrative tasks and streamline workflows to give providers more time to focus on patient care and ultimately improve health outcomes.\n\nWith the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI scribing has gained significant traction. Numerous products are now available to assist with clinical documentation. For those who have integrated these tools into their practice, I’d love to hear your experiences:\n\n1. **Reliability**: Have the AI scribing tools proven reliable enough for you to trust them in your daily practice?\n2. **Missing Features**: What key features do you feel are lacking in the current offerings?\n3. **Integration**: Many providers emphasize the importance of EHR integration. How effectively have these integrations saved you time and streamlined your workflow?\n4. **Impact on Patient Care**: Have you observed any changes, whether positive or negative, in patient care or your interactions with patients since adopting AI scribing tools?\n5. **Training and Support**: How would you rate the training and support provided for these tools? Are there any additional resources or improvements that you believe would be helpful?\n\nI am here not to promote a specific product, but rather to learn about what works well and what falls short.

Human transcriber reviews notes, it takes quite a while for the notes to come back.  Human editors are quite apparent in the note quality.  \n\nFreed - a real AI service.  Quick and efficient.  Almost no features, but it doesn't need much.  Often includes what I saw as if the patient says it, not great.\n\nHeidi - almost perfect.  Like actually almost perfect, out of the box.  The phrasing in notes is terse and \"medical\" without excessive verbosity.  The generation is A+ with great settings on variability.  Hallucination rate is low, context understanding is unsettlingly high.  Only caveat is the website is a little heavy, can be a touch slow on a tablet or phone.\n\nWhat's missing...not much.  Heidi gets it good.  Integration in EMR maybe, but copy and paste works great.  I would have a hard time doing better than Heidi and I say this as a software engineer with very high standards.\n\nNote that all notes require careful review.  These models do occasionally misinterpret and hallucinate.  Of note, if Heidi gets it wrong, you can easily regenerate the note and it will often do a better job, which is nice.\n\nThe hallucination in Heidi is really interesting.  Sometimes it will hallucinate something into the A&P that we didn't talk about which is clinically relevant and we SHOULD have talked about.  A couple times I've called the patient in the evening to talk about it, even.  Go figure. Wouldn't have expected it to be a clinical decision informer but sometimes it is.  Frankly I kinda enjoy going through the notes, it's an interesting second opinion and review of the visit.\n\nI don't mean to rain on your parade but this is the truth.\n\nThe next untouched AI tool is something to query the medical record, \"has patient X ever been tested for hepatitis\" or \"has anyone tried to find out why their alkaline phosphatase is high.\" Or using AI to navigate MIPS and insurance prior auths.\n\n### Comment ID l8cmrab with +15 score by [(DrMo-UC, Reddit, 2024-06-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8cmrab/) (in reply to ID l8cg6pn):\n>The next untouched AI tool is something to query the medical record, \"has patient X ever been tested for hepatitis\" or \"has anyone tried to find out why their alkaline phosphatase is high.\"\n\nIt's the only AI tool I need for which actually doesn't even have to be AI.\n\n#### Comment ID l8ff9vl with +3 score by [(MarcoGalletti, Reddit, 2024-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8ff9vl/) (in reply to ID l8cmrab):\nHi OP, I would not say that it is untouched.

The integration is a huge time saver. Not having to copy/paste saves a lot of time. Overall, the AI quality is good, and I like the AVS that it generates as a patient-level recap of the visit. The only issue has been needing to recap the visit at the end for a more accurate A&P. I like to do it in the room, but often, the patient constantly interrupts with comments that may or may not be related. It has captured some diagnoses or topics for the plan. I remember we talked about them in the room but forgot to write them down, so that has been good. There are rare hallucinations in the notes. More it is that the AI includes small topics that the patient mentioned, but I don't feel they are worth having in the notes.\n\n  \nThe biggest AI need, however, is software to OCR the digital PDF archives, combine them with the CareEverywhere documentation and clinic documentation, and create a nice patient overview.\n\n### Comment ID l8eybd2 with +2 score by [(markatdaily, Reddit, 2024-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8eybd2/) (in reply to ID l8diu3i):\n> The only issue has been needing to recap the visit at the end for a more accurate A&P.

They perform the same way every single time. Crash some but not horrible. The problem is, consistently mediocre is still mediocre. They do reliable listen and transcribe - I cannot say much bad about this. They are accurate in simply getting conversation into the program. \n\nOne major problem for me is syntax. The end result is written in a way that I don’t find attractive or natural. Feels more bulky. Too wordy. “The patient” over and over. Tries to use big words that are never used in an HPI. Just seems forced. Although information is correct, it comes across in a way I don’t like and I’m too anal to leave it. Sometimes wont filter out information. Throws an entire paragraph about the patients ski trip last year that is irrelevant to current complaint of gout. \n\nIntegration is key. Proof and edit is going to be needed. But if it takes multiple steps or another program to access the AI generated information, then it’s not saving you as much time as it promises. Just more clicks to copy paste and so forth. In my opinion any program that doesn’t integrate directly into your note is useless in my opinion. \n\nKeying up orders would be helpful but take some work. Would never be perfect. I would like more ability to edit the product to be something closer to how I prefer to write. \n\nImpact on patient care? So far for me…more eye contact. That’s about it. \n\nTraining should be focused on teaching users what words and phrases to use to help the program out. To help get the right information into the exam vs the assessment and plan. To get the right diagnoses etc. The goal should be less editing. The result should be 90% done. But it’s nowhere close for me personally. \n\nThese have potential, but we are a long ways away from where they’ll have to be to be used widely across specialties, doc, systems, etc. \n\nFor the record, my experience is with DAX.\n\n### Comment ID l8cf8jc with +7 score by [(grey-doc, Reddit, 2024-06-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8cf8jc/) (in reply to ID l8cbx7u):\nTry Heidi with the \"brief\" or \"Goldilocks\" verbosity setting.

I have written a script to anonymize the transcripts, which I then send to chatgpt for note creation. \n\nThe prompt I'm using to create the note is a bit of a work in progress. Overall, it is successful in creating what I need about 95% of the time. It certainly shortens the time I spend writing notes. \n\nHowever, a 5% error rate is still 1 in 20, and I have to review the notes very carefully before finalizing them. \n\nSo far what has not yet been successful is creating an organized task list for the patient in myself for future follow-up. \n\nAnother interesting aspect of my practice, being cash only, is that I have no particular billing or coding requirements, and the structure of my notes has changed dramatically from the soap note that I was taught in residency. My visits are also an hour or more in length, and cover topics ranging from emotional processing to relationships to lab results to longevity studies. \n\nI'm very curious about how a commercial product like Heidi would perform with my very \"non medical\" conversational topics with patients.\n\nSo far the prompt I have crafted and tweaked is doing well at creating a note that I find useful and serviceable. \n\nThe biggest issue is when it misses something that I know I talked about with the patient, and I have to search the transcript to find it.\n\n### Comment ID l8ere5m with +2 score by [(Harvard_Med_USMLE265, Reddit, 2024-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8ere5m/) (in reply to ID l8dpgum):\nWould you be willing to share your prompt?

I can see three patients in a row and it keeps track of everything I covered in each visit with more precision than my memory. The notes are detailed and comprehensive. It's not perfect.

The AI part of it then takes that transcription and writes a SOAP note summarizing the conversation. It's really good at filtering out the small talk vs the clinically important things for the HPI part, and knows to list the diagnosis with the relevant associated counseling and prescriptions in the assessment and plans part. It has a concise vs comprehensive mode for how succinct you want your notes to be. I use concise and it's still plenty detailed though. You can view the raw  transcription of the conversation if you feel its interpretation of some point wasn't quite right and you want to double check what was actually said. My editing is usually to shorten the note even further because it incorporated pieces of history that weren't relevant to the current complaint.

      "# Post ID 1b0befu: Best AI medical scribe tools? Do people use them? with +86 score by [(guiltless_inaccuracy, Reddit, 2024-02-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/)\nPhysician in a small clinic here. My practice has been looking into these new AI medical scribes to help with our clinical documentation. Everyone’s pretty burned out from spending so much time on patient notes, so this seems like a really interesting solution. Are these tools safe & legit?\n\nI wanted to try DeepScribe and DAX but it seems like you have to go through sales. A friend recommended NoteMD and I’ve been trying it out for a few days. So far it’s pretty good (it doesn’t save patient recordings which is great), but sometimes it doesn’t capture a sentence or two.\n\nWhat do people think about using these? Are they safe?\n\nEDIT: Thanks all for your comments, please stop spamming me in DMs :-) Our practice ended up with NoteMD which is working great.\n\n## Comment ID ks7b78p with +34 score by [(DrTestificate_MD, Reddit, 2024-02-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7b78p/) (in reply to ID 1b0befu):\nYes some people are using them. Permanente ran a pilot study making it available to 10000 docs and a significant percentage of them used it for over 100 encounters over a 4 week period. One doctor used it for over 1000 encounters in that time.\n\nThere are a ton available online now, some you can even use for free.

Captures most of what is said and knows where to put it (History, exam, A/P, PI etc). Produces paragraphs of prose. For some reason it sucks at documenting my reasoning in an A/P — wordy, misses the if-then logic. Helps a little with allowing more eye contact with patient during visit but I gave up on it. Takes me 2 min to write my own primary care notes (after a little pre-charting.) When an AI model can read my previous notes and learn how I document and reproduce my style then I’ll use it. Until then, practice a poetics of concision and save the $$.\n\n### Comment ID kuakl8t with +2 score by [(LordVile37, Reddit, 2024-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/kuakl8t/) (in reply to ID ks91vix):\nHey there!

It's really good at adding details I might not include, such as subjective information. It takes some getting used to, as far as having to say everything if you want it in the note.

I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers. Full HIPAA compliance and patient information is protected.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more!

They have a live scribe on with you all day to do your orders, coding, mapping diagnosis, etch and then the AI listens to your conversation that you have with the patient to capture the visit and then produces the note.  The live scribe imports the note to the chart.  It works great and the providers love it.  The scribes are off shore so the cost is low.  The AI note outputs are quite impressive and having a real person help the doctors made adoption very easy.

I use it solely for the HPI for the following reasons:\n\n1: I find it mentally exhausting to create a narrative that does not satisfy any metric for reimbursement, is often wrong 1-3 hours later when I cannot remember a detail, and as more patients review their notes that's the thing they focus on ('doc I told you I was in Reno when I sprained my ankle not Vegas').\n\n2. I like formulating the A/P, and it's critical for my follow-up, and DAX imo does not do a good job on this, certainly not better than I can do and it matters most for other docs to follow my logic.\n\nSince starting it I am able to close notes faster for the sheer fact that I do not feel gutted by the chore of dictating an HPI that is often of no clinical value to me since I already know exactly what needs to happen. I do read the HPI from DAX and add details sometimes or correct pronouns. Before DAX instead of dictating an HPI I would probably browse Reddit out of boredom and avoidance.\n\nI like it, and it took little time to make it pretty seamless.\n\nedit - many of the docs I work with use it for the whole note and are very happy with it.\n\n### Comment ID lur86lf with +5 score by [(bevespi, Reddit, 2024-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1ggmdf8/thoughtsexperiences_working_with_ai_scribes/lur86lf/) (in reply to ID luqsgbn):\nI use DAX as well. For the A/P, the gathering of information and putting it in the A/P naturally can be janky. That said, if I’m being super specific about my A/P, I will let the A/P recording for when I leave the room. When you say: plan for this patient is: 1. 2. 3. and dictate the A/P it will usually overwrite anything it would have generated naturally.\n\nFor example- Type 2 DM without complications and long term use of insulin (yay HCC): A1C at goal. No hypoglycemia. Microalbumin screen is negative. Continue current medications. Repeat DM labs prior to OV in 6 months.\n\n## Comment ID lurvcic with +16 score by [(DrCapeBreton, Reddit, 2024-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1ggmdf8/thoughtsexperiences_working_with_ai_scribes/lurvcic/) (in reply to ID 1ggmdf8):\nHeidi - literally saving me about 2 hrs of charting each evening and I feel so much more free to dive into complex patients with that extra time and not having to stress about remembering every detail because it’ll be there for me.

You can pay for a faster version but I wait the 10-15s for the note to generate by reviewing labs or inputting procedures/billing so I don’t see any need to upgrade.

I’ve always been a fast typer and good at taking notes and never really had any issues with charting. I find that I run it in the background for most interactions, but I only copy/paste from it for maybe 10 to 20% of them because most of the time, my own notes while I’m listening to the patients are a lot more succinct. I find it good for those ADHD type of patients who come in with long lists of complaints and keep jumping for one thing to another. Then I do a light edit to what I pasted from the Scribe. But for the overwhelming majority of interactions, I still find my own notetaking is better. And I’ve been told by staff that I have some of the most thorough and most organized notes of anyone else at the clinic so it’s not like my regular notes are too short or sloppy. \n\nMy colleague who owns the clinic is a massive Heidi devotee. He was thinking of retiring in a year, but now he says with Heidi, he plans to work another five years.

It gives you a gender neutral HPI (i.e. uses \"they/them\" pronouns) as well as mental status exam (I'm in psychiatry) and plan.  The MSE and plan are useless, at least for me. The HPI is decent.\n\nFreed doesn't show you a transcription live but you can access it afterwards. It gives a better HPI than Nabla and you can choose gender so it sounds better than using \"they/them\" all over. It also does a more honest job at the MSE; basically never attempts to write one and says \"not enough objective data.\" It also gives a plan and after visit summary. Both are really solid. Anything you say during the appointment in terms of plan, it'll capture. If I mention diet and exercise, it'll put in specifically what I said rather than just say \"lifestyle changes\". I have a template for plan that I prefer using so I don't actually use that part but I could easily see someone finding it useful (unlike Nabla where I don't think most people would find the generated plan sufficient). The after visit summary is gold though. Writes instructions as a letter from you to the patient, with an easy to read list of what was talked about during the appointment. \n\nIf they cut the price in half, I'd recommend Freed without any doubt. I wouldn't say it's worth a $100 a month though, especially since Nabla is free and the HPI is the main thing you want from an AI anyway, not plan or AVS.\n\n#### Comment ID k20c8mu with +13 score by [(blade24, Reddit, 2023-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k20c8mu/) (in reply to ID k1y3r77):\nWhat are the legal ramifications of these?

Full HIPAA compliance and patient information is protected.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more!

We've put in a lot of time and careful effort into building our compliant Scribe tool, and I can confidently say that it is the most feature-dense AI scribe currently offered directly to clinicians. As of today, we're free to use (indefinitely), with the option to upgrade to Pro should you find yourself using those features extensively.  \n\n\n  \n***I'm all ears to get feedback and listen to users!***  \n\n\nHeidi has you covered when it comes to **notes, documentation, templates (both preset and custom), Ask AI (your ai toolbar), HIPAA compliance, ISO27001 certification**.  \n\n\n***Most importantly***, what we want to create is your clinical twin, so **Heidi learns your style and preferences as you continue to use it, and create your personalised templates.**  \n\n\nI see a lot of debates here surrounding pricing, quality, usability and compliance which is great to see, plenty of decent options out there and always good to analyse tools before use in a clinical setting. I hope that Heidi can offer a solution that people find safe, secure and able to outperform all the other current solutions (**and if it's not then let us know, we're listening**).\n\n### Comment ID kp4y7o3 with +2 score by [(Curious_Shape2525, Reddit, 2024-02-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/kp4y7o3/) (in reply to ID kocoip9):\nI've been using Heidi for 2 weeks and love it!

I’ve been using Suki. It has direct access to my EMR and schedule so it’s as simple as clicking the patients name and starting the “note”. I access it through my phone and leave the phone near the patient and myself. It then processes the ramblings (I can be all over the place sometimes) of the visit and manages to organize it into HPI and a/p VERY accurately and in better detail than what I would normally do without it. It also does physical exam and other things like patient instructions but you’d need to speak out the physical exam which is weird. It has been life changing because it takes away the mental burden of documenting after seeing patients. I often do all my notes at lunch and then after the afternoon session because it allows me to stay on time and focus on the patient. Knowing all the details are being captured and all I need to do is organize the note a little is FANTASTIC. It requires so much less brain power than formulating the note and truly does it so well.\n\nCurrently offered by my practice but it’s 400 a month which is pricey. I’d consider paying that just for the life outside of work it has given back.\n\n### Comment ID ktuc8j4 with +1 score by [(Basic-personofmed, Reddit, 2024-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/ktuc8j4/) (in reply to ID kp61o18):\ndo you know which practices use Suki or which organizations...med student here trying to understand the ambient documentation space more\n\n#### Comment ID ktv1is6 with +1 score by [(nickplat, Reddit, 2024-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/ktv1is6/) (in reply to ID ktuc8j4):\nI don’t honestly.

You make and edit charts using your phone app, the AI can be used as dictation or can ambiently listen to the conversation and have the portions of the chart completed when you get back to your desk.

That and/or there will be a central “Patient history” where it gives you an integrated view of their whole health based on notes and meta data.\n\n## Comment ID laol63h with +45 score by [(Brosa91, Reddit, 2024-06-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/1dqjimn/when_will_ai_write_our_notes/laol63h/) (in reply to ID 1dqjimn):\nMy guess is 1-2 years in private practice, 3-4 for private hospitals and 5+ for academia lol\n\n### Comment ID laotxzk with +57 score by [(aspiringkatie, Reddit, 2024-06-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/1dqjimn/when_will_ai_write_our_notes/laotxzk/) (in reply to ID laol63h):\nAnd sometime later this century at the VA\n\n#### Comment ID lap53cf with +19 score by [(hasniii321, Reddit, 2024-06-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/1dqjimn/when_will_ai_write_our_notes/lap53cf/) (in reply to ID laotxzk):\nAre you sure this century?\n\n#### Comment ID lapq2fg with +9 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-06-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/1dqjimn/when_will_ai_write_our_notes/lapq2fg/) (in reply to ID laotxzk):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID lasa2fb with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-06-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/1dqjimn/when_will_ai_write_our_notes/lasa2fb/) (in reply to ID laotxzk):\nNo no.

It's a place where my healthcare experience is valued while I get to explore the exciting world of AI.\n\nInclusive and Diverse Culture: The company truly embraces diversity. During my interview process, I felt comfortable sharing my identity as a queer person and felt genuinely accepted. Abridge encourages everyone to show up as their authentic selves.\n\nExceptional Colleagues: I'm surrounded by brilliant minds – clinicians, scientists, and engineers. It's easy for someone in my role to feel inferior to these brilliant individuals but they've never made me feel that way. Every voice and experience is valued here.\n\nInspiring Leadership: The leadership team embodies Abridge's values, particularly in honoring humanity. They make every team member feel seen and heard, regardless of their position.\n\nCompetitive Compensation: In my career across multiple companies, Abridge offers the highest compensation I've received. For a Customer Support Specialist role, the salary is remarkably generous.\n\nComprehensive Benefits: The healthcare benefits are impressive. I have affordable copays, zero deductible for in-network PCPs, and the convenience of having medical, dental, and vision under one insurance provider.\n\nInvestment in Personal Growth: Abridge's new learning and professional development program provides an annual budget for skill enhancement, professional coaching, and certifications. This commitment to employee growth is exciting for a lifelong learner like me.\n\nMeaningful Work: Being part of a company that's shaping the future of healthcare AI gives a sense of purpose to my daily work.",

While some teams are inclusive and less toxic than others, burnout is a central theme at every level. \n\nPeople don’t trust each other and are afraid to speak up, so slack is filled with shout outs praise, and a ton of self promotion, but if you speak one on one with someone, beneath the surface, people are afraid and miserable.\n\nThe company’s internal motto is to work as fast and as much as possible to win, even at the expense of smart decisions, creativity, individuality, diversity, and most of all - health and wellbeing.

However, I choose to remain anonymous to protect my identity. One major challenge we faced was the severe lack of revenue, which put an immense amount of stress on the business as a whole. This financial strain impacted various aspects of the company's operations, contributing to an overall atmosphere of uncertainty. Moreover, a noticeable power struggle was eminent among the top-level executives, which negatively affected decision-making processes and hindered progress. It was disheartening to witness how this internal struggle trickled down and impacted the overall work environment. Regrettably, the company recently resorted to implementing secretive layoffs. Disconcertingly, both employees who had been with the organization for a few months and those with many years of service were affected. This sudden downsizing not only caused disruption but also undermined employee morale, creating a sense of uncertainty and job insecurity among the workforce. Additionally, I observed a steady decline in the people culture within the organization. The once supportive and collaborative atmosphere had deteriorated, leading to a less comfortable and engaging work environment.",

This financial strain impacted various aspects of the company's operations, contributing to an overall atmosphere of uncertainty. Moreover, a noticeable power struggle was eminent among the top-level executives, which negatively affected decision-making processes and hindered progress. It was disheartening to witness how this internal struggle trickled down and impacted the overall work environment. Regrettably, the company recently resorted to implementing secretive layoffs. Disconcertingly, both employees who had been with the organization for a few months and those with many years of service were affected. This sudden downsizing not only caused disruption but also undermined employee morale, creating a sense of uncertainty and job insecurity among the workforce. Additionally, I observed a steady decline in the people culture within the organization. The once supportive and collaborative atmosphere had deteriorated, leading to a less comfortable and engaging work environment.",

      "# [Abridge Emerges as a Healthcare AI Leader, Raising $150M](https://www.abridge.com/press-release/series-c-150)\nPITTSBURGH, PA (February 23, 2024) – Abridge, the leader in generative AI for clinical documentation, announced an additional $150 million investment, leveraging momentum from their product’s rapid uptake among health systems throughout the nation. This raise comes just 4 months after their $30M Series B, and is one of the largest funding rounds made to date in generative AI for healthcare.\n\nThe Series C investment was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, who will also join the board. Other new and existing investors continuing to support the company include co-lead Redpoint Ventures, with support from IVP, Spark Capital, Union Square Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Wittington Ventures, Mass General Brigham Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation Fund (AIDIF), Kaiser Permanente Ventures, and CVS Health Ventures.\n\nToday, Abridge also announced a new enterprise agreement with the Yale New Haven Health System, the largest and most comprehensive healthcare system in Connecticut, that will give thousands of clinicians access to Abridge for clinical documentation. Yale New Haven Health has selected Abridge as their generative AI partner in this area of ambient listening. The initial deployment will be focused on reducing the cognitive burden of clinical documentation, enabling clinicians to spend more face-to-face time engaging with patients instead of computers.\n\n“Freeing doctors from the burden of documentation will dramatically improve both quality of care and the doctor-patient relationship,” said Paul Ricci, Advisor, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and former Chairman and CEO of Nuance Communications. “Abridge will allow caregivers to capture an enormous amount of data that is currently being discarded or ignored, and that in turn will likely lead to new insights in managing population health. I’m thrilled to work with Dr. Rao and his team on the next great step in the evolution of healthcare.”\n\n“Abridge has set new standards for quality and responsible deployment of generative AI in health systems across the U.S., cementing it as the industry’s most trusted AI platform,” said Sebastian Duesterhoeft, Partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. “Abridge stands out for their innovation in all facets of product development. CTO Zack Lipton, a widely cited Associate Professor at Carnegie Mellon and pioneer in responsible AI research, has assembled the strongest research team in healthcare AI. They have set new expectations for transparency and verification with their evidence extraction technology, and raised the bar for both note quality and evaluation methodology.”\n\nAbridge has been assembling a world-class AI team for years and these investments are rapidly hitting production. In the last year alone, they delivered an industry-leading automatic speech recognition engine purpose-built for healthcare applications. Their speech and language technologies have been rigorously evaluated in 14 languages and functionally support many more—performing well even amidst rapid switches between languages and when interpreters are in the room. Abridge is ahead of the market in controlling its full technology pipeline, developing its own purpose-built LLMs. Moreover, its “Linked Evidence” feature, a first-of-its kind technology that maps any highlighted region within a summary to the substantiating evidence in the source transcript (and thus to the underlying audio) has become a required capability. The company is actively developing novel ways to personalize notes, integrate more deeply into the EMR, and provide clinicians with after-visit insights.\n\nWith this new capital, Abridge will continue to push boldly into fundamental research, developing bedrock foundation models that draw upon vast troves of multimodal healthcare data. These models will both power improvements to Abridge’s existing product lines and enable a new wave of possibilities in the future.\n\n“We are grateful to be partnering with iconic institutions that share our dedication to improving the lives of patients and clinicians,” said Dr. Shiv Rao, CEO and Founder of Abridge. “This company was founded on the premise that clinician-patient conversations are at the core of all healthcare. Already, this information is powering a revolution in AI-based documentation. In the future, it will open new pathways to improve patient outcomes. Realizing this vision requires world-class talent and formidable compute resources. We are now uniquely positioned to build the AI platform that brings this vision to life.”\n\nAbout Abridge\n\nAbridge was founded in 2018 with the mission of powering deeper understanding in healthcare. The AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most—their patients.\n\nAbridge’s enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time with deep EMR integrations. Powered by Linked Evidence and their auditable AI, Abridge is the only company that maps AI-generated summaries to ground truth, helping providers quickly trust and verify the output. As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, Abridge is setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.\n\nContact",
      "# [MemorialCare Partners with Abridge, Poised to Transform Healthcare Delivery](https://www.abridge.com/press-release/abridge-memorialcare)\nFOUNTAIN VALLEY, Calif. and PITTSBURGH, Penn., April 16, 2024 – Today, MemorialCare and Abridge announced a partnership to make Abridge's generative AI tool for clinical documentation available to MemorialCare's physicians across southern California. MemorialCare expects that Abridge will restore the human-to-human connection between clinicians and patients, and strip away the administrative burden for clinicians.\n\n“Watching Abridge work in real-time sometimes feels like watching a science-fiction movie—it’s magical. It is a privilege for me to be part of the effort to bring Abridge into MemorialCare and the broader healthcare community,” said Dr. David Kim, EVP and CEO, MemorialCare Medical Foundation. “I have a bold prediction for how Abridge will impact us—⅓ of clinicians will go home sooner, ⅓ will use Abridge to sustain the strains of today’s healthcare pressures, and ⅓ will be able to see more critical patients who need timely attention.”\n\nClinicians at MemorialCare have used Abridge for the last few months, and a very tangible impact is already being felt. Abridge supports over 50 specialties and 14 languages, making it easy for the platform to support MemorialCare’s diverse patient population. Abridge’s Linked Evidence foundation provides a layer of trust for clinicians to verify any part of the summary against the source transcript and audio. Further, Abridge’s platform is deeply connected into MemorialCare’s Epic workflow, reducing any major change management hurdles.\n\n“I have never seen such an immediate impact from a technology solution. Abridge is saving our providers up to 10 minutes per visit. For the first time in years, one of our clinicians finally had time to both eat and read a journal during lunch,” said Dr. Tanya Dansky, Senior Medical Director, MemorialCare Medical Group. “But what makes Abridge truly special is its ability to allow patients to interact with clinicians in ways they are most comfortable. One clinician conducted a visit in both Vietnamese and English wearing an N95 mask, and a complete note was produced in real-time in English.”\n\n“With Abridge, a physical barrier has been broken between the clinician and patient without the need for a computer, and mental bandwidth has been created for a clinician to be fully present,” said Barry Arbuckle, PhD, President and CEO, MemorialCare. “This partnership will make significant improvements in how our clinicians practice medicine, bringing them back to the roots of why they chose medicine in the first place.”\n\n“We are privileged to partner with MemorialCare and innovate together around value-based workflows,” said Dr. Shiv Rao, CEO and Founder, Abridge. “AI can remove friction and clerical overhead, helping clinicians reclaim the mental space to think through care plans for their patients.”\n\nThis news follows successful deployments of the Abridge technology at Sutter Health, Yale New Haven Health System, UCI Health, Emory Healthcare, The University of Kansas Health System, UPMC, and dozens of other health systems. Abridge recently announced a$150M Series C financing, which includes a strategic investment from NVIDIA that will allow them to accelerate their bold research and development plan. This work will power improvements to Abridge’s existing product lines and enable a new wave of possibilities in the future.\n\nAbout Abridge\n\nAbridge was founded in 2018 with the mission of powering deeper understanding in healthcare.

      "# [Clinical notes automation startup Abridge raises $150 million, takes aim at Microsoft Nuance by Mohana Ravindranath on 2024-02-23](https://www.statnews.com/2024/02/23/clinical-notes-automation-startup-abridge-raises-150-million-takes-aim-at-microsoft-nuance/)\nA Pittsburgh artificial intelligence startup emerging as a challenger to Microsoft’s clinical note taking business has raised $150 million, a rare mega deal in a funding lull. The startup, Abridge, also has an unlikely cheerleader: Paul Ricci, the former head of Nuance, the service from Microsoft it competes with.\n\nAbridge sells an AI tool that rapidly transcribes and summarizes doctors’ conversations with patients in a hospital’s electronic health records software. The startup’s leaders and investors tell STAT they’re betting that their medical knowledge, agility, and willingness to co-develop features with customers makes it a more attractive long term option than Nuance, which Microsoft says is currently used by most U.S. hospitals.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMicrosoft, Abridge and other startups like Suki, Corti and Nabla are locked in a race to ease provider burnout by automating clinical note taking, and — thanks to generative AI — organizing the data in a way that could improve care, such as suggesting topics for follow-up, simplifying billing or analyzing trends at the broader patient population level.",
      "# [Mayo Clinic Expands Use of Abridge Enterprise](https://www.abridge.com/press-release/mayo-clinic-announcement)\nSAN FRANCISCO, CA, and ROCHESTER, MN—January 14, 2025—Abridge has finalized an enterprise-wide agreement with Mayo Clinic to implement the AI-powered clinical documentation platform, starting with approximately 2,000 clinicians who serve over 1 million patients annually across a wide range of specialties and care settings.\n\nThis marks a significant expansion in the collaboration between Mayo Clinic and Abridge, building on the previously announced initiative to enhance nursing documentation workflows, which are being developed as part of the Epic Workshop program*.\n\n“At Mayo Clinic, we are committed to leveraging innovative AI platforms to improve both clinicians' well-being and provide high-quality, patient-centered care,” said Dr. Amy Williams, Executive Dean, Practice, Mayo Clinic. “This collaboration aims to enhance our continuous innovation and empowers our clinicians to focus on what matters most–our patients.”\n\nDuring the evaluation process, Mayo Clinic performed a rigorous clinical note quality assessment to ensure that notes generated by Abridge would meet the high standards that Mayo Clinic maintains.\n\n“This expansion reflects a shared mission to ease administrative burden, ultimately enabling both physicians and nurses to dedicate more attention to focused patient care,” said Dr. Shiv Rao, CEO and Founder of Abridge. “Mayo Clinic’s ethos for adopting high-quality innovation complements our drive to continuously enhance our platform to meet the unique needs of clinicians across diverse specialties, languages, and care settings.”\n\nAbridge is rapidly becoming the platform of choice for enterprise-wide deployment at leading healthcare systems across the country, including Johns Hopkins Medicine, Corewell Health, Deaconess Health System, Reid Health, University of Vermont Health Network, CHRISTUS Health, UChicago Medicine, Sutter Health, Yale New Haven Health System, UCI Health, Emory Healthcare, The University of Kansas Health System, UPMC, and many more. Abridge has also formed partnerships with Wolters Kluwer, OpenNotes, and other leading healthcare organizations to enrich the Abridge platform ecosystem. In early 2024, Abridge announced a $150M Series C financing, which included a strategic investment from NVIDIA.\n\nAbout Abridge\n\nAbridge was founded in 2018 to power deeper understanding in healthcare. The AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most—their patients. With support for 28+ languages and 50+ specialties, Abridge is able to support a wide range of clinician and patient encounters.\n\nAbridge’s enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time with deep EMR integrations.

      "# [UNC Health Chooses Abridge to Improve Clinician and Patient Experience](https://www.abridge.com/press-release/unc-health-abridge)\nCHAPEL HILL, NC and SAN FRANCISCO, CA—February 3, 2025—UNC Health, one of the largest and most comprehensive healthcare systems in the southeast, is expanding the use of Abridge AI across its network of thousands of clinicians to improve the patient and clinician experience.\n\n“Abridge is a genuinely transformative technology, and it’s going to be the foundation of what we do going forward,” said Dr. Sachin Gupta, Chief Medical Officer for the UNC Physicians Network. “UNC Health is committed to making our clinicians’ lives easier and to improving the patient and clinician experience. This is a big win for us in those areas. Clinicians and patients who prefer not to use it can opt out, and we chose Abridge in part for its strong policies in protecting patient safety and privacy.”\n\nFollowing a rigorous pilot evaluation involving 100 clinicians across multiple specialties and care settings, UNC Health selected Abridge as the enterprise-wide solution for ambient AI-powered documentation. UNC Health plans to offer the Abridge technology to its physicians and advanced practice providers across North Carolina beginning in early February.\n\n“Our goal is to improve the satisfaction of our clinicians by reducing the time spent on clinical note-taking while maintaining UNC Health's high quality of patient-centered care,” said Dr. Matt Ewend, UNC Health’s Chief Clinical Officer. “As one pilot user noted: ‘It's been a game changer.

      "# [Sutter Health, Abridge expand genAI platform for clinical documentation by Nathan Eddy on 2024-03-29](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/sutter-health-abridge-expand-genai-platform-clinical-documentation)\nSutter Health, one of Northern California's largest healthcare providers, is teaming up with Abridge, a healthcare AI startup focused on clinical documentation, to offer the genAI service to its physicians and clinicians across the state.\n\nThe aim of the technology is to reduce the time required by medical professionals to complete administrative tasks including writing clinical notes.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\nThe Abridge AI platform is tailored for medical conversations and supported by electronic health record integrations. It can convert patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real time.\n\nThe AI-generated summaries are mapped to ground truth with Linked Evidence technology to ensure accuracy.\n\nSutter's partnership with Abridge will also see the integration of patient-facing summaries in the EHR.\n\nFollowing successful implementations at Yale New Haven Health System, UCI Health, Emory Healthcare, the University of Kansas Health System, UPMC and numerous other health systems, Abridge also secured a $150 million Series C financing.\n\nThat included a strategic investment from NVIDIA to expedite a research and development agenda to scale up the clinical conversation platform across the broader U.S. healthcare system.\n\nAbridge uses NVIDIA's latest NIM inference microservices, integrated into the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform and built upon the company's TensorRT large language model to power its deep learning stack.\n\nTHE LARGER TREND\n\nSince 2018, healthcare workforce burnout rates have risen, though they began stabilizing in late 2022, according to a January report from KLAS.\n\nThe use of AI and generative AI could help reduce growing levels of burnout among healthcare professionals.\n\nSome experts have posited that an AI tool capable of generating an initial draft of a SOAP note, for example, which would then be subject to caregiver approval or editing, could significantly reduce clinicians' workload, saving them considerable time.\n\nIn an interview with HealthcareITNews in August 2023, Abridge founder and CEO Dr. Shiv Rao said AI-powered automation could have a huge impact on the demands of manual documentation and coding.\n\n\"If we could provide a magnitude greater speed and lower cost, turning patient conversation into highly professional notes with quality and accuracy, that we could refocus our profession on what matters most – being present and listening,\" he said.\n\nTrained on vast data sets, genAI holds significant promise in data-rich healthcare. An October 2023 report forecast that the technology within healthcare alone would surge to a $22 billion industry by 2032.\n\nThis growth would be aided by the formation of strategic partnerships among a growing cohort of companies integrating solutions into drug discovery, diagnostics, patient care and claims management.\n\nEarlier this month, NVIDIA launched 25 new genAI microservices aimed at diverse healthcare applications to facilitate integration of AI into both cloud-based and on-premises systems, targeting genomics, imaging, drug discovery and other digital health needs.\n\nOracle has also introduced a genAI tool and additional enhancements to its Data Intelligence Cloud Suite, bolstering Oracle Health Data Intelligence with performance enhancements, prebuilt clinical quality analytics and automated alerts to improve reimbursements and care quality.\n\nON THE RECORD\n\n\"We want to support our clinicians so they can sustainably serve our patients,\" said Dr. Albert Chan, Sutter Health's chief health information officer, in a statement about the new genAI work. \"Reducing administrative burden by two to three hours a day with Abridge can reduce the time our clinicians have historically spent away from their families and help our providers recharge and be the best versions of themselves when caring for patients.\"",

      "# [AI’s race to value: A conversation with Abridge, Anthropic, Perplexity, and Scale AI by Ross Matican on 2024-12-10](https://www.bvp.com/atlas/ais-race-to-value-a-conversation-with-abridge-anthropic-perplexity-and-scale-ai)\nWhen we asked top CEOs about the state of the AI market, one sentiment rang clear: “It’s still so early.”\n\nBut if the evolution of the cloud economy taught us anything, tomorrow’s AI giants will be defined by more than just superior technology — they’ll need distribution and sustainable business models. This year, a new generation of AI startups across the model and application layers are exploring innovative approaches to monetization and go-to-market strategies.\n\n\"It's still so early\"\n\nSo, on the Cloud 100 stage, we gathered the leaders shaping the future of artificial intelligence: Daniela Amodei, co-founder and president of Anthropic; Aravind Srinivas, CEO and founder of Perplexity; Shiv Rao, CEO and founder of Abridge; and Alexandr Wang, CEO and founder of Scale AI.\n\nTogether, these top AI leaders shared insights into the realities facing executives and builders today. While the technology advances at breakneck speed, AI adoption faces hurdles: usability, ethical, distribution, and retaining customers.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, startups must focus on niche applications, design user-centric experiences, and navigate the infrastructural complexities required to deliver enterprise-grade solutions. Ultimately, success in the AI space will come down to the ability to compound value over time, adapt to evolving market needs, and carve out meaningful differentiation in an increasingly competitive landscape.\n\nDive into the conversation on the state of the AI industry — quotes have been lightly edited for clarity and concision.\n\nAs capable as AI already is, the tech is still nascent\n\nWhat changed the most about AI in the last few years? Perhaps it’s how user-friendly LLMs have become. Machine learning and algorithms have long been part of the software technology stack. But prior to 2022, they were the provenance of researchers and technical teams. Now, most people use them daily. Perhaps that has caused everyone to think they know something about them. We asked our founders, what do you most wish more people understood about AI right now?\n\nFirst off, there is just how complex and difficult it is to staff a team with the right skill and technology to put an AI tool into market. “I’m not sure people appreciate the amount of alchemy it takes to actually deliver an enterprise-grade solution,” says Shiv Rao, founder and CEO of Abridge, which offers an AI tool for clinicians. “The ingredients range from computer science and data models to input from professors, PhDs, domain experts, and people testing it in the wild.”\n\n\"There is more work ahead of us than behind.\"\n\nDaniela Amodei, founder and president at Anthropic, stresses how much further the industry has to go. “Even though the numbers are staggering, there is more work ahead of us than behind,” she says. At Anthropic, she is thinking hard about what it takes to imbue all the ethics, security, and trust necessary into today’s Claude models.\n\nAlexandr Wang, founder and CEO of Scale AI, which offers AI infrastructure, stresses that the progress is far more rapid than is obvious to consumers. “You should not expect to see any slowdown in the performance of these models,” he says. “It’s an incredible place of technological progress.”\n\nMeanwhile, Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity points out that adoption of intelligent search isn’t where it needs to be. “It’s early, and people are not using these tools regularly. They need to be more intuitive,” he says. “Our goal at Perplexity is to take all the amazing models everybody else builds and shape them into amazing consumer experiences.”\n\nAI is developing faster than industry can absorb it\n\nThere is actually a top speed at which companies can absorb money- and time-saving AI technologies, says Daniela, and we are nearing it.\n\n“We’ll come up with new research areas and interests and features, but then you have to turn them into something that is quickly usable by businesses,” she says. She likens it to working with both your hands, and one of them moving considerably slower than the other.\n\nAlexandr feels that society hasn’t even discovered the best use for AI yet, and to him, that’s an exciting premise. “We don’t yet know the giant, killer applications, and I think that means the infrastructure layer is going to see many more years of growth.” It also coincides, he says, with a renewed period of global and governmental change, which will accentuate institutional interest in AI. “As I see it, the fate of the free world hangs upon whether or not AI is that defining innovation for this era. I really hope governments understand that.”\n\nRegulated industries like healthcare are adopting AI the fastest\n\n“I don’t think any industry is adopting AI as quickly as healthcare right now,” says Shiv. “We are announcing a new health system every week and they are adopting it because we’re in a public health emergency. Two out of five doctors don’t want to be doctors in the next two to three years, and over a quarter of nurses don’t want to be nurses in the 12 months.” That rate of burnout and attrition is causing healthcare organizations to scramble for ways to improve the quality of care and clinician experience.\n\nAbridge, for example, uses generative AI to transform patient-clinician conversations into real-time clinical notes, offering immediate benefits: less documentation, better patient engagement, multilingual support, and improved clinician well-being.\n\n“The most profound feedback we’ve gotten from primary care physicians is that for the first time in their 20-30 year career, they’re making eye contact with patients,” says Shiv.\n\n“We hear the exact same type of stories,” echoes Daniela. “So many healthcare practitioners are exhausted and burned out from administrative work. We’re also seeing industries typically slower to adopt technology flocking to AI. Companies with big, legacy code bases, such as financial services industries, which are built on trust.” In those scenarios, AI means experts can spend time with customers.\n\nIndustries are not monoliths and AI startups are learning to niche down\n\nFounders in a space like healthcare well know, a hospital is not a clinic is not a dental practice is not a medical device supplier. Vertical industries and unique contexts introduce new challenges for AI startups training models on specific data sets to accomplish specific tasks. But it’s also an opportunity to niche down.\n\n“You have those really large health systems and then on the other end, you have the doctor down the street,” says Shiv. They are two very different personas with very different needs,” not to mention tolerances. “In big health systems, the bar for ‘good enough’ is very high. Every doctor there is an ‘edge case assassin’ — you get one thing wrong and you’re dead to them forever. But that doctor down the street, good enough may be enough. They just need relief.”\n\nThe perennial challenge remains: distribution\n\nWhen Aravind first started raising money for Perplexity, he was confident he could build a better product based on a new model that had less of a conflict of interest around the user experience than its established competitors. But a product is not enough, as AI companies learn repeatedly.\n\n“Investors said, yes that is cool but how are you going to get distribution?” recalls Aravind. “This is the often-told story of how Sundar Pichai became the head of Google. Everybody else focused on flashy products, while he focused on getting Chrome to become the dominant browser. This is why we are partnering with telcos, LinkedIn, Uber, and more.”\n\nWhen switching costs are low, experience is everything\n\nAravind sees the value of Perplexity as answering people’s questions better than other search providers. People will settle on the experiences that are the best. “We always pull multiple relevant sources from the web,” he says. “That helps us be far more accurate, especially in matters of real-time knowledge.” That narrow focus has fueled their growth: Last year, they answered 500 million queries, says Aravind. Now they do this on a monthly basis. Meanwhile, they seek to monetize in ways other than the traditional sponsored search engine links — such as sponsored questions, or a publisher program.\n\nBut ultimately, they are just figuring out the details: “It’s an experiment, right?,” says Aravind. “Nobody’s really trying different models outside of subscriptions. Our belief is that if this succeeds, we can compensate content creators too by sharing the ad revenue.”\n\nImmature markets are forgiving of new models\n\nIn mature markets, the go-to-market motions must be more carefully planned. But in a market like today’s — rapidly expanding with unexplored territory — what may matter more is simply getting started.\n\n“We’re so early in the AI industry, I think a lot of business models will work. So will many approaches to getting users,” says Alexandr. “Whether it’s product-led growth, top-down sales, government sales, the model layer, the infrastructure layer, a bit of everything will succeed. If we jump forward 10 years, I think it’s obvious AI will be ubiquitous.” There is, in sum, vast room for growth and many players.\n\nBut as we’ve seen with other technological paradigm shifts, Alexandr thinks the first movers will still hold the advantage in the AI era. He equated these dynamics to the early days of the Internet and the Browser wars. “I talked to a VC about Netscape,” Alexandr says, “who told me, ‘Yeah, we originally thought we were going to monetize with the browser, then Internet Explorer crushed us. We built a wholly new business, servers, and that ended up being way bigger than the browser business we had.’”\n\nThe takeaway? Many major businesses are yet to be discovered as technology evolves and new business models emerge. However, the AI players that establish a foothold in a market and solid distribution early on will secure a competitive edge. They’ll gain the flexibility to explore new monetization strategies and continue growing.\n\nThe best response to the retention challenge? Know thy customer\n\nRetention is a challenge in nearly every digital market, but especially those with low switching costs. How are AI startups retaining those first-time users? Perplexity is focused on getting various cohorts of first-time users to make a second query. “We track two types of retention — by week and by demographics and whether people make another query in their lifetime. Initially, we were at 80%, and I said we need to push this as close to 100% as possible. Then we’ll focus on people making five queries, and it becomes a habit.”\n\nFor Daniela and Anthropic, success is about narrowly knowing and serving their specific audience. “Claude users tend to be highly educated and use it for work or related tasks. So I joke, we’re not in the business of making snowboarding cat videos. Those are very fun. But that’s not what our user base is asking for. They want help with their writing, analyzing information, and looking through legal documents, etc.”\n\nIf competing against a goliath, win on one narrow use case\n\nPerplexity is competing against the largest search engines in existence. How do they plan to win? To compete only in areas where they can win, which deliver incremental value to the user. “One thing is very clear and that’s that we’re not trying to take the navigational behavior away — Googling words like ‘Reddit’ or ‘Costco,’ they can have that. That’s probably a billion searches a day by itself,” says Aravind. Instead, he and the team are targeting the detailed, complex queries where an engine like Perplexity has an advantage. “We would love to be a majority player there.”\n\nThe Perplexity team is also careful to compete on exclusively what matters to their user — the actual experience. “Earlier, whoever tried to take on Google would attack them on privacy or monopoly practices,” says Aravind. “Consumers didn’t really get a differentiated experience from that. But now that's possible because LLMs really started working well on instruction tuning, and conversations, and being able to summarize without hallucinations.” Users are switching for situations where that really does work better.\n\nFor all their differences, every AI startup has two choices\n\n“It’s go public or sell. It’s asymptotic,” says Aravind. “For that, you have to be profitable, or on the path to profitability. It’s better if you don’t have to pump lots of sales motions into that; the margins will be higher. If you can really change people’s daily habits, and the product spreads to a good chunk of the world, and you can monetize a good chunk of those queries, that’s what we’re trying to do.”\n\nMany AI startups have a tailwind in this respect — they benefit from rapid advances infrastructure, from competition driving down the price of models to open source removing barriers. But then the question is, how do you turn that into an advantage over others?\n\n“The question it all comes down to is, can you compound?” asks Alexandr. “AI can. I think that’s what Aravind was getting at. The difference between whether or not you become a trillion-dollar company or not is, do you have the ability to just compound over an extremely long time? And I think that’s very possible with AI.”",
      "# [Abridge Inside from Haiku to Hyperdrive](https://www.abridge.com/press-release/abridge-inside-emory)\nAbridge Inside is the first evidence-based generative AI clinical documentation solution designed for clinicians working within Epic.\n\nPITTSBURGH, PA (February 13, 2024) – Abridge, the leader in evidence-based generative AI for clinical documentation, today announced Abridge Inside—a new offering embedded inside standard Epic workflows. From recording patient conversations in Haiku to embedding AI-generated notes within the patient chart in Hyperdrive, clinicians will be able to harness the power of Abridge from start to finish without ever leaving Epic.\n\nAbridge’s participation in Epic’s recently launched Workshop program unlocks the collaborative power of co-development between Epic and Abridge to more quickly tackle health systems’ most pressing issues. Both Abridge and Epic see ambient listening as a core component of a broader push to help providers improve the care experience with generative AI.\n\nAbridge, led by a practicing cardiologist—Shiv Rao (CEO, co-founder)—will bring its purpose-built AI technology directly inside Epic. The proprietary technology summarizes conversations held in English and over 15 additional languages including Spanish, French, German, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, and Haitian Creole—into English notes. There are more than 15 additional languages in beta today. Additionally, Abridge supports over 50 specialties, helping clinicians care for patients in a variety of care settings. In the Abridge tab within Epic, clinicians now also have complete auditability for the AI-generated summaries using Linked Evidence—map any word or phrase in the note to the source transcript or audio in real-time.\n\n“Workshop was built to accelerate cutting-edge innovation through co-development,” said Garrett Adams, vice president of research and development at Epic. “At Epic, we believe in responsible AI that is auditable and transparent, and Abridge is a great example of a company that prioritizes that.”\n\nWith over a million notes generated, Abridge is deployed in leading health systems across the country including Emory Healthcare, The University of Kansas Health System, and UPMC, who have all chosen to integrate the transformative solution within their Epic environment.\n\nIn August 2023, Emory announced an enterprise-wide agreement, making Abridge the generative AI solution for all of their 3,450 clinicians. Just months later, there is already a tangible impact on the day-to-day workflow and well-being of clinicians at Emory, who use Abridge within Epic across several specialties and locations.\n\n“Now I’m able to look at the patient and talk to them in the room without thinking about documentation,” said Payaswini Vasanth, MD, Transplant Nephrologist, Emory Healthcare. “I’ve been able to save more time than I ever imagined. I never take work home. As soon as I’m done seeing a patient, I finish writing my note, then review and edit the note to finalize it.”\n\nVIDEO: Emory leaders and clinicians share the impact of Abridge on their work and life.\n\n‍\n\n“We are investing in technology that makes patient care better and also makes the lives of our healthcare workforce better,” said Joon Lee, MD, Chief Executive Officer, Emory Healthcare.\n\nLearn more about Abridge Inside live at ViVe (Feb 25-28) in Los Angeles or HIMSS (March 11-15) in Orlando.
