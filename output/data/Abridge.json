      "# Post ID 1deibuu: AI scribing so far—what works and what's missing? with +29 score by [(markatdaily, Reddit, 2024-06-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/)\nFull disclosure: I am a software product lead working on solutions tailored for healthcare providers. My primary goal is to offload administrative tasks and streamline workflows to give providers more time to focus on patient care and ultimately improve health outcomes.\n\nWith the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI scribing has gained significant traction. Numerous products are now available to assist with clinical documentation. For those who have integrated these tools into their practice, I’d love to hear your experiences:\n\n1. **Reliability**: Have the AI scribing tools proven reliable enough for you to trust them in your daily practice?\n2. **Missing Features**: What key features do you feel are lacking in the current offerings?\n3. **Integration**: Many providers emphasize the importance of EHR integration. How effectively have these integrations saved you time and streamlined your workflow?\n4. **Impact on Patient Care**: Have you observed any changes, whether positive or negative, in patient care or your interactions with patients since adopting AI scribing tools?\n5. **Training and Support**: How would you rate the training and support provided for these tools? Are there any additional resources or improvements that you believe would be helpful?\n\nI am here not to promote a specific product, but rather to learn about what works well and what falls short. I hope this discussion will also benefit others who are developing software tools for healthcare providers. Your insights will be invaluable in helping us create solutions that genuinely support the needs of healthcare professionals.\n\nThank you in advance for your feedback and insights!\n\n## Comment ID l8cg6pn with +47 score by [(grey-doc, Reddit, 2024-06-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8cg6pn/) (in reply to ID 1deibuu):\nDeepscribe - just not a great product and horribly overpriced.  Human transcriber reviews notes, it takes quite a while for the notes to come back.  Human editors are quite apparent in the note quality.  \n\nFreed - a real AI service.  Quick and efficient.  Almost no features, but it doesn't need much.  Often includes what I saw as if the patient says it, not great.\n\nHeidi - almost perfect.  Like actually almost perfect, out of the box.  The phrasing in notes is terse and \"medical\" without excessive verbosity.  The generation is A+ with great settings on variability.  Hallucination rate is low, context understanding is unsettlingly high.  Only caveat is the website is a little heavy, can be a touch slow on a tablet or phone.\n\nWhat's missing...not much.  Heidi gets it good.  Integration in EMR maybe, but copy and paste works great.  I would have a hard time doing better than Heidi and I say this as a software engineer with very high standards.\n\nNote that all notes require careful review.  These models do occasionally misinterpret and hallucinate.  Of note, if Heidi gets it wrong, you can easily regenerate the note and it will often do a better job, which is nice.\n\nThe hallucination in Heidi is really interesting.  Sometimes it will hallucinate something into the A&P that we didn't talk about which is clinically relevant and we SHOULD have talked about.  A couple times I've called the patient in the evening to talk about it, even.  Go figure. Wouldn't have expected it to be a clinical decision informer but sometimes it is.  Frankly I kinda enjoy going through the notes, it's an interesting second opinion and review of the visit.\n\nI don't mean to rain on your parade but this is the truth.\n\nThe next untouched AI tool is something to query the medical record, \"has patient X ever been tested for hepatitis\" or \"has anyone tried to find out why their alkaline phosphatase is high.\" Or using AI to navigate MIPS and insurance prior auths.\n\n### Comment ID l8cmrab with +14 score by [(DrMo-UC, Reddit, 2024-06-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8cmrab/) (in reply to ID l8cg6pn):\n>The next untouched AI tool is something to query the medical record, \"has patient X ever been tested for hepatitis\" or \"has anyone tried to find out why their alkaline phosphatase is high.\"\n\nIt's the only AI tool I need for which actually doesn't even have to be AI.\n\n#### Comment ID l8ff9vl with +3 score by [(MarcoGalletti, Reddit, 2024-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8ff9vl/) (in reply to ID l8cmrab):\nHi OP, I would not say that it is untouched.

In my experience, LLMs \\_want\\_ to give you this information and you have to carefully craft your prompt to have it withhold this information. The idea being that the AI scribe is to summarize the conversation into clinical notes and not offer clinical decision support. But, clearly it's an area where AI, in general, not just LLMs can deliver.\n\n> The next untouched AI tool is something to query the medical record, \"has patient X ever been tested for hepatitis\" or \"has anyone tried to find out why their alkaline phosphatase is high.\"\n\nWould this be physician led or surfaced by the software, in your opinion?\n\n#### Comment ID l8exz11 with +2 score by [(grey-doc, Reddit, 2024-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8exz11/) (in reply to ID l8ex83x):\nThe Heidi templates are prompts which are crafted to avoid this hallucination but it still leaks through sometimes.

The integration is a huge time saver. Not having to copy/paste saves a lot of time. Overall, the AI quality is good, and I like the AVS that it generates as a patient-level recap of the visit. The only issue has been needing to recap the visit at the end for a more accurate A&P. I like to do it in the room, but often, the patient constantly interrupts with comments that may or may not be related. It has captured some diagnoses or topics for the plan. I remember we talked about them in the room but forgot to write them down, so that has been good. There are rare hallucinations in the notes. More it is that the AI includes small topics that the patient mentioned, but I don't feel they are worth having in the notes.\n\n  \nThe biggest AI need, however, is software to OCR the digital PDF archives, combine them with the CareEverywhere documentation and clinic documentation, and create a nice patient overview.\n\n### Comment ID l8eybd2 with +2 score by [(markatdaily, Reddit, 2024-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8eybd2/) (in reply to ID l8diu3i):\n> The only issue has been needing to recap the visit at the end for a more accurate A&P.

They perform the same way every single time. Crash some but not horrible. The problem is, consistently mediocre is still mediocre. They do reliable listen and transcribe - I cannot say much bad about this. They are accurate in simply getting conversation into the program. \n\nOne major problem for me is syntax. The end result is written in a way that I don’t find attractive or natural. Feels more bulky. Too wordy. “The patient” over and over. Tries to use big words that are never used in an HPI. Just seems forced. Although information is correct, it comes across in a way I don’t like and I’m too anal to leave it. Sometimes wont filter out information. Throws an entire paragraph about the patients ski trip last year that is irrelevant to current complaint of gout. \n\nIntegration is key. Proof and edit is going to be needed. But if it takes multiple steps or another program to access the AI generated information, then it’s not saving you as much time as it promises. Just more clicks to copy paste and so forth. In my opinion any program that doesn’t integrate directly into your note is useless in my opinion. \n\nKeying up orders would be helpful but take some work. Would never be perfect. I would like more ability to edit the product to be something closer to how I prefer to write. \n\nImpact on patient care? So far for me…more eye contact. That’s about it. \n\nTraining should be focused on teaching users what words and phrases to use to help the program out. To help get the right information into the exam vs the assessment and plan. To get the right diagnoses etc. The goal should be less editing. The result should be 90% done. But it’s nowhere close for me personally. \n\nThese have potential, but we are a long ways away from where they’ll have to be to be used widely across specialties, doc, systems, etc. \n\nFor the record, my experience is with DAX.\n\n### Comment ID l8cf8jc with +7 score by [(grey-doc, Reddit, 2024-06-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8cf8jc/) (in reply to ID l8cbx7u):\nTry Heidi with the \"brief\" or \"Goldilocks\" verbosity setting.

I have written a script to anonymize the transcripts, which I then send to chatgpt for note creation. \n\nThe prompt I'm using to create the note is a bit of a work in progress. Overall, it is successful in creating what I need about 95% of the time. It certainly shortens the time I spend writing notes. \n\nHowever, a 5% error rate is still 1 in 20, and I have to review the notes very carefully before finalizing them. \n\nSo far what has not yet been successful is creating an organized task list for the patient in myself for future follow-up. \n\nAnother interesting aspect of my practice, being cash only, is that I have no particular billing or coding requirements, and the structure of my notes has changed dramatically from the soap note that I was taught in residency. My visits are also an hour or more in length, and cover topics ranging from emotional processing to relationships to lab results to longevity studies. \n\nI'm very curious about how a commercial product like Heidi would perform with my very \"non medical\" conversational topics with patients.\n\nSo far the prompt I have crafted and tweaked is doing well at creating a note that I find useful and serviceable. \n\nThe biggest issue is when it misses something that I know I talked about with the patient, and I have to search the transcript to find it.\n\n### Comment ID l8ere5m with +2 score by [(Harvard_Med_USMLE265, Reddit, 2024-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8ere5m/) (in reply to ID l8dpgum):\nWould you be willing to share your prompt?

Though, you'd need to sign a BAA with OpenAI or Microsoft, which they're generally only willing to do for larger organizations or those with an existing relationship.\n\n#### Comment ID l8fcmdd with +1 score by [(Harvard_Med_USMLE265, Reddit, 2024-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8fcmdd/) (in reply to ID l8ez7md):\nThe solution is Gen AI for both. Transcription is easy, I already have an app to do that. \n\nSummarization is just a prompt - but interested if anyone has already had success, as a starting point. \n\nAs a test, I’m currently getting ChatGPT to roleplay the patient, and I’m going to see if I can transcribe and summarize the consult. I’m just not an expert on what format current commercial software uses when summarizing, as I;ve never used Heidi et al \n\nIf anyone has an existing prompt for med record summarization I would love to see it.\n\n#### Comment ID l8gymfp with +1 score by [(athos786, Reddit, 2024-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8gymfp/) (in reply to ID l8ez7md):\nGoogle workspace is HIPAA compliant (will sign BAA, one click).

      "# Post ID 1b0befu: Best AI medical scribe tools? Do people use them? with +84 score by [(guiltless_inaccuracy, Reddit, 2024-02-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/)\nPhysician in a small clinic here. My practice has been looking into these new AI medical scribes to help with our clinical documentation. Everyone’s pretty burned out from spending so much time on patient notes, so this seems like a really interesting solution. Are these tools safe & legit?\n\nI wanted to try DeepScribe and DAX but it seems like you have to go through sales. A friend recommended NoteMD and I’ve been trying it out for a few days. So far it’s pretty good (it doesn’t save patient recordings which is great), but sometimes it doesn’t capture a sentence or two.\n\nWhat do people think about using these? Are they safe?\n\nEDIT: Thanks all for your comments, please stop spamming me in DMs :-) Our practice ended up with NoteMD which is working great.\n\n## Comment ID ks7b78p with +34 score by [(DrTestificate_MD, Reddit, 2024-02-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7b78p/) (in reply to ID 1b0befu):\nYes some people are using them. Permanente ran a pilot study making it available to 10000 docs and a significant percentage of them used it for over 100 encounters over a 4 week period.

Captures most of what is said and knows where to put it (History, exam, A/P, PI etc). Produces paragraphs of prose.

Takes me 2 min to write my own primary care notes (after a little pre-charting.) When an AI model can read my previous notes and learn how I document and reproduce my style then I’ll use it.

Or do these just work for for ftf visits? So far I can just get the Mac dictation function to recognize my voice- not the patients voice- so wondering how a scribe would even “hear” the patient - thanks!\n\n### Comment ID kuajtlo with +2 score by [(LordVile37, Reddit, 2024-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/kuajtlo/) (in reply to ID kuabc6t):\nHey there! I'm part of the product team here at [Heidi](https://www.heidihealth.com/)!\n\nPsychiatrists & psychologists make up a large % of our users. We've worked hard at making Heidi robust and able to sift through just about any non-relevant information that happens in a visit.\n\nUnlike all the other AI scribes out there, we've made what they all do, FREE, and some features unique to us available with a subscription (still cheaper than them). Things like \"Ask AI\" \\~ your AI personal assistant, ask it to generate documents, split notes, ask billing codes, return your transcript etc, the sky is the limit.\n\nYou can use this over zoom \\~ you'll just have to play audio out loud and it will capture everything quite well. Sharing audio between softwares is tricky from an eng POV but it is something on our roadmap, we just want to make sure it's 🤌 before a major rollout.\n\nLet us know how you go, you'll get Heidi Pro as a free trial upon signup so play around with it as much as you like.\n\n#### Comment ID kue872b with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/kue872b/) (in reply to ID kuajtlo):\nMax friendly?

They have a live scribe on with you all day to do your orders, coding, mapping diagnosis, etch and then the AI listens to your conversation that you have with the patient to capture the visit and then produces the note.  The live scribe imports the note to the chart.  It works great and the providers love it.  The scribes are off shore so the cost is low.  The AI note outputs are quite impressive and having a real person help the doctors made adoption very easy.

It gives you a gender neutral HPI (i.e. uses \"they/them\" pronouns) as well as mental status exam (I'm in psychiatry) and plan.  The MSE and plan are useless, at least for me. The HPI is decent.\n\nFreed doesn't show you a transcription live but you can access it afterwards. It gives a better HPI than Nabla and you can choose gender so it sounds better than using \"they/them\" all over. It also does a more honest job at the MSE; basically never attempts to write one and says \"not enough objective data.\" It also gives a plan and after visit summary. Both are really solid. Anything you say during the appointment in terms of plan, it'll capture. If I mention diet and exercise, it'll put in specifically what I said rather than just say \"lifestyle changes\". I have a template for plan that I prefer using so I don't actually use that part but I could easily see someone finding it useful (unlike Nabla where I don't think most people would find the generated plan sufficient). The after visit summary is gold though. Writes instructions as a letter from you to the patient, with an easy to read list of what was talked about during the appointment. \n\nIf they cut the price in half, I'd recommend Freed without any doubt. I wouldn't say it's worth a $100 a month though, especially since Nabla is free and the HPI is the main thing you want from an AI anyway, not plan or AVS.\n\n#### Comment ID k20c8mu with +9 score by [(blade24, Reddit, 2023-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k20c8mu/) (in reply to ID k1y3r77):\nWhat are the legal ramifications of these?

For some types of visits like well child checks, or preops I will use my old dot phrases. But for the regular visit with “multiple concerns” or chronic care, it has been saving me soooo. Much. Time.\n\nI often get compliments from my patients that I’m the only one who truly ever listened to them. However in doing so I often sacrificed my chance at admin time… and honestly was heading for burnout. \n\nNow I feel able to relax and just worry about the patient in from of me, and not have to be looking at the screen typing things to jog my memory later on. I no longer am needing to work from home multiple night a week after 10h at clinic. I can spend time with my family and have more time and energy to do things that are healthy for me. \n\nHonestly, life changing.\n\n### Comment ID kg1nkw8 with +1 score by [(Educational_Shoe5614, Reddit, 2024-01-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/kg1nkw8/) (in reply to ID kdugsuy):\nThat's amazing, congrats\n\n## Comment ID kgcl6gc with +2 score by [(elietoubi, Reddit, 2024-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/kgcl6gc/) (in reply to ID 16qm7ji):\nHey,  \nYou might want to check [scribemd.ai](https://scribemd.ai)  \nit's free to use and works great. you can see a demo here:   \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJOzQHYbv2o\n\n### Comment ID kgcrcha with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/kgcrcha/) (in reply to ID kgcl6gc):\nThanks, I'll check it out!\n\n#### Comment ID kh662yd with +2 score by [(elietoubi, Reddit, 2024-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/kh662yd/) (in reply to ID kgcrcha):\nwould love your feedback :D   \nMy email is elie(at)scribemd.ai\n\n## Comment ID ktnq70q with +1 score by [(ekwcq, Reddit, 2024-03-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/ktnq70q/) (in reply to ID 16qm7ji):\nHi! I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers. Full HIPAA compliance and patient information is protected.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more! You can also shoot me an email ernest.chan@getathelas.com and I'd be happy to chat more.\n\n## Comment ID k23jy34 with +1 score by [(toastycitrus, Reddit, 2023-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k23jy34/) (in reply to ID 16qm7ji):\nEdit\n\n### Comment ID ki1hlaw with +1 score by [(Emotional_Walrus_782, Reddit, 2024-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/ki1hlaw/) (in reply to ID k23jy34):\nCan actually do this with Heidi.

I consistently get a note that takes \\~30 seconds to edit. \\~$130/month  \n\n\nScribematic: Just started trying this out. Seems to be the best quality and pretty user friendly. You can give it templates to incorporate for each section of your exam. It has a well developed UI. Most importantly it learns from the changes you make (I don't know if anyone else does this). Downside is it's $400/mo  \n\n\nDAX/Nuance: Was not impressed. No free trial. You have to spend \\~$1200 for them to onboard you for a month then it's $700/mo after that ($600 + $100 for dragon).

I’ve been using Suki. It has direct access to my EMR and schedule so it’s as simple as clicking the patients name and starting the “note”. I access it through my phone and leave the phone near the patient and myself. It then processes the ramblings (I can be all over the place sometimes) of the visit and manages to organize it into HPI and a/p VERY accurately and in better detail than what I would normally do without it. It also does physical exam and other things like patient instructions but you’d need to speak out the physical exam which is weird. It has been life changing because it takes away the mental burden of documenting after seeing patients. I often do all my notes at lunch and then after the afternoon session because it allows me to stay on time and focus on the patient. Knowing all the details are being captured and all I need to do is organize the note a little is FANTASTIC. It requires so much less brain power than formulating the note and truly does it so well.\n\nCurrently offered by my practice but it’s 400 a month which is pricey.

There’s a list of patients there where you just hit the copy button and ctrl V directly in your EMR of choice. You make and edit charts using your phone app, the AI can be used as dictation or can ambiently listen to the conversation and have the portions of the chart completed when you get back to your desk. You can talk to the ai to amend to chart itself if you find anything you don’t like instead of having to type corrections or to add additional information.

To give an example, I work in addiction treatment where you have to document group with 10 people. A reasonable chart would be quite short especially if the pt engaged in group positively. Insurance wants a novel and will find any excuse to deny a claim. So the new AI in EMRs will basically fluff out chart notes - it will use 3-4 words where 1 suffices, it will include long summaries of past notes, it will reiterate things from the pt’s history and demographics.\n\nAddiction treatment is probably like many other conditions where you have a problem: if you chart that the person is doing better, insurance will say they don’t need treatment anymore. If you chart that they aren’t doing better, they will say it’s not effective and they don’t need treatment anymore. So you also have to extensively document to somehow prove they still need treatment even though the treatment is working.\n\n#### Comment ID m618qzs with +1 score by [(A313-Isoke, Reddit, 2025-01-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthcare/comments/1huzkou/ai_may_listen_in_on_your_next_doctors_appointment/m618qzs/) (in reply to ID m5wo08c):\nThank you, that's a great example.

It's the worst out of all the AI scribes. They have to be giving some kickback to organizations because I've seen them go from unknown to being the most talked about option in a matter of a couple weeks. The fact that your organization is making up some BS excuse of \"don't get your own because of reasons\" just solidifies by theory that Abridge is doing something shady to get more market share. Like you said, the software is not integrated into the EMR so no AI scribe is inherently worse than the other, so long as they're all adhering to HIPAA.\n\n### Comment ID k70f4ip with +1 score by [(Unusual_Moose9741, Reddit, 2023-10-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/17h3wai/ai_scribe_personal_vs_institutional_use/k70f4ip/) (in reply to ID k704nnq):\nWhat about it don’t you like?\n\n#### Comment ID k70j5hp with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-10-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/17h3wai/ai_scribe_personal_vs_institutional_use/k70j5hp/) (in reply to ID k70f4ip):\nSo many things. \n\nForces you to use a secondary device. So you have to give it access to all sorts of privacy requests on your iPhone/iPad. Then it's a significantly longer workflow of opening up their website on your phone, waiting for the note to populate, then copy/paying into your EMR. Compared to most AI's where it's just another tab that's sitting in the background. \n\nThe other big issue with Abridge is that they store audio recordings of your appointment. That's an absolute no-go for me. There are massive legal repercussions to that. My patients have consented to a virtual AI scribe. They did not consent to have our appointments recorded and turned over to a for-profit AI company. Not to mention, they're very opaque about what they're going to do with the audio recordings. I strongly suspect that they're going to be using the audio recordings for their own monetization purposes. Frankly, wouldn't surprise me if their business model is actually focused on making use of these audio recordings rather than getting money from the AI scribe aspect itself. \n\nTheir AI scribe itself is also inferior to others out there. Can't even pick gender in your patient notes.\n\n## Comment ID ku6md7w with +2 score by [(ComdrFury, Reddit, 2024-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/17h3wai/ai_scribe_personal_vs_institutional_use/ku6md7w/) (in reply to ID 17h3wai):\nI have tried mpilo (https://mpilo.ai), which looks amazing and quite easy to use.

I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nYou can shoot me an email ernest.chan@getathelas.com and I'd be happy to chat more.",

Its an AI scribe that writes your notes based on minimal text or audio input related to a case.  It's HIPAA compliant and works with any EMR.

It's a place where my healthcare experience is valued while I get to explore the exciting world of AI.\n\nInclusive and Diverse Culture: The company truly embraces diversity. During my interview process, I felt comfortable sharing my identity as a queer person and felt genuinely accepted. Abridge encourages everyone to show up as their authentic selves.\n\nExceptional Colleagues: I'm surrounded by brilliant minds – clinicians, scientists, and engineers. It's easy for someone in my role to feel inferior to these brilliant individuals but they've never made me feel that way. Every voice and experience is valued here.\n\nInspiring Leadership: The leadership team embodies Abridge's values, particularly in honoring humanity. They make every team member feel seen and heard, regardless of their position.\n\nCompetitive Compensation: In my career across multiple companies, Abridge offers the highest compensation I've received. For a Customer Support Specialist role, the salary is remarkably generous.\n\nComprehensive Benefits: The healthcare benefits are impressive. I have affordable copays, zero deductible for in-network PCPs, and the convenience of having medical, dental, and vision under one insurance provider.\n\nInvestment in Personal Growth: Abridge's new learning and professional development program provides an annual budget for skill enhancement, professional coaching, and certifications. This commitment to employee growth is exciting for a lifelong learner like me.\n\nMeaningful Work: Being part of a company that's shaping the future of healthcare AI gives a sense of purpose to my daily work.",

At least one leader sends inappropriate and creepy messages to their female employees but the fear of retaliation keep these women quiet. \n\nThe company’s mission is to reduce healthcare worker burnout, but if employees are not working every late night, weekend and throughout their vacation, they will be fired. While some teams are inclusive and less toxic than others, burnout is a central theme at every level. \n\nPeople don’t trust each other and are afraid to speak up, so slack is filled with shout outs praise, and a ton of self promotion, but if you speak one on one with someone, beneath the surface, people are afraid and miserable.\n\nThe company’s internal motto is to work as fast and as much as possible to win, even at the expense of smart decisions, creativity, individuality, diversity, and most of all - health and wellbeing. Employees are required to give out their personal contact information and much of the demands happen off work channels. Phones are busy with texts and calls throughout all hours of the night and morning and if you put up boundaries, you’re seen as not being passionate enough about the company and its mission.",

However, I choose to remain anonymous to protect my identity. One major challenge we faced was the severe lack of revenue, which put an immense amount of stress on the business as a whole. This financial strain impacted various aspects of the company's operations, contributing to an overall atmosphere of uncertainty. Moreover, a noticeable power struggle was eminent among the top-level executives, which negatively affected decision-making processes and hindered progress. It was disheartening to witness how this internal struggle trickled down and impacted the overall work environment. Regrettably, the company recently resorted to implementing secretive layoffs. Disconcertingly, both employees who had been with the organization for a few months and those with many years of service were affected. This sudden downsizing not only caused disruption but also undermined employee morale, creating a sense of uncertainty and job insecurity among the workforce. Additionally, I observed a steady decline in the people culture within the organization. The once supportive and collaborative atmosphere had deteriorated, leading to a less comfortable and engaging work environment.",

Your feedback is incredibly valuable in helping us understand how we can continuously strive to provide a better experience for all of our current and future employees.\n\nWe know it can be challenging in the early stages of building a product and a company.

This financial strain impacted various aspects of the company's operations, contributing to an overall atmosphere of uncertainty. Moreover, a noticeable power struggle was eminent among the top-level executives, which negatively affected decision-making processes and hindered progress. It was disheartening to witness how this internal struggle trickled down and impacted the overall work environment. Regrettably, the company recently resorted to implementing secretive layoffs. Disconcertingly, both employees who had been with the organization for a few months and those with many years of service were affected. This sudden downsizing not only caused disruption but also undermined employee morale, creating a sense of uncertainty and job insecurity among the workforce. Additionally, I observed a steady decline in the people culture within the organization. The once supportive and collaborative atmosphere had deteriorated, leading to a less comfortable and engaging work environment.",

      "# [Abridge Emerges as a Healthcare AI Leader, Raising $150M](https://www.abridge.com/press-release/series-c-150)\nPITTSBURGH, PA (February 23, 2024) – Abridge, the leader in generative AI for clinical documentation, announced an additional $150 million investment, leveraging momentum from their product’s rapid uptake among health systems throughout the nation. This raise comes just 4 months after their $30M Series B, and is one of the largest funding rounds made to date in generative AI for healthcare.\n\nThe Series C investment was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, who will also join the board. Other new and existing investors continuing to support the company include co-lead Redpoint Ventures, with support from IVP, Spark Capital, Union Square Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Wittington Ventures, Mass General Brigham Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation Fund (AIDIF), Kaiser Permanente Ventures, and CVS Health Ventures.\n\nToday, Abridge also announced a new enterprise agreement with the Yale New Haven Health System, the largest and most comprehensive healthcare system in Connecticut, that will give thousands of clinicians access to Abridge for clinical documentation. Yale New Haven Health has selected Abridge as their generative AI partner in this area of ambient listening. The initial deployment will be focused on reducing the cognitive burden of clinical documentation, enabling clinicians to spend more face-to-face time engaging with patients instead of computers.\n\n“Freeing doctors from the burden of documentation will dramatically improve both quality of care and the doctor-patient relationship,” said Paul Ricci, Advisor, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and former Chairman and CEO of Nuance Communications. “Abridge will allow caregivers to capture an enormous amount of data that is currently being discarded or ignored, and that in turn will likely lead to new insights in managing population health. I’m thrilled to work with Dr. Rao and his team on the next great step in the evolution of healthcare.”\n\n“Abridge has set new standards for quality and responsible deployment of generative AI in health systems across the U.S., cementing it as the industry’s most trusted AI platform,” said Sebastian Duesterhoeft, Partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. “Abridge stands out for their innovation in all facets of product development. CTO Zack Lipton, a widely cited Associate Professor at Carnegie Mellon and pioneer in responsible AI research, has assembled the strongest research team in healthcare AI. They have set new expectations for transparency and verification with their evidence extraction technology, and raised the bar for both note quality and evaluation methodology.”\n\nAbridge has been assembling a world-class AI team for years and these investments are rapidly hitting production. In the last year alone, they delivered an industry-leading automatic speech recognition engine purpose-built for healthcare applications. Their speech and language technologies have been rigorously evaluated in 14 languages and functionally support many more—performing well even amidst rapid switches between languages and when interpreters are in the room. Abridge is ahead of the market in controlling its full technology pipeline, developing its own purpose-built LLMs. Moreover, its “Linked Evidence” feature, a first-of-its kind technology that maps any highlighted region within a summary to the substantiating evidence in the source transcript (and thus to the underlying audio) has become a required capability. The company is actively developing novel ways to personalize notes, integrate more deeply into the EMR, and provide clinicians with after-visit insights.\n\nWith this new capital, Abridge will continue to push boldly into fundamental research, developing bedrock foundation models that draw upon vast troves of multimodal healthcare data. These models will both power improvements to Abridge’s existing product lines and enable a new wave of possibilities in the future.\n\n“We are grateful to be partnering with iconic institutions that share our dedication to improving the lives of patients and clinicians,” said Dr. Shiv Rao, CEO and Founder of Abridge. “This company was founded on the premise that clinician-patient conversations are at the core of all healthcare. Already, this information is powering a revolution in AI-based documentation. In the future, it will open new pathways to improve patient outcomes. Realizing this vision requires world-class talent and formidable compute resources. We are now uniquely positioned to build the AI platform that brings this vision to life.”\n\nAbout Abridge\n\nAbridge was founded in 2018 with the mission of powering deeper understanding in healthcare. The AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most—their patients.\n\nAbridge’s enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time with deep EMR integrations. Powered by Linked Evidence and their auditable AI, Abridge is the only company that maps AI-generated summaries to ground truth, helping providers quickly trust and verify the output. As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, Abridge is setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.\n\nContact",
      "# [Abridge, Mayo Clinic, Epic to Develop a Nursing AI Solution](https://www.abridge.com/press-release/abridge-mayo-epic)\nPITTSBURGH, PA. and SAN FRANCISCO, CA., July 23, 2024—Today, Abridge, Mayo Clinic, and Epic announced a generative AI ambient documentation workflow for nurses. This collaboration will put cutting-edge solutions in the hands of nurses. Powered by Epic, Abridge’s new product combines the strength of Abridge’s generative AI platform with seamless integration into existing Epic nursing workflows.\n\nDeveloped as part of the next phase of collaboration in the Epic Workshop program, which intends to bring new and innovative technologies to the healthcare industry, Abridge, Epic, and Mayo Clinic will work in collaboration with Mayo’s nurses to prioritize the workflows where this tool will have the highest impact. Nurses at Mayo will be instrumental in designing and testing this solution, which works alongside Abridge’s doctor-facing documentation product.\n\n“At the center of this collaboration is Mayo Clinic nursing staff,” said Ryannon Frederick, M.S., R.N., chief nursing officer, Mayo Clinic. “We are engaging them directly in the development of this technology to ensure its use meets the unique needs of nursing and patient care workflows along with regulatory requirements for ambient solutions. We are thrilled to bring the knowledge and expertise of our nursing staff to help shape the future of documentation, where documentation could happen automatically and organically.”\n\nNursing workflows often uniquely encompass a fast-paced, continuous, and wide-ranging scope of activities, potentially involving several patients and hundreds of tasks. The day-to-day can involve patient and team-based communication, clinical notetaking, and data capture. Abridge, Epic, and Mayo Clinic worked together to identify the highest-impact areas for the application of this technology.\n\n“The combined efforts and expertise of Abridge’s AI technology, Epic’s development, and Mayo Clinic’s nursing practice expertise will help us rapidly develop and iterate on this technology to meet our nursing workforce and patient’s needs,” said Edwina Bhaskaran, M.S.N., R.N., chief clinical systems and informatics officer, Mayo Clinic. ”This technology will be shaped using the expertise of nurses that care for patients every single day. Our collective goal is to get a tool into the hands of our nurses before the end of the year.”\n\n“The extension of our platform with a dedicated nursing product that works inside Epic inpatient workflows will help address the growing administrative burden on nurses across the country,” said Dr. Shiv Rao, CEO and Founder of Abridge.\n\n“This collaborative work holds the potential to rethink how nurses document in an electronic health record today by bringing the voice of the patient and the nurse directly into the record,” said Emily Barey, Vice President of Nursing at Epic. “We know that every conversation is crucial to getting the best outcomes and we’re excited about our role as a trusted assistant that can turn those conversations into action so that nurses can give the care they want to give.”\n\nThis news follows successful deployments of Abridge at University of Vermont Health Network, CHRISTUS Health, UChicago Medicine, Sutter Health, Yale New Haven Health System, UCI Health, Emory Healthcare, The University of Kansas Health System, UPMC, and dozens of other health systems. Abridge recently announced a $150M Series C financing, which includes a strategic investment from NVIDIA.\n\nAbout Abridge\n\nAbridge was founded in 2018 with the mission of powering deeper understanding in healthcare.

      "# [Sutter Health, Abridge expand genAI platform for clinical documentation by Nathan Eddy on 2024-03-29](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/sutter-health-abridge-expand-genai-platform-clinical-documentation)\nSutter Health, one of Northern California's largest healthcare providers, is teaming up with Abridge, a healthcare AI startup focused on clinical documentation, to offer the genAI service to its physicians and clinicians across the state.\n\nThe aim of the technology is to reduce the time required by medical professionals to complete administrative tasks including writing clinical notes.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\nThe Abridge AI platform is tailored for medical conversations and supported by electronic health record integrations. It can convert patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real time.\n\nThe AI-generated summaries are mapped to ground truth with Linked Evidence technology to ensure accuracy.\n\nSutter's partnership with Abridge will also see the integration of patient-facing summaries in the EHR.\n\nFollowing successful implementations at Yale New Haven Health System, UCI Health, Emory Healthcare, the University of Kansas Health System, UPMC and numerous other health systems, Abridge also secured a $150 million Series C financing.\n\nThat included a strategic investment from NVIDIA to expedite a research and development agenda to scale up the clinical conversation platform across the broader U.S. healthcare system.\n\nAbridge uses NVIDIA's latest NIM inference microservices, integrated into the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform and built upon the company's TensorRT large language model to power its deep learning stack.\n\nTHE LARGER TREND\n\nSince 2018, healthcare workforce burnout rates have risen, though they began stabilizing in late 2022, according to a January report from KLAS.\n\nThe use of AI and generative AI could help reduce growing levels of burnout among healthcare professionals.\n\nSome experts have posited that an AI tool capable of generating an initial draft of a SOAP note, for example, which would then be subject to caregiver approval or editing, could significantly reduce clinicians' workload, saving them considerable time.\n\nIn an interview with HealthcareITNews in August 2023, Abridge founder and CEO Dr. Shiv Rao said AI-powered automation could have a huge impact on the demands of manual documentation and coding.\n\n\"If we could provide a magnitude greater speed and lower cost, turning patient conversation into highly professional notes with quality and accuracy, that we could refocus our profession on what matters most – being present and listening,\" he said.\n\nTrained on vast data sets, genAI holds significant promise in data-rich healthcare. An October 2023 report forecast that the technology within healthcare alone would surge to a $22 billion industry by 2032.\n\nThis growth would be aided by the formation of strategic partnerships among a growing cohort of companies integrating solutions into drug discovery, diagnostics, patient care and claims management.\n\nEarlier this month, NVIDIA launched 25 new genAI microservices aimed at diverse healthcare applications to facilitate integration of AI into both cloud-based and on-premises systems, targeting genomics, imaging, drug discovery and other digital health needs.\n\nOracle has also introduced a genAI tool and additional enhancements to its Data Intelligence Cloud Suite, bolstering Oracle Health Data Intelligence with performance enhancements, prebuilt clinical quality analytics and automated alerts to improve reimbursements and care quality.\n\nON THE RECORD\n\n\"We want to support our clinicians so they can sustainably serve our patients,\" said Dr. Albert Chan, Sutter Health's chief health information officer, in a statement about the new genAI work. \"Reducing administrative burden by two to three hours a day with Abridge can reduce the time our clinicians have historically spent away from their families and help our providers recharge and be the best versions of themselves when caring for patients.\"",

      "# [How Abridge became one of the most talked about healthcare AI startups by Marina Temkin on 2024-06-18](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/18/how-abridge-became-one-of-the-most-talked-about-healthcare-ai-startups/)\nAsk any of the health-focused VCs to name one of the top AI startups and one name comes up over and over again: a company based in Pittsburgh called Abridge. And it’s a startup that launched before OpenAI was a household name and large language models (LLMs) entered the common Valley vocabulary.\n\nIn 2019, Shiv Rao, a practicing cardiologist, pitched Andy Weissman, general partner at Union Square Ventures (USV), on a startup idea. Rao called it SoundCloud plus RapGenius for medicine.\n\nWhile Weissman thought that comparing a nascent AI-powered medical note-taking app with music hosting and lyrics transcription was a little humorous, the concept resonated with him.\n\nRao explained that doctors spend up to two hours a day — typically outside of regular working hours — typing notes that summarize what was discussed with their patients that day. Such administrative tasks have been causing physician burnout for years, leading some to leave the profession altogether. Rao convinced Weissman that the latest innovations in AI could dramatically reduce the amount of time doctors spend on the ever-growing paperwork burden.\n\nThis was years before generative AI took the world by storm and captured the imagination of VCs.\n\n“It was a pretty wacky idea. No one had done it before,” Weissman said.\n\nBut Weissman and other USV partners liked that Rao was a physician at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and that he spent half his time as a corporate venture capitalist for that health system, investing in health tech startups. Rao’s employees and advisers were also graduates and professors at Carnegie Mellon, one of the top institutions in the country for engineering and AI research.\n\n“[Shiv] had this rare combination of talents: an entrepreneur with a very ambitious vision, with a really interesting team,” Weissman said. “It felt unique.”\n\nAbridge also had a basic transcription product, which doctors could download for free on their smartphones and start using during their interactions with patients. Their usage formed the basis of Abridge’s LLM.\n\nA little over five years after USV led a $5 million seed round into Rao’s startup Abridge, the company has become one of the most talked about and rapidly growing AI-powered healthcare businesses.\n\nAlthough most corporations are still very cautious about adopting AI tools, large medical systems are eager to sign contracts with Abridge.\n\n“The sales cycle for [health systems] can be 18 to 24 months,” said Rao. “When we started the company, we knew what we were in for.” But with a four-year lead on a virtual scribe product trained on thousands of doctor-patient conversations, and now that AI is booming, hospitals are suddenly buying Abridge at a rapid pace, a stark contrast to their typically protracted purchasing behavior. The company has announced a new health system customer nearly every week since the start of 2024.\n\n“We had built up all this potential energy that turned kinetic almost overnight in January,” Rao said. “University of Chicago, Sutter, Yale, Lee Health, Christus, Emory and the list goes on and on,” he said.\n\nLarge hospitals are not only buying multi-thousand seat licenses of Abridge but also, in many cases, publishing glowing reviews about how the health tech’s software is changing physicians’ lives. Hospital executives and doctors are describing Abridge as “life-changing,” “magical,” and “one of the most important paradigm shifts within our careers.”\n\nOne of the biggest criticisms of generative AI is that it still has few substantive business applications. But virtual medical note taking seems to be a valuable application of the novel technology.\n\nDrowning in paperwork\n\n“I’ve got professional PTSD and war stories about seeing patients and then having to spend hours and hours at night writing notes and doing all this clerical work that really distracts from the thing that matters most, which is your patient, but also takes away from your own personal life,” Rao said.\n\nWith Abridge recording in the background, a physician can focus entirely on the patient without having to worry about filling out specific fields in the medical record during the visit.\n\nThe payback of AI-powered medical scribes is very easy to measure, says Dr. Lee Schwamm, chief digital health officer at Yale New Haven Medical System, an Abridge customer. That’s why so many health systems are flocking to use them, particularly Abridge. “It is one of the hottest products in the AI space at the moment,” he told TechCrunch.\n\nAs with many administrative things in health tech, when it comes to selecting a vendor, the most important consideration is price and integration with Epic, an electronic health records system used by most large health systems in the U.S., Schwamm said. Abridge, which supports 14 foreign languages, including Haitian Creole, Brazilian Portuguese and Punjabi, is often the winner when health systems are doing head-to-head comparisons with other AI-powered medical scribes, Schwamm said.\n\nEarlier this year, Abridge gained a right to be integrated inside Epic. After Abridge records a session and a doctor stops the recording, “there is a note in English sitting inside of Epic waiting for them to quickly verify, edit and adjust it as they see fit,” Rao said.\n\nWhile Abridge appears to be ahead of its competitors — which, besides Microsoft-owned Nuance, include Ambience Healthcare, Nabla and Suki — Schwamm is not certain it will be able to maintain its lead over the long-term.\n\n“The big question is, do you need a dedicated medical LLM to be successful in this space?” he asked. “Or will the giant foundation models, GPT-4o, Google and Meta, get so good that they could ingest an entire corpus of medical notes and start to deliver performance that’s similar?”\n\nThat line of inquiry shows that these are still early days not just for virtual medical note taking but also for most generative AI companies. The pace of innovation is fast and furious, and today’s winners could easily lose their edge.\n\n“Abridge is ahead by a length, but it’s early in the race,” Schwamm said, “A horse can get a bad knee and stumble, or it can keep getting further and further ahead.”\n\nFor now, most investors TechCrunch talked to agree that Abridge is leading the AI-powered medical scribe competition. For this reason, money has been pouring into the company.\n\nIn February, Abridge raised a $150 million Series C led by Lightspeed Ventures at a valuation of $850 million.",

This partnership is part of BIDMC’s new OpenNotes Lab, an initiative fostering collaboration between patients and clinicians in developing AI-powered tools designed to advance transparency and digital health equity.\n\nOpenNotes is leading a study to evaluate Abridge’s AI-generated patient visit summaries. The insights will be used to enhance these notes to better meet patients’ needs. In the initial phase, focus groups of patients who have been given Abridge visit summaries will evaluate them for usefulness, accessibility, and other measures of effectiveness. For this phase, there will be no use of patient data. OpenNotes specializes in co-designing research and outcomes that center on patients and doctors to improve the healthcare experience.\n\n“We are excited to lead this project that brings patients’ voices directly into the design of health AI tools,” said Catherine M. DesRoches, DrPH, Executive Director of OpenNotes at BIDMC, and Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. “By centering patients and their care partners in the process, we aim to establish new standards for responsible and transparent use of AI in clinical documentation, and ensuring these technologies serve clinicians, patients, and their care partners.”\n\nAbridge automates clinical documentation in real-time using AI, thereby reducing the burden and distraction of repetitive administrative tasks for clinicians. After each visit, Abridge creates a structured clinical note as well as a visit summary for the patient, which is written at an accessible 8th-grade reading level and provides information like new diagnoses, medications, and next steps. The collaboration with OpenNotes is aimed at enhancing the Abridge patient visit summary and setting a new standard in patient-facing documentation.\n\n“This research collaboration with OpenNotes will harness the power of actual patient conversations in informing the next generation of visit summaries, an invaluable tool in keeping doctors and patients on the same page,” said Dr. Shiv Rao, CEO and Founder of Abridge. “We are excited to continue exploring ways to enrich the Abridge platform with insights from the research we will conduct with OpenNotes.”\n\n“The visit summary came about with the widespread adoption of electronic health records in the early 2000s, and it’s overdue for a refresh,” said Katie McCurdy, Founder of Pictal Health, patient advocate, and user experience designer. McCurdy also serves on the OpenNotes Lab Advisory Board. “The potential impact of clearer, more user-friendly visit summaries is huge. OpenNotes and Abridge are the ideal teams to tackle this challenge, and patient advocates will be paying close attention.”\n\n###\n\nAbout OpenNotes\n\nOpenNotes is an international movement spreading, studying, and teaching transparent communication among patients, families, and clinicians.

One of those vendors, Pittsburgh-based Abridge, has just picked up an additional $150 million investment and a significant new customer in Yale New Haven Health System.\n\nThe new funding comes just four months after Abridge raised $30 million in a Series B investment round.\n\nAbridge said the deal with the Yale New Haven Health System, the largest and most comprehensive healthcare system in Connecticut, will give thousands of clinicians access to Abridge for clinical documentation. Yale New Haven Health has selected Abridge as their generative AI partner in this area of ambient listening. The initial deployment will be focused on reducing the cognitive burden of clinical documentation, enabling clinicians to spend more face-to-face time engaging with patients instead of computers.\n\nIn August 2023, Healthcare Innovation interviewed Alistair Erskine, M.D., M.B.A., chief information and digital officer of Atlanta-based Emory Healthcare, about why his organization signed an enterprise-wide agreement to make Abridge’s Epic-integrated solution for note-taking available to Emory clinicians over the next three years.\n\n“What I was surprised about with Abridge, and what kind of piqued my curiosity, is that its technology is across the board. I don't need to wait until it tells me ‘Okay, we're good for cardiologists now.’ Right now, I have 20 doctors using it, and it's across all different specialties and I'm getting the same positive feedback from all of them,” Erksine said. (Since that interview, Emory's Abridge user base has grown to more than 500 doctors.)\n\nAbridge said its “Linked Evidence” feature maps any highlighted region within a summary to the substantiating evidence in the source transcript (and thus to the underlying audio).

The result: an epidemic of clinician burnout. But according to research from the American Medical Association, continued healthcare provider burnout is not due to a lack of resilience among medical practitioners. Rather, it is a result of the systems that are in place at the healthcare organizations where clinicians work. Panelists will address the root cause of provider burnout and offer evidence-based solutions that can alleviate stress and depression, improve productivity, and enhance clinician wellbeing as well as patient care.

      "# [Healthcare AI startup Abridge reportedly raising $250M at $2.5B valuation by MARIA DEUTSCHER, MIKE WHEATLEY, DUNCAN RILEY on 2024-10-11](https://siliconangle.com/2024/10/11/healthcare-ai-startup-abridge-reportedly-raising-250m-2-5b-valuation/)\nAbridge AI Inc., a startup that develops artificial intelligence software for medical professionals, is reportedly raising $250 million in new funding.\n\nThe Information on Thursday cited sources as saying that technology investor Elad Gil and IVP are set to lead the investment. Alphabet Inc.’s CapitalG fund is expected to participate as well. The round will reportedly close at a pre-money valuation of $2.5 billion, a significant jump from the estimated $200 million that Abridge was worth last year.\n\nPhysicians spend a significant portion of their working days writing medical notes. Moreover, they have to upload every note manually to their hospital’s EHR system, a type of application used to manage electronic health records. Pittsburgh-based Abridge offers an AI platform that promises to automate most of the task.\n\nThe company’s platform is accessible through mobile app that physicians activate before every doctor’s appointment. The software records the conversation, transcribes it and then uses the transcript to automatically generate medical notes.\n\nThat doesn’t fully automate the note-taking process. After creating a draft, physicians must check it for accuracy and make edits as necessary. A feature called Linked Evidence links each AI-generated sentence in a medical note to the transcript excerpt from which it was generated, which makes it easier to spot errors.\n\nThe platform is integrated into Epic, the most widely used application for managing electronic health records. Physicians can edit AI-generated medical notes in Epic’s mobile client without juggling multiple tabs, which speeds up the workflow.\n\nAbridge promises to automate up to 91% of the work involved in creating medical notes. According to the company, that translates to 70 hours of saved time per clinician per month. The result is that medical professionals can dedicate a larger portion of their work days to delivering patient care, as well as create more detailed notes than they would otherwise have time for.\n\nThe Abridge platform is powered by internally developed AI models. The company says that its algorithms understand over 14 languages and clinical terms across more than 50 medical specialties. Moreover, it claims that its technology significantly outperforms other AI models optimized for healthcare tasks.\n\nThis week’s report that Abridge is seeking fresh funding comes about eight months after the company closed its most recent $150 million round. At the time, it stated that a portion of the capital will go towards developing new AI models. The company was planning to use those models both to enhance its existing medical note platform and power new, yet-unannounced products.\n\nAn additional $250 million on the books would make it easier for Abridge to shoulder the significant costs associated with building custom AI models. The investment would als put the company in a better position to address the growing competition it’s facing from fellow AI startups. Suki AI Inc., which provides a rival tool for generating medical notes, raised $70 million in funding earlier earlier this week.\n\nImage: Abridge"
