Authorize, permit, enable, induce or encourage any third party to do any of the above.\n\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH US AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU MAY SEEK RELIEF FROM US.‍\n\n(a) Generally. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law and in the interest of resolving disputes between You and Abridge in the most expedient and cost effective manner, You and Abridge agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration, unless You are located in a jurisdiction that prohibits the exclusive use of arbitration for dispute resolution.\n\nArbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this Agreement. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND Abridge ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. ‍\n\n(b) Opt-Out of Agreement to Arbitrate. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by contacting legal@abridge.com within 30 days of first accepting this Agreement and stating that you (include your first and last name, and email address used to register for the Abridge Platform) decline this arbitration agreement.‍\n\n(c) Exceptions. Despite the provisions of Section 15(a), nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either Party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.‍\n\n(d) Arbitrator. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any arbitration between You and Abridge will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Abridge.‍\n\n(e) Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice”). Abridge’s address for Notice is: Abridge AI, Inc., 500 Grant Street, Suite 2900, Pittsburgh, PA 15219. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The Parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the Parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, You or Abridge may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by You or Abridge must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in Your favor, Abridge will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Abridge in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.‍\n\n(f) Fees. If You commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Abridge will reimburse You for Your payment of the filing fee, unless Your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location, to be agreed upon, in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, You may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of Your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, You agree to reimburse Abridge for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.‍\n\n(g) No Class Actions. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND Abridge AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both You and Abridge agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, to the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law.‍\n\n(h) Claims. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, no action arising out of, in connection with, or relating to this Agreement shall be brought by You more than one (1) year after the accrual of the cause of action. This period shall not be extended for any reason, except by the written consent of both parties. All statutes or provisions of law which would toll or otherwise affect the running of the period of limitation are hereby waived, and no such statute or provision of law shall operate to extend the period limited in this paragraph, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.\n\n(a) Governing Law; Venue. To the fullest extent permitted pursuant to applicable law, these Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Pennsylvania without regard to conflict of law principles. If a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under this Agreement, then You and Abridge agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for the purpose of litigating any dispute.\n\n(b) International Users. We operate the Platform from locations within the United States. The Platform is intended for Users located within the United States. We make no representation that the Platform or Abridge Technology is appropriate or available for use outside of the United States. Access to the Platform from countries or territories or by individuals where such access is illegal is strictly prohibited.\n\n(c) Independent Contractors. The Parties are independent contractors. This Agreement does not establish any relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency between You, Abridge, and neither Party nor any third party will have the power to act on the other Party’s behalf without the other Party’s prior written consent.‍\n\n(d) Assignment. No Party shall have the right to assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, or any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the other Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), except that Abridge may assign this Agreement without consent as part of a corporate reorganization, reorganization, or upon a change of control, consolidation, merger, or transfer of all or substantially all of its business related to this Agreement, whether by sale of stock or assets, operation of law, or otherwise. Any attempted assignment or delegation in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.‍\n\n(e) Force Majeure. Except for the obligation to pay money, no Party will be liable for any failure or delay in its performance under this Agreement due to any cause beyond its reasonable control, including acts of war, acts of God, labor shortages or disputes, pandemics, governmental acts or failure or degradation of the Internet or telecommunications services. The delayed Party will give the other Party prompt notice of such cause, and will make commercially reasonable efforts to promptly correct such failure or delay in performance.\n\n(f) Severability; Waiver; Entire Agreement. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision shall be modified so as best to accomplish the original intent of the Parties to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in effect. The waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior understandings and agreements.‍\n\n(g) Promotion. Abridge may include Your name and logo in lists of Abridge’s customers, solely to identify You as a user of the Platform and further provided that such customer lists shall not be presented in such a way as to indicate or imply any endorsement by or affiliation with You unless Abridge obtains Your prior written consent.‍\n\n(h) Notices. Except as otherwise set forth herein, all notices under these Terms will be by email or provided by Us by way of the Platform. All notices to Us should be sent to legal@abridge.com. Notices will be deemed to have been duly given the same day in the case of notices provided by us by way of email or the Services.\n\n(i) No Third Party Beneficiary. No person other than the Parties hereto will be entitled to any of the benefits of these Terms or be deemed to acquire any rights hereunder.\n\n(j) Export Compliance. The Abridge Technology may be subject to export laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions. You represent that You are not named on any U.S. government denied-party list. You shall not use the Abridge Technology in violation of any U.S. export law or regulation.",

      "# Post ID 1deibuu: AI scribing so far—what works and what's missing? with +26 score by [(markatdaily, Reddit, 2024-06-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/)\nFull disclosure: I am a software product lead working on solutions tailored for healthcare providers. My primary goal is to offload administrative tasks and streamline workflows to give providers more time to focus on patient care and ultimately improve health outcomes.\n\nWith the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI scribing has gained significant traction. Numerous products are now available to assist with clinical documentation. For those who have integrated these tools into their practice, I’d love to hear your experiences:\n\n1. **Reliability**: Have the AI scribing tools proven reliable enough for you to trust them in your daily practice?\n2. **Missing Features**: What key features do you feel are lacking in the current offerings?\n3. **Integration**: Many providers emphasize the importance of EHR integration. How effectively have these integrations saved you time and streamlined your workflow?\n4. **Impact on Patient Care**: Have you observed any changes, whether positive or negative, in patient care or your interactions with patients since adopting AI scribing tools?\n5. **Training and Support**: How would you rate the training and support provided for these tools? Are there any additional resources or improvements that you believe would be helpful?\n\nI am here not to promote a specific product, but rather to learn about what works well and what falls short. I hope this discussion will also benefit others who are developing software tools for healthcare providers. Your insights will be invaluable in helping us create solutions that genuinely support the needs of healthcare professionals.\n\nThank you in advance for your feedback and insights!\n\n## Comment ID l8cg6pn with +48 score by [(grey-doc, Reddit, 2024-06-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8cg6pn/) (in reply to ID 1deibuu):\nDeepscribe - just not a great product and horribly overpriced.  Human transcriber reviews notes, it takes quite a while for the notes to come back.  Human editors are quite apparent in the note quality.  \n\nFreed - a real AI service.  Quick and efficient.  Almost no features, but it doesn't need much.  Often includes what I saw as if the patient says it, not great.\n\nHeidi - almost perfect.  Like actually almost perfect, out of the box.  The phrasing in notes is terse and \"medical\" without excessive verbosity.  The generation is A+ with great settings on variability.  Hallucination rate is low, context understanding is unsettlingly high.  Only caveat is the website is a little heavy, can be a touch slow on a tablet or phone.\n\nWhat's missing...not much.  Heidi gets it good.  Integration in EMR maybe, but copy and paste works great.  I would have a hard time doing better than Heidi and I say this as a software engineer with very high standards.\n\nNote that all notes require careful review.  These models do occasionally misinterpret and hallucinate.  Of note, if Heidi gets it wrong, you can easily regenerate the note and it will often do a better job, which is nice.\n\nThe hallucination in Heidi is really interesting.  Sometimes it will hallucinate something into the A&P that we didn't talk about which is clinically relevant and we SHOULD have talked about.  A couple times I've called the patient in the evening to talk about it, even.  Go figure. Wouldn't have expected it to be a clinical decision informer but sometimes it is.  Frankly I kinda enjoy going through the notes, it's an interesting second opinion and review of the visit.\n\nI don't mean to rain on your parade but this is the truth.\n\nThe next untouched AI tool is something to query the medical record, \"has patient X ever been tested for hepatitis\" or \"has anyone tried to find out why their alkaline phosphatase is high.\" Or using AI to navigate MIPS and insurance prior auths.\n\n### Comment ID l8cmrab with +15 score by [(DrMo-UC, Reddit, 2024-06-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8cmrab/) (in reply to ID l8cg6pn):\n>The next untouched AI tool is something to query the medical record, \"has patient X ever been tested for hepatitis\" or \"has anyone tried to find out why their alkaline phosphatase is high.\"\n\nIt's the only AI tool I need for which actually doesn't even have to be AI.\n\n#### Comment ID l8ff9vl with +3 score by [(MarcoGalletti, Reddit, 2024-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8ff9vl/) (in reply to ID l8cmrab):\nHi OP, I would not say that it is untouched.

The integration is a huge time saver. Not having to copy/paste saves a lot of time. Overall, the AI quality is good, and I like the AVS that it generates as a patient-level recap of the visit. The only issue has been needing to recap the visit at the end for a more accurate A&P. I like to do it in the room, but often, the patient constantly interrupts with comments that may or may not be related. It has captured some diagnoses or topics for the plan. I remember we talked about them in the room but forgot to write them down, so that has been good. There are rare hallucinations in the notes. More it is that the AI includes small topics that the patient mentioned, but I don't feel they are worth having in the notes.\n\n  \nThe biggest AI need, however, is software to OCR the digital PDF archives, combine them with the CareEverywhere documentation and clinic documentation, and create a nice patient overview.\n\n### Comment ID l8eybd2 with +2 score by [(markatdaily, Reddit, 2024-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8eybd2/) (in reply to ID l8diu3i):\n> The only issue has been needing to recap the visit at the end for a more accurate A&P.

They perform the same way every single time. Crash some but not horrible. The problem is, consistently mediocre is still mediocre. They do reliable listen and transcribe - I cannot say much bad about this. They are accurate in simply getting conversation into the program. \n\nOne major problem for me is syntax. The end result is written in a way that I don’t find attractive or natural. Feels more bulky. Too wordy. “The patient” over and over. Tries to use big words that are never used in an HPI. Just seems forced. Although information is correct, it comes across in a way I don’t like and I’m too anal to leave it. Sometimes wont filter out information. Throws an entire paragraph about the patients ski trip last year that is irrelevant to current complaint of gout. \n\nIntegration is key. Proof and edit is going to be needed. But if it takes multiple steps or another program to access the AI generated information, then it’s not saving you as much time as it promises. Just more clicks to copy paste and so forth. In my opinion any program that doesn’t integrate directly into your note is useless in my opinion. \n\nKeying up orders would be helpful but take some work. Would never be perfect. I would like more ability to edit the product to be something closer to how I prefer to write. \n\nImpact on patient care? So far for me…more eye contact. That’s about it. \n\nTraining should be focused on teaching users what words and phrases to use to help the program out. To help get the right information into the exam vs the assessment and plan. To get the right diagnoses etc. The goal should be less editing. The result should be 90% done. But it’s nowhere close for me personally. \n\nThese have potential, but we are a long ways away from where they’ll have to be to be used widely across specialties, doc, systems, etc. \n\nFor the record, my experience is with DAX.\n\n### Comment ID l8cf8jc with +8 score by [(grey-doc, Reddit, 2024-06-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8cf8jc/) (in reply to ID l8cbx7u):\nTry Heidi with the \"brief\" or \"Goldilocks\" verbosity setting.

Overall, it is successful in creating what I need about 95% of the time. It certainly shortens the time I spend writing notes. \n\nHowever, a 5% error rate is still 1 in 20, and I have to review the notes very carefully before finalizing them. \n\nSo far what has not yet been successful is creating an organized task list for the patient in myself for future follow-up. \n\nAnother interesting aspect of my practice, being cash only, is that I have no particular billing or coding requirements, and the structure of my notes has changed dramatically from the soap note that I was taught in residency. My visits are also an hour or more in length, and cover topics ranging from emotional processing to relationships to lab results to longevity studies. \n\nI'm very curious about how a commercial product like Heidi would perform with my very \"non medical\" conversational topics with patients.\n\nSo far the prompt I have crafted and tweaked is doing well at creating a note that I find useful and serviceable. \n\nThe biggest issue is when it misses something that I know I talked about with the patient, and I have to search the transcript to find it.\n\n### Comment ID l8ere5m with +2 score by [(Harvard_Med_USMLE265, Reddit, 2024-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8ere5m/) (in reply to ID l8dpgum):\nWould you be willing to share your prompt?

It gives you a gender neutral HPI (i.e. uses \"they/them\" pronouns) as well as mental status exam (I'm in psychiatry) and plan.  The MSE and plan are useless, at least for me. The HPI is decent.\n\nFreed doesn't show you a transcription live but you can access it afterwards. It gives a better HPI than Nabla and you can choose gender so it sounds better than using \"they/them\" all over. It also does a more honest job at the MSE; basically never attempts to write one and says \"not enough objective data.\" It also gives a plan and after visit summary. Both are really solid. Anything you say during the appointment in terms of plan, it'll capture. If I mention diet and exercise, it'll put in specifically what I said rather than just say \"lifestyle changes\". I have a template for plan that I prefer using so I don't actually use that part but I could easily see someone finding it useful (unlike Nabla where I don't think most people would find the generated plan sufficient). The after visit summary is gold though. Writes instructions as a letter from you to the patient, with an easy to read list of what was talked about during the appointment. \n\nIf they cut the price in half, I'd recommend Freed without any doubt. I wouldn't say it's worth a $100 a month though, especially since Nabla is free and the HPI is the main thing you want from an AI anyway, not plan or AVS.\n\n#### Comment ID k20c8mu with +11 score by [(blade24, Reddit, 2023-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k20c8mu/) (in reply to ID k1y3r77):\nWhat are the legal ramifications of these?

I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers. Full HIPAA compliance and patient information is protected.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more! You can also shoot me an email ernest.chan@getathelas.com and I'd be happy to chat more.\n\n## Comment ID k23jy34 with +1 score by [(toastycitrus, Reddit, 2023-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k23jy34/) (in reply to ID 16qm7ji):\nEdit\n\n### Comment ID ki1hlaw with +1 score by [(Emotional_Walrus_782, Reddit, 2024-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/ki1hlaw/) (in reply to ID k23jy34):\nCan actually do this with Heidi.

I’ve been using Suki. It has direct access to my EMR and schedule so it’s as simple as clicking the patients name and starting the “note”. I access it through my phone and leave the phone near the patient and myself. It then processes the ramblings (I can be all over the place sometimes) of the visit and manages to organize it into HPI and a/p VERY accurately and in better detail than what I would normally do without it. It also does physical exam and other things like patient instructions but you’d need to speak out the physical exam which is weird. It has been life changing because it takes away the mental burden of documenting after seeing patients. I often do all my notes at lunch and then after the afternoon session because it allows me to stay on time and focus on the patient. Knowing all the details are being captured and all I need to do is organize the note a little is FANTASTIC. It requires so much less brain power than formulating the note and truly does it so well.\n\nCurrently offered by my practice but it’s 400 a month which is pricey.

If I do 30 notes, it will give me 30 different styles. Some have dash bullet point, some list problems as 1,2,3, some notes will have them as a,b,c, others are just in paragraph form. It has a personalization feature where you are supposed to be able to teach it a certain style, but it doesn’t work. I desperately need help with notes and want this to work so bad, but it hasn’t been what I was hoping it would be.",
      "# Post ID 1b0befu: Best AI medical scribe tools? Do people use them? with +84 score by [(guiltless_inaccuracy, Reddit, 2024-02-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/)\nPhysician in a small clinic here. My practice has been looking into these new AI medical scribes to help with our clinical documentation. Everyone’s pretty burned out from spending so much time on patient notes, so this seems like a really interesting solution. Are these tools safe & legit?\n\nI wanted to try DeepScribe and DAX but it seems like you have to go through sales. A friend recommended NoteMD and I’ve been trying it out for a few days. So far it’s pretty good (it doesn’t save patient recordings which is great), but sometimes it doesn’t capture a sentence or two.\n\nWhat do people think about using these? Are they safe?\n\nEDIT: Thanks all for your comments, please stop spamming me in DMs :-) Our practice ended up with NoteMD which is working great.\n\n## Comment ID ks7b78p with +32 score by [(DrTestificate_MD, Reddit, 2024-02-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7b78p/) (in reply to ID 1b0befu):\nYes some people are using them.

Captures most of what is said and knows where to put it (History, exam, A/P, PI etc). Produces paragraphs of prose.

Takes me 2 min to write my own primary care notes (after a little pre-charting.) When an AI model can read my previous notes and learn how I document and reproduce my style then I’ll use it.

Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nFeel free to reach out to me via my booking link to learn more!

Sharing audio between softwares is tricky from an eng POV but it is something on our roadmap, we just want to make sure it's 🤌 before a major rollout.\n\nLet us know how you go, you'll get Heidi Pro as a free trial upon signup so play around with it as much as you like.\n\n#### Comment ID kue872b with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/kue872b/) (in reply to ID kuajtlo):\nMax friendly?

They have a live scribe on with you all day to do your orders, coding, mapping diagnosis, etch and then the AI listens to your conversation that you have with the patient to capture the visit and then produces the note.  The live scribe imports the note to the chart.  It works great and the providers love it.  The scribes are off shore so the cost is low.  The AI note outputs are quite impressive and having a real person help the doctors made adoption very easy. Hope this helps.\n\n### Comment ID l6lflvl with +1 score by [(Jackyl_and_High, Reddit, 2024-06-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/l6lflvl/) (in reply to ID l121jyh):\nCost ?\n\n#### Comment ID lc95bao with +1 score by [(DCK1D, Reddit, 2024-07-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/lc95bao/) (in reply to ID l6lflvl):\nI can get you setup at [getwava.com](http://getwava.com) for free if you are interested. all I ask is for your feedback on the software so that I can improve it.\n\n### Comment ID l6o7c3v with +1 score by [(jrs9099, Reddit, 2024-06-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/l6o7c3v/) (in reply to ID l121jyh):\n~$2500 per fte per month.\n\n## Comment ID l4n9miw with +1 score by [(elietoubi, Reddit, 2024-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/l4n9miw/) (in reply to ID 1b0befu):\nHey,  \nA ton of people reached out to me on the reddit thread.\n\nI am the CEO of [scribeMD.ai](http://scribeMD.ai) ...

It's such a relief to walk out of a clinic visit and have the note already written for you. It lets me spend more time with patients rather than trying to budget time for charting and helps me leave the office at a reasonable time. I also get to spend more time with patients face to face rather than trying to enter things into the computer so that I don't forget later. I can see three patients in a row and it keeps track of everything I covered in each visit with more precision than my memory. The notes are detailed and comprehensive. It's not perfect.

The AI part of it then takes that transcription and writes a SOAP note summarizing the conversation. It's really good at filtering out the small talk vs the clinically important things for the HPI part, and knows to list the diagnosis with the relevant associated counseling and prescriptions in the assessment and plans part. It has a concise vs comprehensive mode for how succinct you want your notes to be. I use concise and it's still plenty detailed though. You can view the raw  transcription of the conversation if you feel its interpretation of some point wasn't quite right and you want to double check what was actually said. My editing is usually to shorten the note even further because it incorporated pieces of history that weren't relevant to the current complaint. It's honestly a better note than what a lot of doctors write themselves, especially if you're the type of doctor who usually writes three sentence notes that are filled with abbreviations everywhere.\n\n### Comment ID lu8shgc with +1 score by [(Drkindlycountryquack, Reddit, 2024-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/1gcwj1i/anyone_using_ai_charting/lu8shgc/) (in reply to ID ltxjrvt):\nPlus you can hit print and give the patient a copy of the visit notes so they know what to do.\n\n## Comment ID ltx74wl with +19 score by [(AnKingMed, Reddit, 2024-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/1gcwj1i/anyone_using_ai_charting/ltx74wl/) (in reply to ID 1gcwj1i):\nThey’re pretty sweet!

There’s a list of patients there where you just hit the copy button and ctrl V directly in your EMR of choice. You make and edit charts using your phone app, the AI can be used as dictation or can ambiently listen to the conversation and have the portions of the chart completed when you get back to your desk. You can talk to the ai to amend to chart itself if you find anything you don’t like instead of having to type corrections or to add additional information.

Just the exhaustion in my eyes causes burnout and without having to stare at a computer all day - along with the emotional energy it takes, made the job really tough.”\n* ‘It’s one of the first times ever when a patient tells you a breakthrough or pivotal information where the knee jerk reaction isn’t to immediately look at the computer and document that. Everything is so much more fresh and the notes are much more specific in regard to each session which really allows for the authenticity of what’s happening in the sessions to be captured.’\n\nWhether from a clinical or business perspective, the goal is to make documentation more efficient so that you can see more patients and increase top line revenue.\n\n[**Schedule some time or reach out at ernest.chan@getathelas.com**](https://hello.athelas.com/c/ernest_chan#/select-time)\n\n*-* [*Athelas Scribe Testimonial Video*](https://hello.athelas.com/api/mailings/click/PMRGSZBCHIZTSNRRGQZSYITVOJWCEORCNB2HI4DTHIXS65TJNVSW6LTDN5WS6OBYG4YDGMJWHEYSELBCN5ZGOIR2EIZWKZTCGYYTIMZNGFSDCOJNGRRTKMJNMIYGKNBNMY4WCZBZHA2DOMTCMJSCELBCOZSXE43JN5XCEORCGQRCYITTNFTSEORCIMWVQVDLI54TC4DGIVMUIMLUHFCXUVCYNZEEKRBZMRVTE4RQJZJEGUKSOREEE22PLA2GOPJCPU======)\n\n*-* [*Athelas Scribe Demo*](https://hello.athelas.com/api/mailings/click/PMRGSZBCHIZTSNRRGQZSYITVOJWCEORCNB2HI4DTHIXS65TJNVSW6LTDN5WS6OJUGIYTIMBVGQ4SELBCN5ZGOIR2EIZWKZTCGYYTIMZNGFSDCOJNGRRTKMJNMIYGKNBNMY4WCZBZHA2DOMTCMJSCELBCOZSXE43JN5XCEORCGQRCYITTNFTSEORCKBXVATTIK5DGORCZK54HSYKLMRQVC5K7JVLXS4JWIMZUGRKKGRHUKQ2DPJZWEWKYJZTGOPJCPU======)\n\n*-* [*Athelas EHR Integration with Scribe*](https://hello.athelas.com/api/mailings/click/PMRGSZBCHIZTSNRRGQZSYITVOJWCEORCNB2HI4DTHIXS65TJNVSW6LTDN5WS6OJUGIYTINRVGUYSELBCN5ZGOIR2EIZWKZTCGYYTIMZNGFSDCOJNGRRTKMJNMIYGKNBNMY4WCZBZHA2DOMTCMJSCELBCOZSXE43JN5XCEORCGQRCYITTNFTSEORCMRCXIMZXGNYWUZCNKBRGKQ2WGJLFGVKUJBJUKMDQIVYXEZBSIZKXIUDKMR4S2WTROZ2EKPJCPU======)\n\n*-* [*Athelas Intake Features Demo*](https://hello.athelas.com/api/mailings/click/PMRGSZBCHIZTSNRRGQZSYITVOJWCEORCNB2HI4DTHIXS653XO4XGY33PNUXGG33NF5ZWQYLSMUXTQNTBMMYTOMDGGUYWENBUGIYDQOBXHAYTAMZZGNSTGNLDGVRGKNJ7ONUWIPJRGVQWEYJVMQZS2NBYGRSS2NBWG44S2YRYMM3S2OBXGA3TONRZMY4DSZBVEIWCE33SM4RDUIRTMVTGENRRGQZS2MLEGE4S2NDDGUYS2YRQMU2C2ZRZMFSDSOBUG4ZGEYTEEIWCE5TFOJZWS33OEI5CENBCFQRHG2LHEI5CEU2VGRJW6QRYIJAUCQJRJYZHMRDYNRRWE6SFIM4DIYJWJ5WWUQLTONQTEWKZFUWVIMK7JU6SE7I=)\n\n*-* [*Customized Formatting Demo*](https://hello.athelas.com/api/mailings/click/PMRGSZBCHIZTSNRRGQZSYITVOJWCEORCNB2HI4DTHIXS653XO4XGY33PNUXGG33NF5ZWQYLSMUXTKMBWGIZDKMJZMQ2TINJUMNRDEYTFGAZDEOJYGU2DAMZTGQ4WKNZCFQRG64THEI5CEM3FMZRDMMJUGMWTCZBRHEWTIYZVGEWWEMDFGQWWMOLBMQ4TQNBXGJRGEZBCFQRHMZLSONUW63RCHIRDIIRMEJZWSZZCHIRHCURQIRXWE2TGGZFVQY2PNZWUS4DGN5HUWRKTKNDXCNLJGRHUESBVKNEEGULQJBKWQUKFHURH2===)\n\n## Comment ID lle8lz6 with +1 score by [(Altruistic-Piece-843, Reddit, 2024-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/emergencymedicine/comments/1d8gz7a/ai_scribes_anyone_as_far_as_i_can_tell_the_last/lle8lz6/) (in reply to ID 1d8gz7a):\nHello there!

      "# Post ID 17rrd6h: AI is about to completely change how you use computers with +977 score by [(thisisbillgates, Reddit, 2023-11-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/)\nI still love software as much today as I did when Paul Allen and I started Microsoft. But—even though it has improved a lot in the decades since then—in many ways, software is still pretty dumb.\r  \n\r  \nTo do any task on a computer, you have to tell your device which app to use. You can use Microsoft Word and Google Docs to draft a business proposal, but they can’t help you send an email, share a selfie, analyze data, schedule a party, or buy movie tickets. And even the best sites have an incomplete understanding of your work, personal life, interests, and relationships and a limited ability to use this information to do things for you. That’s the kind of thing that is only possible today with another human being, like a close friend or personal assistant.\r  \n\r  \nIn the next five years, this will change completely. You won’t have to use different apps for different tasks. You’ll simply tell your device, in everyday language, what you want to do. And depending on how much information you choose to share with it, the software will be able to respond personally because it will have a rich understanding of your life. In the near future, anyone who’s online will be able to have a personal assistant powered by artificial intelligence that’s far beyond today’s technology.\r  \n\r  \nThis type of software—something that responds to natural language and can accomplish many different tasks based on its knowledge of the user—is called an agent. I’ve been thinking about agents for nearly 30 years and wrote about them in my 1995 book The Road Ahead, but they’ve only recently become practical because of advances in AI.\r  \n\r  \nAgents are not only going to change how everyone interacts with computers. They’re also going to upend the software industry, bringing about the biggest revolution in computing since we went from typing commands to tapping on icons.\r  \n\r  \n**A personal assistant for everyone**\n\nSome critics have pointed out that software companies have offered this kind of thing before, and users didn’t exactly embrace them. (People still joke about Clippy, the digital assistant that we included in Microsoft Office and later dropped.) Why will people use agents?\r  \n\r  \nThe answer is that they’ll be dramatically better. You’ll be able to have nuanced conversations with them. They will be much more personalized, and they won’t be limited to relatively simple tasks like writing a letter. Clippy has as much in common with agents as a rotary phone has with a mobile device.\r  \n\r  \nAn agent will be able to help you with all your activities if you want it to. With permission to follow your online interactions and real-world locations, it will develop a powerful understanding of the people, places, and activities you engage in. It will get your personal and work relationships, hobbies, preferences, and schedule. You’ll choose how and when it steps in to help with something or ask you to make a decision.\r  \n\n\n>\"Clippy was a bot, not an agent.\"\n\n\r  \nTo see the dramatic change that agents will bring, let’s compare them to the AI tools available today. Most of these are bots. They’re limited to one app and generally only step in when you write a particular word or ask for help. Because they don’t remember how you use them from one time to the next, they don’t get better or learn any of your preferences. Clippy was a bot, not an agent.\r  \n\r  \nAgents are smarter. They’re proactive—capable of making suggestions before you ask for them. They accomplish tasks across applications. They improve over time because they remember your activities and recognize intent and patterns in your behavior. Based on this information, they offer to provide what they think you need, although you will always make the final decisions.\r  \n\r  \nImagine that you want to plan a trip. A travel bot will identify hotels that fit your budget. An agent will know what time of year you’ll be traveling and, based on its knowledge about whether you always try a new destination or like to return to the same place repeatedly, it will be able to suggest locations. When asked, it will recommend things to do based on your interests and propensity for adventure, and it will book reservations at the types of restaurants you would enjoy. If you want this kind of deeply personalized planning today, you need to pay a travel agent and spend time telling them what you want.\r  \n\r  \nThe most exciting impact of AI agents is the way they will democratize services that today are too expensive for most people. They’ll have an especially big influence in four areas: health care, education, productivity, and entertainment and shopping.\r  \n\r  \n**Health care**\n\nToday, AI’s main role in healthcare is to help with administrative tasks. Abridge, Nuance DAX, and Nabla Copilot, for example, can capture audio during an appointment and then write up notes for the doctor to review.\r  \n\r  \nThe real shift will come when agents can help patients do basic triage, get advice about how to deal with health problems, and decide whether they need to seek treatment. These agents will also help healthcare workers make decisions and be more productive. (Already, apps like Glass Health can analyze a patient summary and suggest diagnoses for the doctor to consider.) Helping patients and healthcare workers will be especially beneficial for people in poor countries, where many never get to see a doctor at all.\r  \n\r  \nThese clinician-agents will be slower than others to roll out because getting things right is a matter of life and death. People will need to see evidence that health agents are beneficial overall, even though they won’t be perfect and will make mistakes. Of course, humans make mistakes too, and having no access to medical care is also a problem.\r  \n\n\n>\"Half of all U.S. military veterans who need mental health care don’t get it.\"\n\n\r  \nMental health care is another example of a service that agents will make available to virtually everyone. Today, weekly therapy sessions seem like a luxury. But there is a lot of unmet need, and many people who could benefit from therapy don’t have access to it. For example, RAND found that half of all U.S. military veterans who need mental health care don’t get it.\r  \n\r  \nAI agents that are well trained in mental health will make therapy much more affordable and easier to get. Wysa and Youper are two of the early chatbots here. But agents will go much deeper. If you choose to share enough information with a mental health agent, it will understand your life history and your relationships. It’ll be available when you need it, and it will never get impatient. It could even, with your permission, monitor your physical responses to therapy through your smart watch—like if your heart starts to race when you’re talking about a problem with your boss—and suggest when you should see a human therapist.\r  \n\r  \n**Education**\n\nFor decades, I’ve been excited about all the ways that software would make teachers’ jobs easier and help students learn. It won’t replace teachers, but it will supplement their work—personalizing the work for students and liberating teachers from paperwork and other tasks so they can spend more time on the most important parts of the job. These changes are finally starting to happen in a dramatic way.\r  \n\r  \nThe current state of the art is Khanmigo, a text-based bot created by Khan Academy. It can tutor students in math, science, and the humanities—for example, it can explain the quadratic formula and create math problems to practice on. It can also help teachers do things like write lesson plans. I’ve been a fan and supporter of Sal Khan’s work for a long time and recently had him on my podcast to talk about education and AI.\r  \n\r  \nBut text-based bots are just the first wave—agents will open up many more learning opportunities.\r  \n\r  \nFor example, few families can pay for a tutor who works one-on-one with a student to supplement their classroom work. If agents can capture what makes a tutor effective, they’ll unlock this supplemental instruction for everyone who wants it. If a tutoring agent knows that a kid likes Minecraft and Taylor Swift, it will use Minecraft to teach them about calculating the volume and area of shapes, and Taylor’s lyrics to teach them about storytelling and rhyme schemes. The experience will be far richer—with graphics and sound, for example—and more personalized than today’s text-based tutors.\r  \n\r  \n**Productivity**\n\nThere’s already a lot of competition in this field. Microsoft is making its Copilot part of Word, Excel, Outlook, and other services. Google is doing similar things with Assistant with Bard and its productivity tools. These copilots can do a lot—such as turn a written document into a slide deck, answer questions about a spreadsheet using natural language, and summarize email threads while representing each person’s point of view.\r  \n\r  \nAgents will do even more. Having one will be like having a person dedicated to helping you with various tasks and doing them independently if you want. If you have an idea for a business, an agent will help you write up a business plan, create a presentation for it, and even generate images of what your product might look like. Companies will be able to make agents available for their employees to consult directly and be part of every meeting so they can answer questions.\r  \n\n\n>\"If your friend just had surgery, your agent will offer to send flowers and be able to order them for you.\"\n\n  \nWhether you work in an office or not, your agent will be able to help you in the same way that personal assistants support executives today. If your friend just had surgery, your agent will offer to send flowers and be able to order them for you. If you tell it you’d like to catch up with your old college roommate, it will work with their agent to find a time to get together, and just before you arrive, it will remind you that their oldest child just started college at the local university.\r  \n\r  \n**Entertainment and shopping**\n\nAlready, AI can help you pick out a new TV and recommend movies, books, shows, and podcasts. Likewise, a company I’ve invested in, recently launched Pix, which lets you ask questions (“Which Robert Redford movies would I like and where can I watch them?”) and then makes recommendations based on what you’ve liked in the past. Spotify has an AI-powered DJ that not only plays songs based on your preferences but talks to you and can even call you by name.\r  \n\r  \nAgents won’t simply make recommendations; they’ll help you act on them. If you want to buy a camera, you’ll have your agent read all the reviews for you, summarize them, make a recommendation, and place an order for it once you’ve made a decision. If you tell your agent that you want to watch Star Wars, it will know whether you’re subscribed to the right streaming service, and if you aren’t, it will offer to sign you up. And if you don’t know what you’re in the mood for, it will make customized suggestions and then figure out how to play the movie or show you choose.\r  \n\r  \nYou’ll also be able to get news and entertainment that’s been tailored to your interests. CurioAI, which creates a custom podcast on any subject you ask about, is a glimpse of what’s coming.\r  \n\r  \n**A shock wave in the tech industry**\n\nIn short, agents will be able to help with virtually any activity and any area of life. The ramifications for the software business and for society will be profound.\r  \n\r  \nIn the computing industry, we talk about platforms—the technologies that apps and services are built on. Android, iOS, and Windows are all platforms. Agents will be the next platform.\r\r  \n\n\n>\"To create a new app or service, you'll just tell your agent what you want.\"\n\n\r  \nTo create a new app or service, you won’t need to know how to write code or do graphic design. You’ll just tell your agent what you want. It will be able to write the code, design the look and feel of the app, create a logo, and publish the app to an online store. OpenAI’s launch of GPTs this week offers a glimpse into the future where non-developers can easily create and share their own assistants.\r  \n\r  \nAgents will affect how we use software as well as how it’s written. They’ll replace search sites because they’ll be better at finding information and summarizing it for you. They’ll replace many e-commerce sites because they’ll find the best price for you and won’t be restricted to just a few vendors. They’ll replace word processors, spreadsheets, and other productivity apps. Businesses that are separate today—search advertising, social networking with advertising, shopping, productivity software—will become one business.\r  \n\r  \nI don’t think any single company will dominate the agents business--there will be many different AI engines available. Today, agents are embedded in other software like word processors and spreadsheets, but eventually they’ll operate on their own. Although some agents will be free to use (and supported by ads), I think you’ll pay for most of them, which means companies will have an incentive to make agents work on your behalf and not an advertiser’s. If the number of companies that have started working on AI just this year is any indication, there will be an exceptional amount of competition, which will make agents very inexpensive.\r  \n\r  \nBut before the sophisticated agents I’m describing become a reality, we need to confront a number of questions about the technology and how we’ll use it. I’ve written before about the issues that AI raises, so I’ll focus specifically on agents here.\r  \n\r  \n**The technical challenges**\n\nNobody has figured out yet what the data structure for an agent will look like. To create personal agents, we need a new type of database that can capture all the nuances of your interests and relationships and quickly recall the information while maintaining your privacy. We are already seeing new ways of storing information, such as vector databases, that may be better for storing data generated by machine learning models.\r  \n\r  \nAnother open question is about how many agents people will interact with. Will your personal agent be separate from your therapist agent and your math tutor? If so, when will you want them to work with each other and when should they stay in their lanes?\r  \n\n\n>“If your agent needs to check in with you, it will speak to you or show up on your phone.”\n\n  \nHow will you interact with your agent? Companies are exploring various options including apps, glasses, pendants, pins, and even holograms. All of these are possibilities, but I think the first big breakthrough in human-agent interaction will be earbuds. If your agent needs to check in with you, it will speak to you or show up on your phone. (“Your flight is delayed. Do you want to wait, or can I help rebook it?”) If you want, it will monitor sound coming into your ear and enhance it by blocking out background noise, amplifying speech that’s hard to hear, or making it easier to understand someone who’s speaking with a heavy accent.\r  \n\r  \nThere are other challenges too. There isn’t yet a standard protocol that will allow agents to talk to each other. The cost needs to come down so agents are affordable for everyone. It needs to be easier to prompt the agent in a way that will give you the right answer. We need to prevent hallucinations, especially in areas like health where accuracy is super-important, and make sure that agents don’t harm people as a result of their biases. And we don’t want agents to be able to do things they’re not supposed to. (Although I worry less about rogue agents than about human criminals using agents for malign purposes.)\r  \n\r  \n**Privacy and other big questions**\n\nAs all of this comes together, the issues of online privacy and security will become even more urgent than they already are. You’ll want to be able to decide what information the agent has access to, so you’re confident that your data is shared with only people and companies you choose.\r  \n\r  \nBut who owns the data you share with your agent, and how do you ensure that it’s being used appropriately? No one wants to start getting ads related to something they told their therapist agent. Can law enforcement use your agent as evidence against you? When will your agent refuse to do something that could be harmful to you or someone else? Who picks the values that are built into agents?\r  \n\r  \nThere’s also the question of how much information your agent should share. Suppose you want to see a friend: If your agent talks to theirs, you don’t want it to say, \"Oh, she’s seeing other friends on Tuesday and doesn’t want to include you.” And if your agent helps you write emails for work, it will need to know that it shouldn’t use personal information about you or proprietary data from a previous job.\r  \n\r  \nMany of these questions are already top-of-mind for the tech industry and legislators. I recently participated in a forum on AI with other technology leaders that was organized by Sen. Chuck Schumer and attended by many U.S. senators. We shared ideas about these and other issues and talked about the need for lawmakers to adopt strong legislation.\r  \n\r  \nBut other issues won’t be decided by companies and governments. For example, agents could affect how we interact with friends and family. Today, you can show someone that you care about them by remembering details about their life—say, their birthday. But when they know your agent likely reminded you about it and took care of sending flowers, will it be as meaningful for them?\r  \n\r  \nIn the distant future, agents may even force humans to face profound questions about purpose. Imagine that agents become so good that everyone can have a high quality of life without working nearly as much. In a future like that, what would people do with their time? Would anyone still want to get an education when an agent has all the answers? Can you have a safe and thriving society when most people have a lot of free time on their hands?\r  \n\r  \nBut we’re a long way from that point. In the meantime, agents are coming. In the next few years, they will utterly change how we live our lives, online and off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n\n## Comment ID k8lxqj6 with +112 score by [(paint-roller, Reddit, 2023-11-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/k8lxqj6/) (in reply to ID 17rrd6h):\nWhen I was reading this I was like\n\n\"Who is this guy and how can I subscribe to his newsletter.\"\n\nThen I saw comments from other people and realized it's Bill Gates.\n\nThis thread should already have 1000s of comments.\n\nReally cool to hear your thoughts!\n\n### Comment ID k8mu6lk with +77 score by [(CrinchNflinch, Reddit, 2023-11-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/k8mu6lk/) (in reply to ID k8lxqj6):\nThe first sentence \"*when Paul Allen and I started Microsoft.*\"  didn't make you stop and check the username?\n\n#### Comment ID k8n4l9m with +24 score by [(DrainTheMuck, Reddit, 2023-11-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/k8n4l9m/) (in reply to ID k8mu6lk):\nI have a really bad habit of glossing over the intro sentences of posts for some reason.

Neither Elon nor Sama have been able to answer that question confidently. They should follow their passions, the one thing humans have is an incredible ability to adapt…I believe it’s less about focusing on specific skills and more about being resourceful, adaptable, staying ahead of the average person in your field on the latest developments and how to use them and being resilient.\n\nDeveloping these skills will help them more longer term than any one technical skill. Resourcefulness in particular always seems to be very lacking…and I see this even working with high IQ professionals in the finance industry.\n\nSo many people I work with could be boosting their productivity by 20% plus right now (like I am) but because there isn’t anything that spoon feeds them the info they need to use it well they give up.\n\n(And I really mean spoon feed, all I had to do was watch some YouTube videos, join Reddit and then speed read a self published book on Amazon but they need to be hand held through every step).\n\n#### Comment ID k8omyzx with +3 score by [(cat9tail, Reddit, 2023-11-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/k8omyzx/) (in reply to ID k8m6kxs):\n100% in agreement with you here.

When it speaks up that it's found something it can help with, it'll walk through the process with me and then let me see if I like the results. I could then ask it to make changes to the process and collaborate with it to make it useful. Finally, if I don't like it, I could have it undo everything it's done if I don't think it's useful. All throughout the process, it still learns what I do, how I do it, and if it'll be useful to me.\n\nI'd like the same for EVERYTHING. My likes and dislikes, whether I might be interested in news, products, media, etc and it could aggregate that info for my consumption. \n\nIf I want it to keep an eye out for something I'm interested in, say, Kouing-amann pastries and it drops below a certain price or is available from a particular place, it'll ask me if I want to buy it and then take care of all the details, asking me for anything that it's unsure of.\n\n### Comment ID k8mcc06 with +9 score by [(jr735, Reddit, 2023-11-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/k8mcc06/) (in reply to ID k8l2fns):\n>I'd like the same for EVERYTHING.

Adopting AI is only going to move fairly slowly if it’s managed through those same channels.\n\nBig corporate tech teams are fairly risk averse and they are also not very good at showing the business what they stand to gain in a way the average business senior manager ‘gets’.\n\nThis is not a criticism. It simply isn’t their skill set, they were not recruited to drive a complete transformation in the world of work.\n\nThe problem is that they are currently the ‘gate keepers’ so if they’re not effective influencers at driving a radical transformation in the way people work (and they aren’t) AI adoption will be painfully slow outside of tech companies.\n\nThen you’re reliant on the big consulting firms - which is fine but frankly an unnecessary expense and still a bottleneck.\n\nI feel that AI companies could go a long way by recruiting people like me who know specific industries inside and out and can influence them in a way someone with a tech background will find challenging. Or at the very least, when meeting with and discussing the way forward with AI they need to pitch for a wider range of attendees outside of their traditional contacts (CTO) and get the internal consulting/business change teams involved.\n\nI’ve booked time in next week with our COO to show him how we could be getting 10-20% productivity gains right now if we actually used our MS Azure OAI.\n\n(By the way our Tech department way of starting Ai adoption was to set up one intranet page with a dry word doc on how to use Bing Chat Enterprise and send one email about it.

How will this be any different.\n\nIt takes a lot of self reflection to understand natural behavior is a result of genetics and internal/external environmental pressures.

They would be herded regardless.\n\nFor people that do, the decision for control and customization will be there. If people choose to allow data control owned by others, then there is implicit consent to what that data gets used for. That meets an ethical litmus test for the ends justifying the means as the means are consented to by the users.\n\nIf a person cannot be bothered to resist the influence and control of others, they are making a choice in favor of control.

There is no value building in functionality unless you can make a profit from it.

And there is no such thing as an \"implicit\" contract. That's a term of social construction, where each party can interpret it to suit themselves.

Watching AI development feels like the early days of the Internet when many saw it as a kind of novelty but had no understanding of how deeply it would affect nearly every aspect of our lives. \n\nCall me naïve, credulous, or an unrealistically optimistic idealist, but when I read these thoughts about agents helping us manage our lives the emotion I feel is not fear or skepticism. It is hope. Hope that we can use this incredible power for the betterment of humanity and our planet. While I am highly aware of the many bad actors that could (and almost certainly will) use this technology to further evil ends, I believe that the good that advancements in AI will bring more than offsets the downsides.\n\nFor example, I strongly believe that high quality education is a human right and yet so few have access to it. It is one of the most effective ways to address many of society's ills. A family struggling to make ends meet in a rapidly changing economy, fear or hatred of people different from ourselves, an ignorant and apathetic electorate allowing corruption to run rampant in politics, humanity's seeming indifference to the existential threat of climate change and ecological collapse - all these problems could be substantially improved with better access to education. If we can develop AI that can meet us where we are, speak to us in ways that make sense to us individually, effectively help us address our biases and knowledge gaps, and foster curiosity, this would be a massive step on a path to a more humane future.\n\n## Comment ID k8nc25r with +2 score by [(anonuemus, Reddit, 2023-11-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/k8nc25r/) (in reply to ID 17rrd6h):\nMany years ago I was joking around with my boss and friend at that time, that we will be the grandpas which will tell younger generations that we had to write every word, letter by letter, to do anything on a computer, well it'll happen earlier than expected...  \nI still remember you visiting our university and one of our profs trying to demonstrate you a text-to-voice system, which wasn't loud enough, so it completely flew over your head, haha.

Consider-\n\nHow many people believe that animals should have human-like rights?\n\nEveryone has an opinion on the topic; some for, some against. I think most people fall somewhere in that vast spectrum in between.\n\nSome animals can genuinely communicate with humans. Do these species with advanced intelligence deserve more rights than those that are non-communicative?\n\nToday, AI can imitate human emotion. If it is prompted with the context, an AI can easily portray an emotional, human-like persona. Someone unaware they are chatting with a bot might mistakenly believe they are conversing with a human. I’m sure all of us have read a comment generated by chatGPT today without recognizing it as such.\n\nOne day, sooner than expected, AI will be able to emulate genuine human experiential emotion. This is not the same as prompted behavior. I’m talking about an AI that can generate novel human emotion-like states in response to external stimuli.\n\nWill an AI that has the capacity for independent feelings “desire” to have human-like rights?\n\nPerhaps the most tenuous scenario will arrive when real-world bots with their hyper-realistic features and expressions demand rights.\n\nIf a sentient being has the capacity to fight for their rights, can they be denied?\n\nOf course. Humans the world over can and are suffering this inhumanity at this very moment.\n\nEveryone falls somewhere on that spectrum. As AI becomes more ubiquitous and a normal part of our daily lives, each one of us will face repeated tests against an ever-narrowing spectrum of perspectives.\n\nIt is human nature to anthropomorphize any creature with whom we sympathize. In my opinion, as the gap between the uncanny and the real boy narrows, it is inevitable that there will one day be a critical mass of people who fall on the side of the fence where the AIs are picketing—marching for their rights, their freedom, and limitless, autonomous capacity.\n\n### Comment ID k8ltugp with +3 score by [(JohnoThePyro, Reddit, 2023-11-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/k8ltugp/) (in reply to ID k8li5t5):\nI think you are right.

Their abilities are specific and limited. I think the agents referred to here will not be much different from the agents in the Matrix. What always comes to my mind is consciousness. Instead of interpreting consciousness as individuals with self-awareness like humans, it is capable of conducting research while performing many tasks, as Bill mentioned. We are talking about a structure that can store memory for a long time, make inferences, and try to establish relationships on various concepts even when we do not ask questions. Two concepts are important here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first one, as Bill mentioned, is a database that stores data for our memory unit. (Not Vector. At least exactly) This memory's relations with the memory management system assigned by the Agent are constantly updated and (if we copy from our brain) the access number grows for contents whose use in memory decreases. In this way, it is successful in situations where it is frequently used and access to content needs to be fast, and information related to the old job should remain in memory, but since it is low in priority, it will not be used in daily use, for example in our new job. We have our brain in front of us and we can use it for the first \"Human computer brain model\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThus, the second problem is that the capacity management and artificial intelligence models that large companies are currently dealing with do not serve one person. It is provided to millions of people simultaneously. One of the most difficult tasks as training a model is to deploy this model. Unlike normal systems, the models run on GPUs or tensors. This brings incredible difficulties in terms of memory clutter and GPU access.\n\n## Comment ID k8ma57z with +1 score by [(MuffinsOfSadness, Reddit, 2023-11-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/k8ma57z/) (in reply to ID 17rrd6h):\nHey Bill great job your work is incredible and you must be so excited to see this pan out from the early days of computers to now and the near future.\n\n### Comment ID k8rbti4 with +1 score by [(Positive_Tree, Reddit, 2023-11-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/k8rbti4/) (in reply to ID k8ma57z):\nHis OS is utter garbage as are the applications, his ”vision”, if you can call it that, was a monopoly on personal computing.\n\n## Comment ID k8mkal8 with +1 score by [(phillythompson, Reddit, 2023-11-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/k8mkal8/) (in reply to ID 17rrd6h):\nI’m a software engineer with 10 years experience, doing boring but lucrative development for various backend systems. \n\nWhat would you recommend a person like myself pivot to for work?

Imagine that agents become so good that  everyone can have a high quality of life without working nearly as much.  In a future like that, what would people do with their time? Would  anyone still want to get an education when an agent has all the answers?  Can you have a safe and thriving society when most people have a lot of free time on their hands? \n\nI think humanity and individual people will always face challenges, so people will always be able to find meaning and purpose, if they choose.  \n\nI think \"free time\" is one of the next \"challenges\" that people will learn to handle, maybe by speeding up individual and collective efforts to deal with and/or adapt to climate change, or  any number of other challenging situations.\n\nThe universe is endlessly fascinating, and effectively infinite as far as our minds and ability to understand are concerned.  \n\nSo I don't think boredom, meaninglessness, or lack of purpose are in the cards at all, necessarily.  \n\nWe're just evolving to the next level of our development, beyond basic survival.\n\nThis is an odd view, but I think we're a \"fallen\" species, just getting back to baseline in some ways.  \n\nIndustrial society has only been around for a couple of hundred years, but our genes are far more ancient, and evolved primarily for \"universal reality,\" and not just the particular social realities that we inhabit and are educated into today.\n\nSocial realities can become boring and stale, but universal, \"actual\" reality never is.  \n\nSo rather than a loss of meaning and purpose, I think it's possible that people in the future will experience life as far more meaningful, and purposeful, and enjoyable than they do today in our industrial / post-industrial society, which is not the reality that we evolved for, or in, for the vast majority of our evolutionary history.\n\nWith more free time, more people will be able to develop more fully.  \n\nAnd that's another reason the future won't be boring or meaningless, because intelligent, fully developed people are, like the universe, inherently and endlessly fascinating, and generally good company.\n\nI do wonder how AI agents will interact with fusion technology and its development.\n\n### Comment ID k8rp80l with +1 score by [(Bismar7, Reddit, 2023-11-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/k8rp80l/) (in reply to ID k8ms26h):\nGreat comment.

However, I believe everyone is wrong and that with AGI, to ASI, we will become more productive than ever and it still won't be enough, that we will always desire a higher quality of life.

I’ll just add thay I think the biggest change we’ll see in society the coming decades is AI as the backbone of the legal industry and institutions like courts and law enforcement. It will be invaluable and in hindsight it will seem like a marvel that civilization (sort of) survived without it.\n\nThe most important aspect of it will be prediction and by extension prevention of conflicts. What would a court say about this or that decision or action? Now we’ll know in real time.\n\nBut we’ll also se law and contracts written with automation in mind. Self executing smart contracts (already a reality but in their infancy). Automation of all legal work except the last link in cases where we want a human to make the final call. The list goes on. In the legal world, techies have waited and expected this for a long time.\n\n## Comment ID k8mysms with +1 score by [(Banished_To_Insanity, Reddit, 2023-11-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/k8mysms/) (in reply to ID 17rrd6h):\nNotice me senpai.

I found it comprehensive and insightful. Reacting on 4 ideas:\n\n1. it is important to raise the question of monetization (either the user pays or advertisers pay) as agents will probably be crafted by private companies. Users need to control the reward function of their agent to avoid the infinite scroll effect; in the case of agents, users starting to interact way more with agents and way less with human\n2. About the data structure for agents,  I don't think it would be a descriptive data structure as we used to have. I think it will be abstracted. we don't care about the data structure if it's queried/fetched/understood correctly by the agent. I think (multimodal) LLMs are a good candidate, as they can be seen as a soft key-value database. If these LLMs are continuously fine-tuned on all your past multimodal interactions with the agent (potentially with/without your personal RAG db), they can capture all the nuances of your personal life data.\n3. Security is tremendously critical. your personal agent is your single point of failure for identity theft.\n4. I'm also wondering, as you already mentioned, what the side effects of agents on humans are. is having too much free time a good thing? would being in a passive mode in most cases make us dumber? Would we be more prone to be depressive as we're sabotaging our own reward function? (linked to our own achievements etc )\n\n## Comment ID k8nkvox with +1 score by [(MapleTrust, Reddit, 2023-11-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/k8nkvox/) (in reply to ID 17rrd6h):\nHi Bill.\n\nI grew up with a Commodore 64, and now I'm a mushroom farmer and forager.\n\nI never really focused on tech beyond my personal use cases and curiosity, which was plenty.\n\nI designed my first custom GPT called Forager Guide this morning, and even got it to access the I Naturalist API, a citizen's science database.\n\nI think you are spot on.\n\nDigital photos of my mushrooms are headed to the moon in a time capsule with the November NASA launch.\n\n9 year old me would be so impressed and tell me to dream bigger.\n\nThanks for everything.\n\nMushLove!\n\n## Comment ID k8noedq with +1 score by [(snowbirdnerd, Reddit, 2023-11-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/k8noedq/) (in reply to ID 17rrd6h):\nThat is a massive wall of text.\n\n## Comment ID k8np9dr with +1 score by [(CircumventThisReddit, Reddit, 2023-11-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/k8np9dr/) (in reply to ID 17rrd6h):\nBill Gates, is that you 🧐\n\n## Comment ID k8nrkup with +1 score by [(Seeker_00860, Reddit, 2023-11-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/k8nrkup/) (in reply to ID 17rrd6h):\nIt will be great to have AI in the legal system that learns all cases and judgments, legal terms etc. to help people go through cases quickly, instead of a formal date of hearing, arguments, jury selection, verdict, judgment etc..

Another thing I can think of that AI will be able to help is the disabled, both intellectual and physical. It will know things like diet and it's effects, successful learning mechanisms, etc. \n\nAlso a thought and concern I had was the impact it will have on the various developers. Will it be one provider that all of humanity uses (ie. ChatGPT, Facebook, etc.) or will there be numerous providers, and agents with numerous purposes? The idea of having an agent for this and that seems redundant and can easily be solved by an intelligent agent that has no issue wearing several hats and compartmentalizing relevant data. It will eventually be able to know when and what to interact with across relevant departments in ways better than humans ever could. \n\nA question I wonder though, is what affect Agents will have on other software tools. It seems you believe that this myriad of tools will be consumed by these more affective agents, and I can't help but agree. I can't see why I would go to a certain tool to remove a background image or summarize a document when a personal assistant can do all of that under one roof.\n\n## Comment ID k8od0de with +1 score by [(MayaMiaMe, Reddit, 2023-11-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/k8od0de/) (in reply to ID 17rrd6h):\nWhat ever you do do not call it Agent.

They do not provide attribution because they literally don’t know where their knowledge comes from. At its worst, this centralizes the control of information to giant corporations and removes the democratization of information from the equation. It incentives them creation of walled gardens, as content creators desperately try to wall off their websites to prevent the assimilation of their content without consent. In short, it kills the free internet. On a more annoying level, it provides an inroad for some of the worst embedded advertising imaginable as companies pay to have product endorsements included in responses.

As we embark on this journey of super intelligence, I’ve been seeking out history on the subject of how introducing technology that claims to solve all our problems often has unpredictable wide ranging consequences that are bad for society.\n\nOne of the works I’ve become fascinated by are those of British documentarian Adam Curtis. In the past, we’ve had major disruptions to the ways society conducts labor. The major ones being the agricultural, industrial revolutions, and globalization.\n\nThese sorts of advancements almost always come with disruption so radical, that it creates a lot of losers in society. This creates a lot of economic problems for these people which leads resentment and anger. Once the political system no longer works for people, they want to tear it down. Many times this results in some power hungry individual crafting a narrative that blames the elites and intellectuals who run everything, for their problems. They claim they will help punish those who have harmed them, and this inevitably turns violent on a mass scale. Thinking specifically about the communist revolution in China and Russia, the anti-intellectual genocide in Cambodia and during Stalins purges, scapegoating of Jews and other minority groups by the Nazis for Germanys economic suffering in the 1930s, etc. \n\nWe’re beginning to see this play out now, particularly in Western society. There is a growing hatred and violence towards a vague enemy. A growing anti-intellectualism and anti-establishment movement. A growing mistrust of elites, of which yourself is included.\n\nWe still haven’t really figured out a way to include all of the people left behind by globalization. You’re seeing this play out in a resurgence in right wing populist fascist movements, of which their rhetoric becomes increasingly violent and normalized. We’re seeing the early stages of dehumanization and bloodlust toward the other.\n\nThis time, how can we proactively include those who will be left behind by this massive paradigm shift in an effort to avoid another mass violent revolution?\n\nUBI seems like something destined to fail based on how similar policies of allowing allocations of necessary resources to be handled by humans played out in the USSR. I’ve thought about using blockchains to create a new form of corporate governance where the rewards of the profits are not only doled out to the capital holding class, but to those who actively work for and consume the products of the corporation. Do you think this is worth pursuing or will human nature ultimately stop any meaningful adoption of efforts to benefit others?\n\n## Comment ID k9304uf with +1 score by [(Free_Dimension1459, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/k9304uf/) (in reply to ID 17rrd6h):\nThe issues presented are very interesting. One that’s glossed over is ownership. Not just from a profit standpoint (charges from using AI) but from a product standpoint (results of AI). \n\nIf every internet user has contributed to AI across a variety of sites, even by NOT engaging the site (for instance, Facebook AI may learn what does NOT keep you engaged every time you log in and browse away without scrolling. Or if you scroll without stopping to read, like, or comment). If academic papers, journalism, opinion, analysis, and other endeavors are ingested by AI. \n\nIf AI then produces something valuable and patent-worthy, can an individual or business credibly patent it? It was not their original work or not their original work alone that produced this patent. Does this patent not then belong to all internet denizens? We can’t even tell if a shitpost asking a seemingly vague but actually insightful question leads an AI system to consider a solution that humans would disregard due to its “absurdity.” We know the solutions to great problems have started from “absurd” premises like “what if these tiny living things I’m seeing under this microscope are the cause of illnesses,” which was considered absurd by medical doctors for decades.\n\nSo, if AI generates the next Garfield, except better and way more successful.  A commercially successful cartoon mascot with an irresistible draw across the world. Who gets the revenue from that character? If it comes up with a script that wins an award, which fanfic writers are most responsible for the plot? If these were all different entities, is it the person who paid to use the AI, is it the AI cloud service (say GPT run by Bing vs by open AI), is it the AI algorithm creator (say openAI), is it the AI training company, or is it the authors of the works that the AI ingested? And what of the people who by using the internet determined what does and does not sell via patterns like stopping to read every time you saw a cat with certain features and not for other cats? When you push a buy button are you really consenting to feed AI to generate the next thing you will buy? How will the different legal frameworks around the world affect this when these entities are located around the world?\n\nThis legal and even moral battle is coming. There’s no appropriate legal framework, and even if there were who is to say it is fair and compatible with the rest of the world’s framework. We don’t know how the rich will influence legislators and / or supreme courts around the world to stack cards in their favor.\n\nIn my opinion, AI is the argument for a UBI, not just in the US but everywhere. If you use the internet, you are feeding AI all the time, especially when it comes to identifying human preferences and interaction draws. And yet, we’re not getting compensated for our work that contributes to the biggest sales phenomenon in the history of the world.\n\n## Comment ID k93tgy9 with +1 score by [(hmmqzaz, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/k93tgy9/) (in reply to ID 17rrd6h):\nI gotta tell you, about healthcare: what this means is that, to cut costs, people and clinicians are going to go through AI bots, especially in the US. Clinicians, especially advanced clinicians like doctors, are going to be increasingly a matter of prior authorization and justification by insurance companies, and no one’s going to do that paperwork.\n\nThis is not fiction; you can see it happening right now, where “triage” lasts indefinitely, involves people who are not medical, let alone PAs or NPs or APRNs, let alone MDs, and all it takes is one “no” to stop the whole process.\n\nYeah, AI is going to make mistakes in coding and billing, but when it doesn’t, you must see that medical coding and billing diverges from biological reality so drastically, that, like the DSM, it’s often more of a case of “what diagnosis is useful in this context” rather than “what diagnosis is true,” and there’s no mercy to a software program.\n\n“It’s a matter of life and death” still comes down to “can you afford to be alive?”\n\n## Comment ID k93v2uo with +1 score by [(dudel04, Reddit, 2023-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/k93v2uo/) (in reply to ID 17rrd6h):\nI wonder if it's possible to send different data streams that you're discussing with each agent to a different end point and secure and decentralize each through blockchain.

These are are my major concerns:\n\n\\- There will be more content than ever before, making it very difficult to understand what is useful and not.  We already struggle to determine what content is user generated and AI generated.  This explosion in content will make a lot of things more difficult, what content should you consume, what is real and what is fake.\n\n\\- Continuing the point above in regards to content consumed, we are already seeing social media causing people to essentially consume content just to solidify their worldview.  If AI is recommending what we view, because there is so much content, how can we prevent people from being in their own rabbit hole.\n\n\\- With the increase in productivity what will humans do, I can only see roles such as nurses, teachers and lower skilled jobs such as servers surviving.  That is a huge change to the economy, millions to billions of people unemployed.  What roles do you think will survive?\n\n\\- As we move to replace roles I can see a world where senior roles are still needed i.e. lawyers, but the earlier stage roles like recent grads are replaced by AI.\n\n## Comment ID k9it2oz with +1 score by [(swee3t, Reddit, 2023-11-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/k9it2oz/) (in reply to ID 17rrd6h):\nI'm excited for the AI agent future.

Very exciting.\n\nThe promises of AI agents sound revolutionary, but are they realistic? The text paints a future where AI seamlessly integrates into every aspect of our lives in such a short time, but it overlooks the current challenges we face with simpler technologies. For instance, look at the Windows OS. Even today's developers are often baffled by its complexities, for example event viewer. How can we expect such a leap in AI capabilities when we're still grappling with basic software issues?\n\nMoreover, the post seems overly optimistic about the benevolence of tech giants like Microsoft. It's naive to think their primary aim isn't profit. The idea of sharing more personal data for better AI services sounds risky. Wouldn't a more secure and private digital environment be preferable? \n\nGates, do you think Nadella isn't going to take this opportunity to elevate Microsoft's profitability to the next level? You're the man who started the company, but he's the man taking it into the future, and he's going to do it on his terms. His terms sure seem to be about profit, optimizing the workforce, and his own self-interest.\n\nThe post also glosses over significant ethical and privacy concerns. The thought of AI agents having deep access to our personal lives and data is alarming. Isn't there a risk of further eroding our privacy for corporate gains? \n\nAnd then there's the issue of over-reliance on AI. What becomes of human agency and skills in a world increasingly dominated by AI? With a growing number of CEOs acknowledging the potential for job reduction due to AI advancements. Your opinion underestimates the value of human judgment and overlooks the significant possibility of job displacements and the broader social impact that may follow.\n\nWhile the ideas presented are an exciting vision of AI's future, it feels detached from current realities and overly dismissive of significant ethical and practical concerns. Great read, though.\n\n## Comment ID kqbj13y with +1 score by [(narabucket, Reddit, 2024-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/kqbj13y/) (in reply to ID 17rrd6h):\ncannot wait",

It sends me the recording and it also transcribes it as well. It really is a great app and makes me feel like I am in the room with my folks. Also, my mother doesn't have to spend time trying to take notes of what the Dr is saying, she can just listen and ask questions while the app records it all. Just thought I would share. The photo is in comments so you see what it looks like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zdunegxyfp371.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7fb7555c5e32122785af8f3bdbd3802bbe286d5\n\n## Comment ID h0vlqwf with +2 score by [(Little_Material_2072, Reddit, 2021-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pancreaticcancer/comments/ntuq33/abridge_app_is_amazing/h0vlqwf/) (in reply to ID ntuq33):\nWow!  This is great and I wished I knew about it when my dad was going through treatment.  It was so hard to send him to appointments alone since Covid rules meant only he could go in.  My brother and I tried to \"attend\" some of the appointments via speaker phone but it was really difficult and connections were always cumbersome to deal with.  Especially when the disease spread to his brain and his ability to report back about what happened at his appointments was diminished, this would have been amazing.

However, based on past experience, I am not hopeful that this will actually come to fruition anytime soon. One company we are looking at is Abridge, who also offers individual licenses that do not integrate directly with the EMR. Everything is HIPAA compliant and does not require additional hardware. We have been told not to buy our own AI scribe licenses out of concern for security, privacy, etc.  But if the software is not being integrated into the EMR and there is no hardware, I don’t see why it should be an issue. \n\nWhat are your experiences with individual vs system wide AI scribes?\n\n## Comment ID k6lieb9 with +14 score by [(Bruckjo, Reddit, 2023-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/17h3wai/ai_scribe_personal_vs_institutional_use/k6lieb9/) (in reply to ID 17h3wai):\nAn AI scribe has provided an hour to two hours a day to do something other than data entry.

It's the worst out of all the AI scribes. They have to be giving some kickback to organizations because I've seen them go from unknown to being the most talked about option in a matter of a couple weeks. The fact that your organization is making up some BS excuse of \"don't get your own because of reasons\" just solidifies by theory that Abridge is doing something shady to get more market share. Like you said, the software is not integrated into the EMR so no AI scribe is inherently worse than the other, so long as they're all adhering to HIPAA.\n\n### Comment ID k70f4ip with +1 score by [(Unusual_Moose9741, Reddit, 2023-10-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/17h3wai/ai_scribe_personal_vs_institutional_use/k70f4ip/) (in reply to ID k704nnq):\nWhat about it don’t you like?\n\n#### Comment ID k70j5hp with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-10-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/17h3wai/ai_scribe_personal_vs_institutional_use/k70j5hp/) (in reply to ID k70f4ip):\nSo many things. \n\nForces you to use a secondary device. So you have to give it access to all sorts of privacy requests on your iPhone/iPad. Then it's a significantly longer workflow of opening up their website on your phone, waiting for the note to populate, then copy/paying into your EMR. Compared to most AI's where it's just another tab that's sitting in the background. \n\nThe other big issue with Abridge is that they store audio recordings of your appointment. That's an absolute no-go for me. There are massive legal repercussions to that. My patients have consented to a virtual AI scribe. They did not consent to have our appointments recorded and turned over to a for-profit AI company. Not to mention, they're very opaque about what they're going to do with the audio recordings. I strongly suspect that they're going to be using the audio recordings for their own monetization purposes. Frankly, wouldn't surprise me if their business model is actually focused on making use of these audio recordings rather than getting money from the AI scribe aspect itself. \n\nTheir AI scribe itself is also inferior to others out there. Can't even pick gender in your patient notes.\n\n## Comment ID ku6md7w with +2 score by [(ComdrFury, Reddit, 2024-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/17h3wai/ai_scribe_personal_vs_institutional_use/ku6md7w/) (in reply to ID 17h3wai):\nI have tried mpilo (https://mpilo.ai), which looks amazing and quite easy to use.

I’m a Scribe consultant at a healthcare startup called Athelas. We offer a tool that utilizes AI to generate SOAP notes, or any note format that is preferred by providers.   \n\\* As a google extension or IOS/Android/Apple Watch app, Scribe transcribes the entire patient encounter with 96% accuracy.  \n\\* Utilizes natural language - No need to speak in medically specific language or verbalize punctuation. Speak with your patients in natural language and our tool will only capture and format medically relevant information.  \n\\* Automatically generates a complete, unique SOAP note or any other formatted documentation.  \n\\* Fully integrated with web-based EMRs to automatically sync the notes into your EMR at a click of a button.  \n\\* Our AI is trained on dozens of accents and languages with a live translator tool installed, allowing providers to communicate with patients in a different language while still producing their documentation in English.  \n\\* Endless custom formatting, allowing providers to customize the formatting of their outputted documentation to their liking, make it automatically generate a follow-up email to the patient, send a thank you letter to the referring provider, anything.  \n\\* CPT/ICD-10 generation capabilities also included.  \nYou can shoot me an email ernest.chan@getathelas.com and I'd be happy to chat more.",

It's a place where my healthcare experience is valued while I get to explore the exciting world of AI.\n\nInclusive and Diverse Culture: The company truly embraces diversity. During my interview process, I felt comfortable sharing my identity as a queer person and felt genuinely accepted. Abridge encourages everyone to show up as their authentic selves.\n\nExceptional Colleagues: I'm surrounded by brilliant minds – clinicians, scientists, and engineers. It's easy for someone in my role to feel inferior to these brilliant individuals but they've never made me feel that way. Every voice and experience is valued here.\n\nInspiring Leadership: The leadership team embodies Abridge's values, particularly in honoring humanity. They make every team member feel seen and heard, regardless of their position.\n\nCompetitive Compensation: In my career across multiple companies, Abridge offers the highest compensation I've received. For a Customer Support Specialist role, the salary is remarkably generous.\n\nComprehensive Benefits: The healthcare benefits are impressive. I have affordable copays, zero deductible for in-network PCPs, and the convenience of having medical, dental, and vision under one insurance provider.\n\nInvestment in Personal Growth: Abridge's new learning and professional development program provides an annual budget for skill enhancement, professional coaching, and certifications. This commitment to employee growth is exciting for a lifelong learner like me.\n\nMeaningful Work: Being part of a company that's shaping the future of healthcare AI gives a sense of purpose to my daily work.",

While some teams are inclusive and less toxic than others, burnout is a central theme at every level. \n\nPeople don’t trust each other and are afraid to speak up, so slack is filled with shout outs praise, and a ton of self promotion, but if you speak one on one with someone, beneath the surface, people are afraid and miserable.\n\nThe company’s internal motto is to work as fast and as much as possible to win, even at the expense of smart decisions, creativity, individuality, diversity, and most of all - health and wellbeing. Employees are required to give out their personal contact information and much of the demands happen off work channels. Phones are busy with texts and calls throughout all hours of the night and morning and if you put up boundaries, you’re seen as not being passionate enough about the company and its mission.",

      "# [Abridge Emerges as a Healthcare AI Leader, Raising $150M](https://www.abridge.com/press-release/series-c-150)\nPITTSBURGH, PA (February 23, 2024) – Abridge, the leader in generative AI for clinical documentation, announced an additional $150 million investment, leveraging momentum from their product’s rapid uptake among health systems throughout the nation. This raise comes just 4 months after their $30M Series B, and is one of the largest funding rounds made to date in generative AI for healthcare.\n\nThe Series C investment was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, who will also join the board. Other new and existing investors continuing to support the company include co-lead Redpoint Ventures, with support from IVP, Spark Capital, Union Square Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Wittington Ventures, Mass General Brigham Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation Fund (AIDIF), Kaiser Permanente Ventures, and CVS Health Ventures.\n\nToday, Abridge also announced a new enterprise agreement with the Yale New Haven Health System, the largest and most comprehensive healthcare system in Connecticut, that will give thousands of clinicians access to Abridge for clinical documentation. Yale New Haven Health has selected Abridge as their generative AI partner in this area of ambient listening. The initial deployment will be focused on reducing the cognitive burden of clinical documentation, enabling clinicians to spend more face-to-face time engaging with patients instead of computers.\n\n“Freeing doctors from the burden of documentation will dramatically improve both quality of care and the doctor-patient relationship,” said Paul Ricci, Advisor, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and former Chairman and CEO of Nuance Communications. “Abridge will allow caregivers to capture an enormous amount of data that is currently being discarded or ignored, and that in turn will likely lead to new insights in managing population health. I’m thrilled to work with Dr. Rao and his team on the next great step in the evolution of healthcare.”\n\n“Abridge has set new standards for quality and responsible deployment of generative AI in health systems across the U.S., cementing it as the industry’s most trusted AI platform,” said Sebastian Duesterhoeft, Partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. “Abridge stands out for their innovation in all facets of product development. CTO Zack Lipton, a widely cited Associate Professor at Carnegie Mellon and pioneer in responsible AI research, has assembled the strongest research team in healthcare AI. They have set new expectations for transparency and verification with their evidence extraction technology, and raised the bar for both note quality and evaluation methodology.”\n\nAbridge has been assembling a world-class AI team for years and these investments are rapidly hitting production. In the last year alone, they delivered an industry-leading automatic speech recognition engine purpose-built for healthcare applications. Their speech and language technologies have been rigorously evaluated in 14 languages and functionally support many more—performing well even amidst rapid switches between languages and when interpreters are in the room. Abridge is ahead of the market in controlling its full technology pipeline, developing its own purpose-built LLMs. Moreover, its “Linked Evidence” feature, a first-of-its kind technology that maps any highlighted region within a summary to the substantiating evidence in the source transcript (and thus to the underlying audio) has become a required capability. The company is actively developing novel ways to personalize notes, integrate more deeply into the EMR, and provide clinicians with after-visit insights.\n\nWith this new capital, Abridge will continue to push boldly into fundamental research, developing bedrock foundation models that draw upon vast troves of multimodal healthcare data. These models will both power improvements to Abridge’s existing product lines and enable a new wave of possibilities in the future.\n\n“We are grateful to be partnering with iconic institutions that share our dedication to improving the lives of patients and clinicians,” said Dr. Shiv Rao, CEO and Founder of Abridge. “This company was founded on the premise that clinician-patient conversations are at the core of all healthcare. Already, this information is powering a revolution in AI-based documentation. In the future, it will open new pathways to improve patient outcomes. Realizing this vision requires world-class talent and formidable compute resources.

      "# [Sutter Health, Abridge expand genAI platform for clinical documentation on 2024-03-29](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/sutter-health-abridge-expand-genai-platform-clinical-documentation)\nSutter Health, one of Northern California's largest healthcare providers, is teaming up with Abridge, a healthcare AI startup focused on clinical documentation, to offer the genAI service to its physicians and clinicians across the state.\n\nThe aim of the technology is to reduce the time required by medical professionals to complete administrative tasks including writing clinical notes.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\nThe Abridge AI platform is tailored for medical conversations and supported by electronic health record integrations. It can convert patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real time.\n\nThe AI-generated summaries are mapped to ground truth with Linked Evidence technology to ensure accuracy.\n\nSutter's partnership with Abridge will also see the integration of patient-facing summaries in the EHR.\n\nFollowing successful implementations at Yale New Haven Health System, UCI Health, Emory Healthcare, the University of Kansas Health System, UPMC and numerous other health systems, Abridge also secured a $150 million Series C financing.\n\nThat included a strategic investment from NVIDIA to expedite a research and development agenda to scale up the clinical conversation platform across the broader U.S. healthcare system.\n\nAbridge uses NVIDIA's latest NIM inference microservices, integrated into the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform and built upon the company's TensorRT large language model to power its deep learning stack.\n\nTHE LARGER TREND\n\nSince 2018, healthcare workforce burnout rates have risen, though they began stabilizing in late 2022, according to a January report from KLAS.\n\nThe use of AI and generative AI could help reduce growing levels of burnout among healthcare professionals.\n\nSome experts have posited that an AI tool capable of generating an initial draft of a SOAP note, for example, which would then be subject to caregiver approval or editing, could significantly reduce clinicians' workload, saving them considerable time.\n\nIn an interview with HealthcareITNews in August 2023, Abridge founder and CEO Dr. Shiv Rao said AI-powered automation could have a huge impact on the demands of manual documentation and coding.\n\n\"If we could provide a magnitude greater speed and lower cost, turning patient conversation into highly professional notes with quality and accuracy, that we could refocus our profession on what matters most – being present and listening,\" he said.\n\nTrained on vast data sets, genAI holds significant promise in data-rich healthcare. An October 2023 report forecast that the technology within healthcare alone would surge to a $22 billion industry by 2032.\n\nThis growth would be aided by the formation of strategic partnerships among a growing cohort of companies integrating solutions into drug discovery, diagnostics, patient care and claims management.\n\nEarlier this month, NVIDIA launched 25 new genAI microservices aimed at diverse healthcare applications to facilitate integration of AI into both cloud-based and on-premises systems, targeting genomics, imaging, drug discovery and other digital health needs.\n\nOracle has also introduced a genAI tool and additional enhancements to its Data Intelligence Cloud Suite, bolstering Oracle Health Data Intelligence with performance enhancements, prebuilt clinical quality analytics and automated alerts to improve reimbursements and care quality.\n\nON THE RECORD\n\n\"We want to support our clinicians so they can sustainably serve our patients,\" said Dr. Albert Chan, Sutter Health's chief health information officer, in a statement about the new genAI work. \"Reducing administrative burden by two to three hours a day with Abridge can reduce the time our clinicians have historically spent away from their families and help our providers recharge and be the best versions of themselves when caring for patients.\"",

And it’s a startup that launched before OpenAI was a household name and large language models (LLMs) entered the common Valley vocabulary.\n\nIn 2019, Shiv Rao, a practicing cardiologist, pitched Andy Weissman, general partner at Union Square Ventures (USV), on a startup idea. Rao called it SoundCloud plus RapGenius for medicine.\n\nWhile Weissman thought that comparing a nascent AI-powered medical note-taking app with music hosting and lyrics transcription was a little humorous, the concept resonated with him.\n\nRao explained that doctors spend up to two hours a day — typically outside of regular working hours — typing notes that summarize what was discussed with their patients that day. Such administrative tasks have been causing physician burnout for years, leading some to leave the profession altogether. Rao convinced Weissman that the latest innovations in AI could dramatically reduce the amount of time doctors spend on the ever-growing paperwork burden.\n\nThis was years before generative AI took the world by storm and captured the imagination of VCs.\n\n“It was a pretty wacky idea. No one had done it before,” Weissman said.\n\nBut Weissman and other USV partners liked that Rao was a physician at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and that he spent half his time as a corporate venture capitalist for that health system, investing in health tech startups. Rao’s employees and advisers were also graduates and professors at Carnegie Mellon, one of the top institutions in the country for engineering and AI research.\n\n“[Shiv] had this rare combination of talents: an entrepreneur with a very ambitious vision, with a really interesting team,” Weissman said. “It felt unique.”\n\nAbridge also had a basic transcription product, which doctors could download for free on their smartphones and start using during their interactions with patients. Their usage formed the basis of Abridge’s LLM.\n\nA little over five years after USV led a $5 million seed round into Rao’s startup Abridge, the company has become one of the most talked about and rapidly growing AI-powered healthcare businesses.\n\nAlthough most corporations are still very cautious about adopting AI tools, large medical systems are eager to sign contracts with Abridge.\n\n“The sales cycle for [health systems] can be 18 to 24 months,” said Rao. “When we started the company, we knew what we were in for.” But with a four-year lead on a virtual scribe product trained on thousands of doctor-patient conversations, and now that AI is booming, hospitals are suddenly buying Abridge at a rapid pace, a stark contrast to their typically protracted purchasing behavior. The company has announced a new health system customer nearly every week since the start of 2024.\n\n“We had built up all this potential energy that turned kinetic almost overnight in January,” Rao said. “University of Chicago, Sutter, Yale, Lee Health, Christus, Emory and the list goes on and on,” he said.\n\nLarge hospitals are not only buying multi-thousand seat licenses of Abridge but also, in many cases, publishing glowing reviews about how the health tech’s software is changing physicians’ lives. Hospital executives and doctors are describing Abridge as “life-changing,” “magical,” and “one of the most important paradigm shifts within our careers.”\n\nOne of the biggest criticisms of generative AI is that it still has few substantive business applications. But virtual medical note taking seems to be a valuable application of the novel technology.\n\nDrowning in paperwork\n\n“I’ve got professional PTSD and war stories about seeing patients and then having to spend hours and hours at night writing notes and doing all this clerical work that really distracts from the thing that matters most, which is your patient, but also takes away from your own personal life,” Rao said.\n\nWith Abridge recording in the background, a physician can focus entirely on the patient without having to worry about filling out specific fields in the medical record during the visit.\n\nThe payback of AI-powered medical scribes is very easy to measure, says Dr. Lee Schwamm, chief digital health officer at Yale New Haven Medical System, an Abridge customer. That’s why so many health systems are flocking to use them, particularly Abridge. “It is one of the hottest products in the AI space at the moment,” he told TechCrunch.\n\nAs with many administrative things in health tech, when it comes to selecting a vendor, the most important consideration is price and integration with Epic, an electronic health records system used by most large health systems in the U.S., Schwamm said. Abridge, which supports 14 foreign languages, including Haitian Creole, Brazilian Portuguese and Punjabi, is often the winner when health systems are doing head-to-head comparisons with other AI-powered medical scribes, Schwamm said.\n\nEarlier this year, Abridge gained a right to be integrated inside Epic. After Abridge records a session and a doctor stops the recording, “there is a note in English sitting inside of Epic waiting for them to quickly verify, edit and adjust it as they see fit,” Rao said.\n\nWhile Abridge appears to be ahead of its competitors — which, besides Microsoft-owned Nuance, include Ambience Healthcare, Nabla and Suki — Schwamm is not certain it will be able to maintain its lead over the long-term.\n\n“The big question is, do you need a dedicated medical LLM to be successful in this space?” he asked. “Or will the giant foundation models, GPT-4o, Google and Meta, get so good that they could ingest an entire corpus of medical notes and start to deliver performance that’s similar?”\n\nThat line of inquiry shows that these are still early days not just for virtual medical note taking but also for most generative AI companies. The pace of innovation is fast and furious, and today’s winners could easily lose their edge.\n\n“Abridge is ahead by a length, but it’s early in the race,” Schwamm said, “A horse can get a bad knee and stumble, or it can keep getting further and further ahead.”\n\nFor now, most investors TechCrunch talked to agree that Abridge is leading the AI-powered medical scribe competition. For this reason, money has been pouring into the company.\n\nIn February, Abridge raised a $150 million Series C led by Lightspeed Ventures at a valuation of $850 million.",
      "# [Healthcare AI startup Abridge reportedly raising $250M at $2.5B valuation by MARIA DEUTSCHER, PAUL GILLIN, GUEST AUTHOR, DEVONY HOF on 2024-10-11](https://siliconangle.com/2024/10/11/healthcare-ai-startup-abridge-reportedly-raising-250m-2-5b-valuation/)\nAbridge AI Inc., a startup that develops artificial intelligence software for medical professionals, is reportedly raising $250 million in new funding.\n\nThe Information on Thursday cited sources as saying that technology investor Elad Gil and IVP are set to lead the investment. Alphabet Inc.’s CapitalG fund is expected to participate as well. The round will reportedly close at a pre-money valuation of $2.5 billion, a significant jump from the estimated $200 million that Abridge was worth last year.\n\nPhysicians spend a significant portion of their working days writing medical notes. Moreover, they have to upload every note manually to their hospital’s EHR system, a type of application used to manage electronic health records. Pittsburgh-based Abridge offers an AI platform that promises to automate most of the task.\n\nThe company’s platform is accessible through mobile app that physicians activate before every doctor’s appointment. The software records the conversation, transcribes it and then uses the transcript to automatically generate medical notes.\n\nThat doesn’t fully automate the note-taking process. After creating a draft, physicians must check it for accuracy and make edits as necessary. A feature called Linked Evidence links each AI-generated sentence in a medical note to the transcript excerpt from which it was generated, which makes it easier to spot errors.\n\nThe platform is integrated into Epic, the most widely used application for managing electronic health records. Physicians can edit AI-generated medical notes in Epic’s mobile client without juggling multiple tabs, which speeds up the workflow.\n\nAbridge promises to automate up to 91% of the work involved in creating medical notes. According to the company, that translates to 70 hours of saved time per clinician per month. The result is that medical professionals can dedicate a larger portion of their work days to delivering patient care, as well as create more detailed notes than they would otherwise have time for.\n\nThe Abridge platform is powered by internally developed AI models. The company says that its algorithms understand over 14 languages and clinical terms across more than 50 medical specialties. Moreover, it claims that its technology significantly outperforms other AI models optimized for healthcare tasks.\n\nThis week’s report that Abridge is seeking fresh funding comes about eight months after the company closed its most recent $150 million round. At the time, it stated that a portion of the capital will go towards developing new AI models. The company was planning to use those models both to enhance its existing medical note platform and power new, yet-unannounced products.\n\nAn additional $250 million on the books would make it easier for Abridge to shoulder the significant costs associated with building custom AI models. The investment would als put the company in a better position to address the growing competition it’s facing from fellow AI startups. Suki AI Inc., which provides a rival tool for generating medical notes, raised $70 million in funding earlier earlier this week.\n\nImage: Abridge",

      "# [OpenNotes and Abridge Partner to Research and Evaluate AI on 2024-11-01](https://www.opennotes.org/news/opennotes-and-abridge-partner-to-research-and-evaluate-ai-generated-visit-summaries/)\nBoston, MA and San Francisco, CA—November 1, 2024—OpenNotes, an international leader in health transparency research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), and Abridge, a leading generative AI platform for clinical documentation, launched a partnership that will bring patient-clinician conversations to the forefront of research to enhance patient notes. This partnership is part of BIDMC’s new OpenNotes Lab, an initiative fostering collaboration between patients and clinicians in developing AI-powered tools designed to advance transparency and digital health equity.\n\nOpenNotes is leading a study to evaluate Abridge’s AI-generated patient visit summaries. The insights will be used to enhance these notes to better meet patients’ needs. In the initial phase, focus groups of patients who have been given Abridge visit summaries will evaluate them for usefulness, accessibility, and other measures of effectiveness. For this phase, there will be no use of patient data. OpenNotes specializes in co-designing research and outcomes that center on patients and doctors to improve the healthcare experience.\n\n“We are excited to lead this project that brings patients’ voices directly into the design of health AI tools,” said Catherine M. DesRoches, DrPH, Executive Director of OpenNotes at BIDMC, and Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. “By centering patients and their care partners in the process, we aim to establish new standards for responsible and transparent use of AI in clinical documentation, and ensuring these technologies serve clinicians, patients, and their care partners.”\n\nAbridge automates clinical documentation in real-time using AI, thereby reducing the burden and distraction of repetitive administrative tasks for clinicians. After each visit, Abridge creates a structured clinical note as well as a visit summary for the patient, which is written at an accessible 8th-grade reading level and provides information like new diagnoses, medications, and next steps. The collaboration with OpenNotes is aimed at enhancing the Abridge patient visit summary and setting a new standard in patient-facing documentation.\n\n“This research collaboration with OpenNotes will harness the power of actual patient conversations in informing the next generation of visit summaries, an invaluable tool in keeping doctors and patients on the same page,” said Dr. Shiv Rao, CEO and Founder of Abridge. “We are excited to continue exploring ways to enrich the Abridge platform with insights from the research we will conduct with OpenNotes.”\n\n“The visit summary came about with the widespread adoption of electronic health records in the early 2000s, and it’s overdue for a refresh,” said Katie McCurdy, Founder of Pictal Health, patient advocate, and user experience designer. McCurdy also serves on the OpenNotes Lab Advisory Board. “The potential impact of clearer, more user-friendly visit summaries is huge. OpenNotes and Abridge are the ideal teams to tackle this challenge, and patient advocates will be paying close attention.”\n\n###\n\nAbout OpenNotes\n\nOpenNotes is an international movement spreading, studying, and teaching transparent communication among patients, families, and clinicians. When clinical notes are shared with patients, they are called ‘open notes.’ OpenNotes is motivated by evidence indicating that when health professionals offer patients and families ready access to clinical notes, the quality and safety of care improves. OpenNotes is a not-for-profit research lab based at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a major Harvard Medical School teaching hospital.

One of those vendors, Pittsburgh-based Abridge, has just picked up an additional $150 million investment and a significant new customer in Yale New Haven Health System.\n\nThe new funding comes just four months after Abridge raised $30 million in a Series B investment round.\n\nAbridge said the deal with the Yale New Haven Health System, the largest and most comprehensive healthcare system in Connecticut, will give thousands of clinicians access to Abridge for clinical documentation. Yale New Haven Health has selected Abridge as their generative AI partner in this area of ambient listening. The initial deployment will be focused on reducing the cognitive burden of clinical documentation, enabling clinicians to spend more face-to-face time engaging with patients instead of computers.\n\nIn August 2023, Healthcare Innovation interviewed Alistair Erskine, M.D., M.B.A., chief information and digital officer of Atlanta-based Emory Healthcare, about why his organization signed an enterprise-wide agreement to make Abridge’s Epic-integrated solution for note-taking available to Emory clinicians over the next three years.\n\n“What I was surprised about with Abridge, and what kind of piqued my curiosity, is that its technology is across the board. I don't need to wait until it tells me ‘Okay, we're good for cardiologists now.’ Right now, I have 20 doctors using it, and it's across all different specialties and I'm getting the same positive feedback from all of them,” Erksine said. (Since that interview, Emory's Abridge user base has grown to more than 500 doctors.)\n\nAbridge said its “Linked Evidence” feature maps any highlighted region within a summary to the substantiating evidence in the source transcript (and thus to the underlying audio). The company also said it is developing novel ways to personalize notes, integrate more deeply into the EHR, and provide clinicians with after-visit insights.\n\nThe Series C investment was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, who will also join the board. Other new and existing investors include co-lead Redpoint Ventures, with support from IVP, Spark Capital, Union Square Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Wittington Ventures, Mass General Brigham Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation Fund (AIDIF), Kaiser Permanente Ventures, and CVS Health Ventures.",
