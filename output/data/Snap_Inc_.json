      "# [Improving Djinni](https://eng.snap.com/improving_djinni)\nC++ is an important part of Snap’s client development strategy due to its portability along with its ability to utilize the full potential of client hardware. It powers Snap’s Lens technology which is used in the Snapchat mobile app, Lens Studio, and Snap Camera. It also powers our voice and video calling, messaging, mobile UI frameworks, and a growing set of client infrastructure components.\n\nDjinni is a project originally created by Dropbox that generates bridging code between C++ and other programming languages. It consists of an interface definition language (IDL), a code generator, and a small support library. Using interfaces generated by Djinni allows developers to seamlessly integrate components across Java and Objective-C while retaining the original feel of each language.\n\nWe chose to use Djinni as our cross-platform middleware because of its focus on mobile development and its ease of use. Today, the majority of Snapchat’s C++ code is exposed as Djinni interfaces. As our usage of Djinni grew, we saw opportunities to improve its performance, stability, and features to better suit our needs. In this post we will take a closer look at some of the improvements we made to Djinni.\n\nDropbox stopped maintaining the original Djinni repository in 2018. But even before that, we at Snap had already developed an internal fork of it. This fork is now public on Github and Snap is committed to ongoing development and maintenance of this repository.\n\nString marshalling performance\n\nA common concern amongst Android developers is the performance of calling library functions over Djinni’s generated Java Native Interface (JNI) code. We built a performance test app to measure the actual cost of these calls. What immediately caught our attention was that it was slow to pass large strings across the JNI boundary. For example, passing a 16KB string took more than 2 milliseconds on a fairly fast device. That is quite expensive for just one argument in one single call.\n\nAfter some research, we discovered that the bottleneck was in Djinni’s string encoding and decoding routines. These functions convert between C++ std::string (assumed to be standard UTF-8 encoding) and Java’s modified UTF-8, which JNI functions expect. Because modified UTF-8 is a Java-specific encoding, it does not have a ready to use implementation in the C++ standard library. Djinni used a handwritten implementation which was not tuned for performance.\n\nWe experimented with a few methods to optimize this code and eventually settled on encoding C++ strings to standard UTF-16, which JNI functions can also accept. Switching to a standard encoding means we could take advantage of the high quality string encoding implementation in the C++ standard library. The string conversion functions went from 250 lines to just 37 lines while running much faster than before.\n\nOur tests showed an improvement of 3-10x depending on string size (except for tiny strings of size < 16, where the overhead of the JNI call dominates):\n\nZero-copy buffers\n\nSnapchat passes large chunks of binary data back and forth across the Djinni boundary. For example, media files, uncompressed video frames, or large serialized objects.\n\nDjinni’s only option for passing binary data was the “binary” type, which copies data every time it crosses the boundary. This approach is straightforward and works well with small data objects. But when the data being passed gets bigger, the cost of copying can become significant.\n\nTo address this limitation, we developed a pair of new types to support passing data without copying: DataView and DataRef:\n\nDataView is a non-owning viewport into a memory buffer. This is the fastest way to share data across the boundary as the only thing passed is a (pointer, size) pair. Being just a pointer to the memory, it is the programmer’s responsibility to keep the memory around while it’s being accessed on the other side of the Djinni boundary.\n\nDataRef, on the other hand, is a native wrapper for a platform data object (ByteBuffer on Android and NSData on iOS). For example, on Android, when you create a DataRef object in C++, you essentially create a ByteBuffer object in the JVM heap, managed by the new DataRef object. This is why it’s called DataRef, as it works as a reference to the actual platform data object.\n\nUnlike DataView, the ByteBuffer and NSData objects created by DataRef own their buffers. It is therefore safe to keep these ByteBuffer and NSData objects beyond the scope they are called with.\n\nIn short, if you need the ByteBuffer/NSData objects to keep the memory buffer alive then use DataRef. If you do not need them to manage the lifetime of the buffer and simply want a viewport into the memory managed elsewhere, then use DataView as it’s cheaper to create and pass.\n\nOne cool trick the DataRef class has is that in C++ it can take over the memory of a std::vector<uint8_t> or std::string without copying it, if you construct it with an R-value reference like this:\n\nAfter the DataRef constructor call, the original vector becomes empty. Its data is moved into the DataRef object, which will continue to live on the other side of the Djinni boundary. This is an efficient way to pass large C++ vectors and have the Java/ObjC side taking ownership of the data.\n\nEliminating Java Finalizers\n\nSince Djinni sits at the foundation of the Snapchat app’s C++ components, stability is of the utmost importance to us. One of the first problems we noticed after adopting Djinni was these finalizer crashes in Android:\n\nThe crash stacks were different each time, but they all happened in the Djinni generated CppProxy class’s finalizers. The CppProxy classes are what Java code uses to access C++ objects. They manage lifetime of a C++ object by calling its nativeDestroy() method in a finalizer:\n\nThis code is not incorrect by itself. The culprit is when this is combined with the way Android’s garbage collection loop operates. A simplified version of it looks like this:\n\nIf a GC cycle happens while the app is entering background mode, the Android system can suspend the process at the context switch to native code, in the finalizer. When the process resumes, it will see a very long execution time and raise a TimeoutException, even though the finalizer wasn’t running at all while suspended.\n\nThe chance of the OS suspending our process in the middle of a GC cycle is very low, so these crashes do not happen all that often. You probably will never see it if you only test your apps locally. But at Snapchat's scale, we have to make sure even the slightest chance of failure is addressed.\n\nTo fix this issue, we changed the code generator to make CppProxy objects register themselves with a NativeObjectManager object in their constructors and removed the finalizer code completely. This means we take over the task of finalizing native objects from the JVM and do it ourselves in a dedicated low priority cleanup thread outside of the Java GC.\n\nAs this change rolled out to users, we stopped seeing TimeoutExceptions in CppProxy objects.\n\nSummary\n\nSnap’s Djinni fork provides significant stability and performance improvements over the original version. These are just a few examples of them.",
      "# [Safety News & Updates - Social Impact on 2024-10-04](https://values.snap.com/news?lang=da-DK)\nWe’re beginning to test a new introductory experience in limited markets for older teens on Snapchat ages 16 and 17 who are interested in sharing content they create with a wider audience.\n\nSnapchat, in collaboration with the UK internet safety charity Childnet, has developed a new guide for parents to help them to have open and honest conversations about online safety with their children.\n\nIt’s back to school in many parts of the world and what better time to remind teens, parents, and educators about the importance of reporting safety concerns to online platforms and services.\n\nEarlier this year, we announced the selection of Snap’s inaugural Council for Digital Well-Being, a pilot program in the U.S. designed to hear from teens on the state of life online today, as well as their hopes and ideals for more positive and rewarding online experiences. In May, we officially kicked off Council activities, and we are excited to introduce this thoughtful and engaging group.\n\nToday, we're sharing how we are committed to fostering a positive and safe environment for our community during the Paris 2024 Olympics and Paralympics.\n\nToday, Snap is honored to join two fellow tech companies, the government, and the United Nations (UN) in launching The Alliance to Prevent Drug Harms."

It’s concerning how a platform can impose such stringent actions without considering the context of user interactions. If playful engagement with stickers led to a ban, it raises questions about the platform's ability to differentiate between genuinely harmful behavior and harmless fun.\nMoreover, the support provided by Snapchat in this situation appears to be lacking. Users expect fair treatment and responsive communication when issues arise, and it's disheartening when that support is inadequate. If there were an option to give zero stars, it would reflect the disappointment and lack of accountability in addressing user concerns.

So i’ve had snapchat since you could see your friends top 3 best friends, before there were all of these extra features, before there were stories, or memories. Slowly but surely they have put more and more things that are very unlikeable into the app. I have snapchat plus (i wanted to try it out) and the only singular thing i like is being able to see when people peek into the chat.\nThe AI having to stay pinned to the top, I promise you i have never used that AI and i do not plan on it. A lot of us are hesitant as there have been some weird interactions and things that have happened with this AI. So to shove it down our throats and pin it on the top of the screen is ridiculous. \nAs well as they still try to charge people for stupid clothing for the bitmojis when a lot of us are already paying monthly for snapchat plus is insane, i kind of just assumed if i was paying for an app that was known for being free for everybody to use, that they wouldn’t try to charge me for more. \nThe bitmojis, they were super cool when they first came around! Yet somehow they found a way to make them not look like bitmojis and half of the time it looks completely different in the editing of it, and then you see it on the top of your snapchat profile and it’s actually horrendous, they look all bumpy and the hair never looks normal or even close to what it looks like in the editor. They take the good things they did have on the app that people really like and just ruin them.\nI would like to add to another review i read earlier about also having very vulgar content that never used to be allowed. For some reason they’ll permanently ban your account, including all your memories, which i don’t know about yall but i have YEARS of pictures that if i lost, i would be heartbroken and have seen people experience it. You’d think that since they have memories as such an important part of the app they’d find some way to get them to you as i’ve heard of many peoples request for that being declined (and by perma ban they ban your IP so if you’re wanting a new snapchat you’re gonna need a new phone, and i’ve even seen that not work as u can’t use the same number or email or they’ll ban that IP as well) for posting a snapchat with a caption that has anything to do with marijuana even though it’s legal in half of the states, i’ve even heard of people getting banned people somebody went through and reported them, when sometimes reports are just from petty drama and stupid things like that.  They don’t even give you a chanc, you’d think 3 strikes your out or something with it being such a prominent app in almost every persons phone, yet it won’t delete an account for trying to promote sexual activity, sometimes illegal sexual activity. Which i can say i’ve reported myself and seen nothing happen. This app has gone downhill, all they care about is money in these past years and i am one more update away from deleting it.",

But, a couple things that would make this review a 5 star review is that there should be an option to permanently save snaps in chats. It’s super inconvenient and annoying to save every snap. Even with the 24 hour option you still have to click every snap to save it so it’s not that helpful. The other thing is that when you save a snap video in the chat it saves as a bunch of small clips instead of just the full video. It ruins the whole video. It also takes up so much space within the chat. It’s frustrating. It would be nice to just watch and save a full video without a bunch of mini clips of that one video. If these two things were changed I would use this app way more! Hopefully soon those options and changes happen soon! 🤞🏼",

I’ve had it for 6 years, almost 7 but while having the app I’ve been banned twice. I’ve also had Snap+ on two of the accounts. My new one and my recent account that got banned I paid $30 for a year and not even halfway through the year I got banned for no reason. What a waste of money!!! I’m on a third account now and have Snap+ again. I’ve had this new account for 3 months now and I haven’t gotten any warning that I’m aware officially. I always report people for posting inappropriate things but I get an email saying it doesn’t violate your guidelines? But whenever I post something while I’m swimming with friends I get reported for nudity and I get banned. I also post conversations between me and creeps on the app to warn others yet I get reported for bullying and harassment when I’m the one being harassed. Too many people are getting banned for the wrong reasons. Mainly girls too. Instead of adding new features like “see friends in chat” or the way our bitmoji looks you guys should fix your guidelines and your banning process. I’ve lost hundreds of photos that were in my memories. I was so upset. I lost all my friends with no way of getting them back.",

      "# Snapchat is pathetic!, 1 stars [(Duale Jibril, Apple App Store, 2024-10-06)](https://apple/11806464900)\nI was device banned from Snapchat for sending joking stickers it is incredibly frustrating, especially when the intent was light-hearted. It’s concerning how a platform can impose such stringent actions without considering the context of user interactions. If playful engagement with stickers led to a ban, it raises questions about the platform's ability to differentiate between genuinely harmful behavior and harmless fun.\nMoreover, the support provided by Snapchat in this situation appears to be lacking. Users expect fair treatment and responsive communication when issues arise, and it's disheartening when that support is inadequate. If there were an option to give zero stars, it would reflect the disappointment and lack of accountability in addressing user concerns. Such experiences highlight the importance of better moderation and customer support in digital platforms to foster a more positive environment for all users.",

      "# all they want is our money, 1 stars [(blueberrypancakesss, Apple App Store, 2024-10-04)](https://apple/11797765453)\nThis is a long one. So i’ve had snapchat since you could see your friends top 3 best friends, before there were all of these extra features, before there were stories, or memories. Slowly but surely they have put more and more things that are very unlikeable into the app. I have snapchat plus (i wanted to try it out) and the only singular thing i like is being able to see when people peek into the chat.\nThe AI having to stay pinned to the top, I promise you i have never used that AI and i do not plan on it. A lot of us are hesitant as there have been some weird interactions and things that have happened with this AI. So to shove it down our throats and pin it on the top of the screen is ridiculous. \nAs well as they still try to charge people for stupid clothing for the bitmojis when a lot of us are already paying monthly for snapchat plus is insane, i kind of just assumed if i was paying for an app that was known for being free for everybody to use, that they wouldn’t try to charge me for more. \nThe bitmojis, they were super cool when they first came around! Yet somehow they found a way to make them not look like bitmojis and half of the time it looks completely different in the editing of it, and then you see it on the top of your snapchat profile and it’s actually horrendous, they look all bumpy and the hair never looks normal or even close to what it looks like in the editor. They take the good things they did have on the app that people really like and just ruin them.\nI would like to add to another review i read earlier about also having very vulgar content that never used to be allowed. For some reason they’ll permanently ban your account, including all your memories, which i don’t know about yall but i have YEARS of pictures that if i lost, i would be heartbroken and have seen people experience it. You’d think that since they have memories as such an important part of the app they’d find some way to get them to you as i’ve heard of many peoples request for that being declined (and by perma ban they ban your IP so if you’re wanting a new snapchat you’re gonna need a new phone, and i’ve even seen that not work as u can’t use the same number or email or they’ll ban that IP as well) for posting a snapchat with a caption that has anything to do with marijuana even though it’s legal in half of the states, i’ve even heard of people getting banned people somebody went through and reported them, when sometimes reports are just from petty drama and stupid things like that.  They don’t even give you a chanc, you’d think 3 strikes your out or something with it being such a prominent app in almost every persons phone, yet it won’t delete an account for trying to promote sexual activity, sometimes illegal sexual activity. Which i can say i’ve reported myself and seen nothing happen. This app has gone downhill, all they care about is money in these past years and i am one more update away from deleting it.",

But, a couple things that would make this review a 5 star review is that there should be an option to permanently save snaps in chats. It’s super inconvenient and annoying to save every snap. Even with the 24 hour option you still have to click every snap to save it so it’s not that helpful. The other thing is that when you save a snap video in the chat it saves as a bunch of small clips instead of just the full video. It ruins the whole video. It also takes up so much space within the chat. It’s frustrating. It would be nice to just watch and save a full video without a bunch of mini clips of that one video. If these two things were changed I would use this app way more! Hopefully soon those options and changes happen soon! 🤞🏼",

I’m on a third account now and have Snap+ again. I’ve had this new account for 3 months now and I haven’t gotten any warning that I’m aware officially. I always report people for posting inappropriate things but I get an email saying it doesn’t violate your guidelines? But whenever I post something while I’m swimming with friends I get reported for nudity and I get banned. I also post conversations between me and creeps on the app to warn others yet I get reported for bullying and harassment when I’m the one being harassed. Too many people are getting banned for the wrong reasons. Mainly girls too.

First of all, besides just piercings, please add new jewelry such as necklaces (especially one with a cross on it, because so many people around the world, including me, are Christians, and we worship God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit) and bracelets, there can’t just be random face piercings! Second, please add braces and misaligned teeth (especially tooth gaps) because there are especially so many middle schoolers who have braces, and there are people who have misaligned teeth. Third, why don’t you add some new hairstyles, especially medium-length hairstyles because a lot of girls cannot even find their real hairstyles on your own app, I mean, there aren’t enough options, and there needs to be a wider variety of hairstyles because so many people have downloaded your own app. Fourth, please add some new clothing, especially clothing from Vineyard Vines, Lululemon, Lilly Pulitzer, Southern Marsh, Simply Southern, etc., also the 4th of July was a month ago, and y’all were supposed to add American-themed options for our Bitmojis, but y’all did not listen to us because I bet y’all just couldn’t get over with Pride Month because you think that there are way more genders than just male and female, whereas there are only two genders created by God, and y’all need to add some more flannel shirts, along with sports jerseys (Football, basketball, baseball, softball, cheerleader outfits, etc.) more suits for guys & more dresses for girls (especially whenever they have homecoming, winter formals, or even prom), and add some swimsuits/bathing suits, plus there’s more variety out in the world of fashion than just Black Lives Matter BS, especially clothing, plus BLM and Antifa are corrupt organizations that are about to become a thing of the past, y’all need to admit that there’s many preppy people all over the world! Fifth, there are only just 3 options for lips, why not add some more options, even just 6 options is more than just 3, also, why don’t y’all add some abs for our Bitmojis because so many people hit the gym all the time, add some more body types like pregnant women, Cellulite (which is very common in women), etc. because there are more than just 6 body types in the world, and why don’t y’all add some muscles to our Bitmojis, y’all can’t have just weak Bitmojis, also why not add some birth marks so that we can know what age the Bitmoji is! Sixth and final, on many stickers celebrating Holidays, y’all don’t even include Christian Stickers like for example, many people say “Merry Christmas” & admit that Jesus Christ was born on Christmas Day, but y’all just say “Happy Holidays” & only care about a sticker with presents under the tree just because y’all don’t even care about God like we do, y’all care so much about Muslim Holidays, Pride Month, Jewish Holidays, so many other religions and even irreligious/atheist/agnostic stickers, so why not add some Christian Bitmoji stickers, also for Easter, the only Easter-related thing y’all care about is the Easter Bunny who gives you candy, whereas Easter was the Resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and the lack of Christian-themed Bitmoji Stickers make a lot of Christians really mad and angry, including me!\n\nI hope y’all understand what I just said, now read this review, and then improve on your customization options, you have made so many people including me angry, Bitmoji!\n\n## Comment ID ilp8uh9 with +8 score by [(p4stelisqt, Reddit, 2022-08-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitmoji/comments/wf9nys/important_message_to_bitmojisnap_inc/ilp8uh9/) (in reply to ID wf9nys):\nbro what 💀\n\n## Comment ID iz8fyil with +9 score by [(deletus_my_fetus, Reddit, 2022-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitmoji/comments/wf9nys/important_message_to_bitmojisnap_inc/iz8fyil/) (in reply to ID wf9nys):\nI agree that there should be more options for customization…\n\nBut why are you coming at it from the angle of “I’m Christian, so you must do everything exactly how I want it 😡”.

Come back to the office (let's say 3 days a week).  The young workers will be happy as it gets them access to an in-person community.  When i started out, being in a live team environment was incredibly useful for learning. Those going into the office will have an advantage in accelerating their career and over time others will opt in to returning to the office to compete or they fade away. \n\n2. Companies embrace remote working and realize that there are huge cost benefits in hiring from LCOL locations,  eventually moving most remote positions off shore.\n\nNext year is going to be a difficult economic year.

Flexible hours and wfh days (though generally not full hybrid) were a thing long before COVID. No one’s checking badge logs or yelling at you if you get in at 9:02am. \n\nSo I think a lot of companies are that are going hybrid are really declaring a baseline policy and the reality will vary for individuals. One thing it does is set expectations that you do have to by physically present near an office, vs full remote where you could base in more places. \n\nI interviewed at a small quant hedge fund a while back and talked to someone pretty senior. They had a hybrid policy and he joked that he typically saw the engineers maybe once a week (in a way that he did not have any issue with that).

      "# Post ID 581s3x: Snap Inc. Stock with +52 score by [(whichtochooz, Reddit, 2016-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/581s3x/snap_inc_stock/)\nHello. I have incredible offers from Snap Inc. and Facebook, but I was wondering what the opinions are here. Snap is offering me a boat-load of RSUs (to the liking of ~$450k - backloaded at 10/20/30/40) with a very high salary to boot ($120,350). Facebook's total comp at the current stock price is ~$185k.\n\nMy decision at this point is primarily based on money. I have a Master's in AI, and the teams I'll be joining at both companies are both equally interesting to me. However, I'm having trouble determining how to value Snap's stock. There are several news articles claiming they plan on an IPO in March 2017 at $25 billion. The RSU's they're offering are based on the current valuation of ~16-18 billion, so I could potentially see closer to ~$800k in stock from Snap.\n\nNeedless to say, I'm very excited about potentially being able to acquire so much money in such a short period of time, but I'm having trouble finding information online about pre-IPO stock and what it's worth (assuming the company plans to IPO very soon).\n\n\n## Comment ID d8wsbfn with +41 score by [(temp20312414, Reddit, 2016-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/581s3x/snap_inc_stock/d8wsbfn/) (in reply to ID 581s3x):\nCongrats on your offers! One thing to remember is that Snap actually issues the stock the month that you join, so if you're joining after it ipos, you'll be receiving that much money. But otherwise, there will be a lot of fluctuation once it ipos so you could see its valuation between $20-30 billion. Also, there is not guarantee of it ipoing even though they have recently filed for ipo. If the market suddenly tanks then they will likely pull out of the filing. It seems like the market is doing decently right now so most likely this won't be an issue. If I were you and solely balancing the scales on money, then I would go to snap as you could be making between 500k-1million on the stock in 4 years.\n\n### Comment ID d8x379x with +17 score by [(secretWolfMan, Reddit, 2016-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/581s3x/snap_inc_stock/d8x379x/) (in reply to ID d8wsbfn):\nAgree.

How likely is FB compared to Snapchat (with backloaded stock) to give OP a raise? OP is taking a chance on the company actually IPOing. OP is handcuffed to the company for 4 years.

Snapchat's location in Santa Monica is much nicer than Facebook's in Menlo Park.  There are houses in Los Angeles you could buy in your first year.  This would be pretty much impossible in Menlo Park or anywhere else in the Peninsula.  You could buy in Union City or San Leandro but the quality of life is far better in Los Angeles.\n\nUnlike most \"unicorns\", Snapchat is actually likely to IPO.  I think the offers are equivalent once you price in the risk of a drop in stock value once Snap Inc's financials are exposed to the world.\n\nAnother upside is being part of an engineering team in a company that is up and coming.\n\nBecause you didn't mention it, I assume you don't have kids.

Unless it does IPO, those RSU's aren't worth much. Also, take into account that even though it IPO's at 25 billion valuation, your stock options could potentially lose a lot of value by the time they vest (think Twitter). Now, I can't say much about Snap because until they IPO, there is no knowledge about what its financial state really looks like. Facebook on the other hand, is a very solid company, and that stock is not going lower any time soon.\n\n## Comment ID d8ww8gv with +4 score by [(dynapro, Reddit, 2016-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/581s3x/snap_inc_stock/d8ww8gv/) (in reply to ID 581s3x):\nKeep in mind 4 years is a pretty long time frame in tech, and a lot of things can change in that time. The Snap offer is higher risk and higher reward, but I think in this case, the reward justifies the risk.

They could IPO and your stock could tank when everyone realizes the idea is stupid and shouldn't be worth that much.\n\nOr, the founders, being the well-known pricks that they are, could pull a Zynga and dilute the values of your shares or straight up take them back.

      "# Post ID 10ji8xs: Snap Camera Shutdown Solution with +65 score by [(jakuu, Reddit, 2023-01-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/10ji8xs/snap_camera_shutdown_solution/)\nAs you may or may not be aware, on Jan 25th, the Snap Camera app is being shut down. Many content creators use this software to use snap lenses on their stream and have fun ways for users to activate them with cheers, channel points, and more. \n\nWhile there have been many solutions posted on how to prevent yourself from being affected, all the current solutions have you blocking the servers and have you crossing your fingers that the local cache of your lenses doesn't expire. These solutions also prevent you from finding and adding new lenses.\n\nI've been working on a solution that helps preserve these lenses and still allows you to use the Snap Camera app without blocking any network activity. This allows you to use any of the over 100,000 lenses I've been able to back up as well if you haven't previously installed them. It also may be possible for me to add lenses after the shutdown, but that won't be able to be determined until after the shutdown.\n\nThis solution also works for both MacOS and Windows, although they have slightly different steps, they are both fairly easy to do. You can find the instructions on my GitHub at https://github.com/jaku/SnapCameraPreservation.\n\nI can try and help users set things up if they get lost and I am happy to help answer any other questions you may have on this.\n\nTLDR; Snap Camera is shutting down, if you want to use it after the shutdown follow the instructions at https://github.com/jaku/SnapCameraPreservation.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID j5l04os with +7 score by [(thatdudewillyd, Reddit, 2023-01-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/10ji8xs/snap_camera_shutdown_solution/j5l04os/) (in reply to ID 10ji8xs):\nNice!

Marketing. Training. Operationalization/implementation. Localization.\n\nIt’s also creates a lot of noise and potential for crossover. At a high level project prioritization becomes way more difficult, especially if each PM doesn’t have their exclusive team of engineers and are each relying on microservice teams.\n\nUltimately, that many PMs for one consumer product introduces a ton of overhead. If they hired a bunch of PMs in the past without considering that need, it means that they have a hard time supporting the features and products released. If they can’t support those products or features, they have 2 choices= grow the rest of the teams to be able to support (which would come with more spending and more problems) or cut the team, since the company isn’t able to capitalize on the features and Products being released anyways.\n\nIn this economy, every company is leaning towards cuts over growth and trying to get to positive cash flow so that they don’t have to rely on really high interest rate credit.\n\n#### Comment ID k8tfwxy with +26 score by [(Disallowed_username, Reddit, 2023-11-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17swegy/anyone_from_snap_knows_the_real_reason_20_pms/k8tfwxy/) (in reply to ID k8ssusj):\nI can believe it.

We hired so many PMs that we have very thin teams and PMs minding very small parts of the product. Realistically there is just so much work to go around and all those folks end up making up work to look busy and drag operational velocity way down.

The article says that he shaped the engineering culture, so whoever takes over maybe has a different vision with different structures and less PMs. The ratio of engineers to PMs in an org is based solely on the taste of the execs.\n\n2: they are loosing more money than before and the current environment is not too tolerant for that. PMs are also super expensive. \n\n3: this not in the article but I think they want to figure out what's next and until there is a clear vision, they want to be leaner. \n\nI'm also not so sure if we ever going to find out the real reason.

Loosely speaking R&D to me is the initial creation of turning ideas to prototypes and getting it to generally work in the wild. \n\nPMs and product go way past that. In theory each ‘product’ goes thru stages of evolution from inception to evolving to peak relevance and ability to add value to users to eventually retiring it when no longer useful. Every step of its life requires research to ensure it evolves to something valuable, then downgraded appropriately for something else. \n\nSo as long as the product is relevant and there is a perception that there is more room to advance it, PMs can be potentially employable.\n\n#### Comment ID k8uxk6t with +1 score by [(buddyholly27, Reddit, 2023-11-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17swegy/anyone_from_snap_knows_the_real_reason_20_pms/k8uxk6t/) (in reply to ID k8u28p2):\nThey mean product development not greenfield research btw\n\n### Comment ID k8vdzc5 with +2 score by [(dementeddigital2, Reddit, 2023-11-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17swegy/anyone_from_snap_knows_the_real_reason_20_pms/k8vdzc5/) (in reply to ID k8sqoga):\nAnd then you get creamed when market conditions change.

However, it must be acknowledged that the product and technology have significant flaws. Instead of investing in improving the advertising platform and rectifying these issues, which are pivotal in driving 95% of the company's revenue, the CEO prioritises funding a small yellow drone with a mere two-minute battery life. Additionally, Snap creators are compensated more generously than those on other platforms, possibly to create a false sense of community or activity.",

Snapchat — Snap Inc.’s multimedia messaging platform — resonates strongly with teens and will provide an additional avenue for the campaign to bring important online safety information to this community directly.\n\n“The dangerous reality is that as safety protocols are put in place to protect children online, predators are already working to find ways around them,” said DHS Cyber Crimes Center Deputy Assistant Director Mike Prado. “Collaborative tools, like the one we are announcing today, help empower teens and young people with the information they need to stay one step ahead.”\n\nThe Snapchat Lens is designed to engage teens through a fun and interactive quiz format that poses true-false questions about online safety and how to prevent potential online harms. Snapchatters will be able to apply real-time effects and animations to their videos, transforming the learning experience into an entertaining adventure.\n\nBy leveraging Snapchat’s interactive features, the Know2Protect campaign aims to create memorable experiences that promote awareness of online risks.\n\n“Snap is honored to be a founding member of Know2Protect — an important initiative to educate teens and adults about online child exploitation,” said Snap Inc.’s Global Head of Platform Security Jacqueline Beauchere. “We are excited to see the launch of this engaging Lens on our platform, which will continue to amplify the campaign's message across the country.”\n\nIn addition to the Know2Protect lens, Snap Inc. amplified the campaign’s reach through donated paid media, by promoting the lens on Snapchat. The lens will also be promoted on Know2Protect’s owned social media channels. Additionally, Snap is conducting ongoing research with teens aged 13 to 17 and young adults aged 18 to 24 in the United States about the various dimensions of child sexual exploitation and abuse online, which will help to further inform the campaign.\n\n“The Know2Protect Snapchat Lens equips teens with important information about online safety in an interactive way. We encourage parents and trusted adults to also check it out. This feature can jumpstart sometimes difficult but necessary conversations with teens about online safety,” said Know2Protect Campaign Director Kate Kennedy.\n\nTo access the free Know2Protect Snapchat Lens:\n\nOpen the Lens Explorer in Snapchat.\n\nUse the search icon when the carousel is active and type in Know2Protect.\n\nSwipe on the carousel and tap the Know2Protect lens.\n\nFor more information visit https://help.snapchat.com, Know2Protect.gov or @Know2Protect on Instagram, Facebook and X.",

I was permanently locked out of my account and I appealed it and I have sent messages and itâs not like you get to talk to a person itâs all automated messages. So I created a new snap using a different number that snap lasted 3 weeks and then boom permanently locked. I had created a total of 5 snapchats within a months time and they were all permanently banned and all for the same reason (sexual content with a minor) I can assure you none of that was on my snap at all. So the same someone had to just keep reporting my accounts and snap just allowed it. Let me back in my original snap account I want my memories and conversations back! It says I can request a copy of my data but I try doing that and it says to log in but I canât login being permanently locked out. Now they banned my phone but Iâm due for an upgrade anyways. But snap is my go to for talking more so than texting. So Snapchat if youâre reading this FIX YOUR PROBLEMS AND GIVE ME MY ACCOUNT BACK!!!\n\nLydia_987123 ,\n\nSnapchat + should add the feature of decreasing snapscore\n\nI think that a snapchat + should have an option to decrease your snap score. This should happen because I know that a lot of people would like to decrease their snap score and this should be an option because there is a snap score increasing option. Personally, I have many friends that would like if snapchat added a snap score decrease to their snapchat + options and they would also buy snapchat + just for that reason. I also agree that there should be an option to decrease your snap score because I would definitely buy snapchat + for that reason and so would many others. Also, if snapchat + already had an option to increase your snap score, it only makes sense that they would add a snap score decrease. This is because if people are already changing their snap score by making it higher through snapchat +, then they should be able to make it lower. Some ways that this could happen that the snap score could decrease by either 75%, 50%, or 25%. Also, they they could also make a way where you can take away 100,000 snap score or 200,000 snap score but only if you have that much snap score or else it wouldnât work. I feel like with a new snap score decreasing option, this would definitely make the app better because this would make people want to use it more frequently without worry of their snap score getting too high. Other than this, I think that snapchat is a really good app and I use it all the time!",

Snap is all about empowering people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together.

      "# [New Mexico’s attorney general files a suit saying Snapchat allows child sexual extortion by BARBARA ORTUTAY, the internet twitter mailto, apnews.com, barbara-ortutay on 2024-09-05](https://apnews.com/article/new-mexico-snapchat-attorney-general-sextortion-teens-1a1c4c856a24d15631f26bb69e0f4c74)\nAP Technology Writer (AP) — New Mexico’s attorney general has filed a lawsuit against the company behind Snapchat, alleging that site’s design and policies foster the sharing of child sexual abuse material and facilitate child sexual exploitation.\n\nAttorney General Raúl Torrez filed the lawsuit against Snap Inc. Thursday in state court in Santa Fe. In addition to sexual abuse, the lawsuit claims the company also openly promotes child trafficking, drugs and guns.\n\nLast December, Torrez filed a similar lawsuit against Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, saying it allows predators to trade child sexual abuse material and solicit minors for sex on its platforms. That suit is still pending.\n\nSnap’s “harmful design features create an environment where predators can easily target children through sextortion schemes and other forms of sexual abuse,” Torrez said in a statement. Sexual extortion, or sextortion, involves persuading a person to send explicit photos online and then threatening to make the images public unless the victim pays money or engages in sexual favors.\n\n“Snap has misled users into believing that photos and videos sent on their platform will disappear, but predators can permanently capture this content and they have created a virtual yearbook of child sexual images that are traded, sold, and stored indefinitely,” Torrez said.\n\nIn a statement, Snap said it shares Torrez’s and the public’s concerns about the online safety of young people.\n\n“We understand that online threats continue to evolve and we will continue to work diligently to address these critical issues,” the company based in Santa Monica, California, said. “We have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in our trust and safety teams over the past several years, and designed our service to promote online safety by moderating content and enabling direct messaging with close friends and family.”\n\nAccording to the complaint, minors report having more online sexual interactions on Snapchat than any other platform, and more sex trafficking victims are recruited on Snapchat than on any other platform.\n\nPrior to the lawsuit, New Mexico conducted a monthslong undercover investigation into child sexual abuse images on Snapchat. According to Torrez’s statement, the investigation revealed a “vast network of dark web sites dedicated to sharing stolen, non-consensual sexual images from Snap,” finding more than 10,000 records related to Snap and child sexual abuse material in the last year. This included information related to minors younger than 13 being sexually assaulted.\n\nAs part of the undercover investigation, the New Mexico department of justice set up a decoy Snapchat account for a 14-year-old named Heather, who found and exchanged messages with accounts with names like “child.rape” and “pedo_lover10.”\n\nSnapchat, the lawsuit alleges, “was by far the largest source of images and videos among the dark web sites investigated.” Investigators also found Snapchat accounts that openly circulated and sold child abuse images directly on the platform.",

      "# [I Was Wrong About Snap Stock in 2022. Here's How I See It Now. by Will Healy, www.facebook.com on 2024-09-01](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/01/i-wrong-snap-stock-2022-heres-how-i-see-it-now/)\nWhen it comes to investing mistakes, one of the costliest was underestimating the severity of the 2022 bear market. That led me to make bad bullish calls on some stocks that had lost more than half their value -- and kept falling.\n\nOne of those stocks was Snap, Inc. (SNAP -1.03%). It had lost more than half of its value, and when it came to Snap stock in the next five years, I speculated that it would beat the S&P 500. Unfortunately, nearly 2.5 years later, the Snapchat parent has lost approximately 65% of its value since that time, making it unlikely to beat the market by April 2027.\n\nNonetheless, this lousy call on the social media stock offers lessons on investing in general, and on investing in Snap stock if I choose to do so.\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\nAs for what went wrong, probably the biggest mistake was underestimating the severity of the 2022 bear market. When I made this call in April 2022, stocks were trending downward, but the belief seemed to be that it was a healthy pullback after a massive bull run in 2021. This led investors like myself to make calls on stocks down more than 50% and, unfortunately, on track to lose more.\n\nAdmittedly, investors can earn huge returns on big moves. However, in another sense, it makes investing more difficult amid the rising volatility.\n\nAs for Snap stock at the time, I thought it had turned a corner. After the industry behemoth Meta Platforms (META 0.88%) profited from copying Snap's innovations, Snap learned to better leverage the power of advertising.\n\nAdditionally, Snap was gaining an increasing following with people over 25 years old, a necessary demographic to capture if it wanted to grow. Such improvements made me feel I could ignore ongoing losses and an approximate price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 12.\n\nUnfortunately, the 2022 bear market also led to a decline in advertising revenue. Since ad giants like Google's parent Alphabet reported only single-digit increases in ad revenue at the time, it was unlikely that Snap would prosper in that environment, and indeed, the stock fell further.\n\nSnap stock going forward\n\nThe question now is whether I would speculate that Snap stock will beat the market over the next five years beginning today. The truth is, I would not make such a claim now, and while such a surge is not impossible, it looks increasingly unlikely.\n\nSnap stock continued falling in 2022, and by the low point of the bear market in late 2022, it had reached a price comparable to where it trades today.\n\nDespite Snap's lower price, I hesitate to make a bullish call, since its net losses continue to this day. Also, its $2.4 billion in revenue for the first half of 2024 is not far above the $2.2 billion in revenue it earned at the same point in 2022.\n\nConsidering the company's relatively small market cap of $15 billion, it should grow more easily than Meta, which now claims a $1.3 trillion market cap. However, Meta grew its revenue 35% over the same two-year timeframe, compared to just 12% for Snap. That's a factor that's likely to deter growth investors from buying the stock.\n\nMoreover, Snap should have a valuation edge, since its P/S ratio of 3 is close to all-time lows and far below Meta at 9 times sales. Nonetheless, the slower revenue growth and ongoing losses appear to negate that advantage.\n\nLessons on my Snap stock misstep\n\nUltimately, the wrong call I made on Snap and other stocks has changed how I look at investing in bull markets that are possibly turning negative. Probably the biggest lesson is that investors never know when a bottom will come. While I did not technically call a bottom on Snap in April 2022, I thought it was much closer than it actually was.\n\nSecond, I did not give enough thought to how Snap might perform in a severe downturn. I knew it had virtually no chance of unseating Meta in the social media space. Thus, I should have known it would see the negative effects of a downturn much faster and recover more slowly when conditions finally improved.\n\nIn fact, Snap's stock price has yet to recover. For that and other reasons, I do not think it will beat the market over the next five years. Until it can accelerate its revenue growth, investors are likely best off taking speculative positions in this stock, if they choose to buy at all.",

      "# [Niantic and Snap Inc.: Transforming Our Reality with AR Glasses](https://nianticlabs.com/news/niantic-snap-partnership)\nPeridot: Bringing Virtual Pets to Life\n\nPeridot Beyond is Niantic’s first game built for true outdoor-friendly augmented reality glasses. This experience is a reimagined version of our AR pet simulation game, specifically designed for Spectacles, and will be available on Spectacles in the US on the day of launch. Attendees at the Snap Partner Summit will be among the first to experience the whimsical world of Peridot through Spectacles.\n\nWith your Dots by your side, you’ll be able to embark on outdoor adventures—pet them up close, explore with them to discover food, and play catch. It’s an engaging experience that fosters connection, with new features to come, like the ability for multiple players to interact with their Dots together in real life.\n\nPeridot continues to delight users across all its formats, and you can read more about it here.\n\nScaniverse: Sharing Your World in 3D\n\nWith the recent release of Niantic Scaniverse 4 for iOS, we’ve invited the world to scan and share their world in 3D on a global map. Using a technology called Gaussian splatting, these 3D pictures are impressively realistic, and you can process the whole image right on your phone without limits, for free.\n\nNow, users can import these images—they’re called splats—straight from their phones into Lens Studio, allowing any place, moment, or memory captured to be experienced through the Spectacles. This integration opens up new possibilities for creators to transform the way we see and interact with the world in 3D, making everyday environments and objects more interactive and accessible through augmented reality.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThis is an incredibly exciting time for AR, with huge strides being made toward a future where outdoor AR glasses enable us to stop looking down at our phones and start looking up to better appreciate our beautiful world! To all the brilliant minds in the developer community: the canvas is yours."
