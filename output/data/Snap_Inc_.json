      "# [More Friends, More Love, More Lenses](https://ar.snap.com/blog/internationalfriendshipday)\nToday is the International Day of Friendship, established in 2011 by the UN General Assembly, “with the idea that friendship between peoples, countries, cultures and individuals can inspire peace efforts and build bridges between communities”. On Snapchat, every day can be a celebration of friendship and community. Snapchatters communicate with pictures of themselves or of what they’re doing, and a lot of the time, Lenses are a part of that. With the ability to personalize Snapchat Lenses with the dynamic Friends API, we have seen an abundance of funny and creative Lenses featuring beloved Bitmoji avatars. So we have added even more custom components and other updates that help you create these inherently personal Lenses featuring your friends and family, and your Bitmoji. Let’s take a look at the new features and custom components we added to the Asset Library recently.\n\nThe Friends Carousel allows you to easily feature a carousel-view of the Snapchatter’s friends. This way, a Snapchatter can swipe through Bitmoji avatars to choose a friend that best suits the Lens. We also added the UI Carousel custom component, which is a generic version of the same UI shown here.\n\nWith an update to the Friends component, you can make sure that when a Snapchatter replies with the Lens in a chat, the featured Bitmoji avatars in the Lens are specific to the friend they’re talking to. Talk about relevant! Bitmoji avatars can also render shadows now too. And when you’re building a Lens with the Friends API, instead of seeing a default Bitmoji avatar in the preview screen of Lens Studio, you’ll now see your own avatar's stickers, as long as you’re logged in. Be sure to download the latest Lens Studio release for all the updates.\n\nThere’s so many opportunities to make friendship-focused Lenses that promote communication and love between friends on Snapchat. On International Friendship Day, we hope you feel inspired to tell your friends how much they mean to you! Make your own or try sending these 🤗",

Come back to the office (let's say 3 days a week).  The young workers will be happy as it gets them access to an in-person community.  When i started out, being in a live team environment was incredibly useful for learning. Those going into the office will have an advantage in accelerating their career and over time others will opt in to returning to the office to compete or they fade away. \n\n2. Companies embrace remote working and realize that there are huge cost benefits in hiring from LCOL locations,  eventually moving most remote positions off shore.\n\nNext year is going to be a difficult economic year.

Flexible hours and wfh days (though generally not full hybrid) were a thing long before COVID. No one’s checking badge logs or yelling at you if you get in at 9:02am. \n\nSo I think a lot of companies are that are going hybrid are really declaring a baseline policy and the reality will vary for individuals. One thing it does is set expectations that you do have to by physically present near an office, vs full remote where you could base in more places. \n\nI interviewed at a small quant hedge fund a while back and talked to someone pretty senior. They had a hybrid policy and he joked that he typically saw the engineers maybe once a week (in a way that he did not have any issue with that). I suspect we’ll see that kind of attitude a lot of places.\n\n#### Comment ID iyblz7v with +7 score by [(closethegatealittle, Reddit, 2022-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z816qv/snap_requiring_employees_to_work_from_office_80/iyblz7v/) (in reply to ID iyazu57):\n>No one’s checking badge logs or yelling at you if you get in at 9:02am.\n\nI know a couple of companies that are threatening action against employees if they don't go into the office by pulling badge reports and doing random walkthroughs.

From the few connections I have, they say the work/life balance is not great. My recruiter didn’t know basic technical concepts that a recruiter should know like the stack they use for mobile development. He sold the program to me as a “fun experience” and told me that interns have created features used on the app (like the bitmoji that sits at the bottom of your chats) but for the most part you just work on an intern project for “experience”.\n\nWhen interviewing, they asked me if I had any other offers and I said yes, and then my interviewer tried to ask me specific monetary details about my offers (which I declined to share and they respected, but that was a bit odd). I also asked what the hours looked like for their developers (to know if overtime was a possibility) and my interviewer just emphasized that I basically couldn’t leave until my job was done. I’m assuming that doesn’t matter for interns since they just work on a side project, but if you are interning to possibly get a full-time offer, it sounds like they overwork their employees.\n\nIts up to you and your experience interviewing, but I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.\n\n## Comment ID f6mtx9o with +3 score by [(menpri, Reddit, 2019-11-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dra7ey/internship_at_snap_inc/f6mtx9o/) (in reply to ID dra7ey):\nI interned there and really liked it.

      "# Post ID 85zgyl: New grads, don't come to SNAP with +711 score by [(None, Reddit, 2018-03-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/85zgyl/new_grads_dont_come_to_snap/)\nI was a new grad joined Snap for a while. I am not happy after joining Snap. Sitting in office today, I thought a lot of things.\n\nI graduated from pretty good universities. Almost all my friends and classmates chose FB and Google when graduating. We all have many other offers and compete our offers, many of my Google friends got 250-325 RSU as new grad, many of my FB friends got 160k to 220k RSU and 100k sign-on bonus. One of my friends chose MSFT, he like relaxing life, his package is 115K base and 150K RSU and espp (Buy company stock with discount). Now, their stocks value are all greater than 250K. Of course, they all have cash bonus from 10% to 20%. And some of them have already been promoted. \n\nWhen I graduated I got many offers, like SNAP, FB, Google, MSFT and have many upcoming on-site interviews like Uber and Amazon, finally I choose SNAP and reject all others since I think it is a s tart-up and I can take on many interesting projects and I can get promotion quickly and even is really COOL right. OK, that's where the nightmare began, the worst decision in my life so far.\n\nCompared with my friends in other company, how about me ? The poor guy who chose SNAP.\n\nWorking hard everyday. on-call every day. Finish many Jira tickets everyday. Bringing my laptop even on-vacation or in movie theater. No cash bonus. No promotion. They keep saying you will get promotion next time but they fail me everytime.\n\nHow about other new grads in this company ? Some experienced endless re-org, project is killed halfway over and over again; Some are working hard, 9 to 9, arriving company at 9 am and leaving at 9 pm; Some are doing really great job but all credits are taken by seniors, some seniors assign them many tasks and email the team 'Hey I introduce you a very powerful thing that I implemented'. Some want to change team but director D***d didn't allow and got piped. Unfortunately many of them are laid off, the 9-9 guy who is working hard everyday is laid off. New grad who joined 1 month ago is laid off. And many many many many............\n\nIt is SNAP which we choose as our first full-time company. We believe you, we trust you, we love you so we choose you. But you lay off so many good new grads, some are even in their 1st, 2nd month and some are waiting for H1B lottery.\n\nOur best java expert is also laid off, they are not the lowest performance guys, at least many of them are good, super good.\n\nNew grads, don't come. \n\n## Comment ID dw1ajt7 with +106 score by [(Toasted_FlapJacks, Reddit, 2018-03-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/85zgyl/new_grads_dont_come_to_snap/dw1ajt7/) (in reply to ID 85zgyl):\nDamn I heard things had taken a turn, but I didn't imagine it to be this bad.

The yellow ghost app that every millennial uses despite the app has more bugs than features and uses a 1 MP pictures on Android. \n\nHonestly the app isn't worth using outside of snapmap. The only real reason to use it is because other people do. Instagram or any messenger app does almost everything snapchat can but better. \n\nIt's also not worth investing in. They'll likely never be profitable and have no real unique way to attract ads. \n\nAnd also apparently not worth working at.

It is time to look for opportunities elsewhere.\n\n## Comment ID dw1bt0p with +262 score by [(newasianinsf, Reddit, 2018-03-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/85zgyl/new_grads_dont_come_to_snap/dw1bt0p/) (in reply to ID 85zgyl):\nThe numbers are bullshit, as an FYI everyone.\n\n### Comment ID dw1cml2 with +143 score by [(None, Reddit, 2018-03-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/85zgyl/new_grads_dont_come_to_snap/dw1cml2/) (in reply to ID dw1bt0p):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID dw1i23m with +17 score by [(None, Reddit, 2018-03-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/85zgyl/new_grads_dont_come_to_snap/dw1i23m/) (in reply to ID dw1cml2):\nThe numbers are accurate, RSUs are talked about as a sum total of what you can expect over 4 years, so 250k/4 years is a fairly average new grad RSU grant.

I would encourage every person out there to treat their employer as if this is how their employer will behave until you see solid evidence first-hand that it's not.\n\nPromotions and raises are partially based on competence, but often only so far as a company most likely won't pay you more than the amount of value they think you provide.

Yes, people without perfect English can get those high paying offers in America. Yes, people who aren't born in an English speaking country can get those offers.

I feel like a lot of my enjoyment on the app is when I see the people who view my story, and without that honestly I think I’m just gonna stop using this app altogether and just stick to instagram so… good job, I guess",

However, it must be acknowledged that the product and technology have significant flaws. Instead of investing in improving the advertising platform and rectifying these issues, which are pivotal in driving 95% of the company's revenue, the CEO prioritises funding a small yellow drone with a mere two-minute battery life. Additionally, Snap creators are compensated more generously than those on other platforms, possibly to create a false sense of community or activity.",

However, it must be acknowledged that the product and technology have significant flaws. Instead of investing in improving the advertising platform and rectifying these issues, which are pivotal in driving 95% of the company's revenue, the CEO prioritises funding a small yellow drone with a mere two-minute battery life.

      "# [Snapchat Privacy](https://values.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy)\nThis section provides you with details on what information we collect. We’ve organized this in a few categories: information you provide to us, information we generate based on your use of our Services, and information we receive from others. Sometimes, we may also collect additional information, with your permission.\n\nWhen you use our Services, such as Snapchat, we collect information you provide to us, generate information when you use our Services, and in some cases receive data from others. Let’s break these down in more detail.\n\nInformation You Provide\n\nMany of our Services require you to set up an account. To do this, we ask you to provide us with account details (information about you, like your name, username, email address, birthday, and phone number). When you set up your profile, you’ll also provide us with profile details (like your Bitmoji and profile picture). If you use our commerce products to buy something, like those latest sneakers, we may ask you for payment and related information (like your physical address, so we can ship the product to you, payment information, so we can process the payment, and transaction history).\n\nOf course, you’ll also provide us with the information you send through or save within our Services. We consider some of this information to be private content and communications (like Snaps and Chats with friends, My Story set to Friends, Private Stories, voice and video calls, and content that is saved in My Eyes Only). On the other end of the spectrum, some of the information you send through or save within our Services may be public content that is accessible to everyone (such as Public Story content, including My Story set to Everyone, Shared Stories, and Community Stories, Spotlight or Snap Map submissions, and Public Profile information). Keep in mind that Snapchatters who view your Snaps, Chats, and any other content, can always screenshot that content, save it, or copy it outside the Snapchat app. So please don’t send messages or share content that you wouldn’t want someone to save or share.\n\nLastly, when you contact Support (content and communications shared with Support) or our Safety team, or communicate with us in any other way, including through our research efforts (like responses to surveys, consumer panels, or other research questions) we’ll collect whatever information you provide or that we need to resolve your question.\n\nInformation We Generate When You Use Our Services\n\nWhen you use our Services, we collect information about which of those Services you’ve used and how you’ve used them. This helps us better understand the way our community uses our Services so that we can make improvements.\n\nThis includes usage information (information about how you interact with our Services — for example, which Lenses you view and apply, Stories you watch, and how often you communicate with other Snapchatters) and content information (information about content you create or provide, your engagement with the camera and creative tools, your interactions with My AI, and metadata — for example, information about the content itself like the date and time it was posted and who viewed it). Content information includes information based on the content of the image, video, or audio — so if you post a Spotlight of a basketball game, we may use that information to show you more content on Spotlight about basketball.\n\nThis also includes device information (such as your hardware or software, operating system, device memory, advertising identifiers, apps installed, browser type, information from device sensors that measure the motion of your device or compasses and microphones, including whether you have headphones connected, and information about your wireless and mobile connections), location information (IP address), information collected by cookies and similar technologies, depending on your settings, (cookies, web beacons (small graphic data that recognize user activity, such as if and how often a user has visited a website), web storage, unique advertising identifiers), and log information (such as details about how you’ve used our Services, access times, pages viewed, IP address, and unique identifiers like cookies).\n\nIf you’ve explicitly granted device-level permissions, device information may also include information about your device phonebook (contacts and related information), images and other information from your device’s camera, photos, and microphone (like the ability to take photos, videos, view stored photos and videos, and access the microphone to record audio while recording video), and location information (precise location through methods like GPS signals).\n\nData We Receive From Others\n\nThe last category of data we collect is information about you that we may receive from others, such as other users, our affiliates, and third parties. This includes linked third-party service data (information we get when you link your Snapchat account to another service), data from advertisers (information from advertisers, app developers, publishers, and other third parties to help target or measure the performance of ads), contact info from other Snapchatters or third parties (if another Snapchatter uploads their contact list which includes your information, we may combine that with other information we have about you to better understand who you may want to communicate with. Or, if you provide us with your contact information, we may use that to determine if we can communicate with you in other ways, like SMS, email, or other messaging services), and data relating to potential violations of our Terms (we may receive information from third parties, including website publishers, social network providers, law enforcement, and others, about potential violators of our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines).\n\nOther Information, With Your Permission\n\nAdditionally, there may be instances when you interact with our Services that we will ask your permission to collect additional information. For example, before accessing your device’s camera roll or Contact Book.\n\nThis section explains how we use the information we collect. Among other things, we use the information we collect to provide you with personalized products and Services that we work hard to build and improve. Below, we walk through each purpose for which we use information in detail. If you’d like to see a mapping of the data we collect with the purposes for which we collect it, we have a table here.\n\nKeep Things Up & Running (i.e., operate, deliver, and maintain our Services)\n\nWe use the information we collect in order to operate, deliver, and maintain our Services. For example, by delivering a Snap you want to send to a friend or, if you share your location on Snap Map, to show you suggestions like places you might like in your neighborhood, content others have posted to the Map, or your friends if they’re sharing their location with you. We also use some of your information to help keep our products up to date, for example to make sure that our Services work with the latest operating systems and devices.\n\nPersonalize Your Experience & Give Context\n\nWe offer personalized Services to Snapchatters. One of the ways we do this is by showing you content that is relevant to you or we think you may enjoy based on the information you share with us. To do so, we use information about you across different areas of the Services in order to add context to your Snapchat experience. For example, we automatically tag content with labels based on the content, your location, or the time of day. So if there's a dog in the photo, it may be searchable in Memories by the term “dog,” show up on the Map at the location where you created the Memory, and inform us that you’re into dogs so we can surface you fun dog videos and dog food ads in other parts of our Services, such as Spotlight.\n\nPersonalization can also help with suggesting friends or recommending a new friend to send a Snap to based on who you Snap with the most. We may show recommended places on the Snap Map, generate stickers, or even generate Snaps and other content using AI to share with friends, infer your interests based on your content or activity, or customize the content we show you, including ads. For example, if you watch barista content on Spotlight, talk to My AI about your favorite espresso machine, or save a lot of coffee-related Snaps in your Memories, we may highlight coffee shops on the Snap Map when you visit a new city or show you content about coffee that you may find interesting or relevant. Or, if you interact with a lot of music venues we may use that to show you ads for upcoming shows in town. Personalization also includes tailoring your experience based on what your friends are doing, including showing you content your friends create, like, or enjoy on Spotlight or Place recommendations that are popular with your friends.\n\nOur goal is to continuously provide you with more relevant and interesting content.\n\nFor example, if you watch a lot of sports content, but skip content with hair and makeup tips, our recommendation algorithms will prioritize sports, but not those makeup tips. You can learn more about how we understand Snapchatter preferences and rank and moderate content here.\n\nWe believe it is critical to also balance the benefits of personalization with our Snapchatters’ expectations of privacy. For example, we may automatically tag the Snaps you save to Memories based on the content within it (e.g., the Snap contained a dog), and then use that tag to personalize your experience, make recommendations, or show you ads (such as showing you Spotlight Snaps containing dogs). We do not use the private content and communications you send to your friends to personalize your experience, make recommendations, or show you ads.\n\nProvide Relevant Ads\n\nAnother way we provide a personalized Service is through the ads we show. We use your interests and preferences from the information we’ve collected to personalize, target, and measure ads. We think ads are best when they’re relevant. That’s why we try to select the right ads and show them to you at the right time. For example, if you’ve interacted with ads for video games, we will infer that you like video games, and show you similar ads, but those won’t be the only ads you see. Similar to our content strategy, we try to ensure you receive a variety of ads. We also use your information to avoid showing you ads you probably won’t be interested in. For example, if a ticketing site tells us you’ve previously bought tickets for a movie — we can stop showing you ads for it. You can learn about the different types of advertising and your choices about which ads you receive here.\n\nYou can learn more about how we collect, use, and share your information for advertising purposes here.\n\nA note about information collected by cookies and other technologies: we may use these technologies to collect information when you interact with Services we offer through one of our partners. For example, we may use information collected on an advertiser’s website to show you more relevant ads. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our Services. To learn more about how we and our partners use cookies on our Services and your choices, please check out our Cookie Policy.\n\nDevelop & Improve Features, Algorithms & Machine Learning Models\n\nOur teams are constantly coming up with new ideas for features and ways to improve our Services. In order to do this, we also develop and improve the algorithms and machine learning models (an expression of an algorithm that combs through significant amounts of data to find patterns or make predictions) that make our features and Services work, including through generative AI features (artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images, or other media, using generative models. Generative AI models learn the patterns and structure of their input training data and then generate new data that has similar characteristics). We use algorithms and machine learning models for personalization, advertising, safety and security, fairness and inclusivity, augmented reality, and to prevent abuse or other Terms of Service violations. For example, our algorithms and machine learning models take into account the conversations Snapchatters are having with My AI to improve the responses from My AI.\n\nYour information can help us decide what kind of improvements we should make, but we are always focused on privacy — and we don’t want to use more of your personal information than necessary to develop our features and models.\n\nAnalytics\n\nIn order to understand what to build or how to improve our Services, we need to understand trends and demand for our features. For example, we monitor metadata and trends about Group Chat use to help decide whether we should change parts of the feature, like the maximum size of a Group. Studying data from Snapchatters can help us see trends in the ways that people use the Services. This helps inspire us to improve Snapchat on a larger scale. We perform analytics in order to identify, monitor, and analyze trends and usage. Based on this information, we will, among other things, create information about our users to help us understand demand.\n\nResearch\n\nWe conduct research to better understand general consumer interests, trends, and how our Services are used by you and others in our community. This information, along with analytics (as we described above), helps us understand more about our community and about how our Services fit into the lives of those in our community. We also engage in research and development to develop new techniques and technologies (e.g., new machine learning models or hardware, such as Spectacles). The results of our research are sometimes used in features on Snapchat, and we sometimes publish papers about things like overall behaviors and consumer trends (which will only have aggregated data across our user base, and not contain any private information about you specifically).\n\nEnhance the Safety & Security of Our Services\n\nWe use your information to enhance the safety and security of our Services, verify Snapchatter identity, and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity. For example, we provide two-factor authentication to help protect your account and can send you email or text messages if we notice any suspicious activity. We also scan URLs sent on Snapchat to see if that webpage is potentially harmful, and can give you a warning about it.\n\nContacting You\n\nSometimes we’ll get in touch with you to promote new or existing features. This includes sending Snapchatters communications through Snapchat, email, SMS, or other messaging platforms, where permitted. For example, we may use the Snapchat app, email, SMS, or other messaging platforms to share information about our Services and promotional offers that we think may interest you.\n\nOther times, we need to communicate with you to provide information, alerts, or to send messages our users ask us to deliver at their request. This may include sending communications through Snapchat, email, SMS, or other messaging platforms, where permitted, to deliver account status updates, security alerts, and Chat or friending reminders; it may also include fulfilling our user’s request to send invites or Snapchat content to non-Snapchatters.\n\nSupport\n\nWhen you ask for help, we want to get you support as quickly as possible. In order to provide you, the Snapchatter community, and our business partners with the help needed to resolve issues with our Services, we often need to use the information we have collected to respond.\n\nEnforce Our Terms & Policies\n\nWe use the data we collect to enforce our Terms and the law. This includes enforcing, investigating, and reporting conduct that violates our Terms, policies, or the law, responding to requests from law enforcement, and complying with legal requirements. For example, when unlawful content is posted on our Services, we may need to enforce our Terms and other policies. In some cases, we may also use or share your information to cooperate with law enforcement requests, escalate safety issues to law enforcement, industry partners, or others, or comply with our legal obligations.

      "# [Snap Inc. by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2016-09-24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.)\nAmerican technology company\n\n\"Snap (company)\" redirects here. For companies with similar names, see Snap (disambiguation) § Organizations. For other uses, see Snap (disambiguation).\n\nSnap Inc. is an American technology company, founded on September 16, 2011, by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown based in Santa Monica, California. The company developed and maintains technological products and services, namely Snapchat, Spectacles, and Bitmoji. The company was named Snapchat Inc. at its inception, but it was rebranded Snap Inc. on September 24, 2016, in order to include the Spectacles product under the company name.[12] Snap is co-owned by Tencent (which holds a 45.43% stake) and NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast (whose stake is undisclosed).\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe company was founded on September 16, 2011, by Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy upon the relaunch of the photo sharing app Picaboo as Snapchat. On December 31, 2013, the application was hacked and 4.6 million usernames and phone numbers were leaked to the Internet.[13]\n\nBy January 2014, the company had refused offers of acquisition, including overtures from Mark Zuckerberg, with Spiegel commenting that \"trading that for some short-term gain isn’t very interesting.\"[14]\n\nIn May 2014, the company acquired the software company AddLive to provide needed technology to create a new video chat feature.[15] In that same month, it settled U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) charges over its having misled users regarding its collection of their address book data and transmission of their locations (without notice or consent), and regarding its claim that user messages disappeared after their expiration (rather than remaining accessible, as they had).[16] In December, the company acquired Vergence Labs for $15 million in cash and stock, who were the developers of Epiphany Eyewear, and the mobile app Scan for $50 million, which was revealed during the 2014 Sony Pictures hack.[17][18]\n\nIn May 2015, the company moved from its original headquarters to a 47,000 ft2 (4,366 m2) office complex near Venice Beach and signed a 10-year lease.[19] They were one of the first prominent online platforms to establish themselves there, alongside others such as Whisper and Tinder, giving Venice the new title of \"Silicon Beach.\"[20][21] In February 2017, two weeks before the company's IPO, The New York Times published a feature about Snap's role in turning the area into a technology hub, noting that Snap, with a total of 1,900 employees, had \"already changed the face of Venice.\"[22]\n\nIn September 2015, Snapchat acquired Looksery to develop Lenses for its mobile app, a feature based on Looksery's facial recognition software.[23]\n\nIn March, July, and August 2016, the company acquired Bitstrips for $100 million, Obvious Engineering, the developers of Seene, for an undisclosed amount and Vurb for $100 million.[24][25][26] Vurb formerly developed the eponymous mobile search engine. The Vurb card-based engine removed the need to switch through multiple other applications on the device to perform a task.[27]\n\nIn September 2016, the company officially named itself Snap Inc., and unveiled smartglasses known as Spectacles.[28][29][30] In November 2016, the company filed documents for an initial public offering (IPO) with an estimated market value of $25–35 billion.[31][32][33] In December 2016, the company opened research and development in Shenzhen and acquired advertising and technology company Flite and Israel-based augmented reality startup Cimagine Media for $30–40 million.[34][35][36][37] A partnership issued in December 2016 with Turner Broadcasting System will allow integration of Turner properties on Snapchat, while cooperating with Snap Inc. to develop original content.[38]\n\nIn January 2017, the company announced that it had established an international headquarters in Soho, London.[39] In early February 2017, the company confirmed their plans for an IPO in 2017 and its expectation to raise $3 billion.[40] In early March 2017, the company went public under the trading symbol SNAP, and raised almost $30 billion in market capitalization on the first day of trading.[41]\n\nIn late May 2017, the company acquired the location sharing app Zenly in a cash and stock deal. The Zenly app will remain functional, but its concepts were incorporated into a Snapchat feature added in June 2017.[42][43]\n\nIn August 2017, Business Insider reported that Google discussed an offer to buy the company for $30 billion in early 2016.[44]\n\nIn October 2017, the company announced that it had formed a joint venture with NBCUniversal to produce content for Snap's platforms, and that it had signed Duplass Brothers Productions as its first partner.[45]\n\nIn November 2017, Tencent acquired a 12% non-voting minority equity stake of the company in the open market.[46]\n\nOn October 26, 2018, at TwitchCon, Snap launched a new desktop application for macOS and Windows known as Snap Camera. It allows users to utilize Snapchat filters via PC webcams in video chat and live streaming services such as Skype, Twitch, YouTube, and Zoom. Snap also announced additional integration with Twitch.[47]\n\nIn August 2022, The Verge reported that Snap would be laying off 20% of its 6,400-person workforce.[48] The layoffs primarily impacted the company's hardware division and the developer products including the separately run Zenly.[48]\n\nOn 5 February 2024, Snap Inc. announced it would lay off 10% of its global workforce, approximately 500 employees, partly to enhance in-person collaboration, marking another significant reduction following a 20% staff cut in 2022.[49]\n\nOn September 12, 2024, Snap appointed Yahoo CEO Jim Lanzone to its board of directors.[50]\n\nProducts\n\n[edit]\n\nThe company develops and maintains the image messaging and multimedia mobile app Snapchat, as well as the Snapchat's Augmented Reality (AR) ad lens. The function was launched in September 2015. Specifically, the AR ad lens is one of the unique features of Snapchat, which allows advertisers to attract their target audience with various innovative lenses. Users can also use these lenses to change their faces, appearance, and even surroundings based on their preferences, and share those visual images or videos within their social networks.[51] In addition, the company also develops and manufactures the wearable camera called Spectacles, a pair of smartglasses that connect to the user's Snapchat account and records videos in a circular video format adjustable in any orientation.[52] On February 20, 2017, Snap Spectacles became available for purchase online.[53] The company sold only 220,000 pairs of Snap Spectacles V1. The company developed and launched Spectacles V2 in April 2018 in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and France; and 13 more European countries in May 2018.[54] On April 28, 2022, the company announced a mini drone called Pixy.[55] Later that year in August, it was reported that future development of Pixy would be discontinued, while continuing to sell the current iteration of the drone.[56]\n\nFunding and shares\n\n[edit]\n\nSnapchat app raised $485,000 in its seed round and an undisclosed amount of bridge funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners.[57] By February 2013, Snapchat confirmed a $13.5 million Series A funding round led by Benchmark, which valued the company at between $60 million and $70 million.[58] In June 2013, Snapchat raised $60 million in a Series B funding round led by venture capital firm Institutional Venture Partners.[59] The firm also appointed a new high-profile board member, Michael Lynton of Sony's American division.[60] By mid-July 2013, a media report valued the company at $860 million.[61] On November 14, 2013, The Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook offered to acquire Snapchat for $3 billion, but Spiegel declined the cash offer.[62] Tech writer Om Malik then claimed on November 15, 2013, that Google had offered $4 billion, but Spiegel again declined.[63] On December 11, 2013, Snapchat confirmed $50 million in Series C funding from Coatue Management.[64] Beyond 2014, the company had achieved a $10–$20 billion valuation, depending on the source, raising $100 million in Series D funding led by KPCB[65] and $485 million in a Series E round led by Alibaba Group.[66][67] Investors included General Catalyst, Kingdom Holding Company, SV Angel, Yahoo!, and Tencent. According to reports in May 2016, the company's estimated worth was said to be approaching $22.7 billion in the event of a new Series F round of investment of $1.8 billion from Spark Capital, General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital, T. Rowe Price, Meritech Capital Partners, Dragoneer Investment Group and others, led by Fidelity Investments.[68] Later, the company got an additional $200 million in the following Series FP round.[69] Further reports in 2016 suggested that funding was almost at $3 billion and that Snapchat was targeting yearly revenues of a billion dollars.[70]\n\nGoogle reportedly offered Snap $30 billion in 2016 for acquisition, which Snap turned down.[71]\n\n2017 initial public offering\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that \"people familiar with the matter\" stated that Snap Inc. would share 2.5% of the money raised in an upcoming initial public offering (IPO) with the banks managing the IPO. It also reported that after the predicted March 2017 IPO, the two Snap co-founders would hold over \"70% of the voting power\" in the company and own around 45% of the total stock.[72] On January 29, 2017, it was reported that the Snap Inc. IPO would likely take place on the New York Stock Exchange. As both the NYSE and Nasdaq had been \"aggressively courting the listing for more than a year,\" the Wall Street Journal called it \"a big competitive victory for the Big Board.\" Snap's IPO was estimated to value the company at between $20 billion and $25 billion, the largest IPO on a US exchange since Alibaba debuted in 2014 at a value of $168 billion.[73] Beyond the two founders, the two biggest shareholders for the planned early 2017 Snap IPO were Benchmark and Lightspeed Venture Partners, both prior investors and venture-capital firms from Silicon Valley. They held a combined stake of about 20%.[74] On March 1, 2017, it was reported that Snap Inc. \"values itself at nearly $24B with its IPO pricing.\"[75] Snap Inc.'s stock started trading on March 2, 2017, under the symbol SNAP, on the New York Stock Exchange.[76]\n\nWhen Snap reported earnings for the first time in May 2017, they reported a $2.2 billion quarterly loss, and the stock fell more than 20%, erasing most of the gains since the IPO.[77] Its market capitalization reached $100 billion for the first time on 22 February 2021.[78]\n\nIn February 2024 stock fell 30% after earnings with disappointing profit guidance.[79] Market capitalisation as of 3 March 2024 was $18B, below 2017 IPO level.[80]\n\nControversy\n\n[edit]\n\nReggie Brown lawsuit\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2013, Reggie Brown sued Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy. Early investors were also eventually named in the lawsuit. Brown said that he had once been the chief marketing officer for the initial selfie app used to launch Snapchat, offering evidence of contacts with publications such as Cosmopolitan. He also claimed that he had come up with the original concept, which he had ultimately called Picaboo, and that he had created the mascot logo for the product while working with Spiegel to promote and market the idea. Originally titled \"Toyopa Group, LLC,\" Brown said that he had named the newly formed company as well. Brown's lawyers offered documentation of a collaboration with Spiegel and Murphy, which included the filing of an original patent by the three Stanford classmates, but Snapchat described the lawsuit as meritless and called Brown's tactics a \"shakedown\". During April's depositions, Brown testified that he had believed he was an equal partner, and that he had agreed to share costs and profits. Spiegel instead described Brown as an unpaid intern who had been given an opportunity to earn valuable experience, and although Murphy claimed that he had not fully understood what Brown's role was supposed to have been, he too characterized Brown's involvement as having been that of an internship. Months later, Spiegel dismissed the lawsuit as an example of opportunists who seek out rapidly successful companies in an attempt \"to also profit from the hard work of others.\"[81][82][83][84][85][86][87][88]\n\nOn 9 September 2014, the company announced that they had settled the lawsuit for an initially undisclosed amount. The settlement amount was revealed on 2 February, 2017, in Snap's SEC public filing to be $157.5 million.[89][90] As part of the settlement, they credited Brown with the conceptual idea for Snapchat.[91]\n\nThe press release published by Snapchat's communication department quoted Spiegel:\n\n\"We are pleased that we have been able to resolve this matter in a manner that is satisfactory to Mr. Brown and the Company. We acknowledge Reggie's contribution to the creation of Snapchat and appreciate his work in getting the application off the ground.\"[91]\n\nFTC settlement\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission alleged that the company had exaggerated to the public the degree to which mobile app images and photos could actually be made to disappear. Following a settlement in 2014, Snapchat was not fined, but the app service agreed to have its claims and policies monitored by an independent party for a period of 20 years.[92]\n\n2018 redesign\n\n[edit]\n\nThe redesign of the Snapchat app in early 2018 made changes for which many users were not happy.[93][94] Around 1.2 million people petitioned Snap, Inc. to roll back the redesign. Snap, Inc's reply makes no concessions, other than noting, \"We completely understand the new Snapchat has felt uncomfortable for many.\"[95][96][97]\n\nDue to the redesign and other market factors in 2018, such as the growth of Instagram Stories and WhatsApp Status,[98] Daily Active Users (DAU) of the app only rose 2% from Q4 2017. Snap, Inc. stock fell more than 15% in after-hours trading following the earnings report release.[99][100][101][102] Growth of daily active users slowed in Q1 2018, and the growth rate for Q2 2018 was \"planned to decelerate rapidly from Q1 levels.\"[103] Snap, Inc. has commented on the redesign, saying, \"We have also started to realise some of the positive benefits [of the redesign], including increased new user retention for older users.\"[103] Some publishers feel the turn towards the older demographic spells the end for the app.[104]\n\nData storage\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a December 2020 announcement, Google Cloud confirmed the development of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) it signed with Saudi Aramco. The update stated the possibility of exploring options to establish cloud services in Saudi, where it confirmed storing Snapchat data. The decision was contested by Access Now, a non-profit organization, and CIPPIC, a Canadian public interest technology law clinic. The firms objected to Google's decision of choosing Saudi Arabia as its new Google Cloud region overlooking an alarming record of human rights abuse and longstanding surveillance accusations. The firms claimed that placing the personal information of millions of Snapchat users there would put it under the jurisdiction of the government of Saudi Arabia, jeopardizing the security of the data.[105][106][107]\n\nCalifornia civil rights lawsuit\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 2024, Snap paid $15 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the California Civil Rights Department alleging that the company discriminated against female employees with respect to pay and promotions, failed to prevent workplace sexual harassment, and retaliated against women who complained.[108][109]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",
      "# [New Features to Help Protect Our Community](https://values.snap.com/news/new-features-to-help-protect-our-community)\nToday we’re announcing our plans for new features to further safeguard our community from online harms. Our new suite of tools will include expanded in-app warnings, enhanced friending protections, simplified location-sharing, and blocking improvements – all designed to reinforce the real friend relationships that make Snapchat so unique.\n\nThese expanded features build on our ongoing work to make it difficult for strangers to contact people on Snapchat. For example, we don’t allow anyone to be messaged by someone they haven’t already added as a friend, or have in their phone contacts. In other words, Snapchatters must proactively select who they communicate with.\n\nToday we are introducing the upcoming tools to help keep our community safe:\n\nExpanded In-App Warnings\n\nLast November, we introduced a pop-up warning when a teen receives a message from someone they don’t already share mutual friends with or have in their contacts. The message informs teens of potential risk so they can carefully consider if they want to be in contact and reminds them to only connect with people they trust. Since launch, this feature has empowered millions of Snapchatters to take action, leading to more than 12 million blocks. 1\n\nNow we’re planning to expand these in-app warnings to incorporate new and advanced signals. Once launched, these features will prompt teens to see a warning message if they receive a chat from someone who has been blocked or reported by others, or is from a region where the teen’s network isn't typically located – signs that the person may be a scammer.\n\nEnhanced Friending Protections\n\nPreviously we shared that teens will not be suggested in Quick Add or Search unless they have multiple mutual connections with the other person. We are now adding new friending safeguards that, coupled with our expanded in-app warnings, make it much harder for strangers to find and add teens:\n\nWe will prevent delivery of a friend request altogether when teens send or receive a friend request from someone they don't have mutual friends with, and that person also has a history of accessing Snapchat in locations often associated with scamming activity. This applies regardless of whether the friend request was sent out by a teen, or sent to a teen from a potential bad actor.\n\nTaken together, these two updates continue our work to address a growing trend of sophisticated sextortion scams, committed by financially motivated bad actors, typically located outside the U.S. and interacting with potential victims across a combination of online platforms.\n\nThese updates build on our work to combat online sextortion: We have never offered public friend lists (which can be used to facilitate sextortion schemes), we use signal-based detection to identify and remove bad actors before they have the opportunity to target others, we have invested in global cross-platform research, and we collaborate with other platforms to combat this crime and other potential harms. We encourage Snapchatters to learn more through our educational resources, like our in-app Safety Snapshot on financial sextortion, and on our Privacy & Safety Hub.\n\nSimplified Location-Sharing and Additional Reminders\n\nWe send all Snapchatters – including teens – regular reminders to check their account security and privacy settings, and only allow Snapchatters to share their location with friends. Now we’re introducingmore frequent reminders to make sure that Snapchatters are always up to date on which friends they’re sharing their location with on the Snap Map. We’re also introducing simplified location-sharing, making it easier for Snapchatters to customize which of their friends can see their location. With these updates, Snapchatters have a single destination to see exactly which friends they are sharing their location with, update their location settings, and remove their location from the map.\n\nAs always, location sharing on the Snap Map remains off by default, meaning that Snapchatters have to proactively opt in to share where they are. And Snapchatters can only ever share their whereabouts with their existing Snapchat friends – there is no option to broadcast their location to the wider Snapchat community.\n\nBlocking Improvements\n\nWe have long offered tools for Snapchatters to easily block someone if they no longer wish to be in touch with them. Sometimes, bad actors create new accounts and continue to try to contact people who have blocked them. In an effort to prevent bullying and potential repeat harassment, we’re introducing improvements to our blocking tools: Blocking a user will also now block new friend requests sent from other accounts created on the same device.\n\nThese new tools build on our ongoing commitment to help Snapchatters communicate with their close friends in an environment that prioritizes their safety, privacy, and well-being. We look forward to continuing to create even more protections, tools, and resources to help protect our community.",

All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this press release, including statements regarding guidance, our future results of operations or financial condition, future stock repurchase programs or stock dividends, business strategy and plans, user growth and engagement, product initiatives, objectives of management for future operations, and advertiser and partner offerings, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “going to,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” or “would” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions. We caution you that the foregoing may not include all of the forward-looking statements made in this press release.\n\nYou should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this press release primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends, including our financial outlook, macroeconomic uncertainty, and geo-political events and conflicts, that we believe may continue to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties related to: our financial performance; our ability to attain and sustain profitability; our ability to generate and sustain positive cash flow; our ability to attract and retain users, partners, and advertisers; competition and new market entrants; managing our growth and future expenses; compliance with new laws, regulations, and executive actions; our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property; our ability to succeed in existing and new market segments; our ability to attract and retain qualified team members and key personnel; our ability to repay or refinance outstanding debt, or to access additional financing; future acquisitions, divestitures, or investments; and the potential adverse impact of climate change, natural disasters, health epidemics, macroeconomic conditions, and war or other armed conflict, as well as risks, uncertainties, and other factors described in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our most recent periodic report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, which is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will be made available in our periodic report that will be filed with the SEC for the period covered by this press release and other filings that we make from time to time with the SEC. In addition, any forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, including future developments related to geo-political events and conflicts and macroeconomic conditions, except as required by law.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nWe use the non-GAAP financial measure of Free Cash Flow, which is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, reduced by purchases of property and equipment. We believe Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available, after capital expenditures, for operational expenses and investment in our business and is a key financial indicator used by management. Additionally, we believe that Free Cash Flow is an important measure since we use third-party infrastructure partners to host our services and therefore we do not incur significant capital expenditures to support revenue generating activities. Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet and invest in future growth.\n\nWe use the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net income (loss), excluding interest income; interest expense; other income (expense), net; income tax benefit (expense); depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; payroll and other tax expense related to stock-based compensation; and certain other items impacting net income (loss) from time to time. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA helps identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nWe use the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP net income (loss), which is defined as net income (loss), excluding amortization of intangible assets; stock-based compensation expense; payroll and other tax expense related to stock-based compensation; certain other items impacting net income (loss) from time to time; and related income tax adjustments. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and weighted average diluted shares are then used to calculate non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share. Similar to Adjusted EBITDA, we believe these measures help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses we exclude in the measure.\n\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our financial performance, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by our management for financial and operational decision-making. We are presenting these non-GAAP measures to assist investors in seeing our financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry.\n\nFor a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n\nSnap Inc., “Snapchat,” and our other registered and common law trade names, trademarks, and service marks are the property of Snap Inc. or our subsidiaries.\n\nTotal depreciation and amortization expense by function:\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nSeptember 30,\n\nNine Months Ended\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense (1):\n\nCost of revenue\n\n$\n\n965\n\n$\n\n3,184\n\n$\n\n4,987\n\n$\n\n9,580\n\nResearch and development\n\n24,798\n\n26,252\n\n75,305\n\n75,238\n\nSales and marketing\n\n4,953\n\n5,466\n\n14,614\n\n16,144\n\nGeneral and administrative\n\n8,134\n\n6,307\n\n23,587\n\n15,155\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n38,850\n\n$\n\n41,209\n\n$\n\n118,493\n\n$\n\n116,117\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241029506113/en/\n\nInvestors and Analysts:\n\nir@snap.com\n\nPress:\n\npress@snap.com\n\nSource: Snap Inc.",
      "# [Snap Inc. Partners with Google Cloud to Power Multi-Modal Generative AI Experiences Within its My AI Chatbot by Google Cloud on 2024-09-24](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/snap-inc-partners-with-google-cloud-to-power-multi-modal-generative-ai-experiences-within-its-my-ai-chatbot-302256630.html)\nSnapchat saw over 2.5x as much engagement within Snapping to My AI in the United States since deploying Gemini on Vertex AI\n\nSUNNYVALE, Calif., Sept. 24, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Google Cloud today announced an expanded strategic partnership with Snap Inc. to power generative AI experiences within My AI, Snapchat's AI-powered chatbot and one of the largest consumer chatbots available today.\n\nSnapchat will leverage the strong multimodal capabilities of Gemini on Vertex AI, particularly the technology's ability to understand and operate across different types of information like text, audio, image, video, and code, to offer more engaging and innovative features for the Snapchat community through My AI. For example, with Gemini on Vertex AI integrated into the app, Snapchatters can ask My AI to translate a photo of a street sign while traveling abroad, or take a video of different snack offerings to ask which one is the healthiest option.\n\nFirst launched on Google Cloud in 2011, Snapchat offers a fast, fun way to communicate visually with friends and family. The continued popularity of these core product values helps distinguish Snapchat from other internet platforms and has enabled the platform to grow to reach more than 850 million monthly active users.\n\nAs an innovator in the technology space, Snap is helping define how gen AI will help people express themselves, learn about the world, and connect with their friends and family. As the company continues to invest in AI, Snap is already seeing strong business value from its partnership with Google Cloud. Since Snapchat deployed Gemini on Vertex AI to support My AI, the company saw over 2.5x as much engagement within Snapping to My AI in the United States.\n\n\"This partnership with Google Cloud reinforces everything that's so important to serving our community. Snap is all about empowering people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together. Now with Gemini in My AI, Snapchatters can learn so much more about the world, do it really quickly in the moment, and easily share that with friends,\" said Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snap.\n\n\"Snap was an early leader in helping people communicate in a digital world, and now it is at the forefront of using generative AI to build agents that create new value for its community,\" said Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud. \"Gemini models on Vertex AI are now powering millions of multimodal interactions in the Snapchat app every day that allow Snapchatters to better engage with My AI — with built-in accuracy and safety features.\"\n\nSnap and Google Cloud's 10+ year partnership has continued to evolve, with Snap adopting Google Cloud's data, analytics, and AI/ML technologies to fuel growth and shape the customer experience. Multimodal capabilities powered by Google Cloud's generative AI technology are now live for all U.S. Snapchatters in My AI.\n\nAbout Google Cloud\n\nGoogle Cloud is the new way to the cloud, providing AI, infrastructure, developer, data, security, and collaboration tools built for today and tomorrow. Google Cloud offers a powerful, fully integrated, and optimized AI stack with its own planet-scale infrastructure, custom-built chips, generative AI models, and development platform, as well as AI-powered applications, to help organizations transform.

I’ve seen just about every update that has came out, but lately, the updates are just pointless. Stop putting advertisement in my chat messages. I do not want to see advertisements in my chat messages every time I open the app. This type of advertisement is very annoying and I do not want to see it. Do better. Especially for things that I wouldn’t even buy. Also, I’m tired of getting a notification to add someone on my snap who isn’t even a friend. I’m tired of getting notifications to look at spotlight. I do not want to look at spotlight. I do not want to add people who are not my friends. The app will not stop giving me suggestions for things I do not care about. There is nothing in the settings to stop it from showing me suggestions of “friends” that aren’t even people I know. Every day I get on Snapchat there is a red notification trying to get me to add random person or check out random videos. Snapchat is supposed to be for showing your friends quick videos and funny things in a quick way. It is too flooded with public profiles and pointless videos to make you keep scrolling.\n\nZamzam !! ,\n\nPermanently Locked account because i was hacked?\n\nMy account was hacked and wrongfully made inaccessible as there was a malfunction with Snapchat's software in detecting a breach in snapchat rules. What got me banned was “bullying and harrassment” even though it wasn’t me who posted all the things and the people who were posted were my friends we are all good with each other and we talked about it. With no prior breaches, my account was made indefinitely inaccessible within seconds, with no opportunity to appeal the ability to log in. I've had my account for 3 or more years, and with no option to dispute the breach through snapchat support I've had to reach you guys through any means necessary. I know people who are plugs through snapchat, or post videos of them drinking underage who still have their accounts, so i feel it is unfair these people are allowed to have their accounts while mine got banned so quickly. I tried making new accounts and they all got banned, and every time i submit an appeal all i ever get is a automated response, they don’t even have real humans responding to peoples problems. i don't want to lose my account, or the years of photos and videos i won't be able to get back. know this exact situation has happened to lots of people, so i'm hoping you guys can help me.",
      "# [13 Years at Snap Inc.](https://newsroom.snap.com/13-years-at-snap)\nDear Team,\n\nThank you so much for your extraordinary efforts and dedication to our business. Over the past year we successfully reversed two years of declining year-over-year revenue growth and are pacing towards record annual revenue. We built a sustainable cost structure, resulting in improved earnings and cash flow – again reversing two years of declines. We’ve made enormous progress growing our community to reach more than 850 million people, while growing content time spent +25% globally in Q2. Successful turnarounds are the exception and not the rule in business, and our progress to-date returning to growth is the result of your perseverance, focus, and teamwork. In the year ahead, we will prove that our progress is sustainable while further accelerating the growth of our advertising business and diversifying our revenue with Snapchat+.\n\nYou may be wondering why, with all of the progress we’ve made in our business over the last year, our share price performance has lagged the overall market. The answer is simple: our advertising business is growing slower than our competitors. The growth of our digital advertising business is one of the most important inputs to our long term revenue potential, and investors are concerned that we aren’t growing faster. Our lower growth rate reflects the ongoing evolution of our advertising business from one primarily driven by a small number of large customers spending against brand-oriented upper funnel goals to one that has a greater balance among different advertiser types and goals, with a much larger number of small- and medium-sized customers who are bidding against lower funnel goals. This evolution is well underway: In Q2, even as our upper funnel brand revenue declined by 1%, our lower funnel direct response revenue grew by 16%.\n\nOver the years, we have found that lower funnel revenue generated by small- and medium-sized customers is more predictable and stable than upper funnel revenue. It also represents a larger long term opportunity for revenue growth. Lower funnel revenue is ‘stickier’ because it is more closely tied to key business objectives and positive returns on ad spend, and as its scale increases it becomes more predictable because it is diversified across a larger number of advertisers and sectors. As we have learned from navigating the volatile macroeconomic environment, our business will be more resilient if more of our revenue is generated from a larger number of advertisers focused on lower funnel goals. With active advertisers more than doubling year over year in Q2, we’ve made a lot of progress, but there is more work to do.\n\nAs we look ahead to 2025, we need to grow our lower funnel business even faster while simultaneously reaccelerating the growth of our upper funnel business. We’re going to do that by changing the way that we go to market, introducing new ad placements powered by automation, and continuing to invest in our machine learning platform to deliver powerful results for our advertising partners.\n\nWhen we first introduced vertical video ads they were a novel and unique offering, but today this format has been embraced by most of our competitors. That means vertical video is less differentiated than it once was, and despite our unique and unduplicated reach in many of the world’s largest digital advertising markets, we need to further evolve our ad products and strategy to stand out. Unlike our competitors, we offer a lot more than a content platform. People use Snapchat to communicate with their friends and family, use our camera and Lenses, peruse their Memories, see what their friends and family are up to on the Snap Map, and more. Despite the many and differentiated ways that people use our service, we’ve historically focused our go-to-market efforts on the vertical video ad format within our content offerings. There is a significant opportunity to better surface insights based on the unique ways that people use Snapchat, generate actionable recommendations for advertisers, and deliver better outcomes by leveraging new ad placements across our service.\n\nIn the coming months, we’re going to start surfacing more unique and actionable insights to advertisers based on the diversity of engagement on Snapchat. Privacy-safe insights around store visitation powered by the Snap Map, interactions with Lenses through our camera, and public content posts in Stories and Spotlight can help advertisers drive better performance and engagement with our community. Today, many of these insights are only accessible through disparate tools that made it harder to serve our advertising partners. Bringing these insights together into a single, self-serve tool and helping convert them into actionable recommendations will allow us to demonstrate the power of our differentiated platform to advertisers while giving them the tools they need to resonate with the Snapchat community.\n\nIn addition to differentiated insights, we are also experimenting with two new ad placements: Sponsored Snaps and Promoted Places. These placements will help us meet the goals of our advertising partners by aligning our unique insights with differentiated solutions to drive return on investment across Snapchat. Importantly, both of these placements are designed to leverage the same full-screen vertical video Snap Ad format already used across Snapchat so that advertisers can automate placement across our service without having to develop bespoke creatives.\n\nSponsored Snaps empower advertisers to communicate visually with the Snapchat community, making the core functionality of Snapchat accessible to advertisers. Sponsored Snaps appear in the chat inbox as a new Snap without a push notification, and opening the message is optional. This allows advertisers to engage prospective customers all the way down the funnel all within a single ad unit; raise awareness with broad reach in the chat inbox, improve consideration with people who choose to view the Snap, and drive conversion with an in-message call-to-action. As we continue to evolve Sponsored Snaps, we are excited to enable more messaging features powered by generative AI and integrated into advertiser CRMs to help our partners communicate with their customers at scale. As always, your conversations with friends are private and are not used for advertising purposes.\n\nWith more than 350 million people using the Snap Map, we now offer one of the most used maps on mobile. Instead of using our map to get directions from A to B, people use the Snap Map to see what their friends are up to, explore new places, and keep track of their favorite spots. We’ve also found that places highlighted on the map can drive incremental visitation. For example, there is a typical visitation lift of 17.6% for frequent Snap users shown Top Pick-annotated places, relative to users shown a place without an annotation. With Promoted Places, businesses can use the Snap Map to reach incremental customers who are exploring places nearby and easily measure the visitation lift with our closed-loop and privacy-safe measurement.\n\nWe’ve made tremendous progress improving our advertising platform over the past year, growing our investment in ML infrastructure and building larger models using fresher data. We will continue to invest in our ML engineering team and infrastructure to better utilize privacy-safe signals, further consolidate our models to improve performance and reduce operational burden, improve cold start, and develop new model architectures with better feature representations. We will focus on key product offerings like dynamic product ads, app objectives, target cost bidding, and value optimization. We will help advertisers better optimize for in-session conversions and remove friction from the purchase flow by making it easier for Snapchatters to make purchases in-app. All of these investments will be enhanced by new, simplified, and automated tools to streamline buying across different placements, enable intelligent audience expansion, and optimize budgets across ad sets to maximize campaign performance.\n\nThe growth of our advertising business is only possible because our community loves to use Snapchat. Our product strategy has been inspired in part by In-N-Out Burger. In-N-Out has developed a loyal following by using high quality ingredients, focusing on doing a few things exceptionally well, and obsessing over customer satisfaction to deliver an excellent customer experience. Their hamburger, cheeseburger, and Double-Double are our Snapping, chatting, and watching Stories. You can decide which parts of our product are the milkshake, fries, and secret menu. We’ve learned the benefits of focusing on our core product experiences and making them truly great, and this year we intend to double-down on what is working.\n\nThe way we grow our community is by enabling Snapping. Visual communication is at the heart of what we do, it’s universally appealing - fast, fun, and deeply expressive. Snapping brings people together in ways that no other medium of communication yet invented has been able to do, and in doing so makes people feel happier and closer to their friends and family. This year we will continue to make it easier for people to start Snapping and chatting with their friends and family. We know that Snapping is a key driver of retention and frequency of using Snapchat, and most importantly - it makes a positive impact.\n\nGenerative AI has been transformative for our camera and Lens experiences, empowering people to express themselves in a Snap. Our AI Lenses are already some of the most used Lenses on Snapchat, and our on-devices model will allow us to further scale these experiences with faster generation and lower cost. This year brings many more opportunities to further improve identity preservation in generative Snaps, enable generative video experiences, and help people reinterpret and reimagine their Memories in new ways. Our innovation in generative AI isn’t limited to the camera. Teams across Snap have been embracing multimodal LLMs, powering everything from My AI to new trust and safety tools. Everyone at Snap should brainstorm ways that generative AI can make our business more efficient and better at serving our community. If you have an idea, we want to hear about it!\n\nThe growth we’ve observed in our content business this year has primarily resulted from improvements to personalization and increases in content supply, especially from creators of public Stories and Spotlight videos. We’ve been testing a combined content experience that brings together Stories and Spotlight into one full screen and easy-to-navigate interface. This helps improve the discoverability of new creators and content genres by moving beyond the tile-based discovery we offer today in Discover. We’re also testing a further simplified version of Snapchat that aims to improve accessibility and usability. While early tests have been directionally positive, we will be thoughtful and deliberate about making a change of this magnitude. Rolling out this simplified version of Snapchat should also provide new opportunities to improve application performance and load times.\n\nWe’ve also been working hard to help creators realize their full potential on Snapchat. Creators often share that they value Snapchat because of the relationship that they are able to develop with their audience through tools like Story replies. This year we are working on new ways for brands to collaborate with creators to develop unique ad creative and promote their products. We’re proud of the significant revenue share that we provide to creators and publishers and these new brand collaboration tools will offer further opportunities for creators to benefit from their creativity and reach on Snapchat. We’ll have more to share at our upcoming Snap Partner Summit on September 17th.\n\nThe reason that I’ve dedicated so much of my life to building Snap is because I believe deeply in the power of technology to make a positive impact in people’s lives. Over the past 250 years, the productivity gains resulting from continual technological advancements have driven the most extraordinary increase in overall human well-being in history. I worry that the techno-utopianism brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, when people were overly reliant on the Internet to live their lives, has given way to a regressive and alarmist moral panic about technology that threatens further societal progress. We need a balanced approach to, and a healthy relationship with, the technological advancements that improve our lives.\n\nWe believe that the responsibility to make a positive impact with technology begins with our own actions and I am so profoundly proud of our team for contributing in a positive way through the service we provide. New independent research validates what we have long known about Snapchat and how we are different from social media:\n\nRecent research 1 from the Netherlands into adolescent use of large social media platforms concludes that Snapchat is the only platform that positively impacts well-being. Snapchat also has a strong positive effect on friendships and no net negative effect on self-esteem. The researchers conclude that:\n\n\"We found a consistent negative impact of time spent on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube across all three mental health dimensions. Conversely, spending time on Snapchat positively affected friendship closeness and well-being but had no significant impact on self-esteem. Using WhatsApp had a notably strong effect on friendship closeness but no significant effect on well-being and self-esteem.\"\n\n\"The positive and null effects associated with Snapchat and WhatsApp indicate that we should avoid a blanket condemnation of all social media platforms.\"\n\n\"Given their widespread and frequent use among adolescents, the negative effects of TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram on well-being, self-esteem, and friendship closeness are highly concerning. These particular platforms employ advanced algorithms to curate personalized content, capturing users’ attention and keeping them continuously engaged. These algorithms can draw users into a near-hypnotic cycle of infinite scrolling. And indeed, nearly half of adolescents report that they use social media much longer than intended, leading to feelings of time wasted and time taken away from other valued activities. Consequently, the design of these platforms may play a critical role in adversely affecting adolescents’ mental health. Therefore, more research is urgently needed to explore how specific design features may contribute to – and can potentially counteract – these negative outcomes.\"\n\nAs part of the Australian Parliament’s investigation into social media and Australian society, three Australian mental health organizations recently jointly submitted research results 2 to Parliament with similar findings. These results were derived from The Future Proofing Study, Australia’s largest longitudinal study into youth mental health, and found that:\n\n\"[A] higher number of hours spent each day on TikTok was significantly associated with greater depression, anxiety, insomnia and disordered eating. A higher number of hours on Instagram was associated with greater depression and anxiety. However, a higher number of hours on Snapchat was not found to be significantly associated with any of the mental health symptoms examined….\n\nThe differences between these apps are attributed to differences in the way that adolescents use them. The study showed that more frequently using social media to passively consume content was associated with higher symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and disordered eating. The design of TikTok and Instagram encourages its users to passively consume content; using algorithms to deliver its users targeted content and various features such as ‘infinite scroll’ that keep its users engaged for long periods of time. By contrast, the study found no evidence to indicate that using social media to facilitate social connections was associated with poorer mental health. Rather, it found that more frequently using social media to communicate with people teens knew in real life was associated with lower symptoms of depression and anxiety. This may explain why higher number of hours using Snapchat was not associated with any of the mental health symptoms examined, because Snapchat is a messaging app that adolescents primarily use to communicate with their friends.\"\n\nThis doesn’t mean that bad things can’t happen when people use Snapchat. That’s why we’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars in our trust and safety teams over the past several years and designed our service to help keep people safe by moderating content and only allowing people to communicate with the friends they’ve selected. We’ll continue these investments, leveraging powerful large language models to help us scale moderation with higher accuracy. We’ve also developed new resources for educators and parents to help them learn more about using Snapchat responsibly. Our work to keep our community safe is never done, and we will continue to dedicate ourselves to these efforts.\n\nDespite our extraordinary efforts to make the smartphones we use every day better by introducing vertical video, ephemeral messaging, Stories, Lenses, and more, we continue to bump up against the limitations of screens. Smartphone screens distract us from the real world, require us to use small touchscreens to express ourselves, and aren’t designed to be shared with friends. That’s why we’ve been working to build augmented reality glasses for over a decade. Glasses are already worn by billions of people and allow us to interact with the real world using see-through lenses. As Alan Kay said, “People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware” and we’ve been focused on enabling extraordinary new software experiences brought to life through Spectacles.\n\nOur efforts to build Spectacles are part of what the business school crowd calls Blue Ocean Strategy, a concept introduced by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne that describes new, unknown market space where there is no competitor and demand is created rather than fought over. Blue Ocean Strategy plays to our strengths as an innovator and leader in augmented reality. Interestingly, Kim and Mauborgne find “large R&D budgets are not the key to creating new market space. The key is making the right strategic moves. What’s more, companies that understand what drives a good strategic move will be well-placed to create multiple blue oceans over time, thereby continuing to deliver high growth and profits over a sustained period. The creation of blue oceans, in other words, is a product of strategy and as such is very much a product of managerial action.” Or, in other words, a product of things that are under our control.\n\nToday, the market for augmented reality glasses is nascent. While we continue to differentiate and win share in the highly competitive market for digital advertising (a “red ocean”), we are investing in creating augmented reality glasses that allow people to interact with computing, the world, and one another in totally new ways. Unlike in digital advertising, where we were a late entrant in a market with established, scaled players, we are a leader in the market for this new type of glasses and in the development of our augmented reality platform that is already used by hundreds of thousands of developers and hundreds of millions of Snapchatters.\n\nReflecting on the past two years, I am in awe of our team’s ability to navigate an incredibly challenging environment with resilience and determination. Sometimes the most important thing is survival, and our team and business adapted to major upheavals in mobile advertising, increased competition, international conflict, and a challenging and volatile macroeconomic environment with interest rates at their highest levels in more than two decades. Former USA and Duke basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski, known as Coach K, talks about the importance of leaders turning bad things into something that will work for the team. He says, “Don’t worry about losing. Think about winning. In other words, even when you have a loss, you must ask yourself, ‘What is good about this? How can I turn a defeat into something that works for us?’” When I think about our teams and leaders that have made the biggest impact over the past two years, they have always focused on creating opportunities and finding a way to win.\n\nAs we plan for the coming year, we can’t predict the future but we can extrapolate from what we know today. Economic data shows that the United States economy is slowing, with recession indicators like the yield curve and the Sahm Indicator flashing warning signs. Countries around the world are grappling with high debt loads and large ongoing budget deficits. Both US presidential candidates are floating new revenue raisers including tariffs and taxes, which could further slow economic growth. The rapidly evolving regulatory environment continues to strain our team, and new legislation around the world may introduce further compliance burdens if we get lumped in with other tech companies despite the different design choices we made while building our service. Court proceedings on the TikTok divestment legislation loom in the coming months.\n\nIn short, we must continue to expect the unexpected. The uncertainty we’re anticipating around the world further emphasizes the importance of diversified revenue streams including an advertising business serving a large number of advertisers bidding against lower funnel, direct response objectives, and subscription revenue from Snapchat+. It also means that we are investing conservatively against a baseline plan that assumes modest ad revenue growth, while we work towards higher growth rates. This means that in a downside scenario, we are still well positioned to generate free cash flow with our current cost structure. We’ve also taken steps to further fortify our balance sheet with more than $3 billion in cash and marketable securities and no meaningful debt maturities until 2027. We believe that this conservative approach allows our team to focus on driving the long term growth of our business without having to worry as much about external volatility.\n\nOne of the consequences of constrained resourcing in our functionally-organized business is that leaner teams must work even more closely together to get work done, which makes them more prone to conflict. This is especially relevant as we have worked through the enormous challenges of the past few years, where adverse outcomes make it harder for us to take accountability for our own actions, and easier to point fingers and blame others. It’s never been more important to clearly and rigorously prioritize our highest impact initiatives, and take shared goals across teams to drive more alignment.",

In the pages of this magazine, you will discover exciting new programs and initiatives, meaningful and impactful stories, and inspiring student, faculty and alumni spotlights.\n\nEncouraging Students to Take Risks\n\nPatrick Harris' Journey to Snap Inc. President of Americas & Global Partnerships\n\nby Katie Payne\n\nFor Patrick Harris ’98, the road to becoming president of Snap Inc. in the Americas might never have been traveled — if it wasn’t for advice he received as an undergrad from a professor at the University of San Diego.\n\nWhile taking an HTML class during what Harris calls the days of “early internet,” his professor, Robert Hanczor, said to him, “You know if you’re really interested in pursuing media as a career, you should probably go to New York and do an internship,” Harris recalls.\n\nIt piqued Harris's curiosity, a communication studies major with a minor in business, so he decided to go for it. The summer before his senior year at USD, Harris interned at Turner Broadcasting Interactive for a new website at the time, CNN.com. From there, he caught the internet bug, and the experience reinforced his desire to work in media, although he did “not really know what part of media I wanted to be connected to.”\n\n“It’s amazing the difference even just one professor can make,” Harris says. Since graduating from USD, he’s held roles at internet search engine Ask Jeeves, ad agency Reprise Media, Microsoft before it became Bing, and perhaps most notably Facebook (now Meta) for 12 years. “It’s small moments that led to all of these progressions,” Harris says.",
