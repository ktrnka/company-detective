The recent updates have brought back the beloved normal characters, which is a definite plus. The app's quality is top-notch, ensuring a smooth experience when using it. However, the removal of games has left a void in the overall experience. The games were a great way to pass the time and added an extra layer of entertainment to the app. I hope Snapchat considers bringing them back in the future. Another downside is the dependency on wifi for optimal performance. Without a strong wifi connection, the app's quality can suffer, leading to delays and glitches. Overall, Snapchat remains a fun and engaging platform despite these drawbacks. I would highly recommend it for its communication features and interactive elements, with the hope that improvements continue to enhance the user experience.",

I have contacted you guys on ever way possible, email, twitter, TikTok, instagram, etc. I keep getting automated responses through Snapchat support. My account was hacked and wrongfully made inaccessible as there was a malfunction with Snapchats software in detecting a breach in Snapchat rules. My account was locked for absolutely no reason July 20th. I belive this was a malfunction because I was not active and did not send post or take a picture of anything for the entire month of June. I have had 0 prior breaches. So with no prior breaches my account was locked and gone. I’ve had this account for about 6 years and have never done anything wrong. It went indefinitely inaccessible within seconds. With no opportunity to log in even tho the email I got it said that this was just a warning. I’ve had to reach to you guys through any means necessary. I know people who post stuff against drug/alcohol guidelines and they still have there account so I just feel like this is completely unfair. If there is anyway you guys could help review the breach to prove I did nothing wrong and did not breach the rules I would greatly appreciate it.

Eryn, Apple App Store, 2024-09-26)](https://apple/11767651266)\nI’ve been a Snapchat user for probably over a decade now, and I can honestly say I used to love going on there and posting stories, using filters and communicating with others. The app as it is currently is frustrating to use other than chatting. First of all, the AI feature; I have no interest in using it whatsoever. but there is not an option for me to get rid of the AI bot. Not only that, it doesn’t matter what friends I have pinned to the top of my chats, the AI bot will “jump” to the top as I tap on my top pinned friend, forcing me to open a chat with it. \n\nSecond of all, I am absolutely sick of getting messages over two times a day every single day from team Snapchat. there is no way to delete the chats that open, the messages themselves are not relevant to anything useful or fun inside of the app, and feels like the equivalent of email spam. \n\nThird, I will only touch on lightly, because I haven’t even really tried to use the filter feature in over two years at this point. The filters are basically unusable outside of the suggested ones within the first couple of options on the camera. previously, I remember being able to search filters and share filters with people, and the relatively easy to use search page. The app features for being able to speed up a video, slow it down, distort voices, etc was also one of my favorites to use in my daily snaps and stories; but since things have changed, I have no idea if those are even options anymore, and honestly don’t care enough to try anymore.\n\nMy fourth, in at most complaint, I will say, is the blatant promotion of soft porn on the public stories page. I have literally spent hours hiding and blocking stories and hitting not interested on as many of these as I can and STILL they persist. it wasn’t even that long ago when the stories on that public page were educational, fun and family friendly. I followed accounts like nat geo, stay tuned, etc that had a more interesting, positive, and educational focus, and now I hardly ever see content from those accounts or see anything similar suggested in my feed. I understand that “sex sells,” but The amount of advertisement, influence, and downright inappropriate content that comes across several social media platforms downright screams predatory. I can only imagine the amount of minors, recovering addicts, and relationships this predatory algorithm and practice has harmed.\n\nTLDR: this app used to be fun to use beyond communication, but now is an annoying reminder of how dysfunctional and dystopian our society has become.",

So, I decided to move to Snapchat, introducing my followers to a platform they weren’t familiar with. My audience trusts me, so I successfully transitioned hundreds of thousands of followers over to Snapchat. Looking back, I wish I hadn’t done that.\n\nOnce you reach a certain level on Snapchat, the platform starts to work against you. It deliberately removes your followers without their consent, making it hard for people to find you. Worse yet, Snapchat intentionally reduces your views, seemingly without reason or transparency.\n\nThere’s absolutely no clarity in how they operate. It’s as if the management is purposely trying to destroy a platform already burdened with financial issues. When you share any link with your followers, they severely punish you by cutting your views in half, even though all your views are from your direct followers, not from Explore.\n\nI’ve been struggling with these issues for the past eight years. Now, I feel stuck — I can’t just start fresh on a new platform and build everything from scratch again, but I also can’t continue with Snapchat the way things are.\n\nOne thing is clear: those running Snapchat will face accountability for their actions. This app will not succeed in the long run and seems destined to collapse. The management is not running things in a natural or fair way.\n\nThis captures the essence of your frustration with Snapchat based on the details you provided.",

This lack of accountability puts users, especially minors, at risk.\n\n Privacy Issues\nSnapchat collects sensitive user data, including location, contacts, and usage habits. This data can be vulnerable to hacking and exploitation, compromising users' privacy.\n\nAddictive Design\nSnapchat's design encourages excessive usage, potentially harming mental health and productivity. Features like streaks and trophies foster competition and anxiety.\n\nPromotion of Harmful Content\nSnapchat has faced criticism for allowing or promoting harmful content, including hate speech, racism, and harmful challenges.\n\nNegative Impact on Youth \nSnapchat can negatively impact youth by promoting unrealistic expectations, body image issues, and peer pressure.",

Somehow I am able to continue posting for around 2 months and in October I get Permanently locked out of my account citing \"violation of user agreement\" huh? For what exactly? I submitted over 50 appeals to Snapchat and went back and forth with their zen desk \"help\" absolutely nothing. No help, no ethics and most of all no regard for the countless amounts of people who use Snapchat to communicate with friends and family for years on end only to ban them with zero warning. I would caution anyone thinking about creating a Snapchat to give your data to someone else. Unfortunately this company MAJORLY lacks ethics and any respect to consumer laws and rights.",

The recent updates have brought back the beloved normal characters, which is a definite plus. The app's quality is top-notch, ensuring a smooth experience when using it. However, the removal of games has left a void in the overall experience. The games were a great way to pass the time and added an extra layer of entertainment to the app. I hope Snapchat considers bringing them back in the future. Another downside is the dependency on wifi for optimal performance. Without a strong wifi connection, the app's quality can suffer, leading to delays and glitches. Overall, Snapchat remains a fun and engaging platform despite these drawbacks. I would highly recommend it for its communication features and interactive elements, with the hope that improvements continue to enhance the user experience.",

AND YOU GUYS ARE NOT LETTING ME DOWNLOAD MY 10 years worth of MEMORIES, that’s actually outrageous. Why do you guys have a email support ssystem if you never ever reply to any emails? I have contacted you guys on ever way possible, email, twitter, TikTok, instagram, etc. I keep getting automated responses through Snapchat support. My account was hacked and wrongfully made inaccessible as there was a malfunction with Snapchats software in detecting a breach in Snapchat rules. My account was locked for absolutely no reason July 20th. I belive this was a malfunction because I was not active and did not send post or take a picture of anything for the entire month of June. I have had 0 prior breaches. So with no prior breaches my account was locked and gone. I’ve had this account for about 6 years and have never done anything wrong. It went indefinitely inaccessible within seconds. With no opportunity to log in even tho the email I got it said that this was just a warning. I’ve had to reach to you guys through any means necessary. I know people who post stuff against drug/alcohol guidelines and they still have there account so I just feel like this is completely unfair. If there is anyway you guys could help review the breach to prove I did nothing wrong and did not breach the rules I would greatly appreciate it. I don’t want to lose my account and years worth of memories, friends, photos, and videos that I will not be able to get back.

Eryn, Apple App Store, 2024-09-26)](https://apple/11767651266)\nI’ve been a Snapchat user for probably over a decade now, and I can honestly say I used to love going on there and posting stories, using filters and communicating with others. The app as it is currently is frustrating to use other than chatting. First of all, the AI feature; I have no interest in using it whatsoever. but there is not an option for me to get rid of the AI bot. Not only that, it doesn’t matter what friends I have pinned to the top of my chats, the AI bot will “jump” to the top as I tap on my top pinned friend, forcing me to open a chat with it. \n\nSecond of all, I am absolutely sick of getting messages over two times a day every single day from team Snapchat. there is no way to delete the chats that open, the messages themselves are not relevant to anything useful or fun inside of the app, and feels like the equivalent of email spam. \n\nThird, I will only touch on lightly, because I haven’t even really tried to use the filter feature in over two years at this point. The filters are basically unusable outside of the suggested ones within the first couple of options on the camera. previously, I remember being able to search filters and share filters with people, and the relatively easy to use search page. The app features for being able to speed up a video, slow it down, distort voices, etc was also one of my favorites to use in my daily snaps and stories; but since things have changed, I have no idea if those are even options anymore, and honestly don’t care enough to try anymore.\n\nMy fourth, in at most complaint, I will say, is the blatant promotion of soft porn on the public stories page. I have literally spent hours hiding and blocking stories and hitting not interested on as many of these as I can and STILL they persist. it wasn’t even that long ago when the stories on that public page were educational, fun and family friendly. I followed accounts like nat geo, stay tuned, etc that had a more interesting, positive, and educational focus, and now I hardly ever see content from those accounts or see anything similar suggested in my feed. I understand that “sex sells,” but The amount of advertisement, influence, and downright inappropriate content that comes across several social media platforms downright screams predatory. I can only imagine the amount of minors, recovering addicts, and relationships this predatory algorithm and practice has harmed.\n\nTLDR: this app used to be fun to use beyond communication, but now is an annoying reminder of how dysfunctional and dystopian our society has become.",

So, I decided to move to Snapchat, introducing my followers to a platform they weren’t familiar with. My audience trusts me, so I successfully transitioned hundreds of thousands of followers over to Snapchat. Looking back, I wish I hadn’t done that.\n\nOnce you reach a certain level on Snapchat, the platform starts to work against you. It deliberately removes your followers without their consent, making it hard for people to find you. Worse yet, Snapchat intentionally reduces your views, seemingly without reason or transparency.\n\nThere’s absolutely no clarity in how they operate. It’s as if the management is purposely trying to destroy a platform already burdened with financial issues. When you share any link with your followers, they severely punish you by cutting your views in half, even though all your views are from your direct followers, not from Explore.\n\nI’ve been struggling with these issues for the past eight years. Now, I feel stuck — I can’t just start fresh on a new platform and build everything from scratch again, but I also can’t continue with Snapchat the way things are.\n\nOne thing is clear: those running Snapchat will face accountability for their actions. This app will not succeed in the long run and seems destined to collapse. The management is not running things in a natural or fair way.\n\nThis captures the essence of your frustration with Snapchat based on the details you provided.",

This lack of accountability puts users, especially minors, at risk.\n\n Privacy Issues\nSnapchat collects sensitive user data, including location, contacts, and usage habits.

      "# Post ID wf9nys: IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO BITMOJI/SNAP INC. with +18 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-08-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitmoji/comments/wf9nys/important_message_to_bitmojisnap_inc/)\nHey y’all, I am a user of Bitmoji, and I have been using that app for a very long time now, but there are important things I gotta get off my chest! First of all, besides just piercings, please add new jewelry such as necklaces (especially one with a cross on it, because so many people around the world, including me, are Christians, and we worship God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit) and bracelets, there can’t just be random face piercings! Second, please add braces and misaligned teeth (especially tooth gaps) because there are especially so many middle schoolers who have braces, and there are people who have misaligned teeth. Third, why don’t you add some new hairstyles, especially medium-length hairstyles because a lot of girls cannot even find their real hairstyles on your own app, I mean, there aren’t enough options, and there needs to be a wider variety of hairstyles because so many people have downloaded your own app. Fourth, please add some new clothing, especially clothing from Vineyard Vines, Lululemon, Lilly Pulitzer, Southern Marsh, Simply Southern, etc., also the 4th of July was a month ago, and y’all were supposed to add American-themed options for our Bitmojis, but y’all did not listen to us because I bet y’all just couldn’t get over with Pride Month because you think that there are way more genders than just male and female, whereas there are only two genders created by God, and y’all need to add some more flannel shirts, along with sports jerseys (Football, basketball, baseball, softball, cheerleader outfits, etc.) more suits for guys & more dresses for girls (especially whenever they have homecoming, winter formals, or even prom), and add some swimsuits/bathing suits, plus there’s more variety out in the world of fashion than just Black Lives Matter BS, especially clothing, plus BLM and Antifa are corrupt organizations that are about to become a thing of the past, y’all need to admit that there’s many preppy people all over the world! Fifth, there are only just 3 options for lips, why not add some more options, even just 6 options is more than just 3, also, why don’t y’all add some abs for our Bitmojis because so many people hit the gym all the time, add some more body types like pregnant women, Cellulite (which is very common in women), etc. because there are more than just 6 body types in the world, and why don’t y’all add some muscles to our Bitmojis, y’all can’t have just weak Bitmojis, also why not add some birth marks so that we can know what age the Bitmoji is! Sixth and final, on many stickers celebrating Holidays, y’all don’t even include Christian Stickers like for example, many people say “Merry Christmas” & admit that Jesus Christ was born on Christmas Day, but y’all just say “Happy Holidays” & only care about a sticker with presents under the tree just because y’all don’t even care about God like we do, y’all care so much about Muslim Holidays, Pride Month, Jewish Holidays, so many other religions and even irreligious/atheist/agnostic stickers, so why not add some Christian Bitmoji stickers, also for Easter, the only Easter-related thing y’all care about is the Easter Bunny who gives you candy, whereas Easter was the Resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and the lack of Christian-themed Bitmoji Stickers make a lot of Christians really mad and angry, including me!\n\nI hope y’all understand what I just said, now read this review, and then improve on your customization options, you have made so many people including me angry, Bitmoji!\n\n## Comment ID ilp8uh9 with +7 score by [(p4stelisqt, Reddit, 2022-08-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitmoji/comments/wf9nys/important_message_to_bitmojisnap_inc/ilp8uh9/) (in reply to ID wf9nys):\nbro what 💀\n\n## Comment ID iz8fyil with +7 score by [(deletus_my_fetus, Reddit, 2022-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitmoji/comments/wf9nys/important_message_to_bitmojisnap_inc/iz8fyil/) (in reply to ID wf9nys):\nI agree that there should be more options for customization…\n\nBut why are you coming at it from the angle of “I’m Christian, so you must do everything exactly how I want it 😡”.

Those going into the office will have an advantage in accelerating their career and over time others will opt in to returning to the office to compete or they fade away. \n\n2.

Flexible hours and wfh days (though generally not full hybrid) were a thing long before COVID. No one’s checking badge logs or yelling at you if you get in at 9:02am. \n\nSo I think a lot of companies are that are going hybrid are really declaring a baseline policy and the reality will vary for individuals. One thing it does is set expectations that you do have to by physically present near an office, vs full remote where you could base in more places. \n\nI interviewed at a small quant hedge fund a while back and talked to someone pretty senior. They had a hybrid policy and he joked that he typically saw the engineers maybe once a week (in a way that he did not have any issue with that). I suspect we’ll see that kind of attitude a lot of places.\n\n#### Comment ID iyblz7v with +9 score by [(closethegatealittle, Reddit, 2022-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z816qv/snap_requiring_employees_to_work_from_office_80/iyblz7v/) (in reply to ID iyazu57):\n>No one’s checking badge logs or yelling at you if you get in at 9:02am.\n\nI know a couple of companies that are threatening action against employees if they don't go into the office by pulling badge reports and doing random walkthroughs.

      "# Post ID 581s3x: Snap Inc. Stock with +57 score by [(whichtochooz, Reddit, 2016-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/581s3x/snap_inc_stock/)\nHello. I have incredible offers from Snap Inc. and Facebook, but I was wondering what the opinions are here. Snap is offering me a boat-load of RSUs (to the liking of ~$450k - backloaded at 10/20/30/40) with a very high salary to boot ($120,350). Facebook's total comp at the current stock price is ~$185k.\n\nMy decision at this point is primarily based on money. I have a Master's in AI, and the teams I'll be joining at both companies are both equally interesting to me. However, I'm having trouble determining how to value Snap's stock. There are several news articles claiming they plan on an IPO in March 2017 at $25 billion. The RSU's they're offering are based on the current valuation of ~16-18 billion, so I could potentially see closer to ~$800k in stock from Snap.\n\nNeedless to say, I'm very excited about potentially being able to acquire so much money in such a short period of time, but I'm having trouble finding information online about pre-IPO stock and what it's worth (assuming the company plans to IPO very soon).\n\n\n## Comment ID d8wsbfn with +41 score by [(temp20312414, Reddit, 2016-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/581s3x/snap_inc_stock/d8wsbfn/) (in reply to ID 581s3x):\nCongrats on your offers! One thing to remember is that Snap actually issues the stock the month that you join, so if you're joining after it ipos, you'll be receiving that much money. But otherwise, there will be a lot of fluctuation once it ipos so you could see its valuation between $20-30 billion. Also, there is not guarantee of it ipoing even though they have recently filed for ipo. If the market suddenly tanks then they will likely pull out of the filing. It seems like the market is doing decently right now so most likely this won't be an issue. If I were you and solely balancing the scales on money, then I would go to snap as you could be making between 500k-1million on the stock in 4 years.\n\n### Comment ID d8x379x with +15 score by [(secretWolfMan, Reddit, 2016-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/581s3x/snap_inc_stock/d8x379x/) (in reply to ID d8wsbfn):\nAgree.

How likely is FB compared to Snapchat (with backloaded stock) to give OP a raise? OP is taking a chance on the company actually IPOing. OP is handcuffed to the company for 4 years.

Snapchat's location in Santa Monica is much nicer than Facebook's in Menlo Park.  There are houses in Los Angeles you could buy in your first year.  This would be pretty much impossible in Menlo Park or anywhere else in the Peninsula.  You could buy in Union City or San Leandro but the quality of life is far better in Los Angeles.\n\nUnlike most \"unicorns\", Snapchat is actually likely to IPO.  I think the offers are equivalent once you price in the risk of a drop in stock value once Snap Inc's financials are exposed to the world.\n\nAnother upside is being part of an engineering team in a company that is up and coming.\n\nBecause you didn't mention it, I assume you don't have kids.  I think you should go for the high risk / high reward option.\n\n### Comment ID d8wz3uo with +15 score by [(dynapro, Reddit, 2016-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/581s3x/snap_inc_stock/d8wz3uo/) (in reply to ID d8wyf83):\nJust a quick correction, Snap is based in Venice Beach.\n\n### Comment ID d8x8l0l with +20 score by [(kebabmybob, Reddit, 2016-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/581s3x/snap_inc_stock/d8x8l0l/) (in reply to ID d8wyf83):\nKek at buying your first year in LA.

Unless it does IPO, those RSU's aren't worth much. Also, take into account that even though it IPO's at 25 billion valuation, your stock options could potentially lose a lot of value by the time they vest (think Twitter). Now, I can't say much about Snap because until they IPO, there is no knowledge about what its financial state really looks like. Facebook on the other hand, is a very solid company, and that stock is not going lower any time soon.\n\n## Comment ID d8ww8gv with +5 score by [(dynapro, Reddit, 2016-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/581s3x/snap_inc_stock/d8ww8gv/) (in reply to ID 581s3x):\nKeep in mind 4 years is a pretty long time frame in tech, and a lot of things can change in that time. The Snap offer is higher risk and higher reward, but I think in this case, the reward justifies the risk. Even if you only stay at Snap for two years, and Snap IPOs at only around 16-18 billion, you'll still make the same as if you were at Facebook. If Snap does really well in the market, you'll make way more.\n\n## Comment ID d8xe2fv with +4 score by [(clutchest_nugget, Reddit, 2016-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/581s3x/snap_inc_stock/d8xe2fv/) (in reply to ID 581s3x):\nI must say, I live in Venice, right near Snap HQ.

Probably.  But is it public yet?  Nope.  Therefore the value is $0.\n\nThey could also get bought out which will dilute the value of your shares significantly.    They could IPO and your stock could tank when everyone realizes the idea is stupid and shouldn't be worth that much.\n\nOr, the founders, being the well-known pricks that they are, could pull a Zynga and dilute the values of your shares or straight up take them back.  They will do whatever their investors tell them to.  They don't give two flying fucks about anyone other than the investors and themselves.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that the Snap offer is way riskier.  Proceed with caution.\n\n### Comment ID d8y1rsn with +2 score by [(ironichaos, Reddit, 2016-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/581s3x/snap_inc_stock/d8y1rsn/) (in reply to ID d8xfbux):\nMan no wonder Zynga went down hill, I never knew they pulled that.",

(Snapchat) as the final step in the recruiting phase.  They insist that all candidates must complete the assignment. And they have insisted the assignment be completed as soon as possible.\n\n  \nThe assignment is quite involved, and will take 3-4 days or more to complete.  In addition, I have been asked to sign a \"**SNAP INC. SUBMISSION RELEASE**\".   This agreement makes it clear that all ideas or pitches submitted  become the exclusive property of Snap.\n\n  \nSome excerpts of clauses include:\n\n  \n\"You acknowledge and agree that all Material will be the sole and exclusive property of Snap Inc.,\n\nand you understand that you will have no right to use the Material. You agree to irrevocably and\n\nunconditionally assign to Snap Inc. all right, title, and interest worldwide in and to the Material,\n\nalthough you acknowledge that Snap Inc. is not admitting that the Material is protected by\n\nintellectual property law, including copyright, trademark, patent, or trade secret law. If any\n\nintellectual property rights in the Material exist and cannot (as a matter of law) be assigned by you\n\nto Snap Inc., then you unconditionally and irrevocably waive the enforcement of such rights and all\n\nclaims and causes of action of any kind against Snap Inc.\"\n\n\n\n  \n5. You acknowledge and agree that Snap Inc. is not, and will not be, under any obligation with\n\nrespect to the Material, including to pay you any compensation or give you any credit, unless\n\nspecifically stated in a signed agreement executed after this Release.\n\n\n\n6. You agree that this Release applies equally to any other material, idea, concept, or other property\n\n(in any form whatsoever) that you may submit, or have submitted, to Snap Inc. before, on or after\n\nthe date of this Release.\n\n=======================================\n\n  \nI have had bad experiences in the past where I work on these \"mock pitches\"/ consulting assignments only not be hired or ghosted entirely by the recruiting company.  I was willing to make an exception for SNAP, but on seeing the details of the pitch, and in particular, on seeing the comprehensiveness of the \"Submission Release\" agreement,  I am concerned, as these appear to be major red flags.\n\n  \nDo people have experience with SNAP or  other companies in similar scenarios?  \n\n  \nHow do you assess the situation?\n\n  \nIs this a real job or just a phishing expedition to get free consulting labor?\n\n  \nWhat is your recommendation ---  sign the Submission Release agreement and submit the pitch or withdraw from the recruitment process?\n\n  \nThanks so much!\n\n\n\n## Comment ID l4fw5y0 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-05-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1cu2jfn/mock_pitch_for_snap_real_job_or_free_consulting/l4fw5y0/) (in reply to ID 1cu2jfn):\n>How do you assess the situation?\n\n1. Never sign anything unless you're getting paid.\n2. Don't ever agree to allow your intellectual property to be owned by someone else, especially when you're not getting paid.\n\nYou probably know this. But in case you need to hear it out loud or from a third party: don't walk, run. Don't even try and negotiate out the obviously-delusional clauses from their agreement. The mere fact they have the cheek to ask you to work for free and use your ideas without pay tells you everything you need to know about these chucklefucks. Most intellectual property thieves are at least smart enough to hide their intentions. But these clowns have shouted it from the rooftops. That's a hard no.",

How much is the average/normal compensation package that Snapchat offers for new graduates? I've looked on Glassdoor, which lists 132K base, but the statistics don't discriminate between different experience levels (e.g. new grad vs 4 years).\n\n2. How likely is Snapchat to increase from their initial offer? Has anyone had any anecdotal experience with negotiating with them?\n\n3. Any advice on negotiating?

Plus, many clients see the site as visually or functionally done and thus don't see the need for optimization.\n\nAnother common argument I have heard recently has been \"There's enough speed/space/memory/bandwidth that we don't need to worry about optimizing much anymore.\"  If a web page takes 50 MB to download, or the tab takes 1 GB of memory, or a simple calculator app for mobile is 20MB in size, then something is clearly wrong.\n\n### Comment ID d80d7xo with +7 score by [(tms10000, Reddit, 2016-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/548no9/snapchat_is_now_called_snap_inc_and_will_sell_its/d80d7xo/) (in reply to ID d8030d2):\nYour first mistake is to be reading Businessinsider\n\n## Comment ID d7zupfw with +88 score by [(None, Reddit, 2016-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/548no9/snapchat_is_now_called_snap_inc_and_will_sell_its/d7zupfw/) (in reply to ID 548no9):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID d7zvkmf with +44 score by [(JillyBeef, Reddit, 2016-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/548no9/snapchat_is_now_called_snap_inc_and_will_sell_its/d7zvkmf/) (in reply to ID d7zupfw):\nMaybe Google glass was the lightning rod for that particular shitstorm?

It also takes away the need for someone to constantly pull their phone out or stick it in your face while still being able to obsess over Snapping.\n\n#### Comment ID d80czit with +7 score by [(tyvmsongs, Reddit, 2016-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/548no9/snapchat_is_now_called_snap_inc_and_will_sell_its/d80czit/) (in reply to ID d8000yw):\nI don't know, looks very in with fashion today and by making them playful stylish vs actually attempting to be stylish and failing. like with Google Glass is a big difference.

I really appreciate the detailed answer. I looked on Glassdoor and somehow got the perception the interviews weren’t so hard but seems that’s not the case. I’m good with easy’s, decent with mediums, and abysmal on hards(I can come up with a solution sometimes but often never code it in time), all depending on the topic also.

Recent layoffs within the company have been mishandled, resulting in insufficient support for mental health and a decrease in morale. Despite these challenges, the CEO and senior executives remain focused on Snap's potential to compete with TikTok and Meta. However, it must be acknowledged that the product and technology have significant flaws. Instead of investing in improving the advertising platform and rectifying these issues, which are pivotal in driving 95% of the company's revenue, the CEO prioritises funding a small yellow drone with a mere two-minute battery life. Additionally, Snap creators are compensated more generously than those on other platforms, possibly to create a false sense of community or activity.",

Launch Innovative Virtual Resource to Educate Teens About Online Harms on 2024-10-01](https://www.dhs.gov/hsi/news/2024/10/01/dhs-know2protect-and-snap-inc-launch-innovative-virtual-resource-educate-teens)\nWASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Know2Protect campaign has collaborated with Snap Inc. to introduce today the Know2Protect Snapchat Lens, an innovative virtual prevention tool aimed at helping teens identify and navigate online risks.\n\nImage\n\nKnow2Protect is the first federal campaign dedicated to preventing and educating about online child safety risks and has partnered with Snap Inc. to help spread awareness to one of the campaign’s key audiences: teens. Snapchat — Snap Inc.’s multimedia messaging platform — resonates strongly with teens and will provide an additional avenue for the campaign to bring important online safety information to this community directly.\n\n“The dangerous reality is that as safety protocols are put in place to protect children online, predators are already working to find ways around them,” said DHS Cyber Crimes Center Deputy Assistant Director Mike Prado. “Collaborative tools, like the one we are announcing today, help empower teens and young people with the information they need to stay one step ahead.”\n\nThe Snapchat Lens is designed to engage teens through a fun and interactive quiz format that poses true-false questions about online safety and how to prevent potential online harms. Snapchatters will be able to apply real-time effects and animations to their videos, transforming the learning experience into an entertaining adventure.\n\nBy leveraging Snapchat’s interactive features, the Know2Protect campaign aims to create memorable experiences that promote awareness of online risks.\n\n“Snap is honored to be a founding member of Know2Protect — an important initiative to educate teens and adults about online child exploitation,” said Snap Inc.’s Global Head of Platform Security Jacqueline Beauchere. “We are excited to see the launch of this engaging Lens on our platform, which will continue to amplify the campaign's message across the country.”\n\nIn addition to the Know2Protect lens, Snap Inc. amplified the campaign’s reach through donated paid media, by promoting the lens on Snapchat. The lens will also be promoted on Know2Protect’s owned social media channels. Additionally, Snap is conducting ongoing research with teens aged 13 to 17 and young adults aged 18 to 24 in the United States about the various dimensions of child sexual exploitation and abuse online, which will help to further inform the campaign.\n\n“The Know2Protect Snapchat Lens equips teens with important information about online safety in an interactive way. We encourage parents and trusted adults to also check it out. This feature can jumpstart sometimes difficult but necessary conversations with teens about online safety,” said Know2Protect Campaign Director Kate Kennedy.\n\nTo access the free Know2Protect Snapchat Lens:\n\nOpen the Lens Explorer in Snapchat.\n\nUse the search icon when the carousel is active and type in Know2Protect.\n\nSwipe on the carousel and tap the Know2Protect lens.\n\nFor more information visit https://help.snapchat.com, Know2Protect.gov or @Know2Protect on Instagram, Facebook and X.",

      "# [New Mexico’s attorney general files a suit saying Snapchat allows child sexual extortion by BARBARA ORTUTAY, the internet twitter mailto, apnews.com, barbara-ortutay on 2024-09-05](https://apnews.com/article/new-mexico-snapchat-attorney-general-sextortion-teens-1a1c4c856a24d15631f26bb69e0f4c74)\nAP Technology Writer (AP) — New Mexico’s attorney general has filed a lawsuit against the company behind Snapchat, alleging that site’s design and policies foster the sharing of child sexual abuse material and facilitate child sexual exploitation.\n\nAttorney General Raúl Torrez filed the lawsuit against Snap Inc. Thursday in state court in Santa Fe. In addition to sexual abuse, the lawsuit claims the company also openly promotes child trafficking, drugs and guns.\n\nLast December, Torrez filed a similar lawsuit against Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, saying it allows predators to trade child sexual abuse material and solicit minors for sex on its platforms. That suit is still pending.\n\nSnap’s “harmful design features create an environment where predators can easily target children through sextortion schemes and other forms of sexual abuse,” Torrez said in a statement. Sexual extortion, or sextortion, involves persuading a person to send explicit photos online and then threatening to make the images public unless the victim pays money or engages in sexual favors.\n\n“Snap has misled users into believing that photos and videos sent on their platform will disappear, but predators can permanently capture this content and they have created a virtual yearbook of child sexual images that are traded, sold, and stored indefinitely,” Torrez said.\n\nIn a statement, Snap said it shares Torrez’s and the public’s concerns about the online safety of young people.\n\n“We understand that online threats continue to evolve and we will continue to work diligently to address these critical issues,” the company based in Santa Monica, California, said. “We have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in our trust and safety teams over the past several years, and designed our service to promote online safety by moderating content and enabling direct messaging with close friends and family.”\n\nAccording to the complaint, minors report having more online sexual interactions on Snapchat than any other platform, and more sex trafficking victims are recruited on Snapchat than on any other platform.\n\nPrior to the lawsuit, New Mexico conducted a monthslong undercover investigation into child sexual abuse images on Snapchat. According to Torrez’s statement, the investigation revealed a “vast network of dark web sites dedicated to sharing stolen, non-consensual sexual images from Snap,” finding more than 10,000 records related to Snap and child sexual abuse material in the last year. This included information related to minors younger than 13 being sexually assaulted.\n\nAs part of the undercover investigation, the New Mexico department of justice set up a decoy Snapchat account for a 14-year-old named Heather, who found and exchanged messages with accounts with names like “child.rape” and “pedo_lover10.”\n\nSnapchat, the lawsuit alleges, “was by far the largest source of images and videos among the dark web sites investigated.” Investigators also found Snapchat accounts that openly circulated and sold child abuse images directly on the platform.",

Here's How I See It Now. by Will Healy, www.facebook.com on 2024-09-01](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/01/i-wrong-snap-stock-2022-heres-how-i-see-it-now/)\nWhen it comes to investing mistakes, one of the costliest was underestimating the severity of the 2022 bear market. That led me to make bad bullish calls on some stocks that had lost more than half their value -- and kept falling.\n\nOne of those stocks was Snap, Inc. (SNAP 4.42%). It had lost more than half of its value, and when it came to Snap stock in the next five years, I speculated that it would beat the S&P 500. Unfortunately, nearly 2.5 years later, the Snapchat parent has lost approximately 65% of its value since that time, making it unlikely to beat the market by April 2027.\n\nNonetheless, this lousy call on the social media stock offers lessons on investing in general, and on investing in Snap stock if I choose to do so.\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\nAs for what went wrong, probably the biggest mistake was underestimating the severity of the 2022 bear market. When I made this call in April 2022, stocks were trending downward, but the belief seemed to be that it was a healthy pullback after a massive bull run in 2021. This led investors like myself to make calls on stocks down more than 50% and, unfortunately, on track to lose more.\n\nAdmittedly, investors can earn huge returns on big moves. However, in another sense, it makes investing more difficult amid the rising volatility.\n\nAs for Snap stock at the time, I thought it had turned a corner. After the industry behemoth Meta Platforms (META -0.64%) profited from copying Snap's innovations, Snap learned to better leverage the power of advertising.\n\nAdditionally, Snap was gaining an increasing following with people over 25 years old, a necessary demographic to capture if it wanted to grow. Such improvements made me feel I could ignore ongoing losses and an approximate price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 12.\n\nUnfortunately, the 2022 bear market also led to a decline in advertising revenue. Since ad giants like Google's parent Alphabet reported only single-digit increases in ad revenue at the time, it was unlikely that Snap would prosper in that environment, and indeed, the stock fell further.\n\nSnap stock going forward\n\nThe question now is whether I would speculate that Snap stock will beat the market over the next five years beginning today. The truth is, I would not make such a claim now, and while such a surge is not impossible, it looks increasingly unlikely.\n\nSnap stock continued falling in 2022, and by the low point of the bear market in late 2022, it had reached a price comparable to where it trades today.\n\nDespite Snap's lower price, I hesitate to make a bullish call, since its net losses continue to this day. Also, its $2.4 billion in revenue for the first half of 2024 is not far above the $2.2 billion in revenue it earned at the same point in 2022.\n\nConsidering the company's relatively small market cap of $15 billion, it should grow more easily than Meta, which now claims a $1.3 trillion market cap. However, Meta grew its revenue 35% over the same two-year timeframe, compared to just 12% for Snap. That's a factor that's likely to deter growth investors from buying the stock.\n\nMoreover, Snap should have a valuation edge, since its P/S ratio of 3 is close to all-time lows and far below Meta at 9 times sales. Nonetheless, the slower revenue growth and ongoing losses appear to negate that advantage.\n\nLessons on my Snap stock misstep\n\nUltimately, the wrong call I made on Snap and other stocks has changed how I look at investing in bull markets that are possibly turning negative. Probably the biggest lesson is that investors never know when a bottom will come. While I did not technically call a bottom on Snap in April 2022, I thought it was much closer than it actually was.\n\nSecond, I did not give enough thought to how Snap might perform in a severe downturn. I knew it had virtually no chance of unseating Meta in the social media space. Thus, I should have known it would see the negative effects of a downturn much faster and recover more slowly when conditions finally improved.\n\nIn fact, Snap's stock price has yet to recover. For that and other reasons, I do not think it will beat the market over the next five years. Until it can accelerate its revenue growth, investors are likely best off taking speculative positions in this stock, if they choose to buy at all.",
      "# [I followed Snap Inc. CEO Evan Spiegel's morning routine for a week. I finally understand the appeal of waking up early. by Mykenna Maniece on 2024-05-08](https://www.businessinsider.com/evan-spiegel-snap-ceo-morning-routine-review-2024-5)\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAfter failing to replicate the routine of Apple CEO Tim Cook, I was ready to try something new.\n\nI tried following the morning routine of Snap Inc. CEO Evan Spiegel.\n\nI'm starting to see the appeal of waking up early, but 5 a.m. is still unrealistic.\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.

The reality, though, is a bit bleak: Gen Z is lonely, drinking less, and splurging more on their groceries than nights out.\n\nHowever, after years of watching my favorite content creators share what it's like to \"get their lives together\" in their late 20s and early 30s, I'm inclined to think Gen Z might be onto something.\n\nCall us overachievers or flat-out boring, but maybe we don't want to wait until we're 30 to build consistent, healthy routines we're happy with — I know I don't.\n\nSo, earlier this year, I made it my personal mission to curate an effective morning routine and started researching the special group of humans who seem innately more prepared to start their days than the rest of us: CEOs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter some mixed results copying Apple CEO Tim Cook's morning routine for a week, I was determined to try something new.\n\nEnter Snap Inc. CEO Evan Spiegel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpiegel wakes up at 5 a.m. to check Snap, read his emails, and drink a double espresso before working out or meditating.\n\nIdeally, my morning routine would consist of a workout, breakfast, reading, and ample time for getting dressed and doing my hair and makeup. Luckily, I found that Snap Inc. CEO Evan Spiegel likes the same things as me (minus the hair and makeup).\n\nAt 33, Spiegel is one of the youngest billionaires in the world with a net worth of $3.9 billion, per Forbes. He wakes up at 5 a.m. to check his app, read emails, and work out or meditate. Then, he showers, gets ready, and reads the news before having breakfast with his wife, Miranda Kerr, and their children at their mansion in Brentwood, California.\n\nHis routine aligns with what I'm looking for, and thanks to my previous experience with Cook's routine — which involved waking up at 4:45 a.m., strength training, and coffee — I knew what it would take to prepare for such an early start to the day.\n\nHere's how it went.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI exceeded my expectations and was wide awake by 5:30 a.m. on Monday.\n\nOK, technically, it was 5:32 a.m., but give a girl some credit.\n\nIn 2018, Spiegel said in an interview that appeared in the Entrepreneurship Handbook that he likes to wake up early to give himself some alone time.\n\n\"I get up really early, because that's the only time that's 'Evan Time' for me, when people aren't really awake yet. I get a couple hours between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m. to do whatever I wanna do,\" he said.\n\nSo, to prepare, I went to bed at 10:30 p.m. and even agreed to sacrifice my side of the bed for the week so I could more easily get to the alarm I share with my boyfriend.\n\nI woke up right on time at 5 a.m. and redownloaded the Snap app since I haven't used it in years (sorry, Evan), but I accidentally \"blinked\" and woke up again at 5:32 a.m., this time wide awake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce I was out of bed, it was time to make coffee and work out.\n\nI said a small thank you to the earlier version of me who had picked workout clothes the night before. I got dressed, put in my contacts, and made a cup of coffee.\n\nSnap told BI that Spiegel likes to check the app and his email and drink a double espresso when he wakes up. Then, he'll exercise at the gym for 45 minutes or meditate.\n\nI'm still a \"coffee with my creamer\" kind of girl, so I sipped my usual cup of coffee and checked my email and the updated Snap interface before scrolling through YouTube for a workout video.\n\nI followed a Chloe Ting video that focused on arms, and afterward, I realized it felt really good to finish a workout so early in the morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by Spiegel's skincare must-have.\n\nThen, it was time to shower and try the part of Spiegel's routine I was most excited about: his face wash. Spiegel has been married to Kerr, a model and the founder of Kora Organics, since 2017, and he uses the brand's turmeric brightening and exfoliating mask.\n\n\"He doesn't use it as an actual mask; he keeps it in the shower and uses it as an exfoliant,\" Kerr told New Beauty in 2019.\n\n\"What he loves about it is that it has peppermint oil in it, so it's so invigorating. He says he can't be without it because it's his little boost of aromatherapy in the morning! It gives him energy!\" she added.\n\nAccording to Snap, he still uses it, so I wanted to see if it was worth the hype. I bought a 1-ounce tube, which cost $20.\n\nFirst impressions: Wow, they weren't kidding — the peppermint is strong.\n\nI loved the feel of the exfoliating particles and how smooth my skin felt afterward. The best way to describe the experience was as if the sensation of using mouthwash was on my face, which doesn't sound pleasant, but I found it to be very enjoyable and, yes, \"invigorating.\"\n\nMy only issue with Spiegel's routine thus far was that he reportedly allots a mere 15 minutes to get ready after his shower.\n\nI, meanwhile, am more of a \"Vogue's Beauty Secrets\" six-step skincare routine, try on a bunch of outfits, perform a mini concert while doing my hair, and listen to a podcast while doing my makeup kind of gal. So, 15 minutes? Couldn't be me.\n\nBut with ample time to spare after such an early start, I realized I didn't have to rush to complete all those steps immediately; I could sit, have breakfast, and even knock out some chores before going back to hair and makeup.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWaking up so early gave me time to finish my self-care routine, get ahead on chores, and read before work.\n\nI don't know if it was the bright sun shining through my windows or the earlier dose of caffeine, but after I ate my breakfast, I went on a superwoman cleaning spree around my apartment, washing dishes, starting a couple of loads of laundry, and wiping down my glass coffee table.\n\nAnd I still had time to finish getting ready and read a Wall Street Journal article before clocking into work at 9 a.m.\n\nA 10/10 morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, I maintained my momentum and didn't feel rushed at all, even though I had to commute.\n\nDay two also started strong.\n\nI woke up at 5 a.m. and was out of bed by 5:30 a.m. to get dressed and head to my living room for another workout.\n\nI made myself a cup of coffee and took a picture of the early moments of the sunrise over New York City before doing a Pilates workout and repeating one of the same Chloe Ting arm workouts from Monday. After that, I finished my coffee while watching a vlog before moving on to the rest of my routine.\n\nThanks to my early start, I had enough time to try on a few outfits, make my lunch, pack my work bag, and toast a bagel for breakfast without rushing, which is simply unheard of in my life.\n\nI was out of my apartment by 8 a.m. and clocked in at 8:45 a.m., feeling incredibly satisfied. My one shortcoming of the morning was forgetting to read, but a win is a win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Wednesday, I tried Kriya meditation for the first time. Spiegel has called it \"life-changing.\"\n\nWednesday was the first time I struggled to wake up on time. Despite taking my daily Snap at 5:11 a.m., I didn't get out of bed until 5:45 a.m. Given how sore I felt from working out the past two days, I decided Wednesday would be the perfect day to try Spiegel's other morning activity: Kriya meditation.\n\nSpiegel told Vogue Australia in 2022 that his wife got him \"hooked on Kriya meditation.\"\n\n\"On a good day, I can get 45 minutes in the morning to meditate, which is life-changing,\" he added.\n\nIn 2020, BI reported on the extensive benefits of meditation including better focus and concentration, reduced stress levels, and improved self-esteem and self-awareness.\n\nOn YouTube, I found a video entitled \"Isha Kriya: A Guided Meditation For Health And Wellbeing | 15-Minutes\" by the channel Sadhguru.\n\n\"Daily practice of Isha Kriya will bring health, dynamism, prosperity, and wellbeing. It is a powerful tool to cope with the hectic pace of modern life and empowers people to experience their lives to the fullest potential,\" the video displayed on the screen.\n\nFrom my understanding after watching the video, one of the main features of Isha Kriya meditation is the practice of breathing while thinking, \"I am not the body,\" and exhaling with the thought, \"I am not even my mind.\"\n\nI don't know if it's possible to be \"bad\" at meditating, but that's certainly what it felt like to me — a first-timer and chronic over-thinker.\n\nWhile trying to focus on the space between my eyebrows and to think only of how \"I am not my body,\" I was instead thinking about all the things I had planned for the day, how I would write about the experience, and how long it'd been since I started.\n\nAlthough I wouldn't call this initial attempt at meditation successful, I think trying it was useful in helping me identify a weakness that makes it challenging to stay in the present.\n\nI finished the meditation and proceeded with the rest of the routine, arriving at my office in time to grab a coffee and snack and read a bit of a WSJ article.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI started Thursday slow but still made time for a quick workout and breakfast.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't feel well when I woke up, so I pushed off working out until around 7 a.m. I used the Kora Organics again in the shower before getting dressed to work from home. Rather than my usual hair and makeup routine, I skipped both, favoring a bun and a fresh face since I had no intention of leaving my apartment.\n\nI had a bagel and coffee for breakfast and read some of Business Insider's latest stories before clocking in at 9 a.m.\n\nThe morning was a much more condensed attempt at Spiegel's routine, but I could truly feel the difference an adjusted sleep schedule makes. All week, I'd been going to sleep by 10:30 p.m. not by sheer force, but because I was naturally feeling tired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriday was the least productive day, but Spiegel's definitely onto something with \"Evan Time.\"\n\nOn Friday, I wasn't feeling well again, so I got up around 7 a.m. and tried to do a quick five minutes of meditation.\n\nAlthough this wasn't the routine I aimed for, I could still appreciate the impact of the little shifts I'd made in my mentality. Before this, I would've stayed in bed till 8-8:30 a.m. and just rolled from my bed to my laptop for work at 9 a.m., but with my improved sleep schedule and more disciplined mindset, I was able to get up an hour earlier and take some time for myself before jumping into the demands of the day, which felt like a huge win.\n\nSo, while the only Spiegel-related highlight of my morning was the face wash, I was optimistic about my ability to sustain these efforts going forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a week of living like Evan Spiegel, I finally understand the appeal of waking up early.\n\nIn the weeks since I attempted to copy Spiegel's routine, I've continued using the face wash, sleeping by 10:30 p.m. and waking up by 7 a.m. at the latest, and I'm happy with my progress.\n\nIt's a stark contrast to how exhausted I felt after finishing Tim Cook's routine, which surprised me since both men wake up incredibly early.\n\nLooking back, it's easy to see how important timing was in the outcome of both routines. When I completed Cook's routine, daylight-saving time had just started, causing me to lose an hour of sleep; my body never had a chance to adjust properly before being thrown into a completely new routine. By comparison, trying Spiegel's routine in mid-April allowed me to adjust and wake up shortly before sunrise.\n\nWaking up at 5 a.m. is still unnecessary for my lifestyle, but I think the best part of trying a routine like this again has been learning how to be more disciplined. Of course, it would be easy to lay in bed for an extra 15 minutes — and trust me, sometimes I do — but if I know that getting out of bed will make me less rushed and stressed, what's the point in continuing to self-sabotage?\n\nI've by no means mastered my mornings, but I think I've gotten one step closer to figuring out the puzzle, and that's good enough for now.\n\nRead next\n\nAdvertisement",

Snap Inc., which was first filed in October 2022. In all but two cases, the child died after ingesting the drugs allegedly obtained through Snapchat.\n\nSnap previously attempted to get the lawsuit dismissed back in October, but Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lawrence P. Riff ruled Tuesday that the parents' lawsuit may continue to trial.\n\nIn his ruling, the judge overruled Snap's objections to 12 of 16 claims in the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that \"Snap and Snapchat's role in illicit drug sales to teens was the foreseeable result of the designs, structures, and policies Snap chose to implement to increase its revenues,\" according to court filings shared by the Social Media Victims Law Center, which is representing the families.\n\nSome of Snapchat's features that set it apart from other apps -- like automatically deleted messages, geolocation functionality and the My Eyes Only privacy feature -- make illegal activities harder to track and are especially attractive to drug dealers, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nTelevision host Dr. Laura Berman and her husband Sam Chapman's son Sammy was 16 years old and a junior in high school when he died in 2021 after overdosing on a fentanyl-laced pill from a person he allegedly met on Snapchat, according to Chapman and Berman.\n\n\"He did not mean to take fentanyl. He did not want to take fentanyl,\" Berman, whose family is part of the lawsuit, told ABC News in December. \"But what he took was counterfeit, and it was fentanyl.\"\n\nAmy Neville, the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, told \"Good Morning America\" in October that her son Alexander was 14 years old and preparing for his freshman year of high school when he died in 2020 after taking a fentanyl-laced oxycodone pill that Neville said he allegedly obtained from a person he met on Snapchat.\n\n\"Kids are losing their lives, and they swept it under the rug. They had their chance to do the right thing, and they chose profits over people,\" Neville told \"GMA,\" referring to Snapchat. \"The way that we are going to bring Snapchat and other social media companies to the table is through lawsuits and legislation. That is plain and simple.\"\n\nIn response to the judge's ruling allowing the lawsuit to move forward, Ashley Adams, a spokeswoman for Snap Inc., told \"GMA\" the social media company will \"continue to defend\" itself in court.\n\n\"The fentanyl epidemic has taken the lives of too many people and we have deep empathy for families who have suffered unimaginable losses,\" Adams said in a statement. \"At Snap, we are working diligently to stop drug dealers from abusing our platform, and deploy technologies to proactively identify and shut down dealers, support law enforcement efforts to help bring dealers to justice, and educate our community and the general public about the dangers of fentanyl.\"\n\nAdams continued, \"While we are committed to advancing our efforts to stop drug dealers from engaging in illegal activity on Snapchat, we believe the plaintiffs' allegations are both legally and factually flawed and will continue to defend that position in court.\"\n\nSnap Inc. has said previously that the company uses \"cutting-edge technology\" in trying to keep users safe. The company has also pointed to its work supporting law enforcement investigations into drug dealers, and its work creating a Family Center to help provide parents with more visibility into their kids' actions on Snapchat.\n\nMatthew P. Bergman, the attorney for the families, said that Tuesday's ruling marks a \"first\" in the effort to \"hold social media companies accountable.\"\n\n\"Today's ruling marks the first time a court has allowed parents to hold social media companies accountable for facilitating the sale of deadly drugs,\" Berman said in a statement Tuesday. \"Fentanyl is the largest killer of kids under 18 and social media plays a huge role the deadly drug sales that have resulted in a 350% increase in teen deaths over the past three years.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Parents who lost children to fentanyl poisoning will now be able to move forward with lawsuit, uncover evidence of Snapchat's contribution to illegal drug sales and by holding Snap legally accountable spare other families the unspeakable grief they experience every day.\"",

Snap operates primarily in North America and Europe, offering a visual messaging application called Snapchat, which allows users to communicate through short videos and images. The company also produces Spectacles, eyewear that connects with Snapchat to capture photos and videos from a human perspective, and various advertising products, including AR ads and Snap ads [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNAP/).\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, Snap Inc. employs approximately 5,289 full-time employees and has a market capitalization of around $18.055 billion [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNAP/).

Despite these losses, Snap's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is currently at 3.43, which is relatively low compared to its historical values and suggests potential for growth if revenue can be increased [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNAP/).\n\n## Recent Developments\n### Partnerships and Collaborations\nSnap Inc. has recently expanded its strategic partnership with Google Cloud to enhance its My AI chatbot, leveraging generative AI capabilities to improve user engagement. This partnership has reportedly led to a 2.5x increase in engagement with the My AI feature since the integration of Google Cloud's Gemini technology [(Google Cloud, 2024)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/snap-inc-partners-with-google-cloud-to-power-multi-modal-generative-ai-experiences-within-its-my-ai-chatbot-302256630.html).\n\nAdditionally, Snap has collaborated with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to launch the Know2Protect Snapchat Lens, aimed at educating teens about online safety risks.

The lawsuit claims that Snap's features make it easier for predators to target minors and that the company has not done enough to protect its users from these risks [(AP News, 2024)](https://apnews.com/article/new-mexico-snapchat-attorney-general-sextortion-teens-1a1c4c856a24d15631f26bb69e0f4c74). Furthermore, a separate lawsuit involving families of children who allegedly obtained illegal drugs through Snapchat has been allowed to proceed, highlighting ongoing concerns about the platform's role in facilitating harmful activities [(ABC News, 2024)](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/News/families-lawsuit-snapchat-alleging-platform-enables-drug-dealers/story?id=106076434).\n\n## Product Overview\nSnapchat, Snap Inc.'s flagship product, is a multimedia messaging platform that allows users to send photos and videos that disappear after being viewed.
