The company is headquartered in Santa Monica, California. Originally named Snapchat Inc., it rebranded to Snap Inc. on September 24, 2016, to reflect its broader product offerings, which include Spectacles and Bitmoji [(Wikimedia, 2016)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.).\n\nSnap Inc. is primarily known for its flagship product, Snapchat, a multimedia messaging app that allows users to send photos and videos that disappear after being viewed. The company has expanded its offerings to include augmented reality (AR) experiences, creator support programs, and Snapchat for Web, among others [(Snap Inc., 2022)](https://www.snapchat.com/add/itskcheyenne/fVxTgdI6QxCbXXwQcIaI3AAAgaGxodGx3aHNuAYxmnUXNAYxmnUCSAAAAAA).\n\nSnap Inc. primarily targets a younger demographic, with a significant user base of 13-34 year-olds across over 25 countries.

In Q2 2024, Snap reported a 16% growth in lower-funnel direct response revenue [(Snap Inc., 2024)](https://newsroom.snap.com/13-years-at-snap).\n\nSnap Inc. has undergone significant changes over time, including workforce reductions and strategic acquisitions to enhance its technology and product offerings. As of early 2024, the company has approximately 5,000 employees, following layoffs in recent years [(AP News, 2024)](https://apnews.com/article/snapchat-snap-layoffs-tech-b67df4deb437af7fc1612425a379cdd4).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\n- **Evan Spiegel**: Co-founder and CEO of Snap Inc. Spiegel has been instrumental in driving the company's vision and technological advancements.

Murphy plays a crucial role in the technological development and strategic direction of the company.\n\n# News\n\n## Financial Performance and Market Position\n\nSnap Inc. went public in March 2017, raising nearly $30 billion in market capitalization on its first day of trading. However, the company has faced challenges in maintaining its stock price, which fell significantly after disappointing earnings reports in early 2024, leading to a market capitalization of approximately $18 billion, below its IPO level [(Wikimedia, 2016)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.) [(Snap Inc., 2024)](https://newsroom.snap.com/13-years-at-snap).\n\n## Recent Developments and Features\n\n1. **Generative AI Integration**: In September 2024, Snap Inc. announced a partnership with Google Cloud to enhance its My AI chatbot using generative AI technology. This integration aims to improve user engagement and provide innovative features, such as translating images and providing health information about food options [(Google Cloud, 2024)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/snap-inc-partners-with-google-cloud-to-power-multi-modal-generative-ai-experiences-within-its-my-ai-chatbot-302256630.html).\n\n2. **Advertising Innovations**: Snap has been focusing on enhancing its advertising platform by introducing new ad placements like Sponsored Snaps and Promoted Places, which leverage the unique features of Snapchat to drive user engagement and improve advertising effectiveness [(Snap Inc., 2024)](https://newsroom.snap.com/13-years-at-snap).\n\n3. **Safety Initiatives**: In October 2024, Snap collaborated with the Department of Homeland Security to launch the Know2Protect Snapchat Lens, aimed at educating teens about online safety risks through interactive quizzes [(DHS, 2024)](https://www.dhs.gov/hsi/news/2024/10/01/dhs-know2protect-and-snap-inc-launch-innovative-virtual-resource-educate-teens).\n\n## Partnerships and Acquisitions\n\nSnap Inc. has a history of strategic acquisitions to enhance its technology and product offerings. Notable acquisitions include:\n\n- **AddLive** (2014): To develop video chat features.\n- **Looksery** (2015): To create Lenses for the app.\n- **Zenly** (2017): A location-sharing app that has been integrated into Snapchat features [(Wikimedia, 2016)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.).\n\nIn addition, Snap has formed partnerships with various companies, including a recent collaboration with VideoAmp to integrate its advertising inventory into cross-platform planning solutions [(VideoAmp, 2024)](https://videoamp.com/press/videoamp-announces-industry-first-strategic-collaboration-with-snap-inc/).\n\n## User Feedback and Community Sentiment\n\nUser feedback on platforms like Reddit indicates a polarized sentiment towards Snapchat, with some users praising its innovative features while others express frustration over advertisements and app changes. For instance, one user noted, \"Snapchat is a cool app... but it could definitely use more changes,\" highlighting a desire for improvements in user experience [(Snap Inc., 2022)](https://www.snapchat.com/add/itskcheyenne/fVxTgdI6QxCbXXwQcIaI3AAAgaGxodGx3aHNuAYxmnUXNAYxmnUCSAAAAAA).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSnap Inc. continues to evolve its product offerings and advertising strategies in a competitive landscape. With a strong user base and ongoing innovations in generative AI and augmented reality, the company is well-positioned to enhance user engagement and drive revenue growth. However, challenges remain in maintaining stock performance and addressing user concerns regarding advertisements and app functionality. Prospective candidates and investors should consider these factors when evaluating opportunities with Snap Inc.",

But political advertising that appears on Snapchat has to be transparent, lawful, and right for our users.\n\nRequirements\n\nThese Political Advertising Policies apply to all political ads served by Snap, including election-related ads, advocacy ads, and issue ads.\n\nElection-related ads include ads about or paid for by candidates or parties for public office, ballot measures or referendums, political action committees, and ads that urge people to vote or register to vote.\n\nAdvocacy or issue ads are ads concerning issues or organizations that are the subject of debate on a local, national, or global level, or of public importance. Examples include: ads about abortion, immigration, the environment, education, discrimination, and guns.\n\nPolitical advertising must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including all national election and campaign finance laws, copyright law, defamation law, and (where applicable) Federal Election Commission regulations and state or local laws and regulations. Complying with those laws and regulations will be the sole responsibility of the advertiser.\n\nAll political advertising must include a “paid for by” message in the ad that is followed by the name of the paying person or entity. Snap may also require a “paid for by” disclosure on ad content that links to political content, ad content for political merchandise, or in other cases in Snap’s sole discretion. In the United States, electoral ads must state whether or not the ad was authorized by a candidate or organization, and election ads not authorized by the candidate must include contact information for the sponsoring organization. These disclaimers vary by jurisdiction. Advertisers must ensure that each ad complies with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations regarding “paid for by” disclaimers.\n\nLike all ads on Snapchat, political ads must comply with Snap's Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and our Advertising Policies. That means, among other things:\n\nNo content that harasses, intimidates, or threatens.\n\nNo content that is misleading, deceptive, impersonates any person or entity, or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or entity.\n\nNo content that includes synthetic avatars, or visual or audio likenesses of a real person that have been manipulated for false or misleading purposes (whether through generative AI or through deceptive editing).\n\nNo content that violates the publicity, privacy, copyright, or other intellectual property rights of a third party.\n\nNo content that features graphic violence or calls for violence.\n\nWe encourage political advertisers to be positive. But we don't categorically ban “attack” ads; expressing disagreement with or campaigning against a candidate or party is generally permissible if it meets our other guidelines. That said, political ads must not include attacks relating to a candidate's personal life.\n\nIn Canada, Snap does not permit “partisan advertising” or “election advertising” (as defined by the Canada Elections Act, as amended from time to time (the “Act”)) purchased directly or indirectly on behalf of an eligible party, registered association, nomination contestant, potential or actual candidate, or a third party required to register under subsection 349.6(1) or 353(1) of the Act. This may include (without limitation) content that promotes or opposes any of these individuals/groups, or an issue associated with any of those individuals/groups.\n\nIn the US, Snap does not currently permit ads for state or municipal elections or ballot initiatives in Washington state.\n\nSnap's rights\n\nSnap will review political ads on a case-by-case basis. To get started, please fill out our political advertiser form.\n\nWe reserve the right to reject, in our sole discretion, or request modifications to ads that we believe violate the standards listed above or that are otherwise inappropriate. Our discretion will never be exercised with the intent to favor or disfavor any candidate, political view, or political party.\n\nWe also reserve the right to require substantiation of an advertiser's factual claims.\n\nSnap may publicly display and otherwise disclose information relating to political advertising, including ad content, targeting details, delivery, spend, and other campaign information.\n\nPolitical Advertising by Foreign Nationals or Entities\n\nPolitical ads served by Snap may not be paid for directly or indirectly by foreign nationals or entities, as those terms are defined by relevant law -- in other words, by people or entities that aren’t residents of the country where the ad will run. There is a limited exception to this prohibition for political ads targeting any Member State of the European Union (EU), which may be paid for directly or indirectly by entities residing in another EU Member State. Snap does not engage in political activities, nor does it serve as a political consultant, publicity agent, or public-relations counsel, on behalf of any foreign principal. By placing an advertisement, the advertiser acknowledges that Snap reserves the right to limit the services it provides, at its sole discretion, to avoid engaging in such activities.\n\nTransparency\n\nWe’re proud to maintain transparency with our political ad library.",

Now, sometimes I type something long out and then find that Snapchat decided to place my text below the \"send to X\" line, since I cannot click it to move it higher into frame, I am then required me to type out the whole thing again.

Because what’s the point in buying premium. Also why would they take away the GAMES. The games were personally my favorite part about Snapchat but then they got rid of them. I’m not happy Snapchat used to be my favorite app I’m 27 I got it when I was 14 and I think it was a lot better when I was younger. Another thing is when you send photos they don’t show up more than twice and I think both my kids are hiding something in the photos they send to their “friends”.

It started with Snapchat Premium and the Bitmoji cosmetics, which is somewhat tolerable, but now they allow companies to directly send you ads in your messages. This is shameful. Not to mention the most annoying updates from steam Snap which are UNBLOCKABLE! The new AI has the IQ of a rock and can’t help with anything you ask of it. Snapchat now does this new thing where they send you phantom notifications (like the red number on the top right of the app before you open it) just to make you open the app. And these new content pages NOBODY ASKED FOR that’s clearly only there to trap people into viewing things for the sole purpose of creator revenue. Plus the forced follows of these creators that NOBODY ASKED FOR. I can’t believe how far this app as fallen.",

I had to change my bday bc I put the wrong month and since then (it’s been over a year since I’ve done that) I cannot change my birth year to get a public profile. I contacted Snapchat support because the app claims that you can change your birthday a limited amount of times but doesn’t list the amount of times (you can only change it once). I never got the public profile. Another thing I found interesting was the ai. It’s lowkey creepy and it’s the only “friend” you can’t block it. Other than those concerns, I don’t think the app is horrible from my experience. I’d rate it a 3.5/5",

I’m just not gonna pay monthly for a dumb app. I hope you would not either. The reason is because what app is going to charge that much for “premium” I personally think it’s not worth it at all.  Because what’s the point in buying premium. Also why would they take away the GAMES. The games were personally my favorite part about Snapchat but then they got rid of them. I’m not happy Snapchat used to be my favorite app I’m 27 I got it when I was 14 and I think it was a lot better when I was younger. Another thing is when you send photos they don’t show up more than twice and I think both my kids are hiding something in the photos they send to their “friends”. I think Snapchat could use a lot of things to improve. If I made an app it would probably be better than Snapchat. This review is written by Ella.",

Now it’s a filthy advertising and profit hungry platform that wants nothing more then to take your money.

Not to mention the most annoying updates from steam Snap which are UNBLOCKABLE! The new AI has the IQ of a rock and can’t help with anything you ask of it. Snapchat now does this new thing where they send you phantom notifications (like the red number on the top right of the app before you open it) just to make you open the app. And these new content pages NOBODY ASKED FOR that’s clearly only there to trap people into viewing things for the sole purpose of creator revenue.

You need to ban these videos and accounts but sadly the filter people have done it one too many times and it has been ruined. They are literally promoting the real unfiltered things to buy. Yo have to ban Neon Lines the filter completely there are kids on the app and sadly they have to see that. As a app you need to do better. To wrap it up, Delete neon lines filter, ban every video and account. If you do many more people will have a much more fun experience on the app instead what I had and sadly to many people have had what I had so please ban these accounts and the filter.",

Come back to the office (let's say 3 days a week).  The young workers will be happy as it gets them access to an in-person community.  When i started out, being in a live team environment was incredibly useful for learning. Those going into the office will have an advantage in accelerating their career and over time others will opt in to returning to the office to compete or they fade away. \n\n2. Companies embrace remote working and realize that there are huge cost benefits in hiring from LCOL locations,  eventually moving most remote positions off shore.\n\nNext year is going to be a difficult economic year. When there are headcount reductions it will start with expensive remote workers.\n\n### Comment ID iybd2pw with +9 score by [(throwaway0891245, Reddit, 2022-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z816qv/snap_requiring_employees_to_work_from_office_80/iybd2pw/) (in reply to ID iy9fwni):\nAt this point return to office is a de facto layoff.\n\n### Comment ID iyaja81 with +2 score by [(tuzki, Reddit, 2022-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z816qv/snap_requiring_employees_to_work_from_office_80/iyaja81/) (in reply to ID iy9fwni):\ngotta be\n\n## Comment ID iy9jet1 with +401 score by [(sersherz, Reddit, 2022-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z816qv/snap_requiring_employees_to_work_from_office_80/iy9jet1/) (in reply to ID z816qv):\nIdk what other people's experiences with this are, but my company implemented this like 2 months ago and I am remote and still come into the office more frequently than some hybrid workers who are supposed to be in 3 days a week.\n\nI feel like companies say they will do this, people begrudgingly come in for a bit, then they stop and no one cares.\n\n### Comment ID iyaazww with +41 score by [(timelessblur, Reddit, 2022-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z816qv/snap_requiring_employees_to_work_from_office_80/iyaazww/) (in reply to ID iy9jet1):\nMy former place tired that.

Flexible hours and wfh days (though generally not full hybrid) were a thing long before COVID. No one’s checking badge logs or yelling at you if you get in at 9:02am. \n\nSo I think a lot of companies are that are going hybrid are really declaring a baseline policy and the reality will vary for individuals. One thing it does is set expectations that you do have to by physically present near an office, vs full remote where you could base in more places. \n\nI interviewed at a small quant hedge fund a while back and talked to someone pretty senior. They had a hybrid policy and he joked that he typically saw the engineers maybe once a week (in a way that he did not have any issue with that). I suspect we’ll see that kind of attitude a lot of places.\n\n#### Comment ID iyblz7v with +9 score by [(closethegatealittle, Reddit, 2022-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z816qv/snap_requiring_employees_to_work_from_office_80/iyblz7v/) (in reply to ID iyazu57):\n>No one’s checking badge logs or yelling at you if you get in at 9:02am.\n\nI know a couple of companies that are threatening action against employees if they don't go into the office by pulling badge reports and doing random walkthroughs.

It is likely an effort to increase productivity.  However it depends on how much severance they would need to do with laying off people.  These companies tend to be thinking 5+ years into the future at least.

First of all, besides just piercings, please add new jewelry such as necklaces (especially one with a cross on it, because so many people around the world, including me, are Christians, and we worship God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit) and bracelets, there can’t just be random face piercings! Second, please add braces and misaligned teeth (especially tooth gaps) because there are especially so many middle schoolers who have braces, and there are people who have misaligned teeth. Third, why don’t you add some new hairstyles, especially medium-length hairstyles because a lot of girls cannot even find their real hairstyles on your own app, I mean, there aren’t enough options, and there needs to be a wider variety of hairstyles because so many people have downloaded your own app. Fourth, please add some new clothing, especially clothing from Vineyard Vines, Lululemon, Lilly Pulitzer, Southern Marsh, Simply Southern, etc., also the 4th of July was a month ago, and y’all were supposed to add American-themed options for our Bitmojis, but y’all did not listen to us because I bet y’all just couldn’t get over with Pride Month because you think that there are way more genders than just male and female, whereas there are only two genders created by God, and y’all need to add some more flannel shirts, along with sports jerseys (Football, basketball, baseball, softball, cheerleader outfits, etc.) more suits for guys & more dresses for girls (especially whenever they have homecoming, winter formals, or even prom), and add some swimsuits/bathing suits, plus there’s more variety out in the world of fashion than just Black Lives Matter BS, especially clothing, plus BLM and Antifa are corrupt organizations that are about to become a thing of the past, y’all need to admit that there’s many preppy people all over the world! Fifth, there are only just 3 options for lips, why not add some more options, even just 6 options is more than just 3, also, why don’t y’all add some abs for our Bitmojis because so many people hit the gym all the time, add some more body types like pregnant women, Cellulite (which is very common in women), etc. because there are more than just 6 body types in the world, and why don’t y’all add some muscles to our Bitmojis, y’all can’t have just weak Bitmojis, also why not add some birth marks so that we can know what age the Bitmoji is! Sixth and final, on many stickers celebrating Holidays, y’all don’t even include Christian Stickers like for example, many people say “Merry Christmas” & admit that Jesus Christ was born on Christmas Day, but y’all just say “Happy Holidays” & only care about a sticker with presents under the tree just because y’all don’t even care about God like we do, y’all care so much about Muslim Holidays, Pride Month, Jewish Holidays, so many other religions and even irreligious/atheist/agnostic stickers, so why not add some Christian Bitmoji stickers, also for Easter, the only Easter-related thing y’all care about is the Easter Bunny who gives you candy, whereas Easter was the Resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and the lack of Christian-themed Bitmoji Stickers make a lot of Christians really mad and angry, including me!\n\nI hope y’all understand what I just said, now read this review, and then improve on your customization options, you have made so many people including me angry, Bitmoji!\n\n## Comment ID ilp8uh9 with +7 score by [(p4stelisqt, Reddit, 2022-08-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitmoji/comments/wf9nys/important_message_to_bitmojisnap_inc/ilp8uh9/) (in reply to ID wf9nys):\nbro what 💀\n\n## Comment ID iz8fyil with +9 score by [(deletus_my_fetus, Reddit, 2022-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitmoji/comments/wf9nys/important_message_to_bitmojisnap_inc/iz8fyil/) (in reply to ID wf9nys):\nI agree that there should be more options for customization…\n\nBut why are you coming at it from the angle of “I’m Christian, so you must do everything exactly how I want it 😡”.

This prevents me from using the snapchat buttons. This has not always been an issue for me as when I was on my OP3... The layout was correct. The snapchat buttons were above the on screen navigation buttons. Any suggestions? Maybe downloading an older version of snapchat?

I am not happy after joining Snap. Sitting in office today, I thought a lot of things.\n\nI graduated from pretty good universities. Almost all my friends and classmates chose FB and Google when graduating. We all have many other offers and compete our offers, many of my Google friends got 250-325 RSU as new grad, many of my FB friends got 160k to 220k RSU and 100k sign-on bonus. One of my friends chose MSFT, he like relaxing life, his package is 115K base and 150K RSU and espp (Buy company stock with discount). Now, their stocks value are all greater than 250K. Of course, they all have cash bonus from 10% to 20%. And some of them have already been promoted. \n\nWhen I graduated I got many offers, like SNAP, FB, Google, MSFT and have many upcoming on-site interviews like Uber and Amazon, finally I choose SNAP and reject all others since I think it is a s tart-up and I can take on many interesting projects and I can get promotion quickly and even is really COOL right. OK, that's where the nightmare began, the worst decision in my life so far.\n\nCompared with my friends in other company, how about me ? The poor guy who chose SNAP.\n\nWorking hard everyday. on-call every day. Finish many Jira tickets everyday. Bringing my laptop even on-vacation or in movie theater. No cash bonus. No promotion. They keep saying you will get promotion next time but they fail me everytime.\n\nHow about other new grads in this company ? Some experienced endless re-org, project is killed halfway over and over again; Some are working hard, 9 to 9, arriving company at 9 am and leaving at 9 pm; Some are doing really great job but all credits are taken by seniors, some seniors assign them many tasks and email the team 'Hey I introduce you a very powerful thing that I implemented'. Some want to change team but director D***d didn't allow and got piped. Unfortunately many of them are laid off, the 9-9 guy who is working hard everyday is laid off. New grad who joined 1 month ago is laid off. And many many many many............\n\nIt is SNAP which we choose as our first full-time company. We believe you, we trust you, we love you so we choose you. But you lay off so many good new grads, some are even in their 1st, 2nd month and some are waiting for H1B lottery.\n\nOur best java expert is also laid off, they are not the lowest performance guys, at least many of them are good, super good.\n\nNew grads, don't come. \n\n## Comment ID dw1ajt7 with +103 score by [(Toasted_FlapJacks, Reddit, 2018-03-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/85zgyl/new_grads_dont_come_to_snap/dw1ajt7/) (in reply to ID 85zgyl):\nDamn I heard things had taken a turn, but I didn't imagine it to be this bad.

Finish many Jira tickets everyday. Bringing my laptop even on-vacation or in movie theater. No cash bonus. No promotion. They keep saying you will get promotion next time but they fail me everytime.\n\nThis is extremely common across many employers.  I would encourage every person out there to treat their employer as if this is how their employer will behave until you see solid evidence first-hand that it's not.\n\nPromotions and raises are partially based on competence, but often only so far as a company most likely won't pay you more than the amount of value they think you provide.  However, even if you generated several million dollars of revenue, most employers would resist giving you a raise from $60k to $80k if they believed you would continue working there indefinitely at your current salary.\n\n>  We believe you, we trust you, we love you so we choose you.\n\nYou absolutely never should do the above!  Why did you trust, or worse love the company when they did absolutely nothing to demonstrate they were trustworth or (worse) deserving of love?\n\nI keep telling new-grads that their dream companies are not dream companies.

From the few connections I have, they say the work/life balance is not great. My recruiter didn’t know basic technical concepts that a recruiter should know like the stack they use for mobile development. He sold the program to me as a “fun experience” and told me that interns have created features used on the app (like the bitmoji that sits at the bottom of your chats) but for the most part you just work on an intern project for “experience”.\n\nWhen interviewing, they asked me if I had any other offers and I said yes, and then my interviewer tried to ask me specific monetary details about my offers (which I declined to share and they respected, but that was a bit odd). I also asked what the hours looked like for their developers (to know if overtime was a possibility) and my interviewer just emphasized that I basically couldn’t leave until my job was done. I’m assuming that doesn’t matter for interns since they just work on a side project, but if you are interning to possibly get a full-time offer, it sounds like they overwork their employees.\n\nIts up to you and your experience interviewing, but I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.\n\n## Comment ID f6mtx9o with +3 score by [(menpri, Reddit, 2019-11-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dra7ey/internship_at_snap_inc/f6mtx9o/) (in reply to ID dra7ey):\nI interned there and really liked it.

And, very rarely at the graduate level in computer science. But, my experience is somewhat different than the other answers here so I'll post it. Generally, an externship is for a law, medical, or Ph.D. student to obtain highly-specialized training they cannot at their universities.\n\nIn practice, the key difference between an internship and externship is that  an intern is paid by the organization they intern at. OTOH, an extern is paid by their home institution to work/study at the institution they extern at.\n\nFor example, a British professor may send one of his Ph.D. students to study at a Korean industrial laboratory to gain a deeper understanding of some cutting-edge research and bring it back home. Or an American surgical resident might be sent to extern at a hospital in France where new technique has been developed. The extern is still \"working/studying\" for their home institution. But, they are doing it somewhere else.\n\n## Comment ID kr1u87k with +3 score by [(Medium_Ad5485, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/17oopnv/are_externships_worth_it/kr1u87k/) (in reply to ID 17oopnv):\nDid you begin?

I'm sure they'll have you do SOMETHING. No manager wants someone shadowing them for 3 months. Put it as an internship on your resume and it'll be the same"

I’m just not gonna pay monthly for a dumb app. I hope you would not either. The reason is because what app is going to charge that much for “premium” I personally think it’s not worth it at all.  Because what’s the point in buying premium. Also why would they take away the GAMES. The games were personally my favorite part about Snapchat but then they got rid of them. I’m not happy Snapchat used to be my favorite app I’m 27 I got it when I was 14 and I think it was a lot better when I was younger. Another thing is when you send photos they don’t show up more than twice and I think both my kids are hiding something in the photos they send to their “friends”. I think Snapchat could use a lot of things to improve. If I made an app it would probably be better than Snapchat. This review is written by Ella.",

Not to mention the most annoying updates from steam Snap which are UNBLOCKABLE! The new AI has the IQ of a rock and can’t help with anything you ask of it. Snapchat now does this new thing where they send you phantom notifications (like the red number on the top right of the app before you open it) just to make you open the app. And these new content pages NOBODY ASKED FOR that’s clearly only there to trap people into viewing things for the sole purpose of creator revenue.

I contacted Snapchat support because the app claims that you can change your birthday a limited amount of times but doesn’t list the amount of times (you can only change it once). I never got the public profile. Another thing I found interesting was the ai. It’s lowkey creepy and it’s the only “friend” you can’t block it.

Yo have to ban Neon Lines the filter completely there are kids on the app and sadly they have to see that. As a app you need to do better. To wrap it up, Delete neon lines filter, ban every video and account.

Despite these challenges, the CEO and senior executives remain focused on Snap's potential to compete with TikTok and Meta. However, it must be acknowledged that the product and technology have significant flaws. Instead of investing in improving the advertising platform and rectifying these issues, which are pivotal in driving 95% of the company's revenue, the CEO prioritises funding a small yellow drone with a mere two-minute battery life. Additionally, Snap creators are compensated more generously than those on other platforms, possibly to create a false sense of community or activity.",

      "# [Snapchat Privacy](https://values.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy)\nThis section provides you with details on what information we collect. We’ve organized this in a few categories: information you provide to us, information we generate based on your use of our Services, and information we receive from others. Sometimes, we may also collect additional information, with your permission.\n\nWhen you use our Services, such as Snapchat, we collect information you provide to us, generate information when you use our Services, and in some cases receive data from others. Let’s break these down in more detail.\n\nInformation You Provide\n\nMany of our Services require you to set up an account. To do this, we ask you to provide us with account details (information about you, like your name, username, email address, birthday, and phone number). When you set up your profile, you’ll also provide us with profile details (like your Bitmoji and profile picture). If you use our commerce products to buy something, like those latest sneakers, we may ask you for payment and related information (like your physical address, so we can ship the product to you, payment information, so we can process the payment, and transaction history).\n\nOf course, you’ll also provide us with the information you send through or save within our Services. We consider some of this information to be private content and communications (like Snaps and Chats with friends, My Story set to Friends, Private Stories, voice and video calls, and content that is saved in My Eyes Only). On the other end of the spectrum, some of the information you send through or save within our Services may be public content that is accessible to everyone (such as Public Story content, including My Story set to Everyone, Shared Stories, and Community Stories, Spotlight or Snap Map submissions, and Public Profile information). Keep in mind that Snapchatters who view your Snaps, Chats, and any other content, can always screenshot that content, save it, or copy it outside the Snapchat app. So please don’t send messages or share content that you wouldn’t want someone to save or share.\n\nLastly, when you contact Support (content and communications shared with Support) or our Safety team, or communicate with us in any other way, including through our research efforts (like responses to surveys, consumer panels, or other research questions) we’ll collect whatever information you provide or that we need to resolve your question.\n\nInformation We Generate When You Use Our Services\n\nWhen you use our Services, we collect information about which of those Services you’ve used and how you’ve used them. This helps us better understand the way our community uses our Services so that we can make improvements.\n\nThis includes usage information (information about how you interact with our Services — for example, which Lenses you view and apply, Stories you watch, and how often you communicate with other Snapchatters) and content information (information about content you create or provide, your engagement with the camera and creative tools, your interactions with My AI, and metadata — for example, information about the content itself like the date and time it was posted and who viewed it). Content information includes information based on the content of the image, video, or audio — so if you post a Spotlight of a basketball game, we may use that information to show you more content on Spotlight about basketball.\n\nThis also includes device information (such as your hardware or software, operating system, device memory, advertising identifiers, apps installed, browser type, information from device sensors that measure the motion of your device or compasses and microphones, including whether you have headphones connected, and information about your wireless and mobile connections), location information (IP address), information collected by cookies and similar technologies, depending on your settings, (cookies, web beacons (small graphic data that recognize user activity, such as if and how often a user has visited a website), web storage, unique advertising identifiers), and log information (such as details about how you’ve used our Services, access times, pages viewed, IP address, and unique identifiers like cookies).\n\nIf you’ve explicitly granted device-level permissions, device information may also include information about your device phonebook (contacts and related information), images and other information from your device’s camera, photos, and microphone (like the ability to take photos, videos, view stored photos and videos, and access the microphone to record audio while recording video), and location information (precise location through methods like GPS signals).\n\nData We Receive From Others\n\nThe last category of data we collect is information about you that we may receive from others, such as other users, our affiliates, and third parties. This includes linked third-party service data (information we get when you link your Snapchat account to another service), data from advertisers (information from advertisers, app developers, publishers, and other third parties to help target or measure the performance of ads), contact info from other Snapchatters or third parties (if another Snapchatter uploads their contact list which includes your information, we may combine that with other information we have about you to better understand who you may want to communicate with. Or, if you provide us with your contact information, we may use that to determine if we can communicate with you in other ways, like SMS, email, or other messaging services), and data relating to potential violations of our Terms (we may receive information from third parties, including website publishers, social network providers, law enforcement, and others, about potential violators of our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines).\n\nOther Information, With Your Permission\n\nAdditionally, there may be instances when you interact with our Services that we will ask your permission to collect additional information. For example, before accessing your device’s camera roll or Contact Book.\n\nThis section explains how we use the information we collect. Among other things, we use the information we collect to provide you with personalized products and Services that we work hard to build and improve. Below, we walk through each purpose for which we use information in detail. If you’d like to see a mapping of the data we collect with the purposes for which we collect it, we have a table here.\n\nKeep Things Up & Running (i.e., operate, deliver, and maintain our Services)\n\nWe use the information we collect in order to operate, deliver, and maintain our Services. For example, by delivering a Snap you want to send to a friend or, if you share your location on Snap Map, to show you suggestions like places you might like in your neighborhood, content others have posted to the Map, or your friends if they’re sharing their location with you. We also use some of your information to help keep our products up to date, for example to make sure that our Services work with the latest operating systems and devices.\n\nPersonalize Your Experience & Give Context\n\nWe offer personalized Services to Snapchatters. One of the ways we do this is by showing you content that is relevant to you or we think you may enjoy based on the information you share with us. To do so, we use information about you across different areas of the Services in order to add context to your Snapchat experience. For example, we automatically tag content with labels based on the content, your location, or the time of day. So if there's a dog in the photo, it may be searchable in Memories by the term “dog,” show up on the Map at the location where you created the Memory, and inform us that you’re into dogs so we can surface you fun dog videos and dog food ads in other parts of our Services, such as Spotlight.\n\nPersonalization can also help with suggesting friends or recommending a new friend to send a Snap to based on who you Snap with the most. We may show recommended places on the Snap Map, generate stickers, or even generate Snaps and other content using AI to share with friends, infer your interests based on your content or activity, or customize the content we show you, including ads. For example, if you watch barista content on Spotlight, talk to My AI about your favorite espresso machine, or save a lot of coffee-related Snaps in your Memories, we may highlight coffee shops on the Snap Map when you visit a new city or show you content about coffee that you may find interesting or relevant. Or, if you interact with a lot of music venues we may use that to show you ads for upcoming shows in town. Personalization also includes tailoring your experience based on what your friends are doing, including showing you content your friends create, like, or enjoy on Spotlight or Place recommendations that are popular with your friends.\n\nOur goal is to continuously provide you with more relevant and interesting content.\n\nFor example, if you watch a lot of sports content, but skip content with hair and makeup tips, our recommendation algorithms will prioritize sports, but not those makeup tips. You can learn more about how we understand Snapchatter preferences and rank and moderate content here.\n\nWe believe it is critical to also balance the benefits of personalization with our Snapchatters’ expectations of privacy. For example, we may automatically tag the Snaps you save to Memories based on the content within it (e.g., the Snap contained a dog), and then use that tag to personalize your experience, make recommendations, or show you ads (such as showing you Spotlight Snaps containing dogs). We do not use the private content and communications you send to your friends to personalize your experience, make recommendations, or show you ads.\n\nProvide Relevant Ads\n\nAnother way we provide a personalized Service is through the ads we show. We use your interests and preferences from the information we’ve collected to personalize, target, and measure ads. We think ads are best when they’re relevant. That’s why we try to select the right ads and show them to you at the right time. For example, if you’ve interacted with ads for video games, we will infer that you like video games, and show you similar ads, but those won’t be the only ads you see. Similar to our content strategy, we try to ensure you receive a variety of ads. We also use your information to avoid showing you ads you probably won’t be interested in. For example, if a ticketing site tells us you’ve previously bought tickets for a movie — we can stop showing you ads for it. You can learn about the different types of advertising and your choices about which ads you receive here.\n\nYou can learn more about how we collect, use, and share your information for advertising purposes here.\n\nA note about information collected by cookies and other technologies: we may use these technologies to collect information when you interact with Services we offer through one of our partners. For example, we may use information collected on an advertiser’s website to show you more relevant ads. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our Services. To learn more about how we and our partners use cookies on our Services and your choices, please check out our Cookie Policy.\n\nDevelop & Improve Features, Algorithms & Machine Learning Models\n\nOur teams are constantly coming up with new ideas for features and ways to improve our Services. In order to do this, we also develop and improve the algorithms and machine learning models (an expression of an algorithm that combs through significant amounts of data to find patterns or make predictions) that make our features and Services work, including through generative AI features (artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images, or other media, using generative models. Generative AI models learn the patterns and structure of their input training data and then generate new data that has similar characteristics). We use algorithms and machine learning models for personalization, advertising, safety and security, fairness and inclusivity, augmented reality, and to prevent abuse or other Terms of Service violations. For example, our algorithms and machine learning models take into account the conversations Snapchatters are having with My AI to improve the responses from My AI.\n\nYour information can help us decide what kind of improvements we should make, but we are always focused on privacy — and we don’t want to use more of your personal information than necessary to develop our features and models.\n\nAnalytics\n\nIn order to understand what to build or how to improve our Services, we need to understand trends and demand for our features. For example, we monitor metadata and trends about Group Chat use to help decide whether we should change parts of the feature, like the maximum size of a Group. Studying data from Snapchatters can help us see trends in the ways that people use the Services. This helps inspire us to improve Snapchat on a larger scale. We perform analytics in order to identify, monitor, and analyze trends and usage. Based on this information, we will, among other things, create information about our users to help us understand demand.\n\nResearch\n\nWe conduct research to better understand general consumer interests, trends, and how our Services are used by you and others in our community. This information, along with analytics (as we described above), helps us understand more about our community and about how our Services fit into the lives of those in our community. We also engage in research and development to develop new techniques and technologies (e.g., new machine learning models or hardware, such as Spectacles). The results of our research are sometimes used in features on Snapchat, and we sometimes publish papers about things like overall behaviors and consumer trends (which will only have aggregated data across our user base, and not contain any private information about you specifically).\n\nEnhance the Safety & Security of Our Services\n\nWe use your information to enhance the safety and security of our Services, verify Snapchatter identity, and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity. For example, we provide two-factor authentication to help protect your account and can send you email or text messages if we notice any suspicious activity. We also scan URLs sent on Snapchat to see if that webpage is potentially harmful, and can give you a warning about it.\n\nContacting You\n\nSometimes we’ll get in touch with you to promote new or existing features. This includes sending Snapchatters communications through Snapchat, email, SMS, or other messaging platforms, where permitted. For example, we may use the Snapchat app, email, SMS, or other messaging platforms to share information about our Services and promotional offers that we think may interest you.\n\nOther times, we need to communicate with you to provide information, alerts, or to send messages our users ask us to deliver at their request. This may include sending communications through Snapchat, email, SMS, or other messaging platforms, where permitted, to deliver account status updates, security alerts, and Chat or friending reminders; it may also include fulfilling our user’s request to send invites or Snapchat content to non-Snapchatters.\n\nSupport\n\nWhen you ask for help, we want to get you support as quickly as possible. In order to provide you, the Snapchatter community, and our business partners with the help needed to resolve issues with our Services, we often need to use the information we have collected to respond.\n\nEnforce Our Terms & Policies\n\nWe use the data we collect to enforce our Terms and the law. This includes enforcing, investigating, and reporting conduct that violates our Terms, policies, or the law, responding to requests from law enforcement, and complying with legal requirements. For example, when unlawful content is posted on our Services, we may need to enforce our Terms and other policies. In some cases, we may also use or share your information to cooperate with law enforcement requests, escalate safety issues to law enforcement, industry partners, or others, or comply with our legal obligations.

      "# [Snap Inc. by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2016-09-24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.)\nAmerican technology company\n\n\"Snap (company)\" redirects here. For companies with similar names, see Snap (disambiguation) § Organizations. For other uses, see Snap (disambiguation).\n\nSnap Inc. is an American technology company, founded on September 16, 2011, by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown based in Santa Monica, California. The company developed and maintains technological products and services, namely Snapchat, Spectacles, and Bitmoji. The company was named Snapchat Inc. at its inception, but it was rebranded Snap Inc. on September 24, 2016, in order to include the Spectacles product under the company name.[12]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe company was founded on September 16, 2011, by Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy upon the relaunch of the photo sharing app Picaboo as Snapchat. On December 31, 2013, the application was hacked and 4.6 million usernames and phone numbers were leaked to the Internet.[13]\n\nBy January 2014, the company had refused offers of acquisition, including overtures from Mark Zuckerberg, with Spiegel commenting that \"trading that for some short-term gain isn’t very interesting.\"[14]\n\nIn May 2014, the company acquired the software company AddLive to provide needed technology to create a new video chat feature.[15] In that same month, it settled U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) charges over its having misled users regarding its collection of their address book data and transmission of their locations (without notice or consent), and regarding its claim that user messages disappeared after their expiration (rather than remaining accessible, as they had).[16] In December, the company acquired Vergence Labs for $15 million in cash and stock, who were the developers of Epiphany Eyewear, and the mobile app Scan for $50 million, which was revealed during the 2014 Sony Pictures hack.[17][18]\n\nIn May 2015, the company moved from its original headquarters to a 47,000 ft2 (4,366 m2) office complex near Venice Beach and signed a 10-year lease.[19] They were one of the first prominent online platforms to establish themselves there, alongside others such as Whisper and Tinder, giving Venice the new title of \"Silicon Beach.\"[20][21] In February 2017, two weeks before the company's IPO, The New York Times published a feature about Snap's role in turning the area into a technology hub, noting that Snap, with a total of 1,900 employees, had \"already changed the face of Venice.\"[22]\n\nIn September 2015, Snapchat acquired Looksery to develop Lenses for its mobile app, a feature based on Looksery's facial recognition software.[23]\n\nIn March, July, and August 2016, the company acquired Bitstrips for $100 million, Obvious Engineering, the developers of Seene, for an undisclosed amount and Vurb for $100 million.[24][25][26] Vurb formerly developed the eponymous mobile search engine. The Vurb card-based engine removed the need to switch through multiple other applications on the device to perform a task.[27]\n\nIn September 2016, the company officially named itself Snap Inc., and unveiled smartglasses known as Spectacles.[28][29][30] In November 2016, the company filed documents for an initial public offering (IPO) with an estimated market value of $25–35 billion.[31][32][33] In December 2016, the company opened research and development in Shenzhen and acquired advertising and technology company Flite and Israel-based augmented reality startup Cimagine Media for $30–40 million.[34][35][36][37] A partnership issued in December 2016 with Turner Broadcasting System will allow integration of Turner properties on Snapchat, while cooperating with Snap Inc. to develop original content.[38]\n\nIn January 2017, the company announced that it had established an international headquarters in Soho, London.[39] In early February 2017, the company confirmed their plans for an IPO in 2017 and its expectation to raise $3 billion.[40] In early March 2017, the company went public under the trading symbol SNAP, and raised almost $30 billion in market capitalization on the first day of trading.[41]\n\nIn late May 2017, the company acquired the location sharing app Zenly in a cash and stock deal. The Zenly app will remain functional, but its concepts were incorporated into a Snapchat feature added in June 2017.[42][43]\n\nIn August 2017, Business Insider reported that Google discussed an offer to buy the company for $30 billion in early 2016.[44]\n\nIn October 2017, the company announced that it had formed a joint venture with NBCUniversal to produce content for Snap's platforms, and that it had signed Duplass Brothers Productions as its first partner.[45]\n\nIn November 2017, Tencent acquired a 12% non-voting minority equity stake of the company in the open market.[46]\n\nOn October 26, 2018, at TwitchCon, Snap launched a new desktop application for macOS and Windows known as Snap Camera. It allows users to utilize Snapchat filters via PC webcams in video chat and live streaming services such as Skype, Twitch, YouTube, and Zoom. Snap also announced additional integration with Twitch.[47]\n\nIn August 2022, The Verge reported that Snap would be laying off 20% of its 6,400-person workforce.[48] The layoffs primarily impacted the company's hardware division and the developer products including the separately run Zenly.[48]\n\nOn 5 February 2024, Snap Inc. announced it would lay off 10% of its global workforce, approximately 500 employees, partly to enhance in-person collaboration, marking another significant reduction following a 20% staff cut in 2022.[49]\n\nOn September 12, 2024, Snap appointed Yahoo CEO Jim Lanzone to its board of directors.[50]\n\nProducts\n\n[edit]\n\nThe company develops and maintains the image messaging and multimedia mobile app Snapchat, as well as the Snapchat's Augmented Reality (AR) ad lens. The function was launched in September 2015. Specifically, the AR ad lens is one of the unique features of Snapchat, which allows advertisers to attract their target audience with various innovative lenses. Users can also use these lenses to change their faces, appearance, and even surroundings based on their preferences, and share those visual images or videos within their social networks.[51] In addition, the company also develops and manufactures the wearable camera called Spectacles, a pair of smartglasses that connect to the user's Snapchat account and records videos in a circular video format adjustable in any orientation.[52] On February 20, 2017, Snap Spectacles became available for purchase online.[53] The company sold only 220,000 pairs of Snap Spectacles V1. The company developed and launched Spectacles V2 in April 2018 in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and France; and 13 more European countries in May 2018.[54] On April 28, 2022, the company announced a mini drone called Pixy.[55] Later that year in August, it was reported that future development of Pixy would be discontinued, while continuing to sell the current iteration of the drone.[56]\n\nFunding and shares\n\n[edit]\n\nSnapchat app raised $485,000 in its seed round and an undisclosed amount of bridge funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners.[57] By February 2013, Snapchat confirmed a $13.5 million Series A funding round led by Benchmark, which valued the company at between $60 million and $70 million.[58] In June 2013, Snapchat raised $60 million in a Series B funding round led by venture capital firm Institutional Venture Partners.[59] The firm also appointed a new high-profile board member, Michael Lynton of Sony's American division.[60] By mid-July 2013, a media report valued the company at $860 million.[61] On November 14, 2013, The Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook offered to acquire Snapchat for $3 billion, but Spiegel declined the cash offer.[62] Tech writer Om Malik then claimed on November 15, 2013, that Google had offered $4 billion, but Spiegel again declined.[63] On December 11, 2013, Snapchat confirmed $50 million in Series C funding from Coatue Management.[64] Beyond 2014, the company had achieved a $10–$20 billion valuation, depending on the source, raising $100 million in Series D funding led by KPCB[65] and $485 million in a Series E round led by Alibaba Group.[66][67] Investors included General Catalyst, Kingdom Holding Company, SV Angel, Yahoo!, and Tencent. According to reports in May 2016, the company's estimated worth was said to be approaching $22.7 billion in the event of a new Series F round of investment of $1.8 billion from Spark Capital, General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital, T. Rowe Price, Meritech Capital Partners, Dragoneer Investment Group and others, led by Fidelity Investments.[68] Later, the company got an additional $200 million in the following Series FP round.[69] Further reports in 2016 suggested that funding was almost at $3 billion and that Snapchat was targeting yearly revenues of a billion dollars.[70]\n\nGoogle reportedly offered Snap $30 billion in 2016 for acquisition, which Snap turned down.[71]\n\n2017 initial public offering\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that \"people familiar with the matter\" stated that Snap Inc. would share 2.5% of the money raised in an upcoming initial public offering (IPO) with the banks managing the IPO. It also reported that after the predicted March 2017 IPO, the two Snap co-founders would hold over \"70% of the voting power\" in the company and own around 45% of the total stock.[72] On January 29, 2017, it was reported that the Snap Inc. IPO would likely take place on the New York Stock Exchange. As both the NYSE and Nasdaq had been \"aggressively courting the listing for more than a year,\" the Wall Street Journal called it \"a big competitive victory for the Big Board.\" Snap's IPO was estimated to value the company at between $20 billion and $25 billion, the largest IPO on a US exchange since Alibaba debuted in 2014 at a value of $168 billion.[73] Beyond the two founders, the two biggest shareholders for the planned early 2017 Snap IPO were Benchmark and Lightspeed Venture Partners, both prior investors and venture-capital firms from Silicon Valley. They held a combined stake of about 20%.[74] On March 1, 2017, it was reported that Snap Inc. \"values itself at nearly $24B with its IPO pricing.\"[75] Snap Inc.'s stock started trading on March 2, 2017, under the symbol SNAP, on the New York Stock Exchange.[76]\n\nWhen Snap reported earnings for the first time in May 2017, they reported a $2.2 billion quarterly loss, and the stock fell more than 20%, erasing most of the gains since the IPO.[77] Its market capitalization reached $100 billion for the first time on 22 February 2021.[78]\n\nIn February 2024 stock fell 30% after earnings with disappointing profit guidance.[79] Market capitalisation as of 3 March 2024 was $18B, below 2017 IPO level.[80]\n\nControversy\n\n[edit]\n\nReggie Brown lawsuit\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2013, Reggie Brown sued Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy. Early investors were also eventually named in the lawsuit. Brown said that he had once been the chief marketing officer for the initial selfie app used to launch Snapchat, offering evidence of contacts with publications such as Cosmopolitan. He also claimed that he had come up with the original concept, which he had ultimately called Picaboo, and that he had created the mascot logo for the product while working with Spiegel to promote and market the idea. Originally titled \"Toyopa Group, LLC,\" Brown said that he had named the newly formed company as well. Brown's lawyers offered documentation of a collaboration with Spiegel and Murphy, which included the filing of an original patent by the three Stanford classmates, but Snapchat described the lawsuit as meritless and called Brown's tactics a \"shakedown\". During April's depositions, Brown testified that he had believed he was an equal partner, and that he had agreed to share costs and profits. Spiegel instead described Brown as an unpaid intern who had been given an opportunity to earn valuable experience, and although Murphy claimed that he had not fully understood what Brown's role was supposed to have been, he too characterized Brown's involvement as having been that of an internship. Months later, Spiegel dismissed the lawsuit as an example of opportunists who seek out rapidly successful companies in an attempt \"to also profit from the hard work of others.\"[81][82][83][84][85][86][87][88]\n\nOn 9 September 2014, the company announced that they had settled the lawsuit for an initially undisclosed amount. The settlement amount was revealed on 2 February, 2017, in Snap's SEC public filing to be $157.5 million.[89][90] As part of the settlement, they credited Brown with the conceptual idea for Snapchat.[91]\n\nThe press release published by Snapchat's communication department quoted Spiegel:\n\n\"We are pleased that we have been able to resolve this matter in a manner that is satisfactory to Mr. Brown and the Company. We acknowledge Reggie's contribution to the creation of Snapchat and appreciate his work in getting the application off the ground.\"[91]\n\nFTC settlement\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission alleged that the company had exaggerated to the public the degree to which mobile app images and photos could actually be made to disappear. Following a settlement in 2014, Snapchat was not fined, but the app service agreed to have its claims and policies monitored by an independent party for a period of 20 years.[92]\n\n2018 redesign\n\n[edit]\n\nThe redesign of the Snapchat app in early 2018 made changes for which many users were not happy.[93][94] Around 1.2 million people petitioned Snap, Inc. to roll back the redesign. Snap, Inc's reply makes no concessions, other than noting, \"We completely understand the new Snapchat has felt uncomfortable for many.\"[95][96][97]\n\nDue to the redesign and other market factors in 2018, such as the growth of Instagram Stories and WhatsApp Status,[98] Daily Active Users (DAU) of the app only rose 2% from Q4 2017. Snap, Inc. stock fell more than 15% in after-hours trading following the earnings report release.[99][100][101][102] Growth of daily active users slowed in Q1 2018, and the growth rate for Q2 2018 was \"planned to decelerate rapidly from Q1 levels.\"[103] Snap, Inc. has commented on the redesign, saying, \"We have also started to realise some of the positive benefits [of the redesign], including increased new user retention for older users.\"[103] Some publishers feel the turn towards the older demographic spells the end for the app.[104]\n\nData storage\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a December 2020 announcement, Google Cloud confirmed the development of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) it signed with Saudi Aramco. The update stated the possibility of exploring options to establish cloud services in Saudi, where it confirmed storing Snapchat data. The decision was contested by Access Now, a non-profit organization, and CIPPIC, a Canadian public interest technology law clinic. The firms objected to Google's decision of choosing Saudi Arabia as its new Google Cloud region overlooking an alarming record of human rights abuse and longstanding surveillance accusations. The firms claimed that placing the personal information of millions of Snapchat users there would put it under the jurisdiction of the government of Saudi Arabia, jeopardizing the security of the data.[105][106][107]\n\nCalifornia civil rights lawsuit\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 2024, Snap paid $15 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the California Civil Rights Department alleging that the company discriminated against female employees with respect to pay and promotions, failed to prevent workplace sexual harassment, and retaliated against women who complained.[108][109]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",

      "# [13 Years at Snap Inc.](https://newsroom.snap.com/13-years-at-snap)\nDear Team,\n\nThank you so much for your extraordinary efforts and dedication to our business. Over the past year we successfully reversed two years of declining year-over-year revenue growth and are pacing towards record annual revenue. We built a sustainable cost structure, resulting in improved earnings and cash flow – again reversing two years of declines. We’ve made enormous progress growing our community to reach more than 850 million people, while growing content time spent +25% globally in Q2. Successful turnarounds are the exception and not the rule in business, and our progress to-date returning to growth is the result of your perseverance, focus, and teamwork. In the year ahead, we will prove that our progress is sustainable while further accelerating the growth of our advertising business and diversifying our revenue with Snapchat+.\n\nYou may be wondering why, with all of the progress we’ve made in our business over the last year, our share price performance has lagged the overall market. The answer is simple: our advertising business is growing slower than our competitors. The growth of our digital advertising business is one of the most important inputs to our long term revenue potential, and investors are concerned that we aren’t growing faster. Our lower growth rate reflects the ongoing evolution of our advertising business from one primarily driven by a small number of large customers spending against brand-oriented upper funnel goals to one that has a greater balance among different advertiser types and goals, with a much larger number of small- and medium-sized customers who are bidding against lower funnel goals. This evolution is well underway: In Q2, even as our upper funnel brand revenue declined by 1%, our lower funnel direct response revenue grew by 16%.\n\nOver the years, we have found that lower funnel revenue generated by small- and medium-sized customers is more predictable and stable than upper funnel revenue. It also represents a larger long term opportunity for revenue growth. Lower funnel revenue is ‘stickier’ because it is more closely tied to key business objectives and positive returns on ad spend, and as its scale increases it becomes more predictable because it is diversified across a larger number of advertisers and sectors. As we have learned from navigating the volatile macroeconomic environment, our business will be more resilient if more of our revenue is generated from a larger number of advertisers focused on lower funnel goals. With active advertisers more than doubling year over year in Q2, we’ve made a lot of progress, but there is more work to do.\n\nAs we look ahead to 2025, we need to grow our lower funnel business even faster while simultaneously reaccelerating the growth of our upper funnel business. We’re going to do that by changing the way that we go to market, introducing new ad placements powered by automation, and continuing to invest in our machine learning platform to deliver powerful results for our advertising partners.\n\nWhen we first introduced vertical video ads they were a novel and unique offering, but today this format has been embraced by most of our competitors. That means vertical video is less differentiated than it once was, and despite our unique and unduplicated reach in many of the world’s largest digital advertising markets, we need to further evolve our ad products and strategy to stand out. Unlike our competitors, we offer a lot more than a content platform. People use Snapchat to communicate with their friends and family, use our camera and Lenses, peruse their Memories, see what their friends and family are up to on the Snap Map, and more. Despite the many and differentiated ways that people use our service, we’ve historically focused our go-to-market efforts on the vertical video ad format within our content offerings. There is a significant opportunity to better surface insights based on the unique ways that people use Snapchat, generate actionable recommendations for advertisers, and deliver better outcomes by leveraging new ad placements across our service.\n\nIn the coming months, we’re going to start surfacing more unique and actionable insights to advertisers based on the diversity of engagement on Snapchat. Privacy-safe insights around store visitation powered by the Snap Map, interactions with Lenses through our camera, and public content posts in Stories and Spotlight can help advertisers drive better performance and engagement with our community. Today, many of these insights are only accessible through disparate tools that made it harder to serve our advertising partners. Bringing these insights together into a single, self-serve tool and helping convert them into actionable recommendations will allow us to demonstrate the power of our differentiated platform to advertisers while giving them the tools they need to resonate with the Snapchat community.\n\nIn addition to differentiated insights, we are also experimenting with two new ad placements: Sponsored Snaps and Promoted Places. These placements will help us meet the goals of our advertising partners by aligning our unique insights with differentiated solutions to drive return on investment across Snapchat. Importantly, both of these placements are designed to leverage the same full-screen vertical video Snap Ad format already used across Snapchat so that advertisers can automate placement across our service without having to develop bespoke creatives.\n\nSponsored Snaps empower advertisers to communicate visually with the Snapchat community, making the core functionality of Snapchat accessible to advertisers. Sponsored Snaps appear in the chat inbox as a new Snap without a push notification, and opening the message is optional. This allows advertisers to engage prospective customers all the way down the funnel all within a single ad unit; raise awareness with broad reach in the chat inbox, improve consideration with people who choose to view the Snap, and drive conversion with an in-message call-to-action. As we continue to evolve Sponsored Snaps, we are excited to enable more messaging features powered by generative AI and integrated into advertiser CRMs to help our partners communicate with their customers at scale. As always, your conversations with friends are private and are not used for advertising purposes.\n\nWith more than 350 million people using the Snap Map, we now offer one of the most used maps on mobile. Instead of using our map to get directions from A to B, people use the Snap Map to see what their friends are up to, explore new places, and keep track of their favorite spots. We’ve also found that places highlighted on the map can drive incremental visitation. For example, there is a typical visitation lift of 17.6% for frequent Snap users shown Top Pick-annotated places, relative to users shown a place without an annotation. With Promoted Places, businesses can use the Snap Map to reach incremental customers who are exploring places nearby and easily measure the visitation lift with our closed-loop and privacy-safe measurement.\n\nWe’ve made tremendous progress improving our advertising platform over the past year, growing our investment in ML infrastructure and building larger models using fresher data. We will continue to invest in our ML engineering team and infrastructure to better utilize privacy-safe signals, further consolidate our models to improve performance and reduce operational burden, improve cold start, and develop new model architectures with better feature representations. We will focus on key product offerings like dynamic product ads, app objectives, target cost bidding, and value optimization. We will help advertisers better optimize for in-session conversions and remove friction from the purchase flow by making it easier for Snapchatters to make purchases in-app. All of these investments will be enhanced by new, simplified, and automated tools to streamline buying across different placements, enable intelligent audience expansion, and optimize budgets across ad sets to maximize campaign performance.\n\nThe growth of our advertising business is only possible because our community loves to use Snapchat. Our product strategy has been inspired in part by In-N-Out Burger. In-N-Out has developed a loyal following by using high quality ingredients, focusing on doing a few things exceptionally well, and obsessing over customer satisfaction to deliver an excellent customer experience. Their hamburger, cheeseburger, and Double-Double are our Snapping, chatting, and watching Stories. You can decide which parts of our product are the milkshake, fries, and secret menu. We’ve learned the benefits of focusing on our core product experiences and making them truly great, and this year we intend to double-down on what is working.\n\nThe way we grow our community is by enabling Snapping. Visual communication is at the heart of what we do, it’s universally appealing - fast, fun, and deeply expressive. Snapping brings people together in ways that no other medium of communication yet invented has been able to do, and in doing so makes people feel happier and closer to their friends and family. This year we will continue to make it easier for people to start Snapping and chatting with their friends and family. We know that Snapping is a key driver of retention and frequency of using Snapchat, and most importantly - it makes a positive impact.\n\nGenerative AI has been transformative for our camera and Lens experiences, empowering people to express themselves in a Snap. Our AI Lenses are already some of the most used Lenses on Snapchat, and our on-devices model will allow us to further scale these experiences with faster generation and lower cost. This year brings many more opportunities to further improve identity preservation in generative Snaps, enable generative video experiences, and help people reinterpret and reimagine their Memories in new ways. Our innovation in generative AI isn’t limited to the camera. Teams across Snap have been embracing multimodal LLMs, powering everything from My AI to new trust and safety tools. Everyone at Snap should brainstorm ways that generative AI can make our business more efficient and better at serving our community. If you have an idea, we want to hear about it!\n\nThe growth we’ve observed in our content business this year has primarily resulted from improvements to personalization and increases in content supply, especially from creators of public Stories and Spotlight videos. We’ve been testing a combined content experience that brings together Stories and Spotlight into one full screen and easy-to-navigate interface. This helps improve the discoverability of new creators and content genres by moving beyond the tile-based discovery we offer today in Discover. We’re also testing a further simplified version of Snapchat that aims to improve accessibility and usability. While early tests have been directionally positive, we will be thoughtful and deliberate about making a change of this magnitude. Rolling out this simplified version of Snapchat should also provide new opportunities to improve application performance and load times.\n\nWe’ve also been working hard to help creators realize their full potential on Snapchat. Creators often share that they value Snapchat because of the relationship that they are able to develop with their audience through tools like Story replies. This year we are working on new ways for brands to collaborate with creators to develop unique ad creative and promote their products. We’re proud of the significant revenue share that we provide to creators and publishers and these new brand collaboration tools will offer further opportunities for creators to benefit from their creativity and reach on Snapchat. We’ll have more to share at our upcoming Snap Partner Summit on September 17th.\n\nThe reason that I’ve dedicated so much of my life to building Snap is because I believe deeply in the power of technology to make a positive impact in people’s lives. Over the past 250 years, the productivity gains resulting from continual technological advancements have driven the most extraordinary increase in overall human well-being in history. I worry that the techno-utopianism brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, when people were overly reliant on the Internet to live their lives, has given way to a regressive and alarmist moral panic about technology that threatens further societal progress. We need a balanced approach to, and a healthy relationship with, the technological advancements that improve our lives.\n\nWe believe that the responsibility to make a positive impact with technology begins with our own actions and I am so profoundly proud of our team for contributing in a positive way through the service we provide. New independent research validates what we have long known about Snapchat and how we are different from social media:\n\nRecent research 1 from the Netherlands into adolescent use of large social media platforms concludes that Snapchat is the only platform that positively impacts well-being. Snapchat also has a strong positive effect on friendships and no net negative effect on self-esteem. The researchers conclude that:\n\n\"We found a consistent negative impact of time spent on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube across all three mental health dimensions. Conversely, spending time on Snapchat positively affected friendship closeness and well-being but had no significant impact on self-esteem. Using WhatsApp had a notably strong effect on friendship closeness but no significant effect on well-being and self-esteem.\"\n\n\"The positive and null effects associated with Snapchat and WhatsApp indicate that we should avoid a blanket condemnation of all social media platforms.\"\n\n\"Given their widespread and frequent use among adolescents, the negative effects of TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram on well-being, self-esteem, and friendship closeness are highly concerning. These particular platforms employ advanced algorithms to curate personalized content, capturing users’ attention and keeping them continuously engaged. These algorithms can draw users into a near-hypnotic cycle of infinite scrolling. And indeed, nearly half of adolescents report that they use social media much longer than intended, leading to feelings of time wasted and time taken away from other valued activities. Consequently, the design of these platforms may play a critical role in adversely affecting adolescents’ mental health. Therefore, more research is urgently needed to explore how specific design features may contribute to – and can potentially counteract – these negative outcomes.\"\n\nAs part of the Australian Parliament’s investigation into social media and Australian society, three Australian mental health organizations recently jointly submitted research results 2 to Parliament with similar findings. These results were derived from The Future Proofing Study, Australia’s largest longitudinal study into youth mental health, and found that:\n\n\"[A] higher number of hours spent each day on TikTok was significantly associated with greater depression, anxiety, insomnia and disordered eating. A higher number of hours on Instagram was associated with greater depression and anxiety. However, a higher number of hours on Snapchat was not found to be significantly associated with any of the mental health symptoms examined….\n\nThe differences between these apps are attributed to differences in the way that adolescents use them. The study showed that more frequently using social media to passively consume content was associated with higher symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and disordered eating. The design of TikTok and Instagram encourages its users to passively consume content; using algorithms to deliver its users targeted content and various features such as ‘infinite scroll’ that keep its users engaged for long periods of time. By contrast, the study found no evidence to indicate that using social media to facilitate social connections was associated with poorer mental health. Rather, it found that more frequently using social media to communicate with people teens knew in real life was associated with lower symptoms of depression and anxiety. This may explain why higher number of hours using Snapchat was not associated with any of the mental health symptoms examined, because Snapchat is a messaging app that adolescents primarily use to communicate with their friends.\"\n\nThis doesn’t mean that bad things can’t happen when people use Snapchat. That’s why we’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars in our trust and safety teams over the past several years and designed our service to help keep people safe by moderating content and only allowing people to communicate with the friends they’ve selected. We’ll continue these investments, leveraging powerful large language models to help us scale moderation with higher accuracy. We’ve also developed new resources for educators and parents to help them learn more about using Snapchat responsibly. Our work to keep our community safe is never done, and we will continue to dedicate ourselves to these efforts.\n\nDespite our extraordinary efforts to make the smartphones we use every day better by introducing vertical video, ephemeral messaging, Stories, Lenses, and more, we continue to bump up against the limitations of screens. Smartphone screens distract us from the real world, require us to use small touchscreens to express ourselves, and aren’t designed to be shared with friends. That’s why we’ve been working to build augmented reality glasses for over a decade. Glasses are already worn by billions of people and allow us to interact with the real world using see-through lenses. As Alan Kay said, “People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware” and we’ve been focused on enabling extraordinary new software experiences brought to life through Spectacles.\n\nOur efforts to build Spectacles are part of what the business school crowd calls Blue Ocean Strategy, a concept introduced by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne that describes new, unknown market space where there is no competitor and demand is created rather than fought over. Blue Ocean Strategy plays to our strengths as an innovator and leader in augmented reality. Interestingly, Kim and Mauborgne find “large R&D budgets are not the key to creating new market space. The key is making the right strategic moves. What’s more, companies that understand what drives a good strategic move will be well-placed to create multiple blue oceans over time, thereby continuing to deliver high growth and profits over a sustained period. The creation of blue oceans, in other words, is a product of strategy and as such is very much a product of managerial action.” Or, in other words, a product of things that are under our control.\n\nToday, the market for augmented reality glasses is nascent. While we continue to differentiate and win share in the highly competitive market for digital advertising (a “red ocean”), we are investing in creating augmented reality glasses that allow people to interact with computing, the world, and one another in totally new ways. Unlike in digital advertising, where we were a late entrant in a market with established, scaled players, we are a leader in the market for this new type of glasses and in the development of our augmented reality platform that is already used by hundreds of thousands of developers and hundreds of millions of Snapchatters.\n\nReflecting on the past two years, I am in awe of our team’s ability to navigate an incredibly challenging environment with resilience and determination. Sometimes the most important thing is survival, and our team and business adapted to major upheavals in mobile advertising, increased competition, international conflict, and a challenging and volatile macroeconomic environment with interest rates at their highest levels in more than two decades. Former USA and Duke basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski, known as Coach K, talks about the importance of leaders turning bad things into something that will work for the team. He says, “Don’t worry about losing. Think about winning. In other words, even when you have a loss, you must ask yourself, ‘What is good about this? How can I turn a defeat into something that works for us?’” When I think about our teams and leaders that have made the biggest impact over the past two years, they have always focused on creating opportunities and finding a way to win.\n\nAs we plan for the coming year, we can’t predict the future but we can extrapolate from what we know today. Economic data shows that the United States economy is slowing, with recession indicators like the yield curve and the Sahm Indicator flashing warning signs. Countries around the world are grappling with high debt loads and large ongoing budget deficits. Both US presidential candidates are floating new revenue raisers including tariffs and taxes, which could further slow economic growth. The rapidly evolving regulatory environment continues to strain our team, and new legislation around the world may introduce further compliance burdens if we get lumped in with other tech companies despite the different design choices we made while building our service. Court proceedings on the TikTok divestment legislation loom in the coming months.\n\nIn short, we must continue to expect the unexpected. The uncertainty we’re anticipating around the world further emphasizes the importance of diversified revenue streams including an advertising business serving a large number of advertisers bidding against lower funnel, direct response objectives, and subscription revenue from Snapchat+. It also means that we are investing conservatively against a baseline plan that assumes modest ad revenue growth, while we work towards higher growth rates. This means that in a downside scenario, we are still well positioned to generate free cash flow with our current cost structure. We’ve also taken steps to further fortify our balance sheet with more than $3 billion in cash and marketable securities and no meaningful debt maturities until 2027. We believe that this conservative approach allows our team to focus on driving the long term growth of our business without having to worry as much about external volatility.\n\nOne of the consequences of constrained resourcing in our functionally-organized business is that leaner teams must work even more closely together to get work done, which makes them more prone to conflict. This is especially relevant as we have worked through the enormous challenges of the past few years, where adverse outcomes make it harder for us to take accountability for our own actions, and easier to point fingers and blame others. It’s never been more important to clearly and rigorously prioritize our highest impact initiatives, and take shared goals across teams to drive more alignment.",

Launch Innovative Virtual Resource to Educate Teens About Online Harms on 2024-10-01](https://www.dhs.gov/hsi/news/2024/10/01/dhs-know2protect-and-snap-inc-launch-innovative-virtual-resource-educate-teens)\nWASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Know2Protect campaign has collaborated with Snap Inc. to introduce today the Know2Protect Snapchat Lens, an innovative virtual prevention tool aimed at helping teens identify and navigate online risks.\n\nImage\n\nKnow2Protect is the first federal campaign dedicated to preventing and educating about online child safety risks and has partnered with Snap Inc. to help spread awareness to one of the campaign’s key audiences: teens. Snapchat — Snap Inc.’s multimedia messaging platform — resonates strongly with teens and will provide an additional avenue for the campaign to bring important online safety information to this community directly.\n\n“The dangerous reality is that as safety protocols are put in place to protect children online, predators are already working to find ways around them,” said DHS Cyber Crimes Center Deputy Assistant Director Mike Prado. “Collaborative tools, like the one we are announcing today, help empower teens and young people with the information they need to stay one step ahead.”\n\nThe Snapchat Lens is designed to engage teens through a fun and interactive quiz format that poses true-false questions about online safety and how to prevent potential online harms. Snapchatters will be able to apply real-time effects and animations to their videos, transforming the learning experience into an entertaining adventure.\n\nBy leveraging Snapchat’s interactive features, the Know2Protect campaign aims to create memorable experiences that promote awareness of online risks.\n\n“Snap is honored to be a founding member of Know2Protect — an important initiative to educate teens and adults about online child exploitation,” said Snap Inc.’s Global Head of Platform Security Jacqueline Beauchere. “We are excited to see the launch of this engaging Lens on our platform, which will continue to amplify the campaign's message across the country.”\n\nIn addition to the Know2Protect lens, Snap Inc. amplified the campaign’s reach through donated paid media, by promoting the lens on Snapchat. The lens will also be promoted on Know2Protect’s owned social media channels. Additionally, Snap is conducting ongoing research with teens aged 13 to 17 and young adults aged 18 to 24 in the United States about the various dimensions of child sexual exploitation and abuse online, which will help to further inform the campaign.\n\n“The Know2Protect Snapchat Lens equips teens with important information about online safety in an interactive way. We encourage parents and trusted adults to also check it out.

I use snapchat on the daily and one thing I noticed is that certain items in the clothing section to dress up your avatar you have to pay for. I know it’s been there for a while but I didn’t care about it a whole a lot until I was writing this review and it crossed my mind. Why should we have to pay $2 or any money at all just for a jacket for your avatar? Snapchat already makes a lot of money so I feel like paying for that stuff is unnecessary.\n\nNow for the main reason I’m writing this review. I am a snapchat plus user and I use almost every feature accompanied by snap+. But one thing I think would make having snapchat plus more enjoyable is being able to save your previous AI backgrounds. I use this feature a lot and love creating new fun prompts but sometimes when I choose a new one, sometime later I want my old one back. But I can’t get the exact picture back and instead have to recreate it somehow to get the closest thing to it because I can’t save them. This is just a suggestion (one I highly recommend), but for snapchat plus users like me, this feature would be pretty nice.\n\nrobot6527 ,\n\nStop Pointless Notifications and Ads\n\nI’ve been using Snapchat since 2013. I’ve seen just about every update that has came out, but lately, the updates are just pointless. Stop putting advertisement in my chat messages. I do not want to see advertisements in my chat messages every time I open the app. This type of advertisement is very annoying and I do not want to see it. Do better. Especially for things that I wouldn’t even buy. Also, I’m tired of getting a notification to add someone on my snap who isn’t even a friend. I’m tired of getting notifications to look at spotlight. I do not want to look at spotlight. I do not want to add people who are not my friends. The app will not stop giving me suggestions for things I do not care about. There is nothing in the settings to stop it from showing me suggestions of “friends” that aren’t even people I know. Every day I get on Snapchat there is a red notification trying to get me to add random person or check out random videos. Snapchat is supposed to be for showing your friends quick videos and funny things in a quick way. It is too flooded with public profiles and pointless videos to make you keep scrolling.",

What matters to us is understanding these complex consumption dynamics and reacting with smart decisions. Gaining visibility into Snap’s in-platform video consumption strongly supports our mission of holistic cross-channel video planning.”\n\nAbout Snap Inc.\n\nSnap Inc. is a technology company.

Center for Computer & Teacher Education Showcase.\n\nOur sustainable strategy for computer science for all involves integrating computing into various disciplines within formal education.\n\nIntegrating computing across disciplines ensures all students learn problem-solving with computing and provides teachers with innovative tools for teaching disciplinary content.\n\n“We’re excited to work with teachers from all grade levels, from Pre-K to high school, and in all academic disciplines, from the humanities and math to science and physical education, to prepare them to use computing tools to solve the problems that are important to them.” – Center Director Lauren Margulieux\n\n550+\n\nNumber of teachers who learned computer science fundamentals during the 2022-2023 school year.\n\n27\n\nNumber of courses where computer science concepts were taught across teacher preparation programs in the College of Education & Human Development.\n\nEmpowering Teachers\n\nThe Snap Inc. Center is dedicated to achieving computer science for all by training preservice teachers to integrate computing with a focus on equity, educational standards and evidence-based research.\n\nOvercoming Barriers\n\nThe computing integration activities we have developed for our teachers are all web-based, so they do not need specialized equipment to support computer science education.\n\nView the Snap Inc.

Because most of our teachers will teach in disciplines other than computer science, we use computing-integration activities in teachers’ disciplinary teaching methods courses. As a result, all teachers learn computing activities that are directly relevant to their teaching practice.\n\nGoals\n\nTo integrate computing into instruction in other disciplines to:\n\nExpand teachers’ toolkit of pedagogical and technological tools in the classroom to include computing tools\n\nGive students experience using computing to solve problems across a range of disciplines outside of standalone computer science instruction\n\nView our faculty fellows and projects\n\nIn April 2024, we hosted a workshop about ethical and appropriate use of generative AI tools in teacher preparation and education. Recordings of the workshop are available at AI Literacy and Applications.\n\nFor academic year 2024-2025, the Snap Inc.

It expects the majority of the costs to be incurred in the first quarter.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Snap has eliminated jobs. The Santa Monica, California-based company announced in August 2022 that it planned to cut about 20% of its global workforce. In the third quarter of 2023, it began winding down its AR Enterprise business, which included reducing its global employee headcount by approximately 3%, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nThere are 406 million users on Snapchat every day, on average, according to Snap’s website. It has more than 7 million Snapchat+ subscribers.\n\nSnap is among several in the tech industry announcing layoffs. Microsoft is laying off some 1,900 employees in its gaming division, according to an internal company memo. Online retailer eBay Inc. will cut about 1,000 jobs, or an estimated 9% of its full-time workforce. And Google has said that it was laying off hundreds of employees working on its hardware, voice assistance and engineering teams. Other companies that have announced layoffs include TikTok, Amazon divisions Twitch and Audible and Riot Games.\n\nSnap is expected to report its fourth-quarter and full-year financial results on Tuesday after the market close.\n\nIts stock declined 2.7% in Monday afternoon trading.",
      "# [Augmenting Video with AR: AR's Impact on Attention](https://forbusiness.snapchat.com/blog/ar-for-attention)\nThe Attention Journey of Omnicom Media Group, Amplified Intelligence, and Snap\n\nAs the media industry continues to come together around the value of attention in advertising and better understand how various inventory can capture it, Snap has journeyed with Omnicom Media Group and Amplified Intelligence over the past few years to learn about Snap’s inventory together.\n\nThe first phase of the research revealed the inner workings of Snap’s video inventory, which uncovered how consumers paid 2X* more active attention to video ads on Snap compared to similar inventory on other platforms.\n\nThe second phase of the research aimed to understand how new ad formats like Augmented Reality (AR) captures attention. To do so, Amplified Intelligence created a purpose-built camera environment using Snap’s Camera Kit SDK, which replicated a live, organic camera experience and provided a realistic environment for research and measurement. Over 2,100 respondents navigated this camera environment and were exposed to test brands amongst other organic Lenses, generating over 32,000 individual ad views. AR experiences represented 27 OMG brands across a variety of industries (Consumer Goods, Quick Serve Restaurants, Beauty, Retail, Apparel, Telco, Travel, Auto) and markets (US/UK/FR/KSA/CA/AU).\n\nThe study’s main focus was on understanding how AR captured 'active attention'—measured as the percentage of ad length during which viewers' eyes remained on the screen, as tracked by Amplified Intelligence’s eye-tracking technology – and lifted brand choice and loyalty, measured as Short-Term Advertising Strength² and Mental Availability³, which are both metrics correlated to purchase outcomes.\n\nMaximizing Attention with Augmented Reality\n\nThis latest research, combined with findings from the video research, uncovered how marketers can best leverage AR alongside video to enhance their campaigns for success.\n\nWith AR in the mix, Snapchat drives 5x more active attention compared to industry peers⁶\n\nAR is essential to maximize brand outcomes\n\nAll types of Lenses drove high active attention and lifts in both short-term brand choice and long-term brand loyalty⁶, with shareable AR experiences supercharging impact⁵\n\nAR in the Mix Drives Outsized Attention for Snapchat\n\nWith insights that span across Snapchat’s video and AR formats, Amplified Intelligence found that Snapchat drives 5x higher % active attention compared to social mobile in-feed platforms. This is because the unique, immersive, and engaging nature of AR was able to capture over 12 seconds of active attention⁶!\n\nThe Essential Nature of AR for Brand Outcomes\n\nAR's ability to engage users is not just about capturing eyes on screen; it translates into substantial lifts in both short-term brand choice and long-term brand loyalty metrics, demonstrating its essential role in enhancing brand outcomes.\n\nMoreover, AR complements existing video ad buys, contributing incremental gains in brand lift throughout the advertising funnel, highlighting its value in a comprehensive ad strategy, especially as Snapchat's design, which balances content consumption and creation, enhances the synergy across its tabs and supports the effectiveness of AR in driving these metrics.\n\nAR's Broad Impact Across Lens Types\n\nWhen breaking down performance by lens type, all drove high active attention and contributed positively to both short-term and long-term brand lift, confirming the versatile impact of AR across different marketing objectives⁶. For example, Face Lenses performed best for both short/long-term lift because it puts the consumer at the center of action and creates shareable moments, while shoppable Lenses performed well for short-term lift because it also puts consumers at the center of the shopping action.\n\nAdditional insights suggest that shareable AR content amplifies the impact of active attention. Not only is impact enhanced as users share the content, thereby extending its reach and magnifying its effectiveness, the actual desire for Snapchatters to connect with their friends and family may be translating to its added impact on brand performance ⁵˒⁷ .\n\nImplications for Marketers\n\nWith a scarcity of attention across consumers, marketers need to understand where they can take their investments and ensure that they can capture the attention needed from their target audience for their creatives to work. To that end, they must know that AR not only offers a more dynamic and attentive user experience but also significantly improves advertising effectiveness alongside traditional video buys. Brands should consider investing in creative AR ad formats that foster immersive and shareable experiences to maximize its impact.\n\nAs AR continues to evolve, its role in creating compelling, engaging, and interactive advertising narratives that resonate deeply with consumers will only grow. For brands and advertisers aiming to stay at the forefront, investing in AR is not just an option but a necessity for achieving sustained growth and robust brand loyalty."

    "# Comprehensive Analyst Report on Snap Inc. and Snapchat\n\n## Company Overview\n\nSnap Inc. is an American technology company founded on September 16, 2011, by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown, based in Santa Monica, California. Initially named Snapchat Inc., the company rebranded to Snap Inc. on September 24, 2016, to encompass its broader product offerings, including Spectacles and Bitmoji [(Wikimedia, 2016)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.). Snap Inc. is primarily known for its flagship product, Snapchat, a multimedia messaging app that allows users to send photos and videos that disappear after being viewed.\n\n### Company Scale and Workforce\n\nAs of early 2024, Snap Inc. has approximately 5,000 employees, following significant layoffs in recent years, including a 20% reduction in 2022 and a further 10% cut in February 2024 [(AP News, 2024)](https://apnews.com/article/snapchat-snap-layoffs-tech-b67df4deb437af7fc1612425a379cdd4). The company reported having around 406 million daily active users and over 850 million monthly active users as of September 2024 [(Google Cloud, 2024)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/snap-inc-partners-with-google-cloud-to-power-multi-modal-generative-ai-experiences-within-its-my-ai-chatbot-302256630.html).\n\n## Product Overview: Snapchat\n\nSnapchat is a multimedia messaging app that emphasizes visual communication through photos and videos. The app features various functionalities, including:\n\n- **Snaps**: Photos or videos that can be sent to friends and disappear after being viewed.\n- **Stories**: A collection of Snaps that can be viewed by friends for 24 hours.\n- **Spotlight**: A platform for user-generated content that showcases popular Snaps.\n- **Lenses and Filters**: Augmented reality features that allow users to modify their appearance or surroundings in real-time [(Snap Inc., 2022)](https://www.snapchat.com/add/itskcheyenne/fVxTgdI6QxCbXXwQcIaI3AAAgaGxodGx3aHNuAYxmnUXNAYxmnUCSAAAAAA).\n\n### Recent Developments and Features\n\n1. **Generative AI Integration**: In September 2024, Snap Inc. announced a partnership with Google Cloud to enhance its My AI chatbot using generative AI technology. This integration aims to improve user engagement and provide innovative features, such as translating images and providing health information about food options [(Google Cloud, 2024)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/snap-inc-partners-with-google-cloud-to-power-multi-modal-generative-ai-experiences-within-its-my-ai-chatbot-302256630.html).\n\n2. **Advertising Innovations**: Snap has been focusing on enhancing its advertising platform by introducing new ad placements like Sponsored Snaps and Promoted Places, which leverage the unique features of Snapchat to drive user engagement and improve advertising effectiveness [(Snap Inc., 2024)](https://newsroom.snap.com/13-years-at-snap).\n\n3. **Safety Initiatives**: In October 2024, Snap collaborated with the Department of Homeland Security to launch the Know2Protect Snapchat Lens, aimed at educating teens about online safety risks through interactive quizzes [(DHS, 2024)](https://www.dhs.gov/hsi/news/2024/10/01/dhs-know2protect-and-snap-inc-launch-innovative-virtual-resource-educate-teens).\n\n## Financial Performance and Market Position\n\nSnap Inc. went public in March 2017, raising nearly $30 billion in market capitalization on its first day of trading. However, the company has faced challenges in maintaining its stock price, which fell significantly after disappointing earnings reports in early 2024, leading to a market capitalization of approximately $18 billion, below its IPO level [(Wikimedia, 2016)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.) [(Snap Inc., 2024)](https://newsroom.snap.com/13-years-at-snap).\n\n### Revenue Growth and Advertising Strategy\n\nSnap has been working to diversify its revenue streams, focusing on lower-funnel advertising strategies that are more predictable and stable. The company reported a 16% growth in lower-funnel direct response revenue in Q2 2024, despite a decline in upper-funnel brand revenue [(Snap Inc., 2024)](https://newsroom.snap.com/13-years-at-snap). The company aims to enhance its advertising offerings by leveraging insights from user engagement and improving its machine learning capabilities to optimize ad placements.\n\n## Executive Leadership\n\nEvan Spiegel, co-founder and CEO, has been vocal about the company's commitment to innovation and user engagement. He stated, \"Snap is all about empowering people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together\" [(Google Cloud, 2024)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/snap-inc-partners-with-google-cloud-to-power-multi-modal-generative-ai-experiences-within-its-my-ai-chatbot-302256630.html). The leadership team has been focused on navigating the challenges of a competitive digital advertising landscape while maintaining a strong user base.\n\n## Partnerships and Acquisitions\n\nSnap Inc. has a history of strategic acquisitions to enhance its technology and product offerings. Notable acquisitions include:\n\n- **AddLive** (2014): To develop video chat features.\n- **Looksery** (2015): To create Lenses for the app.\n- **Zenly** (2017): A location-sharing app that has been integrated into Snapchat features [(Wikimedia, 2016)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.).\n\nIn addition, Snap has formed partnerships with various companies, including a recent collaboration with VideoAmp to integrate its advertising inventory into cross-platform planning solutions [(VideoAmp, 2024)](https://videoamp.com/press/videoamp-announces-industry-first-strategic-collaboration-with-snap-inc/).\n\n## User Feedback and Community Sentiment\n\nUser feedback on platforms like Reddit indicates a polarized sentiment towards Snapchat, with some users praising its innovative features while others express frustration over advertisements and app changes. For instance, one user noted, \"Snapchat is a cool app... but it could definitely use more changes,\" highlighting a desire for improvements in user experience [(Snap Inc., 2022)](https://www.snapchat.com/add/itskcheyenne/fVxTgdI6QxCbXXwQcIaI3AAAgaGxodGx3aHNuAYxmnUXNAYxmnUCSAAAAAA).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSnap Inc. continues to evolve its product offerings and advertising strategies in a competitive landscape. With a strong user base and ongoing innovations in generative AI and augmented reality, the company is well-positioned to enhance user engagement and drive revenue growth. However, challenges remain in maintaining stock performance and addressing user concerns regarding advertisements and app functionality. Prospective candidates and investors should consider these factors when evaluating opportunities with Snap Inc."
