Snapchat has over 850 million active users as of 2024 [(Snap Inc., 2025)](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/SNAP/snap-announces-pricing-of-upsized-offering-of-1-5-billion-of-senior-h4g05a52gnny.html). Snap Inc. generates revenue primarily through advertising, leveraging its large user base and innovative AR features to attract advertisers.\n\nSnap Inc. has faced challenges, including layoffs affecting 20% of its workforce in 2022 and an additional 10% in February 2024, as part of a strategy to promote in-person collaboration [(Wikimedia, 2016)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.). The company has also been navigating a volatile advertising market, with its stock falling 30% after disappointing earnings guidance in February 2024 [(Wikimedia, 2016)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\n- **Evan Spiegel**: Co-founder and CEO of Snap Inc. Spiegel has been a driving force behind the company's innovation and user engagement strategies. He has emphasized the company's commitment to reversing declining revenue trends and improving its advertising business [(Snap Inc., 2024)](https://newsroom.snap.com/13-years-at-snap).\n\n# News\n\n## Financial Performance and Fundraising\n\nSnap Inc. has been actively restructuring its debt.

The company has a market capitalization of approximately $18 billion as of March 3, 2024, which is below its 2017 IPO level [(Wikimedia, 2016)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.).\n\n## Product Updates and Safety Measures\n\nSnap Inc. has introduced new features to enhance user safety, particularly for teens. These include expanded in-app warnings, enhanced friending protections, and simplified location sharing. These updates are part of Snap's ongoing commitment to user safety, especially in light of recent controversies surrounding online exploitation and harassment on the platform [(Ortutay, AP News, 2024)](https://apnews.com/article/new-mexico-snapchat-attorney-general-sextortion-teens-1a1c4c856a24d15631f26bb69e0f4c74).\n\n## Partnerships and Collaborations\n\nSnap Inc. has formed strategic partnerships to enhance its advertising capabilities.

The company has responded by reiterating its commitment to user safety and the investments made in trust and safety teams [(Ortutay, AP News, 2024)](https://apnews.com/article/new-mexico-snapchat-attorney-general-sextortion-teens-1a1c4c856a24d15631f26bb69e0f4c74).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSnap Inc. continues to navigate a complex landscape of user engagement, safety, and financial performance.

      "# [Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms)\n2. Rights You Grant Us\n\nMany of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content. When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a license to use that content. How broad that license is depends on which Services you use and the settings you have selected.\n\nFor all content you create using the Services, or submit or make available to the Services (including Public Content), you grant Snap and our affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, cache, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, analyze, transmit, and distribute that content , including the name, image, likeness, or voice of anyone featured in it . This license is for the purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones. This license includes a right for us to make your content available to, and pass these rights along to, service providers with whom we have contractual relationships related to the provision of the Services, solely for the purpose of providing and improving such Services.\n\nWe call Public Story submissions and any other content you submit to public Services, like Public Profiles, Spotlight, Snap Map, or Lens Studio, “Public Content.” Because Public Content is inherently public, you grant Snap, our affiliates, other users of the Services, and our business partners an unrestricted, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, and perpetual right and license to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, reproduce, distribute, synchronize, overlay graphics and auditory effects on, publicly perform, and publicly display all or any portion of your Public Content in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods, now known or later developed, for commercial and non-commercial purposes. This license applies to the separate video, image, sound recording, or musical compositions contained in your Public Content, as well as the name, image, likeness, and voice of anyone featured in Public Content that you create, upload, post, send, or appear in (including as reflected in your Bitmoji). This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation if your content, including videos, photos, sound recordings, musical compositions, name, image, likeness, or voice included in your content are used by us, our affiliates, users of the Services, or our business partners. For information about how to tailor who can watch your content, please take a look at our Privacy Policy and Support Site. All Public Content must be appropriate for people ages 13+.\n\nWhile we’re not required to do so, we may access, review, screen, and delete your content at any time and for any reason, including to provide and develop the Services or if we think your content violates these Terms or any applicable laws. You alone, though, remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post, send, or store through the Services.\n\nWe, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place advertising on the Services, including personalized advertising based on the information you provide us, we collect, or we obtain about you. Advertising may sometimes appear near, between, over, or in your content.\n\nWe always love to hear from our users. But if you provide feedback or suggestions, just know that we can use them without compensating you, and without any restriction or obligation to you. You agree that we will own all rights in anything we develop based on such feedback or suggestions.\n\nIn summary: If you post content that you own to the Services, you remain the owner but you allow us and others to use it to provide and promote our Services. You also allow other users to view and, in some cases, use any content you make available to others on the Services. We have various rights to change and remove your content, but you always remain responsible for everything you create, post or share, or direct us to use on the Services.\n\n20 . Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver\n\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE THAT YOU AND SNAP AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND INCLUDE A CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER. This Arbitration Agreement supersedes all prior versions.\n\na. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. In this Section 20 (the “Arbitration Agreement”), you and Snap, including Snap’s officers, directors, employees, contractors and vendors, agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including all statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Services or any communications between you and Snap that are not brought in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and Snap are not required to arbitrate any: (i) disputes or claims within the jurisdiction of a small claims court consistent with the jurisdictional and dollar limits that may apply, as long as it is an individual dispute and not a class action, (ii) disputes or claims where the only relief sought is injunctive relief, and (iii) disputes in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. To be clear: the phrase “all claims and disputes” also includes claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of these Terms. In addition, all disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below. This provision shall be binding upon and enforceable against you, your estate, heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, including any party who is deceased at the time the dispute arises.\n\nb. Informal Dispute Resolution First. We want to address any disputes without needing arbitration. If you have a dispute with Snap that is subject to arbitration, then prior to initiating arbitration, you agree to mail an individualized request (“Pre-Arbitration Demand”) to Snap Inc., ATTN: Litigation Department, 3000 31st Street, Santa Monica, CA 90405 so that we can work together to resolve the dispute. A Pre-Arbitration Demand is valid only if it pertains to, and is on behalf of, a single individual. A Pre-Arbitration Demand brought on behalf of multiple individuals is invalid as to all. The Pre-Arbitration Demand must include: (i) your name, (ii) your Snapchat username, (iii) your name, telephone number, email address and mailing address or the name, telephone number, mailing address and email address of your counsel, if any, (iv) a description of your dispute, and (iv) your signature. Likewise, if Snap has a dispute with you, Snap will send an email or text message with its individualized Pre-Arbitration Demand, including the requirements listed above, to the email address or phone number associated with your Snapchat account. If the dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days of the date that you or Snap send your Pre-Arbitration Demand, arbitration may then be filed. You agree that compliance with this subsection is a condition precedent to commencing arbitration, and that the arbitrator shall dismiss any arbitration filed without fully and completely complying with these informal dispute resolution procedures. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or ADR Services’ Rules, the party against whom an arbitration has been filed has the right to seek a judicial declaration in court regarding whether the arbitration should be dismissed for failure to comply with the informal dispute resolution process set forth in this subsection.\n\nc. Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act, including its procedural provisions, governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision, and not state law. If, after completing the informal dispute resolution process described above, you or Snap wishes to initiate arbitration, the arbitration will be conducted by ADR Services, Inc. (“ADR Services”) (https://www.adrservices.com/). If ADR Services is not available to arbitrate, the arbitration will be conducted by National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM) (https://www.namadr.com/). The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. The arbitrator may issue orders (including subpoenas to third parties, to the extent permitted by law) allowing the parties to conduct discovery sufficient to allow each party to prepare that party's claims and/or defenses, taking into consideration that arbitration is designed to be a speedy and efficient method for resolving disputes. Any claims or disputes where the total amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum’s rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nd. Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.\n\ne. Fees. If Snap is the party initiating an arbitration against you, Snap will pay all costs associated with the arbitration, including the entire filing fee. If you are the party initiating an arbitration against Snap, you will be responsible for the nonrefundable Initial Filing Fee. If, however, the amount of the Initial Filing Fee is more than you would have to pay to file a Complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (or, for cases where that court would lack original jurisdiction, the California Superior Court, County of Los Angeles), Snap will pay the difference between the Initial Filing Fee and the amount you would have to pay to file a Complaint in Court. Snap will pay both parties’ Administrative Fee. Otherwise, ADR Services sets forth fees for its services, which are available at https://www.adrservices.com/rate-fee-schedule/.\n\nf. Authority of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Snap. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Snap.\n\ng. Settlement Offers and Offers of Judgement. At least ten (10) calendar days before the date set for the arbitration hearing, you or Snap may serve a written offer of judgment on the other party to allow judgment on specified terms. If the offer is accepted, the offer with proof of acceptance shall be submitted to the arbitration provider, who shall enter judgment accordingly. If the offer is not accepted prior to the arbitration hearing or within thirty (30) calendar days after it is made, whichever is first, it shall be deemed withdrawn and cannot be given as evidence in the arbitration. If an offer made by one party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain a more favorable award, the other party shall not recover their post-offer costs and shall pay the offering party’s costs (including all fees paid to the arbitral forum) from the time of the offer.\n\nh. Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND SNAP WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Snap are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Snap over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND SNAP WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.\n\ni. Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. This subsection does not prevent you or Snap from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or ADR Services’ Rules, disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this waiver may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator. IF THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS LIMITED, VOIDED, OR FOUND UNENFORCEABLE, THEN, UNLESS THE PARTIES MUTUALLY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE PARTIES’ AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE NULL AND VOID WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PROCEEDING SO LONG AS THE PROCEEDING IS PERMITTED TO PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION THAT IS PERMITTED TO PROCEED MUST BE BROUGHT IN A COURT OF PROPER JURISDICTION AND NOT IN ARBITRATION.\n\nj. Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.\n\nk. Opt-out. You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Snap can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify Snap in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement; otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes on a non-class basis in accordance with these Terms. If you opt out of only the arbitration provisions, and not also the class action waiver, the class action waiver still applies. You may not opt out of only the class action waiver and not also the arbitration provisions. Your notice must include your name and address, your Snapchat username and the email address you used to set up your Snapchat account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You must either mail your opt-out notice to this address: Snap Inc., Attn: Arbitration Opt-out, 3000 31st Street, Santa Monica, CA 90405, or email the opt-out notice to arbitration-opt-out @ snap.com.\n\nl. Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Snap may bring an individual action in small claims court.\n\nm. Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Snap, including any revocation of consent or other action by you to end your participation in the Service or any communication with Snap.\n\nIn summary: Unless you exercise your right to opt out, Snap and you will resolve all claims and disputes first through an informal dispute resolution process and, if that does not resolve the issue, on an individual basis using binding arbitration. This means that you cannot bring a class action suit against us in the event of a claim or dispute.\n\n2. Rights You Grant Us\n\nMany of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content. When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a licence to use that content. How broad that licence is depends on which Services you use and the settings you have selected.\n\nFor all content you create using the Services, or submit or make available to the Services (including Public Content), you grant Snap and our affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free (meaning that there is no ongoing payment to you required), sublicencable, and transferable licence to host, store, cache, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, analyse, transmit, and distribute that content, including the name, image, likeness, or voice of anyone featured in it. This licence is for the purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones. This licence includes a right for us to make your content available to, and pass these rights along to, service providers with whom we have contractual relationships related to the provision of the Services, solely for the purpose of providing and improving such Services.\n\nWe call Public Story submissions and any other content you submit to public Services, like Public Profiles, Spotlight, Snap Map, or Lens Studio, “Public Content.” Because Public Content is inherently public, you grant Snap, our affiliates, other users of the Services, and our business partners a worldwide, royalty-free, and irrevocable right and licence to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, reproduce, distribute, synchronise, overlay graphics and auditory effects on, publicly perform, and publicly display all or any portion of your Public Content in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods, now known or later developed. This licence applies to the separate video, image, sound recording, or musical compositions contained in your Public Content, as well as the name, image, likeness, and voice of anyone featured in Public Content that you create, upload, post, send, or appear in (including as reflected in your Bitmoji). This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation if your content, including videos, photos, sound recordings, musical compositions, name, image, likeness, or voice included in your content are used by us, our affiliates, users of the Services, or our business partners. The licences granted by you for Public Content continue for so long as the Public Content is on the Services and for a reasonable period of time after you remove or delete the Public Content from the Services (provided we may retain server copies of your Public Content indefinitely). For information about how to tailor who can watch your content, please take a look at our Privacy Policy and Support Site. All Public Content must be appropriate for people ages 13+.\n\nTo the extent permissible by law, you irrevocably waive — or agree not to assert against Snap or its affiliates — any moral rights or equivalent rights you may have in content you share on the Services throughout the world.\n\nWhile we’re not required to do so, we reserve the right to access, review, screen, and delete any content: (i) which we think violates these Terms or any applicable laws, including any additional terms referenced in Section 3, or our policies, such as our Community Guidelines, or (ii) if necessary to comply with our legal obligations. You alone, though, remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post, send, or store through the Services.\n\nWe, Snap Inc., our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place advertising on the Services, including personalised advertising — with your consent, where required — based on the information you provide us, we collect, or we obtain about you. Advertising may sometimes appear near, between, over, or in your content.\n\nWe always love to hear from our users. But if you provide feedback or suggestions, just know that we can use them without compensating you, and without any restriction or obligation to you. You agree that we will own all rights in anything we develop based on such feedback or suggestions.\n\nIn summary: If you post content that you own to the Services, you remain the owner but you allow us and others to use it to provide and promote our Services.

      "# [Introducing Bento, Snap's ML Platform](https://eng.snap.com/introducing-bento)\nThe source data for ML is stored using a variety of technologies and formats, such as BigQuery tables, Apache Iceberg tables, cloud storage buckets, and various other databases. The first step of ML is to turn these data into features for models to consume.\n\nAs illustrated in the following diagram, we subject this data to two primary operations. First, the majority of ML features are generated by aggregating event streams over sliding windows and grouping by various keys. For instance, a video-view feature might be defined as the \"number of views in the last 24 hours, grouped by video id\". We use Robusta, our custom-built feature platform powered by Apache Spark, to aggregate these types of features. The aggregated features are then (1) stored in an offline Apache Iceberg database for training purposes, and (2) disseminated to an online feature store.\n\nThe second operation generates training data. Training data is composed of training records, each assembled by pairing a raw event, which contains the label, with aggregated features. In a greatly simplified example of predicting user-video preferences, the raw event might be \"user id A likes video id B\". Then, this event is enriched with a selected set of user features and video features. Furthermore, training data must undergo transformations such as standardization, range-compression, and indexing before being supplied to a deep learning training job. Internally, this process forms a multi-step data pipeline, executed using a combination of Apache Spark and Google Dataflow. The output of this operation is a set of TFRecord files ready to be consumed by the training job.\n\nModel training forms the core of ML platforms, and given the diversity of use cases, we've designed our training platform to be highly adaptable.\n\nA standard model training job generally involves four tasks: (1) training data generation, (2) model training and tuning, (3) model evaluation, and (4) model export. These tasks create a workflow graph. Depending on the ML application, there are different variations of this workflow, such as composite models—where a model combines multiple separately-trained sub-models—and model distillation, where a sophisticated, resource-intensive “teacher” model is used to train a simpler, more cost-efficient “student” model. As flexibility is crucial, we've adopted Kubeflow which is an open-source workflow standard for ML applications. Through Kubeflow, we have a variety of workflow templates supporting a wide range of scenarios. Depending on the configuration, we orchestrate the workflows on Google Kubernetes Engine or Google Cloud's Vertex AI Pipelines. The following screenshot is a training workflow example displayed in the Bento UI.\n\nWe have already discussed the training data generation step in the previous section. The model training job is a Python application running on GPU or TPU hosts. While the training application could involve any user-provided code, to enhance ML development speed—particularly for ranking and recommendation applications—we've structured the application into three composable layers: (1) Core framework, (2) User model code, and (3) Training configuration.\n\nThe Core framework is an internal library that encapsulates Tensorflow and Keras, standardizing many aspects of modeling techniques and components for recommendation use cases, such as deep cross network and transformers. This structure enables ML engineers to experiment more efficiently with various feature ideas, and promotes code reuse and sharing. ML engineers then express their model by authoring user model code. Finally, the training configuration is a YAML file that outlines how the training job should be executed. For example, it specifies the type of hardware, the location of input and output data, and other runtime options that determine the behavior of the training code. This layered structure of our training code facilitates rapid experimentation by merely modifying the job configuration. Finally, we support model training on GPUs and TPUs. Our Core framework provides sufficient abstractions to handle flexibility of running training code on different hardware types.\n\nModel training has many hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and other model parameters such as layer dimensions. Part of the ML development process is to experiment with different parameter configurations. To facilitate this, we integrate Bayesian optimization to the workflow. Bayesian optimization suggests better parameter values based on observed metrics, reducing the amount of hand tuning ML engineers need to do.\n\nOnce a model is generated, we run an evaluation task to yield model metrics. We upload these metrics, along with those from the training phase, to Tensorboard for visualization. The evaluation results for each model are stored in a database and displayed in the Bento UI.\n\nFollowing the evaluation task, the Model Export task takes the trained model and prepares it for inference. At Snap, we use different hardware for inference, depending on factors like application, latency requirements, performance characteristics, and resource usage. The Model Export task creates optimized models for different types of hardware. For instance, for models destined for inference on GPUs, we examine the compute graph and determine which operations should be performed on GPUs—such as dense matrix multiplications—and which should be performed on CPUs, like feature parsing and embedding lookup. This optimization is crucial for reducing the serving costs of ranking and recommendation models, because these models exhibit a distinct pattern of dense computation that is compute-bound, along with large embedding lookup tables that are memory-size-bound.\n\nLast but not least, to maintain prediction accuracy, models must be incrementally updated as new events are recorded. Bento 100% automates incremental training. Our orchestration handles the incremental appending, joining, and transformation of new training data, preparing it for incremental training. The incremental training itself is scheduled on Kubeflow. After passing through export and various validations, models are automatically deployed to production. We have online ML monitoring to ensure the quality of model production, which will be introduced later in this article.\n\nIn the ML landscape, model production manifests in various forms. It can be embedded into an application backend, run offline to generate static predictions or embeddings, hosted as an RPC service, or even deployed to edge devices. Given Snap's Service-Oriented Architecture, Bento primarily supports RPC for model production, with secondary support for asynchronous and batch model invocations.\n\nOur inference service caters to both Tensorflow and PyTorch models, accommodating a range of use-cases such as computer vision, text understanding, and large-scale, real-time recommendation applications. The production of models for recommendation applications, however, presents distinct challenges. Some of these include:\n\nHigh fanout: A ranking request consists of user-related features and a large number of documents to score. This requires the inference engine to efficiently hydrate all user and document features.\n\nHigh predictions per second: Typical ranking-driven application backends, such as those for advertising and content, issue requests every few seconds per user session. When multiplied by the number of documents per request, we encounter a significant throughput. Generally, the more documents we can score per request, the better the precision and recall we can achieve.\n\nReal-time feature serving: For online recommendation applications, it's crucial to respond as quickly as possible to user engagement events to ensure that the recommendation output remains relevant and timely.\n\nBento has made specific design choices to overcome these challenges. Following is an overview of the internal architecture of the Inference service.\n\nTo address the high-fanout challenge, we employ two strategies based on the use case.\n\nIn the first strategy, we divide the online feature store into two parts: (1) a distributed key-value store as a centralized feature store for users, and (2) an instance-local feature store for documents co-located with our proprietary inference engine. Given that a typical ranking request involves scoring many documents relevant to a single user request context, we perform one user feature lookup before forwarding the request to inference. Document features are then hydrated within the inference engine. This local hydration process is highly efficient as it occurs without fanning out to different services, resulting in very substantial latency reduction and cost savings. This approach requires the inference engine instance to have the capacity to host the entire document feature corpus.\n\nThe second strategy involves pushing online document feature hydration upstream. This is where our Retrieval service comes into play. We have designed our retrieval service to function as a \"one-stop-shop for large corpus document retrieval.\" A simplified architecture diagram is as follows:\n\nThis strategy includes designing a distributed retrieval system capable of performing Approximate Nearest Neighbor, inverted index, and forward index lookups within each leaf node. This facilitates a flexible, single-pass retrieval and hydration query capable of returning relevant documents and their features. This approach is particularly suitable for use cases involving a very large document corpus.\n\nGiven the high volume of requests and documents to be scored every second, our inference engine is heavily optimized for the Total Cost of Operation. Here are some key optimization techniques we use in Bento:\n\nIn-house inference engine optimization: For instance, we use a shared-nothing architecture and carry out careful thread tuning for the Tensorflow runtime to ensure every CPU core is optimally utilized with minimal lock contention. Our build is further optimized for the hardware platform on which the engine is deployed.\n\nModel optimization for hardware: The Model Export step in our process produces various versions of the model targeting different hardware types.\n\nModel deployment optimization: Each inference engine loads one or more models. We fine-tune model co-location to take advantage of their differing performance characteristics. We build different inference fleets of engines on Kubernetes to scale differently for each use case.\n\nRequest batching optimization: For efficiency, a GRPC ranking request can contain multiple sub-requests for different models. Our Inference Front End service performs dynamic unbundling/batching and routing to optimize performance.\n\nData plane optimization: We minimize RPC serialization and deserialization cost by optimizing our inference APIs, so that ML features can be fetched and transferred in raw bytes, with deserialization only happening within the Inference engine. This and our custom optimized Protobuf deserialization resulted in 2x less latency and 10x cheaper dataplane costs.",

Come back to the office (let's say 3 days a week).  The young workers will be happy as it gets them access to an in-person community.  When i started out, being in a live team environment was incredibly useful for learning. Those going into the office will have an advantage in accelerating their career and over time others will opt in to returning to the office to compete or they fade away. \n\n2. Companies embrace remote working and realize that there are huge cost benefits in hiring from LCOL locations,  eventually moving most remote positions off shore.\n\nNext year is going to be a difficult economic year. When there are headcount reductions it will start with expensive remote workers.\n\n### Comment ID iybd2pw with +10 score by [(throwaway0891245, Reddit, 2022-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z816qv/snap_requiring_employees_to_work_from_office_80/iybd2pw/) (in reply to ID iy9fwni):\nAt this point return to office is a de facto layoff.\n\n### Comment ID iyaja81 with +2 score by [(tuzki, Reddit, 2022-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z816qv/snap_requiring_employees_to_work_from_office_80/iyaja81/) (in reply to ID iy9fwni):\ngotta be\n\n## Comment ID iy9jet1 with +399 score by [(sersherz, Reddit, 2022-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z816qv/snap_requiring_employees_to_work_from_office_80/iy9jet1/) (in reply to ID z816qv):\nIdk what other people's experiences with this are, but my company implemented this like 2 months ago and I am remote and still come into the office more frequently than some hybrid workers who are supposed to be in 3 days a week.\n\nI feel like companies say they will do this, people begrudgingly come in for a bit, then they stop and no one cares.\n\n### Comment ID iyaazww with +36 score by [(timelessblur, Reddit, 2022-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z816qv/snap_requiring_employees_to_work_from_office_80/iyaazww/) (in reply to ID iy9jet1):\nMy former place tired that.

Flexible hours and wfh days (though generally not full hybrid) were a thing long before COVID. No one’s checking badge logs or yelling at you if you get in at 9:02am. \n\nSo I think a lot of companies are that are going hybrid are really declaring a baseline policy and the reality will vary for individuals. One thing it does is set expectations that you do have to by physically present near an office, vs full remote where you could base in more places. \n\nI interviewed at a small quant hedge fund a while back and talked to someone pretty senior. They had a hybrid policy and he joked that he typically saw the engineers maybe once a week (in a way that he did not have any issue with that). I suspect we’ll see that kind of attitude a lot of places.\n\n#### Comment ID iyblz7v with +9 score by [(closethegatealittle, Reddit, 2022-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z816qv/snap_requiring_employees_to_work_from_office_80/iyblz7v/) (in reply to ID iyazu57):\n>No one’s checking badge logs or yelling at you if you get in at 9:02am.\n\nI know a couple of companies that are threatening action against employees if they don't go into the office by pulling badge reports and doing random walkthroughs.

Meanwhile there is plenty of room elsewhere.\n\n## Comment ID iyavlnx with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z816qv/snap_requiring_employees_to_work_from_office_80/iyavlnx/) (in reply to ID z816qv):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID iyax79m with +1 score by [(eric987235, Reddit, 2022-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z816qv/snap_requiring_employees_to_work_from_office_80/iyax79m/) (in reply to ID iyavlnx):\n80% would be four days, but yes that’s what it sounds like.\n\n#### Comment ID iyaxrig with +2 score by [(TravellingBeard, Reddit, 2022-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z816qv/snap_requiring_employees_to_work_from_office_80/iyaxrig/) (in reply to ID iyax79m):\nI don't math.

Would Snap already be a part of the SP500, and all other indexes like VTI or is there a certain waiting period?\n\n## Comment ID deg3ss5 with +23 score by [(Random5483, Reddit, 2017-03-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5x8fb3/is_snap_inc_instantly_in_the_sp500_and_in_the/deg3ss5/) (in reply to ID 5x8fb3):\nNo. \n\nThe S&P 500 is a set of large companies. Companies fall in and out of it every so often. A new IPO company is usually not in the S&P 500. And even once it is, it will take a few days for the index tracking funds to adjust their portfolios to track the index.\n\nIf you are invested in a total market fund that tracks the entire US market, then Snap, Inc., would be added to the fund within days (possibly longer). Again, the market tracking fund only makes adjustments periodically. The fund will not buy and sell everyday to track the market.\n\n### Comment ID degijdz with +5 score by [(erikpress, Reddit, 2017-03-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5x8fb3/is_snap_inc_instantly_in_the_sp500_and_in_the/degijdz/) (in reply to ID deg3ss5):\nThe market cap of Snap puts it in the top third of companies in the sp500.\n\n#### Comment ID dehfvtg with +1 score by [(Random5483, Reddit, 2017-03-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5x8fb3/is_snap_inc_instantly_in_the_sp500_and_in_the/dehfvtg/) (in reply to ID degijdz):\nThe S&P 500 is not the 500 largest companies.

I doubt they'll add Snap at their next review, but if they do, then yes index fund managers will have to buy some so that they're still faithfully tracking the index.\n\n> The components of the S&P 500 are selected by committee. This is similar to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but different from others such as the Russell 1000, which are strictly rule-based. When considering the eligibility of a new addition, the committee assesses the company's merit using eight primary criteria: market capitalization, liquidity, domicile, public float, sector classification, financial viability, length of time publicly traded and listing exchange.\n\n## Comment ID deg3nv2 with +2 score by [(Zeus1022, Reddit, 2017-03-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5x8fb3/is_snap_inc_instantly_in_the_sp500_and_in_the/deg3nv2/) (in reply to ID 5x8fb3):\nNo its not right now but the next time it is reviewed it might be.\n\n## Comment ID deg5tnq with +2 score by [(TheSingulatarian, Reddit, 2017-03-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5x8fb3/is_snap_inc_instantly_in_the_sp500_and_in_the/deg5tnq/) (in reply to ID 5x8fb3):\nIt might make the Wilshire 5000 (Total Stock Market) but, probably not the SP 500 just yet.\n\n## Comment ID degu0zi with +1 score by [(sockalicious, Reddit, 2017-03-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5x8fb3/is_snap_inc_instantly_in_the_sp500_and_in_the/degu0zi/) (in reply to ID 5x8fb3):\nThe S&P 500 Index has a curator.  Unsurprisingly, the name of the firm that curates the index is Standard and Poor's.   It is not just a list of the 500 highest market cap companies in the U.S.; rather, some wonks at S&P sit around a table once a year and decide who's in, who's out.  Then the index balancing is rejiggered so their decisions don't move the needle on the index on the day their changes take effect.\n\nMoving onto the index from the bottom is a life changing event for a small mid-cap company.  Because of all the index funds that now must enter a long position in that stock, the stock price can go up 10-15% in a day.\n\nIt's likely, but far from certain, that Snap will enter the index at the next opportunity.  But not all companies that are big enough are part of the index.  Warren Buffett famously jiggered his financial reporting at Berkshire for years so as to not meet the S+P's requirements.

TikTok owns that now.\n\n#### Comment ID kz4wgw5 with +2 score by [(Difficult_Teach_2930, Reddit, 2024-04-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1c1ilgl/whats_wrong_with_snap/kz4wgw5/) (in reply to ID kz4w4ja):\ntikout is out of the US game shortly..\n\n## Comment ID kz3pwiz with +28 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-04-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1c1ilgl/whats_wrong_with_snap/kz3pwiz/) (in reply to ID 1c1ilgl):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID kz6wxcu with +4 score by [(TheRealAndrewLeft, Reddit, 2024-04-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1c1ilgl/whats_wrong_with_snap/kz6wxcu/) (in reply to ID kz3pwiz):\nRoblox makes some money right?\n\n## Comment ID kz3f0ru with +50 score by [(IAMHideoKojimaAMA, Reddit, 2024-04-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1c1ilgl/whats_wrong_with_snap/kz3f0ru/) (in reply to ID 1c1ilgl):\nLeast deserving founder billionaire of all time\n\n### Comment ID kz3lyqi with +30 score by [(luciform44, Reddit, 2024-04-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1c1ilgl/whats_wrong_with_snap/kz3lyqi/) (in reply to ID kz3f0ru):\nElizabeth Holmes was a founder billionaire.\n\n#### Comment ID kz5u1xc with +5 score by [(Belugawhy, Reddit, 2024-04-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1c1ilgl/whats_wrong_with_snap/kz5u1xc/) (in reply to ID kz3lyqi):\nSo was Adam Neumann\n\n### Comment ID kz5s1r1 with +2 score by [(TechnicalInterest566, Reddit, 2024-04-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1c1ilgl/whats_wrong_with_snap/kz5s1r1/) (in reply to ID kz3f0ru):\nIf only we could all marry a Victoria's Secret Angel like him.\n\n## Comment ID kz53b2z with +8 score by [(Amyndris, Reddit, 2024-04-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1c1ilgl/whats_wrong_with_snap/kz53b2z/) (in reply to ID 1c1ilgl):\nSnapchat never recovered from Apple's ATT unlike FB who spent $9B buying AI chips to build AI models to work around Apple's ATT.  \n\nApple's ATT also hosed Unity who relied heavily on ads via their Ironsource merger\n\n## Comment ID kz726hr with +7 score by [(Numerous_Ear_8833, Reddit, 2024-04-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1c1ilgl/whats_wrong_with_snap/kz726hr/) (in reply to ID 1c1ilgl):\nI work with a leading fashion ecom retailer in middle east.

      "# Post ID 1eb969o: Snap L4 Offer Signed with +309 score by [(Travaches, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1eb969o/snap_l4_offer_signed/)\nCurrent: Backend engineer at a startup \\~30 engineers, 3.5 YOE. The base is 135k and equity is paper.\n\n**Process**\n\nI applied to a 3 YOE backend opening, then got approached by a recruiter. I asked about the process and asked for 1+ month to prepare.\n\n**Phone interview**\n\nThe interviewer was very friendly and professional (15+ YOE). Behavioral question on navigating through uncertainty (15 minutes). The technical question was based on BFS, but with one rabbit hole trap if you don't understand the graph well. After getting the working solution + test cases I explained the most optimal approach to building the adjacency list but didn't have time to code. (35 minutes) During the Q&A (10 minutes) the interviewer talked about how at Snap privacy is paramount and luckily I read a relevant blog article on Snap Engineering's blog on differential privacy and he seemed very pleased discussing it. Heard back about moving onto the onsite the next day morning.\n\n**Onsite Day 1**\n\nRound 1: An engineer from the short-form video ranking team came in. Behavioral was about telling a story when you had to finish a project given limited information. (15 minutes) Technical was a simple array-based question, but he wanted to go through all possible approaches on how to solve the question. I wrote the working solution + all test cases (30 minutes). That's when he gave a follow-up question with a tricky condition that you have to wrap your head around, and I had to reiterate the example case multiple times to understand the condition. After a few minutes, I figured out the logic and wrote the working solution + test cases. (10 minutes). He had one more follow-up question now to turn this into a stream-based question, but the approach was what we already discussed in the original question, and didn't have time to code. Did a brief Q&A (5 mins) about the technical details of how Snap ranks videos.\n\nRound 2: A team lead from the Maps came in. Behavioral was about empathy and kindness (15 minutes). The technical question was based on topological sort + DP. I got the working solution + test cases (20 minutes). Follow-ups were typical ones (finding cycles + best practices on function signatures) (5 mins). Asked quite in detail about what his team does (15 minutes).\n\n30-minute Q&A: This doesn't factor into hiring decisions. An experienced iOS engineer came in so I asked about tips on how to become a senior engineer. Good conversations.\n\n**Onsite Day 2**\n\nRound 1: I knew this interviewer had to be the bar-raiser based on the LinkedIn profile and prepared some system design ideas around what his team does. Behavioral was about learning new technology fast and he wanted exact details so had many follow-up questions (20 minutes). He gave a system design interview as I expected, and it was on ad insertion & delivery in stories. I prepared well for system design so it went well (35 minutes). Q&A was short since we didn't have much time left (5 minutes).  \n  \nRound 2: A different interviewer came in. Behavioral was again around working through uncertainty and I ran out of stories so I reframed one that I prepared for something else (15 minutes). The technical question was around the Dijkstra algorithm and we discussed a lot about using a priority queue vs a FIFO queue. The follow-up question was to do this in a distributed system so I gave a simple design similar to a Web Crawler design.\n\n**Result**\n\nI finished the last interview on Thursday afternoon and heard back about the hiring decision on Monday morning. The recruiter told me that I got strong feedback all around. I had team match calls with three different teams and I decided to go with the team that was most interesting to me (platform integrity + content moderation).\n\n**Offer**\n\nInitial offer: 185k base + 178k annual equity = 363k\n\nFinal offer: 190k base + 178k annual equity = 368k\n\nMy initial offer was already at the top of the band so I couldn't negotiate more. Maybe if I had experience working at FAANG or had offers from other FAANGs would have been easier. Other FAANGs didn't respond to my applications.\n\n**Tips**\n\n[https://interviewing.io/snap-interview-questions](https://interviewing.io/snap-interview-questions) was the best resource to learn about Snap's interview process. They have a very similar interview process as Amazon in that there's a behavioral question on every round instead of a dedicated behavioral round. Refer to Snap's values [https://eng.snap.com/values](https://eng.snap.com/values) and prepare at least 2 stories per value in SAIL (Situation, Action, Impact, Learning). The main difference is that the technical portion is around the same difficulty as Google or Meta. Snap looks at how fast you code, so perhaps that's why they give such limited time on the coding part by having a behavioral question on every round. If you can consistently solve mediums that you've seen around 5 minutes and haven't seen in 15 minutes, and hards around 30 minutes you're probably in good shape for trying Snap.\n\n**Edit:**\n\nOffer entry on levels.fyi: [https://www.levels.fyi/offer/28877853-ebf0-4833-b615-03a56329afd1](https://www.levels.fyi/offer/28877853-ebf0-4833-b615-03a56329afd1)\n\n## Comment ID ler85ul with +132 score by [(AyyLahmao, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1eb969o/snap_l4_offer_signed/ler85ul/) (in reply to ID 1eb969o):\nThat is a great L4 offer, I'm not too sure you could have increased by much more without having a senior offer\n\n## Comment ID les8au3 with +178 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1eb969o/snap_l4_offer_signed/les8au3/) (in reply to ID 1eb969o):\nman is this all the shit you have to go through for non new grad faang offer?\n\nSeems quite sweaty... fkn dijksrats and topological sort.\n\nCongrats on the offer! well deserved.\n\n### Comment ID lesq5mb with +58 score by [(YCheez, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1eb969o/snap_l4_offer_signed/lesq5mb/) (in reply to ID les8au3):\nI had a dijkstra graph problem for my L3 Google interview, the guy was a huge hardass\n\n#### Comment ID lesqwcm with +52 score by [(RaiinyDay, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1eb969o/snap_l4_offer_signed/lesqwcm/) (in reply to ID lesq5mb):\nBro for my Google L3 interview they gave me DP into 2D DP for follow up, I’m pretty sure they just didn’t want my ass\n\n#### Comment ID lesw6o8 with +18 score by [(ImSoRude, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1eb969o/snap_l4_offer_signed/lesw6o8/) (in reply to ID lesq5mb):\nI think Dijkstra's is actually okay given it's literally BFS with a priority queue requirement, I'd be annoyed if they asked for Tarjan's or something instead.

I currently work at snap and this is pretty standard interview process here. I also do work some with content moderation team (mostly ml side though) so maybe I’ll meet you in slack.\n\nThat is not the top of l4 payband but it’s solid offer. If your recruiter said that I guess that’s negotiation trick. Equity is pretty standard and not flexible outside rare cases. Salary band is pretty big though and can go up some more. Assuming california/similar col as locations do have some payband differences. Signing bonus are also negotiable and sometimes happen. Top of band offer for l4 is ~400ish.

That would mean in year 1 you get 25% of it. Year 2 would get a refresh and you'd get 25% if the initial grant + 25% of the refresh, etc.\n\nSometimes initial grants also have a vesting cliff - the first vesting date is 12 months in and then monthly after.\n\n(Just be clear what you're expecting - equity grants and salary don't quite add to initial total comp)\n\n### Comment ID lete4pw with +1 score by [(Travaches, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1eb969o/snap_l4_offer_signed/lete4pw/) (in reply to ID lete2rw):\nAnnual equity is 178k.\n\n#### Comment ID letetjw with +1 score by [(cballowe, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1eb969o/snap_l4_offer_signed/letetjw/) (in reply to ID lete4pw):\nWeird.

First of all, besides just piercings, please add new jewelry such as necklaces (especially one with a cross on it, because so many people around the world, including me, are Christians, and we worship God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit) and bracelets, there can’t just be random face piercings! Second, please add braces and misaligned teeth (especially tooth gaps) because there are especially so many middle schoolers who have braces, and there are people who have misaligned teeth. Third, why don’t you add some new hairstyles, especially medium-length hairstyles because a lot of girls cannot even find their real hairstyles on your own app, I mean, there aren’t enough options, and there needs to be a wider variety of hairstyles because so many people have downloaded your own app. Fourth, please add some new clothing, especially clothing from Vineyard Vines, Lululemon, Lilly Pulitzer, Southern Marsh, Simply Southern, etc., also the 4th of July was a month ago, and y’all were supposed to add American-themed options for our Bitmojis, but y’all did not listen to us because I bet y’all just couldn’t get over with Pride Month because you think that there are way more genders than just male and female, whereas there are only two genders created by God, and y’all need to add some more flannel shirts, along with sports jerseys (Football, basketball, baseball, softball, cheerleader outfits, etc.) more suits for guys & more dresses for girls (especially whenever they have homecoming, winter formals, or even prom), and add some swimsuits/bathing suits, plus there’s more variety out in the world of fashion than just Black Lives Matter BS, especially clothing, plus BLM and Antifa are corrupt organizations that are about to become a thing of the past, y’all need to admit that there’s many preppy people all over the world! Fifth, there are only just 3 options for lips, why not add some more options, even just 6 options is more than just 3, also, why don’t y’all add some abs for our Bitmojis because so many people hit the gym all the time, add some more body types like pregnant women, Cellulite (which is very common in women), etc. because there are more than just 6 body types in the world, and why don’t y’all add some muscles to our Bitmojis, y’all can’t have just weak Bitmojis, also why not add some birth marks so that we can know what age the Bitmoji is! Sixth and final, on many stickers celebrating Holidays, y’all don’t even include Christian Stickers like for example, many people say “Merry Christmas” & admit that Jesus Christ was born on Christmas Day, but y’all just say “Happy Holidays” & only care about a sticker with presents under the tree just because y’all don’t even care about God like we do, y’all care so much about Muslim Holidays, Pride Month, Jewish Holidays, so many other religions and even irreligious/atheist/agnostic stickers, so why not add some Christian Bitmoji stickers, also for Easter, the only Easter-related thing y’all care about is the Easter Bunny who gives you candy, whereas Easter was the Resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and the lack of Christian-themed Bitmoji Stickers make a lot of Christians really mad and angry, including me!\n\nI hope y’all understand what I just said, now read this review, and then improve on your customization options, you have made so many people including me angry, Bitmoji!\n\n## Comment ID ilp8uh9 with +7 score by [(p4stelisqt, Reddit, 2022-08-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitmoji/comments/wf9nys/important_message_to_bitmojisnap_inc/ilp8uh9/) (in reply to ID wf9nys):\nbro what 💀\n\n## Comment ID iz8fyil with +9 score by [(deletus_my_fetus, Reddit, 2022-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitmoji/comments/wf9nys/important_message_to_bitmojisnap_inc/iz8fyil/) (in reply to ID wf9nys):\nI agree that there should be more options for customization…\n\nBut why are you coming at it from the angle of “I’m Christian, so you must do everything exactly how I want it 😡”.

Here's the deltas that I find (keep in mind SNAP reports things in DAU and PINS reports things as MAU, therefore things like ARPU are not comparable between them):\n\n\\- As of today PINS has a higher market cap than SNAP ($16.77B vs. $15.51B)\n\n\\- SNAP has a lot more revenue than PINS ($4.6B vs. $2.8B for FY2022)\n\n\\- SNAP has a lot more debt than PINS does (about $4B more)\n\n\\- They both break out revenue into NorAM, Europe, and Rest of World (ROW). Revenue growth is pretty flat across all geographies for both companies, with the exception of SNAP's RoW which is +28% YoY.\n\n\\- SNAP has 750M MAU vs. 450M MAU for PINs\n\n\\- ARPMAU is very similar: $6.13 (Snap) vs. $6.22 (Pins) (Note: SNAP in its earnings release reports ARPDAU as opposed to ARPMAU, this is calculated based on taking revenue divided by their MAU).\n\nWhat explains PINS being worth more than SNAP despite significantly lower revenue / users? Is it simply that SNAP's balance sheet looks so much better? Anyone have any insights?\n\n## Comment ID j9hm507 with +12 score by [(SirGasleak, Reddit, 2023-02-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/118hd8h/snap_vs_pins/j9hm507/) (in reply to ID 118hd8h):\nSNAP's growth potential is limited. Their product is a single app that relies entirely on ad revenue. And they have no moat whatsoever; there is always the risk that a better app comes along that is cooler. Young people once used Facebook until they discovered Instagram, and then they discovered Snapchat.\n\nPINS has grown more slowly but they're only in the early stages of monetizing their user base.

So it’s theoretically pretty valuable since dependents do inform the spending habits and consumer awareness of families.\n\nPinterest core target is women and it networks into the family through mothers and daughters. It is not theoretically valuable - the app has always been designed around the idea of planning ahead and thus transformed into a shopping app. Pinterest is pretty close to something like Amazon than it is Facebook in its execution model. \n\nMany investors also approach this subject far too narrow minded.\nYou can ask 100 women how Pinterest and Instagram feel to use and you’ll see a significant difference.\n\nI am extremely bullish on Pinterest.

The kids that use SNAP for chatting will likey outgrow it, but I see PINS as a tool with longer term potential.\n\n## Comment ID j9k1cgq with +1 score by [(DeadHeadLibertarian, Reddit, 2023-02-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/118hd8h/snap_vs_pins/j9k1cgq/) (in reply to ID 118hd8h):\nLook into SNPO, Snap One.\n\nI do business with them regularly through our company, huge supplier of stuff form the AV and home automation industry. They are buying up competitors like crazy too.\n\n## Comment ID j9krqyr with +1 score by [(Atriev, Reddit, 2023-02-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/118hd8h/snap_vs_pins/j9krqyr/) (in reply to ID 118hd8h):\nYou threw a lot of metrics in the post but somehow failed to mention that one is profitable and one is not."

In general: expectations very high, hard to get promotions, nobody likes upper management, volatile stock, RTO requirements continue to constrict, seems like there's no communication between teams, constantly switching priorities, upper management will drop anything at the whim of the CEO. People frequently working after-hours or on weekends even when they're not on-call, especially for app-facing teams (internal teams less so). CEO likes to walk around office early morning or late afternoon wondering why nobody is in, once said \"this isn't a 9-5\", subsequently breakfast &amp; dinner hours were pushed outward to encourage employees to come in earlier and stay later. Frequent reorganization = shuffled between managers regularly. LA-specific: in-office commute zone is 50 miles, which for LA means many people were driving 2+ hours one-way or staying well after work hours/dinner to avoid rush hour. Diversity is ok when just walking around campus and seeing who is there but recently (2024) the company went through a settlement regarding discrimination and harassment against women. Not many managers/senior managers/above are women. Not many senior engineers are women. Diversity programs (engineering) getting funding cuts/decreasing in size since 2022",

Unreasonable hours and expectations from managers (even for Tech), who neither protect their reports' time nor their own. Unclear and under-prepared performance review process. Consistently receding benefits, including office conveniences, team perks, and travel budgets.

Despite these challenges, the CEO and senior executives remain focused on Snap's potential to compete with TikTok and Meta. However, it must be acknowledged that the product and technology have significant flaws. Instead of investing in improving the advertising platform and rectifying these issues, which are pivotal in driving 95% of the company's revenue, the CEO prioritises funding a small yellow drone with a mere two-minute battery life. Additionally, Snap creators are compensated more generously than those on other platforms, possibly to create a false sense of community or activity.",

However, it must be acknowledged that the product and technology have significant flaws. Instead of investing in improving the advertising platform and rectifying these issues, which are pivotal in driving 95% of the company's revenue, the CEO prioritises funding a small yellow drone with a mere two-minute battery life.

Unreasonable hours and expectations from managers (even for Tech), who neither protect their reports' time nor their own. Unclear and under-prepared performance review process. Consistently receding benefits, including office conveniences, team perks, and travel budgets.

People frequently working after-hours or on weekends even when they're not on-call, especially for app-facing teams (internal teams less so). CEO likes to walk around office early morning or late afternoon wondering why nobody is in, once said \"this isn't a 9-5\", subsequently breakfast &amp; dinner hours were pushed outward to encourage employees to come in earlier and stay later. Frequent reorganization = shuffled between managers regularly. LA-specific: in-office commute zone is 50 miles, which for LA means many people were driving 2+ hours one-way or staying well after work hours/dinner to avoid rush hour. Diversity is ok when just walking around campus and seeing who is there but recently (2024) the company went through a settlement regarding discrimination and harassment against women. Not many managers/senior managers/above are women. Not many senior engineers are women. Diversity programs (engineering) getting funding cuts/decreasing in size since 2022",

      "# [New Features to Help Protect Our Community](https://values.snap.com/news/new-features-to-help-protect-our-community)\nToday we’re announcing our plans for new features to further safeguard our community from online harms. Our new suite of tools will include expanded in-app warnings, enhanced friending protections, simplified location-sharing, and blocking improvements – all designed to reinforce the real friend relationships that make Snapchat so unique.\n\nThese expanded features build on our ongoing work to make it difficult for strangers to contact people on Snapchat. For example, we don’t allow anyone to be messaged by someone they haven’t already added as a friend, or have in their phone contacts. In other words, Snapchatters must proactively select who they communicate with.\n\nToday we are introducing the upcoming tools to help keep our community safe:\n\nExpanded In-App Warnings\n\nLast November, we introduced a pop-up warning when a teen receives a message from someone they don’t already share mutual friends with or have in their contacts. The message informs teens of potential risk so they can carefully consider if they want to be in contact and reminds them to only connect with people they trust. Since launch, this feature has empowered millions of Snapchatters to take action, leading to more than 12 million blocks. 1\n\nNow we’re planning to expand these in-app warnings to incorporate new and advanced signals. Once launched, these features will prompt teens to see a warning message if they receive a chat from someone who has been blocked or reported by others, or is from a region where the teen’s network isn't typically located – signs that the person may be a scammer.\n\nEnhanced Friending Protections\n\nPreviously we shared that teens will not be suggested in Quick Add or Search unless they have multiple mutual connections with the other person. We are now adding new friending safeguards that, coupled with our expanded in-app warnings, make it much harder for strangers to find and add teens:\n\nWe will prevent delivery of a friend request altogether when teens send or receive a friend request from someone they don't have mutual friends with, and that person also has a history of accessing Snapchat in locations often associated with scamming activity. This applies regardless of whether the friend request was sent out by a teen, or sent to a teen from a potential bad actor.\n\nTaken together, these two updates continue our work to address a growing trend of sophisticated sextortion scams, committed by financially motivated bad actors, typically located outside the U.S. and interacting with potential victims across a combination of online platforms.\n\nThese updates build on our work to combat online sextortion: We have never offered public friend lists (which can be used to facilitate sextortion schemes), we use signal-based detection to identify and remove bad actors before they have the opportunity to target others, we have invested in global cross-platform research, and we collaborate with other platforms to combat this crime and other potential harms. We encourage Snapchatters to learn more through our educational resources, like our in-app Safety Snapshot on financial sextortion, and on our Privacy & Safety Hub.\n\nSimplified Location-Sharing and Additional Reminders\n\nWe send all Snapchatters – including teens – regular reminders to check their account security and privacy settings, and only allow Snapchatters to share their location with friends. Now we’re introducingmore frequent reminders to make sure that Snapchatters are always up to date on which friends they’re sharing their location with on the Snap Map. We’re also introducing simplified location-sharing, making it easier for Snapchatters to customize which of their friends can see their location. With these updates, Snapchatters have a single destination to see exactly which friends they are sharing their location with, update their location settings, and remove their location from the map.\n\nAs always, location sharing on the Snap Map remains off by default, meaning that Snapchatters have to proactively opt in to share where they are. And Snapchatters can only ever share their whereabouts with their existing Snapchat friends – there is no option to broadcast their location to the wider Snapchat community.\n\nBlocking Improvements\n\nWe have long offered tools for Snapchatters to easily block someone if they no longer wish to be in touch with them. Sometimes, bad actors create new accounts and continue to try to contact people who have blocked them. In an effort to prevent bullying and potential repeat harassment, we’re introducing improvements to our blocking tools: Blocking a user will also now block new friend requests sent from other accounts created on the same device.\n\nThese new tools build on our ongoing commitment to help Snapchatters communicate with their close friends in an environment that prioritizes their safety, privacy, and well-being. We look forward to continuing to create even more protections, tools, and resources to help protect our community.",
      "# [Snap Inc. by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2016-09-24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.)\nAmerican technology company\n\n\"Snap (company)\" redirects here. For companies with similar names, see Snap (disambiguation) § Organizations. For other uses, see Snap (disambiguation).\n\nSnap Inc. is an American technology company, founded on September 16, 2011, by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown based in Santa Monica, California. The company developed and maintains technological products and services, namely Snapchat, Spectacles, and Bitmoji. The company was named Snapchat Inc. at its inception, but it was rebranded Snap Inc. on September 24, 2016, in order to include the Spectacles product under the company name.[12] Snap is co-owned by Tencent (which holds a 45.43% stake) and NBCUniversal, a division of Comcast (whose stake is undisclosed).\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe company was founded on September 16, 2011, by Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy upon the relaunch of the photo sharing app Picaboo as Snapchat. On December 31, 2013, the application was hacked and 4.6 million usernames and phone numbers were leaked to the Internet.[13]\n\nBy January 2014, the company had refused offers of acquisition, including overtures from Mark Zuckerberg, with Spiegel commenting that \"trading that for some short-term gain isn’t very interesting.\"[14]\n\nIn May 2014, the company acquired the software company AddLive to provide needed technology to create a new video chat feature.[15] In that same month, it settled U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) charges over its having misled users regarding its collection of their address book data and transmission of their locations (without notice or consent), and regarding its claim that user messages disappeared after their expiration (rather than remaining accessible, as they had).[16] In December, the company acquired Vergence Labs for $15 million in cash and stock, who were the developers of Epiphany Eyewear, and the mobile app Scan for $50 million, which was revealed during the 2014 Sony Pictures hack.[17][18]\n\nIn May 2015, the company moved from its original headquarters to a 47,000 ft2 (4,366 m2) office complex near Venice Beach and signed a 10-year lease.[19] They were one of the first prominent online platforms to establish themselves there, alongside others such as Whisper and Tinder, giving Venice the new title of \"Silicon Beach.\"[20][21] In February 2017, two weeks before the company's IPO, The New York Times published a feature about Snap's role in turning the area into a technology hub, noting that Snap, with a total of 1,900 employees, had \"already changed the face of Venice.\"[22]\n\nIn September 2015, Snapchat acquired Looksery to develop Lenses for its mobile app, a feature based on Looksery's facial recognition software.[23]\n\nIn March, July, and August 2016, the company acquired Bitstrips for $100 million, Obvious Engineering, the developers of Seene, for an undisclosed amount and Vurb for $100 million.[24][25][26] Vurb formerly developed the eponymous mobile search engine. The Vurb card-based engine removed the need to switch through multiple other applications on the device to perform a task.[27]\n\nIn September 2016, the company officially named itself Snap Inc., and unveiled smartglasses known as Spectacles.[28][29][30] In November 2016, the company filed documents for an initial public offering (IPO) with an estimated market value of $25–35 billion.[31][32][33] In December 2016, the company opened research and development in Shenzhen and acquired advertising and technology company Flite and Israel-based augmented reality startup Cimagine Media for $30–40 million.[34][35][36][37] A partnership issued in December 2016 with Time Warner’s Turner Broadcasting System will allow integration of Turner properties on Snapchat, while cooperating with Snap Inc. to develop original content.[38]\n\nIn January 2017, the company announced that it had established an international headquarters in Soho, London.[39] In early February 2017, the company confirmed their plans for an IPO in 2017 and its expectation to raise $3 billion.[40] In early March 2017, the company went public under the trading symbol SNAP, and raised almost $30 billion in market capitalization on the first day of trading.[41]\n\nIn late May 2017, the company acquired the location sharing app Zenly in a cash and stock deal. The Zenly app will remain functional, but its concepts were incorporated into a Snapchat feature added in June 2017.[42][43]\n\nIn August 2017, Business Insider reported that Google discussed an offer to buy the company for $30 billion in early 2016.[44]\n\nIn October 2017, the company announced that it had formed a joint venture with NBCUniversal to produce content for Snap's platforms, and that it had signed Duplass Brothers Productions as its first partner.[45]\n\nIn November 2017, Tencent acquired a 12% non-voting minority equity stake of the company in the open market.[46]\n\nOn October 26, 2018, at TwitchCon, Snap launched a new desktop application for macOS and Windows known as Snap Camera. It allows users to utilize Snapchat filters via PC webcams in video chat and live streaming services such as Skype, Twitch, YouTube, and Zoom. Snap also announced additional integration with Twitch.[47]\n\nIn August 2022, The Verge reported that Snap would be laying off 20% of its 6,400-person workforce.[48] The layoffs primarily impacted the company's hardware division and the developer products including the separately run Zenly.[48]\n\nOn 5 February 2024, Snap Inc. announced it would lay off 10% of its global workforce, approximately 500 employees, partly to \"promote in-person collaboration\", marking another significant reduction following a 20% staff cut in 2022.[49]\n\nOn September 12, 2024, Snap appointed Yahoo CEO Jim Lanzone to its board of directors.[50]\n\nProducts\n\n[edit]\n\nThe company develops and maintains the image messaging and multimedia mobile app Snapchat, as well as the Snapchat's Augmented Reality (AR) ad lens. The function was launched in September 2015. Specifically, the AR ad lens is one of the unique features of Snapchat, which allows advertisers to attract their target audience with various innovative lenses. Users can also use these lenses to change their faces, appearance, and even surroundings based on their preferences, and share those visual images or videos within their social networks.[51] In addition, the company also develops and manufactures the wearable camera called Spectacles, a pair of smartglasses that connect to the user's Snapchat account and records videos in a circular video format adjustable in any orientation.[52] On February 20, 2017, Snap Spectacles became available for purchase online.[53] The company sold only 220,000 pairs of Snap Spectacles V1. The company developed and launched Spectacles V2 in April 2018 in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and France; and 13 more European countries in May 2018.[54] On April 28, 2022, the company announced a mini drone called Pixy.[55] Later that year in August, it was reported that future development of Pixy would be discontinued, while continuing to sell the current iteration of the drone.[56]\n\nFunding and shares\n\n[edit]\n\nSnapchat app raised $485,000 in its seed round and an undisclosed amount of bridge funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners.[57] By February 2013, Snapchat confirmed a $13.5 million Series A funding round led by Benchmark, which valued the company at between $60 million and $70 million.[58] In June 2013, Snapchat raised $60 million in a Series B funding round led by venture capital firm Institutional Venture Partners.[59] The firm also appointed a new high-profile board member, Michael Lynton of Sony's American division.[60] By mid-July 2013, a media report valued the company at $860 million.[61] On November 14, 2013, The Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook offered to acquire Snapchat for $3 billion, but Spiegel declined the cash offer.[62] Tech writer Om Malik then claimed on November 15, 2013, that Google had offered $4 billion, but Spiegel again declined.[63] On December 11, 2013, Snapchat confirmed $50 million in Series C funding from Coatue Management.[64] Beyond 2014, the company had achieved a $10–$20 billion valuation, depending on the source, raising $100 million in Series D funding led by KPCB[65] and $485 million in a Series E round led by Alibaba Group.[66][67] Investors included General Catalyst, Kingdom Holding Company, SV Angel, Yahoo!, NBCUniversal, and Tencent. According to reports in May 2016, the company's estimated worth was said to be approaching $22.7 billion in the event of a new Series F round of investment of $1.8 billion from Spark Capital, General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital, T. Rowe Price, Meritech Capital Partners, Dragoneer Investment Group and others, led by Fidelity Investments.[68] Later, the company got an additional $200 million in the following Series FP round.[69] Further reports in 2016 suggested that funding was almost at $3 billion and that Snapchat was targeting yearly revenues of a billion dollars.[70] Google reportedly offered Snap $30 billion in 2016 for acquisition, which Snap turned down.[71]\n\n2017 initial public offering\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that \"people familiar with the matter\" stated that Snap Inc. would share 2.5% of the money raised in an upcoming initial public offering (IPO) with the banks managing the IPO. It also reported that after the predicted March 2017 IPO, the two Snap co-founders would hold over \"70% of the voting power\" in the company and own around 45% of the total stock.[72] On January 29, 2017, it was reported that the Snap Inc. IPO would likely take place on the New York Stock Exchange. As both the NYSE and Nasdaq had been \"aggressively courting the listing for more than a year,\" the Wall Street Journal called it \"a big competitive victory for the Big Board.\" Snap's IPO was estimated to value the company at between $20 billion and $25 billion, the largest IPO on a US exchange since Alibaba debuted in 2014 at a value of $168 billion.[73] Beyond the two founders, the two biggest shareholders for the planned early 2017 Snap IPO were Benchmark and Lightspeed Venture Partners, both prior investors and venture-capital firms from Silicon Valley. They held a combined stake of about 20%.[74] On March 1, 2017, it was reported that Snap Inc. \"values itself at nearly $24B with its IPO pricing.\"[75] Snap Inc.'s stock started trading on March 2, 2017, under the symbol SNAP, on the New York Stock Exchange.[76]\n\nWhen Snap reported earnings for the first time in May 2017, they reported a $2.2 billion quarterly loss, and the stock fell more than 20%, erasing most of the gains since the IPO.[77] Its market capitalization reached $100 billion for the first time on 22 February 2021.[78]\n\nIn February 2024 stock fell 30% after earnings with disappointing profit guidance.[79] Market capitalisation as of 3 March 2024 was $18B, below 2017 IPO level.[80]\n\nControversy\n\n[edit]\n\nReggie Brown lawsuit\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2013, Reggie Brown sued Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy. Early investors were also eventually named in the lawsuit. Brown said that he had once been the chief marketing officer for the initial selfie app used to launch Snapchat, offering evidence of contacts with publications such as Cosmopolitan. He also claimed that he had come up with the original concept, which he had ultimately called Picaboo, and that he had created the mascot logo for the product while working with Spiegel to promote and market the idea. Originally titled \"Toyopa Group, LLC,\" Brown said that he had named the newly formed company as well. Brown's lawyers offered documentation of a collaboration with Spiegel and Murphy, which included the filing of an original patent by the three Stanford classmates, but Snapchat described the lawsuit as meritless and called Brown's tactics a \"shakedown\". During April's depositions, Brown testified that he had believed he was an equal partner, and that he had agreed to share costs and profits. Spiegel instead described Brown as an unpaid intern who had been given an opportunity to earn valuable experience, and although Murphy claimed that he had not fully understood what Brown's role was supposed to have been, he too characterized Brown's involvement as having been that of an internship. Months later, Spiegel dismissed the lawsuit as an example of opportunists who seek out rapidly successful companies in an attempt \"to also profit from the hard work of others.\"[81][82][83][84][85][86][87][88]\n\nOn 9 September 2014, the company announced that they had settled the lawsuit for an initially undisclosed amount. The settlement amount was revealed on 2 February, 2017, in Snap's SEC public filing to be $157.5 million.[89][90] As part of the settlement, they credited Brown with the conceptual idea for Snapchat.[91]\n\nThe press release published by Snapchat's communication department quoted Spiegel:\n\n\"We are pleased that we have been able to resolve this matter in a manner that is satisfactory to Mr. Brown and the Company. We acknowledge Reggie's contribution to the creation of Snapchat and appreciate his work in getting the application off the ground.\"[91]\n\nFTC settlement\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission alleged that the company had exaggerated to the public the degree to which mobile app images and photos could actually be made to disappear. Following a settlement in 2014, Snapchat was not fined, but the app service agreed to have its claims and policies monitored by an independent party for a period of 20 years.[92]\n\n2018 redesign\n\n[edit]\n\nThe redesign of the Snapchat app in early 2018 made changes for which many users were not happy.[93][94] Around 1.2 million people petitioned Snap, Inc. to roll back the redesign. Snap, Inc's reply makes no concessions, other than noting, \"We completely understand the new Snapchat has felt uncomfortable for many.\"[95][96][97]\n\nDue to the redesign and other market factors in 2018, such as the growth of Instagram Stories and WhatsApp Status,[98] Daily Active Users (DAU) of the app only rose 2% from Q4 2017. Snap, Inc. stock fell more than 15% in after-hours trading following the earnings report release.[99][100][101][102] Growth of daily active users slowed in Q1 2018, and the growth rate for Q2 2018 was \"planned to decelerate rapidly from Q1 levels.\"[103] Snap, Inc. has commented on the redesign, saying, \"We have also started to realise some of the positive benefits [of the redesign], including increased new user retention for older users.\"[103] Some publishers feel the turn towards the older demographic spells the end for the app.[104]\n\nData storage\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a December 2020 announcement, Google Cloud confirmed the development of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) it signed with Saudi Aramco. The update stated the possibility of exploring options to establish cloud services in Saudi, where it confirmed storing Snapchat data. The decision was contested by Access Now, a non-profit organization, and CIPPIC, a Canadian public interest technology law clinic. The firms objected to Google's decision of choosing Saudi Arabia as its new Google Cloud region overlooking an alarming record of human rights abuse and longstanding surveillance accusations. The firms claimed that placing the personal information of millions of Snapchat users there would put it under the jurisdiction of the government of Saudi Arabia, jeopardizing the security of the data.[105][106][107]\n\nCalifornia civil rights lawsuit\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 2024, Snap paid $15 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the California Civil Rights Department alleging that the company discriminated against female employees with respect to pay and promotions, failed to prevent workplace sexual harassment, and retaliated against women who complained.[108][109]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",

(NYSE: SNAP) announced today the pricing of $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior notes due 2033, or the notes, in a private offering that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. The sale of the notes is expected to close on February 14, 2025, subject to customary closing conditions.\n\nThe notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Snap and will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed in the future, jointly and severally, by each of Snap’s domestic subsidiaries that guarantees certain of its other indebtedness, if any, subject to certain exceptions. The notes will bear interest at a rate of 6.875% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2025. The notes will mature on March 1, 2033 unless earlier repurchased or redeemed.\n\nMoody’s Ratings has assigned a “B1” rating with a positive outlook to Snap and the offering of the notes. Fitch Ratings has assigned a “BB” rating with a stable outlook to Snap and the offering of the notes. Standard & Poor’s has assigned a “B+” rating with a stable outlook to Snap and the offering of the notes.\n\nSnap estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $1,475.0 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and estimated expenses payable by Snap. Snap intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase an aggregate principal amount of (i) $45.3 million of its outstanding convertible senior notes due 2026, or the 2026 notes, (ii) $797.4 million of its outstanding convertible senior notes due 2027, or the 2027 notes, and (iii) $800.0 million of its outstanding convertible senior notes due 2028, or the 2028 notes, for an aggregate repurchase price of $1,445.1 million. Snap intends to use the remaining net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions of complementary businesses, or other repurchases of Snap’s securities.\n\nIn addition, Snap expects that some or all of the holders of the 2026 notes, the 2027 notes, or the 2028 notes that it repurchases may purchase shares of Snap Class A common stock in open market transactions or enter into or unwind various derivatives with respect to Snap Class A common stock to unwind hedge positions that they have with respect to their investment in the 2026 notes, the 2027 notes, or the 2028 notes. These transactions, in turn, may place upward pressure on the trading price of Snap Class A common stock, causing Snap Class A common stock to trade at higher prices than would be the case in the absence of these purchases.\n\nThe notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. The notes will only be offered or sold to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act, and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.\n\nThis press release is not an offer to sell and is not soliciting an offer to buy any securities, nor will it constitute an offer, solicitation, or sale of the securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. Any offers of the notes will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum.\n\nAbout Snap Inc.\n\nSnap Inc. is a technology company. We believe the camera presents the greatest opportunity to improve the way people live and communicate. We contribute to human progress by empowering people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, about Snap and Snap’s industry that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.

      "# [13 Years at Snap Inc.](https://newsroom.snap.com/13-years-at-snap)\nDear Team,\n\nThank you so much for your extraordinary efforts and dedication to our business. Over the past year we successfully reversed two years of declining year-over-year revenue growth and are pacing towards record annual revenue. We built a sustainable cost structure, resulting in improved earnings and cash flow – again reversing two years of declines. We’ve made enormous progress growing our community to reach more than 850 million people, while growing content time spent +25% globally in Q2. Successful turnarounds are the exception and not the rule in business, and our progress to-date returning to growth is the result of your perseverance, focus, and teamwork. In the year ahead, we will prove that our progress is sustainable while further accelerating the growth of our advertising business and diversifying our revenue with Snapchat+.\n\nYou may be wondering why, with all of the progress we’ve made in our business over the last year, our share price performance has lagged the overall market. The answer is simple: our advertising business is growing slower than our competitors. The growth of our digital advertising business is one of the most important inputs to our long term revenue potential, and investors are concerned that we aren’t growing faster. Our lower growth rate reflects the ongoing evolution of our advertising business from one primarily driven by a small number of large customers spending against brand-oriented upper funnel goals to one that has a greater balance among different advertiser types and goals, with a much larger number of small- and medium-sized customers who are bidding against lower funnel goals. This evolution is well underway: In Q2, even as our upper funnel brand revenue declined by 1%, our lower funnel direct response revenue grew by 16%.\n\nOver the years, we have found that lower funnel revenue generated by small- and medium-sized customers is more predictable and stable than upper funnel revenue. It also represents a larger long term opportunity for revenue growth. Lower funnel revenue is ‘stickier’ because it is more closely tied to key business objectives and positive returns on ad spend, and as its scale increases it becomes more predictable because it is diversified across a larger number of advertisers and sectors. As we have learned from navigating the volatile macroeconomic environment, our business will be more resilient if more of our revenue is generated from a larger number of advertisers focused on lower funnel goals. With active advertisers more than doubling year over year in Q2, we’ve made a lot of progress, but there is more work to do.\n\nAs we look ahead to 2025, we need to grow our lower funnel business even faster while simultaneously reaccelerating the growth of our upper funnel business. We’re going to do that by changing the way that we go to market, introducing new ad placements powered by automation, and continuing to invest in our machine learning platform to deliver powerful results for our advertising partners.\n\nWhen we first introduced vertical video ads they were a novel and unique offering, but today this format has been embraced by most of our competitors. That means vertical video is less differentiated than it once was, and despite our unique and unduplicated reach in many of the world’s largest digital advertising markets, we need to further evolve our ad products and strategy to stand out. Unlike our competitors, we offer a lot more than a content platform. People use Snapchat to communicate with their friends and family, use our camera and Lenses, peruse their Memories, see what their friends and family are up to on the Snap Map, and more. Despite the many and differentiated ways that people use our service, we’ve historically focused our go-to-market efforts on the vertical video ad format within our content offerings. There is a significant opportunity to better surface insights based on the unique ways that people use Snapchat, generate actionable recommendations for advertisers, and deliver better outcomes by leveraging new ad placements across our service.\n\nIn the coming months, we’re going to start surfacing more unique and actionable insights to advertisers based on the diversity of engagement on Snapchat. Privacy-safe insights around store visitation powered by the Snap Map, interactions with Lenses through our camera, and public content posts in Stories and Spotlight can help advertisers drive better performance and engagement with our community. Today, many of these insights are only accessible through disparate tools that made it harder to serve our advertising partners. Bringing these insights together into a single, self-serve tool and helping convert them into actionable recommendations will allow us to demonstrate the power of our differentiated platform to advertisers while giving them the tools they need to resonate with the Snapchat community.\n\nIn addition to differentiated insights, we are also experimenting with two new ad placements: Sponsored Snaps and Promoted Places. These placements will help us meet the goals of our advertising partners by aligning our unique insights with differentiated solutions to drive return on investment across Snapchat. Importantly, both of these placements are designed to leverage the same full-screen vertical video Snap Ad format already used across Snapchat so that advertisers can automate placement across our service without having to develop bespoke creatives.\n\nSponsored Snaps empower advertisers to communicate visually with the Snapchat community, making the core functionality of Snapchat accessible to advertisers. Sponsored Snaps appear in the chat inbox as a new Snap without a push notification, and opening the message is optional. This allows advertisers to engage prospective customers all the way down the funnel all within a single ad unit; raise awareness with broad reach in the chat inbox, improve consideration with people who choose to view the Snap, and drive conversion with an in-message call-to-action. As we continue to evolve Sponsored Snaps, we are excited to enable more messaging features powered by generative AI and integrated into advertiser CRMs to help our partners communicate with their customers at scale. As always, your conversations with friends are private and are not used for advertising purposes.\n\nWith more than 350 million people using the Snap Map, we now offer one of the most used maps on mobile. Instead of using our map to get directions from A to B, people use the Snap Map to see what their friends are up to, explore new places, and keep track of their favorite spots. We’ve also found that places highlighted on the map can drive incremental visitation. For example, there is a typical visitation lift of 17.6% for frequent Snap users shown Top Pick-annotated places, relative to users shown a place without an annotation. With Promoted Places, businesses can use the Snap Map to reach incremental customers who are exploring places nearby and easily measure the visitation lift with our closed-loop and privacy-safe measurement.\n\nWe’ve made tremendous progress improving our advertising platform over the past year, growing our investment in ML infrastructure and building larger models using fresher data. We will continue to invest in our ML engineering team and infrastructure to better utilize privacy-safe signals, further consolidate our models to improve performance and reduce operational burden, improve cold start, and develop new model architectures with better feature representations. We will focus on key product offerings like dynamic product ads, app objectives, target cost bidding, and value optimization. We will help advertisers better optimize for in-session conversions and remove friction from the purchase flow by making it easier for Snapchatters to make purchases in-app. All of these investments will be enhanced by new, simplified, and automated tools to streamline buying across different placements, enable intelligent audience expansion, and optimize budgets across ad sets to maximize campaign performance.\n\nThe growth of our advertising business is only possible because our community loves to use Snapchat. Our product strategy has been inspired in part by In-N-Out Burger. In-N-Out has developed a loyal following by using high quality ingredients, focusing on doing a few things exceptionally well, and obsessing over customer satisfaction to deliver an excellent customer experience. Their hamburger, cheeseburger, and Double-Double are our Snapping, chatting, and watching Stories. You can decide which parts of our product are the milkshake, fries, and secret menu. We’ve learned the benefits of focusing on our core product experiences and making them truly great, and this year we intend to double-down on what is working.\n\nThe way we grow our community is by enabling Snapping. Visual communication is at the heart of what we do, it’s universally appealing - fast, fun, and deeply expressive. Snapping brings people together in ways that no other medium of communication yet invented has been able to do, and in doing so makes people feel happier and closer to their friends and family. This year we will continue to make it easier for people to start Snapping and chatting with their friends and family. We know that Snapping is a key driver of retention and frequency of using Snapchat, and most importantly - it makes a positive impact.\n\nGenerative AI has been transformative for our camera and Lens experiences, empowering people to express themselves in a Snap. Our AI Lenses are already some of the most used Lenses on Snapchat, and our on-devices model will allow us to further scale these experiences with faster generation and lower cost. This year brings many more opportunities to further improve identity preservation in generative Snaps, enable generative video experiences, and help people reinterpret and reimagine their Memories in new ways. Our innovation in generative AI isn’t limited to the camera. Teams across Snap have been embracing multimodal LLMs, powering everything from My AI to new trust and safety tools. Everyone at Snap should brainstorm ways that generative AI can make our business more efficient and better at serving our community. If you have an idea, we want to hear about it!\n\nThe growth we’ve observed in our content business this year has primarily resulted from improvements to personalization and increases in content supply, especially from creators of public Stories and Spotlight videos. We’ve been testing a combined content experience that brings together Stories and Spotlight into one full screen and easy-to-navigate interface. This helps improve the discoverability of new creators and content genres by moving beyond the tile-based discovery we offer today in Discover. We’re also testing a further simplified version of Snapchat that aims to improve accessibility and usability. While early tests have been directionally positive, we will be thoughtful and deliberate about making a change of this magnitude. Rolling out this simplified version of Snapchat should also provide new opportunities to improve application performance and load times.\n\nWe’ve also been working hard to help creators realize their full potential on Snapchat. Creators often share that they value Snapchat because of the relationship that they are able to develop with their audience through tools like Story replies. This year we are working on new ways for brands to collaborate with creators to develop unique ad creative and promote their products. We’re proud of the significant revenue share that we provide to creators and publishers and these new brand collaboration tools will offer further opportunities for creators to benefit from their creativity and reach on Snapchat. We’ll have more to share at our upcoming Snap Partner Summit on September 17th.\n\nThe reason that I’ve dedicated so much of my life to building Snap is because I believe deeply in the power of technology to make a positive impact in people’s lives. Over the past 250 years, the productivity gains resulting from continual technological advancements have driven the most extraordinary increase in overall human well-being in history. I worry that the techno-utopianism brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, when people were overly reliant on the Internet to live their lives, has given way to a regressive and alarmist moral panic about technology that threatens further societal progress. We need a balanced approach to, and a healthy relationship with, the technological advancements that improve our lives.\n\nWe believe that the responsibility to make a positive impact with technology begins with our own actions and I am so profoundly proud of our team for contributing in a positive way through the service we provide. New independent research validates what we have long known about Snapchat and how we are different from social media:\n\nRecent research 1 from the Netherlands into adolescent use of large social media platforms concludes that Snapchat is the only platform that positively impacts well-being. Snapchat also has a strong positive effect on friendships and no net negative effect on self-esteem. The researchers conclude that:\n\n\"We found a consistent negative impact of time spent on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube across all three mental health dimensions. Conversely, spending time on Snapchat positively affected friendship closeness and well-being but had no significant impact on self-esteem. Using WhatsApp had a notably strong effect on friendship closeness but no significant effect on well-being and self-esteem.\"\n\n\"The positive and null effects associated with Snapchat and WhatsApp indicate that we should avoid a blanket condemnation of all social media platforms.\"\n\n\"Given their widespread and frequent use among adolescents, the negative effects of TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram on well-being, self-esteem, and friendship closeness are highly concerning. These particular platforms employ advanced algorithms to curate personalized content, capturing users’ attention and keeping them continuously engaged. These algorithms can draw users into a near-hypnotic cycle of infinite scrolling. And indeed, nearly half of adolescents report that they use social media much longer than intended, leading to feelings of time wasted and time taken away from other valued activities. Consequently, the design of these platforms may play a critical role in adversely affecting adolescents’ mental health. Therefore, more research is urgently needed to explore how specific design features may contribute to – and can potentially counteract – these negative outcomes.\"\n\nAs part of the Australian Parliament’s investigation into social media and Australian society, three Australian mental health organizations recently jointly submitted research results 2 to Parliament with similar findings. These results were derived from The Future Proofing Study, Australia’s largest longitudinal study into youth mental health, and found that:\n\n\"[A] higher number of hours spent each day on TikTok was significantly associated with greater depression, anxiety, insomnia and disordered eating. A higher number of hours on Instagram was associated with greater depression and anxiety. However, a higher number of hours on Snapchat was not found to be significantly associated with any of the mental health symptoms examined….\n\nThe differences between these apps are attributed to differences in the way that adolescents use them. The study showed that more frequently using social media to passively consume content was associated with higher symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and disordered eating. The design of TikTok and Instagram encourages its users to passively consume content; using algorithms to deliver its users targeted content and various features such as ‘infinite scroll’ that keep its users engaged for long periods of time. By contrast, the study found no evidence to indicate that using social media to facilitate social connections was associated with poorer mental health. Rather, it found that more frequently using social media to communicate with people teens knew in real life was associated with lower symptoms of depression and anxiety. This may explain why higher number of hours using Snapchat was not associated with any of the mental health symptoms examined, because Snapchat is a messaging app that adolescents primarily use to communicate with their friends.\"\n\nThis doesn’t mean that bad things can’t happen when people use Snapchat. That’s why we’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars in our trust and safety teams over the past several years and designed our service to help keep people safe by moderating content and only allowing people to communicate with the friends they’ve selected. We’ll continue these investments, leveraging powerful large language models to help us scale moderation with higher accuracy. We’ve also developed new resources for educators and parents to help them learn more about using Snapchat responsibly. Our work to keep our community safe is never done, and we will continue to dedicate ourselves to these efforts.\n\nDespite our extraordinary efforts to make the smartphones we use every day better by introducing vertical video, ephemeral messaging, Stories, Lenses, and more, we continue to bump up against the limitations of screens. Smartphone screens distract us from the real world, require us to use small touchscreens to express ourselves, and aren’t designed to be shared with friends. That’s why we’ve been working to build augmented reality glasses for over a decade. Glasses are already worn by billions of people and allow us to interact with the real world using see-through lenses. As Alan Kay said, “People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware” and we’ve been focused on enabling extraordinary new software experiences brought to life through Spectacles.\n\nOur efforts to build Spectacles are part of what the business school crowd calls Blue Ocean Strategy, a concept introduced by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne that describes new, unknown market space where there is no competitor and demand is created rather than fought over. Blue Ocean Strategy plays to our strengths as an innovator and leader in augmented reality. Interestingly, Kim and Mauborgne find “large R&D budgets are not the key to creating new market space. The key is making the right strategic moves. What’s more, companies that understand what drives a good strategic move will be well-placed to create multiple blue oceans over time, thereby continuing to deliver high growth and profits over a sustained period. The creation of blue oceans, in other words, is a product of strategy and as such is very much a product of managerial action.” Or, in other words, a product of things that are under our control.\n\nToday, the market for augmented reality glasses is nascent. While we continue to differentiate and win share in the highly competitive market for digital advertising (a “red ocean”), we are investing in creating augmented reality glasses that allow people to interact with computing, the world, and one another in totally new ways. Unlike in digital advertising, where we were a late entrant in a market with established, scaled players, we are a leader in the market for this new type of glasses and in the development of our augmented reality platform that is already used by hundreds of thousands of developers and hundreds of millions of Snapchatters.\n\nReflecting on the past two years, I am in awe of our team’s ability to navigate an incredibly challenging environment with resilience and determination. Sometimes the most important thing is survival, and our team and business adapted to major upheavals in mobile advertising, increased competition, international conflict, and a challenging and volatile macroeconomic environment with interest rates at their highest levels in more than two decades. Former USA and Duke basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski, known as Coach K, talks about the importance of leaders turning bad things into something that will work for the team. He says, “Don’t worry about losing. Think about winning. In other words, even when you have a loss, you must ask yourself, ‘What is good about this? How can I turn a defeat into something that works for us?’” When I think about our teams and leaders that have made the biggest impact over the past two years, they have always focused on creating opportunities and finding a way to win.\n\nAs we plan for the coming year, we can’t predict the future but we can extrapolate from what we know today. Economic data shows that the United States economy is slowing, with recession indicators like the yield curve and the Sahm Indicator flashing warning signs. Countries around the world are grappling with high debt loads and large ongoing budget deficits. Both US presidential candidates are floating new revenue raisers including tariffs and taxes, which could further slow economic growth. The rapidly evolving regulatory environment continues to strain our team, and new legislation around the world may introduce further compliance burdens if we get lumped in with other tech companies despite the different design choices we made while building our service. Court proceedings on the TikTok divestment legislation loom in the coming months.\n\nIn short, we must continue to expect the unexpected. The uncertainty we’re anticipating around the world further emphasizes the importance of diversified revenue streams including an advertising business serving a large number of advertisers bidding against lower funnel, direct response objectives, and subscription revenue from Snapchat+. It also means that we are investing conservatively against a baseline plan that assumes modest ad revenue growth, while we work towards higher growth rates. This means that in a downside scenario, we are still well positioned to generate free cash flow with our current cost structure. We’ve also taken steps to further fortify our balance sheet with more than $3 billion in cash and marketable securities and no meaningful debt maturities until 2027. We believe that this conservative approach allows our team to focus on driving the long term growth of our business without having to worry as much about external volatility.\n\nOne of the consequences of constrained resourcing in our functionally-organized business is that leaner teams must work even more closely together to get work done, which makes them more prone to conflict. This is especially relevant as we have worked through the enormous challenges of the past few years, where adverse outcomes make it harder for us to take accountability for our own actions, and easier to point fingers and blame others. It’s never been more important to clearly and rigorously prioritize our highest impact initiatives, and take shared goals across teams to drive more alignment.",
      "# [DHS Know2Protect and Snap Inc. Launch Innovative Virtual Resource to Educate Teens About Online Harms on 2024-10-01](https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/dhs-know2protect-and-snap-inc-launch-innovative-virtual-resource-educate-teens)\nWASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Know2Protect campaign has collaborated with Snap Inc. to introduce today the Know2Protect Snapchat Lens, an innovative virtual prevention tool aimed at helping teens identify and navigate online risks.\n\nKnow2Protect is the first federal campaign dedicated to preventing and educating about online child safety risks and has partnered with Snap Inc. to help spread awareness to one of the campaign’s key audiences: teens. Snapchat — Snap Inc.’s multimedia messaging platform — resonates strongly with teens and will provide an additional avenue for the campaign to bring important online safety information to this community directly.\n\n“The dangerous reality is that as safety protocols are put in place to protect children online, predators are already working to find ways around them,” said DHS Cyber Crimes Center Deputy Assistant Director Mike Prado. “Collaborative tools, like the one we are announcing today, help empower teens and young people with the information they need to stay one step ahead.”\n\nThe Snapchat Lens is designed to engage teens through a fun and interactive quiz format that poses true-false questions about online safety and how to prevent potential online harms. Snapchatters will be able to apply real-time effects and animations to their videos, transforming the learning experience into an entertaining adventure.\n\nBy leveraging Snapchat’s interactive features, the Know2Protect campaign aims to create memorable experiences that promote awareness of online risks.\n\n“Snap is honored to be a founding member of Know2Protect — an important initiative to educate teens and adults about online child exploitation,” said Snap Inc.’s Global Head of Platform Security Jacqueline Beauchere. “We are excited to see the launch of this engaging Lens on our platform, which will continue to amplify the campaign's message across the country.”\n\nIn addition to the Know2Protect lens, Snap Inc. amplified the campaign’s reach through donated paid media, by promoting the lens on Snapchat. The lens will also be promoted on Know2Protect’s owned social media channels. Additionally, Snap is conducting ongoing research with teens aged 13 to 17 and young adults aged 18 to 24 in the United States about the various dimensions of child sexual exploitation and abuse online, which will help to further inform the campaign.\n\n“The Know2Protect Snapchat Lens equips teens with important information about online safety in an interactive way. We encourage parents and trusted adults to also check it out. This feature can jumpstart sometimes difficult but necessary conversations with teens about online safety,” said Know2Protect Campaign Director Kate Kennedy.\n\nTo access the free Know2Protect Snapchat Lens:\n\nOpen the Lens Explorer in Snapchat.\n\nUse the search icon when the carousel is active and type in Know2Protect.\n\nSwipe on the carousel and tap the Know2Protect lens.\n\nFor more information visit https://help.snapchat.com, Know2Protect.gov or @Know2Protect on Instagram, Facebook and X.",
      "# [New Mexico’s attorney general files a suit saying Snapchat allows child sexual extortion by Barbara Ortutay, apnews.com, barbara-ortutay on 2024-09-05](https://apnews.com/article/new-mexico-snapchat-attorney-general-sextortion-teens-1a1c4c856a24d15631f26bb69e0f4c74)\nAP Technology Writer (AP) — New Mexico’s attorney general has filed a lawsuit against the company behind Snapchat, alleging that site’s design and policies foster the sharing of child sexual abuse material and facilitate child sexual exploitation.\n\nAttorney General Raúl Torrez filed the lawsuit against Snap Inc. Thursday in state court in Santa Fe. In addition to sexual abuse, the lawsuit claims the company also openly promotes child trafficking, drugs and guns.\n\nLast December, Torrez filed a similar lawsuit against Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, saying it allows predators to trade child sexual abuse material and solicit minors for sex on its platforms. That suit is still pending.\n\nSnap’s “harmful design features create an environment where predators can easily target children through sextortion schemes and other forms of sexual abuse,” Torrez said in a statement. Sexual extortion, or sextortion, involves persuading a person to send explicit photos online and then threatening to make the images public unless the victim pays money or engages in sexual favors.\n\n“Snap has misled users into believing that photos and videos sent on their platform will disappear, but predators can permanently capture this content and they have created a virtual yearbook of child sexual images that are traded, sold, and stored indefinitely,” Torrez said.\n\nIn a statement, Snap said it shares Torrez’s and the public’s concerns about the online safety of young people.\n\n“We understand that online threats continue to evolve and we will continue to work diligently to address these critical issues,” the company based in Santa Monica, California, said. “We have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in our trust and safety teams over the past several years, and designed our service to promote online safety by moderating content and enabling direct messaging with close friends and family.”\n\nAccording to the complaint, minors report having more online sexual interactions on Snapchat than any other platform, and more sex trafficking victims are recruited on Snapchat than on any other platform.\n\nPrior to the lawsuit, New Mexico conducted a monthslong undercover investigation into child sexual abuse images on Snapchat. According to Torrez’s statement, the investigation revealed a “vast network of dark web sites dedicated to sharing stolen, non-consensual sexual images from Snap,” finding more than 10,000 records related to Snap and child sexual abuse material in the last year. This included information related to minors younger than 13 being sexually assaulted.\n\nAs part of the undercover investigation, the New Mexico department of justice set up a decoy Snapchat account for a 14-year-old named Heather, who found and exchanged messages with accounts with names like “child.rape” and “pedo_lover10.”\n\nSnapchat, the lawsuit alleges, “was by far the largest source of images and videos among the dark web sites investigated.” Investigators also found Snapchat accounts that openly circulated and sold child abuse images directly on the platform.",

I have two suggestions for you to consider. If you would get back to me, that would be greatly appreciated. But I understand how busy your company is. So my first suggestion is whenever somebody posts on their story. I always feel the need to like text them and say, “Looks fun!” Or if its like a vacation post say “woah” etc. Do you think adding a comment or like button for stories? Maybe you can have a feature where you could turn it off and keep it on, for people who don’t desire to have it. My second suggestion is I would really love for me to be able to pick up my best friends list because it would be really nice to have like my most important people like on it instead of like just the people that I snap the most. Because it also could be like how fast they answer me. I’m sure you’ve gotten this request but like I have this random girl on my best friends list, and like I would rather have one of my good friends. Thank you so much for your time, and please take this into consideration. Have a great Super Bowl Sunday, and thank you so much for reading! My user is emmy_j3336\n\nJolena.T ,\n\nPretty great app for talking, but i think they should add more\n\nThis is my first time writing a review for a app, so i’m just trying it out and hoping Snapchat takes this suggestions. So this app is pretty good, you can add multiple friends, use funny filters and etc. It’s a great talking app, and it’s something I use in my everyday life, talking to friends and keeping up my streaks. I’ve seen the new updates like Snap+ which i think is cool but not necessary, though I do like having it.\n\nSomething that popped into my mind though is them maybe being able to have a button that can clear all saved messages (bc you can save things into chat and it won’t get deleted after 24 hr) instead of going through the chat and unclicking all of them. I think this is useful for someone who wants to start a fresh chat or doesn’t want to have past convos on there.(Ex: Their past convos w their ex that they still have added or smth and they are too lazy to go through months worth of convos). I think this would be a cool feature since I honestly don’t want to go through all the trouble. I know they added a button that can automatically save all chats so why not have one that does the opposite you know? But other then that, i think that’s it. Irs a pretty cool app and even though some people might have trouble with it, i like it as long as you’re careful not to add creeps and stuff",
