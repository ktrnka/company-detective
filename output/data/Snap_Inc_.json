On Snapchat, every day can be a celebration of friendship and community. Snapchatters communicate with pictures of themselves or of what they’re doing, and a lot of the time, Lenses are a part of that. With the ability to personalize Snapchat Lenses with the dynamic Friends API, we have seen an abundance of funny and creative Lenses featuring beloved Bitmoji avatars. So we have added even more custom components and other updates that help you create these inherently personal Lenses featuring your friends and family, and your Bitmoji. Let’s take a look at the new features and custom components we added to the Asset Library recently.\n\nThe Friends Carousel allows you to easily feature a carousel-view of the Snapchatter’s friends. This way, a Snapchatter can swipe through Bitmoji avatars to choose a friend that best suits the Lens. We also added the UI Carousel custom component, which is a generic version of the same UI shown here.\n\nWith an update to the Friends component, you can make sure that when a Snapchatter replies with the Lens in a chat, the featured Bitmoji avatars in the Lens are specific to the friend they’re talking to. Talk about relevant! Bitmoji avatars can also render shadows now too. And when you’re building a Lens with the Friends API, instead of seeing a default Bitmoji avatar in the preview screen of Lens Studio, you’ll now see your own avatar's stickers, as long as you’re logged in. Be sure to download the latest Lens Studio release for all the updates.\n\nThere’s so many opportunities to make friendship-focused Lenses that promote communication and love between friends on Snapchat. On International Friendship Day, we hope you feel inspired to tell your friends how much they mean to you! Make your own or try sending these 🤗",

And from there, easily publish to a global audience on Snapchat and beyond. This hassle-free pathway between the tools provides a more enjoyable developer experience overall. Let’s see what some Lens Creators are already saying about it and what they’ve been creating.\n\n\"Until now, exporting PNG images one by one from Figma and then importing them into Lens Studio was quite challenging,” says Lens Creator, Aoe. “However, using the new plugin made the process much easier, completing both material and texture setup instantly, which was very convenient.\"\n\nCheck out AOE’s very ~aesthetic~ Polaroid Lens, created with Figma designs and Lens Studio.\n\nLens Creator, Hongwei Tang sees obvious use for the plugin as it relates to gaming Lenses. “The Figma Importer is ideal for creating graphic elements for games and quickly integrating them into Lens Studio,\" says Tang.\n\nAlex Bradt, Owner of the production studio MousePack, finds that designing UI with his team will now be incredibly streamlined. “Figma and Lens Studio are both top design tools; this integration brings them together,” says Bradt. “Copy and pasting design elements is extremely satisfying. [The Figma Importer] is an essential tool for UI.”\n\nAs you can see, Lens Creators are thrilled with the efficiency and speed this plugin affords them. In an instant, you can transform your idea from screen to 3D scene, like applying your favorite Bitmoji sticker to your face—luv it!\n\nIf you’re inspired by the Figma plugin, and want to create your own plugin for yourself and the Lens Studio community, you can follow documentation and best practices for creation.

After several emails and a single unhelpful response, I’m left wondering if anyone is actually there to help. If I’ve unknowingly done something wrong, I’d appreciate some clarity and a solution. This experience has been quite disappointing, and I hope you can finally provide the support needed to resolve this issue.",

I use snapchat on the daily and one thing I noticed is that certain items in the clothing section to dress up your avatar you have to pay for. I know it’s been there for a while but I didn’t care about it a whole a lot until I was writing this review and it crossed my mind. Why should we have to pay $2 or any money at all just for a jacket for your avatar? Snapchat already makes a lot of money so I feel like paying for that stuff is unnecessary. \n\nNow for the main reason I’m writing this review. I am a snapchat plus user and I use almost every feature accompanied by snap+. But one thing I think would make having snapchat plus more enjoyable is being able to save your previous AI backgrounds. I use this feature a lot and love creating new fun prompts but sometimes when I choose a new one, sometime later I want my old one back. But I can’t get the exact picture back and instead have to recreate it somehow to get the closest thing to it because I can’t save them.

So, hoping to avoid or fix this issue. I updated my app today and now the cameos/avatar, but not your Bitmoji specifically the cameos are completely missing from the chat toolbar and the only way I can even see that they exist is to create a snap and add a cameo as a sticker, but I can no longer prompt in chat with a word or phrase and click the side icon it will only give me graphics or Bitmoji a NO CAMEOS and the cameo tab is missing completely. Was this on purpose? Please put it back.

Also you should make it so that regular users can change the app icon I don’t think that I would pay money just to do what snap plus features have now my opinion you should make it so that snap plus members can decrease their snap score and customize more things like the app background and not just the bottom taskbar.

Everything else has been changed my phone number my email and all that they require to reset my password and I’m honestly wondering what legal action there is for me to take here because everything I lost.",

I use snapchat on the daily and one thing I noticed is that certain items in the clothing section to dress up your avatar you have to pay for. I know it’s been there for a while but I didn’t care about it a whole a lot until I was writing this review and it crossed my mind. Why should we have to pay $2 or any money at all just for a jacket for your avatar? Snapchat already makes a lot of money so I feel like paying for that stuff is unnecessary. \n\nNow for the main reason I’m writing this review. I am a snapchat plus user and I use almost every feature accompanied by snap+. But one thing I think would make having snapchat plus more enjoyable is being able to save your previous AI backgrounds. I use this feature a lot and love creating new fun prompts but sometimes when I choose a new one, sometime later I want my old one back. But I can’t get the exact picture back and instead have to recreate it somehow to get the closest thing to it because I can’t save them. This is just a suggestion (one I highly recommend), but for snapchat plus users like me, this feature would be pretty nice.",

So, hoping to avoid or fix this issue. I updated my app today and now the cameos/avatar, but not your Bitmoji specifically the cameos are completely missing from the chat toolbar and the only way I can even see that they exist is to create a snap and add a cameo as a sticker, but I can no longer prompt in chat with a word or phrase and click the side icon it will only give me graphics or Bitmoji a NO CAMEOS and the cameo tab is missing completely.

      "# Post ID wf9nys: IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO BITMOJI/SNAP INC. with +17 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-08-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitmoji/comments/wf9nys/important_message_to_bitmojisnap_inc/)\nHey y’all, I am a user of Bitmoji, and I have been using that app for a very long time now, but there are important things I gotta get off my chest! First of all, besides just piercings, please add new jewelry such as necklaces (especially one with a cross on it, because so many people around the world, including me, are Christians, and we worship God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit) and bracelets, there can’t just be random face piercings! Second, please add braces and misaligned teeth (especially tooth gaps) because there are especially so many middle schoolers who have braces, and there are people who have misaligned teeth. Third, why don’t you add some new hairstyles, especially medium-length hairstyles because a lot of girls cannot even find their real hairstyles on your own app, I mean, there aren’t enough options, and there needs to be a wider variety of hairstyles because so many people have downloaded your own app. Fourth, please add some new clothing, especially clothing from Vineyard Vines, Lululemon, Lilly Pulitzer, Southern Marsh, Simply Southern, etc., also the 4th of July was a month ago, and y’all were supposed to add American-themed options for our Bitmojis, but y’all did not listen to us because I bet y’all just couldn’t get over with Pride Month because you think that there are way more genders than just male and female, whereas there are only two genders created by God, and y’all need to add some more flannel shirts, along with sports jerseys (Football, basketball, baseball, softball, cheerleader outfits, etc.) more suits for guys & more dresses for girls (especially whenever they have homecoming, winter formals, or even prom), and add some swimsuits/bathing suits, plus there’s more variety out in the world of fashion than just Black Lives Matter BS, especially clothing, plus BLM and Antifa are corrupt organizations that are about to become a thing of the past, y’all need to admit that there’s many preppy people all over the world! Fifth, there are only just 3 options for lips, why not add some more options, even just 6 options is more than just 3, also, why don’t y’all add some abs for our Bitmojis because so many people hit the gym all the time, add some more body types like pregnant women, Cellulite (which is very common in women), etc. because there are more than just 6 body types in the world, and why don’t y’all add some muscles to our Bitmojis, y’all can’t have just weak Bitmojis, also why not add some birth marks so that we can know what age the Bitmoji is! Sixth and final, on many stickers celebrating Holidays, y’all don’t even include Christian Stickers like for example, many people say “Merry Christmas” & admit that Jesus Christ was born on Christmas Day, but y’all just say “Happy Holidays” & only care about a sticker with presents under the tree just because y’all don’t even care about God like we do, y’all care so much about Muslim Holidays, Pride Month, Jewish Holidays, so many other religions and even irreligious/atheist/agnostic stickers, so why not add some Christian Bitmoji stickers, also for Easter, the only Easter-related thing y’all care about is the Easter Bunny who gives you candy, whereas Easter was the Resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and the lack of Christian-themed Bitmoji Stickers make a lot of Christians really mad and angry, including me!\n\nI hope y’all understand what I just said, now read this review, and then improve on your customization options, you have made so many people including me angry, Bitmoji!\n\n## Comment ID ilp8uh9 with +7 score by [(p4stelisqt, Reddit, 2022-08-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitmoji/comments/wf9nys/important_message_to_bitmojisnap_inc/ilp8uh9/) (in reply to ID wf9nys):\nbro what 💀\n\n## Comment ID iz8fyil with +5 score by [(deletus_my_fetus, Reddit, 2022-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitmoji/comments/wf9nys/important_message_to_bitmojisnap_inc/iz8fyil/) (in reply to ID wf9nys):\nI agree that there should be more options for customization…\n\nBut why are you coming at it from the angle of “I’m Christian, so you must do everything exactly how I want it 😡”.

Those going into the office will have an advantage in accelerating their career and over time others will opt in to returning to the office to compete or they fade away. \n\n2.

Flexible hours and wfh days (though generally not full hybrid) were a thing long before COVID. No one’s checking badge logs or yelling at you if you get in at 9:02am. \n\nSo I think a lot of companies are that are going hybrid are really declaring a baseline policy and the reality will vary for individuals. One thing it does is set expectations that you do have to by physically present near an office, vs full remote where you could base in more places. \n\nI interviewed at a small quant hedge fund a while back and talked to someone pretty senior. They had a hybrid policy and he joked that he typically saw the engineers maybe once a week (in a way that he did not have any issue with that).

      "# Post ID 581s3x: Snap Inc. Stock with +55 score by [(whichtochooz, Reddit, 2016-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/581s3x/snap_inc_stock/)\nHello. I have incredible offers from Snap Inc. and Facebook, but I was wondering what the opinions are here. Snap is offering me a boat-load of RSUs (to the liking of ~$450k - backloaded at 10/20/30/40) with a very high salary to boot ($120,350). Facebook's total comp at the current stock price is ~$185k.\n\nMy decision at this point is primarily based on money. I have a Master's in AI, and the teams I'll be joining at both companies are both equally interesting to me. However, I'm having trouble determining how to value Snap's stock. There are several news articles claiming they plan on an IPO in March 2017 at $25 billion. The RSU's they're offering are based on the current valuation of ~16-18 billion, so I could potentially see closer to ~$800k in stock from Snap.\n\nNeedless to say, I'm very excited about potentially being able to acquire so much money in such a short period of time, but I'm having trouble finding information online about pre-IPO stock and what it's worth (assuming the company plans to IPO very soon).\n\n\n## Comment ID d8wsbfn with +39 score by [(temp20312414, Reddit, 2016-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/581s3x/snap_inc_stock/d8wsbfn/) (in reply to ID 581s3x):\nCongrats on your offers! One thing to remember is that Snap actually issues the stock the month that you join, so if you're joining after it ipos, you'll be receiving that much money. But otherwise, there will be a lot of fluctuation once it ipos so you could see its valuation between $20-30 billion. Also, there is not guarantee of it ipoing even though they have recently filed for ipo. If the market suddenly tanks then they will likely pull out of the filing. It seems like the market is doing decently right now so most likely this won't be an issue. If I were you and solely balancing the scales on money, then I would go to snap as you could be making between 500k-1million on the stock in 4 years.\n\n### Comment ID d8x379x with +17 score by [(secretWolfMan, Reddit, 2016-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/581s3x/snap_inc_stock/d8x379x/) (in reply to ID d8wsbfn):\nAgree.

Snapchat's location in Santa Monica is much nicer than Facebook's in Menlo Park.  There are houses in Los Angeles you could buy in your first year.  This would be pretty much impossible in Menlo Park or anywhere else in the Peninsula.  You could buy in Union City or San Leandro but the quality of life is far better in Los Angeles.\n\nUnlike most \"unicorns\", Snapchat is actually likely to IPO.  I think the offers are equivalent once you price in the risk of a drop in stock value once Snap Inc's financials are exposed to the world.\n\nAnother upside is being part of an engineering team in a company that is up and coming.\n\nBecause you didn't mention it, I assume you don't have kids.

If they can’t support those products or features, they have 2 choices= grow the rest of the teams to be able to support (which would come with more spending and more problems) or cut the team, since the company isn’t able to capitalize on the features and Products being released anyways.\n\nIn this economy, every company is leaning towards cuts over growth and trying to get to positive cash flow so that they don’t have to rely on really high interest rate credit.\n\n#### Comment ID k8tfwxy with +26 score by [(Disallowed_username, Reddit, 2023-11-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17swegy/anyone_from_snap_knows_the_real_reason_20_pms/k8tfwxy/) (in reply to ID k8ssusj):\nI can believe it. Too many PMs without good balance towards design and devs leads to meetings about things that never materialize. Also shorter distance from top to bottom increase speed, so if higher up PMs have enough time to do the work, it will improve decission making since fewer chefs need to agree on whats for supper.\n\n#### Comment ID k8u89np with +1 score by [(GazBB, Reddit, 2023-11-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17swegy/anyone_from_snap_knows_the_real_reason_20_pms/k8u89np/) (in reply to ID k8ssusj):\n>speed up decision making”.\n\nWhat do you expect them to say?\n\n\" *We messed up and hired too many people who had no clue what needs to be done*\"?\n\nSnap is not really a tech company not like Meta.

Loosely speaking R&D to me is the initial creation of turning ideas to prototypes and getting it to generally work in the wild. \n\nPMs and product go way past that. In theory each ‘product’ goes thru stages of evolution from inception to evolving to peak relevance and ability to add value to users to eventually retiring it when no longer useful. Every step of its life requires research to ensure it evolves to something valuable, then downgraded appropriately for something else. \n\nSo as long as the product is relevant and there is a perception that there is more room to advance it, PMs can be potentially employable.\n\n#### Comment ID k8uxk6t with +1 score by [(buddyholly27, Reddit, 2023-11-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17swegy/anyone_from_snap_knows_the_real_reason_20_pms/k8uxk6t/) (in reply to ID k8u28p2):\nThey mean product development not greenfield research btw\n\n### Comment ID k8vdzc5 with +2 score by [(dementeddigital2, Reddit, 2023-11-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17swegy/anyone_from_snap_knows_the_real_reason_20_pms/k8vdzc5/) (in reply to ID k8sqoga):\nAnd then you get creamed when market conditions change.

Maybe the skin tone sample is adjusted to look more natural based on each level of lighting within the grid it's tracking.\n\n### Comment ID j5paasg with +1 score by [(vestlen, Reddit, 2023-01-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/snapcamera/comments/10e5y85/building_a_snap_camera_alternative_for_streamers/j5paasg/) (in reply to ID j4ttg7f):\nSecond this one.

I use snapchat on the daily and one thing I noticed is that certain items in the clothing section to dress up your avatar you have to pay for. I know it’s been there for a while but I didn’t care about it a whole a lot until I was writing this review and it crossed my mind. Why should we have to pay $2 or any money at all just for a jacket for your avatar? Snapchat already makes a lot of money so I feel like paying for that stuff is unnecessary. \n\nNow for the main reason I’m writing this review. I am a snapchat plus user and I use almost every feature accompanied by snap+. But one thing I think would make having snapchat plus more enjoyable is being able to save your previous AI backgrounds. I use this feature a lot and love creating new fun prompts but sometimes when I choose a new one, sometime later I want my old one back. But I can’t get the exact picture back and instead have to recreate it somehow to get the closest thing to it because I can’t save them. This is just a suggestion (one I highly recommend), but for snapchat plus users like me, this feature would be pretty nice.",

It was a simple picture about trans rights???????????? \nI literally was on Snapchat last night and I’m seeing 15-year-old kids selling drugs with these Childish “menus” to buy drugs and seeing the actual women, barely close on bikinis that look like dental floss, but a trans woman post one picture of her face stating that trans. Rights are human rights and all of a sudden her account is locked. It’s so crazy that I can’t even appeal. The decision.???????? BECAUSE IM TRANS!!!!!!!!!!!

It feels really disconnected to be alerted about updates from my friends but not be able to engage with their content. \nI've tried troubleshooting by refreshing my app, checking my settings, and even reinstalling it, but nothing seems to work. It’s disappointing, especially since part of the fun of Snapchat is seeing what my friends are up to in real-time. \nI hope this issue can be addressed in future updates, as it’s a major part of what makes Snapchat enjoyable. Until then, I can only give it a couple of stars for the notifications, which feel like a tease without the ability to view the stories. Here's hoping for a fix soon!\nThank you\n- a random person",

I don’t care what holiday it is. I don’t care about any of it. I find it incredible annoying that I have to clear out my chat because I don’t want it in my chat list.

So, hoping to avoid or fix this issue. I updated my app today and now the cameos/avatar, but not your Bitmoji specifically the cameos are completely missing from the chat toolbar and the only way I can even see that they exist is to create a snap and add a cameo as a sticker, but I can no longer prompt in chat with a word or phrase and click the side icon it will only give me graphics or Bitmoji a NO CAMEOS and the cameo tab is missing completely. Was this on purpose? Please put it back. Also, it would be incredibly helpful to be able to finish a snap and click out to another app and not worry that what I just sent will disappear and not go through.",

If I’m talking to her about a serious topic she just take that as a funny joke 5.

The day I opened snapchat and was SHOCKED TO MY CORE to see my favorite snapchat font MISSING from the font options. The gorgeous big black letters that just popped out from the florescent yellow background. That was all I ever needed in life. Snapchat, the AUDICITY you had to remove such an iconic and truly pivotal and quintessential font to so many is just so disheartening. I am willing to change my mind, Snapchat, if you are willing to bring back the one thing we snapchat users crave most. The yellow font.",

Recent layoffs within the company have been mishandled, resulting in insufficient support for mental health and a decrease in morale. Despite these challenges, the CEO and senior executives remain focused on Snap's potential to compete with TikTok and Meta. However, it must be acknowledged that the product and technology have significant flaws. Instead of investing in improving the advertising platform and rectifying these issues, which are pivotal in driving 95% of the company's revenue, the CEO prioritises funding a small yellow drone with a mere two-minute battery life. Additionally, Snap creators are compensated more generously than those on other platforms, possibly to create a false sense of community or activity.",

However, it must be acknowledged that the product and technology have significant flaws. Instead of investing in improving the advertising platform and rectifying these issues, which are pivotal in driving 95% of the company's revenue, the CEO prioritises funding a small yellow drone with a mere two-minute battery life.

      "# [Snapchat Privacy](https://values.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy)\nThis section provides you with details on what information we collect. We’ve organized this in a few categories: information you provide to us, information we generate based on your use of our Services, and information we receive from others. Sometimes, we may also collect additional information, with your permission.\n\nWhen you use our Services, such as Snapchat, we collect information you provide to us, generate information when you use our Services, and in some cases receive data from others. Let’s break these down in more detail.\n\nInformation You Provide\n\nMany of our Services require you to set up an account. To do this, we ask you to provide us with account details (information about you, like your name, username, email address, birthday, and phone number). When you set up your profile, you’ll also provide us with profile details (like your Bitmoji and profile picture). If you use our commerce products to buy something, like those latest sneakers, we may ask you for payment and related information (like your physical address, so we can ship the product to you, payment information, so we can process the payment, and transaction history).\n\nOf course, you’ll also provide us with the information you send through or save within our Services. We consider some of this information to be private content and communications (like Snaps and Chats with friends, My Story set to Friends, Private Stories, voice and video calls, and content that is saved in My Eyes Only). On the other end of the spectrum, some of the information you send through or save within our Services may be public content that is accessible to everyone (such as Public Story content, including My Story set to Everyone, Shared Stories, and Community Stories, Spotlight or Snap Map submissions, and Public Profile information). Keep in mind that Snapchatters who view your Snaps, Chats, and any other content, can always screenshot that content, save it, or copy it outside the Snapchat app. So please don’t send messages or share content that you wouldn’t want someone to save or share.\n\nLastly, when you contact Support (content and communications shared with Support) or our Safety team, or communicate with us in any other way, including through our research efforts (like responses to surveys, consumer panels, or other research questions) we’ll collect whatever information you provide or that we need to resolve your question.\n\nInformation We Generate When You Use Our Services\n\nWhen you use our Services, we collect information about which of those Services you’ve used and how you’ve used them. This helps us better understand the way our community uses our Services so that we can make improvements.\n\nThis includes usage information (information about how you interact with our Services — for example, which Lenses you view and apply, Stories you watch, and how often you communicate with other Snapchatters) and content information (information about content you create or provide, your engagement with the camera and creative tools, your interactions with My AI, and metadata — for example, information about the content itself like the date and time it was posted and who viewed it). Content information includes information based on the content of the image, video, or audio — so if you post a Spotlight of a basketball game, we may use that information to show you more content on Spotlight about basketball.\n\nThis also includes device information (such as your hardware or software, operating system, device memory, advertising identifiers, apps installed, browser type, information from device sensors that measure the motion of your device or compasses and microphones, including whether you have headphones connected, and information about your wireless and mobile connections), location information (IP address), information collected by cookies and similar technologies, depending on your settings, (cookies, web beacons (small graphic data that recognize user activity, such as if and how often a user has visited a website), web storage, unique advertising identifiers), and log information (such as details about how you’ve used our Services, access times, pages viewed, IP address, and unique identifiers like cookies).\n\nIf you’ve explicitly granted device-level permissions, device information may also include information about your device phonebook (contacts and related information), images and other information from your device’s camera, photos, and microphone (like the ability to take photos, videos, view stored photos and videos, and access the microphone to record audio while recording video), and location information (precise location through methods like GPS signals).\n\nData We Receive From Others\n\nThe last category of data we collect is information about you that we may receive from others, such as other users, our affiliates, and third parties. This includes linked third-party service data (information we get when you link your Snapchat account to another service), data from advertisers (information from advertisers, app developers, publishers, and other third parties to help target or measure the performance of ads), contact info from other Snapchatters or third parties (if another Snapchatter uploads their contact list which includes your information, we may combine that with other information we have about you to better understand who you may want to communicate with. Or, if you provide us with your contact information, we may use that to determine if we can communicate with you in other ways, like SMS, email, or other messaging services), and data relating to potential violations of our Terms (we may receive information from third parties, including website publishers, social network providers, law enforcement, and others, about potential violators of our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines).\n\nOther Information, With Your Permission\n\nAdditionally, there may be instances when you interact with our Services that we will ask your permission to collect additional information. For example, before accessing your device’s camera roll or Contact Book.\n\nThis section explains how we use the information we collect. Among other things, we use the information we collect to provide you with personalized products and Services that we work hard to build and improve. Below, we walk through each purpose for which we use information in detail. If you’d like to see a mapping of the data we collect with the purposes for which we collect it, we have a table here.\n\nKeep Things Up & Running (i.e., operate, deliver, and maintain our Services)\n\nWe use the information we collect in order to operate, deliver, and maintain our Services. For example, by delivering a Snap you want to send to a friend or, if you share your location on Snap Map, to show you suggestions like places you might like in your neighborhood, content others have posted to the Map, or your friends if they’re sharing their location with you. We also use some of your information to help keep our products up to date, for example to make sure that our Services work with the latest operating systems and devices.\n\nPersonalize Your Experience & Give Context\n\nWe offer personalized Services to Snapchatters. One of the ways we do this is by showing you content that is relevant to you or we think you may enjoy based on the information you share with us. To do so, we use information about you across different areas of the Services in order to add context to your Snapchat experience. For example, we automatically tag content with labels based on the content, your location, or the time of day. So if there's a dog in the photo, it may be searchable in Memories by the term “dog,” show up on the Map at the location where you created the Memory, and inform us that you’re into dogs so we can surface you fun dog videos and dog food ads in other parts of our Services, such as Spotlight.\n\nPersonalization can also help with suggesting friends or recommending a new friend to send a Snap to based on who you Snap with the most. We may show recommended places on the Snap Map, generate stickers, or even generate Snaps and other content using AI to share with friends, infer your interests based on your content or activity, or customize the content we show you, including ads. For example, if you watch barista content on Spotlight, talk to My AI about your favorite espresso machine, or save a lot of coffee-related Snaps in your Memories, we may highlight coffee shops on the Snap Map when you visit a new city or show you content about coffee that you may find interesting or relevant. Or, if you interact with a lot of music venues we may use that to show you ads for upcoming shows in town. Personalization also includes tailoring your experience based on what your friends are doing, including showing you content your friends create, like, or enjoy on Spotlight or Place recommendations that are popular with your friends.\n\nOur goal is to continuously provide you with more relevant and interesting content.\n\nFor example, if you watch a lot of sports content, but skip content with hair and makeup tips, our recommendation algorithms will prioritize sports, but not those makeup tips. You can learn more about how we understand Snapchatter preferences and rank and moderate content here.\n\nWe believe it is critical to also balance the benefits of personalization with our Snapchatters’ expectations of privacy. For example, we may automatically tag the Snaps you save to Memories based on the content within it (e.g., the Snap contained a dog), and then use that tag to personalize your experience, make recommendations, or show you ads (such as showing you Spotlight Snaps containing dogs). We do not use the private content and communications you send to your friends to personalize your experience, make recommendations, or show you ads.\n\nProvide Relevant Ads\n\nAnother way we provide a personalized Service is through the ads we show. We use your interests and preferences from the information we’ve collected to personalize, target, and measure ads. We think ads are best when they’re relevant. That’s why we try to select the right ads and show them to you at the right time. For example, if you’ve interacted with ads for video games, we will infer that you like video games, and show you similar ads, but those won’t be the only ads you see. Similar to our content strategy, we try to ensure you receive a variety of ads. We also use your information to avoid showing you ads you probably won’t be interested in. For example, if a ticketing site tells us you’ve previously bought tickets for a movie — we can stop showing you ads for it. You can learn about the different types of advertising and your choices about which ads you receive here.\n\nYou can learn more about how we collect, use, and share your information for advertising purposes here.\n\nA note about information collected by cookies and other technologies: we may use these technologies to collect information when you interact with Services we offer through one of our partners. For example, we may use information collected on an advertiser’s website to show you more relevant ads. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our Services. To learn more about how we and our partners use cookies on our Services and your choices, please check out our Cookie Policy.\n\nDevelop & Improve Features, Algorithms & Machine Learning Models\n\nOur teams are constantly coming up with new ideas for features and ways to improve our Services. In order to do this, we also develop and improve the algorithms and machine learning models (an expression of an algorithm that combs through significant amounts of data to find patterns or make predictions) that make our features and Services work, including through generative AI features (artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images, or other media, using generative models. Generative AI models learn the patterns and structure of their input training data and then generate new data that has similar characteristics). We use algorithms and machine learning models for personalization, advertising, safety and security, fairness and inclusivity, augmented reality, and to prevent abuse or other Terms of Service violations. For example, our algorithms and machine learning models take into account the conversations Snapchatters are having with My AI to improve the responses from My AI.\n\nYour information can help us decide what kind of improvements we should make, but we are always focused on privacy — and we don’t want to use more of your personal information than necessary to develop our features and models.\n\nAnalytics\n\nIn order to understand what to build or how to improve our Services, we need to understand trends and demand for our features. For example, we monitor metadata and trends about Group Chat use to help decide whether we should change parts of the feature, like the maximum size of a Group. Studying data from Snapchatters can help us see trends in the ways that people use the Services. This helps inspire us to improve Snapchat on a larger scale. We perform analytics in order to identify, monitor, and analyze trends and usage. Based on this information, we will, among other things, create information about our users to help us understand demand.\n\nResearch\n\nWe conduct research to better understand general consumer interests, trends, and how our Services are used by you and others in our community. This information, along with analytics (as we described above), helps us understand more about our community and about how our Services fit into the lives of those in our community. We also engage in research and development to develop new techniques and technologies (e.g., new machine learning models or hardware, such as Spectacles). The results of our research are sometimes used in features on Snapchat, and we sometimes publish papers about things like overall behaviors and consumer trends (which will only have aggregated data across our user base, and not contain any private information about you specifically).\n\nEnhance the Safety & Security of Our Services\n\nWe use your information to enhance the safety and security of our Services, verify Snapchatter identity, and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity. For example, we provide two-factor authentication to help protect your account and can send you email or text messages if we notice any suspicious activity. We also scan URLs sent on Snapchat to see if that webpage is potentially harmful, and can give you a warning about it.\n\nContacting You\n\nSometimes we’ll get in touch with you to promote new or existing features. This includes sending Snapchatters communications through Snapchat, email, SMS, or other messaging platforms, where permitted. For example, we may use the Snapchat app, email, SMS, or other messaging platforms to share information about our Services and promotional offers that we think may interest you.\n\nOther times, we need to communicate with you to provide information, alerts, or to send messages our users ask us to deliver at their request. This may include sending communications through Snapchat, email, SMS, or other messaging platforms, where permitted, to deliver account status updates, security alerts, and Chat or friending reminders; it may also include fulfilling our user’s request to send invites or Snapchat content to non-Snapchatters.\n\nSupport\n\nWhen you ask for help, we want to get you support as quickly as possible. In order to provide you, the Snapchatter community, and our business partners with the help needed to resolve issues with our Services, we often need to use the information we have collected to respond.\n\nEnforce Our Terms & Policies\n\nWe use the data we collect to enforce our Terms and the law. This includes enforcing, investigating, and reporting conduct that violates our Terms, policies, or the law, responding to requests from law enforcement, and complying with legal requirements. For example, when unlawful content is posted on our Services, we may need to enforce our Terms and other policies. In some cases, we may also use or share your information to cooperate with law enforcement requests, escalate safety issues to law enforcement, industry partners, or others, or comply with our legal obligations.

      "# [DHS Know2Protect and Snap Inc. Launch Innovative Virtual Resource to Educate Teens About Online Harms on 2024-10-01](https://www.dhs.gov/hsi/news/2024/10/01/dhs-know2protect-and-snap-inc-launch-innovative-virtual-resource-educate-teens)\nWASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Know2Protect campaign has collaborated with Snap Inc. to introduce today the Know2Protect Snapchat Lens, an innovative virtual prevention tool aimed at helping teens identify and navigate online risks.\n\nImage\n\nKnow2Protect is the first federal campaign dedicated to preventing and educating about online child safety risks and has partnered with Snap Inc. to help spread awareness to one of the campaign’s key audiences: teens. Snapchat — Snap Inc.’s multimedia messaging platform — resonates strongly with teens and will provide an additional avenue for the campaign to bring important online safety information to this community directly.\n\n“The dangerous reality is that as safety protocols are put in place to protect children online, predators are already working to find ways around them,” said DHS Cyber Crimes Center Deputy Assistant Director Mike Prado. “Collaborative tools, like the one we are announcing today, help empower teens and young people with the information they need to stay one step ahead.”\n\nThe Snapchat Lens is designed to engage teens through a fun and interactive quiz format that poses true-false questions about online safety and how to prevent potential online harms. Snapchatters will be able to apply real-time effects and animations to their videos, transforming the learning experience into an entertaining adventure.\n\nBy leveraging Snapchat’s interactive features, the Know2Protect campaign aims to create memorable experiences that promote awareness of online risks.\n\n“Snap is honored to be a founding member of Know2Protect — an important initiative to educate teens and adults about online child exploitation,” said Snap Inc.’s Global Head of Platform Security Jacqueline Beauchere. “We are excited to see the launch of this engaging Lens on our platform, which will continue to amplify the campaign's message across the country.”\n\nIn addition to the Know2Protect lens, Snap Inc. amplified the campaign’s reach through donated paid media, by promoting the lens on Snapchat. The lens will also be promoted on Know2Protect’s owned social media channels. Additionally, Snap is conducting ongoing research with teens aged 13 to 17 and young adults aged 18 to 24 in the United States about the various dimensions of child sexual exploitation and abuse online, which will help to further inform the campaign.\n\n“The Know2Protect Snapchat Lens equips teens with important information about online safety in an interactive way. We encourage parents and trusted adults to also check it out. This feature can jumpstart sometimes difficult but necessary conversations with teens about online safety,” said Know2Protect Campaign Director Kate Kennedy.\n\nTo access the free Know2Protect Snapchat Lens:\n\nOpen the Lens Explorer in Snapchat.\n\nUse the search icon when the carousel is active and type in Know2Protect.\n\nSwipe on the carousel and tap the Know2Protect lens.\n\nFor more information visit https://help.snapchat.com, Know2Protect.gov or @Know2Protect on Instagram, Facebook and X.",
      "# [New Features to Help Protect Our Community](https://values.snap.com/news/new-features-to-help-protect-our-community)\nToday we’re announcing our plans for new features to further safeguard our community from online harms. Our new suite of tools will include expanded in-app warnings, enhanced friending protections, simplified location-sharing, and blocking improvements – all designed to reinforce the real friend relationships that make Snapchat so unique.\n\nThese expanded features build on our ongoing work to make it difficult for strangers to contact people on Snapchat. For example, we don’t allow anyone to be messaged by someone they haven’t already added as a friend, or have in their phone contacts. In other words, Snapchatters must proactively select who they communicate with.\n\nToday we are introducing the upcoming tools to help keep our community safe:\n\nExpanded In-App Warnings\n\nLast November, we introduced a pop-up warning when a teen receives a message from someone they don’t already share mutual friends with or have in their contacts. The message informs teens of potential risk so they can carefully consider if they want to be in contact and reminds them to only connect with people they trust. Since launch, this feature has empowered millions of Snapchatters to take action, leading to more than 12 million blocks. 1\n\nNow we’re planning to expand these in-app warnings to incorporate new and advanced signals. Once launched, these features will prompt teens to see a warning message if they receive a chat from someone who has been blocked or reported by others, or is from a region where the teen’s network isn't typically located – signs that the person may be a scammer.\n\nEnhanced Friending Protections\n\nPreviously we shared that teens will not be suggested in Quick Add or Search unless they have multiple mutual connections with the other person. We are now adding new friending safeguards that, coupled with our expanded in-app warnings, make it much harder for strangers to find and add teens:\n\nWe will prevent delivery of a friend request altogether when teens send or receive a friend request from someone they don't have mutual friends with, and that person also has a history of accessing Snapchat in locations often associated with scamming activity. This applies regardless of whether the friend request was sent out by a teen, or sent to a teen from a potential bad actor.\n\nTaken together, these two updates continue our work to address a growing trend of sophisticated sextortion scams, committed by financially motivated bad actors, typically located outside the U.S. and interacting with potential victims across a combination of online platforms.\n\nThese updates build on our work to combat online sextortion: We have never offered public friend lists (which can be used to facilitate sextortion schemes), we use signal-based detection to identify and remove bad actors before they have the opportunity to target others, we have invested in global cross-platform research, and we collaborate with other platforms to combat this crime and other potential harms. We encourage Snapchatters to learn more through our educational resources, like our in-app Safety Snapshot on financial sextortion, and on our Privacy & Safety Hub.\n\nSimplified Location-Sharing and Additional Reminders\n\nWe send all Snapchatters – including teens – regular reminders to check their account security and privacy settings, and only allow Snapchatters to share their location with friends. Now we’re introducingmore frequent reminders to make sure that Snapchatters are always up to date on which friends they’re sharing their location with on the Snap Map. We’re also introducing simplified location-sharing, making it easier for Snapchatters to customize which of their friends can see their location. With these updates, Snapchatters have a single destination to see exactly which friends they are sharing their location with, update their location settings, and remove their location from the map.\n\nAs always, location sharing on the Snap Map remains off by default, meaning that Snapchatters have to proactively opt in to share where they are. And Snapchatters can only ever share their whereabouts with their existing Snapchat friends – there is no option to broadcast their location to the wider Snapchat community.\n\nBlocking Improvements\n\nWe have long offered tools for Snapchatters to easily block someone if they no longer wish to be in touch with them. Sometimes, bad actors create new accounts and continue to try to contact people who have blocked them. In an effort to prevent bullying and potential repeat harassment, we’re introducing improvements to our blocking tools: Blocking a user will also now block new friend requests sent from other accounts created on the same device.\n\nThese new tools build on our ongoing commitment to help Snapchatters communicate with their close friends in an environment that prioritizes their safety, privacy, and well-being. We look forward to continuing to create even more protections, tools, and resources to help protect our community.",

This should happen because I know that a lot of people would like to decrease their snap score and this should be an option because there is a snap score increasing option. Personally, I have many friends that would like if snapchat added a snap score decrease to their snapchat + options and they would also buy snapchat + just for that reason. I also agree that there should be an option to decrease your snap score because I would definitely buy snapchat + for that reason and so would many others. Also, if snapchat + already had an option to increase your snap score, it only makes sense that they would add a snap score decrease. This is because if people are already changing their snap score by making it higher through snapchat +, then they should be able to make it lower. Some ways that this could happen that the snap score could decrease by either 75%, 50%, or 25%. Also, they they could also make a way where you can take away 100,000 snap score or 200,000 snap score but only if you have that much snap score or else it wouldnât work. I feel like with a new snap score decreasing option, this would definitely make the app better because this would make people want to use it more frequently without worry of their snap score getting too high. Other than this, I think that snapchat is a really good app and I use it all the time!\n\nPuscilla ,\n\nGreat app but could use some changes.\n\nGreat app, but it could use some changes. When Iâm screen sharing the other person canât hear the sound from my screen. This is annoying because if Iâm calling someone who doesnât have much other socials then I canât screen share with sound on other platforms if they donât have any of them. Another thing that should be fixed is ultra wide on older phones, XR, and etc. It may just be the phone that doesnât have .5 itself but if itâs not and it just isnât provided for XR and the older iPhones including androids it should be added. Another thing is that there should be an option to get rid of the Snapchat AI. Itâs kind of creepy speaking that it can send me SNAPS? You can tell that there AI generated but itâs still creepy. Another thing is that you should be able to watch the Snapchat spotlights without wifi, Iâm not sure if that is possible but if it is, I would love that update as someone with no SIM card (strict parents) and donât have data. Another thing is there memories should have a password along with the my eyes only. One last thing there needs to be more clothing options most of them are low-key ugly(mb if Iâm being harsh) but itâs true. As a person who owns uggs(slippers) but there not there!!!!!! Just the Tasman uggs. Thatâs basically all I have to say. Good app though (one of my favorite apps.)",

It expects the majority of the costs to be incurred in the first quarter.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Snap has eliminated jobs. The Santa Monica, California-based company announced in August 2022 that it planned to cut about 20% of its global workforce.

For example, with Gemini on Vertex AI integrated into the app, Snapchatters can ask My AI to translate a photo of a street sign while traveling abroad, or take a video of different snack offerings to ask which one is the healthiest option.\n\nFirst launched on Google Cloud in 2011, Snapchat offers a fast, fun way to communicate visually with friends and family. The continued popularity of these core product values helps distinguish Snapchat from other internet platforms and has enabled the platform to grow to reach more than 850 million monthly active users.\n\nAs an innovator in the technology space, Snap is helping define how gen AI will help people express themselves, learn about the world, and connect with their friends and family. As the company continues to invest in AI, Snap is already seeing strong business value from its partnership with Google Cloud. Since Snapchat deployed Gemini on Vertex AI to support My AI, the company saw over 2.5x as much engagement within Snapping to My AI in the United States.\n\n\"This partnership with Google Cloud reinforces everything that's so important to serving our community. Snap is all about empowering people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together. Now with Gemini in My AI, Snapchatters can learn so much more about the world, do it really quickly in the moment, and easily share that with friends,\" said Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snap.\n\n\"Snap was an early leader in helping people communicate in a digital world, and now it is at the forefront of using generative AI to build agents that create new value for its community,\" said Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud. \"Gemini models on Vertex AI are now powering millions of multimodal interactions in the Snapchat app every day that allow Snapchatters to better engage with My AI — with built-in accuracy and safety features.\"\n\nSnap and Google Cloud's 10+ year partnership has continued to evolve, with Snap adopting Google Cloud's data, analytics, and AI/ML technologies to fuel growth and shape the customer experience. Multimodal capabilities powered by Google Cloud's generative AI technology are now live for all U.S. Snapchatters in My AI.\n\nAbout Google Cloud\n\nGoogle Cloud is the new way to the cloud, providing AI, infrastructure, developer, data, security, and collaboration tools built for today and tomorrow.

All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this press release, including statements regarding guidance, our future results of operations or financial condition, future stock repurchase programs or stock dividends, business strategy and plans, user growth and engagement, product initiatives, objectives of management for future operations, and advertiser and partner offerings, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “going to,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” or “would” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions. We caution you that the foregoing may not include all of the forward-looking statements made in this press release.\n\nYou should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this press release primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends, including our financial outlook, macroeconomic uncertainty, and geo-political events and conflicts, that we believe may continue to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties related to: our financial performance; our ability to attain and sustain profitability; our ability to generate and sustain positive cash flow; our ability to attract and retain users, partners, and advertisers; competition and new market entrants; managing our growth and future expenses; compliance with new laws, regulations, and executive actions; our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property; our ability to succeed in existing and new market segments; our ability to attract and retain qualified team members and key personnel; our ability to repay or refinance outstanding debt, or to access additional financing; future acquisitions, divestitures, or investments; and the potential adverse impact of climate change, natural disasters, health epidemics, macroeconomic conditions, and war or other armed conflict, as well as risks, uncertainties, and other factors described in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our most recent periodic report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, which is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will be made available in our periodic report that will be filed with the SEC for the period covered by this press release and other filings that we make from time to time with the SEC. In addition, any forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, including future developments related to geo-political events and conflicts and macroeconomic conditions, except as required by law.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nWe use the non-GAAP financial measure of Free Cash Flow, which is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, reduced by purchases of property and equipment. We believe Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available, after capital expenditures, for operational expenses and investment in our business and is a key financial indicator used by management. Additionally, we believe that Free Cash Flow is an important measure since we use third-party infrastructure partners to host our services and therefore we do not incur significant capital expenditures to support revenue generating activities. Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet and invest in future growth.\n\nWe use the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net income (loss), excluding interest income; interest expense; other income (expense), net; income tax benefit (expense); depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; payroll and other tax expense related to stock-based compensation; and certain other items impacting net income (loss) from time to time. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA helps identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nWe use the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP net income (loss), which is defined as net income (loss), excluding amortization of intangible assets; stock-based compensation expense; payroll and other tax expense related to stock-based compensation; certain other items impacting net income (loss) from time to time; and related income tax adjustments. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and weighted average diluted shares are then used to calculate non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share. Similar to Adjusted EBITDA, we believe these measures help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses we exclude in the measure.\n\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our financial performance, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by our management for financial and operational decision-making.
