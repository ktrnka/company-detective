      "# [Company — Carbon Robotics](https://carbonrobotics.com/company)\nCarbon Robotics is leading a revolution. Recent advances have unlocked the industry-reshaping potential of AI-powered robotics – specifically the combination of computer vision, AI/deep learning, and robotics. The first multi-billion applications will be in industries with specific use cases and defined dollar value.\n\nAgtech unlocks the potential of AI Robotics now. Farms are a controlled environment, every action has a dollar value, it’s a massive market, and growing food is a fundamental, global, and universal activity that human beings do for each other. Broadly, farmers do three things: planting, weeding, and harvesting. Of these, weed control is the biggest problem. It is their number one biggest annual expense and is non-discretionary, ubiquitous, and constant.\n\nTools today are very limited: farmers are forced to choose between using an immense amount of increasingly scarce and costly hand labor, spraying harmful chemicals, or using mechanical solutions that disrupt and destroy topsoil (think, the Dust Bowl). Herbicides are failing, and herbicide-resistant weeds are rapidly multiplying after 40 years of overspraying. Not only do the current tactics come with a set of issues, but there is also a limit to how long these tactics can last. Farmers are eager for an option that offers immediate economic savings, results in healthier higher quality crops, and that is sustainable and regenerative for the future.\n\nEnter Carbon Robotics - the first and only AI-powered LaserWeeder™.\n\nCarbon Robotics produces revolutionary AI-powered robotic systems that precisely identify, weed and thin specialty vegetable crops using lasers with millimeter accuracy, while observing the conditions of the crop and soil in a field for later analysis. Its technology reduces the use of herbicides in traditional farming, eliminates unnecessary tilling for regenerative farming, and in many cases eliminates the need for weeding crews of up to 75 people per field per LaserWeeder unit. Carbon Robotics has sophisticated AI/deep learning and over 8 million labeled crop and weed image objects that, in the weeding application, delineate between individual weeds and crops in order to eliminate only the weeds, all in real-time, at tractor speeds of 1-2 mph (2-4 acres per hour). These robots are also able to thin crops to maximize crop health and yields per acre.\n\nIn early 2022, Carbon launched the commercial LaserWeeder and began targeting large vegetable growers in Arizona, California, Idaho, New Mexico, Eastern Oregon and Eastern Washington State. This year, the LaserWeeder will be delivered to farms across 17 U.S. states and three provinces in Canada., with expansion into international markets to follow\n\nCarbon Robotics was founded in 2018 and is headquartered in Seattle, Washington.

      "# [Benefits for farmers — Carbon Robotics](https://carbonrobotics.com/benefits)\nBenefits for farmers\n\nincreaseD crop yield and quality\n\nLasers leave the soil microbiology undisturbed, unlike tillage. The lack of herbicides and soil disruption paves the way for a regenerative approach, which leads to healthy crops and higher yields.\n\nOverall cost reduction\n\nAutomated robots enable farmers to reduce the highly variable cost of manual labor as well as reduce the use of crop inputs such as herbicides and fertilizers. Labor is often farmers’ biggest cost and crop inputs account for 28.2% of their total expenses. Reducing costs in both these areas is a huge benefit.\n\nregenerative farming practices\n\nTraditional chemicals used by farmers, such as herbicides, deteriorate soil health and are tied to health problems in humans and other mammals. A laser-powered, autonomous weed management solution reduces or eliminates farmers’ need for herbicides.\n\neconomical path to organic farming\n\nOne of the largest obstacles to organic farming is cost-effective weed control. A solution to weed management that doesn’t require herbicides or an increase in manual labor provides farmers with a more realistic path to classifying their crops as organic.",

Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.\n\nApplicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.\n\nNotice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: 807 Aurora Avenue North, Seattle, WA 98109. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.\n\nArbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“Arbitration Rules”) governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.\n\nAdditional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.\n\nTime Limits. If you or the Company pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.\n\nAuthority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.\n\nWaiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.\n\nWaiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.\n\nConfidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.\n\nSeverability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.\n\nRight to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.\n\nSurvival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.\n\nSmall Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.\n\nEmergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.\n\nClaims Not Subject to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.\n\nCourts. In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within King County, Washington, for such purpose.\n\nExport. The Site may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not to export, reexport, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from Company, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.\n\nDisclosures. Company is located at the address in Section 8.8. If you are a California resident, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Product of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.\n\nElectronic Communications. The communications between you and Company use electronic means, whether you use the Site or send us emails, or whether Company posts notices on the Site or communicates with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from Company in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Company provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were to be in a hardcopy writing. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights.\n\nEntire Terms. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Site. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation”. If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to Company is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Company’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Company may freely assign these Terms. The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms shall be binding upon assignees.\n\nCopyright/Trademark Information. Copyright © 2021 CARBON ROBOTICS.

      "# [Technology — Carbon Robotics](https://carbonrobotics.com/laserweeding-technology)\nCarbon Robotics™ is pioneering the next revolution in agricultural technology: laserweeding.\n\nWeed control is one of farming’s biggest headaches. By leveraging artificial Intelligence and laser technology, Carbon Robotics delivers chemical-free, no-till, weed control for specialty crops. Our hi-resolutions cameras feed imagery in real time to an onboard supercomputer that runs computer vision models to identify crops and weeds. High-powered lasers then kill weeds at the meristem — without harming valuable crops. Laserweeding works day or night, in all weather conditions. It’s a high-precision solution that improves crop yield and reduces overall costs associated with modern farming. Additionally, laserweeding creates sustainable paths to regenerative and organic farming.",
      "# [Autonomous LaserWeeder Demo Unit — Carbon Robotics](https://carbonrobotics.com/autonomous-weeder)\nCarbon Robotics™ launched its Autonomous LaserWeeder™ in 2021 to provide farmers with an efficient and cost effective weed management solution. Leveraging deep-learning-based computer vision, the Autonomous LaserWeeder identifies, targets and eliminates weeds while driving autonomously over crop rows. Since its founding in 2018, Carbon Robotics has worked closely with farmers to develop this precision laserweeding technology, which supports sustainable and reliable weed elimination for both conventional and organic farmers.\n\nCarbon Robotics’ Autonomous LaserWeeders now serve as demo units, allowing specialty crop growers to see laserweeding’s proven efficiency, precision, and benefits when adopted. For those interested in purchasing a laserweeding robot, take a look at the LaserWeeder, Carbon Robotics’ new commercially available unit, which has 3X the number of lasers for increased weeding capacity and integrates effortlessly into existing farming infrastructure.",

How many magnitudes of more hours will it take to slowly drive that delicate machinery over massive fields compared to just spraying pesticides. When the plants actually start to grow up, how will the lasers find weeds underneath leaves and other growth to shoot them? It works now cause the crop has only just sprouted, but its clearly not suitable for all stages of plant growth, which means you're purchasing a very expensive piece of equipment that you expect you'll only be able to use for like, 5-15% of the time the crops spend growing, and then you're forced to go back to pesticides for the remaining 85% of the time.\n\nIt's a cool tech demo, but it looks like it'd increase weeding costs in terms of time and money spent by a factor of like, 10X.

To be effective, it moves at around 4 miles per hour. Basically walking pace. In order to do a quarter mile section of my farm it would take 20+ hours non stop to complete if nothing goes wrong. And something ALWAYS goes wrong. And a single once over isn't going to prevent anything popping up the next day, so assume you'll need to go over sections a few times at least. In order to cover my entire farm I would need to be dragging this thing around all day, every day for a few months.\n\n\nCost is another major factor.

A sprayer these days can have a boom that’s 120 feet across and run at >25mph. Say this implement covers 30 feet horizontally and moves at 5mph, which may be generous. That’s already 20x slower. To make this work in your cash crops, I think you’ve got to make it autonomous and cheap, so farmers can run a fleet of them over more hours to make up for the speed. Of course, that’s not even mentioning the other issues brought up in this thread, namely around the efficacy of killing the weed.\n\nAll this is to say, it’s an interesting technology and I hope we continue to pursue it. However, right now, it is a bit like vertical farming — exciting and generates buzz, but with limited agricultural use cases, and probably pretty far from useful for the big cash crops which 90% of US farmland is used for.\n\n### Comment ID jqjjkcw with +3 score by [(setocsheir, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqjjkcw/) (in reply to ID jqj0zra):\nI'd say the autonomation part is coming.

We modified an airplane so we could put 12 cameras on the wings, each one taking photographs of fields over 12 different wavelengths.  Then we'd run the images through a program that would perfectly align the pixels in each image and then we would send the pixels through an algorithm.\n\nTwo features were absolutely incredible. \n\n1. We could see water content and use that data to tell irrigation systems where to water and where not to water, which would reduce the amount water a farmer would need to use to irrigate.\n2. We could detect anomalous plants and direct the software in a tractor with a sprayer system how much herbicide to use, which would reduce the overall amount of chemicals the farmer needed to spray.  Same with detecting insects and pesticide spraying.\n\nThe airplane was supposed to be a stepping stone to using satellite imagery fed through the algorithms to feed the data down to the farmer/tractor in real time.  As an alternative they were also testing mounting the cameras to the underside of high clearance tractors for a lower cost alternative.\n\nEDIT:  The science we were using is called hyperspectral imaging, which is the same technique astronomers use to tell what elements stars and planets are made of.\n\n## Comment ID jqjlg3i with +2 score by [(Prof_Cyan, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqjlg3i/) (in reply to ID 14pkhnw):\nHere come the radioactive spiders in the crops, we gonna be a nation of spidermen and spidergwen's\n\n## Comment ID jqjm2h3 with +2 score by [(OGSkip, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqjm2h3/) (in reply to ID 14pkhnw):\n“In new news, we got cancer from the lasers”\n\n## Comment ID jqjm73k with +2 score by [(mrshulgin, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqjm73k/) (in reply to ID 14pkhnw):\nDo you guys want laser-proof plants?

Herbicides, they can prevent new growth of weeds as well, so you don’t have to spray very often, it also sprays over a wide area so it doesn’t take too long to do a field. This is a small device going at a slow speed, like look at the size of the field in the video and imagine how long it would take to do that whole field. This thing would be crazy expensive to operate by comparison since you’d have to pay for fuel and the driver to go out every single week to slowly drive around your fields.

Basically each time you burn off the leaves the energy stores in the roots will get expended growing more leaves and then you have to burn those off.

Or an orchard, a grain below the canopy, potatoes & then mushrooms along the ground.

The closer the beryllium hemispheres came together the more neutrons were reflected and the higher the criticality of the core became. Neutron radiation will pass right through human tissue, and it will be slowed by water but most definitely not reflected back. If that was the case, every nuclear reactor that was kept underwater would be going supercritical. Water is a moderator, but not a reflector. \n\nThe core went supercritical because the screwdriver slipped when Slotin was startled by a clipboard falling to the floor, and the beryllium sphere nearly closed completely.

Quiet and no emissions, which is good, but a long way to go before its competitive.\n\nThe problem is they are trying to do what an ICE tractor does - they use one big motor and then use pulleys, transmissions, and gears, to distribute the power to the wheels, hydraulic pump, and PTO. This means that you can't independently control the PTO and the wheels, or the hydraulic pump and the PTO. For example he tried to use a PTO mower to mow a field, and had to do it slowly in order for the PTO to be spinning the blade fast enough, because there are only certain gear ratios available. Just silly, and shows that they are stuck thinking 'in the box'.\n\nThey really should use a bunch of smaller electric motors - one for the hydraulic pump, one for the PTO, and either one per axle or per wheel.\n\n#### Comment ID k31mtul with +3 score by [(landofcortados, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k31mtul/) (in reply to ID k30ywhj):\nI was interested in one of these, till I found out that they didn't design it with the use of a J1772 plug, which quite frankly is super annoying to have to buy another plug.

Farming machinery is expensive and ideal timing for different operations in the field annoyingly narrow on top of being weather dependent.

Though there definitely are some niche scenarios where diesel-electric is used for sake of straight fuel efficiency.\n\nOn top of that: current tractors during heavy field work already operate their diesel engines close to their peak efficiency. You literally size the tractor and implement together so that the power demands match the capacity to efficiently generate it. They need substantial amounts of torque, but definitely nothing in realms of moving 6000 ton train from standstill.\n\n## Comment ID k319hsa with +3 score by [(MX-Nacho, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k319hsa/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nI'm just seeing a very condensed article with info everybody knows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNonetheless, something that would help tremendously with costs would be EV farm equipment with swappable batteries. Some farm machines (like combines) cost as much as exotic cars, yet they are only used a couple weeks per year. Say that you have a number of EV farm machines for year-round service, then buy an EV combine without batteries and a week before harvest you swap all of their batteries, and possibly even a few motors, into the combine.\n\n### Comment ID k31a66k with +1 score by [(galaxy_groundhog, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k31a66k/) (in reply to ID k319hsa):\nThat’s over my head!

Not because torque anything like that - it's all about energy density of batteries. Unlike cars and to some degree even trucks - tractors and other farming equipment uses pretty close to its max rated power continuously while working. So a moderately sized 100kW tractor will need somewhere north of 1000kWh worth of energy for a full day of heavy work. \n\nThis is just plainly difficult - single battery like that is prohibitively heavy and expensive. Fast chargers and smaller batteries that work perfectly in cars are not an option as there obviously aren't any fast chargers in the middle of a field. Systems for battery replacement and transporting them to recharge somewhere else add notable amount of logistical complexity (though curiously enough aren't necessarily *that* different from fuel deliveries straight to the field already utilized in some circumstances).\n\nIt's basically the same problem that electrification of long haul trucking faces, except 5 times *more* difficult.\n\n#### Comment ID k31ezf8 with +2 score by [(Schemen123, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k31ezf8/) (in reply to ID k31dnc4):\nFarm equipment usually has a reaaaal bad efficiency simply because ice isn't good for the load requirements of hydraulics and or mechanical power the motor does need to provide.\n\nIt definitely will benefit from at least partial electrification for example a serial hyprid approach.\n\n### Comment ID k318ulb with +2 score by [(galaxy_groundhog, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k318ulb/) (in reply to ID k318ocm):\nSolar powered tractor?!

Transporting fuel out to large unpopulated areas can't be cheap and I'm assuming farm equipment probably gets unused 12 hours a day and during the night when electricity demand is the lowest so you'd have to make minimal upgrades to infrastructure since you've got all night to charge a batter (no need for a 50kW charger).

Tractors typically get pulled out and set up for multiple days of consecutive work. The ability to simply refuel from your truck's diesel tank in the bed is a key feature. \n\nNot only that, there are farmers who rely on remote barns for equipment storage. Now that's a problem because the barn that the auxiliary use tractor gets parked in doesn't have a significant enough power source for charging. \n\nIf we're trying to \"clean up agriculture\" the focus needs to be on the environmental impacts of their farming processes, not their farming equipment.\n\n## Comment ID k33q0dz with +2 score by [(bkcarp00, Reddit, 2023-10-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k33q0dz/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nCan't wait for the conservative farmers to realize how much money and maintenance they will save with an EV.

Making 300kWh to 600kWh is somewhat feasible without any major innovation but at say 100kW of constant power while pulling heavy add ons it would last at most 3 to 6 hours of work, not the full day of work and some task might consume closer to 200kW. Idk if harvesters would be in a better position but while those don't need to pull anything, their internals probably consume plenty of energy to sift and sort the materials. At any rate, besides small tractors used for various tasks for short duration or short distance, at this time they are not very feasible and hybrid ones make a lot sense and while in a decade or two it will be different due to increasing energy density and lower costs but that won't be true in the next 5 years, that's pretty much guaranteed a decade or more long term problem.\n\n## Comment ID llny0o0 with +1 score by [(zukoismymain, Reddit, 2024-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/llny0o0/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nThis is the most retarded thing I've seen in my entire life\n\n## Comment ID lppnlyq with +1 score by [(Resident-Donkey-6808, Reddit, 2024-09-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/lppnlyq/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nNope it has been stated that ev tractors are not good for soil due to weight and short battery life.\n\n\nEv tractors do have potential but they are far from ready.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID k320ha8 with +1 score by [(mooktakim, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k320ha8/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nDo you even need battery powered, maybe they could be wired, with long cables\n\n## Comment ID k33chsk with +1 score by [(settlementfires, Reddit, 2023-10-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k33chsk/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nmakes sense... you're operating around a fairly central location so battery charging/swapping is easy to work in.   they're gonna save a shitload of fuel... and money.  \n\nyou could do that agrivoltaic farming, use the solar cells to charge your tractors\n\n## Comment ID k34qto8 with +1 score by [(yes_its_him, Reddit, 2023-10-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k34qto8/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nIt costs about 3X what a typical 50 HP tractor costs, so that's going to be an issue in the short term.

      "# [Carbon Robotic’s laser-wielding robot weeders by Chad Elmore on 2024-05-06](https://www.powerprogress.com/news/carbon-robotic-s-laser-wielding-robot-weeders/8037112.article)\nCarbon Robotics has employed computer vision, artificial intelligence (AI) and lasers to help keep weeds at bay, and its success in the field has convinced specialty crop growers around the world to employ its weed control implement. Last year, the company saw LaserWeeder sales triple compared to 2022.\n\n“Our customers laser weeded for more than 50,000 total hours last year across more than 100 different crops, capturing major savings in weed control costs and reporting substantial increases in crop yield and quality,” said Paul Mikesell, CEO and founder of Carbon Robotics, based in Seattle, Wash.\n\nWhen Mikesell started the company in 2018, his first task was to perfect an AI system that could identify crops and weeds. Several generations later, the system employed by the tractor-pulled implement can see and learn as it travels through the field, ensuring weeds are removed with laser-like precision -- literally.\n\n“That’s part of our specialty today,” said Mikesell. “Our AI computer vision system is identifying weeds on location based on what the camera sees. Then, using optics and control systems, we’re able to target each laser at the weeds. From the bottom of the machine, a laser beam hits the weed that we’ve identified. We use thermal energy from the laser to burn out the meristem, which is the growth center of the plant. It does this at speed. We’ve gotten rid of chemicals all together.”\n\nNo weeds, no chemicals\n\nEach LaserWeeder carries an on-board generator driven by the tractor’s power take-off (PTO) to power 30 individual 150 W lasers, 42 high-resolution cameras and the control system itself. The lasers are reportedly ready to fire every 50 milliseconds, eradicating up to 300,000 weeds across 1 to 3 acres every hour. The company said the LaserWeeder implement can cut weed control costs by 80%.\n\n“There’s a lot of power up in there,” said Mikesell, “and we’re killing these weeds.”\n\nAgricultural equipment engineers have long sought technology that will help application equipment and their operators reduce chemical inputs.\n\n“There are a lot of positive side effects to not spraying,” said Mikesell. “There’s the downstream effects of runoff, of course. But perhaps the biggest thing that we’ve discovered is that growers are getting big yield increases because herbicides tend to knock crops back in their growing cycle. When you don’t have to spray, you get much better yield. Customers are getting better quality crops, with a higher percentage of them coming to harvest. That’s led to increased volume coming out of the fields and, as a result, more income.”\n\nHitch-mounted robot\n\nWhen Carbon Robotics first showed growers what it had been working on, it did so with an autonomous, self-propelled robot. The box-like machine is powered by a Cummins QSF2.8 diesel engine rated 74 hp that drove hydraulic motors at each of the four wheels. While the prototype machine is still used for field demonstrations, the company ultimately went to market in early 2022 with a 20 ft. wide implement that is pulled behind a standard row-crop tractor equipped with a Category 3 three-point hitch.\n\n“There are quite a few regulatory challenges to overcome to make the autonomous robot viable, and a lot of exception cases,” said Mikesell. “You must solve so many exceptions to make it usable – such as irrigation pipes, ditches and rocks – that we did not want that process to get in the way of customers benefiting from using LaserWeeders. Every farm is different, and every farmer does things in a special way. There is a lot involved with getting a machine out of a shed and transporting it to the field, and that involves decisions that people handle every day. We felt it was much better to let them continue to manage those processes with somebody in the cab of the tractor.”\n\nRather than navigate between Point A and B, today’s LaserWeeder employs its cameras and deep learning to completely automate the monotonous job of hand-weeding acres of soon-to-be salad ingredients.\n\n“If a grower has dozens of people pulling weeds, you can replace them with one person driving a tractor. And that’s still a very great cost benefit,” said Mikesell. “One thing we always point out is that we’re not really taking away jobs. Farmers are struggling to find people to do this work. We’re using technology to allow farmers to grow at scale without struggling to keep up with the labor demand.”\n\nPlus, most of the farmers who want to know what a LaserWeeder will mean to their individual operations already have a fleet of tractors to pull the machine.\n\nLatest updates revealed\n\nDuring February’s World Ag Expo in Tulare, Calif., Carbon Robotics showed several updates on the LaserWeeder, including a tracked model and software enhancements.\n\nThe new Track LaserWeeder uses two systems built in collaboration with Canada-based track specialist Soucy International and GK Machine, an agricultural equipment OEM and contract manufacturer in Oregon. The application of tracks rather than wheels is expected to extend the implement’s usability across a wide range of soil types, including muck soil, and minimize compaction from the 12,600 lb. machine. The company said it already has orders for the tracked weeder and the first units have been delivered to growers.\n\n“Custom tracks extend the versatility and flexibility of the LaserWeeder and open up laser weeding to more regions and farms with varying soil types,” said John Mey, vice president of product, Carbon Robotics. “By improving ground pressure to 6.5 psi and supporting row spacing of 64 to 90 in., growers in muck regions now can use LaserWeeder to do the work of a 75-person hand weeding crew, have an alternative to herbicides, and gain the production benefits resulting from no soil disruption.”\n\nAt the show, the company also introduced visualized spatial data to its customers, which it said will permit growers to access field, crop and weed metrics within its Carbon Ops Center, including stand count, density, type, average plant size and distribution.\n\n“We’ve been working internally on the Carbon Ops Center for quite some time,” said Mikesell, “and this update allows growers to do crop and weed analytics, allowing them to see what’s happening in their fields over time. Growers can use the system to figure out where weeds are coming from: they can see it on the map and watch weeds show up and spread into the field. With that view, they can see they’re getting purslane from an irrigation ditch, for example. We break it down by weed type so you can actually tell the species of the plant, which is very, very helpful.”\n\nThe technology is good for more than recording the weed population, said Mikesell. “Growers can also use it to see how much of the crop is coming through and how big and healthy they are. We’re going to keep adding to that functionality, too. We will have several other software updates this year to let farmers get a lot more information about what’s happening in the field. We can do that because these machines are in fields learning right now.”\n\nThe company also announced that the iPad-based application that runs the implement is now translated into eight languages, including Spanish and English. “Because we’re in Europe a lot now, we have French, German, Danish, Polish, Romanian and Dutch translations,” said Mikesell. “And although Australia doesn’t need a language translation, we’ve also been selling a lot of units there.”\n\nCarrots and bok choy\n\nThe LaserWeeder is currently programmed to work in 100 different crops, of which the most common these days are onions, carrots and lettuce – all crops that go from field to grocery store in the span of a few days.\n\n“We do everything from radishes to bok choy to broccoli and cauliflower,” said Mikesell, “and we can pick up a new crop type in 24 hours. When we get to a new field, we take pictures, train the AI, and we’re ready to go the next day. The machine just keeps learning from that and will get better and better.”\n\nAs a technology company, Carbon Robotics works with several contract manufacturers to produce the robotic weed eradicator. Final assembly happens in suburban Detroit.\n\nTo support continued growth and new product development, Carbon Robotics said it raised $43 million in new capital in 2023, bringing its total funding to $80 million since it was founded.",

At its core, the historical widespread usage of herbicides has been a double-edged sword – having been key to achieving optimum crop yields, but with each application there remains a percentage of naturally resistant weeds that continually reappear and reproduce. This cycle results in more resistant weeds with each passing season, resulting in what are coined “superweeds”.\n\nAs regenerative farming and sustainable means of food production continue to gain traction with growers, consumers, and investors alike, non-invasive and non-chemical means of weed control are becoming ever-more in demand.\n\nThe LaserWeeder leverages 24 NVIDIA graphic processing units (GPUs), processing 4.7 million high-resolution images per hour for unrivaled AI-driven plant detection and identification to target and eliminate weeds using lasers.\n\nThe technology can eradicate 5,000 weeds per minute with sub-millimeter precision and utilizes the world’s most diverse and fastest growing agricultural image dataset comprising 25 million labeled plants and more than 30,000 crop and weed models.\n\nIt also has the ability to capture real-time metrics on crops and weeds, sending them to the cloud and providing farmers with actionable, visual insights into their field farming operations at any time from any place.\n\n“With this investment, and using the power of AI, we can help farmers create farms and food systems of the future that are more productive, efficient, healthy, and profitable,” said Paul Mikesell, CEO and founder, Carbon Robotics.\n\nThis investment not only supports the advancement of a critical sustainability tool for farmers, but underscores the power of AI in transforming global agriculture and Carbon Robotics’ innovative role in the industry.\n\nThe concept of the LaserWeeder has been proven by top farmers to reduce weed control costs by 80 percent while also significantly increasing crop yield and quality.

      "# [Could AI robots with lasers make herbicides — and farm workers — obsolete? by Hayley Smith, Hayley Smith Staff, www.latimes.com, hayley-smith on 2024-07-22](https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-07-22/are-robots-the-answer-to-harmful-agricultural-herbicides)\nThe smell of burnt vegetation wafted through a lettuce field here one recent summer morning as nearly 200 farmers, academics and engineers gathered to witness the future of automated agriculture.\n\nThirteen hulking machines with names like “Weed Spider” and “Mantis” crawled through rows of romaine. One used artificial intelligence cameras to scan the crops and spray them with herbicides. Another zapped weeds with lasers. Yet another deployed robotic arms to cultivate and pick through the foliage.\n\n“It’s a hurdle for people to get over, but the reality is, the numbers don’t lie,” said Tim Mahoney, a field representative for Carbon Robotics, a Seattle-based company that created one of the machines on display — a 9,500-pound apparatus known as the LaserWeeder.\n\nThe massive machine uses deep-learning AI models to scan fields and identify weeds in real time before vaporizing them with more than 30 high-powered lasers, all while protecting the crop. The company says it reduces farming costs, increases yields and improves soil health while avoiding the need for chemical herbicides.\n\n“This is the future,” Mahoney said as the LaserWeeder moved through the lettuce, leaving small wisps of smoke in its wake.\n\nThe high-tech field day comes at a moment when Californians are strongly reconsidering their relationship with traditional herbicides and pesticides. Chemicals such as paraquat, dacthal and glyphosate — also known as RoundUp — have for decades been used to eliminate weeds and pests from the state’s crops, but are increasingly associated with cancer, Parkinson’s disease, kidney disease, respiratory ailments and birth defects, among other potential health risks.\n\nSteven Fennimore, a weed researcher and professor of plant sciences at UC Davis, said the industry’s technological shift arrives as state regulators are “weeding out the old stuff.” Assembly Bill 1963 — a bill seeking to ban the use of paraquat in California — is working its way through the state Legislature and will be heard by the Senate Appropriations committee in August.\n\nWhat’s more, the California Department of Pesticide Regulation last year released a roadmap for sustainable pest management that aims to transition the state away from harmful chemicals and toward safer, organic alternatives by 2050.\n\nFennimore, who organized the field day in Salinas, said many of the state’s most popular herbicides and pesticides have been around for more than half a century and come with considerable baggage despite their effectiveness. Dacthal was first registered for use in the United States in 1958, paraquat in 1964 and glyphosate in 1974.\n\nMachines enhanced with AI and robotics can help solve many of the same problems without the use of antique sprays and pollutants, he said.\n\n“We’re not getting a lot of new pesticides because the path to commercialization is a whole lot different than it was in 1958 — it’s much more expensive, the toxicology has to be pristine, you can’t injure wildlife in any way,” Fennimore said. “So the machine vision products that are weeding are very much welcome, very much needed.”\n\nMahoney, of Carbon Robotics, said the company is selling about one $1.4-million LaserWeeder per week, with more than 80 on the market worldwide already. Some customers run it 24 hours a day, including one grower who has it programmed for more than 40 individual crops, he said.\n\nHe added that the weeder can zap thousands of weeds per minute, compared with the roughly 40 weeds per minute that can be picked by hand.\n\n“It’s kind of like a Swiss Army knife,” Mahoney said.\n\nA shift from herbicides and manual labor to intelligent robots would have far-reaching consequences for California’s $50-billion agriculture industry and local economies.\n\nThe potential loss of hand crews is raising concerns. In Monterey County, where Salinas is located, agriculture accounts for nearly a quarter of all jobs and represents the largest employment sector by far, ahead of both government and tourism, according to county data.\n\nSome experts fear the new technology could eliminate farm positions without offering suitable replacements.\n\n“It’s going to be a whole mixed bag of complications,” said Barbara Meister, a consultant with the Salinas Inclusive Economic Development Initiative, who also attended the field day.\n\n“This weeder is an example of replacing human labor with mechanical labor,” Meister said as she pointed to one of the machines. “So for us, we’re thinking about, does this technology enhance labor, replace labor, or create new job opportunities?”\n\nChris Benner, director of the Institute for Social Transformation at UC Santa Cruz, likened the new tools to the mechanical tomato harvester, which displaced some 30,000 farm jobs when it was first introduced in the 1950s, but also ushered in a new era of industrialized food production.\n\n“We need more efficiencies in agriculture to improve profit margins and be able to pay workers in the field more, but that’s ultimately going to displace some people,” Benner said. “What do we do, in that context, to support people who need new training into other types of jobs? The social challenges are much harder than the technical training challenges.”\n\nBut agriculture is also facing a shortage of labor. Multiple farmers at the field day said they’re having a tough time finding workers to pick weeds and crops — a tedious and challenging job that often offers only short seasons and minimum wage. The work can also be dangerous, especially when it involves applying potentially toxic chemicals to plants, or toiling in extreme heat.\n\nPete Anecito, a director of farming with Sábor Farms, said his team is already running a LaserWeeder around the clock, which is being used on spinach mixes and other high-density plantings. It performs the work of roughly two human crews in a 24-hour period, he said.\n\n“All of them lend themselves to different applications that are going to save us time and money,” Anecito said as he checked out the new machines. “These are great trials out here. We need to see what it does to the operation.”\n\nWhile experts continue to weigh the labor implications, the environmental benefits of the technology are much clearer, according to Fennimore.\n\n“We’re not using herbicides, not using pesticides, not using fumigants,” he said. He noted that one machine his team is working on — a smart steamer that sterilizes soil — can be used near schools, where people don’t want “nasty chemical stuff.”\n\nIn fact, a coalition of environmental groups, social justice organizations and teachers sued Monterey County agriculture officials and state pesticide regulators in April, alleging the use of restricted pesticides in close proximity to three elementary schools.\n\n“This stuff does serious damage, sometimes permanent damage, and the worst part is it can take decades — if ever — for our regulators to act on this, and that’s the pattern we have to disrupt,” said Mark Weller, a campaign director with Californians for Pesticide Reform, one of the groups involved in the suit.\n\nThe use of such chemicals can amount to a form of environmental racism, he said, because the people most likely to be exposed to and sickened by herbicides and pesticides are often low-income people, Latinos, migrant farm workers and other vulnerable populations.\n\nWeller noted that there are more than 130 pesticides used in California that are not approved in the European Union, including paraquat, which is banned in about 60 countries. However, the group’s call for pesticide reform is not focused on artificial intelligence, but rather organic agriculture and integrated weed management strategies, many of which are outlined in the state’s 2050 roadmap.\n\nAmong the strategies Weller recommended are inter-row hoeing, which helps suppress weeds; thermal weeding, which uses heat to kill weeds; and bio-herbicides, which use microorganisms for weed control.\n\nThere is also growing interest in replacing herbicides and pesticides at the molecular level. One recent study published in the journal Nature highlighted the ways in which nanotechnology typically used in the medical field could be used to deliver pesticides, herbicides and fungicides to specific biological targets in plants where infections and other issues can occur.\n\n“There’s a whole field of integrated weed management that existed before pesticides, and exists all across the world,” Weller said. “So it’s increasingly frustrating to hear ‘Big Ag’ and the regulators saying there’s no substitute.”\n\nIndeed, many agricultural companies are resistant to change since their products are still effective and profitable, Fennimore said. Syngenta, a leading manufacturer of paraquat, raked in a reported $32 billion in sales in 2023, according to its annual report.\n\nThe industry is also filled with deep pockets and powerful lobbyists, which can make it difficult to bring about significant change. But while the companies that created the original products may feel threatened by new AI innovations, “it really doesn’t matter what they think,” Fennimore said.\n\n“The ag-chem companies — they understand that they’re really not parties to this development,” he said. “And they they see the old chemistry under fire and it causes them lots of worry.”\n\nStill, AI farming technology has a ways to go, according to Brad Hanson, an herbicide researcher with the UC Davis Department of Plant Sciences.\n\nRobots and lasers that work on 30,000 acres of lettuce or broccoli may not yet be applicable or economical for millions of acres of soybeans, he said. However, their appeal is growing.\n\n“There’s interest and there’s opportunity,” he said. “[With] high labor costs, environmental and toxicity issues with poured herbicides, regulatory challenges more broadly in California, this kind of thing is becoming important — and will become even more important.”\n\nAt the field day in Salinas, it was clear that innovation is marching steadily forward.\n\nIn one row, growers used a joystick to operate a Lego-like, $25,000 modular robot on wheels that can be coded for use as a cultivator, a seeder, a data collector, or whatever else is needed on the field, according to its creator, a group called Farm-NG.\n\nNearby, a metal behemoth from the company Laudando & Associates looked like a Tesla Cybertruck as it combed through a field deploying lasers for weeding and thinning. Next to it, a smart cultivator from Stout Industrial displayed its use of AI vision and mechanical blades to remove weeds from around the crops.\n\nFollowing each display, a crowd of growers and researchers squatted in the rows to examine the machine’s work, murmuring among themselves about charred leaves or disrupted dirt. Representatives from each company touted their product’s benefits over a megaphone.\n\nA spokesman from Greentech Robotics, which created the WeedSpider, said the 2,000-pound machine was using LIDAR sensors to create a 3-D elevation profile of the field in real time, which could be used for mechanical weeding, thinning or precision spraying. The device can service up to 28 acres a day, he said.\n\nAnd, like most AI tools, it is constantly learning as it goes.\n\n“Every machine out in the field is always improving,” he said, as the robot’s mechanical arms sifted through the soil behind him.",

      "# [Agtech Seedlings: Nvidia invests in weed-killing robots | Startup lands $26M for cattle methane vaccine by Nathan Owens, Agriculture Dive staff on 2024-05-10](https://www.agriculturedive.com/news/agtech-seedlings-nvidia-invests-in-weed-killing-robots-syngenta-biotech/715805/)\nThis audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.\n\nNvidia invests in laser-shooting weed killer\n\nSeattle-based Carbon Robotics has received an investment from NVentures, the venture capital arm of gaming and computer graphics giant Nvidia, to scale production of a weed-killing device powered by artificial intelligence.\n\nThe startup has raised more than $80 million for its LaserWeeder robot since its founding in 2018. The robot, which weighs 10,000 pounds, uses imaging technology to target and eliminate weeds with lasers. Customers include Braga Fresh, which has used the robot to improve efficiency and bring down cost at produce farms. Details about Nvidia’s financial support were not disclosed.\n\n“With this investment, and using the power of AI, we can help farmers create farms and food systems of the future that are more productive, efficient, healthy and profitable,” Paul Mikesell, CEO and founder of Carbon Robotics said in a statement.\n\n— Nathan Owens\n\nStartup nabs $26.5M for methane-reducing livestock vaccine\n\nAgtech startup ArkeaBio raised $26.5 million to develop a \"methane vaccine\" with the goal of reducing global livestock emissions.\n\nArkeaBio's vaccine aims to tackle enteric methane emissions, or the methane associated with cow burps. These emissions, which occur as a natural byproduct of the digestive process, are estimated to make up around one-third of the world's methane output.\n\nThe vaccine is a cost-effective solution to tackle these emissions at scale, the startup said. It activates a cow's immune response, creating antibodies that neutralize methane-producing bacteria.\n\nThe fundraising round was led by current investor Breakthrough Energy Ventures, with investments from Rabo Ventures and the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment. The investment will help the company expand research and development of the vaccine, including large-scale field trials.\n\n“Reducing methane emissions from the agricultural sector is one of the most pressing challenges in today’s fight against climate change,” said Chris Rivest, chairman of the board at ArkeaBio and partner at Breakthrough Energy Ventures. “ArkeaBio’s approach using innovative vaccine technologies will create effective and massively scalable solutions.\"\n\n— Sarah Zimmerman\n\nUSDA, EPA and FDA to overhaul biotechnology regulation\n\nThe Agriculture Department has developed a plan with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration to revamp their regulations and oversight processes for biotechnology products.\n\nThe effort is in response to an executive order from the Biden administration that aims to accelerate biotech innovation in agriculture and other sectors by streamlining the regulatory process.\n\nAs part of the plan, the EPA, FDA and USDA have identified five target areas of focus and intend to implement a number of efforts to make the registration process simpler for developers of genetically engineered plants, animals and microorganisms.\n\nThey also plan to conduct a pilot project to determine the feasibility and costs of creating a web-based tool that developers can use to see which agency may regulate a given product category.\n\nA coordinated governmental framework for biotechnology regulation was created in 1986, and was most recently updated in 2017.\n\n— Nathan Owens\n\nSyngenta fungicide on track to hit $1B milestone as more countries gain access\n\nThe crop protection giant has expanded market access of its patented Adepidyn technology to more than 55 countries, fueling unprecedented sales growth for the fungicide.\n\nFollowing the brand’s recent registration in Great Britain, Syngenta Group is on track to generate $1 billion in annual sales from products containing Adepidyn, which the company said marks the first time its active ingredient has achieved this milestone in only eight years.\n\n“ADEPIDYN technology is a game-changer for modern agriculture and enables farmers to grow crops more sustainably,” Ioana Tudor, global head of marketing at Syngenta Crop Protection, said in a statement. “It represents a significant milestone in our efforts to secure high yields and low impact to the planet and is exciting because of its high levels of consistency and effectiveness.”\n\nAround the world, farmers lose an estimated 10% - 23% of their crops to fungal diseases each year, according to Syngenta. Adepidyn fungicides are used on dozens of crops to tackle diseases like fusarium head blight in wheat and net blotch in barley.",

Carbon Robotics by CNBC.com staff, www.facebook.com on 2024-05-14](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/14/carbon-robotics-cnbc-disruptor-50.html)\nAgriculture is one of the most important sectors in the history of the world, and as one of the oldest, it's also proven to be one of the hardest to disrupt in recent years. But AI as part of agtech is aiming at the farm, backed by both VC investors and existing machinery giants like Deere.\n\nCarbon Robotics is a pioneer in AI-powered agricultural robotics designed to help farmers cut costs, boost production and improve crop yield. It's best known for the LaserWeeder – which made a recent appearance on \"NBC Nightly News\" – which combines AI deep learning, computer vision, robotics and lasers to eliminate weeds down to a millimeter level of accuracy.\n\nIn a sign of how the ties between the deepest players in the field of artificial intelligence and other sectors of the economy are growing, Nvidia just announced a venture investment in Carbon Robotics in May.\n\nThe company says that it can save farmers up to 80% on weeding costs, a threat to the herbicide-agricultural complex of the past century synonymous with chemicals companies like Monsanto, Syngenta, and BASF. They are under increasing scrutiny for an approach to farming that has damaged the topsoil, left consumers with concerns about the chemicals in food, while using manufacturing processes that add to the industry's carbon footprint.\n\nThe LaserWeeder has killed over four billion weeds to date and the company estimates it can do the work of 75 farm workers. Last year, the company says customers laser weeded for more than 50,000 total hours across more than 100 different crops.\n\nIf successful at scale, the LaserWeeder will play a role in the food that reaches the everyday consumer – Carbon Robotics is targeting commercial farms with 500-plus planted acres that are selling produce to supermarkets, farms that are looking to cut costs and improve yields, and automate one of the worst jobs in the fields.\n\nIn an interview last year, CEO and founder Paul Mikesell explained how it works at a granular level: \"We're able to explode weed cell walls with a laser beam, right in the growth center of the weed, and that laser beam has no residue deposited; the organic weed matter will then turn into nutrients for the rest of the crops,\" he told produce industry publisher AndNowUKnow.\n\nIn 2023, Carbon Robotics opened two new facilities: Carbon Robotics North and its Richland, Washington-based laser refurbishing and manufacturing facility, allowing the company to increase production rates — it says demand tripled year over year in 2023. It also just rolled out its latest tech in February, the Track LaserWeeder, a new model that extends its capabilities by operating on diverse soil types, including muck soil – a moist, organic, black soil good for root vegetables like carrots and onions and used in specialty crop production.\n\nThe company is also beginning to expand internationally, with the first 10 LaserWeeders for the Europe ag market shipped last year, and several already operational in Australia. Carbon Robotics has also added seven European languages to the LaserWeeder's iPad operator app.\n\nAgtech is one disruptive space where the need is clear and the logic is compelling, but the market has been difficult to budge – as evidenced by challenges faced in recent years by heavily funded former Disruptor Indigo Ag. Many breakthrough ideas remain in the very early days, such as 2023 Disruptor Monarch Tractor, as well as direct competitors FarmWise, Stout Industrial Technology and K.U.L.T.\n\nThe old guard is moving on the opportunity as well, with Deere acquiring several robotics companies including Bear Flag Robotics and Blue River Technology, and pushing forward with an aggressive plan to automate the farm by 2030.\n\nTo continue its growth, Carbon Robotics raised $43 million in new capital in 2023, just over half of the $80 million it has raised since its founding.\n\nSign up for our weekly, original newsletter that goes beyond the annual Disruptor 50 list, offering a closer look at list-making companies and their innovative founders."
