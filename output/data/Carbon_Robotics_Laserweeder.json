The lack of herbicides and soil disruption paves the way for a regenerative approach, which leads to healthy crops and higher yields.\n\nOverall cost reduction\n\nAutomated robots enable farmers to reduce the highly variable cost of manual labor as well as reduce the use of crop inputs such as herbicides and fertilizers. Labor is often farmers’ biggest cost and crop inputs account for 28.2% of their total expenses. Reducing costs in both these areas is a huge benefit.\n\nregenerative farming practices\n\nTraditional chemicals used by farmers, such as herbicides, deteriorate soil health and are tied to health problems in humans and other mammals. A laser-powered, autonomous weed management solution reduces or eliminates farmers’ need for herbicides.\n\neconomical path to organic farming\n\nOne of the largest obstacles to organic farming is cost-effective weed control. A solution to weed management that doesn’t require herbicides or an increase in manual labor provides farmers with a more realistic path to classifying their crops as organic.",

How many magnitudes of more hours will it take to slowly drive that delicate machinery over massive fields compared to just spraying pesticides. When the plants actually start to grow up, how will the lasers find weeds underneath leaves and other growth to shoot them? It works now cause the crop has only just sprouted, but its clearly not suitable for all stages of plant growth, which means you're purchasing a very expensive piece of equipment that you expect you'll only be able to use for like, 5-15% of the time the crops spend growing, and then you're forced to go back to pesticides for the remaining 85% of the time.\n\nIt's a cool tech demo, but it looks like it'd increase weeding costs in terms of time and money spent by a factor of like, 10X.

Kinda like have my Roomba running each day keeps the floors from ever getting super dirty because it’s catching a little bit each day.

There’s models that have fertilizer, herbicide, and pesticide on board and can be super targeted with the chemicals, reducing the use by something like 96% while getting similar results. The vision system also catalogs every single crop and monitors it’s growth and health to come up with customized nutrient regimen for every individual seedling. This tech is going to be so wild in the future.\n\n#### Comment ID jqio3yq with +2 score by [(buddmatth, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqio3yq/) (in reply to ID jqikzfp):\nAwesome!

To be effective, it moves at around 4 miles per hour. Basically walking pace. In order to do a quarter mile section of my farm it would take 20+ hours non stop to complete if nothing goes wrong. And something ALWAYS goes wrong. And a single once over isn't going to prevent anything popping up the next day, so assume you'll need to go over sections a few times at least. In order to cover my entire farm I would need to be dragging this thing around all day, every day for a few months.\n\n\nCost is another major factor.

A sprayer these days can have a boom that’s 120 feet across and run at >25mph. Say this implement covers 30 feet horizontally and moves at 5mph, which may be generous. That’s already 20x slower. To make this work in your cash crops, I think you’ve got to make it autonomous and cheap, so farmers can run a fleet of them over more hours to make up for the speed. Of course, that’s not even mentioning the other issues brought up in this thread, namely around the efficacy of killing the weed.\n\nAll this is to say, it’s an interesting technology and I hope we continue to pursue it. However, right now, it is a bit like vertical farming — exciting and generates buzz, but with limited agricultural use cases, and probably pretty far from useful for the big cash crops which 90% of US farmland is used for.\n\n### Comment ID jqjjkcw with +3 score by [(setocsheir, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqjjkcw/) (in reply to ID jqj0zra):\nI'd say the autonomation part is coming. There are already autonomous tractors developed in the field by multiple companies and I know Deere has a technology developed similar to this that targets specific weeds using image recognition ML.

We modified an airplane so we could put 12 cameras on the wings, each one taking photographs of fields over 12 different wavelengths.  Then we'd run the images through a program that would perfectly align the pixels in each image and then we would send the pixels through an algorithm.\n\nTwo features were absolutely incredible. \n\n1. We could see water content and use that data to tell irrigation systems where to water and where not to water, which would reduce the amount water a farmer would need to use to irrigate.\n2. We could detect anomalous plants and direct the software in a tractor with a sprayer system how much herbicide to use, which would reduce the overall amount of chemicals the farmer needed to spray.  Same with detecting insects and pesticide spraying.\n\nThe airplane was supposed to be a stepping stone to using satellite imagery fed through the algorithms to feed the data down to the farmer/tractor in real time.  As an alternative they were also testing mounting the cameras to the underside of high clearance tractors for a lower cost alternative.\n\nEDIT:  The science we were using is called hyperspectral imaging, which is the same technique astronomers use to tell what elements stars and planets are made of.\n\n## Comment ID jqjlg3i with +2 score by [(Prof_Cyan, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqjlg3i/) (in reply to ID 14pkhnw):\nHere come the radioactive spiders in the crops, we gonna be a nation of spidermen and spidergwen's\n\n## Comment ID jqjm2h3 with +2 score by [(OGSkip, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqjm2h3/) (in reply to ID 14pkhnw):\n“In new news, we got cancer from the lasers”\n\n## Comment ID jqjm73k with +2 score by [(mrshulgin, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqjm73k/) (in reply to ID 14pkhnw):\nDo you guys want laser-proof plants?

Herbicides, they can prevent new growth of weeds as well, so you don’t have to spray very often, it also sprays over a wide area so it doesn’t take too long to do a field. This is a small device going at a slow speed, like look at the size of the field in the video and imagine how long it would take to do that whole field. This thing would be crazy expensive to operate by comparison since you’d have to pay for fuel and the driver to go out every single week to slowly drive around your fields.

Basically each time you burn off the leaves the energy stores in the roots will get expended growing more leaves and then you have to burn those off.

This is the kind of technology we need. Granted, we also need to stop doing genetically engineered monocultures in gigantic fields - we should be building hydro- and aeroponic growing towers that are sealed against outside incursion so weed and pest control would basically not be required - but if we're going to keep doing that, using an approach like this instead of gigatons of damned glyphosate is so much nicer. \n\nComputers and precision servos and stuff aren't cheap but screw cheap, give us usable. \n\nComputers can do so much that's so far beyond a human - and of course the same is true in reverse. But there was even that laser setup that shot down mosquitos in mid-air when they entered a specific range around a tent, for instance - and it could even analyze the frequency of the mosquito's wings to make sure it only shot down female ones, the ones that actually do the blood sucking. This kind of high tech just rocks.\n\nOur species could do so much more, so much better, if we weren't shackled by \"who's going to pay for it?\" horseshit.\n\n## Comment ID jqjuiwx with +1 score by [(Dura_Max, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqjuiwx/) (in reply to ID 14pkhnw):\nI am confused as to how eliminating weeds reduces the need for pesticides.

But that scale comes at a huge cost, a robotic arm that could just pluck what was needed/ripe would allow much greater planting density, more harvests per year, less pesticides & less water.\n\nThink of something like 3 sisters. Or an orchard, a grain below the canopy, potatoes & then mushrooms along the ground. You'd be most limited by sunlight, but even that can be supplemented if you have a green energy source nearby.\n\nBy making plots more productive with a much lower barrier of entry you could also justify moving some production closer to population centers.\n\n## Comment ID jqixtvl with +1 score by [(wildjokers, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqixtvl/) (in reply to ID 14pkhnw):\nHow does it know which ones are the weeds?

Quiet and no emissions, which is good, but a long way to go before its competitive.\n\nThe problem is they are trying to do what an ICE tractor does - they use one big motor and then use pulleys, transmissions, and gears, to distribute the power to the wheels, hydraulic pump, and PTO. This means that you can't independently control the PTO and the wheels, or the hydraulic pump and the PTO. For example he tried to use a PTO mower to mow a field, and had to do it slowly in order for the PTO to be spinning the blade fast enough, because there are only certain gear ratios available. Just silly, and shows that they are stuck thinking 'in the box'.\n\nThey really should use a bunch of smaller electric motors - one for the hydraulic pump, one for the PTO, and either one per axle or per wheel.\n\n#### Comment ID k31mtul with +3 score by [(landofcortados, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k31mtul/) (in reply to ID k30ywhj):\nI was interested in one of these, till I found out that they didn't design it with the use of a J1772 plug, which quite frankly is super annoying to have to buy another plug.

Farming machinery is expensive and ideal timing for different operations in the field annoyingly narrow on top of being weather dependent. Running the tractor round the clock with changing drivers and fuel delivered straight to the field does make sense in quite a few scenarios.\n\nSmaller farms rarely do 24 hours operations, but running a tractor for 16 hours day-in and day-out during most intense periods is very common.\n\nAlso remember that farming equipment lights aren't limited to any silly standard that requires others to see.

Tiny \"yard\" tractors and such that tend to be used for short periods of time, mostly around the farm or close to it.\n\nThe problem that everybody continues to scratch their heads about is how to fit enough batteries in a \"proper\" tractor to allow it to work for whole day without literally doubling its weight. And that's before even talking about price. So far it doesn't really look like anybody has a good idea how to tackle this.\n\n#### Comment ID k31jokp with +3 score by [(mhornberger, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k31jokp/) (in reply to ID k31i9rj):\nFrom what I can tell, for now, the progress is in using a higher number of smaller machines.

Main point to be aware of is that diesel-electric propulsion is *mainly* about reliability and simplicity of generating straight up silly amounts of torque. In terms of efficiency it rarely moves the needle - and when it does, it's often in the opposite direction from what you'd want. Though there definitely are some niche scenarios where diesel-electric is used for sake of straight fuel efficiency.\n\nOn top of that: current tractors during heavy field work already operate their diesel engines close to their peak efficiency. You literally size the tractor and implement together so that the power demands match the capacity to efficiently generate it. They need substantial amounts of torque, but definitely nothing in realms of moving 6000 ton train from standstill.\n\n## Comment ID k319hsa with +3 score by [(MX-Nacho, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k319hsa/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nI'm just seeing a very condensed article with info everybody knows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNonetheless, something that would help tremendously with costs would be EV farm equipment with swappable batteries.

Not because torque anything like that - it's all about energy density of batteries. Unlike cars and to some degree even trucks - tractors and other farming equipment uses pretty close to its max rated power continuously while working. So a moderately sized 100kW tractor will need somewhere north of 1000kWh worth of energy for a full day of heavy work. \n\nThis is just plainly difficult - single battery like that is prohibitively heavy and expensive. Fast chargers and smaller batteries that work perfectly in cars are not an option as there obviously aren't any fast chargers in the middle of a field. Systems for battery replacement and transporting them to recharge somewhere else add notable amount of logistical complexity (though curiously enough aren't necessarily *that* different from fuel deliveries straight to the field already utilized in some circumstances).\n\nIt's basically the same problem that electrification of long haul trucking faces, except 5 times *more* difficult.\n\n#### Comment ID k31ezf8 with +2 score by [(Schemen123, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k31ezf8/) (in reply to ID k31dnc4):\nFarm equipment usually has a reaaaal bad efficiency simply because ice isn't good for the load requirements of hydraulics and or mechanical power the motor does need to provide.\n\nIt definitely will benefit from at least partial electrification for example a serial hyprid approach.\n\n### Comment ID k318ulb with +2 score by [(galaxy_groundhog, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k318ulb/) (in reply to ID k318ocm):\nSolar powered tractor?!

Transporting fuel out to large unpopulated areas can't be cheap and I'm assuming farm equipment probably gets unused 12 hours a day and during the night when electricity demand is the lowest so you'd have to make minimal upgrades to infrastructure since you've got all night to charge a batter (no need for a 50kW charger).

Making 300kWh to 600kWh is somewhat feasible without any major innovation but at say 100kW of constant power while pulling heavy add ons it would last at most 3 to 6 hours of work, not the full day of work and some task might consume closer to 200kW. Idk if harvesters would be in a better position but while those don't need to pull anything, their internals probably consume plenty of energy to sift and sort the materials. At any rate, besides small tractors used for various tasks for short duration or short distance, at this time they are not very feasible and hybrid ones make a lot sense and while in a decade or two it will be different due to increasing energy density and lower costs but that won't be true in the next 5 years, that's pretty much guaranteed a decade or more long term problem.\n\n## Comment ID llny0o0 with +1 score by [(zukoismymain, Reddit, 2024-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/llny0o0/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nThis is the most retarded thing I've seen in my entire life\n\n## Comment ID lppnlyq with +1 score by [(Resident-Donkey-6808, Reddit, 2024-09-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/lppnlyq/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nNope it has been stated that ev tractors are not good for soil due to weight and short battery life.\n\n\nEv tractors do have potential but they are far from ready.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID k320ha8 with +1 score by [(mooktakim, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k320ha8/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nDo you even need battery powered, maybe they could be wired, with long cables\n\n## Comment ID k33chsk with +1 score by [(settlementfires, Reddit, 2023-10-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k33chsk/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nmakes sense... you're operating around a fairly central location so battery charging/swapping is easy to work in.   they're gonna save a shitload of fuel... and money.  \n\nyou could do that agrivoltaic farming, use the solar cells to charge your tractors\n\n## Comment ID k34qto8 with +1 score by [(yes_its_him, Reddit, 2023-10-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k34qto8/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nIt costs about 3X what a typical 50 HP tractor costs, so that's going to be an issue in the short term.

      "# [24. Carbon Robotics by CNBC.com staff, www.facebook.com on 2024-05-14](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/14/carbon-robotics-cnbc-disruptor-50.html)\nAgriculture is one of the most important sectors in the history of the world, and as one of the oldest, it's also proven to be one of the hardest to disrupt in recent years. But AI as part of agtech is aiming at the farm, backed by both VC investors and existing machinery giants like Deere.\n\nCarbon Robotics is a pioneer in AI-powered agricultural robotics designed to help farmers cut costs, boost production and improve crop yield. It's best known for the LaserWeeder – which made a recent appearance on \"NBC Nightly News\" – which combines AI deep learning, computer vision, robotics and lasers to eliminate weeds down to a millimeter level of accuracy.\n\nIn a sign of how the ties between the deepest players in the field of artificial intelligence and other sectors of the economy are growing, Nvidia just announced a venture investment in Carbon Robotics in May.\n\nThe company says that it can save farmers up to 80% on weeding costs, a threat to the herbicide-agricultural complex of the past century synonymous with chemicals companies like Monsanto, Syngenta, and BASF. They are under increasing scrutiny for an approach to farming that has damaged the topsoil, left consumers with concerns about the chemicals in food, while using manufacturing processes that add to the industry's carbon footprint.\n\nThe LaserWeeder has killed over four billion weeds to date and the company estimates it can do the work of 75 farm workers. Last year, the company says customers laser weeded for more than 50,000 total hours across more than 100 different crops.\n\nIf successful at scale, the LaserWeeder will play a role in the food that reaches the everyday consumer – Carbon Robotics is targeting commercial farms with 500-plus planted acres that are selling produce to supermarkets, farms that are looking to cut costs and improve yields, and automate one of the worst jobs in the fields.\n\nIn an interview last year, CEO and founder Paul Mikesell explained how it works at a granular level: \"We're able to explode weed cell walls with a laser beam, right in the growth center of the weed, and that laser beam has no residue deposited; the organic weed matter will then turn into nutrients for the rest of the crops,\" he told produce industry publisher AndNowUKnow.\n\nIn 2023, Carbon Robotics opened two new facilities: Carbon Robotics North and its Richland, Washington-based laser refurbishing and manufacturing facility, allowing the company to increase production rates — it says demand tripled year over year in 2023. It also just rolled out its latest tech in February, the Track LaserWeeder, a new model that extends its capabilities by operating on diverse soil types, including muck soil – a moist, organic, black soil good for root vegetables like carrots and onions and used in specialty crop production.\n\nThe company is also beginning to expand internationally, with the first 10 LaserWeeders for the Europe ag market shipped last year, and several already operational in Australia. Carbon Robotics has also added seven European languages to the LaserWeeder's iPad operator app.\n\nAgtech is one disruptive space where the need is clear and the logic is compelling, but the market has been difficult to budge – as evidenced by challenges faced in recent years by heavily funded former Disruptor Indigo Ag. Many breakthrough ideas remain in the very early days, such as 2023 Disruptor Monarch Tractor, as well as direct competitors FarmWise, Stout Industrial Technology and K.U.L.T.\n\nThe old guard is moving on the opportunity as well, with Deere acquiring several robotics companies including Bear Flag Robotics and Blue River Technology, and pushing forward with an aggressive plan to automate the farm by 2030.\n\nTo continue its growth, Carbon Robotics raised $43 million in new capital in 2023, just over half of the $80 million it has raised since its founding.\n\nSign up for our weekly, original newsletter that goes beyond the annual Disruptor 50 list, offering a closer look at list-making companies and their innovative founders.",
      "# [Carbon Robotics brings in $70M to scale LaserWeeder by The Robot Report Staff on 2024-10-21](https://www.therobotreport.com/carbon-robotics-brings-in-70m-to-scale-laserweeder/)\nCarbon Autonomous Robotic Systems Inc. today announced that it raised $70 million in Series D funding. This latest round brings total funding for the developer of the LaserWeeder system for artificial intelligence-powered farming to $157 million since it was founded in 2018.\n\n“This funding represents a pivotal milestone, not just for our company, but [also] for farmers and consumers worldwide,” stated Paul Mikesell, founder and CEO and founder of Carbon Robotics. “We’re leading a transformative shift, and this investment accelerates our ability to pioneer AI and robotics that will reshape farming for generations to come.”\n\nCarbon Robotics said it plans to use its latest funding to scale its LaserWeeder business, introduce new software and hardware, and expand its manufacturing capabilities in Eastern Washington. It will also support the company‘s growth in new markets and continue its geographic expansion into Eastern and Southern Europe, as well as the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nLaserWeeder eliminates 10B weeds\n\nCarbon Robotics claimed that growers in North America, Europe, and Australia have eliminated weeds across 100 crop types without the use of chemical herbicides, hand labor, or soil disruption. The company said its system can increase predictability for a variety of crops, including lettuce leafy greens, onions, carrots, broccoli, and herbs.\n\nIn July, the company announced that its LaserWeeder fleet has eliminated more than 10 billion weeds worldwide since 2022. The award-winning system combines computer vision, deep-learning technology, robotics, and lasers to identify and eliminate weeds with millimeter accuracy.\n\nLaserWeeder can cut weed-control costs by 80% and increase crop yield and quality, said Carbon Robotics.\n\nIn addition to the LaserWeeder, the company offers accessories including the Carbon Ops Center, a platform for AI-powered farm operations. The center provides growers with actionable visualized data to monitor and optimize their operations.\n\nCarbon Robotics also offers a companion app, which it said empowers farm managers and operators with real-time remote insights into their LaserWeeders’ status, location, and performance.\n\nCarbon Robotics raises two rounds this year\n\nThis is Carbon Robotics’ second funding round this year. In May, it closed a round from NVentures, NVIDIA‘s venture-capital arm, but the company did not disclose financial details of the deal.\n\nNew investor BOND led Carbon Robotics’ Series D. The round also included participation from existing investors NVentures, Anthos Capital, Fuse Venture Capital, Ignition Partners, Revolution, Sozo Ventures, and Voyager Capital.\n\nAs part of the financing, Mood Rowghani, a general partner at BOND, will join the Carbon Robotics board of directors.\n\n“Carbon Robotics is uniquely positioned to deploy AI to transform the massive agriculture industry at a critical time,” said Rowghani. “Its proven ability to execute and scale, combined with a visionary leadership team, makes it a clear standout in the space. This investment reflects our strong conviction in the central role Carbon Robotics will play in shaping the future of farming.”\n\nMikesell added: “I’m excited to have the strong backing of BOND and existing investors like NVentures and to welcome Mood Rowghani to our board.”",
      "# [Top Start-Ups of 2024 - Carbon Robotics](https://www.epdtonthenet.net/article/210523/Top-Start-Ups-of-2024-Carbon-Robotics.aspx)\nUtilising a combination of expertise in mechatronics, computer vision, software development, optoelectronics and artificial intelligence (AI), Carbon Robotics has succeeded in introducing a multi-award winning AI-powered LaserWeeder robot implement. This is applicable to a broad spectrum of different crops and capable of running 24/7 for maximum productivity.\n\nName: Carbon Robotics Website: www.carbonrobotics.com\n\nFounded: 6.5 years ago Location: Seattle, USA\n\nIndustry: Agritech Technology: AI-enabled robotics\n\nVia advanced graphics processing unit (GPU) technology supplied by NVIDIA, deep learning AI models are applied to captured images (coming from 42 high-resolution camera modules). This allows the robot to differentiate between weeds and crops in real time. The weeds are then subsequently eradicated using an array of 30 150W output CO2 lasers. A 6.1m width of ground can be addressed on each pass. Sub-mm accuracy ensures the weeding operation is precise, with no harm done to the crop or any soil disruption. The high throughput achieved (with lasers being ready to fire every 50ms) is almost 2 orders of magnitude faster than what’s possible by human operatives. It results in a rate of approximately 5,000 weeds/min being killed off. Not only does this automated approach avoid having to be reliant on costly manual labour, it also means that a major reduction in herbicide usage can be realised (with clear ecological, safety and operational expense benefits all being derived). Payback on investment can take as little as a year, based on the savings made over conventional weed control methods.\n\nCarbon Robotics was founded by prolific tech entrepreneur Paul Mikesell. Following its $70 million D series funding round, which was announced only a few weeks ago, the company has now chalked up a total of $157 million in venture capital (VC) backing. The VC firms involved include NVIDIA’s financing operation NVentures, BOND Capital, Anthos Capital, Bolt, Liquid2, Fuse Venture Capital, Ignition Partners, Revolution, Sozo Ventures and Voyager Capital. As well as shipping units across the United States (to Washington, Colorado, Idaho, Florida, California, New York, etc.) plus Canada, the company has now picked up customers in France, the Netherlands, Germany, Scandinavia and Australia.\n\nAs Brett Goodwin, Carbon Robotics’ VP of Marketing, explained to EPDT; “Farmers are facing serious staffing challenges, with available human resources constantly being stretched. Having workers out in the fields pulling weeds is a waste of their abilities, taking up time that they could be using for carrying out other tasks where greater skill is required. There’s also an increasingly apparent herbicide resistance problem being witnessed, as well concerns about the health effects of spraying. Development of our LaserWeeder provides the market with a cost-effective, environmentally-sound, automated alternative, and we are starting to see a lot of uptake.”\n\nContact Details and Archive...\n\nCarbon Robotics\n\nPrint this page | E-mail this page\n\nE-mail this page\n\nYour name : Required!Recipient name : Required!Recipient e-mail : Required!Invalid!Enter the code shown : Invalid!\n\nThis website uses cookies primarily for visitor analytics.

Comparative analyses underscore the advantages of laser weeding, such as reduced environmental impact, minimized soil disturbance, and the potential for sustainable agriculture. This paper concludes by outlining key areas for future research and development to enhance the effectiveness, accessibility, and affordability of laser weeding technology. In summary, laser weeding presents a transformative solution for weed control, aligning with the principles of sustainable and environmentally conscious agriculture, and addressing the limitations of traditional methods.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe prevalence of weeds globally represents a major obstacle to crop production, significantly hindering efforts to increase crop yields and ensure food security for a massively growing population [1]. Agricultural weed control strategies encompass a range of methods, including chemical applications, mechanical tillage, plastic or dry crop mulching, and manual labor [2]. While effective and economical weed control is essential, traditional methods often have detrimental effects on the environment because they collectively pollute the environment, kill healthy plants, harm beneficial organisms, and disturb soil health [3]. The usage of the herbicides, in particular, can lead to environmental contamination, as weeds usually occupy a small portion of the treated area, resulting in herbicide drift or impact on non-target organisms [4]. Despite this, chemical control remains the dominant yet expensive and potentially dangerous method for weed management [5,6]. The global rise in herbicide-resistant weed species has further exacerbated this challenge [7], with little progress in developing new herbicide modes of action since the 1980s [8]. Consequently, concerns over the negative impacts of herbicide use have led to more stringent regulations and policy efforts to restrict their application [9,10]. While various physical weed control methods, such as electrocution, exist, laser weeding is specifically highlighted due to its precision targeting capabilities, minimal soil disturbance, and potential for use in automated systems, making it particularly suitable for high-precision and sustainable farming.\n\nIn mechanical weed control, tillage adversely affects beneficial organisms such as predatory insects and wanderers on the soil surface, as well as angleworms within the earth [1]. Additionally, widespread tillage enhances the potential for soil erosion and the leaching of essential plant nutrients. This method also encourages the unnecessary mineralization of soil organic matter and contributes to the desiccation of soils with limited moisture content [2]. The use of fire for weeding requires a substantial amount of gas to burn, which raises more concerns about its long-term environmental sustainability due to the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions associated with its operation [3]. While shallow-depth mechanical weeding reduces some environmental impacts, laser weeding offers a precision alternative with potentially lower greenhouse gas emissions when powered by renewable energy sources, which should be compared alongside other methods.\n\nMulch weed control methods utilize an organic or inorganic cover material, which could be plastic sheets or dry crop biomass, and which is placed directly on the crop rows to control weeds [4]. The application of mulch on the soil surface functions as a physical barrier, blocking the passage of light and resulting in the decreased germination of small-seeded weed species [5], but plastic mulch polyethylene sheets are costly, difficult to handle, and also degrade the quality of the soil [6]. Also, mulches have adverse effects on soil pH, allelopathy, the struggle for nutrients and CO2, disease induction, flammability, nitrogen insufficiency, pest, and weed infestation [4,7]. Woody materials used in nurseries can generate acids, like phenolic acids, during decomposition. However, under field conditions, the acidifying effect is minimal due to localized acid production and thus reduces the overall impact on soil acidity [8]. Allelochemicals leached from mulches can harm seedlings and shallow-rooted plants [9]. Plants and plant materials inside the mulch can also transfer disease to healthy crops [10]. Certain mulches can also serve as carriers for numerous weed seeds [8]. This paper focuses on laser weeding for its precision and technological potential, but acknowledges that dead mulching and living mulch systems, widely used in organic and conservation agriculture, are highly effective and warrant further comparison in future studies.\n\nWeed control methods vary in effectiveness and environmental impact. Mechanical methods, such as tilling or hoeing, are widely accessible and effective for weed removal, but they can cause soil compaction and erosion over time [2,3]. Chemical herbicides are highly efficient and easy to apply, making them popular among farmers, but their long-term use raises concerns about environmental contamination, weed resistance, and potential harm to non-target organisms [4]. Biological control, including the use of natural predators or competitive plants, offers an eco-friendly solution but is often slower and less predictable in effectiveness [5,6,7,8]. Laser weeding provides a precision approach, eliminating weeds without disturbing the soil or introducing chemicals [11,12,13]. However, it has challenges, such as high initial costs and technical limitations in crops with dense or overlapping foliage. Each method has its own advantages and limitations, requiring careful consideration depending on the specific needs of the farming system.\n\nHence, there is a necessity to develop new techniques that complement or replace existing weed control methods [11,12]. The development of new techniques is essential to address challenges like herbicide resistance and environmental impact, complementing existing methods to enhance sustainability and precision in weed control.\n\nLaser sources have the capability to deliver high-density energy to targeted objects or locations. By directing a laser beam towards a weed plant, the plant tissue can be heated, leading to harm or the death of the plant [13]. It is crucial to identify the target accurately to minimize energy consumption. Recognition tools, powered by artificial intelligence, enable real-time differentiation between weeds and crop plants in agricultural settings [14]. High-resolution cameras are capable of identifying the meristem, while precise laser scanners ensure accurate positioning [15]. As a result, laser weeding technology development has expanded, and field robots equipped with these technologies are hitting the market. Laser systems offer a precise, chemical-free alternative for weed control, potentially reducing long-term costs and environmental impact, though initial investment and performance efficiency are high and must be carefully considered against other methods.\n\nThis paper provides a detailed review of laser weeding technology and discusses its features, usage, research gaps, and comparisons with available conventional methods for weed control. Laser weeding is a new emerging technology; therefore, the cost of currently produced prototype laser weeders is highly variable and will not be presented for comparison. The mass production of laser weeding robots will decrease the price and help in making laser weeding economically competitive with current weed-control methods, and it may lead to replacing or supplementing commonly employed weed-control approaches.\n\n2. Weeding Platforms\n\nSeveral types of weeding platforms are available for field use that vary depending upon their structure, drive system, power source, working width, instrumentation, and weed control system (mechanical, flame, electric, etc.).\n\n2.1. Autonomous/Self-Propelled\n\nOne of the common research approaches across many different studies was the development of a mobile laser weeding platform operating under some form of autonomy. Xiong et al. developed a prototype laser weeding robot comprising three main subsystems: a robotic platform, a machine vision system, and a laser targeting mechanism powered by a combination of a gasoline engine and batteries. The remote-controlled laser weeder featured a frame measuring 49.5 × 39.5 × 39.5 cm (length × width × height) and was mounted at the front of the robotic platform. The robot’s overall dimensions were 150 × 65 × 65 cm [16]. In North America, Carbon Robotics introduced two types of field-scale laser weeders. One is a tractor rear-driven laser weeder equipped with 42 high-resolution cameras [17]. The second is a self-propelled laser weeder powered by Nvidia GPUs with deep learning models mounted on an autonomous platform with a 74 hp diesel engine driving four hydraulic drive motors [18]. Zhu et al. created a self-guided laser weeder tailored for corn fields, taking into account factors such as planting area, inter-row spacing, and the robot’s mechanical design. The weeder was engineered with external dimensions of 550 × 450 × 400 mm (length × width × height) [19]. Wang et al. introduced a Hyper Weeding system which was integrated at the rear of a tractor, housed within the hood [20]. Within this setup, a multispectral vision system, based on a mono-camera [20], and a laser-loaded gimbal was positioned on a three-axis gantry, enabling adaptable relocation of the system in response to field conditions. Elstone et al. utilized a laser treatment systems specifically designed to target the intra-row area, whereas a non-laser weeding method was employed for the inter-row area [21]. Rakhmatulin and Andreasen developed an affordable, compact prototype platform for a laser-based weeding system, which was experimentally tested on a combination of couch grass (Elytrigia repens (L.) Desv. ex Nevski) and tomatoes [22].\n\nThe agricultural robot, often referred to as Agribot, is a robotic system employed in farming [23]. AVO is an autonomously operated weedkiller robot powered by solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and batteries with an auto navigation system and RGB cameras. This robot communicates through Wi-Fi for shorter distances and for longer distances using a 3G/4G system. It covers four rows in a single pass with a field capacity of 10 hectares a day [24]. There is a prevailing belief that advancements in robotics science and engineering will significantly transform the landscape of agriculture. Notably, global investment and research in this field are undergoing nearly exponential growth [25]. Table 1 provides a summary of both commercial and research-based robots within the past eight years developed for weed control using a variety of end effectors.\n\n2.2. Key Components\n\nLaser source, optical system, control system, microprocessors, power supply, gantry and vision system, cameras, sensors, GPS, and mechanical drive motors are the key components in a laser weeder [16]. All these components are required to run and control laser weeders. Cameras are used to detect and identify objects and multiple types of crops and weed plants. Individual processing units are helpful to control the system by linking different devices on a single bus. To kill different weeds, an Arduino-based microcontroller boards can be used to control the entire system including the intensity of the laser through programming [33]. Edge AI cameras have been used for weed plant recognition [34]. Lithium batteries are commonly used as the main power source for small robots equipped with lasers [35]. Tertill is a mechanical weeding robot introduced by Franklin Robotics to control weeds in parks and home gardens which is equipped with capacitive sensors and trimmer string. Weeds were targeted by the combined action of robot wheels and string which disturbs the soil but this research did not report the detection of weed plants [26]. EcoRobotix developed an electrically controlled smart sprayer attached with cameras to detect and locate the crop and weed plants in row crops. It moved with a forward speed of 7 km/h and reported a field capacity of 4 ha/h [27]. TerraSentia is a small autonomous robot equipped with four HD RGB cameras and a laser to detect and collect data on under-canopy plants, i.e., maize and soybean. It has auto navigation (GPS) and communication systems [28]. Weed robot 1 was designed and tested to eliminate weeds from rice fields in Japan. This weeder was installed with four capacitive touch sensors to detect seedling and an azimuth sensor to provide directional guidance [30]. Weed robot 2 was developed for the eradication of weeds from rice and was equipped with a GNSS sensor, Raspberry pi 3, and an Arduino microcontroller. This robot communicated through Wi-Fi and was installed with magnetic, gyro, and accelerometric sensors to control the orientation and motion [31]. A prototype of a weeding platform called AgBotII was designed in Australia and tested on thistle, feather-top Rhodes grass, and wild oats. AgBotII showed 92.3% accuracy in weed detection and classification with various species [32].\n\n2.3. Working Widths\n\nMost of the laser weeders have small working widths, but a few weeders with large working widths over 6 m have also been reported. When considering the cultivation of a corn crop and the row spacing for corn planting, Zhu et al. engineered a weeding robot with specific external dimensions of 550 × 450 × 400 mm (length × width × height) based on its mechanical design [19]. The robot arm’s operational area measured 400 × 400 mm, and the weeding robot had a weight of 20 kg. The prototype for this laser weeding robot comprised three main subsystems: a robotic platform, a machine vision system, and a laser targeting mechanism, all powered by a combination of a gasoline engine and batteries [16]. A robotic laser platform with a working width of 65 cm was operated to kill the weeds in a greenhouse nursery [16]. A small prototype with a single laser was tested for the precise weeding of small weed plants targeting tissue fibrosis [33]. Working width and speed are the two main drivers of theoretical capacity, but field efficiency due to operating losses also drives actual capacity. Hence, working width is an important factor to increase the theoretical field capacity of equipment, which also helps to increase the field efficiency by reducing the number of headland turns in the field. Table 2 presents the comparative summary of reviewed studies on laser weeding technologies used over the years in the field of agriculture.\n\n3. Weed Detection\n\nWeed detection systems employing laser technology are versatile tools used across various weed control methods, including mechanical and chemical approaches. In response to the rising costs of labor and heightened concerns regarding health and environmental considerations, the adoption of site-specific weed management (SSWM) has gained considerable appeal. The initial and crucial phase in the establishment of SSWM involves the detection and recognition of weeds. Weed detection approaches are generally divided into two primary categories: machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). Figure 1 illustrates the differences between these two methods.\n\nPrevious weed recognition methods used traditional computer vision and machine learning techniques, relying on manually selected image features, such as shape, often requiring controlled conditions for capturing images [41]. However, with the success of deep learning, these manual features, which are laborious and time-consuming, are no longer needed. Deep learning can now automatically extract useful features directly from images, making the process more efficient and adaptable.\n\nDeep learning and traditional machine learning have advantages and disadvantages. Deep learning offers higher accuracy due to its ability to process complex, high-dimensional data like images. Models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are particularly effective in recognizing patterns in weed and crop images under various field conditions, leading to more accurate weed detection. Another advantage of deep learning is its ability to automatically extract features from raw data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering that traditional machine learning requires. This makes it well suited for complex environments where weeds and crops might appear similar [14].\n\nHowever, deep learning comes with notable challenges, such as the need for significant computational resources. These models require powerful hardware and large datasets to perform effectively, which can be a limitation in real-time, field-based agricultural applications [35]. Additionally, the data-hungry nature of deep learning makes it less feasible for cases where large labeled datasets are not available.\n\nOn the other hand, traditional machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees, have lower computational costs, making them more accessible for environments with limited processing power. These models can also work effectively with smaller datasets, which reduces the time and cost associated with data labeling [42]. However, their reliance on manual feature extraction limits their adaptability in diverse and dynamic agricultural environments. Moreover, traditional machine learning tends to have lower accuracy in weed detection tasks compared to deep learning, particularly in cases where weeds and crops have similar appearances [43]. Thus, while both methods have their place in agricultural applications, deep learning is becoming the more favored approach due to its superior accuracy and ability to handle complex data, despite its higher resource demands.\n\n3.1. Methods of Weed Detection\n\nThis section offers a comprehensive review of machine learning techniques are increasingly used in the development of systems for classification and weed detection. Various approaches, including neural networks (NNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and random forest regressions have been explored for this purpose [44,45]. For instance, weed detection systems utilizing the CNN architectures, such as ResNet152 and VGG16, have attained an impressive precision of 98.4% in the classification of leaf species. Although these results are promising, there remains room for further improvement. Advancing plant identification could be realized by incorporating more robust algorithms capable of accurately distinguishing a wider variety of leaf species, regardless of their color or shape [46].\n\nTo achieve precise weed elimination while avoiding crop damage, Quan et al. adapted Faster R-CNN, an object detection model, to pinpoint the locations of weeds in agricultural fields [44]. A precision rate of 97.71% was demonstrated by this model across diverse conditions, including varying weather and angles, and throughout the crop cycle. Despite these strong results, the study only focused on the detection speed of Faster R-CNN and a single cropping system (corn), that was limited to 7 frames per second, which presents real-time weed detection challenges [44].\n\nWeed detection and identification is the most crucial part of laser weeding technology and requires embedded and single-board computers in mobile applications. An example of a single-board computer used for weed detection is the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in Cambridge, UK. This device features a Quad-core Broadcom BCM2837B0 Cortex-A53 64-bit SoC running at 1.4 GHz and is equipped with 1 GB of LPDDR2 SDRAM [12]. This choice was driven by the device’s cost-effectiveness and compact form factor. The programming language used was Python 3.6, and the OpenCV 3.4.1 vision library from the University of Birmingham, UK, was utilized.\n\nHowever, the limited resources of the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, with 1 GB of RAM and a processor speed of 1.5 GHz, make it challenging to implement deep neural networks for rapid plant recognition. To address weed detection, a combination of the Viola–Jones algorithm [45] and SqueezeNet [42] was utilized. The Viola–Jones algorithm, initially developed for rapid multi-view face detection, employs Haar feature-based cascades [45] and offers real-time image feature detection.\n\nSqueezeNet, tailored for computer vision, is a type of compact deep neural network that was selected due to its small parameter count, making it suitable for the limited memory of the Raspberry Pi. The SqueezeNet model utilized 1 × 1 and 3 × 3 convolutional kernels and had a storage requirement of 5 MB [12]. Despite this setup, the time required to identify the target object in an image was around one second. This speed was deemed somewhat slow for efficient weed detection in typical field management conditions.\n\n3.2. Methods of Machine Learning\n\nIn the early stages of research, outmoded machine learning (ML) algorithms were widely utilized by scholars for distinguishing between crops and weeds. A standard approach for weed detection using machine learning involves four essential steps: data collection, pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification, as identified in previous research [46]. Hamuda et al. conducted a detailed review of image segmentation techniques for plants from 2007 to 2016, highlighting the advantages and limitations of both threshold-based methods and color index-based approaches [47].\n\nMeans-based machine learning has become a favored approach in weed detection due to its low demands for computing power and data. This method’s ability to produce interpretable results has contributed to its widespread adoption. The visual features that help distinguish between weeds and crops can be grouped into four main categories: texture [48], color [49], shape, and spectral characteristics [50].\n\nUnsupervised learning techniques have also been utilized in weed detection. Hall et al., for instance, proposed a clustering method that does not require prior knowledge, thereby removing the need to retrain systems for different weed species [51]. Due to the integral similarities between crops and weeds, particularly in the initial stages of growth, using a single feature for identification is often insufficient. Consequently, researchers have shifted toward multi-feature fusion methods, which have proven highly effective in the identification of weeds. The following section delivers an overview of multi-feature techniques employed in the past five years, emphasizing key developments and emerging patterns in the field.\n\n3.3. Deep Learning Methods\n\nThe physical creation of features in machine learning requires domain expertise and knowledge, which can limit potential improvements in accuracy. However, with the rise in powerful computing resources and large datasets, neural networks are now able to automatically learn features and optimize weights throughout their layers, leading to significant enhancements in deep learning (DL) performance. Considering the current breakthroughs in DL, it is rational to apply this technique to weed detection using machine vision. Several established neural network architectures, such as DenseNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet, have achieved cutting-edge results in this field. Deep learning approaches are generally divided into two categories based on the type of input data: graph convolutional networks (GNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [52].\n\nDeep learning can be categorized based on the labeling of data into three main types: unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and supervised learning [14]. Significant progress has been achieved, particularly in supervised and semi-supervised approaches. The following sections provide an in-depth examination of these two methods, highlighting their applications and contributions in recent years. This detailed review aims to capture recent emerging trends and advancements in the application of DL for the detection of weeds using machine vision.\n\nBargoti and Underwood evaluated three advanced detection algorithms, namely, Mask R-CNN, RetinaNet, and EfficientDet. Each model underwent training and testing for a binary problem on individual datasets. These networks, despite their distinctive features, share a foundational structure. Initially, a pre-trained classification network, known as the ‘backbone’, is utilized in a fully convolutional fashion to produce a dense representation of the input image [53]. Following this, Dollár et al. employed a modified version of the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to generate tensors with varying resolutions, enabling detection at multiple scales [54].\n\nThe models evaluated the presence of objects within predefined candidate rectangles, referred to as “anchors” which are utilized through parallel “head” modules. Specifically, a classification head is responsible for determining whether a subject belongs to the target group, while the “bounding-box refining” head adjusts the planned rectangle to improve align with the subject’s boundaries [55].\n\nMask R-CNN, an advanced model form of Faster R-CNN that incorporates selective object segmentation, operates using a two-stage model. A Region Proposal Network (RPN) filters potential anchors for further evaluation. During the training of the model, negative and positive subjects are selected to maintain a balance, and subject regions are processed in the second stage for bounding-box refinement and classification [56].\n\nRetinaNet, similar to ‘ResNet-50’ CNN in its use of Mask R-CNN and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for multi-scale illustration, functions as a single-stage network with end-to-end training. It tackles the problem of class imbalance by implementing ‘Focal Loss’, a modified cross-entropy loss function that reduces the emphasis on ‘easy examples’ during training, allowing the model to concentrate on more challenging examples [57].\n\nEfficientDet, another one-stage network like RetinaNet, employs ‘Focal Loss’ and achieves state-of-the-art results. It utilizes B4-EfficientNet as its backbone, known for higher ImageNet accuracy with fewer parameters and faster execution. EfficientDet also incorporates a modified Bi-FPN for improved feature fusion [58].\n\nThese three algorithms were selected for their reported accuracy and distinct architectural details, providing a comprehensive evaluation across different methodologies. Notably, other algorithms such as ‘You Only Look Once’ (YOLO) or ‘Single Shot Detectors’ (SSDs), focused on inference speed, were not chosen as they are less suitable for accuracy optimization [57].\n\nIn recent years, several studies have applied YOLO models to enhance weed detection in agricultural fields. A YOLOX-based blue laser weeding robot was developed specifically for corn fields, showing high precision in detecting weeds and distinguishing them from crops in real time, allowing for efficient weed removal with minimal damage to the crops [19]. A study focused on lettuce crops, using multispectral imaging in conjunction with YOLO to improve weed detection accuracy, outperforming traditional machine learning methods in complex field conditions [41]. Similarly, a lightweight, deep learning-based weed detection system was designed for a commercial laser weeding robot, utilizing YOLO for real-time detection across various field conditions, demonstrating YOLO’s adaptability and effectiveness in modern weed control systems [35]. These studies highlight YOLO’s growing role in achieving precise, real-time weed detection, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Some key performance metrics are presented in Table 3 for comparison.\n\n3.4. Camera\n\nWeed control systems have utilized a variety of cameras for detection, each with specific technical capabilities. One prominent camera used is the FLIR Blackfly 23S6C Gigabit Ethernet high-resolution camera, which features a 1920 × 1200 pixel resolution and a high dynamic range of 73.90 dB, ensuring detailed and clear imaging even under challenging light conditions. Paired with a Fujinon CF25HA-1 machine vision lens with a 25 mm focal length and a 450 × 280 mm field of view, this setup enables precise weed texture recognition at close ranges [34].\n\nIn another study, the Sony α-6000 camera, with a 24.7 MP resolution, was used for UAV-based weed detection. This camera provided high-quality images with an exposure time of 1/1250 s, ensuring rapid and accurate data capture. The camera was mounted on an octocopter platform, flying 1.5 to 3 m above the ground, taking images every second to detect weed species in real time [59]. These cameras, often optimized for agricultural environments, feature high frame rates of 10 to 60 frames per second, ensuring real-time processing capabilities crucial for deep learning-based weed detection models [60]. These studies highlight the role of advanced imaging technologies in improving precision agriculture.\n\n4. Laser Technologies\n\nA device known as a laser, which stands for “light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation”, operates as a complex apparatus generating light by means of optical amplification induced by the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. This cutting-edge technology showcases unique features such as monochromaticity, coherence, directionality, and an elevated intensity through its interaction with diverse materials [61]. The laser beam emitted demonstrates singular traits, delivering substantial energy in a focused, narrow beam that diverges minimally, distinguishing lasers from typical light sources [62].\n\nLasers stand out due to their coherence; two sources of wave are coherent when sharing identical frequencies and waveforms. This coherence enables lasers to concentrate on extremely small areas, resulting in high irradiance, or to exhibit minimal divergence, concentrating power across significant distances [63]. The wavelength in a vacuum defines lasers, offering advantages such as customizable beam divergence and shape using optics for precise energy delivery in applications like weed control.\n\nMoving beyond their underlying principles, lasers have permeated diverse industrial domains, serving purposes such as measurement, cutting, hole boring, etching, welding, and paint removal. Laser irradiation facilitates the meticulous surface adjustment of polymers with minimal surface impairment, contingent on the specific wavelength in use [33]. Certain laser types, including carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers operating at 10,600 nm, have been instrumental in tissue burning due to their absorption by water in biological cells [64]. The micrometer-range laser wavelengths find application in corneal tissue removal and addressing abnormal blood vessels in diabetic patients, contributing to the prevention of associated blindness [65].\n\nVarious laser types employ distinct active media and emit at different wavelengths. Diode lasers, powered by a semiconductor as the active medium stimulated by electrical current, encompass wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet to infrared radiation. Fiber lasers, categorized as solid-state lasers featuring a doped glass fiber as the active medium, function within the visible and near-infrared light spectrum. CO2 lasers, utilizing a gas mixture, typically nitrogen, helium, and carbon dioxide, are recognized for emitting in the far-infrared light spectrum [65,66]. The diverse applications and distinctive attributes of lasers emphasize their importance across numerous scientific, medical, and industrial domains.\n\nLaser weeding technology offers significant potential across various cropping systems, but its application must be tailored to different environments. For row crops and permanent crops, the technology can be adapted for the precision targeting of weeds without disturbing the crop. In horticulture and controlled environments such as greenhouses, laser weeding systems need further refinement to ensure optimal performance in tighter spaces and under artificial conditions. By coordinating the design and operation of these systems to suit the specific needs of each cropping system, laser weeding can become a more versatile and effective solution in modern agriculture. Different types of laser weeding platforms and autonomous robots are shown in Figure 2.\n\n4.1. Types of Lasers\n\nThree primary laser classifications exist in the field of weed control, each characterized by unique attributes and applications including carbon dioxide lasers (CO2 lasers), diode lasers, and fiber lasers [71]. Diode lasers function by exciting semiconductors through electrical currents, spanning a broad spectrum from ultraviolet to infrared wavelengths. Renowned for their adaptability, diode lasers find utility in telecommunications, medical interventions, and everyday gadgets like laser pointers. Fiber lasers, another category, leverage a doped glass fiber as the active medium, operating within the visible and near-infrared light spectrum. Fiber lasers are embraced in industry as the choice for manufacturing processes such as cutting and welding because fiber lasers offer substantial power and precise beam quality.\n\nIn the instance of both CO2 and fiber lasers, the absorption of light energy by plants results in fatal damage. A CO2 laser achieves the highest energy density by directly delivering energy to the plant’s surface. Conversely, a 2 µm fiber laser predominantly absorbs energy through the water inside the plant, causing heating across a broader plant area. A thulium-doped fiber laser operating at a 2 µm wavelength is advantageous for effective weed control because its radiation penetrates the epidermis rather than being absorbed only on the plant’s surface [72].\n\nFurthermore, emerging approaches integrate plant species recognition tools with laser equipment on compact autonomous vehicles, introducing an innovative method for weed control. This fusion is vital for sustainable laser-based weed control, as the impracticality of treating entire areas with laser beams arises due to significant energy consumption. Each laser type plays a pivotal role in advancing precision applications across diverse scientific, medical, and industrial spheres [33].\n\n4.2. Energy Requirements/Intensity\n\nThe power needs for laser-driven weed control are intricately linked to the electrical supply propelling the laser. This power is typically harnessed from fixed electrical grids for most applications, but mobile applications are much more limited. A pivotal element contributing to the efficiency of field robots in this context is the ability to efficiently utilize the electric energy in batteries or generated onboard the machine through the consumption of other fuels. The selection of laser wavelength emerges as a critical factor influencing thermal coupling and the least lethal doses for vegetation during weed control operations.\n\nIn an extensive study by Kaierle et al., focusing on the weed species Amaranthus retroflexes, it was unveiled that the overall energy demand was minimized when employing a wavelength of 10,600 nm, specifically with a CO2 laser [73]. Conversely, wavelengths of 1908 nm, 940 nm, and 532 nm, corresponding to solid-state, fiber, and diode lasers, respectively, demanded doses of 230 J, 237 J, and 1400 J per weed for effective control, underscoring the importance of selecting appropriate wavelengths.\n\nResearch findings by Marx et al. emphasized the variability in energy requirements for lethal damage, and argued that factors such as weed species, laser spot position, plant growth size, spot area, and applied laser energy must be considered [74]. Effective weeding is optimally achieved when the meristem of the target plant is exposed during the cotyledon stage or the stage with two permanent leaves. Small weeds, particularly in these early growth stages, exhibit heightened sensitivity to lasers, requiring less energy for efficient treatment. In contrast, larger plants with multiple developed meristems have a higher potential for reestablishment after laser treatment [75].\n\nA significant advantage of laser-based weed control, distinct from mechanical weeding, lies in its precision in targeting weeds in close proximity to crop plants without causing harm to leaf and roots [2]. This precision is achieved through the use of a small laser diameter and advanced optics that allow precise beam manipulation, ensuring that the meristem of the weed plant does not overlap with the crop plant. The optimization of energy usage in laser-based weed control is paramount, focusing on selectively targeting only those plants that pose a threat to crop yield or quality, thereby minimizing unnecessary energy consumption. Diode and fiber lasers are low-powered lasers ranging from 2 to 20 W which are easily operatable with a 12 VDC battery along with an additional pack to operate the system. In the comparison of herbicide and tillage methods, the sprayer requires the same amount of energy (Joules) but the mechanical weeder requires a high amount of power (J/s) to tilth and hoe the soil.\n\n4.3. Targeted Area\n\nRecent strides in artificial intelligence (AI) and the field of robotics have ushered in a new era of accuracy in identifying and locating weed and crop plants [11,22]. This technological leap allows for the precise steering of laser beams targeting the meristems of weed seedlings, enabling real-time laser control scenarios. Operating with a focus on a single spot and with restricted heat dispersion beyond the irradiated area, merely a small fraction of the field is exposed to the laser treatment. To illustrate, envision a beam of laser with a 2 mm diameter amidst 110 plants of weeds per meter square—this translates to approximately 0.31% of the total field area directly exposed [76]. This targeted precision minimizes exposure, ensuring that only the weed plant, not the soil, bears the direct impact. Such a focused approach stands out for its significant reduction in environmental impact compared to conventional methods like mechanical weeding, herbicide, and flame application. In the market, most of the mechanical weeders are unguided, which also affects the crop plants, while the target of herbicide droplets is adversely effective with sprayer and air velocity, which is the same in the case of flame application. Weeders driven by internal combustion engines produce more emission gasses.\n\nThe effectiveness of inducing harm to weed plants through lasers hinges on the beam of laser diameter. A smaller diameter concentrates the entire energy on a minute spot, amplifying its effectiveness [74]. However, navigating the fine line between efficacy and precision becomes crucial, as an excessively small diameter might not disturb enough cells to ensure the demise of the plant. This challenge is accentuated in field scenarios marked by uneven terrain, where hitting the meristem with precision becomes more intricate. Striking the right equilibrium between beam diameter and precision is pivotal for optimizing the efficacy of laser weed control technologies. In this delicate balance, the efficiency of laser-induced harm to weed plants finds its sweet spot.\n\nA key challenge in laser weeding is not only detecting and discriminating weeds from crops but also accurately targeting the critical part of the weed, such as the meristem, for effective elimination [77]. While the article discusses target area identification, further emphasis is needed on the vision system’s role in pinpointing the precise attack zone. Developing a targeting system that ensures precision, speed, and reliability under varying field conditions remains essential. Future advancements in AI-driven vision systems and real-time processing will be crucial in meeting these demands for efficient and effective weed control.\n\n4.4. Weeding Capacity\n\nIn the current landscape, the development of small autonomous vehicles tailored for laser weeding, which can also be used for tillage and herbicide applications, colloquially known as laser weeders, entails a design with a modest working width, for example, 2.2 m. Despite their compact size, these vehicles grapple with limitations in treating expansive areas when compared to their larger counterparts, such as sprayers boasting wider boom widths ranging from 24 to 40 m [71]. The intricacies of the real-time identification and precise targeting of both crop and weed plants pose challenges, potentially capping the process of weeding at a modest drive speed of 3.8–6.1 km.h−1 [78]. In dense weed scenarios (>100 m2), further reductions in driving speed may become necessary. The optimization of laser weeding efficiency involves a delicate interplay between adjusting driving speed and laser power, where higher laser power demands less time for weed control. However, the inherent constraints of the laser’s detection and targeting system may impede efforts to escalate the operating speed.\n\nIn contrast, conventional herbicide applicators such as self-propelled sprayers can operate at speeds ranging from 6 to 12 km/h and, notably, surge to 40 km/h in regions like Australia and the United States [37]. Mechanical weed control, employing diverse implements with varying working widths, often operates at speeds ranging from 4 to 12 km/h, and the advent of autonomous vehicles provides the flexibility for 24 h operations, mitigating certain capacity challenges.\n\nEfficient weed control is a common goal across various methods, be it laser weeding, herbicide application, mechanical weeding, or flame weeding. The pivotal factor for success lies in targeting weed plants when they are small, a principle applicable across diverse weed control approaches. The efficacy of weed control is also intricately tied to environmental variables, including weather conditions and the developmental stage of both weeds and crops. Although research on the impact of environmental conditions on laser performance is limited, indications suggest that lower temperatures and wet plant conditions may undermine efficacy due to the reliance on heat-based control mechanisms [79]. Laser weeding offers high precision with minimal soil disturbance, particularly in dense crops, though it has higher energy consumption and costs compared to other methods [18]. Flaming, precision hoeing, and electrocution are effective alternatives but come with drawbacks such as CO2 emissions, soil disturbance, and lower precision [80].\n\nTo overcome challenges related to capacity, the proposition of deploying a fleet of laser weeders concurrently working within the same field emerges. Alternatively, a synergistic approach entails combining laser weeding with other methods, albeit at the cost of diminishing their individual advantages. For instance, in row crops, mechanical weed control could be judiciously implemented between rows, allowing the laser weeder to focus on targeting weeds near crop plants in rows where mechanical intervention might pose risks to the delicate roots or leaves [81]. This adaptive strategy holds particular relevance in minor crops devoid of herbicide approvals and in herbicide-sensitive crops, with chemical treatment between rows using hooded sprayers and non-selective herbicides to protect crops while laser weeding takes center stage within the crop rows along with flaming and finger weeders.\n\n4.5. Dwell Time\n\nDwell time is the length of time the laser remains on the same portion of the weed. Selecting a proper dwell time should result in plant tissue damage or kill. Diode-type lasers typically take 0.5–1.5 s to harm a plant, and this time duration determines the level of harm [39]. A tracked mobile platform, combined with a weed detection module and a robotic arm equipped with a laser emitter, produced a successful kill in 0.2 ms−1 using the blue laser beam [19]. Three types of lasers were applied (0.3 W, 1 W, and 5 W) to kill the weed plants, and the 0.3 W laser required more time compared to the 5 W laser [22]. A weeding robot tested to kill the weeds in tomato plants used a CO2 laser as a light source and completely destroyed the plant in 1 s [74]. A laser weeder-equipped AI system operated to destroy certain types of weed plants required 0.64 s of dwell time per weed plant with a forward speed of 30 mm/s [16]. A laser system using a YOLOv5 model in a cornfield completed the task in 54.44 h for one hectare with an average speed of 0.09 m per second [35]. A fiber laser was tested to check its effectiveness on the weeds and it completed the job in 1.5 s with a 25 W fiber-coupled diode laser with an efficiency of 93.3% [37]. A laser weeding gimbal based on two degrees of freedom was evaluated at a distance of 535 mm from the target weed. The weeding efficiency was recorded at 0.72 s/weed with a dwell time of 0.64 s and a tracking speed of 0.1 m/s [20].\n\nTo increase the feasible working time of laser robots in the field, several strategies can be considered. Enhancing battery life or incorporating solar panels can extend operational hours. Additionally, optimizing energy efficiency through improved power management systems and using lightweight materials for the robot’s design can reduce energy consumption. Another potential solution is implementing autonomous recharging stations in the field, allowing robots to recharge without manual intervention, thus minimizing downtime [82]. Advances in AI and machine learning could also help optimize route planning, reducing time and energy spent on non-essential tasks.\n\n4.6. Efficacy of the Laser\n\nThe efficacy of laser-based weed control is intricately tied to several factors, with the diameter of the laser beam playing a pivotal role in determining its impact. Laser beams with smaller diameters concentrate energy on a smaller spot, enhancing their effectiveness in targeting weed plants [83]. However, a delicate balance must be struck, as excessively small diameters may fail to affect enough cells to ensure the demise of the targeted plant. This challenge is particularly pronounced in field scenarios with uneven terrain, where the precise targeting of the meristem becomes increasingly difficult.\n\nThe precision of laser weeding is a standout feature, allowing for the close targeting of weed plants without causing harm to the leaves and roots of neighboring crop plants [14]. This precision is achieved through the deployment of a small laser diameter and advanced optics, enabling the manipulation of the beam. The ability to avoid damage to crop plants while effectively targeting weeds is a distinctive advantage of laser weeding over traditional unguided mechanical methods.\n\nTo optimize efficiency, it is crucial to strike a balance between the diameter of the laser beam and its precision in field scenarios. While a smaller diameter allows for more focused energy delivery, it also increases the challenge of hitting the weed plant’s meristem accurately, especially in areas with rough terrain [22]. Therefore, finding the optimal combination of beam diameter and precision is essential for maximizing the efficacy of laser weed control technologies.\n\nIn comparison to chemical weeding, where the large-scale exposure of the field to treatment is common, laser weeding minimizes environmental impact by selectively targeting only the weed plants that pose a threat to crop yield or quality [12]. The targeted approach significantly reduces the area exposed to the laser treatment, mitigating the risk of unnecessary energy consumption. Moreover, the ability to treat weed plants in close proximity to crop plants without causing harm to the latter contributes to the overall efficiency of laser weeding in agricultural applications.\n\nThe use of laser weed control can be most problematic in crops that have dense foliage or closely spaced plants, such as wheat, leafy greens, or crops like lettuce and spinach. In these crops, the laser system may have difficulty distinguishing between the crop and the weeds, especially when the weeds grow in close proximity to the plants. Additionally, crops with irregular growth patterns or those grown in highly variable conditions might pose challenges for accurate weed detection. Further advancements in AI and deep learning-based image recognition could help mitigate some of these challenges in the future.\n\n4.7. Safety\n\nSafety considerations are paramount in the deployment of laser weeders, especially in the context of autonomous movement and navigation through fields. While autonomous vehicles, including laser weeders, have gained acceptance in certain experimental locations for on-road use, they pose unique challenges when operating in agricultural environments. Small autonomous agricultural robots, such as laser weeders, are subject to safety guidelines to ensure their responsible use on both private and public properties [84,85].\n\nOne crucial safety concern associated with laser weeders is the potential for the emitted collimated laser beam to generate high levels of energy, leading to heat production upon contact with surfaces. This heat can pose a fire hazard, particularly in fields containing dry materials like straw, leaves, or other organic matter. Continuous surveillance during and after laser weeding operations is essential to detect any signs of uncontrolled heating or fire [86]. Various sensors, such as smoke sensors and cameras, can be mounted on the vehicle to monitor and respond to potential risks, providing a layer of safety during and after the weeding process.\n\nBeyond fire risks, laser beams pose potential harm to both humans and animals in the vicinity. Integrating infrared cameras and sensors onto the vehicle is crucial to detect and halt its movement when approaching humans, animals, or obstacles, ensuring a safe distance is maintained. The danger lies in the laser wavelength, where exposure to laser light can cause irreversible damage, including blindness. Visible and near-infrared laser light within the 400–1400 nm range presents a serious threat to the retina, with potential for permanent damage. Laser light in the ultraviolet (UV) or far-infrared (FIR) spectrum range can harm the cornea or lens. Protective measures, such as laser-protecting glasses (O.D 6+) tailored to specific wavelengths, become essential for operators working in close proximity to the laser weeder. Moreover, employing clothing, gloves, screens, and curtains is critical for skin protection and preventing laser beams from escaping the target area due to reflections, ensuring comprehensive safety during laser weeding operations.\n\nMoreover, precautions must be taken to prevent beams of laser from escaping the working area due to reflections from stones, sand, or other reflective items. Screens and curtains can be installed to contain the laser beams within the intended treatment area, reducing the risk of unintended exposure and enhancing overall safety during laser weeding operations [12]. It is crucial to emphasize that laser beams may be invisible, and safety measures should be designed to account for these potential hazards while ensuring the well-being of operators, bystanders, and the environment.\n\n4.8. Effect on Soil\n\nLaser weeding presents advantages in terms of its impact on soil compared to traditional methods such as mechanical weed control and herbicide application [15]. Soil compaction, a common issue caused by larger and heavier tractors, is minimized with small, relatively light autonomous vehicles designed for laser weeding, other physical weed control methods, such as flaming, electrocution, and mechanical hoeing, can also be implemented using similar light platforms. These vehicles, equipped with laser technology, do not compress the soil like heavy tractors and implements used in conventional methods like long-spanned boom sprayers and 12-row inter-cultivars. Many farmers already use these methods with lighter tractors specifically to avoid the compaction issues associated with larger, heavier machinery. Therefore, the advantage of reducing soil compaction is not exclusive to laser weeding systems. A broader consideration of various physical weed control methods reveals that multiple approaches can be employed with lightweight equipment, offering viable alternatives to traditional, heavy machinery-based methods.\n\nWhile laser weeding primarily heats a specific region of the soil surface, mitigating the impact on beneficial organisms such as predatory ground beetles, spiders, and earthworms, mechanical weed control, despite its efficacy, has adverse effects on these soil-dwelling organisms [87]. Additionally, mechanical weed control contributes to the unnecessary mineralization of organic matter, the leaching of plant nutrients, and the stimulation of dormant weed seed germination. Laser weeding’s focused approach minimizes the broader impact on beneficial organisms, presenting a reduced risk of inducing widespread weed seed germination.\n\nLaser weeding’s limited interaction with the soil surface, both in terms of treated area and duration (milliseconds), contrasts with herbicide application, which typically covers the entire field area [79]. Herbicides may pose risks to various organisms over an extended period, including potential leaching into surface- and groundwater. In comparison, laser weeding’s localized impact, focused on the immediate treatment spot, allows for the rapid recolonization of microorganisms in the treated area [88,89]. While laser weeding may require multiple treatments throughout the season, especially for weed species with specific temperature requirements for seed germination, its precision and reduced impact on the overall soil environment make it a promising and environmentally friendly alternative in weed control strategies.\n\n5. Summary/Conclusions\n\nIn conclusion, laser weeding emerges as a promising and environmentally friendly alternative in weed control, offering distinct advantages over traditional methods such as mechanical weeding and herbicide application. The technology’s use with small, lightweight autonomous vehicles minimizes soil compaction, a concern commonly associated with heavier tractors. Laser weeding’s targeted approach, focusing on small areas for brief periods, reduces its impact on beneficial organisms on the soil surface, distinguishing it from the negative effects typically observed in mechanical weed control. Furthermore, its minimal interaction with the soil surface reduces the risk of triggering widespread weed seed germination, providing a more controlled and precise solution.\n\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that other physical weed control methods, such as spraying, flaming, electrocution, and mechanical hoeing, can also be mounted on small, lightweight platforms, effectively reducing soil compaction. Farmers have already been using these technologies with lighter tractors for this purpose. Therefore, while laser weeding offers certain benefits, it is not the only solution for minimizing soil disturbance.\n\nWhile multiple treatments with laser weeding may be required throughout the growing season, its ability to selectively target small areas for short durations helps minimize disruptions to the soil ecosystem. This contrasts with herbicide applications, which impact organisms across the entire field and can lead to prolonged environmental consequences. Additionally, laser weeding supports long-term sustainability goals by reducing soil disturbance and minimizing chemical inputs. Its precision, coupled with the rapid recolonization of microorganisms in treated areas, highlights its reduced impact on the overall soil environment, making it a valuable tool for modern, eco-conscious agriculture.\n\nDespite these advantages, laser weeding technology is still in its early stages and requires advancements in several areas. Increasing the field capacity and reducing dwell time from hours per hectare to minutes per hectare are crucial for improving efficiency. Automated navigation systems must also be refined to function across a range of cropping systems, including row crops, permanent crops, and horticulture. Real-time decision-making capabilities need further development to ensure precision even in dense crop conditions, such as those found in greenhouses or controlled environments.\n\nEnergy efficiency is another challenge, particularly for mobile platforms operating in the field. Innovations in power supply systems, such as improved battery storage or integration with solar technologies, are essential. Additionally, expanding the accessibility of laser weeding systems to small and medium-sized farms, while establishing regulatory and safety standards, is key for widespread adoption.\n\nUltimately, laser weeding presents a progressive solution in sustainable farming practices, offering precision and reduced environmental impact. However, it should be viewed as part of a broader integrated weed management strategy that includes other physical and agronomical methods. Addressing the current challenges through targeted research, innovation, and collaboration will be vital for realizing the full potential of laser weeding in modern agriculture.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceptualization, M.U.Y. and J.M.L.; methodology, M.U.Y.; software, M.U.Y.; validation, J.M.L. and M.U.Y.; investigation, M.U.Y. and J.M.L.; resources, J.M.L.; data curation, M.U.Y.; writing—original draft preparation, M.U.Y.; writing—review and editing, J.M.L.; visualization, J.M.L.; supervision, J.M.L.; project administration, J.M.L.; funding acquisition, J.M.L.
