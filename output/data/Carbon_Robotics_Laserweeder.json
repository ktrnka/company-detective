How many magnitudes of more hours will it take to slowly drive that delicate machinery over massive fields compared to just spraying pesticides. When the plants actually start to grow up, how will the lasers find weeds underneath leaves and other growth to shoot them? It works now cause the crop has only just sprouted, but its clearly not suitable for all stages of plant growth, which means you're purchasing a very expensive piece of equipment that you expect you'll only be able to use for like, 5-15% of the time the crops spend growing, and then you're forced to go back to pesticides for the remaining 85% of the time.\n\nIt's a cool tech demo, but it looks like it'd increase weeding costs in terms of time and money spent by a factor of like, 10X.

To be effective, it moves at around 4 miles per hour. Basically walking pace. In order to do a quarter mile section of my farm it would take 20+ hours non stop to complete if nothing goes wrong. And something ALWAYS goes wrong. And a single once over isn't going to prevent anything popping up the next day, so assume you'll need to go over sections a few times at least. In order to cover my entire farm I would need to be dragging this thing around all day, every day for a few months.\n\n\nCost is another major factor.

A sprayer these days can have a boom that’s 120 feet across and run at >25mph. Say this implement covers 30 feet horizontally and moves at 5mph, which may be generous. That’s already 20x slower. To make this work in your cash crops, I think you’ve got to make it autonomous and cheap, so farmers can run a fleet of them over more hours to make up for the speed. Of course, that’s not even mentioning the other issues brought up in this thread, namely around the efficacy of killing the weed.\n\nAll this is to say, it’s an interesting technology and I hope we continue to pursue it. However, right now, it is a bit like vertical farming — exciting and generates buzz, but with limited agricultural use cases, and probably pretty far from useful for the big cash crops which 90% of US farmland is used for.\n\n### Comment ID jqjjkcw with +3 score by [(setocsheir, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqjjkcw/) (in reply to ID jqj0zra):\nI'd say the autonomation part is coming.

We modified an airplane so we could put 12 cameras on the wings, each one taking photographs of fields over 12 different wavelengths.  Then we'd run the images through a program that would perfectly align the pixels in each image and then we would send the pixels through an algorithm.\n\nTwo features were absolutely incredible. \n\n1. We could see water content and use that data to tell irrigation systems where to water and where not to water, which would reduce the amount water a farmer would need to use to irrigate.\n2. We could detect anomalous plants and direct the software in a tractor with a sprayer system how much herbicide to use, which would reduce the overall amount of chemicals the farmer needed to spray.  Same with detecting insects and pesticide spraying.\n\nThe airplane was supposed to be a stepping stone to using satellite imagery fed through the algorithms to feed the data down to the farmer/tractor in real time.  As an alternative they were also testing mounting the cameras to the underside of high clearance tractors for a lower cost alternative.\n\nEDIT:  The science we were using is called hyperspectral imaging, which is the same technique astronomers use to tell what elements stars and planets are made of.\n\n## Comment ID jqjlg3i with +2 score by [(Prof_Cyan, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqjlg3i/) (in reply to ID 14pkhnw):\nHere come the radioactive spiders in the crops, we gonna be a nation of spidermen and spidergwen's\n\n## Comment ID jqjm2h3 with +2 score by [(OGSkip, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqjm2h3/) (in reply to ID 14pkhnw):\n“In new news, we got cancer from the lasers”\n\n## Comment ID jqjm73k with +2 score by [(mrshulgin, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqjm73k/) (in reply to ID 14pkhnw):\nDo you guys want laser-proof plants?

Herbicides, they can prevent new growth of weeds as well, so you don’t have to spray very often, it also sprays over a wide area so it doesn’t take too long to do a field. This is a small device going at a slow speed, like look at the size of the field in the video and imagine how long it would take to do that whole field. This thing would be crazy expensive to operate by comparison since you’d have to pay for fuel and the driver to go out every single week to slowly drive around your fields.

Basically each time you burn off the leaves the energy stores in the roots will get expended growing more leaves and then you have to burn those off.

This is the kind of technology we need. Granted, we also need to stop doing genetically engineered monocultures in gigantic fields - we should be building hydro- and aeroponic growing towers that are sealed against outside incursion so weed and pest control would basically not be required - but if we're going to keep doing that, using an approach like this instead of gigatons of damned glyphosate is so much nicer. \n\nComputers and precision servos and stuff aren't cheap but screw cheap, give us usable. \n\nComputers can do so much that's so far beyond a human - and of course the same is true in reverse. But there was even that laser setup that shot down mosquitos in mid-air when they entered a specific range around a tent, for instance - and it could even analyze the frequency of the mosquito's wings to make sure it only shot down female ones, the ones that actually do the blood sucking.

But that scale comes at a huge cost, a robotic arm that could just pluck what was needed/ripe would allow much greater planting density, more harvests per year, less pesticides & less water.\n\nThink of something like 3 sisters. Or an orchard, a grain below the canopy, potatoes & then mushrooms along the ground. You'd be most limited by sunlight, but even that can be supplemented if you have a green energy source nearby.\n\nBy making plots more productive with a much lower barrier of entry you could also justify moving some production closer to population centers.\n\n## Comment ID jqixtvl with +1 score by [(wildjokers, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqixtvl/) (in reply to ID 14pkhnw):\nHow does it know which ones are the weeds?

Quiet and no emissions, which is good, but a long way to go before its competitive.\n\nThe problem is they are trying to do what an ICE tractor does - they use one big motor and then use pulleys, transmissions, and gears, to distribute the power to the wheels, hydraulic pump, and PTO. This means that you can't independently control the PTO and the wheels, or the hydraulic pump and the PTO. For example he tried to use a PTO mower to mow a field, and had to do it slowly in order for the PTO to be spinning the blade fast enough, because there are only certain gear ratios available. Just silly, and shows that they are stuck thinking 'in the box'.\n\nThey really should use a bunch of smaller electric motors - one for the hydraulic pump, one for the PTO, and either one per axle or per wheel.\n\n#### Comment ID k31mtul with +3 score by [(landofcortados, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k31mtul/) (in reply to ID k30ywhj):\nI was interested in one of these, till I found out that they didn't design it with the use of a J1772 plug, which quite frankly is super annoying to have to buy another plug.

Main point to be aware of is that diesel-electric propulsion is *mainly* about reliability and simplicity of generating straight up silly amounts of torque. In terms of efficiency it rarely moves the needle - and when it does, it's often in the opposite direction from what you'd want. Though there definitely are some niche scenarios where diesel-electric is used for sake of straight fuel efficiency.\n\nOn top of that: current tractors during heavy field work already operate their diesel engines close to their peak efficiency. You literally size the tractor and implement together so that the power demands match the capacity to efficiently generate it. They need substantial amounts of torque, but definitely nothing in realms of moving 6000 ton train from standstill.\n\n## Comment ID k319hsa with +3 score by [(MX-Nacho, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k319hsa/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nI'm just seeing a very condensed article with info everybody knows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNonetheless, something that would help tremendously with costs would be EV farm equipment with swappable batteries.

Not because torque anything like that - it's all about energy density of batteries. Unlike cars and to some degree even trucks - tractors and other farming equipment uses pretty close to its max rated power continuously while working. So a moderately sized 100kW tractor will need somewhere north of 1000kWh worth of energy for a full day of heavy work. \n\nThis is just plainly difficult - single battery like that is prohibitively heavy and expensive. Fast chargers and smaller batteries that work perfectly in cars are not an option as there obviously aren't any fast chargers in the middle of a field. Systems for battery replacement and transporting them to recharge somewhere else add notable amount of logistical complexity (though curiously enough aren't necessarily *that* different from fuel deliveries straight to the field already utilized in some circumstances).\n\nIt's basically the same problem that electrification of long haul trucking faces, except 5 times *more* difficult.\n\n#### Comment ID k31ezf8 with +2 score by [(Schemen123, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k31ezf8/) (in reply to ID k31dnc4):\nFarm equipment usually has a reaaaal bad efficiency simply because ice isn't good for the load requirements of hydraulics and or mechanical power the motor does need to provide.\n\nIt definitely will benefit from at least partial electrification for example a serial hyprid approach.\n\n### Comment ID k318ulb with +2 score by [(galaxy_groundhog, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k318ulb/) (in reply to ID k318ocm):\nSolar powered tractor?!

Transporting fuel out to large unpopulated areas can't be cheap and I'm assuming farm equipment probably gets unused 12 hours a day and during the night when electricity demand is the lowest so you'd have to make minimal upgrades to infrastructure since you've got all night to charge a batter (no need for a 50kW charger).  Lets hope tractor manufacturers don't lock users out from modifying or repairing electric tractors.\n\n### Comment ID k331c2p with +1 score by [(galaxy_groundhog, Reddit, 2023-10-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k331c2p/) (in reply to ID k330b34):\nNever thought about the transporting fuel aspect\n\n### Comment ID k3hzxqa with +1 score by [(stu54, Reddit, 2023-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k3hzxqa/) (in reply to ID k330b34):\nIn the same way electric cars lead the way with the subscription buisiness model we can expect electric tractors to fall right in line with John Deer's right to repair policies.  Pay $450 for a year subscription to the features you need for your tractor 2 months out of the year.\n\n## Comment ID k33538e with +2 score by [(Googgodno, Reddit, 2023-10-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k33538e/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nHow about we eat less and waste less?\n\n### Comment ID k335ftu with +5 score by [(galaxy_groundhog, Reddit, 2023-10-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k335ftu/) (in reply to ID k33538e):\nToo simple lol\n\n## Comment ID k345pfl with +2 score by [(TheWipyk, Reddit, 2023-10-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k345pfl/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nCool concept, but I don't see how in the next 10-15 years battery tech advances enough to replace a tractor with 1000 liters of fuel tank designed to operate 12 hours under stress without needing to stop for refill.\nIn agriculture, when you need to harvest, you realy need to do it as fast as possible. You are not at liberty to charge every hour or two.\n\n## Comment ID k38qiat with +2 score by [(QuietlyGardening, Reddit, 2023-10-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k38qiat/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nI think it should have been first, frankly: \n\na lot of farmers/ranchers are REALLY ready to stick it RIGHT TO Deere/Catepillar, et al with the heinous 'right to repair' problem. If they could just wholesale move to another manufacturer interested in not seeing $$ signs over every single electronic dash indicator, creating absurd contracts, all the better. When you're trying to kill a snake, go for the head. \n\nCreating implements that totally give the finger to 'em: what a great idea.\n\nAll farms are electrified. Few farms have their own diesel/gasoline tanks. Rural rates for electricity are often lower, and charging off peak is a total no-brainer. Why not? What took so long?\n\n### Comment ID k39brgx with +2 score by [(MedicalAd6001, Reddit, 2023-10-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k39brgx/) (in reply to ID k38qiat):\nGo the the heartland sometime many farmers have multiple land plots and many of those have no buildings no utilities of any kind. Those are the ones you usually see with a storage tank on a one ton truck full of fuel or a diesel truck with a third add on tank. In the heartland area where growing corn and wheat is common you will see more of this. Farmers that raise livestock usually have power everywhere but they don't need a tractor for much if at all . What are they going to do have a 10000 foot extension cord so they can plow and seed while plugged in ?\n\n### Comment ID k3pmxad with +1 score by [(reddanit, Reddit, 2023-10-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k3pmxad/) (in reply to ID k38qiat):\n> Few farms have their own diesel/gasoline tanks\n\nFarm that doesn't have their own diesel tank is either:\n\n* Hilariously tiny hobbyist operation.\n* Relies on another company to deliver the fuel to the field.\n\nPersonally I just don't see how farming logistics are supposed to work if you don't have your own tank or reliable to-field fuel delivery service. Are you going to turn up with your 10 ton tractor, possibly with some farming implement attached at nearest gas station? Wasting possibly hours to get there and back? Would that specific set of tractor+implement be even road legal?\n\nAnd that's still just a tractor, arguably the farm vehicle that's least inconvenient to take on a public road.\n\n## Comment ID k31atjy with +4 score by [(btone911, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k31atjy/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nTractors are a terrible application for EV tech unless we're talking about small auxiliary tractors not used for full field work. Tractors typically get pulled out and set up for multiple days of consecutive work. The ability to simply refuel from your truck's diesel tank in the bed is a key feature. \n\nNot only that, there are farmers who rely on remote barns for equipment storage. Now that's a problem because the barn that the auxiliary use tractor gets parked in doesn't have a significant enough power source for charging. \n\nIf we're trying to \"clean up agriculture\" the focus needs to be on the environmental impacts of their farming processes, not their farming equipment.\n\n## Comment ID k33q0dz with +2 score by [(bkcarp00, Reddit, 2023-10-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k33q0dz/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nCan't wait for the conservative farmers to realize how much money and maintenance they will save with an EV.

Making 300kWh to 600kWh is somewhat feasible without any major innovation but at say 100kW of constant power while pulling heavy add ons it would last at most 3 to 6 hours of work, not the full day of work and some task might consume closer to 200kW. Idk if harvesters would be in a better position but while those don't need to pull anything, their internals probably consume plenty of energy to sift and sort the materials. At any rate, besides small tractors used for various tasks for short duration or short distance, at this time they are not very feasible and hybrid ones make a lot sense and while in a decade or two it will be different due to increasing energy density and lower costs but that won't be true in the next 5 years, that's pretty much guaranteed a decade or more long term problem.\n\n## Comment ID llny0o0 with +1 score by [(zukoismymain, Reddit, 2024-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/llny0o0/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nThis is the most retarded thing I've seen in my entire life\n\n## Comment ID lppnlyq with +1 score by [(Resident-Donkey-6808, Reddit, 2024-09-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/lppnlyq/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nNope it has been stated that ev tractors are not good for soil due to weight and short battery life.\n\n\nEv tractors do have potential but they are far from ready.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID k320ha8 with +1 score by [(mooktakim, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k320ha8/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nDo you even need battery powered, maybe they could be wired, with long cables\n\n## Comment ID k33chsk with +1 score by [(settlementfires, Reddit, 2023-10-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k33chsk/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nmakes sense... you're operating around a fairly central location so battery charging/swapping is easy to work in.   they're gonna save a shitload of fuel... and money.  \n\nyou could do that agrivoltaic farming, use the solar cells to charge your tractors\n\n## Comment ID k34qto8 with +1 score by [(yes_its_him, Reddit, 2023-10-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k34qto8/) (in reply to ID 16x76a9):\nIt costs about 3X what a typical 50 HP tractor costs, so that's going to be an issue in the short term.

      "# [Carbon Robotics releases new LaserWeeder model by Greg Johnson, Press Release on 2024-02-19](https://www.producebluebook.com/2024/02/19/carbon-robotics-releases-new-laserweeder-model/)\nFebruary 12, 2024 SEATTLE & TULARE, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Carbon Robotics announced the Track LaserWeeder, a new model of its proven LaserWeeder, and two software enhancements: spatial data intelligence in the Carbon Ops Center and multi-language support in the iPad operator app.\n\nBy incorporating these advancements, Carbon Robotics not only addresses the diverse needs of farmers in various regions but also empowers them with actionable farm data, aligning seamlessly with the evolving demands of agriculture.\n\n“We are excited to introduce the new Track LaserWeeder unit and software upgrades that will further improve the efficiency and capabilities of our industry-leading LaserWeeder for growers,” said Paul Mikesell, CEO and founder of Carbon Robotics. “Our customers laser weeded for more than 50,000 total hours last year across more than 100 different crops, capturing major savings in weed control costs and reporting substantial increases in crop yield and quality.”\n\nThe Track LaserWeeder offers a custom track system built in collaboration with Soucy and GK Machine and was designed with growers to extend the LaserWeeder’s usability across diverse soil types, including muck soil. By equally distributing the LaserWeeder’s weight, the tracks minimize compaction and allow the machine to enter fields earlier in the season despite challenging conditions. The first Track LaserWeeders are complete and staged for delivery beginning in March 2024.\n\n“Custom tracks extend the versatility and flexibility of the LaserWeeder and open up laserweeding to more regions and farms with varying soil types,” said John Mey, vice president of product at Carbon Robotics. “By improving ground pressure to 6.5 p.s.i. and supporting row spacing of 64” to 90”, growers in muck regions now can use LaserWeeder to do the work of a 75-person hand weeding crew, have an alternative to herbicides, and gain the production benefits resulting from no soil disruption.”\n\nCarbon Robotics also introduced visualized spatial data available to all LaserWeeder customers. This innovative offering allows growers to access field, crop and weed metrics using the Carbon Ops Center, including stand count, density, type, average size and distribution. This data allows growers to identify and address areas with inconsistencies or surprising results and provides them with quantitative crop stand counts early after planting and well before harvest.\n\nCarbon Robotics has also incorporated multi-language support into its intuitive iPad operator app, now supporting seven additional languages, including Spanish, French, German, Danish, Dutch, Polish and Romanian. This feature allows field operators to utilize the app, alerts, and Carbon support more effectively by reducing language barriers.\n\n2023 was a record year for Carbon Robotics, with a tripling number of LaserWeeders shipped to growers and rapid expansion into Europe and Australia. To support continued growth and rapid new product development, Carbon Robotics raised $43 million in new capital in 2023, bringing its total funding to $80 million since its founding in 2018.

Carbon Robotics by CNBC.com staff, www.facebook.com on 2024-05-14](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/14/carbon-robotics-cnbc-disruptor-50.html)\nAgriculture is one of the most important sectors in the history of the world, and as one of the oldest, it's also proven to be one of the hardest to disrupt in recent years. But AI as part of agtech is aiming at the farm, backed by both VC investors and existing machinery giants like Deere.\n\nCarbon Robotics is a pioneer in AI-powered agricultural robotics designed to help farmers cut costs, boost production and improve crop yield. It's best known for the LaserWeeder – which made a recent appearance on \"NBC Nightly News\" – which combines AI deep learning, computer vision, robotics and lasers to eliminate weeds down to a millimeter level of accuracy.\n\nIn a sign of how the ties between the deepest players in the field of artificial intelligence and other sectors of the economy are growing, Nvidia just announced a venture investment in Carbon Robotics in May.\n\nThe company says that it can save farmers up to 80% on weeding costs, a threat to the herbicide-agricultural complex of the past century synonymous with chemicals companies like Monsanto, Syngenta, and BASF. They are under increasing scrutiny for an approach to farming that has damaged the topsoil, left consumers with concerns about the chemicals in food, while using manufacturing processes that add to the industry's carbon footprint.\n\nThe LaserWeeder has killed over four billion weeds to date and the company estimates it can do the work of 75 farm workers. Last year, the company says customers laser weeded for more than 50,000 total hours across more than 100 different crops.\n\nIf successful at scale, the LaserWeeder will play a role in the food that reaches the everyday consumer – Carbon Robotics is targeting commercial farms with 500-plus planted acres that are selling produce to supermarkets, farms that are looking to cut costs and improve yields, and automate one of the worst jobs in the fields.\n\nIn an interview last year, CEO and founder Paul Mikesell explained how it works at a granular level: \"We're able to explode weed cell walls with a laser beam, right in the growth center of the weed, and that laser beam has no residue deposited; the organic weed matter will then turn into nutrients for the rest of the crops,\" he told produce industry publisher AndNowUKnow.\n\nIn 2023, Carbon Robotics opened two new facilities: Carbon Robotics North and its Richland, Washington-based laser refurbishing and manufacturing facility, allowing the company to increase production rates — it says demand tripled year over year in 2023. It also just rolled out its latest tech in February, the Track LaserWeeder, a new model that extends its capabilities by operating on diverse soil types, including muck soil – a moist, organic, black soil good for root vegetables like carrots and onions and used in specialty crop production.\n\nThe company is also beginning to expand internationally, with the first 10 LaserWeeders for the Europe ag market shipped last year, and several already operational in Australia. Carbon Robotics has also added seven European languages to the LaserWeeder's iPad operator app.\n\nAgtech is one disruptive space where the need is clear and the logic is compelling, but the market has been difficult to budge – as evidenced by challenges faced in recent years by heavily funded former Disruptor Indigo Ag. Many breakthrough ideas remain in the very early days, such as 2023 Disruptor Monarch Tractor, as well as direct competitors FarmWise, Stout Industrial Technology and K.U.L.T.\n\nThe old guard is moving on the opportunity as well, with Deere acquiring several robotics companies including Bear Flag Robotics and Blue River Technology, and pushing forward with an aggressive plan to automate the farm by 2030.\n\nTo continue its growth, Carbon Robotics raised $43 million in new capital in 2023, just over half of the $80 million it has raised since its founding.\n\nSign up for our weekly, original newsletter that goes beyond the annual Disruptor 50 list, offering a closer look at list-making companies and their innovative founders.",
      "# [Top Start-Ups of 2024 - Carbon Robotics](https://www.epdtonthenet.net/article/210523/Top-Start-Ups-of-2024-Carbon-Robotics.aspx)\nUtilising a combination of expertise in mechatronics, computer vision, software development, optoelectronics and artificial intelligence (AI), Carbon Robotics has succeeded in introducing a multi-award winning AI-powered LaserWeeder robot implement. This is applicable to a broad spectrum of different crops and capable of running 24/7 for maximum productivity.\n\nName: Carbon Robotics Website: www.carbonrobotics.com\n\nFounded: 6.5 years ago Location: Seattle, USA\n\nIndustry: Agritech Technology: AI-enabled robotics\n\nVia advanced graphics processing unit (GPU) technology supplied by NVIDIA, deep learning AI models are applied to captured images (coming from 42 high-resolution camera modules). This allows the robot to differentiate between weeds and crops in real time. The weeds are then subsequently eradicated using an array of 30 150W output CO2 lasers. A 6.1m width of ground can be addressed on each pass. Sub-mm accuracy ensures the weeding operation is precise, with no harm done to the crop or any soil disruption. The high throughput achieved (with lasers being ready to fire every 50ms) is almost 2 orders of magnitude faster than what’s possible by human operatives. It results in a rate of approximately 5,000 weeds/min being killed off. Not only does this automated approach avoid having to be reliant on costly manual labour, it also means that a major reduction in herbicide usage can be realised (with clear ecological, safety and operational expense benefits all being derived). Payback on investment can take as little as a year, based on the savings made over conventional weed control methods.\n\nCarbon Robotics was founded by prolific tech entrepreneur Paul Mikesell. Following its $70 million D series funding round, which was announced only a few weeks ago, the company has now chalked up a total of $157 million in venture capital (VC) backing. The VC firms involved include NVIDIA’s financing operation NVentures, BOND Capital, Anthos Capital, Bolt, Liquid2, Fuse Venture Capital, Ignition Partners, Revolution, Sozo Ventures and Voyager Capital. As well as shipping units across the United States (to Washington, Colorado, Idaho, Florida, California, New York, etc.) plus Canada, the company has now picked up customers in France, the Netherlands, Germany, Scandinavia and Australia.\n\nAs Brett Goodwin, Carbon Robotics’ VP of Marketing, explained to EPDT; “Farmers are facing serious staffing challenges, with available human resources constantly being stretched. Having workers out in the fields pulling weeds is a waste of their abilities, taking up time that they could be using for carrying out other tasks where greater skill is required. There’s also an increasingly apparent herbicide resistance problem being witnessed, as well concerns about the health effects of spraying. Development of our LaserWeeder provides the market with a cost-effective, environmentally-sound, automated alternative, and we are starting to see a lot of uptake.”\n\nContact Details and Archive...\n\nCarbon Robotics\n\nPrint this page | E-mail this page\n\nE-mail this page\n\nYour name : Required!Recipient name : Required!Recipient e-mail : Required!Invalid!Enter the code shown : Invalid!\n\nThis website uses cookies primarily for visitor analytics.

      "# [The Weeds Are Winning](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42087770)\nI've been using strong vinegar for weed control on my property for a few years now. You do have to be careful about applying it and watch the over-spray because it is not a targeted herbicide like Roundup, it's going to kill grass and broadleaf plants alike. Sometimes I lay down a tarp to mask off the grass border, for example. But if you have a general weedy area that just needs to be knocked down, or a gravel path/driveway to keep clear, I have found it is just as effective, quick-acting, and long-lasting as the synthetic herbicides, with the side effect of smelling like salad dressing, instead of smelling like cancer.\n\nI buy 30-45% concentrate depending on what is on sale, and dilute to around 10% for new weeds and 20% for full grown weeds. A little dish soap in there helps it wet down the leaves. For lawn weeds, once they are under control, I've been able to keep up with a 1/4 acre lawn with just manual weeding. Good tools help, I have tried a lot of weed pulling gadgets. Using a push mower means I go slow enough to spot them, and if they get too big they jam the mower so I am motivated to pull them while they are still small.\n\nIn an area of the lawn we needed to bury a pipeline. Soil was removed and I designed an Iris bed with stones. Weeds soon invited themselves to the composition. The rigid leaves of the Irises are now mixed with serrate leaves of Mercurialis, soft tones of Stellaria and rounded Umbilicus. I like the result, so I will tolerate it, for now.\n\nJust today, in that area, two silvery eyes where looking at me. They weren't followed with an animal face or body. Just a weed background, like if an invisible master of mimicry were hiding at plain sight. But if was not an animal, it was a weed. A weed with eyes. True history. The world is full of surprises.\n\nThe deploying leafets of an Aquilegia created perfectly symmetrical cups at each side of the stem. Sit in the cups, two identical balls of pure dew looking at me like a baby. It was just a seedling in a crevice when I picked it by a tiny leaf and found a new home for the poor thing. Today it rewarded me with some magical seconds for that.\n\nI would loathe having a garden that smells like vinegar and melted rotten leaves. Things don't need to be like this. There is a lot of fun waiting in the unplanned and untamed.\n\n> Monsanto claimed it was “highly unlikely” that glyphosate-resistant weeds would become a problem. There were, of course, those who correctly predicted that such a thing was inevitable\n\nI've started noticing that this happens all the time, across all fields. Experts disagree, the expert with the most positive outlook is the one whose opinion wins out, and we find ourselves in trouble years/decades later.\n\nI've adopted a \"treat every expert as a lawyer\" mindset now that has helped illuminate some of this for me. I prefer to listen to podcasts where people in the field talk to each other, rather than someone presenting the information to the layperson. There's a lot of jargon but you can very easily get a sense of (1) what issues does everyone agree on (2) what issues are they bickering on, and what their reasons are\n\nThe emergence of resistance to glyphosate was a given. Monsanto itself sells glyphosate-resistant plants, so we know exactly how it can evolve.\n\nThe resistant gene was isolated from an Agrobacterium strain. And these bacteria have been doing gene editing in plants for hundreds of millions of years, completely naturally. So it was just a matter of time until weeds gained the resistant genes from it. Or evolved them via a different mechanism.\n\nStill, glyphosate bought us at least six decades of relatively weed-free agriculture for staple crops. Resistance is still not universal, so glyphosate will continue working for a while, helping to lower the price of food.\n\nDespite the very large recent decreases in the price of lab-grown meat (I have just seen an announce about a company that claims that they \"can now produce 100 percent cultivated chicken (85 percent muscle and 15 percent fat) at $11.79 per pound on a large scale\"), it is not yet proven that lab-grown meat can be produced at a lower price and by consuming less resources than traditional meat.\n\nOn the other hand, it is pretty certain that it is possible to produce high-quality animal proteins, like whey protein or egg white protein, in a sustainable way and at a lower cost, by cultures of genetically-modified fungi, which can be fed with cheap carbohydrates from cereals and with minerals, unlike the animal cells which require a very complex food.\n\nThe company that has achieved the low price quoted above has done this by replacing the animal food that was given previously by everybody to the cultivated cells (e.g. serum and albumin) with some mixture of substances extracted from various vegetables.\n\nIt is unlikely that it will be ever possible for the food given to cell cultures to be cheaper than the food given to real chicken. The only chance for lab-grown meat to become cheaper than real chicken meat is given by the fact that only the edible part of a chicken is grown, i.e. the equivalent of a breast or thigh, instead of growing the entire chicken body with many parts that have a low value.\n\nWhile fungal cultures would be much more efficient than any lab-grown meat, they could provide only protein powder, which could enrich in proteins any vegetable food, but from which it would not be easy to make something resembling a steak.\n\n> and will willingly pay more for \"real\" meat even if lab grown meat could magically become cheaper,\n\nI agree with you and vouch that I am one such person. I am already in the middle of changing my lifestyle so that in some worst case scenarios I could raise my own hogs and cattle and slaughter them myself. Will be teaching my children and grandchildren to do this.\n\n\"Lab grown meat\" disgusts me, and though it's hard to say exactly how I'd behave were my ribs visible, right now I think I'd prefer to starve than eat it. Those who say they would eat it seem bizarre to me, and when I'm generous I just assume they haven't given it much thought.\n\nI do not feel as if this is tied to identity politics, I assume that there must be people like me both on the left and right, but also that there are people who would be enthusiastic about it on both sides as well. If I'm mistaken in that regard, then I must say that I have zero insight as to why that would be the case.\n\nThe EPA says that glyphosate isn't carcinogenic in humans. The WHO says that it is.\n\nThe EPA says it's not an endocrine disruptor. Numerous studies and experts suggest that it is, although I can't find any major government or NGO that agrees.\n\nI'm not a doctor or molecular biologist. How should I decide which experts to trust? I can easily afford food grown without glyphosate, so that's what I eat.\n\nEDIT: I'm not religious about this, presumably all the restaurant food I eat is grown with glyphosate. But my local grocery store only has organic produce, I usually buy that since it's convenient and the cost difference is not a big deal.\n\nYou're presumably thinking of the IARC monograph. You can read how the classifications work in their own preamble: https://monographs.iarc.who.int/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/P...\n\nSpecifically,\n\n> A cancer hazard is an agent that is capable of causing cancer, whereas a cancer risk is an estimate of the probability that cancer will occur given some level of exposure to a cancer hazard. The Monographs assess the strength of evidence that an agent is a cancer hazard. The distinction between hazard and risk is fundamental.\n\n> The identification of a cancer hazard should trigger some action to protect public health, either directly as a result of the hazard identification or through the conduct of a risk assessment.\n\nThe key thing to recognize here is they are making preliminary assessments of existing lines of research, looking for studies into whether an agent has been associated with cancer in humans, animals, or mechanistically, and characterizing the strength of such evidence, as to whether or not something can cause cancer.\n\nThe purpose of doing this is so that other standards bodies can assess the actual dose/response relationship and your probability of getting cancer from levels of exposure. Glyphosate in in group 2A, along with things like being a barber, night shift work, hot beverages, red meat. Lots of things the EPA does not ban.\n\nWhy? Because as the organization itself says, hazard does not mean risk. The fact that studies show a robust association between one thing and some increase in cancer incidence, at any dose, does not mean the level of exposure any regular person experiences raises their probability of getting cancer by any meaningful amount we should care about or regulate.\n\nThe problem here is you're almost certainly not actually reading the publications of either IARC or the EPA, which are not in conflict with each other. You're reading science journalism, which almost universally presents this in the most misleading, fear-mongering fashion possible to attract eyeballs.\n\nPretty much. The purpose of the IARC monograph is to inform other researchers and regulatory bodies to look into carcinogenic substances more closely to determine if they're worth restricting or not based on the level of risk they pose. IARC doesn't make recommendations to consumers or set standards itself. It's not meant to be a public-facing organization. That's honestly a problem with a lot of science journalism is people taking research that is meant for other scientists to propose lines of further research and add evidence to eventually come together into larger metanalyses, but then presenting these as if they are revolutionary game-changing findings on their own, which contributes to this public feeling of whiplash, as in the whole \"wait, today eggs and coffee are bad for you, but yesterday they were good?\" In reality, no single research project is saying either of those things. They're producing tiny bits of evidence one way or another that is meant for standards and recommendations bodies to aggregate and produce larger findings from.\n\nIARC's piece in this puzzle is to aggregate research showing something is a carcinogen, but this includes a lot of things that are harmless or even healthy in low doses. Sunlight, for instance, is obviously a carcinogen, but the amount of exposure you want is not zero. X-rays can cause cancer, but the optimal lifetime exposure to x-rays is not zero. Once IARC classifies these things, the purpose is to recommend to other researchers to now go look into these to find dose/response curves in animal to see what a safe and unsafe level actually is.\n\nAs far as the EPA has been able to tell, glyphosate at the level any human would ever get exposed to from its use as a pesticide, is safe, even though it's a carcinogen. Think of like being in the same city as smokers exposes you to cigarette smoke in the shared air, but at levels nowhere near enough to meaningfully raise your cancer risk in spite of the fact you're regularly breathing in carcinogens. Living in the same room with a smoker is a lot worse. Actually smoking is even worse than that. Probably don't drink straight glyphosate on a regular basis.\n\nSimilarly, you don't want to drink bleach, but cleaning your counter with bleach and then eating off of it is not only perfectly safe, but arguably even better than just eating off the counter beforehand, because bleach disinfects it.\n\nDid you read that link? Group 2 is pretty poorly explained to laypeople, Aloe Vera is listed as \"Possibly carcinogenic\", 2B.\n\nHigh concentration and quantity and long term exposure to glyphosate is probably bad for the farmers spraying, but their listing of glyphosate is completely irrelevant for the consumer buying a crop that was sprayed with it. They never once mention any danger to consumers in that entire article.\n\nEven in that limited case (occupational hazard), the data is mixed, and the IARC says that the US AHS study of 50k pesticide applicators did not find a correlation between cancer and glyphosate. They say that doesn't overrule the other findings.\n\nThey are being hyperconservative for the safety of workers. That literally doesn't apply to you, the consumer.\n\nYou don't need to grow anything. You can just eat the plants. Just be careful in how you decide what plants to eat.\n\nMy cats eat plants that somehow seem to grow out of concrete. I have no idea how a plant can even grow out of concrete at all, but it totally works.\n\nIt probably has some minerals in it. Is it very nutritious? Probably not.\n\nYou can also just eat stinging nettle. Make soup out of it. Free meal. One of the most nutritious plants that is available in almost all western countries, and probably grows outside of western countries too.\n\nIt's... I dunno why people don't trust nature or the wisdom in their bodies anymore.\n\nAnother example. Eat an apple. You're fine.\n\nDig seeds out of the apple, crush them and turn them into a paste. If you eat that paste, you will die.\n\nYet we eat apples all day. We trust apples. If something looks, feels and smells edible? Probably fine. Maybe ask a few locals like some birds, cats and dogs because they know nature a little bit better than you do probably.\n\nIf you eat in the same way that Werner Herzog makes films, you'll be invincible.",

      "# [Products, Competitors, Financials, Employees, Headquarters Locations](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/maka-autonomous-robotic-systems)\n6 Ways AI is Improving Robot Perception and Navigation Longer tool service life, lower energy consumption Carbon Robotics Secure...\n\nThe culmination of technologies within a robot allows it to understand the world around it. This perception is invaluable to humans because lasers, cameras, sensors and more collect data. These assets increase the ever-growing data set used to train artificial intelligence (AI) and help industries achieve their goals worldwide. Discover how six innovations in AI robotic perception will change the way robots move and perceive their surroundings. 1. Computer Vision Robots need more than rudimentary cameras to excel at navigation. Computer vision is next-generation robotic sight, allowing them to process stills and videos more comprehensively. They will train on these images, refining their algorithms to categorize and identify objects and people accurately. Autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) in warehouses need to predict if a human will cause a collision with unpredictable behavior. A drone on autopilot will need to know how to course-correct if other drones or birds get in the way of its survey. In a manufacturing setting, computer vision is crucial for defect detection. The enhanced perception amplifies quality control for production lines , allowing the AI to classify objects based on previously collected images of an ideal product. 2. Lidar Light detection and ranging (lidar) is another resource for advanced navigational AI in robots. This is a combination of GPS-powered scanners and lasers to recognize light bouncing off objects. It will be most deployable in unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) like self-driving cars. Not only will these robots be able to scan roadways and signage to keep passengers safe, but they could also have a sensor fusion system to make it even better. These installations create 3D maps of the environment, noticing a wandering pedestrian and when a car is drifting into its lane. Object occlusion is an oversight in current lidar systems, preventing the vehicle from understanding the potential of hidden, obscured or merged objects. Sensor fusion enables greater precision for object detection with minimal occlusion. Tests demonstrate this is viable for collision-free routing and wholly autonomous operations. 3. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) SLAM algorithms are like advanced GPS. An AI robot would create a map of its surroundings while localizing itself in the context of this creation. The more advanced SLAM technologies are, the more dynamic and accurate the map becomes. Consider this an asset for long-distance fleet drivers. Often, they face pressures to reach destinations at such speeds that they compromise their safety due to tiredness or reckless driving. SLAM encourages dynamic path routing to assist with navigation, even in unfamiliar environments . It goes beyond conventional linear robotic movement to make systems more responsive. These algorithms also benefit home smart devices, like robotic home vacuums or security systems. The devices will have boosted proficiency in measuring range to perceive every nook of the home. Combine this with lidar, and the robots become even more advanced. 4. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Installations like cobots will be a valuable supplement to numerous workforces, and they must be able to understand speech. AI algorithms within a robot will make it more adept at perceiving the nuances of language with voice recognition. The equipment will increase its accuracy when responding to spoken demands after repeated interactivity with naturally constructed language. It makes coworking with robots easier because humans could interact with them as if they were human instead of curating their speech to accommodate perception limitations. AI must improve robots this way to move forward with automation. In an era where workforce shortages plague numerous trades, a robot’s ability to alleviate workload burdens and reduce safety incidents is crucial for preserving the existing employee base. For example, the laser-cutting industry interacts with dangerous machinery daily. An AI-powered robot could listen to an operator’s command to adjust engraver dimensions without manual intervention. It eliminates numerous ergonomic challenges causing long-term pain and exposure to metals and heat. 5. Adaptive Learning Adaptive robotics takes the idea of a cobot and improves its contextualization and learning over time. This integration boosts its cognitive functions and decision-making capabilities. Adaptive robotics will also make it more straightforward for multiple robots to work together. It will acknowledge other robots as obstacles performing similar functions, adjusting its workflow to consider their efforts Additionally, adaptive learning robots will help in educational settings. Analyses of existing literature prove it could function best in these environments, enhancing public perception of AI-robotic aids. Intelligent tutoring systems create curated lessons for the learner by gaining information about the student’s needs and knowledge gaps in time. The repetitive feedback cycle drafts organized instruction without the need for another teacher. 6. Embodied AI with Enhanced Perception Embodied AI in robots engages with people in real time, compared to disembodied AI systems like chatbots. Oftentimes, these intelligences perceive environments and classify situations based on what the space contains. However, robots have always had one notable oversight in how they navigate social situations — perceiving emotional and social cues. Several circumstances demand smarter AI robots with emotional and social intelligence. Imitation and deep reinforcement learning are several options for reinforcing what gestures and facial expressions mean. Combining this with NLP to understand the sentiments behind language surrounding these physical movements will deepen the robot’s awareness further. This would be critical in customer service spaces or in the behavioral sciences. A trained robot with this AI could expedite triage in emergency care facilities based on visual pain cues instead of just working on what the patient inputs in its system. It could also detect sarcasm when responding to a customer complaint, noticing how an eye roll changes the direction of the conversation. These small but mighty tells would inform decision-making in the robot to improve service in countless sectors. Robotic Perception and Navigation AI improves navigation on roadways, production lines and anywhere else a robot can go. Industry experts must collaborate to advance and install these perception tools in robots so the workforce can benefit from their insights. The diversity of applications for AI robotic perception improvements will extend Industry 5.0 beyond its perceived potential. Its incorporation into modern technologies is critical for humanity to achieve its goals, whether surveying wind turbine safety with a drone or finding outdated products on warehouse shelves. Abstract: Numerous technologies, like advanced sensors and GPS, drove robots into their next generation of navigational potential. These assets become fully realized after integrated AI, making robots more accurate and responsive. There are six technologies to explore. Computer vision is one of the most prominent and diverse areas of AI-robot perception technology. It makes cameras more precise at recognizing imagery as stills or videos. This could yield immense value for manufacturing and production lines, especially when discovering defects. Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) is another popular resource that becomes stronger with AI. Combining LIDAR with other sensors enables sensor fusion, which improves complex navigation. Its most promising application is in autonomous vehicles. AI-informed LIDAR will be adept at identifying obstacles and detecting unusual activity, such as a wandering pedestrian. Simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms act like advanced GPS. They have mapping abilities, even in changing environments. It also encourages dynamic path planning, which is steps beyond robotic linear movement. AI also has natural language processing to make perception more attentive. This will meld with voice-recognition commands, making robots in every sector more understanding of spoken commands. Effectively automating tasks could improve safety and alleviate workload burdens. Adaptive learning insights, as robots ingest information over time, will be critical for a few reasons. First, it will improve its predictive qualities when combined with machine learning. This has an impact on multi-robot coordination. AI will make it easier for other robots to perceive activity and navigate around other machinery without collisions or redundancies. Finally, AI will work better with humans because their enhanced perception will recognize emotional and social cues from human coworkers. Consider how customer service robots in health care could identify facial expressions and how it may expedite patient triage. I will close by accenting the diversity of applications with AI in robotics and how collaboration is necessary for progressing through Industry 5.0 and into what lies beyond.",
