      "# [Privacy Policy](https://www.rescuetime.com/privacy)\nMost recent version: July 10, 2023.\n\nBy using RescueTime, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your personal information for the purposes of providing you our product services as described below. We will notify all active accounts of any significant changes to this policy.\n\nYour data is never shared\n\nYour privacy is really important to us. At RescueTime, your data, analyzed, is the product we offer back to you. We are not an ad supported company. Our free service is intended to entice you to premium service. If you have any concerns that aren't covered here, please contact us. Below are the details of this policy:\n\nWe will never sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal information, with or without personally identifying information. Furthermore, we will never share anonymized selections of your individual data. That includes any government (foreign or domestic) unless we are compelled by law. If we are required by law to disclose any of the information collected about you, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email. We will independently object to overly broad requests for access to information about users of our site.\n\nWe may share information about user behavior in the aggregate only. For example, we could share information like, \"which day of the week do people spend the most time in front of their computer?\" This type of analysis is used to enrich the product, and to represent our domain expertise to our audiences.\n\nYou can delete your data at any time — all of it, or just a slice of it. You can also delete your account at any time. Deleting your account deletes all your data from our database.\n\nWe won't spam you, ever, either directly or indirectly by sharing of email information. We might occasionally send one-time messages about important RescueTime news. We will likely continue to introduce ways that you can optionally have RescueTime contact you with data that you care about, but you will always be able to turn this on or off.\n\nFor individual accounts, no other user can see any of your data or personal information. We may provide features to allow you to share selections of your data, but this will be voluntary and opt-in only, and handled per-situation, and not buried in a terms of service.\n\nFor team accounts, sharing of data is controlled by the administrator of the account and by default does not allow anyone in the team account access to your data. No one outside of your organization will have access to any of your data. Default team implementations do not permit the sharing of individual data in any form that is not aggregated (eg, your team's average communication per week). When consulting with team implementations, we promote transparency and user driven control.\n\nHow do we protect your data?\n\nYour data is always encrypted in transit. All requests with the RescueTime web app and client apps are encrypted with current best practice SSL configurations.\n\nYour data is always encrypted at rest. All of our storage uses volume encryption.\n\nWe maintain ongoing vulnerability scanning, respond immediately to security advisories, and stay PCI compliant.\n\nWhat information does RescueTime collect? How is it used?\n\nAccount information includes email address (verification optional), city, state, and country. Optional demographic information includes gender, date of birth, industry, job title, company size, and income may be requested, to enrich the accuracy of our reporting for your work patterns.\n\nRescueTime records information about the currently active application or website on your computer. We record for processing the following information: 1) for time analysis: application name, web site URL, window title, start time of use, end time of use and 2) for distinguishing you and your device: device login name (your system user name), device name, device operating system version, and sometimes the manufacturer. For some inputs, the public internet address you are operating from is saved, for your security (and ours), and for troubleshooting. Like all activity information, it is discarded with account deletion.\n\nWe do not (and never will) collect keystrokes, form input, screenshots, window or page body content, or anything nefarious. Before storage for your reports, URLs are trimmed to the site name and sometimes top level directory when a site has distinct web apps. Query strings are discarded. Site controls allow you to selectively delete and ignore forever any item you prefer not be stored.\n\nCookies and Log Files\n\nRescueTime.com sends a \"cookie\" to your computer that contains an identifier that is unique to your browser session. We use this cookie to validate your authentication, provide you with a continuous experience, and to record how our site/service is being used. It is not used for marketing purposes.\n\nAs is done with most web sites, we log each visit to each web page. A log entry can contain information typically found in the \"header\" of your web browser's request such as the browser type you used, your Internet Protocol address, and the date and time of day. We may also log your session identifier and the URL of a site that referred you. This log information is important for security, audit, quality improvement, as well as for monitoring the health of our service.",
      "# [RescueTime Security](https://www.rescuetime.com/security)\nInfrastructure and Platform: Safe Foundations\n\nA secure design for hardware, networks, and deployments.\n\nTo make RescueTime work, there are two principle components: the application that runs on your device and the cloud-based service that processes the data and builds results for you. The client runs on multiple platforms and devices (Windows, Apple OS X, Linux, Android, ChromeOS), and is principally responsible for automatically measuring how the device is used. The client also offers some additional user-facing features that are best delivered outside the browser. The cloud service receives data from the client and also provides the client with statistics and configuration information to enrich the user's experience and manage client features.\n\nThe Client Application Platform\n\nFor desktop systems, the client is built on a common codebase using standard cross-platform libraries that work across Windows, OS X and Linux. This encompasses the code used for secure communication with our servers, as well as configuration handling and time logic. We maintain our client with regular updates, publish change information, audit and test all changes, and track dependent library security updates. Our client is designed to be lightweight, with a negligible memory and processor footprint, using a compact codebase and minimized complexity to reduce risk.\n\nFor mobile systems, we currently support automatic time collection on Android devices, including phones and tablets. Our app is built entirely inside the Android SDK and so takes advantage of the Google Android team's own security provisions (app sandboxing, regular platform maintenance updates, etc).\n\nMore about how the client works >>\n\nThe Cloud Service Platform\n\nRescueTime data processing, reporting, and account management is handled through our website locations, which are all hosted on Amazon's EC2 facility. Out of the box, EC2 gives us audited robust infrastructure security, both physical and network level. On that foundation, we provide additional feature-targeted firewalling, privilege separation and controls, two-factor access methods, and logged, auditable operations interfaces. Our website services are built on common open-source platforms, apps and frameworks that we monitor for regular security maintenance updates, both at the operating system level and for required apps and libraries.\n\nAll operational interaction with our platform is accomplished through either HTTPS or SSH (secure tunnels). Our testing and development deployments are maintained in a matching configuration, with access only through HTTPS and SSH tunnels. We do not maintain any office based data storage or services. All of our engineering resources are secured in EC2 under the same practices and policies applied to the production configuration.\n\nMore about the site and web services >>\n\nRescueTime and HIPAA, HITECH, SAS70 and more\n\nHow regulations and policies may affect you.\n\nHIPAA / HITECH: privacy and security requirements\n\nWe have clients, including individuals and teams, in many different lines of business. Some have concerns driven by protection of intellectual property, others have regulatory requirements. For those under HIPAA compliance standards for their software purchases:\n\nIs it even required? HIPAA requirements are triggered when a software product maintains patient identifiable information. For this reason, your use of RescueTime would likely be covered by HIPAA, because some applications' window titles may have a patient's name or similar small but identifiable detail. It would be possible to take advantage of our privacy configurations and controls to restrict what is captured and measured, to prevent this requirement altogether while using RescueTime. However, this may limit the utility of the product to you.\n\n... So, assuming you need HIPAA compliance to use RescueTime:\n\nSecure network transmission: HIPAA requires that all transmission of data between your business or our software be encrypted. RescueTime meets this requirement.\n\nPhysical security: The service must be hosted in an access limited and monitored facility. RescueTime meets this requirement by maintaining all resources in Amazon's EC2 data center.\n\nAccess control: Operational access to the service must be secured for authorized use only and be auditable. RescueTime meets this requirement.\n\nSafe practices and policies: The service should maintain disaster recovery plans and offsite backups. RescueTime meets this requirement, primarily by leveraging features of Amazon's EC2 service.\n\nThe HITECH supplement requires SaaS products to report intrusion or security events that effect customers' data. Specifically, the requirement is that if customer data resides in storage unencrypted (for example, a backup), even in a secured environment, that the service provider (us) must notify all and any customers whose data could have been vulnerable as the result of an intrusion event or other security violation. RescueTime guarantees its customers that it will alert any and all customers possibly affected by a security defect or hacking event.\n\nNote: At this time, RescueTime has not contracted an audit firm to provide third party validation of compliance. Please contact sales@rescuetime.com for more information on how we can accommodate your needs.\n\nSAS70 and the rest\n\nRescueTime is a fast growing business, and we contract services as needed as we continue to grow. As of this time we have not engaged our own SAS70 audit. Much of what these audits require is covered simply by operating on EC2. However, the web site services above and beyond the platform level is not. We are happy to consider all questions regarding obtaining audits. We have some clients that perform their own tests against our system to ensure we meet their standards.",

      "# [RescueTime](https://community.rescuetime.com/faq)\nThis is a Civilized Place for Public Discussion\n\nPlease treat this discussion forum with the same respect you would a public park. We, too, are a shared community resource — a place to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing conversation.\n\nThese are not hard and fast rules. They are guidelines to aid the human judgment of our community and keep this a kind, friendly place for civilized public discourse.\n\nImprove the Discussion\n\nHelp us make this a great place for discussion by always adding something positive to the discussion, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.\n\nOne way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening. Spend time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you’ll have a better chance of meeting others who share your interests.\n\nThe topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.\n\nBe Agreeable, Even When You Disagree\n\nYou may wish to respond by disagreeing. That’s fine. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Please avoid:\n\nName-calling\n\nAd hominem attacks\n\nResponding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content\n\nKnee-jerk contradiction\n\nInstead, provide thoughtful insights that improve the conversation.\n\nYour Participation Counts\n\nThe conversations we have here set the tone for every new arrival. Help us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an interesting place to be — and avoiding those that do not.\n\nDiscourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, watching, muting and so forth. Use these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else’s, too.\n\nLet’s leave our community better than we found it.\n\nIf You See a Problem, Flag It\n\nModerators have special authority; they are responsible for this forum. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.\n\nWhen you see bad behavior, don’t reply. Replying encourages bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. Just flag it. If enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.\n\nIn order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts; the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.\n\nAlways Be Civil\n\nNothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:\n\nBe civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.\n\nKeep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.\n\nRespect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.\n\nRespect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.\n\nThese are not concrete terms with precise definitions — avoid even the appearance of any of these things. If you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of a major news site.\n\nThis is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.\n\nKeep It Tidy\n\nMake the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up. So:\n\nDon’t start a topic in the wrong category; please read the category definitions.\n\nDon’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.\n\nDon’t post no-content replies.\n\nDon’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.\n\nDon’t sign your posts — every post has your profile information attached to it.\n\nRather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button. Rather than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction, use Reply as a Linked Topic.\n\nPost Only Your Own Stuff\n\nYou may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission. You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone’s intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.\n\nPowered by You\n\nThis site is operated by your friendly local staff and you, the community. If you have any further questions about how things should work here, open a new topic in the site feedback category and let’s discuss!

Users download a desktop application from RescueTime that does all the tracking work.\r\nThere is no data entry needed from the user's perspective.  The application keeps track of which window is \"in focus\" when you are on your computer, and logs what activity you are doing and for how long you are doing it.  The application also has an idle timer so if you step away from your computer RescueTime does not inflate the amount of time you spent on a given activity.\n\n- [Website](http://rescuetime.com)\n- [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/company/rescuetime)\n- [Twitter](http://twitter.com/rescuetime)\n\n## Funding (0M USD total)\n\n- 0M USD on 2008-09-23\n- 0M USD on 2007-10-14\n\n## News\n\n- Meta's Latest Game-changer: Whatsapp Flows and the Future of Conversational Shopping Experiences ([markets.businessinsider.com, 2024-03-04](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/meta-s-latest-game-changer-whatsapp-flows-and-the-future-of-conversational-shopping-experiences-1033077938))\n- 4 digital payment trends to look out for in 2021 ([Lorena Torres, 2021-01-25](https://latamlist.com/?p=8622))\n- How MoEngage, powered by AWS, is processing 1 trillion data points monthly to drive insight-led customer engagement ([Team YS, 2020-11-14](https://yourstory.com/2020/11/moengage-powered-aws-trillion-data-points-drive-customer-engagement))\n- The Best Free Google Chrome Extensions ([Eric Griffith, 2020-07-16](https://trib.al/7Z70yOL))\n- Remote work and the screen-time debate ([Megan Jenkins, 2020-05-28](https://medium.com/cgo-benchmark/remote-work-and-the-screen-time-debate-de620d4a48ad))\n- Paint Your Roam with Custom CSS ([maggieappleton.com, 2020-05-23](http://maggieappleton.com/paintingroam))\n- 6 Tools You Can Use to Improve Time Management Skills ([IntelligentHQ, 2020-05-22](https://bit.ly/2WWwaB7))\n- What I learned when I experimented with turning on notifications for a month ([Daniel Rose—RescueTime, 2019-11-08](https://www.fastcompany.com/90428031/what-one-writer-learned-when-he-turned-on-all-notifications))\n- RescueTime ([ZD Net, 2019-05-26](https://downloads.zdnet.com/product/20418-78073285/))\n- You can be much more productive.

I worry that the company may be in a downward spiral.\n\nPerhaps I'm just paranoid or it's just my design-inclined brain, but there's just little signs that make me wonder if they're trying to cut costs and at the same time improve revenue where they can. They've merged old RT in with the new and called it \"time analytics\", but didn't do anything to improve the old stuff or even simply make it look like the new UI--same with the old goals and alerts which was a huge headache for me since all of my old alerts started popping up even though they were no longer relevant.\n\nLikewise, the new design of the blog feels half-baked. Some of the new layout is kind of reflective of new design trends, but most of it feels quite antiquated and there's quite a few places with a lack of padding so that elements feel lacking in polish. There have also clearly been some articles being republished, or at least they're putting a spotlight on old ones in the emails.\n\nAnyway, I don't have any conclusive evidence.

Timesheets was a major release for us and we have heard a lot of positive feedback about how much it helps solve a truly miserable problem - having to track project time.    \n\n**Unifying the RescueTime Experience**  \nAs we discussed before, in 2021, we released a new version of RescueTime to simplify the user experience. While there were many positive changes, especially on the technical/design side, we heard from users that some key features of the traditional experience were missing, like advanced reporting and data trends. In 2024, we started to combine the best aspects of the traditional RescueTime with the modern version (desktop assistant, universal Focus Sessions, modern web experience). So far, in 2024 we have:\n\n- Opened up the traditional Time Analytics dashboard and reports for newer RescueTime users (accessible via the mode menu next to the logo)\n\n- Built a new Goals and Alerts interface, including the addition of Timesheet project goals\n\n- Updated the Windows desktop assistant for better handling of closing and minimizing\n\n- Fixed the desktop assistant issues related to unnecessary sounds\n\n- Improved the cross-device Focus Session experience, so starting a Focus Session on desktop will block apps on iOS\n\n- Updated our logo \n\nAnd coming soon…\n\n- Modernizing the design and UX of the traditional RescueTime elements (note, we are planning to release these as we finish them, so things may look a little inconsistent from a UX perspective until the work is complete).  \n\n- Streamlining the Focus Session start process into a single screen in the desktop assistant\n\n\n\nOur team remains super motivated and working hard every day to enhance your experience. We’re committed to helping our community stay protected from the constant distractions and focus on the work that matters.\n\nExpect a more formal update with these details and future roadmap plans to hit your inbox soon.\n\n### Comment ID lugoahw with +1 score by [(FiveDigitLP, Reddit, 2024-10-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RescueTime/comments/1g5vqmz/rescuetime_are_you_okay/lugoahw/) (in reply to ID lss78t1):\nThanks for your thorough response, JP!\n\nI did not consider that RescueTime’s pricing has remained the same for so long. You definitely bring up a valid point and I recognize how rare that is! As a user for several years, thank you for that!\n\nI agree that the features you mentioned in your original post are important. As my employer has been asking us to keep track of our project time more, I have found Timesheets to definitely be invaluable for me when I forget to start a timer!\n\nPersonally, the “newer” assistant still feels rough around the edges. Maybe I need to check for an update, though, because I still feel like I have some weird issues with closing and minimizing. Also, sometimes it feels like the alerts can be delayed. I will be doing distracting activities, but sometimes by the time the alert pops up I’ve already moved onto something else. I don’t know what can be done about this since I know that there is going to be some inherent delay if the assistant has to communicate back and forth with the server; likewise, I’m wondering if this issue might be exacerbated when I’m doing distracting activities on my phone.\n\nBack to the cost cutting point, at the time when I wrote this there were several aspects of the blog that when combined gave me the impression that there was a lack of care and polish with that facet of the company. In particular, there was a guest post that appeared to be republished. I don’t have an inherent problem with this, but most, if not all, of the links in the post no longer worked. I’d say this was the catalyst for me writing this post on Reddit. I have been frustrated with little things here and there with RT for a little while now, but trying to read a post and not being able to actually take action on the information it was providing brought everything to a head for me, I suppose.\n\nAnyway, thank you again for taking the time to respond. I did not expect anyone from RescueTime to actually reply. I was just venting and was interested to see if any other users were noticing something similar.\n\n## Comment ID lsguneg with +1 score by [(raider708-, Reddit, 2024-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RescueTime/comments/1g5vqmz/rescuetime_are_you_okay/lsguneg/) (in reply to ID 1g5vqmz):\nI’m completely new to rescue time, but i just subscribed to their 2 week trial based on the timesheets feature, which seems simple and perfect for a freelancer like me.

It's a great time tracking app that can help your girlfriend achieve her goals. With Unrubble, she can set up customizable alerts at regular intervals to prompt her to log her activities and categorize them. This will give her a comprehensive view of how she spends her time and identify any potential areas of improvement. Additionally, Unrubble provides detailed reports and insights, allowing her to analyze her productivity patterns. It's a valuable tool for personal time management. Have you considered using time tracking apps yourself? If so, how has it benefited you?\n\n## Comment ID kf991e3 with +2 score by [(mishalmf, Reddit, 2023-12-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/yjt1wh/time_tracking_apps/kf991e3/) (in reply to ID yjt1wh):\nI think you are describing a Life Journal ? I use Journey I have a yearly subscription.  It is something that you write now on the fly and later categorize it later. like jotting in a phone number or a pic of something in front of you or a meeting reminder. It auto tags time, date and location for that moment\n\n## Comment ID iuqb7em with +1 score by [(yallurium, Reddit, 2022-11-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/yjt1wh/time_tracking_apps/iuqb7em/) (in reply to ID yjt1wh):\nIt doesn't have a regular alarm, but rather a daily one, but I made an app for the time tracking and categorizing parts: [https://timelog.link](https://timelog.link)\n\nThe alarm every hour or any other interval is a great idea though, I've already added this to the to-do list!

The good news is that you don’t need the Chrome extension for RescueTime to work properly.\n\nIf you’ve installed the Windows or Mac desktop app, your time spent on websites in Chrome will still be tracked. The only users significantly affected by this change are Chromebook users, which represent a very small portion of our user base.\n\nWe’ll revisit our approach to the Chrome extension down the road, but for now, since it’s not critical to RescueTime’s functionality, we’re holding off on significant development until the situation stabilizes.\n\nThanks for your understanding!\n\nBest,\n\nJP",
      "# [Team Reports on 2024-06-20](https://help.rescuetime.com/article/35-team-reports)\nIn addition to the individual Premium reports accessible by each member of your team, RescueTime for Teams provides special team reports. The group reports in RescueTime for Teams will help your team members visualize their cumulative time and understand how they are working together as a group. These reports include rollup statistics about how time was spent in different categories at different times of the day or week. If Key Tools are configured, your team can also see how much time they spend using specific tools.\n\nGroup reports are accessible by everyone on the team\n\nThe reports are a tool for the entire group to see how they are working as a team. As such, they are available to all members. It lets individuals see benchmarks of team norms, and helps them understand their place in the group.\n\nTime-tracking systems within an organization often raise questions by those being tracked. Team members may worry about being \"spied on\". The best ways to address any concerns is to show potential team members what data is available in the reports and to remind them that RescueTime is not designed to be employee monitoring software. It is both a tool to help managers make smart choices about the overall team time-management strategy and a source of valuable information for the individuals on the team.\n\nIndividual data is not accessible in the group reports\n\nThe group reports only contain anonymized, aggregated information about how the team as a whole is spending its time. A manager cannot view an individual's private details or activities. Group time is aggregated, and in most cases rolled up to the category level. Key Tools are the only activities that will be displayed explicitly in team reports. This helps ensure the privacy of your team members and cuts down on a lot of noise that would make your reports less oriented toward the goal of increasing productivity as a team.\n\nAccessing Team Settings\n\nTeam settings are found in the drop down menu under the Tools icon:\n\nAccessing the group reports\n\nYou can access the group reports by clicking Reports in the top navigation, and choose Your Team:\n\nSummary Report\n\nThe summary report gives a high-level overview of how your team is spending its time. You will be able to see the total time logged for the team, the time by day, top categories and key tools, and a breakdown of patterns throughout the day. You can adjust the date and time frame using the date controls at the top of the page. You can also view time by day, week, month, or year.\n\nCategories Report\n\nThe categories report shows a detailed analysis of how time is spent across different categories. For the selected period you can see the total time in each category as well as a breakdown of how that time was spent during particular hours, days or weeks.\n\nKey Tools Report\n\nThe Key Tools report shows a detailed breakdown of how time is spent in the different key tools you have configured. For the selected period, you can see the total time in each key tool as well as a breakdown of how that time was spent across hours, days, or weeks. You can configure your key tools on the Tracking Settings page: https://www.rescuetime.com/sponsors/tracking_settings\n\nPlease note: As owner or administrator, you would set up the categories for the Key Tool activities for your team. However, your team member can change this category in their own reports. This will not alter the team reports. Suppose your team member decides to change a category in their own reports. In that case, this time will still be accounted for and applied to the category you originally set for the Key Tool activity and therefore be included in the team reports.\n\nDid this answer your question?

      "# [Honest RescueTime Review by a Competitor by Jibble.io on 2023-12-09](https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime)\nBy Asim Qureshi, CEO Jibble\n\nAs a CEO of a time tracking software company I need to know what my competitors are up to. That means my team and I are often researching about and/or playing around with their products, you know, it’s part of the job. Here, I share my findings of that research, giving credit to those competitors where credit is due and being honest about which products I believe you really need to avoid. And so, there you have it, this review, and in it, I try to be honest, fair, and insightful. I hope it helps you make the right decision…\n\nThis Review Covers:\n\nOverview\n\nWhat Do Users Like About RescueTime?\n\nWhat Don’t Users Like About RescueTime?\n\nWhat Pricing Plans Does RescueTime Offer?\n\nWhat are the Standout Features of RescueTime?\n\nSelected Positive User Feedback\n\nSelected Negative User Feedback\n\nWhat are RescueTime’s Review Ratings from Review Sites?\n\nWhat’s My Final Verdict on RescueTime?\n\nOverview\n\nRescueTime is an award-winning software marketed as a productivity assistant that records computer and device usage habits. It touts time tracking combined with intuitive analysis of activities that don’t require any manual input from users.\n\nRescueTime automatically tracks time and activities from a user’s device. The data gathered by the software is organized into reports that detail how the time has been used on sites visited, files opened, and the apps and programs used the entire day.\n\nMy favorite feature is called FocusTime, which blocks all the websites classified by the user as personal or distracting, guarding your digital workspace from social media, entertainment, and other things that might creep up unnoticed, stealing time away from the things that matter.\n\nWhile the software does work well as a time tracking and activity analysis software, it lacks some very important features commonly present in other software marketed as productivity assistants.\n\nRescueTime does not offer workforce management tools such as cost calculation, invoicing, geolocation, and other features that limit its use to mostly personal goal-chasing. While it is a valuable productivity enhancement tool, it is not a work management and productivity solution for freelancers and businesses who need more than just the analytics that RescueTime provides.\n\nAside from these limitations, RescueTime doesn’t do quite well on mobile. Users have encountered bugs that have led to loss of tracked data, or the app simply doesn’t work and data doesn’t get tracked.\n\nWhat Do Users Like About RescueTime?\n\nAutomatic and unobtrusive tracking\n\nExcellent productivity analysis\n\nGreat for reducing distractions\n\nFind more on what users love about RescueTime.\n\nWhat Don't Users Like about RescueTime?\n\nMobile app needs some improvement\n\nUI needs improvements\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\nFind more on what users hate about RescueTime.\n\nWhat Pricing Plans Does RescueTime Offer?\n\nRescueTime has two plan variants: RescueTime Lite and RescueTime Premium.\n\nLite\n\nRescueTime Lite is free and is intended to cover the basics of time management and analysis.\n\nWith this plan, users get a personalized daily Focus Work goal, real-time tracking of daily goals and access to yesterday’s results, weekly reports of activities, goals and distractions, and timely alerts to improve habits.\n\nPremium\n\nRescueTime Premium is a paid plan that costs $12 monthly or $78 annually.\n\nWith this plan, users get all RescueTime Lite features, plus Focus sessions to block distractions, calendar integrations to schedule Focus Sessions, one-click entry into meetings, meeting tracking, morning outlook with Focus Zone forecasting, history reports with date controls and spreadsheet export, and weekly and monthly progress tracking.\n\nIf we compare RescueTime Premium’s price to similar software with project management and other administration capabilities at similar price points, I can’t help but feel that they are charging so much for so little.\n\nRead 5 things you MUST know about RescueTime’s pricing.\n\nWhat are the Standout Features of RescueTime?\n\n1. FocusTime\n\nFocusTime blocks out websites that the user has pre-defined as Personal or Distractions for a duration of time set by the user. You can start a FocusTime session by selecting the Get Focused option from the desktop app, accessed by clicking on the RescueTime icon on the menu bar or system tray.\n\nYou can also start FocusTime through calendar events, where it will start automatically at the time the entry is set. Users can set up an automatic Focus Session, by having it automatically start when you have spent a user-set amount of time on personal activities.\n\nDuring FocusTime when you go to a website you listed as Personal or a Distraction, you’ll be met with a FocusTime block page. You can choose to continue to the site, rescore it to Other Work, or continue to focus.\n\nWhen a user enters into a Focus Session, all their devices connected to their RescueTime account will automatically be in focus session as well.\n\n2. Comprehensive Activity Tracking\n\nRescueTime automatically tracks all computer activity 12 to 24 hours after it is installed. It doesn’t require users to clock in or switch tasks on a dashboard every time something new is being started, except during Focus Sessions.\n\nWorking in the background, RescueTime records every website and application users open or use during user-determined periods of tracking. It can be configured to collect full window titles, document titles, and URLs for more transparent activity monitoring.\n\nUsers also have the option to specify which sites and programs should be tracked via a whitelist on the Monitoring Options page. This means that site-specific data from whitelisted sites are recorded as usual, but activities on non-whitelisted sites are recorded merely as general browsing.\n\nThe Goals feature encourages users to help improve their habits by analyzing tracked data and creating actionable plans from it. Focus Work Goals take into consideration their meeting schedules and personal information to create — and meet — realistic milestones.\n\n3. Productivity Pulse\n\nRescueTime’s Productivity Pulse is a productivity meter that calculates the score across a time period on a donut graph that displays productivity points out of a hundred a user accumulates according to their time usage.\n\nThe score is calculated as the time-weighted average of the five different categories of activities previously discussed, ranging from Focus Work Time to Distracting Time.\n\nThis feature provides an easily understandable representation of time utilization and is helpful when users need to quickly check their productivity score or to keep track of progress and set up scores to beat. Having a number to surpass is a cool way of motivating users to do better; RescueTime’s Productivity Pulse provides just the challenge to keep them on fire.\n\nSelected Positive User Feedback:\n\n“Its the best app which helps me to set goals and also in time tracking. It has the feature of automatic time tracking which helps us to understand the hours we worked.” – Verified User in Accounting (Source G2)\n\n“One of the most useful aspects of RescueTime is its ability to automatically track the time I spend on different apps and websites without the need for manual intervention. This helps me get an accurate and objective picture of my work day without extra effort, the biggest time savings I have is with these features.” – Verified Reviewer (Source Capterra)\n\n“This tool for our team has been an eye-opening tool for tracking and improving productivity. Its automatic time tracking feature helps users understand how they spend their time on the computer and mobile devices..” – Fernando L. (Source Capterra)\n\n“The best thing about RescueTime is how after setup you simply forget about it. It works 100% without interaction and at the end of each day you have a comprehensive report on all the activities you performed.” – Lucas P. (Source Capterra)\n\n“The ease of use is the best of that tool. Without having to remember to start a task or something, it silently records what you are doing in the background.” – Christian H. (Source Capterra)\n\nSelected Negative User Feedback:\n\n“Can’t use with 2fa, which is insane. RescueTime carries sensitive data that tracks everything I do, so I’m incredulous that they don’t provide the barest of protections for that data.” – T.D. Eastvold (Source Google Play)\n\n“The phone app looks very dated and needs a big UI upgrade, the web app is very nice and informative, I really wish the app could replicate what the web app can do.” – Dinerty (Source Google Play)\n\n“If it works, this app is great. But most of the time it’s busy freezing, crashing or simply not tracking any app activity. ” – Eric (Source Google Play)\n\n“Would like to see better integration between the mobile app and the Windows app, for example, focus times could force the same Android actions automagically. ” – Geoffrey T. (Source G2)\n\n“It collects all the data and sends storage to its server. I often worry about the data privacy issues with this software, Have to evaluate the tradeoff.” – Tom V. (Source G2)\n\nWhat are RescueTime's Review Ratings from Review Sites?\n\n(As of October 2024)\n\nCapterra: 4.6/5\n\nG2: 4.1/5\n\nSoftware Advice: 4.5/5\n\nTrustRadius: 7.9/10\n\nGoogle Play Store: 4.1/5\n\nApp Store: 2.0/5\n\nWhat's My Final Verdict on RescueTime?\n\nRescueTime is a great time management and productivity-boosting tool that lives up to its name by helping users take back their time from unproductive practices and habits that they may not even know they have.\n\nIt holds up a clear and truthful mirror to users by faithfully logging all activities from the moment their work day begins to the moment it ends. The data gathered from tracking activities across periods are organized into user-defined categories that rank them on a five-point scale of productivity, from very productive to very distracting.\n\nThis allows users to reflect on their time utilization and adjust their practices as needed. Over time, RescueTime helps users build healthy productivity habits.Having said that, I would like to clarify that RescueTime is not a replacement for traditional project management tools, as it lacks many important features that other similar time tracking software provide for similar pricing.\n\nIt does not have any shift scheduling capabilities, billing and invoicing features, project progress tracking tools, and accountability safeguards, among others. And while it does provide very detailed analytics, too many numbers and report variants may just prove to be too much for users looking for simpler and to-the-point reporting.\n\nOther issues that caught my attention are the usual bugs, glitches, and crashes, some very much-needed tweaking in the mobile apps to address less-than-desirable mobile experiences, and stronger assurances that users’ privacy would not be compromised by its all-encompassing activity tracking.\n\nTo sum it all up, I’d say that you should definitely get RescueTime if you want to really understand where your time goes, and want to become more productive and develop a healthier work-life balance but don’t know where to begin.\n\nBut if you are looking for a more capable and traditional time tracking and project management tool, look elsewhere as RescueTime is not that.",
      "# [RescueTime Review to Create Timesheets in 2024 by Engineering Team on 2024-02-23](https://clickup.com/blog/rescuetime-review/)\nTime is the only resource you can’t make more of. Streamlining your to-do list can certainly help, but when you’re sending out a time management SOS, you need a tool like RescueTime to throw you a life preserver.\n\nTime-tracking software is a must-have for true productivity, and that’s where RescueTime comes in. It functions as a time tracker and timesheet tool with a dose of structure, insight, and helpful but pesky reminders to keep you on track. 🏃\n\nLike any productivity tool, RescueTime has its pros and cons. If you aren’t sure whether it’s worth your time (see what we did there?), check out this RescueTime app review. We’ll explain how RescueTime works, its pros, cons, and pricing. Plus, we’ll share a great alternative to RescueTime if you decide it’s not your thing. Let’s get to it!\n\nWhat Is RescueTime?\n\nRescueTime is a time-tracking tool designed to help you master time management. Sure, it tracks your time, but this all-in-one productivity tool does more than that. It provides comprehensive insights into how you spend your time.\n\nWhether you’re a freelancer who needs to create accurate timesheets or a team leader who needs to boost productivity levels, RescueTime offers the insights you need to set and meet goals. 🏅\n\nThe tool runs quietly in the background on your computer or mobile device, whether it’s Windows, Mac, iOS, or Android, gathering data on your activity. It then compiles this data into detailed reports and graphs showcasing your most productive times, distracting websites, and how you distributed work hours between tasks.\n\nRescueTime is different than other productivity and time-tracking tools because it gives you a productivity score (which it calls the productivity pulse). This score measures how efficiently you use your time. You can also set goals for your focus time and block distractions to stay in the zone.\n\nKey RescueTime Features\n\nThere’s a lot to love about RescueTime. Compared to competitors like Toggl and Clockify, it offers a more robust way to track your time and improve time management. Optimize your work hours and say bye-bye to distractions with RescueTime’s time-saving features.\n\n1. Focus Sessions\n\nRescueTime’s main feature is Focus Session, a Pomodoro-like work sesh where you set aside a block of time for focused work. The goal is to get into a mental flow state by mono-tasking, which is the key to real productivity. 🧠\n\nWe like that RescueTime doesn’t just throw you into a Focus Session. Their setup wizard takes you through a helpful prep session that includes a body check-in, reminding you to go to the bathroom or grab water. RescueTime also asks you to go through a quick mental reset, take a deep breath, and commit to your Focus Session before you click the “start” button.\n\nUsers say they like the prep checklist and the Focus Sessions themselves. You’re free to customize the session however you see fit. For example, RescueTime integrates with Spotify to personalize the experience without opening another app.\n\nAlso, every Focus Session tells you how many other workers are in Focus Sessions worldwide in real time. Body doubling, or feeling more motivated when someone works alongside you (in person or virtually), helps you get even more out of these Focus Sessions.\n\n2. RescueTime Assistant and AI (beta)\n\nAll RescueTime accounts come with an Assistant, which gives you a customized morning forecast of the day’s meetings and to-dos. Not only that, but the RescueTime Assistant also looks at your schedule and tells you the best time for focused work in between meetings and events. 🔎\n\nThis feature is still in beta, but RescueTime is also rolling out an AI-powered assistant. Currently available only for timesheets, the AI automatically divides time between projects and clients, improving the accuracy of your time-tracking. However, the AI needs a lot of data to do this for you, so set aside plenty of time to train the model.\n\n3. Distraction alerts and blocking\n\nHow often have you sat down intending to work, only to find yourself scrolling through Instagram? It happens to the best of us. 🙈\n\nSometimes, you need to take care of business, and in a world where distractions are just a tap away, you need to take more extreme measures.\n\nWhat sets RescueTime apart from other time-tracking apps is its ability to block distractions. Tell it which apps or websites are your Kryptonite, and it will block them during every Focus Session.\n\nIf you “forget” and try to access distracting websites anyway, you’ll get a pop-up from RescueTime displaying your timer, time management goals, and a healthy guilt trip to remind you to return to work. 👀\n\n4. RescueTime community sessions\n\nRescueTime is a wiz at implementing body doubling. For extra motivation, join one of its community Focus Sessions. These are Pomodoro-style one-hour or two-hour Focus Sessions happening live worldwide.\n\nIf you don’t want to join the all-hands-on-deck RescueTime sessions, you can always create a shared space with coworkers, colleagues, or strangers while you work. This tricks your brain into thinking other people are holding you accountable and working alongside you, which works wonders for productivity.\n\n5. Time metrics\n\nAwareness is a great time management technique. At the end of every Focus Session, RescueTime will send you detailed reports and graphs illustrating your productivity pulse.\n\nThese reports break down your activities into categories such as “very productive,” “productive,” and “distracting,” allowing you to see where your time is going at a glance. RescueTime will even rank your distractions so you can pinpoint the culprits more quickly. 📌\n\nRescueTime Pricing\n\nFree version\n\nMonthly: $12/month\n\nAnnually: $6.50/month, billed annually for $78\n\nPros of Using RescueTime\n\nChoosing RescueTime as your go-to time-tracking tool comes with plenty of benefits. While RescueTime might not be right for everyone, loyal fans love the app for several reasons.\n\nImproved self-awareness\n\nRescueTime’s metrics, notifications, and distraction reminders make you more aware of your daily routine. Its detailed reports clarify how you spend time, making it easier to identify bad habits and spot opportunities for improvement. It might sting a little to get a slap on the wrist for goofing off when you’re supposed to be working, but it’s all for the sake of boosting your productivity.\n\nFewer distractions\n\nOther time management tools might say, “Hey, you’re distracted!” However, RescueTime takes things a step further by literally blocking distractions. 🛑\n\nIt blocks distracting websites and apps during your designated focus time so you can preserve concentration. This feature is heaven-sent for anyone easily sidetracked by social media and other online distractions, ensuring you give your undivided attention to the most important tasks.\n\nAutomation\n\nRescueTime also has an automatic time-tracking feature that eliminates manual time entries, boosting the accuracy of your timesheets. That’s particularly helpful for freelancers who must provide precise time reports to clients or teams needing to track project management progress.\n\nGoal-setting\n\nRescueTime differs from other solutions because it allows you to set and achieve goals in record time. Set goals for your productive time and get alerts to stay on track. It’s fully customizable, too, so you’re free to make the platform your own.\n\nSmart integrations\n\nRescueTime eliminates the headaches of hopping back and forth between solutions, tools, and platforms. Integrate it with Slack, your calendar, or other project management software to streamline your workflow.\n\nCommon Pain Points RescueTime Users Face\n\nAs much as folks love RescueTime, it has a few setbacks. Users commonly mention these pain points.\n\nLots and lots of data\n\nRescueTime can initially seem overwhelming. It generates impressive data about your habits, but it takes time to make sense of the detailed reports. Like any platform, new users frequently complain about RescueTime’s learning curve. Take time to familiarize yourself with the dashboard and reports and learn how to interpret your metrics correctly. 📈\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\nRescueTime tracks everything you do across all of your tracked devices. Some users rightfully worry about privacy, especially regarding tracking features like screenshots or detailed logs of the websites they visit. RescueTime has robust privacy policies for data governance, but you need to give up some privacy to get the full benefit of the platform.\n\nLimited free features\n\nThe free version of RescueTime doesn’t have the advanced features you’ll get in RescueTime Premium. You won’t have as much freedom to customize goals, block distractions, or generate in-depth reports, which can be a drawback for anyone on a budget. 💸\n\nSyncing issues\n\nYou’ll probably see syncing issues using RescueTime across multiple devices, like your desktop and phone. There are occasional delays or inconsistencies between the desktop and mobile apps, which could give you an inaccurate picture of your productivity.\n\nRescueTime Reviews on Reddit\n\nWhat do the people of the internet really think about RescueTime? We took to Reddit to weigh the good, the bad, and the ugly of this productivity tool.\n\nSome users say RescueTime does a great job, but several had issues with the price of RescueTime Premium ($78 annually). They also mentioned they didn’t think the premium version was much better than the free version.\n\nOther users noticed RescueTime had some pretty big time-tracking discrepancies. “ActivityWatch tracked 17m; Rescuetime said I spent only 8 minutes, which is wrong by a margin. Also, note that they haven’t made significant changes to the Windows app since 2020/05/19. Like WHAT?” one user said.\n\nSome folks said the free version worked just fine, while others liked the premium features but not the premium price. Many users mentioned switching to RescueTime alternatives because of tracking discrepancies and out-of-date apps.\n\nRescueTime has much going for it, but it isn’t the be-all, end-all. This time log tool lacks many features, so you’ll likely still be flipping between different tools to do your work.\n\nEnter ClickUp, an alternative productivity and work management platform that offers time tracking, project management, and much more. 🎯\n\nSmart project time tracking\n\nHow much time do you spend on each project, task, or client? You’ll never know for sure without ClickUp project time tracking.\n\nThis project time-tracking features allow you to track time, create estimates, add notes, and more. Whether it’s the free Chrome extension, mobile app, or desktop site, you get an accurate view of your work in a single report. 📝\n\nSpeaking of reports, ClickUpTime Tracking cards are perfect for monitoring timesheets, estimates, billing, and more. Build a custom dashboard with Time Tracking cards of your choice to get a high-level view of your most important productivity metrics in one place.\n\nSolid time management\n\nTime tracking is one thing—time management is another beast entirely. That’s why ClickUp also includes tools for time management and goal-setting. Add time estimates to any task or split time between team members to manage expectations and keep your team on task.\n\nIf you’re a visual worker, ClickUp also has something for that. Toggle between Calendar view, Gantt view, Timeline view, or Workload view for a bird’s-eye look at what’s on your plate. 🤩\n\nTime-saving templates\n\nHey, do you know what RescueTime doesn’t have? Templates.\n\nGuess what ClickUp has? Templates by the pound!\n\nYou’re in the driver’s seat with ClickUp. Pull a template and customize it to meet your team’s time-tracking needs.

      "# [The 5 best time tracking apps in 2025 by Kiera Abbamonte on 2018-09-17](https://zapier.com/blog/best-time-tracking-apps/)\nIf you spent an hour working on a client project, but no timer was around to track it, did you even do any work? (That's how that saying goes, right?)\n\nAs a freelancer, I'm responsible for every aspect of my business, from client work to marketing to record-keeping and admin. I keep detailed records of how long every business task and client project takes me, which helps me price my services accurately and avoid overbooking my schedule. But whether you're a solopreneur like me or a 9-5 office worker, knowing how you spend your time gives you crucial insight into—and control over—where you spend your energy.\n\nTime tracking apps make it easier to record billable hours, streamline your business processes, and improve your personal productivity. The best time trackers have built-in timers but also let you edit or add time manually. Some of these apps even incorporate AI for a hands-off tracking process, so you can focus on deep work and leave the analytics for later.\n\nAfter several weeks of in-depth testing, I've rounded up the best time tracking apps for individuals and teams so you can choose the app and features that match your work style best.\n\nThe best time tracking apps\n\nToggl Track for a free time tracking app\n\nMemtime for simple automated time tracking\n\nTrackingTime for visualizing time differently\n\nTimeular for automated time tracking\n\nHarvest for ease of use without sacrificing features\n\nWhat makes the best time tracking software?\n\nWhen you know how you spend your time, you can analyze your work trends and make smarter business decisions. Whether you're working solo or in a small team, time tracking software can give you a complete overview of your daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly work.\n\nWhat do you do with this information? Perhaps most importantly, project time tracking can help you get paid, allowing you to feel confident about your invoices rather than trying to estimate how much time you worked after the fact. If you're part of a team, time tracking can help you answer the question, \"What have you been working on this month?\"\n\nWhen evaluating the best time tracking apps, I considered the following criteria:\n\nReal-time tracking. Nearly all time tracking apps let you track in real time, meaning they give you a running clock that you launch when you start a task, and that you can pause or stop when you finish.\n\nThe ability to edit time tracked or manually add time blocks. The best apps let you correct time tracked after the fact, such as if you accidentally leave a timer running while you take off for lunch. You should be able to edit the time log to subtract however many minutes you weren't working. You also want an app that lets you enter a block of time post hoc in case you forget to launch a timer at all. For example, if your phone rings and you jump into a 20-minute consulting call, you might not start a timer, but you do want to log and bill for those hours worked.\n\nReporting features. The most powerful time tracking apps offer dashboards and reports that let you break out daily, weekly, or monthly time spent per project, per person, or per client.\n\nThe ability to create an invoice or export data. Once you aggregate all your time spent on your work, you have to be able to take action on it. All these apps let you either automatically create invoices from the time tracking data stored in the app or export that information into PDFs, CSVs, or Google Sheets to share with the right people.\n\nMultiple points of access. The best time tracking tools make starting a timer easy and convenient. They have the versatility to let you start a timer from wherever is most convenient to you, whether that's your browser, a desktop app, or your mobile device.\n\nBonus: AI features. Artificial intelligence is automating and simplifying workflows across tools of all industries, and time tracking apps are no exception. I gave special consideration to time trackers that use AI to auto-track your time or use machine learning to automatically assign time blocks to related tasks and projects.\n\nWhat's not included in this roundup\n\nHere, I focused specifically on finding a time tracker for freelancers, individuals, and small teams. I didn't consider employee monitoring software, which often includes some type of time tracking. I did include two automated tracking tools that monitor users' activities—but the data is for each user's eyes only. With these tools, you choose how much (if any) data to share with your supervisors. If you're looking for more team-focused apps, take a look at Zapier's picks for the best free timesheet software.\n\nAdditionally, I haven't included project management, invoicing, or accounting apps that come with an add-on or built-in time tracker. While time-tracking clocks can be very helpful inside these tools, I assume if that's what you need, you're likely shopping for a more robust solution.\n\nThe best time tracking apps at a glance\n\nBest free time tracking app\n\nToggl Track (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, Web, and browser extensions)\n\nToggl Track pros:\n\nGenerous free plan\n\nEffortless real-time tracking\n\nNumerous access points\n\nToggl Track cons:\n\nNo task management or planning features on free plan\n\nIf you need a time tracker tool but can't pay for one, you should use Toggl Track. The time tracking tool has a generous free tier of service that gives you access to all its apps (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, Web, and browser extensions) and includes all the core functionality you'd expect in a time tracking app.\n\nToggl Track works so effortlessly primarily because it doesn't ask much of you when you start timing a task. With many time tracking apps, you have to have a client, project, and task entered into your account before the app will let you track time. If you don't, you have to set your task aside for the time being and enter them. With Toggl Track, you can track your time right away, view your tracked time entries in a grid or calendar format, and worry about the details later.\n\nAdditionally, when you use Toggl Track through the Chrome or Firefox browser extension, a Toggl timer button shows up in just about every web app you could imagine, from Google Docs (and other Google apps) to Help Scout. Because you always see the Toggl Track button while you're working, you have a continual reminder to track your time. I also like keeping the desktop app open on my computer, so even if I start a timer from my browser window, the running clock will appear on my Mac's menubar. The easy accessibility from wherever I am makes Toggl's timer one of the most flexible and easiest-to-use tools I've tested.\n\nToggl Track also has some of the most detailed options I've seen in a time tracking app. For example, in the Toggl Track Chrome extension, you can automatically start and stop tracking time based on whether the browser is open or not. It also has excellent idle detection, which helps you maintain high accuracy across your records. When the app detects your computer has been idle but a timer is still running, it offers ways to correct the recorded block of time. That way, if you're interrupted while working and get sucked into a 20-minute conversation, Toggl Track can knock out those 20 minutes from your record. Toggl Track even has a Pomodoro Technique setting, so that you can work for a set amount of time on a project that requires your focus and then take a short break, all with simple stopwatch-like reminders.\n\nToggl has also recently upgraded its dashboards and reporting features for even more in-depth data analysis. You can create customized dashboards to see weekly stats or team summaries, and then generate reports filtered by team, tag, or client.\n\nFor even more flexibility, use Toggl Track's Zapier integrations to connect Toggl Track with your favorite apps, so you can start new time entries in Toggl Track when calendar events start, add new entries to a spreadsheet, and more. Learn more about how to automate Toggl Track, or get started with one of these pre-made workflows.\n\nToggl Track pricing: Free for up to 5 users; $9/user/month when billed annually for the Starter plan, which includes time rounding, billable rates, saved reports, and more.\n\nBest time tracking app for simplified auto-tracking\n\nMemtime (macOS, Windows, Linux)\n\nMemtime pros:\n\nSeamless automatic tracking\n\nSimple feature-set\n\nMemtime cons:\n\nDesktop-only\n\nPrivacy concerns with AI tracking\n\nMemtime (formerly timeBro) is a relatively new automated time tracking tool that has quickly become my new favorite. Much like Timely, Memtime is a desktop app that keeps track of your computer activity, so you can categorize it later. No more remembering to start or stop a timer; just visit the app at the end of your workday to review and categorize what you've done.\n\nWhat I love so much about Memtime is its simplicity. The other auto-tracking tools I tested have so much emphasis on team project management and timesheet creation that it's easy to become overwhelmed. If, like me, you're not collaborating on projects with others or planning to submit detailed timesheets to your supervisor, tools like Timely might be overkill. Memtime's interface is much more minimalist, with a running log of your activity, a space where you can create entries with a click, and an overview of your day's work. There's also a page for project management—where you can add clients and projects manually or import them from your other apps—and a reporting page with your productivity stats. You can also sync Memtime with your calendar to view events alongside captured activities.\n\nTo create new time entries in the Timeline view, it's easy to click on the timeline and drag your cursor to adjust the entry's duration. The display is broken down into five-minute intervals (or you can choose a one-minute breakdown if you prefer to be more granular and don't mind scrolling). Alternatively, you can use List view, which lets you drag and drop activities to log new entries.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that Memtime only works in a desktop app; no mobile app or web access. And since Memtime uses five-minute intervals by default in the Timeline view, I found the total logged work time to be less precise than Timely. But since I'm just tracking for my personal use, the simplicity of Memtime is worth the sacrifice.\n\nIf you're looking to dip your toe into automated time tracking but don't want to be overwhelmed with team or project management features, I absolutely recommend trying Memtime.\n\nMemtime pricing: $12/user/month (with a 24-month subscription) for the Basic plan, which comes with fully automated time tracking and calendar sync. The Connect plan starts at $18/user/month for project management software integration.\n\nBest time tracking app for visualizing time differently\n\nTrackingTime (Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Web, Chrome, Firefox)\n\nTrackingTime pros:\n\nGreat for time blocking and planning\n\nStraightforward interface\n\nBuilt-in project management feature\n\nTrackingTime cons:\n\nFree plan limited on features\n\nMay be too simple for some use cases\n\nTrackingTime is a collaborative time tracking tool that looks different from many other time tracking apps. It represents time in blocks or windows, just as if that working time were an event on your calendar. It's not the only app that lays out your time in this fashion, but it does offer the most opportunities for customization. For example, you can choose between a day, week, month, or team view.\n\nThe daily view has the most helpful layout I've seen, showing the full month's calendar on the left (with each day displaying an icon to show the amount of time tracked) and the day you select on the right, color-coded and organized by blocks of tracked time.\n\nTrackingTime also puts more emphasis on planning your time before you start working compared to other apps. For example, you can schedule blocks of time on your calendar for tasks you intend to work on later in the week or for recurring events, like meetings —it's almost like a combo time-tracking and time-blocking app.\n\nThe Work tab is the closest to a traditional project management tool that I've seen, with a sleek and user-friendly interface. It looks similar to an Asana list, where you can view tasks broken down by project, client, priority, or date. Clicking on a task expands a side panel where you can view tracked time, add attachments or subtasks, and set custom fields. If you're looking for a time tracker that doubles as a relatively robust task manager, TrackingTime is worth checking out.\n\nIf you'd rather keep your task manager separate, TrackingTime's Chrome extension integrates with several productivity tools, allowing you to start a timer directly from apps like Airtable, Asana, and Notion. Or you can connect TrackingTime to Zapier to help it talk to all the other apps you use. Here are a couple examples to get you started.\n\nTrackingTime pricing: Free for up to 3 users; $5.75/user/month (minimum 3 users) for the Pro plan for unlimited collaboration, advanced reporting, and team management features.\n\nBest time tracking app for automated time tracking\n\nTimeular (Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Web, Linux)\n\nTimeular pros:\n\nSeamless automatic tracking\n\nBuilt with privacy in mind\n\nOffline tracker available\n\nTimeular cons:\n\nNo free plan\n\nThe best time trackers offer features that save you time, not add to your workload. They make it seamless to record your time and add details quickly, whenever it's convenient. That's the promise of most time tracking apps—Timeular is one of the few that actually lives up to it.\n\nTimeular's automatic tracking is still in beta, but in my experience testing the app, it's the most seamless auto-tracking I've come across. My favorite way to view time is the Day view, where the app interface is set up in three columns: activities on the left, tracked time in the middle, and auto-tracked activity on the right. You can add this automatic data into your official tracked time log with as few as two clicks.\n\nIn the Activities column, every activity you've previously logged is listed. It takes one click on the play button next to any given activity to start the timer. In the left-hand menu, select Insights to view in-depth reports on how you're spending your time or Budgets to set and track detailed time budgets by client or project.\n\nYou can use Timeular via web, mobile, or desktop apps. It's one of the few apps I tested with a pretty consistent feature-set across each access point, but you'll need the desktop or mobile app to activate automatic tracking—and all that data is stored locally on your device, where it's private and secure.\n\nAnother unique feature of Timeular is the option to purchase a separate physical tracker. The tracker looks like an eight-sided die, which you can program to correlate with eight different activities, including offline work. Simply flip to the side of your choice, and the timer starts tracking and automatically syncs with the Timeular app.\n\nYou can do even more when you connect Timeular with Zapier, automating workflows like updating your Slack status, logging time across apps, and more. Here are a few workflows to get you started.\n\nTimeular pricing: From $7.50/user/month for the Personal plan, which includes unlimited automatic time tracking and standard features.\n\nBest simple time tracking app with lots of extras\n\nHarvest (Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Web, and browser extensions)\n\nHarvest pros:\n\nSuper simple time tracking flow\n\nNative invoicing and project management\n\nExtensive third-party integrations\n\nHarvest cons:\n\nSuper limited free plan\n\nIf you're looking for a dead simple solution to track your time, Harvest is a strong contender. The user experience is simple, but the app certainly isn't lacking in features.\n\nYour timesheet is the main screen you'll see when you log in. From there, it takes one click on the green plus sign to add time. Simply choose a project and category from the dropdown menus, and then either add time you've already worked or hit Start timer. Once tracked, time entries are displayed in a list on your timesheet.\n\nHarvest offers its own native invoicing, expense tracking, and project management features. Creating an invoice from tracked time is super quick, and Harvest offers similarly simple, yet in-depth, reports to track time logs, uninvoiced work, and profitability by client, project, team member, and task category.\n\nThe app even includes a Client Dashboard module, which you can enable or disable from the Settings screen. When enabled, it generates a unique URL you can share with clients to allow them to view all of their invoices and payments.\n\nHarvest offers a ton of integrations with third-party project managers, invoicing and payment software, communication tools, and more. Plus, you can automate tons of workflows when you connect Harvest with Zapier. Learn more about how to automate Harvest, or get started with one of these pre-made workflows.\n\nHarvest pricing: Free for 1 user and up to 2 projects; from $11/user/month for the Pro plan to get unlimited users and projects, team reporting, accounting and payment integrations, and more.\n\nWhat makes the best time tracker?\n\nThe right time tracking app takes the guesswork out of scheduling and accounting for your workday. Easily start and stop timers, add or edit time entries manually, and export or review your data for more accurate invoicing and planning. And you can save even more of your valuable time by automating the data flow between your other apps and your time tracker of choice. That way, you're spending your time where it matters most.\n\nRelated reading:\n\nThe best meeting schedulers\n\nThe best AI scheduling assistants\n\nThe best time blocking apps\n\nTimesheet templates to help you track your time",

      "# [RescueTime: Dive into Efficiency [with RescueTime vs Everhour] on 2024-06-02](https://everhour.com/blog/rescuetime-vs-everhour-examining-the-two/)\nMany organizations now apply the best time tracking practices to monitor employee activity and measure team performance to improve business operations. Thanks to time tracking tools, such as RescueTime, monitoring and improving productivity has never been easier. This article will shed light on RescueTime – its main features, pricing, pros & cons, tips and tricks, and compare two popular tools to determine which time tracker will be on top: RescueTime vs Everhour.\n\nWhat Is RescueTime?\n\nWe’ll begin by exploring RescueTime. The tool was created to tackle some of the problems present in the modern workplace, namely, stress, reduced productivity, and burnout. One of the best ways to improve your productivity is to understand how you spend your time, so you can make necessary adjustments. RescueTime tracks your activity on a computer or mobile device and then provides you with insights into how you spend your time.\n\nRescueTime Features\n\nRescue time provides users with a variety of useful features, which we’ll explore in more detail.\n\n🚜 Activity tracking\n\nOne of RescueTime’s best features is its activity-tracking feature. It lets users see exactly what their team members have been doing each day. The feature tracks the time a user spends on a particular website, app, or even a specific document, allowing management to review their team members’ working habits and make adjustments if necessary.\n\n🔖 Activity labeling\n\nOnce RescueTime has collected the necessary data about how you use your time, it will categorize it into how productive it is on a scale with five different productivity levels. Some websites may be deemed as distracting in some roles and productive in others. For example, scrolling through your company’s news website is part of your job if you’re a journalist. As a result, you can mark certain websites as productive rather than distracting.\n\n❗ Work goals and distraction blockers\n\nRescueTime enables you to set a personal daily work goal and allows you to block distractions when necessary during what the platform calls a ‘focus session’. The app tracks what you’re working on and will alert you when you’re beginning to lose focus or trying to work on too many tasks at one time.\n\n📊 Dashboard\n\nThis data is then presented on a dashboard. It gives you a productivity pulse and measures your productivity compared to the previous day. Additionally, the dashboard presents your activities by color: blue being productive, grey as neither productive nor distracted, and red as distracted. Finally, a table of each hour that you’ve worked that day will be populated with the color corresponding to the activity you did during that time.\n\nOnce you’ve used the app for a while, it will give you more detailed insights into how you use your time. For example, if you use the app for a couple of months, you may find that you’re particularly productive on certain days.\n\n📃 Reporting\n\nThe data recorded in the dashboard can be converted into a report, which you can download and share with whoever you like by emailing them a copy within the platform. With a premium subscription, users can view a wealth of information in reports. This includes:\n\n– Detailed activity reporting\n\n– Trends within your activity to show how you work overtime\n\n– A breakdown of your activities by an input source\n\n– The ability to view your data based on customized time filters\n\n– Exporting your data to CSV and filtering data based on specific keywords\n\n🔏 Privacy\n\nRescueTime allows you to disable the platform for certain apps and websites, giving you control over what information is recorded. You can pause the RescueTime app at any time. The app allows you to pause all RescueTime activity for 15 minutes, an hour, or until tomorrow to give you privacy.\n\nPlus, you can schedule the app to only record your activity at certain times of day, outside of these times, the app will not track your activity. That’s not all—you can also restrict which websites RescueTime logs by creating a white list of websites you would like RescueTime to track.\n\n🔁 Integrations\n\nYou can allow other apps to use your RescueTime data. The app can be integrated with several platforms, including but not limited to\n\nThese integrations enable you to get the most out of the platform. You can also export reports to a CSV file, but only if you have a premium subscription.\n\n🔧 Support and platforms\n\nRescueTime offers various support options if you encounter problems. The first port of call is the RescueTime knowledge base, where you’ll find informative articles about the platform, troubleshooting information, and FAQs. Suppose these pages do not help you fix a problem. In that case, you can contact the RescueTime team on the company website using the contact form, leave a phone message or email the team at contact@rescuetime.com.\n\nRescueTime is a web-based platform, but it also has a mobile app that lets you track mobile phone usage. The RescueTime app is available on Android and IOS.\n\n💲 Pricing\n\nRescueTime offers a free version of the app with limited features. The RescueTime premium plan, which includes all the outlined features, costs $6.50 a month per user when billed yearly.\n\n❓ Alternatives\n\nRescueTime is a great app if your main goal is to track your productivity. However, it does not offer the same billing and invoicing features as other time tracking and productivity apps on the market. If you’re looking for an alternative app to increase your productivity, consider Todoist.\n\nThe app is used by millions of people to plan and collaborate on projects of all sizes. You can write to-do lists, create labels, set priority levels to highlight your most pressing tasks, set reminders, highlight favorites, and delegate tasks to team members. Additionally, you can see tangible progress through productivity visualizations, which, by week and month, help you stay on track to achieve set goals.\n\n✅❌ Pros and cons of RescueTime\n\nWhy users might be looking for a RescueTime alternative?\n\nWhile RescueTime is fully functional and can take care of most of your needs, it’s worth taking a look at some of the drawbacks users might encounter when using it.\n\n1️⃣ Occasionally, it can be challenging to allocate a recorded activity to a specific project, particularly when managing multiple concurrent projects that require the same tools.\n\nEverhour simplifies the process of allocating recorded activities to specific projects, even when managing numerous concurrent projects with similar tool requirements.

      "# [RescueTime](https://www.softwareadvice.co.uk/software/75198/rescuetime)\nIdentify potential time wasters with RescueTime\n\nRescue time helped me to capture my app and website behaviour and thus made it possible to identify areas where I could cut back on wasting time or streamline the usage of an app. This was especially obvious with the use of e-mail. Now I try to stick to certain times a day which cut back the time of e-mail usage significantly. Also if you already have the feeling that you spent too much time with distracting activities you can block them.\n\nPros\n\nThe detailed analysis of how I use apps and websites made it possible to become more efficient when working with a computer. You can also block distractions if needed.\n\nCons\n\nPersonally I don’t have any complaints but if you don’t want to have all your app and website usage logged online then this might be a downside.\n\nBottom-Up Objectivity Yields No-brainer Accountability\n\nAbout 4 years into my business I took on outside investors. Both as a good-faith external gesture as well as internally-focused improvement, undertook a whole series of policy and operational changes to increase transparency and allow people to hold themselves accountable. One small part of these efforts was rescuetime, which 10 years later is ironically is the only single-decision that was 100% correct then and now.\n\nWe use their data as inputs to all sorts of other business processes, both weekly and for year-end reviews. I recommend it constantly, it truly is a no-brainer because as long as you can install software and spend more than a couple hours a day on computers/phones, you will get value out of it... not just immediately but over time.\n\nPros\n\nNo brainer- install it with no configuration, and you instantly get personalized and valuable weekly reports.\n\nWorks on windows/mac/linux/android/iphone so can be used by anyone in company or any external team.\n\nExcellent user-interface, very easy to customize to each user's specific goals if they choose to do so.\n\nCons\n\nThe phone-based apps didn't seem to automatically categorize calls w/known contacts.\n\nSometimes if a given site hosted applications with two different goals/intentions/categories, this at minimum much trickier to track properly and\n\nAlternatives Considered\n\nTime Doctor\n\nReasons for Switching to RescueTime\n\nRescuetime seemed like the highest quality product, better looking and had best compromise between it's free and paid plans (we use both). Probably most importantly, it does the most out of the box. We have enough things we ask employees and consultants to do, and 100% objective time tracking is always going to be valuable even if other methods are used in parallel.\n\nIf you hate tracking this is the app for you\n\nIt takes some time initially to categorize your app activities with the tag setup you want. But once it's done it's a thing of beauty. I use it to track that I'm spending enough time doing revenue generating activities for my business. And to make sure I'm not spending too much time doing things I shouldn't. I even use this to guide our company org chart. If I'm spending too much time on certain activities, I can see what is worth delegating or automating.\n\nPros\n\nLove to have a hands off time tracking app where I don't need to remember to actively track. This is set it and forget which is exactly what I needed.\n\nCons\n\nI'd love more customisation in the reports and choosing what you want to see in the weekly email reports.\n\nSlightly underwhelming\n\nI am currently trying to use rescue time for personal time trend awareness, but it seems to be more work and time spent to set up and maintain for my purposes than it saves me. I think this tool would be better if individual activities could be labelled as productive or otherwise, without needing to create a new category to apply it differently from similar tasks that are on the opposite end of the productivity spectrum. For instance, facebook should generally be a distraction, but if you use LinkedIn or other professional social media on a regular basis, it shouldn't require you to create a special setup just to have that one app or website treated as productive time without labeling facebook as the same importance. Seems like an oversight to me, but perhaps I just needed to use the category system more readily.\n\nPros\n\nThis software does pick up a lot of useful data, and allows you to quickly see what things you do on the computer and how the trends flow during your day or week. There is a lot of good information, simple to install and use generally, and overall a decent experience.\n\nCons\n\nI dislike the fact that you can't really customize things without lots of tedium in the categories and other areas. Also, the ability to change tracked sections of the day or week are somewhat limited; there are only one or two generic filters for declaring which days and hours to run the tracking. I have noticed that the categories are geared mostly toward organizations more than individuals. I have realized that if I customize categories to make a certain activity productive time instead of distracted time, it won't let me change just that one activity to be productive without bringing the entire category along with it.\n\nBest way to discover how well you lose/use your time\n\nUsing Rescue Time has been invaluable as an easy way to track my productivity & effectiveness. It has enabled me to reduce my distractions as well as use my more productive times more efficiently.\n\nPros\n\nEasy to understand tracked data on the dashboard. Visual charts are impactful & very helpful. It can be quite surprising to see how much time I can waste & also how much good time I have put into my work & projects including when I seem to be most creative/productive. Also it's great that it can track my activity across my devices eg my laptop & my phone to give a better picture of how I am using/losing my time.\n\nCons\n\nAlthough the dashboard is accessed through a web browser, it is still necessary to download software to run on your computer & phone too.",

      "# [A Guide to Virtual Collaboration for Creative Agencies in 2025](https://www.manyrequests.com/blog/virtual-collaboration)\nImagine this:\n\nYou're a creative agency owner working on a social media campaign.\n\nYou communicate and assign a design to your graphic designer over email, send brief and other project files to your copywriter via LinkedIn, and text your project manager through WhatsApp.\n\nYour workplace is scattered, but it seems to work. Until it doesn't.\n\nYou have long email threads with the designer; they can't understand the red circles on your email attachments because the comments don't align with the circles. Your copywriter also shuffles between email threads and LinkedIn chats to find important details about the project.\n\nTo add to this chaos, your project manager struggles to stay on top of everything. Clearly, your process isn't efficient.\n\nMany agencies collaborating with remote teams experience this, and even with the best team, you can still struggle without the best virtual collaboration tools and strategies.\n\nIn this guide, I'll share strategies and tools that'll make virtual collaboration easier for your creative team in 2025. You'll also learn how to work better with your team and oversee day-to-day affairs without the chaos.\n\nWhat is Virtual Collaboration?\n\nVirtual collaboration is the process of working with team members or contractors in different locations. This means using digital tools and platforms to communicate, share files, and manage tasks and team members from different locations without any friction.\n\nWith the right tools, your team can:\n\nStay connected through instant messaging and video calls.\n\nShare files and resources on cloud-based platforms.\n\nTrack project statuses and deadlines with project management software.\n\nBrainstorm and collaborate easily on communication platforms\n\nAutomate repetitive tasks.\n\nBenefits of Virtual Collaboration\n\nAccording to Filestage, three-quarters of creative collaboration happens remotely. Of course, all freelancers (46.6% of the workforce) work remotely, and if your agency is like 62% of agencies who hire freelancers to get results faster, you don't have a complete team of full-time hires. So, what are the benefits of virtual collaboration?\n\nIt saves cost.\n\nCollaborating through online platforms saves costs on expenses like office spaces and utilities.\n\nAutomattic, the parent company behind WordPress, has 1,722 employees in 91 countries, speaking 115 different languages, and yet the company is worth nearly $7.5 billion.\n\nMatt Mullenweg, the company's CEO, has mentioned severally that remote work has helped the company find impressive talents all over the world.\n\nSaving costs on building an office-based company has helped them focus on more important things, like employee retention programs to improve their productivity levels.\n\nYour team members are more productive.\n\nVirtual collaboration gives your employees a chance to be comfortable at their work. In fact, studies have found that teams that worked remotely were more productive at their work, than in-house teams.\n\nMicrosoft, for instance, uses Microsoft Teams, as a hub for modern collaboration to speed up employee productivity and communication. Effective collaboration helps your team members build on their skills better to improve the quality of their services at the comfort of their home or office spaces.\n\nIt increases your team's flexibility\n\nRemote collaboration gives your team members the flexibility to work during their productive hours.\n\nTools and platforms that support asynchronous meetings make it easy for every member to brainstorm and get feedback from other members and you.\n\nYou have access to a global talent pool.\n\nCommunicating virtually removes geographical barriers— this is why Automattic has over 1700 employees in 91 countries. It's easy to scout and hire talented professionals when you can access them across the world.\n\nSharing documents is easier.\n\nMany virtual collaboration tools are cloud-based. This means everyone on your team can access the latest version of a file, work on it— the file updates as they work on it—and share it with other members.\n\nYou can track tasks better:\n\nYour team can track what needs to be done, who's doing it, and when it's due with a collaboration tool.\n\nFor context, with project management software like ManyRequests, you can assign specific tasks to your team, set deadlines for each task, and you can track each major step with task status.\n\nKey Elements of Successful Virtual Collaboration\n\nSeveral factors go into managing remote teams, and some of these elements include:\n\nMotivating your team members\n\nCommunicating with them\n\nTrusting them as much as you want them to trust you.\n\nGiving them autonomy over decisions— if they're capable, which they should be.\n\nEncouraging them to collaborate with other teammates.\n\nBut most of these factors are nearly impossible to do without the proper tools.\n\nThese are 4 virtual collaboration tools you can use to improve your team's productivity:\n\n1. Project Management Tool\n\nManyRequests\n\nManyRequests is an organized project management software and client portal to communicate with clients, assign and track projects with your teams, and manage edit requests.\n\nWith ManyRequests, you can track which team member was assigned which tasks and set priority levels for when your team is handling more than one project for a particular client.\n\nYou can also follow the status of the project as your team member progresses with it.\n\nOnce a team member turns in a task, you can submit tasks to your clients in Messaging. Or add them to the task box itself although you can customize what they see.\n\nThe client can leave feedback on your work, depending on the services you offer, and you can update your team on changes— all in one platform.\n\n2. Asana\n\nAsana is a project management software to plan, track, and manage agency projects efficiently.\n\nAsana aims to minimize project errors by 90% through better time tracking and communication. On the platform, you can create tasks, set deadlines, and assign responsibilities to your teams. Asana does this through various views like lists, boards, and timelines to visualize projects and their progress.\n\n3. Trello\n\nTrello is a visual project management tool that uses a simple “boards, lists, and cards” system to help teams organize tasks and track progress.\n\nSome key features of Trello include:\n\nBoards, lists, and cards to break down complex projects into smaller tasks. Each Trello card can include task details, attachments, and due dates.\n\nCollaboration tools: Trello allows each team member to comment on cards, tag each other, and attach files to documents. Your team members can also subscribe to cards and receive notifications when another member or you make a change to the document.\n\nTrello's Drag & Drop interface makes it easy to move one task from one list to another.\n\n2. Design Collaboration Tools\n\n1. Figma\n\nFigma is a web-based design tool that helps teams collaborate on interface design projects in real-time.\n\nIts cloud-based platform allows multiple users to work on the same design file at the same time. Your design team can co-edit and comment on designs asynchronously. They can also tag their teammates directly within designs to see to feedback immediately.\n\n2. Canva\n\nCanva is a design tool for handling every visual content, including social media graphics for your clients, presentations, and banners. With Canva, your team members can share, edit, and approve designs from one central place.\n\nCanva also offers real time feedback. Team members can leave comments or reactions directly on the designs. It improves the review process without the back-and-forth emails.\n\n3. ManyRequests\n\nIf you're using ManyRequests, the platform has an integrated design feedback system that allows clients to annotate specific areas of a design.\n\nThey can number areas that need to be reviewed on a design and leave comments/feedback on them.\n\nHere's an example from this article on Design annotation tools:\n\nThe client, in this example, has left some iterations on the design and content. The first arrow shows the details of the iteration, and the second shows the client's first three comments.\n\nOn the right, there's information on who the request is assigned to, its status and priority, and the deadline.\n\nIf you click on the “page load speed” comment, the ManyRequests design annotation feature takes you to the design document and the specific comments for each numbered area.\n\nIt looks like this:\n\nManyRequests markup feature helps you organize every design feedback so you can avoid messy email threads that confuse designers on your team.\n\n3. Communication Tools\n\n1. Slack\n\nSlack is a team collaboration platform for team members to communicate, share updates, and reduce the need for emails.\n\nYou can create Slack channels based on specific topics and projects. For context, you can set up channels like #design, #marketing, or #client-feedback.\n\nOn these channels, you can invite your team members to discuss everything related to the channel.\n\nIt looks like this:\n\nYou can have quick, private conversations and share files with each member through direct messaging.\n\nYou can also integrate your ManyRequests platform with Slack. ManyRequests uses webhooks to communicate with other applications when specific events pop up.\n\nYou can set up your webhooks through Make to send notifications to Slack based on events in ManyRequests, like new requests batch from a client or a new client creation.\n\n📌 Read more on how to integrate ManyRequests with Slack here.\n\n2. ManyRequests\n\nManyRequests offers direct messaging between your clients and team members.\n\nUnlike most management tools, ManyRequests has a dedicated client portal.\n\nThis client-facing feature allows your clients to log in to the portal, submit new requests, and give feedback on previous requests.\n\nYou can then create a task based on these requests and assign them to your team members on the same platform. ManyRequests also allows you to track tasks for each client project you assign.\n\nOther communication tools you can use include:\n\nLoom: A video recording tool ideal for creating outreach videos and sharing feedback easily.\n\nMicrosoft Teams: It combines chat, video calls, and file sharing and integrates with Microsoft 365 applications.\n\n4. Asset Management Tools\n\nSome asset management tools your agency can use are:\n\nWiden Collective: Has a comprehensive feature for organizing, storing, and distributing digital assets.\n\nCanto: Has a user-friendly interface to organize and share digital assets and improve team collaboration.\n\nManyRequests also has a digital asset storage to store design files, marketing assets, and other digital content in one location. If your team member or client needs to access any of these assets, they can find them in the ManyRequests Storage section.\n\nBest Practices for Virtual Creative Collaboration\n\nVirtual collaboration is unavoidable in creative agencies, and here are six best practices for virtual collaboration in creative agencies:\n\n1. Have a Specific Workflow\n\nYour workflow is the roadmap your team follows to get a project from concept to completion.\n\nIt's a structure that keeps every member aligned on what to expect, who's responsible for which task, and each milestone in the project.\n\nWhen every member knows the steps involved and their roles, it reduces the constant back-and-forth messages and questions they may have. It also:\n\nCreates a predictable workflow. Team members can plan their lives around your agency's processes and be available when they are needed.\n\nReduces information overload. Your employees are less likely to overload themselves with updates or requests when they can look at the process outline.\n\nBuilds trust. Defining your agency's processes shows team members you trust them to handle their part. They know what needs to be done and when it should be done, so communication is more natural.\n\n2. Check In With Your Teammates Regularly\n\nCheck in with your teammates to ask about progress updates and their general well-being.\n\nThe goal is to make them feel valued and important to your agency. Don't be stiff when you reach out to them; add some casual conversations to break the walls that virtual environments can sometimes create.\n\n🔥 Tip: Ask them about their weekend, talk about yours, and share some personal updates— if you just welcomed a baby to your family, for example, or how your vacation went.\n\nIt makes the conversations more natural, and over time, your team feels comfortable enough to share their ideas with you.\n\n3. Hire the Right Team Members\n\nEven with the best collaboration tools and strategies, you may find it difficult to collaborate virtually if you have the wrong team.\n\nHiring the right team doesn't only mean hiring professionals; your team members should be able to handle remote work.\n\nThis means they should\n\nBe able to adapt to project changes.\n\nBe able to motivate themselves to do their jobs efficiently.\n\nBe able to communicate well with their teammates.\n\nYour team members must be capable of taking ownership of their work, reach out when they have challenges, and contribute positively to the team's morale.\n\nSome tips for hiring a team like this include:\n\nCheck how they respond during the hiring process. Observe their email exchanges and how they speak on video calls— it'll give you insights into how well they can articulate their ideas.\n\nAsk about projects they worked on independently in the past. Strong candidates will share specific examples showing they set and met goals on their own.\n\nAsk if they ever took ownership of a project. Candidates who accept responsibility, even when things go off track, are dependable.\n\nCheck how well they work with a team. You can provide a paid task where they'll need to communicate with the team to see how well they can collaborate.\n\n4. Don't Over-Communicate\n\nCommunication is important, but over-communicating can be counterproductive.\n\nConstant messages or check-ins could show that you don't trust them to do their job, or worse, they may feel micromanaged.\n\nInstead, clarify what level of communication you expect from them on each task and encourage them to reach out only when they have updates, questions, or need support.\n\nThis respects their autonomy to work efficiently without jeopardizing the collaborative environment.\n\n5. Consider Time Zones When Assigning Tasks and Setting Deadlines\n\nAssign tasks with buffer times to ensure deadlines accommodate everyone's working hours. You can create a shared calendar that shows everyone's time zones and availability to help you manage time zones efficiently.\n\n6. Centralize Your Team’s Content\n\nBring all important project information—like files, conversations, and tasks—into one main platform that everyone on the team can access.\n\nRemote teams can't walk over to ask questions, so it's important to have all this information in one place.\n\nIt helps your team find everything they need without going through multiple apps. A tool like ManyRequests makes this easy.\n\nManyRequests offers a centralized platform to help you manage client requests, documents, and communication in one place. Your team can keep track of everything that way, from task progress to client conversations.\n\nReal-World Examples of Virtual Collaboration in an Agency\n\nVirtual collaboration has saved several creative agencies from the chaos that comes with managing a remote team. Here are some real-world examples from our customers:\n\nDarkRoast, a Canadian graphic design service, had a team of 30 designers managing multiple small, medium, and large design requests.\n\nThey needed an organized system where their clients could submit detailed briefs, they could assign it to their designers and still be able to prioritize tasks.\n\nWith ManyRequests, the agency was able to track all tasks in real-time. They also had their designers in one place, which made it easy for collaboration.\n\nTrevor Pare, founder of DarkRoast, says\n\n“One thing we love about ManyRequests is the Loom integration. Our team members and clients can quickly send their feedback without leaving the app”.\n\nDarkRoast isn't the only agency that needed virtual collaboration made easy.\n\nProntto, a 3D digital visualization and technical drawing agency, had challenges with managing their team alongside their clients. They needed to;\n\nonboard and bill their clients,\n\ncollect and keep client information for architectural projects,\n\ntrack projects, revisions, and deliver on time.\n\nAnd they wanted all this on one platform. With ManyRequests, Prontto has every project process on one platform. They can onboard their clients, get project briefs from them, assign these briefs to their architects, and track the task progression. Their clients also have access to their invoices, files, and team members.\n\nTheir agency director left this review:\n\nConclusion\n\nCollaborating with your team virtually means managing day-to-day operation in an easier way. This includes how you work with your clients and your team members. The only way to do these efficiently is by making it easy to reach and track every team member and task.\n\nWe've discussed the strategies and necessary tools, like ManyRequests, that can help you make the best of virtual collaboration. You can sign up for a 14-day free trial to see how ManyRequests can help manage your clients and agency operations more efficiently.\n\nFAQs\n\n1. What KPI can I use to measure collaboration successfully?\n\nSome of the KPIs you can measure are project completion rate (are your team slow, unmotivated, or disorganized?), customer satisfaction, and revenue generated from projects your team worked on.\n\n2. How can I improve communication for my remote team without overwhelming them?\n\nUse dedicated channels for specific topics so your team members only see relevant updates. Check in on them, but keep it brief. You should also encourage them to reach out if they need to ask questions.\n\n3. What tools can help manage feedback on design projects remotely?\n\nUse tools like Figma, ManyRequests annotation feature, and Canva to manage design feedback. Your clients and team members can comment directly on specific parts of the design. For video feedback, you can record comments with Loom.\n\n‍",

Some users miss advanced project management features, and others would prefer automated time tracking over a timer-based one.\n\nIf you’re looking for an Everhour alternative, we’ve examined eleven better options.\n\nThe 11 best Everhour alternatives\n\nToggl Track\n\nToggl Track is an all-in-one time management tool marrying ease of use with reporting depth and flexibility in use cases. Our goal is to provide reliable insights into work styles, performance blockers, and productivity boosters.\n\nEverhour only offers a clock-in and clock-out experience for employee timekeeping.

With over a hundred pre-made integrations, you can bring time-tracking to all major digital workplace apps.\n\nIf you didn’t see the right logo, use our well-documented application programming interface (API) to embed Toggl Track features into other apps. Everhour only has about 40 integrations, and its API has been in beta since 2020.\n\nEverhour limits employee time tracking to timesheets, while Toggl Track offers more in-depth data analytics. Use different dashboard views to calculate payroll, track project profitability, issue client invoices, and compare task performance. Visualize productivity trends to discover new profitability opportunities.\n\n⭐ G2: 4.6 from 1,500+ reviews, Capterra: 4.7 from 2,000+ reviews\n\nStandout features\n\nManual and automated time-tracking online and offline\n\nInstant sync across devices for high data accuracy\n\nProject time tracking to estimate revenue and manage profitability\n\nEditable online timesheets for payroll management\n\nCustom dashboards and report views\n\nIntegrations\n\nOver 100 integrations to track time inside popular project management software (Jira, Basecamp, Trello, etc), communication apps (Slack, Outlook, Gmail), sales, marketing, accounting, and IT platforms.

Power up the live time or add entries manually for offline work. Harvest accurately detects idle time. The time-tracker will auto-stop after 10 minutes of inactivity (no mouse movements or keystrokes).\n\nHarvest combines budget and progress tracking to improve project management. It makes project-critical information available to stakeholders, helping to keep projects within budget and profitable. The reporting dashboard shows all tracked billable hours, total and remaining budgets, internal costs (expenses), and uninvoiced amounts.\n\nYou can also burrow deeper into the Reporting tab to review team members’ entries. Analyze team’s work habits, detect overworked or under-utilized staff, and compare actual hours vs initial estimates for project management. However, Harvest lacks attendance tracking features (which Everhour has).\n\nBut there’s a simple workaround: create separate tasks for different non-billable hours like vacations, PTO, and business travel to track these alongside billable hours for better resource management.\n\n⭐ G2: 4.3 from 807 reviews, Capterra: 4.6 from 605 reviews\n\nStandout features\n\nManually activated time tracker for desktop, web, and mobile\n\nStreamlined workflow for client billing and invoicing\n\nIntuitive expense tracking for client reimbursements\n\nSAML-based SSO for secure team log-in\n\nCreate time reports with custom filters\n\nIntegrations\n\nOver 60 different integrations with popular project management apps (ClickUp, monday.com, Asana, etc), workflow automation tools (Zapier, IFTTT), and other business apps.\n\nPricing\n\nWhat users are saying\n\n“Synchronization between platforms is flawless,” says Diana Moreno, Project Manager at Ogilvy. “Time entries entered using the browser are immediately reflected in both the mobile and desktop versions.”\n\nFreelance SEO Consultant Shannon also admires the app’s UX. “The interface makes it dead simple to task-switch and start logging hours for a different client. And when it’s time to assess how many hours are left to spend on a client, the analytics reporting is easy to understand and offers several great ways to manipulate the data.”\n\nHarvest vs. Everhour\n\n📚 Check out more Harvest alternatives.\n\nTimeCamp\n\nTimeCamp meshes employee attendance tracking with profitability tracking tools. Your team can log work hours manually or automatically using web, desktop, and mobile apps. All the insights are aggregated on a personal activity timeline alongside activity screenshots (if activated).\n\nUnlike Everhour, TimeCamp also offers GPS-based real-time time tracking with its mobile app. Once the contractor enters a geofenced job site, the timer will start and assign a time entry to the corresponding task.\n\nYou can simultaneously track people at multiple sites to optimize shift scheduling and team dispatches. The Time Clock Kiosk feature lets you set a stationary tracker for monitoring employee attendance for payroll processing, an alternative to paper punch cards or expensive digital systems.\n\nOn the billing side, you can auto-log billable hours (based on team rates), monitor labor costs, and create customer invoices. And you’ll receive an immediate notification if your project risks exceeding the budget or timeline.\n\n⭐ G2: 4.7 from 334 reviews, Capterra: 4.7 from 598 reviews\n\nStandout features\n\nDaily and weekly timesheet generation with approvals\n\nOvertime and idle time detection\n\nOffsite time tracking with geo-fencing features\n\nEmployee attendance monitoring with a kiosk app\n\nBudget planning and tracking against billable rates\n\nIntegrations\n\nAuto-sync projects and tasks from 26 popular tools (Asana, Microsoft Teams, Notion, monday.com, etc). Auto-log time from 80+ websites. Add custom integrations using available API.\n\nPricing\n\nWhat users are saying\n\nPeople rave about TimeCamp’s usability. “The interface of TC is easy to grasp, so there isn’t time wasted figuring out how to log my time. Even when the application or site is updated with new features or a new look, you can get to where you want to go very quickly again,” says Ivan Wiehahn, an IT Consultant.\n\nVideo editor Germans Relinsh is also sold on various automations. “It has a lot of useful features, such as an automatic project tracker, task widget, weekly timesheets, and progress reports. And it’s so very convenient to use. I simply installed it on my PC, and it tracks my activity every day.”\n\nTimeCamp vs. Everhour\n\n📚 Learn more about other TimeCamp alternatives.\n\nHubstaff\n\nHubstaff offers workforce management tools for attendance tracking, employee scheduling, billing, and payroll management. Similar to Everhour and TimeCamp, it includes features for monitoring employee activity. Screenshots, URL tracking, and device activity rates are logged during active time tracking. Users can delete or blur screenshots to avoid storing sensitive corporate data online (which may breach security policies).\n\nTime logging is manual or automatic with a Chrome-only extension or installed app. Mobile users can auto-report hours using a GPS tracker with geofencing. Offline tracking syncs entries once you’re connected. You can configure per-user timekeeping settings, lock time entries to avoid manual changes, and automate timesheet approvals.\n\nLike Toggl Track, Hubstaff provides in-depth reporting. Choose from 20 pre-made time report templates or create custom views. Optimize task management with insights into teams’ average completion time. Identify chores that take up the most effort and bring the least returns by comparing billable rates. Build better employee schedules with real-time visibility into workers’ availability, location, PTO, and holidays.\n\n⭐ G2: 4.5 from 1200+ reviews, Capterra: 4.6 from 1500+ reviews\n\nStandout features\n\nSimple time tracking across tasks, projects, and job sites\n\nAutomatic timesheet approvals based on custom rules\n\nTimeline reports highlight bottlenecks and identify trends and work habits.\n\nProductivity analysis that helps with workflow optimization.\n\nGamification functionality to celebrate top performers\n\nIntegrations\n\nOffers 30+ different integrations with apps like Basecamp, Trello, Slack, Quickbooks Online, PayPal, and Asana.\n\nPricing\n\nWhat users are saying\n\nThe time tracking feature is incredibly precise and easy to use, which has helped us manage our tasks and projects more efficiently. The detailed reports and real-time insights provided by Hubstaff have been a game changer for optimizing performance,” shared Zuhair Thabit, CEO of CrypSol Technologies.\n\nMany users also praise Hubstaff’s customer support. “Whenever there is any sort of issue, the customer support is super supportive and very prompt. They literally fix issues within 1 hour,” said Manideepa Purkait, a small business owner.\n\nHubstaff vs. Everhour\n\n📚 Read more about other Hubstaff alternatives.\n\nClockify\n\nClockify packs a punch with comprehensive time-based scheduling features — timer apps, timesheets, task progress, resource availability, and planned hours. It’s available on Windows, Mac, and Linux (desktop) and iOS and Android (mobile).\n\nClockify lets you assign logs to clients or projects, schedule time-bound assignments, and track attendance and PTO. Scheduled work entries can be viewed on a project timeline to understand who’s working on what, when, and for how long.\n\nYou can also track team availability and resource utilization in another dashboard. Build custom team schedules, set project milestones, and monitor revenues and costs for planned activities.\n\n⭐ G2: 4.5 from 170+ reviews, Capterra: 4.8 from 9000+ reviews\n\nStandout features\n\nDigital timesheets with automatic time logging\n\nPersonal calendar view for time-blocking\n\nPer-user work activity breakdowns\n\nMulti-view reports for teams and projects\n\nProject performance forecasts\n\nIntegrations\n\nOver 30 integrations with popular project management and productivity apps, including Jira, Asana, GitHub, HelpScout, Zendesk, and HubSpot.\n\nPricing\n\nWhat users are saying\n\n“Clockify’s UI is simple and clear, and it’s easy to find anything you need. If you need help, the resources are easy to use. The cost for us was important, and we found Clockify to be really good value for our money,” says Jeff Kayton, an Operations professional.\n\nGraphic designer Victoria also enjoys the Gantt charts for time management. “Colour-coded projects, the ability to add as many different projects as you need to, adding new clients, checking out your reports, and analyzing how you spent your time while working easily [are major pros].”\n\nClockify vs. Everhour\n\n📚 Discover more Clockify alternatives.\n\nTime Doctor\n\nTime Doctor provides in-depth time insights for remote, office, and on-site workers. You get a slew of analytics views showcasing productivity KPIs like productive and unproductive time, web and app usage, and daily timelines.\n\nThe tracker can run in silent mode (i.e., fully automatically with employees’ consent) and capture all device activity, including screenshots, inactivity periods, breaks, suspicious actions, and video screen recordings. Note of caution: such monitoring may border on employee surveillance, promoting unhealthy management habits.\n\nWhen used responsibly, Time Doctor can be a great tool for identifying organizational inefficiencies, time-wasting activities (like too frequent meetings), and missing work-life balance. The app delivers users and managers a good dose of insights into their productivity trends.\n\nUnlike Everhour and Harvest, Time Doctor doesn’t offer billing and client invoicing features. However, there’s a basic payroll management tracker for estimating compensation based on attendance.\n\n⭐ G2: 4.4 from 380+ reviews, Capterra: 4.5 from 500+ reviews\n\nStandout features\n\nAutomatic time and attendance tracking with offline mode\n\nEmployee activity monitoring includes screenshots, video recording, and app activity tracking\n\nDaily workers’ activity summaries with the benchmarks and best practices for improvement\n\nWork-life balance metrics to prevent burnout and turnover\n\nCustom data exports for sorting time-tracking data beyond the retention period\n\nIntegrations\n\nOver 50 integrations with business apps like Trello, Wrike, Pluto, Salesforce, Microsoft 365 and more.\n\nPricing\n\nWhat users are saying\n\n“Time Doctor gives us an overview of the whole CS operations in terms of agent performance, be it productivity, attendance, idle time, and productive hours,” shared John Epok Pascual, Regional Platforms Lead at Circles.Life.\n\nAlicia, a CEO at a Law Practice, also loves how “Time Doctor allows me to make sure my employees are working and billing their time without me being a nag.”\n\nTime Doctor vs. Everhour\n\nTimely\n\nTimely automates time tracking more than Everhour. You can set most logging on auto-pilot with Memory Tracker (manual time adding and bulk editing are available, too) and use AI for automatic timesheet generation.\n\nThe app’s algo will match entries with projects and clients in your workspace. The accuracy is about 80%-90%. From meetings and emails to coding and design work, Timely’s Memory tracker remembers everything you’ve worked on throughout your day.\n\nSimilar to Toggl Track, Timely prioritizes anti-surveillance, so there aren’t any direct employee monitoring features like screenshots or activity logging. But the app auto-detects idle time, so you don’t need to log off. For the manual tracker, you’ll get an email nudge to stop it.\n\nThe project management dashboard provides a detailed view of team activity and financial metrics. You can track billable rates, internal costs, and set budget limits. For greater clarity, you can also add required tags and notes for all entries. Use the same few to assign work to others and review team capacity to avoid overbookings.\n\n⭐ G2: 4.8 from 400+ reviews, Capterra: 4.7 from 700+ reviews\n\nStandout features\n\nMemory tracking across multiple products with automatic entry categorization\n\nMulti-currency billable rates and internal project cost trackers\n\nTeam dashboard with group and individual capacity insights\n\nSeamless report sharing via private URLs or downloadable files\n\nOptional location tracking via Android and iOS apps\n\nIntegrations\n\nOver 30 integrations for memory tracking in apps like Adobe, Airtable, Asana, Figma, GitLab, and more.\n\nPricing\n\nWhat users are saying\n\n“I’ve been using Timely for about eight years now. It integrates with all my tools. I do contract work and am constantly multi-tasking and switching between projects. It is tough for me to fully track the exact hours that are needed. With Timely, the time tracking is quick and clean. I love too that I can go back in time and review all my past time entries for better invoicing to the client,” raves Rosangela Manfredo, Marketing Operations Manager at Applied Visions, Inc.\n\nLaurence Collings and other users also love the product’s simplicity. “Zero learning curve, just install, and it tracks in the background. Saves me a huge mental effort and time trying to track back what I’ve done across multiple projects to enter manually into previous apps I used. I can go back weeks later and see exactly what files I was working on and assign to projects easily.”\n\nTimely vs. Everhour\n\n📚 Learn about other Timely alternatives.\n\nRescueTime\n\nRescueTime is a personal time-tracking app that helps you stay focused on work. Once installed, it tracks all your desktop and mobile activity in the background and provides a summary of app usage. You can manually turn tracking on and off or program the app to launch only on your workdays.\n\nRescueTime helps eliminate distractions by blocking ‘unproductive apps’ (your choice!) during your Focus Session. This product trains you to maintain a longer focus and prioritize deep work over ‘busy work’ like meetings, emails, or casual browsing.\n\nThe reporting dashboard provides ample insights into your daily activity. You can edit or delete entries and organize them into sub-categories. Or, try setting productivity Goals — a commitment to doing three Focused Sessions per week or spending less than four hours on Instagram. RescueTime will monitor your progress and send alerts when you hit or miss your goals.\n\n⭐ G2: 4.1 from 90+ reviews, Capterra: 4.6 from 160+ reviews\n\nStandout features\n\nAutomated time-tracking in the background\n\nDistraction blocking and alerts to stay focused\n\nTimesheets AI automatically assigns time to projects or clients\n\nExportable daily/weekly/monthly activity reports\n\nDetailed reports on productivity trends\n\nIntegrations\n\nHas 10 pre-made integrations with messenger, calendar, and data analytics services. You can also use Zapier and IFTTT to create ones.\n\nPricing\n\nWhat users are saying\n\nUniversity professor Sebastian is a fan of RescueTime, as it “tracks what you work on completely automatically, reliably records all applications used, and gives automatic ratings of how ‘productive’ certain applications are.”\n\nClinical Director Sam Kordik also appreciates the intuitive experience. “By far, the best part of RescueTime is how streamlined and easy it is to use. Painless. Install it, install the browser extensions, and then it runs quietly in the background, tracking and capturing data.”\n\nRescueTime vs. Everhour\n\nDeskTime\n\nDeskTime is a time-tracking platform with employee monitoring and performance evaluation features. It provides a summary of accessed URLs, apps, documents, and idle time. Activity screenshots are also available.\n\nThe Private Time feature lets employees pause all time-tracking activities. All aggregated data is quantified on the Productivity dashboard as a percentage-based calculation of effectiveness and productivity.\n\nIn addition, DeskTime allows assigning shifts, viewing absences, and tracking activity across tasks. You can integrate tasks from supported project management apps, add hourly rates, descriptions, and assign tracked time. You can also generate daily, weekly, and monthly reports on your team’s results.\n\nReal-time dashboards provide a bird-eye view of everyone’s activity levels, logged time, and project progress. Based on this data, you can set your team’s specific productivity or other goals.\n\n⭐ G2: 4.5 from 300+ reviews, Capterra: 4.6 from 500+reviews\n\nStandout features\n\nAutomatic time capture of visited apps, URLs, and documents\n\nWorker productivity and effectiveness calculations\n\nSeamless shift scheduling for optimal resource usage\n\nTeam dashboards with availability statuses and active projects\n\nShared absence calendar\n\nIntegrations\n\nNative integrations include Trello, Gitlab, Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar, Jira, Basecamp, and Asana. You can also create extra ones with Zapier.\n\nPricing\n\nWhat users are saying\n\n“I love how easy it is for employees to see their own hours and what they are doing at the time. It is very clear to managers to see what their employees have been doing and how productive they are,” says Brian, a Systems Administrator.\n\n“DeskTime is incredibly easy to use, with very little fanfare. It’s simple to assign apps to productive and non-productive ones. I love especially that DeskTime even shows the time on what project I’m working on, and not just the name of the software”, echoes Natasha, a Digital Marketing Coordinator.\n\nDeskTime vs. Everhour\n\n📚 Read about other DeskTime alternatives.\n\nTMetric\n\nSimilar to Evernote, TMetric links time tracking and project management for better resource management. Users can automatically link tasks to timer-tracked entries, add time manually, log offline time, and see their schedule on a visual timeline. Admins also enable or disable manual time entries and add mandatory fields for data consistency.\n\nA major plus is you can track unlimited clients and projects (even on a free plan) — a great feature for agencies or larger service providers. Assign unique billing rates for different work types, projects, or team members to gain reliable budgeting and profitability data. Easily duplicate budgets across standard projects and receive email alerts when you’re about to hit the spending threshold.\n\nOn the reporting side, TMetric offers multiple filter views to analyze time, task, and project data. The Business plan includes user activity reports with aggregated stats for teams’ most-used apps and websites.\n\n⭐ G2: 4.6 from 100+ reviews, Capterra: 4.5 from 250+ reviews\n\nStandout features\n\nTimer-based time tracking with idle time detection and screenshot capture\n\nLink time entries to external tasks in project management tools\n\nAttendance and absence management\n\nInvoice generation, based on tracked billable hours\n\nPersonalized team workspaces with detailed reports\n\nIntegrations\n\n60+ integrations with apps like Assembla, Zoho, Bitbucket, Coda, Figma, and more.\n\nPricing\n\nWhat users are saying\n\n“What I like most is its simplified yet detailed reports on a chosen time period. You can actually enumerate the different tasks you have worked on within your preferred timeline(hour/day/week/year). You can also choose how your summary reports will be shown—will it be by projects, by tasks, by team, or by whole,” says Renelene Jay, a lead generation specialist.\n\n“TMetric is simple. Since I’m the admin in the workspace, I had to configure the settings, and now I’m the one who manages the account, and it’s really easy. Also, the support team is friendly and eager to assist anytime,” adds Marie Sharapa, Head Of Communication at OWOX BI.\n\nTMetric vs. Everhour\n\nPaymo\n\nPaymo is a feature-rich Everhour alternative. It combines key project management features, an in-app time tracker, file management, resource management, and financial functionality. But without the steep learning curve of complex (and expensive!) workforce management tools.\n\nA built-in timer logs hours spent across clients, projects, and tasks, giving managers a full view of employee workloads and availability. But it only works for internal entries. If you’re using a third-party task management app, Paymo’s time tracker won’t work. But it does automatically log other desktop activity and link it to respective tasks.\n\nFor project management, you can switch between Kanban Boards and Gantt Chart views. You can also build critical path charts to map task dependencies and add overlapping or buffer days between two dependent tasks for optimized scheduling.\n\nBased on time and task data, Paymo provides a real-time resource load chart with estimates for bookable hours for each team member. On a separate dashboard, you get financial insights about the projects’ health in terms of budget and on-time execution. Budgets can be built with fixed-price and hourly rates, input on a user- or project-level. Users can add expenses to all projects.\n\nAll project information can be converted into an estimate and shared with clients. You can create multi-language, one-time, or recurring invoices and accept payments via PayPal, Stripe, or Authorize.net.\n\n⭐ G2: 4.6 from 500+ reviews, Capterra: 4.7 from 600+ reviews\n\nStandout features\n\nIn-app task management with multi-user assigning\n\nMobile, desktop, and web app-based time tracking\n\nCustomizable project templates with Gantt charts and critical path views\n\nResource calendar with real-time view of the workloads and availability\n\nConvenient file manager with proofing and versioning\n\nIntegrations\n\nPaymo integrates with 14 third-party apps, including Slack, Typeform, QuickBooks, and Shift, among others. For extras, you can use Zapier or Pabbly.\n\nPricing\n\nWhat users are saying\n\n“I like the way Paymo has been designed. With its straightforward menu sidebar, it’s easy to access everything your business needs quickly and easily. From adding users or managing subscriptions at the click of a button to creating tasks in the ‘Project’ tab for members within my organization or working with accounting by invoicing expenses, inputting estimates, and making one-off payments, I no longer have any problems keeping track of finances,” says Jamie Lee Jahn, Sales Manager at CaliforniaRetail Data Systems.\n\nSmall business owner Dan Anderson also loves Paymo’s versatility. “We use it to track clients and projects and for all our time tracking. We have both fixed-rate and hourly projects. We can track both and view our performance either way. It manages teams well, so I can see what other users are doing. The interface is clean and efficient. It is easy to create and save various reports which I run regularly.”\n\nPaymo vs. Everhour\n\nHow we chose this list of Everhour alternatives\n\nToggl’s Editorial and Product teams regularly collaborate to test, vet, and evaluate dozens of time management apps to guide our product growth strategy.\n\nOur reviews are based on internal comparison tables assessing each product’s features, strengths, and missing capabilities. We evaluate each tool against 10 to 20 attributes like time tracking accuracy, ease of use, native integrations, pricing, scalability, etc. Internal spreadsheets helped us shortlist the above Everhour alternatives.\n\nTo provide accurate reviews, we also trialed the tools across several teams for different use cases and analyzed public user sentiment to avoid internal biases.\n\nWhy do users switch from Everhour?\n\nEverhour helps you track time spent on tasks to improve your project management, resource management, budgeting, and invoicing process.\n\nIt has a low learning curve and covers the basics for smaller organizations — providing visibility into teams’ capacities and workflows. But it lacks the seamless automatic time-tracking experience and reporting depth of similarly-priced time tracking apps.\n\n“With Everhour, you need to stay on the page of the project you’re working on or make sure you remember to stop the timer if you’re doing something else. This can be problematic, sometimes you might be doing something like using a CRM that is updating plugins or something for the job, but it won’t track that time on that page,” noted Timothy Beukman, a freelance web designer. “So you need to make sure your time is correct in the end. Toggl Track is another tool that seems to do the page swapping better and keep tracking the time.”\n\nUsers also have issues with Everhour integrations, which often fail to capture data as advertised. Many reported syncing problems between Everhour budget data and Asana tasks, and logging hours in a desktop app. Others complained about disappearing Everhour timers from Asana dashboards. ClickUp integrations disconnect frequently, according to another reviewer.\n\nWhat to look for in an Everhour alternative\n\nChoosing the right Everhour alternative depends on your specific needs. But generally, you should consider the following criteria when choosing an Everhour alternative:\n\nAdvanced time-tracking. Timer-based logging requires manual effort and may lead to forgotten hours. Other tools allow users to choose between fully automatic, start/stop time, manual, and offline time entry.\n\nBillable rates customization. Everhour only supports hourly rates and lets you mark entries as billable/non-billable. Also, you can’t have different currencies in your Team account, which is a big limitation for international companies.\n\nProductivity analytics. Everhour only provides data on team capacity, project progression, and billing. But it doesn’t indicate how well your teams manage their time. Look for alternatives with more detailed activity reports and extra features for promoting productivity and accountability.\n\nScalability. Also, look for a time and activity tracking tool that can scale with your business. It should seamlessly integrate with a wider range of business systems, workflows, and time management strategies.\n\nStart with a free time tracking tool\n\nIf Everhour isn’t a match for your business, you have many great alternatives to try.\n\nToggl Track offers full product functionality, unlike other Everhour alternatives. Seamlessly track time across 100+ business apps using our browser extension, web, desktop, or mobile app without worrying about privacy.\n\nOur tool measures your actual output instead of just logging time spent in ‘unproductive apps’ or staring at the same document. Customizable reports show where your people’s focus lingers and which tasks need the most hours but bring the least revenue. Analytics provide deeper insights into capacity, resources, and billing.",
      "# [10 Best Finance Tools for Creative Agencies (2024)](https://www.manyrequests.com/blog/finance-tools)\nYour agency outgrew spreadsheets months ago. Now, you waste hours piecing together project budgets, chasing client payments, and struggling to see which projects actually make money.\n\nEvery month brings the same headache: manual invoicing, time tracking gaps, and messy retainer management.\n\nThe solution isn't hiring an accountant or cobbling together five different tools. You need specialized finance software that understands how creative agencies work. Software that automates your billing, shows you profitable projects and onboards retainer clients in one place.\n\nBut here's the challenge: most finance tools focus on general business needs— they ignore specific features like:\n\nProject-based billing and profitability tracking\n\nVariable income from retainers and one-off projects\n\nTeam time tracking that connects to invoices\n\nClient collaboration through a client portal and automated billing\n\nResource planning for creative teams\n\nIn this review, I analyze the client, project, and financial management features of 10 software to help you choose the right tool for your agency.\n\n10 Finance Tools for Your Agency's Everyday Needs\n\nThere are core finance tracking tools that manage payroll and taxes, and there are comprehensive tools that provide client portals alongside their financial management features. Client collaboration is as important as seeing your financial accounts, so I’ve gathered the best tools for these different use cases. Here’s a brief overview:\n\n1. ManyRequests\n\nManyRequests is a client portal software with features to manage tasks, automate invoicing and billing, and communicate with clients and team members. You can create order forms, track requests, and integrate with third-party apps to complete your jobs.\n\nHere are its top three features to handle your financial needs:\n\n1. Client Portal\n\nThe client portal is the central hub to handle all client interactions and payments. Each client receives access to a secure, branded portal where they view their projects, provide feedback through the text box or markup feature for designs, and pay invoices.\n\nIn this screenshot, Jeff has 56 active tasks, and if he needs to speak to the agency urgently, he can book a call right on the portal.\n\nThe client portal eliminates the back-and-forth of email threads and creates a professional work and payment experience. It also keeps a record of all chats, documents, and payment history to maintain client relationships and resolve any payment queries quickly.\n\n2. Project Management\n\nManyRequests organizes projects into clear phases and milestones to help you track deliverables and deadlines. While it doesn't have a task dependencies feature, its simple Requests interface helps you monitor all active tasks.\n\nYou can also use the Reporting feature to filter all tasks to see how profitable they are based on the services clients pay for. The report feature also shows all active team members to assess their capacity for future tasks.\n\nIn short, the task management system helps you see every active task, assignee, and task status in one view.\n\n3. Time Tracking & Automated Billing\n\nManyRequests has a start and stop time-tracking feature that’s directly connected to the billing process to solve one of the biggest headaches in agency finance. You can also use the manual timesheet to enter the billable hours for the task.\n\nYou can create services using a time-based, recurring, or one-off-based model. Either models automatically send invoices to your clients after you submit the deliverable. Your clients can then pay through the Stripe integration embedded in the portal.\n\nThis automation helps you send invoices and receive payments without any administrative effort.\n\nPros:\n\nRemoves the gap between time tracking and invoice creation\n\nOffers a professional client experience through the white-label client-branded portal\n\nManages recurring payments, time-based, and one-off services\n\nProvides clear visibility into project timelines and team capacity\n\nHas a user-friendly interface that creative teams actually want to use\n\nScales smoothly from 5 to 50+ person agencies and multiple clients\n\nCons:\n\nBasic reporting compared to dedicated accounting software\n\nSome advanced automation features are limited to higher-tier plans\n\nMonthly pricing might be high for very small agencies\n\nPricing:\n\nStarter: $99/2 user/m. +$40 for an extra user.\n\nCore: $149/5 user/m. +$40 for an extra user.\n\nPro: $399/10 users/m + $40 for an extra user.\n\nEnterprise: custom pricing includes advanced automation and dedicated account support\n\n2. Bonsai\n\nBonsai is a business and financial management software for freelancers and small creative teams. It has features like contract creation, invoicing, time tracking, and expense management to help you avoid administrative stress. Here are some of its finance tool features:\n\n1. Client Management Portal\n\nBonsai has a client portal where clients can view proposals, sign contracts, and pay invoices through their dashboard. While the portal stores client documents and payment history, it lacks communication features and feedback tools that can help your clients collaborate on projects directly.\n\n📌 Tip: Read this article for client communication strategies for 2025.\n\n2. Project Management System\n\nBonsai’s project management features help you break down work into tasks and milestones. You can create project templates and track basic deadlines, but it offers limited views for resource planning.\n\nThe workflow tools work best for simple projects rather than complex agency campaigns.\n\n3. Time Tracking & Automated Billing\n\nYou can track time against projects and automatically turn tracked hours into invoices. Bonsai also integrates with multiple payment gateways like Stripe and PayPal for automated billing.\n\nHowever, although you can customize invoice templates with your branding, the recurring billing features are basic compared to other finance software.\n\nPros:\n\nStrong contract management features\n\nMultiple payment gateway options\n\nSimple time-tracking interface\n\nEasy invoice customization\n\nCons:\n\nLimited team collaboration tools\n\nBasic project management features\n\nMinimal resource planning features\n\nBetter suited for freelancers than agencies\n\nPricing:\n\nBasic: $15/user/m\n\nEssentials: $25/user/month\n\nPremium: $3//user/month\n\nElite: 59/user/month\n\n3. Harvest\n\nHarvest is a time-tracking, invoicing, and billing software that converts tracked hours into revenue. Some of its finance tool features include:\n\n1. Client Management Portal\n\nYour clients access a basic portal to view and pay invoices. This is where you'll save payment history and past invoices, but the portal lacks project collaboration features. You can't use it for client feedback or approvals, which means you'll need additional tools to communicate with your clients.\n\n2. Project Management System\n\nHarvest focuses purely on time and budget tracking. You can set up projects, assign team members, and monitor hours spent— it doesn't have advanced task management or workflow features. This means you'll need to pair Harvest with a project management tool like Asana or Trello.\n\n📌 Tip: You can also consider these reviewed Asana alternatives.\n\n3. Time Tracking & Automated Billing\n\nTime tracking is where Harvest shines.\n\nYou can log hours against projects through the desktop or mobile interface. The system turns tracked time into detailed invoices automatically and processes payments through Stripe or PayPal. You can also set up retainer tracking to monitor monthly hour allocations.\n\nPros:\n\nPowerful time-tracking features\n\nDetailed time reporting options\n\nEasy expense tracking\n\nSolid integration options\n\nCons:\n\nNo built-in project management feature\n\nBasic client portal features\n\nLimited team collaboration tools\n\nRequires multiple app integrations\n\nPricing:\n\nFree: 1 person, 2 projects\n\nPro: $13.75/user/month - Unlimited projects\n\nPremium: $17.50/user/month\n\n4. FreshBooks\n\nFreshBooks is a cloud accounting platform for service businesses and agencies. Some of its finance tool features include:\n\n1. Client Management Portal\n\nYour clients get a portal focused on financial transactions. They can view invoices, make payments, and access their billing history. The portal includes basic project discussion features but lacks comprehensive feedback and approval systems that help with in-app project collaboration.\n\n2. Project Management System\n\nFreshBooks helps you track time and expenses against projects. You can set project budgets and monitor spending, but have limited task management features. It works better for financial oversight than day-to-day project assigning and task management.\n\n3. Time Tracking & Automated Billing\n\nYou can track billable hours through the desktop or mobile view.\n\nFreshBooks creates automatic invoices from tracked time and supports recurring billing for retainers. You’ll also get standard payment processing through major payment gateways.\n\nPros:\n\nStrong accounting features\n\nDouble-entry bookkeeping\n\nClear financial reporting\n\nGood expense tracking\n\nCons:\n\nLimited project management feature\n\nMinimal team collaboration\n\nAccounting-first approach\n\nPricing:\n\nLite: $9.50/month + $11/extra user - 5 billable clients\n\nPlus: $16.50/month + $11/extra user- 50 billable clients\n\nPremium: $30/month + $11/extra user- Unlimited billable clients\n\nSelect: Custom pricing for larger agencies\n\n5. QuickBooks\n\nQuickBooks is an accounting platform with automation and advanced reporting features for service businesses. Some of its finance software features include:\n\n1. Client Management Portal\n\nYour clients get access to QuickBooks' Customer Portal and Payment Central. This secure hub lets them view estimates, approve proposals, and pay through the QuickBooks ecosystem. It supports multiple currencies and payment methods, including ACH transfers and credit cards. You can also customize client statements and set automatic payment reminders to reduce collection time.\n\n2. Project Management System\n\nQuickBooks doesn't help you manage active tasks like traditional project management software. It helps you link your finances directly to a project so the invoicing process can be simpler.\n\nYou can track profitability in real time with job costing features that capture every expense, including contractor payments and billable hours. The system also creates detailed project profit & loss statements and helps you monitor budgets against actual spending.\n\n3.

Client Management Portal\n\nYour clients interact with the portal through a straightforward payment interface. They can see their invoices, pay online, and see their billing history. Wave processes credit card and bank payments, though you’ll pay charges per transaction.\n\nWhile the portal handles basic financial interactions, it doesn't include project collaboration or feedback tools like ManyRequests.\n\n2. Project Management System\n\nWave is more focused on income and expense tracking and doesn’t have the typical project management feature. It lets you monitor basic project financials and categorize transactions by project.\n\nHowever, you can integrate Zapier into the finance tool to manage all projects. You can also check project income and expenses through its reporting feature.\n\n3. Time Tracking & Automated Billing\n\nWave does not have a built-in time-tracking tool. It's a financial accounting tool that supports billing and automated payment reminders. It also charges 2.9% + 30¢ per credit card transaction or 1% per bank payment.\n\nPros:\n\nFree accounting features\n\nUnlimited invoicing\n\nGood transaction management\n\nClean, simple interface\n\nReceipt scanning included\n\nCons:\n\nNo time tracking\n\nBasic project features\n\nLimited integrations\n\nPay-per-transaction model\n\nPricing:\n\nStarter: Free with 2.9% + $0.60 per credit card transaction\n\nPro: $16/m with 2.9% + $0* per credit card transaction for first 10 transactions/mo\n\n10.

Project Management System\n\nProductive lets you manage, create, and assign tasks to your team members. You can monitor budgets, track utilization rates, and forecast project margins in real-time. You can also use the different project views to work with teams and customize the tasks in any way you like.\n\n3. Time Tracking & Automated Billing\n\nYou track time with built-in timers or manual entries. The system creates invoices from tracked time and supports fixed-fee, time and materials, and retainer billing models. You can also use automated payment reminders to fast-track collection times.\n\nPros:\n\nStrong resource planning tools\n\nReal-time profitability tracking\n\nAdvanced forecasting features\n\nBuilt-in sales pipeline\n\nComprehensive agency metrics\n\nCons:\n\nSteeper learning curve\n\nIt may be expensive for small teams\n\nComplex setup process\n\nRequires consistent team adoption\n\nPricing:\n\nEssential: $11/user/month\n\nProfessional: $28/user/month\n\nUltimate: $39/user/month\n\nAs a recap:\n\nConclusion\n\nFinancial tools help you manage your cash flow from invoicing to budgeting to billing and payment support management. However, if you need advanced financial reporting and tax compliance features across multiple currencies, choose Xero. It's best when you have complex accounting needs and work regularly with accountants.\n\nFor freelancers and small teams focused on contracts and basic financial management, try Bonsai. Its contract templates and simple billing system cover essential needs without complexity.",
      "# [Think twice about Wayland. It breaks everything!](https://gist.github.com/probonopd/9feb7c20257af5dd915e3a9f2d1f2277)\nThink twice before abandoning Xorg. Wayland breaks everything!\n\nHence, if you are interested in existing applications to \"just work\" without the need for adjustments, then you may be better off avoiding Wayland.\n\nWayland solves no issues I have but breaks almost everything I need. Even the most basic, most simple things (like xkill) - in this case with no obvious replacement. And usually it stays broken, because the Wayland folks mostly seem to care about Automotive, Gnome, maybe KDE - and alienating everyone else (e.g., people using just an X11 window manager or something like GNUstep) in the process.\n\nAs 2024 is winding down:\n\nFor the record, even in the latest Raspberry Pi OS you still can't drag a file from inside a zip file onto the desktop for it to be extracted. So drag-and-drop is still broken for me.\n\nAnd Qt move() on a window still doesn't work like it does on all other desktop platforms (and the Wayland folks think that is good).\n\nAnd global menus still don't work (outside of not universally implemented things like qt_extended_surface set_generic_property).\n\nThe Wayland project seems to operate like they were starting a greenfield project, whereas at the same time they try to position Wayland as \"the X11 successor\", which would clearly require a lot of thought about not breaking, or at least providing a smooth upgrade path for, existing software.\n\nIn fact, it is merely an incompatible alternative, and not even one that has (nor wants to have) feature parity (missing features). And unlike X11 (the X Window System), Wayland protocol designers actively avoid the concept of \"windows\" (making up incomprehensible words like \"xdg_toplevel\" instead).\n\nDO NOT USE A WAYLAND SESSION! Let Wayland not destroy everything and then have other people fix the damage it caused. Or force more Red Hat/Gnome components (glib, Portals, Pipewire) on everyone!\n\nPlease add more examples to the list.\n\nWayland seems to be made by people who do not care for existing software. They assume everyone is happy to either rewrite everything or to just use Gnome on Linux (rather than, say, twm with ROX Filer on NetBSD).\n\nEdit: When I wrote the above, I didn't really realize what Wayland even was, I just noticed that some distributions (like Fedora) started pushing it onto me and things didn't work properly there. Today I realize that you can't \"install Wayland\", because unlike Xorg, there is not one \"Wayland display server\" but actually every desktop envrironment has its own. And maybe \"the Wayland folks\" don't \"only care about Gnome\", but then, any fix that is done in Gnome's Wayland implementation isn't automatically going to benefit all users of Wayland-based software, and possibly isn't even the implementation \"the Wayland folks\" would necessarily recommend.\n\nEdit 12/2023: If something wants to replace X11 for desktop computers (such as professional Unix workstations), then it better support all needed features (and key concepts, like windows) for that use case. That people also have displays on their fridge doesn't matter the least bit in that context of discussion. Let's propose the missing Wayland protocols for full X11 feature parity.\n\nEdit 08/2024: \"Does Wayland becoming the defacto standard display server for Linux serve to marginalize BSD?\" https://fossforce.com/2024/07/the-unintended-consequences-linuxs-wayland-adoption-will-have-on-bsd/\n\nWayland is broken by design\n\nA crash in the window manager takes down all running applications\n\nYou cannot run applications as root\n\nYou cannot do a lot of things that you can do in Xorg by design\n\nThere is not one /usr/bin/wayland display server application that is desktop environment agnostic and is used by everyone (unlike with Xorg)\n\nIt offloads a lot of work to each and every window manager. As a result, the same basic features get implemented differently in different window managers, with different behaviors and bugs - so what works on desktop environment A does not necessarily work in desktop environment B (e.g., often you hear that something \"works in Wayland\", even though it only really works on Gnome and KDE, not in all Wayland implementations). This summarizes it very well: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland/-/issues/233\n\nApparently the Wayland project doesn't even want to be \"X.org 2.0\", and doesn't want to provide a commonly used implementation of a compositor that could be used by everyone: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland/-/issues/233. Yet this would imho be required if they want to make it into a worthwile \"successor\" that would have any chance of ever fixing the many Wayland issues at the core.\n\nWayland breaks screen recording applications\n\nMaartenBaert/ssr#431 ❌ broken since 24 Jan 2016, no resolution (\"I guess they use a non-standard GNOME interface for this\")\n\nhttps://github.com/mhsabbagh/green-recorder ❌ (\"I am no longer interested in working with things like ffmpeg/wayland/GNOME's screencaster or solving the issues related to them or why they don't work\")\n\nvkohaupt/vokoscreenNG#51 ❌ broken since at least 7 Mar 2020. (\"I have now decided that there will be no Wayland support for the time being. Reason, there is no budget for it. Let's see how it looks in a year or two.\") - This is the key problem. Wayland breaks everything and then expects others to fix the wreckage it caused on their own expense.\n\nobsproject/obs-studio#2471 ❌ broken since at least 7 Mar 2020. (\"Wayland is unsupported at this time\", \"There isn't really something that can just be easily changed. Wayland provides no capture APIs\")\n\nThere is a workaround for OBS Studio that requires a obs-xdg-portal plugin (which is known to be Red Hat/Flatpak-centric, GNOME-centric, \"perhaps\" works with other desktops)\n\nphw/peek#1191 ❌ broken since 14 Jan 2023. Peek, a screen recording tool, has been abandoned by its developerdue to a number of technical challenges, mostly with Gtk and Wayland (\"Many of these have to do with how Wayland changed the way applications are being handled\")\n\nAs of February 2024, screen recording is still broken utterly on Wayland with the vast majority of tools. Proof\n\nWorkaround: Find a Wayland compositor that supports the wlr-screencopy-unstable-v1 protocol and use wf-recorder -a. The default compositor in Raspberry Pi OS (Wayfire) does, but the default compositor in Ubuntu doesn't. (That's the worst part of Wayland: Unlike with Xorg, it always depends on the particular Wayand compositor what works and what is broken. Is there even one that supports everything?)\n\nWayland breaks screen sharing applications\n\njitsi/jitsi-meet#2350 ❌ broken since 3 Jan 2018\n\njitsi/jitsi-meet#6389 ❌ broken since 24 Jan 2016 (\"Closing since there is nothing we can do from the Jitsi Meet side.\") See? Wayland breaks stuff and leaves application developers helpless and unable to fix the breakage, even if they wanted.\n\nNOTE: As of November 2023, screen sharing in Chromium using Jitsi Meet is still utterly broken, both in Raspberry Pi OS Desktop, and in a KDE Plasma installation, albeit with different behavior. Note that Pipewire, Portals and whatnot are installed, and even with them it does not work.\n\nraspberrypi/bookworm-feedback#149 (comment) ❌ broken since at least Nov 17, 2023 (\"window sharing not being available in wlroots derived compositors (such as wayfire)\")\n\nflathub/us.zoom.Zoom#22 Zoom ❌ broken since at least 4 Jan 2019.

The nouveau driver has been giving unsatisfactory performance since its inception. Even clicking on the application starter icon in Gnome results in a stuttery animation. Only the proprietary NVidia driver results in full performance.\n\nSee below.\n\nUpdate 2024: The situation might slowly be improving. It remains to be seen whether this will work well also for all existing old Nvidia hardware (that works well in Xorg).\n\nWayland does not work properly on Intel hardware\n\nhttps://cfenollosa.com/blog/fed-up-with-the-mac-i-spent-six-months-with-a-linux-laptop-the-grass-is-not-greener-on-the-other-side.html ❌ broken since at least 02 Apr 2021 (\"Screen tearing with the intel driver.

(...) In general, Wayland is moving away from the modularity, portability, and standardization of the X server. (...) I've decided to take a break from this, since it's a fairly huge undertaking and uphill battle. Right now, X11 combined with a compositor like picom or xcompmgr is the more mature option.\"\n\nWayland complicates server-side window decorations\n\nhttps://blog.martin-graesslin.com/blog/2018/01/server-side-decorations-and-wayland/ ❌ FUD since at least 27 January 2018 (\"I heard that GNOME is currently trying to lobby for all applications implementing client-side decorations. One of the arguments seems to be that CSD is a must on Wayland. \" ... \"I’m burnt from it and are not interested in it any more.\") Server-side window decorations are what make the title bar and buttons of all windows on a system consistent. They are a must have_ for a consistent system, so that applications written e.g., Gtk will not look entirely alien on e.g., a Qt based desktop, and to enforce that developers cannot place random controls into window titles where they do not belong. Client-side decorations, on the other hand, are destroying uniformity and consistency, put additional burden on application and toolkit developers, and allow e.g., GNOME developers to put random controls (that do not belong there) into window titles (like buttons), hence making it more difficult to achieve a uniform look and feel for all applications regardless of the toolkit being used.\n\nRed Hat employee Matthias Clasen (\"I work at the Red Hat Desktop team... I am actually a manager there... the people who do the actual work work for me\") expicitly stated \"Client-side everything\" as a principle, even though the protocol doesn't enforce it: \"Fonts, Rendering, Nested Windows, Decorations. \"It also gives the design more freedom to use the titlebar space, which is something our designers appreciate\" (sic).

Currently Electron uses _NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_TASKBAR to tell the WM to hide an app from the taskbar, and this works fine on X11 but there's no equivalent mechanism in Wayland.\" Workarounds are only available for some desktops including GNOME and KDE Plasma.) ❌ broken since March 10, 2022\n\nWayland breaks NoMachine NX\n\nhttps://kb.nomachine.com/TR03S10126?s=wayland ❌ broken since 2021-03-09 (\"The session becomes unresponsive once logged-in to the Wayland desktop\")\n\nWayland breaks xclip\n\nxclip is a command line utility that is designed to run on any system with an X11 implementation.

For example, a file manager might store the path that the window represents in an X11 atom, so that it (and other applications) can know for which paths there are open file manager windows. Wayland is not compatible to X11 atoms, resulting in all software that relies on them to be broken until specifically ported to Wayland (which, in the case of legacy software, may well be never).\n\nPossible workaround (to be verified): Use the (Qt proprietary?) Extended Surface Wayland protocol casually mentioned in https://blog.broulik.de/2016/10/global-menus-returning/ \"which allows you to set (and read?) arbitrary properties on a window\".

This is serious breakage, as not all desktop environments (for good reasons) use .desktop files. A display server should have no business in this, as this belongs into the domain of the desktop environment. https://community.kde.org/Guidelines_and_HOWTOs/Wayland_Porting_Notes#Application_Icon, https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/issues/52 ❌ broken since 2021-06-21\n\nQt setWindowIcon has no effect on KDE/Wayland https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-101427 (\"Resolution: Out of scope\", meaning it cannot be fixed in Qt, \"Using QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb works, though\", meaning that if you disable Wayland then it works) ❌ broken since 2022-03-03\n\nLibrePCB developer: \"Btw it's just one of several problems we have with Wayland, therefore we still enforce LibrePCB to run with Xwayland.

      "# [We Tested and Reviewed 6 Best Architect CRM in 2025](https://www.manyrequests.com/blog/architect-crm)\nIf you searched for CRM tools on forums like Quora and Reddit, you’d get tons of advice. This person, for instance, is a one-man team looking for advice on what CRM to use for their architecture clients,\n\nand this other agency owner has the money, but isn't sure of what CRM to invest it in:\n\nI read many of these conversations, and there was one constant answer— there's no one-size-fits-all customer relationship management tool. You’d have to sift through their features, automation, integration, and many others to know if they're a good fit for your agency or not.\n\nSo, I tested and reviewed six of the most “talked about” CRM software so you don't have to. In this article, I'll discuss each tool’s CRM features, to help you choose the best one for your agency.\n\n6 Best Architect CRM in 2025\n\nWe tested and reviewed 6 architect CRM tools for your agency:\n\nManyRequests\n\n🔥 ManyRequests is a client portal and project management software with CRM features to keep your client’s information.\n\nIt documents client journeys with your agency, from the onboarding process to their first requests and every discussion and revision you make for their design projects.\n\nManyRequests also gives you a centralized platform that provides:\n\na simple way to communicate with your clients,\n\na billing process to automate invoicing and payment processes,\n\nproject tracking features that give you a bird eye view of each project from start to finish,\n\nand a way to keep all client information for future use.\n\nThese are some of the CRM features you’ll find on ManyRequests:\n\nClient Portal\n\nManyRequests has a custom-branded portal to help you interact with your clients.\n\nThrough that portal, your client can log in to your platform, see their active project and associated details, and monitor project statuses. This helps you show progress without sending actual text messages, except if they ask for specific information.\n\nThey can also submit task Requests whenever they need your agency to work on something—of course, they’ll be billed for this. You can also share documents, PDFs, or files in other formats and save them in a dedicated storage folder so everyone on your team can access them. This increases accessibility to the information required to complete existing projects.\n\nIf there are areas you don't want clients to see, you can set permissions to what they can see on the platform.\n\nManyRequests' Impersonate feature also lets you check what your portal looks like from the perspective of your client.\n\nThis client portal is also white-labeled, which means you can interact with your clients without the ManyRequests logo on your portal. This helps you change colors to fit your agency’s color preferences and use a custom URL that makes it feel like the portal is custom-built for you from scratch.\n\nHere's an example from MagicDesign:\n\nMagicDesign, a design subscription service, uses the ManyRequests white-label feature to fully customize its platform, and improve client interaction.\n\nThey use the CRM feature to manage their fast-growing client base easily. Even the co-founder says ManyRequests helps them grow “Our customer base to 50+ businesses and are seeing no sign of slowing down”.\n\nAside from the client portal, you can use the service catalog to show all the service categories you offer. First-time or retainer clients can log into the platform and pick a service they want. ManyRequests notifies you, and you’ll acknowledge the client’s requests.\n\nFor payments, you can set a 100% upfront payment, hourly-based pricing,, or credit-based pricing, where clients can pay bit by bit or set milestones.\n\nHere's an example from MagicDesign:\n\nIt's an easier way to clarify your services and how much you charge for them.\n\nDesign Annotation and File Sharing\n\nManyRequests design annotation feature turns your design files into interactive workspaces.\n\nIt lets you and your client comment on design documents directly.\n\nWhen you upload a design, your team and clients can click anywhere to add comments and leave notes.\n\nEach click creates a numbered pin that connects to the comments made.\n\nThese pins work as conversation points. It's almost like pointing at something in person and explaining your thoughts on it.\n\nYour team can click these numbers to see edits or notes your client left on the design document.\n\nFor context, if your client suggests adjusting the kitchen layout to accommodate a larger island, that feedback stays linked to the exact spot they think you should adjust.\n\nYour team can reply within that pin’s thread, and every conversation you have regarding that expansion stays in one place.\n\nOnce a comment has been implemented, you can mark it as \"resolved.”\n\nNow, the conversations won't disappear because the project has been resolved.\n\nManyRequests saves every feedback edit to show you a clear record of the whole process.\n\nProject Management CRM\n\nManyRequests puts all your project information in one central dashboard.\n\nThe dashboard gives you a bird's-eye view of every project your team is working on. You can see\n\nThe task,\n\nThe client's name,\n\nWho you assigned it to,\n\nDue date,\n\nThe task’s status, and\n\nEven the priority levels.\n\nWhen your client submits a design request through the ManyRequests portal, you can assign your team members to tasks within those projects. This way, everyone knows their responsibilities and when task submissions are due.\n\nIntegrations\n\nManyRequests does not integrate with architecture software, like AutoCAD, BIM, or other 3D rendering tools.\n\nHowever, you can export and upload files you created in AUTOCAD or BIM as PDFs to ManyRequests so that you can share them with clients.\n\nYour clients can view and annotate the drawings you upload through ManyRequests, and you can implement that edit manually in your design software.\n\nPros\n\nManyRequests consolidates several features into one platform, which reduces the need to subscribe to many tools.\n\nManyRequests doesn't take a cut of your revenue, like many white-label software may do.\n\nManyRequests has an impressive design annotation feature.\n\nCons\n\nIt doesn’t have complex automation, although you can use the integration with Zapier to trigger actions based on your customization.\n\nPricing\n\nManyRequests subscription plan starts at $99 monthly for a 2-team seat, $149 monthly for 5-team seats, and $399 monthly for 10-team seats.\n\nThere's also an option to subscribe to a customized plan if your team has over 25 members.\n\nSalesforce\n\n🔥 Salesforce is a cloud-based CRM software. It helps you manage customer data with no coding knowledge needed. Salesforce saves every customer information in one place so your team can access this data for future use.\n\nSome of its features include:\n\nContact Management\n\nSalesforce tracks every detail about your customers in one place.\n\nYou can store basic information like their names, phone numbers, and email addresses.\n\nThe software also provides deeper information, such as when they last bought from you, the problems they encountered, and insights from their social media interactions.\n\nThis helps your customer service and other teams understand clients better when they click on their profile.\n\nOpportunity Management\n\nYou can track potential sales from start to finish with Salesforce.\n\nAll you need to do is enter a possible project, maybe a city planning board that needs to redesign its public library or a client that wants to expand its kitchen.\n\nYou can track every milestone the project hits— consultation, presenting concepts, schematic approval, documenting construction, execution, etc…\n\nSalesforce can help you track what stage your projects are at and what the next stage is.\n\nReports and Dashboards\n\nSalesforce helps you convert your sales data into insights. You can create reports with a simple drag-and-drop feature to answer specific questions, like your sales by quarter, your potential sales, and many more.\n\nPros\n\nYou can customize your email templates, fields, tabs, and other custom objects with Salesforce.\n\nSalesforce uses a subscription fee based on how many people are on your team, and it's easy to scale to another plan if your team grows.\n\nCons\n\nSalesforce has a steep learning curve, so your team may not understand it fast.\n\nProduct costs are higher than most CRM tools in the market.\n\nPricing\n\nSalesforce pricing varies based on the plans and features you choose, but Salesforce’s sales and service cloud starts at $25 per month, and its marketing cloud starts at $1,250 per month.\n\nHubSpot\n\n🔥 HubSpot is a comprehensive CRM for architecture firms and creative agencies. It tracks your entire customer journey from start to finish.\n\nIt doesn't have a dedicated client portal like ManyRequests, but these are some of its CRM features:\n\nList Segmentation\n\nHubSpot lets you group your contacts based on who they are and what they do.\n\nIt records details about potential customers who interact with your business, like their industry, company size, and actions.\n\nThese lists usually become your buyer personas of ideal customers.\n\nYou can also group contacts into lists when they have taken similar actions, like registering for your webinar.\n\nYou can use these details to create targeted messages that match each group's interest.\n\nHubSpot does this in two ways:\n\nActive lists: updates automatically based on the rules you set.\n\nFor example, you could create a list for \"Engineering Firms in California with 50+ Employees\". HubSpot will add or remove contacts as they meet or leave these criteria.\n\nWhen a firm grows to 50 employees or moves to California, they join the list. If they downsize or relocate, HubSpot removes them from the list.\n\nStatic lists: Capture one moment at a time. If you hosted an architecture conference, for example, you can create a static list of attendees.\n\nYou can use it to send event follow-ups or even next year's invitations. The list stays the same even when the contacts you add update their information.\n\nDeal Tracking\n\nHubSpot lets you track the progress of deals through various stages. You can create deals, link them with clients, and customize the stages that the project will go through. It will help you monitor your sales pipeline effectively.\n\nAutomated Workflows\n\nHubSpot tracks if any user reads your architectural portfolio and if your design showcases and scores these leads based on their engagement.\n\nWhen prospects check your designs, HubSpot sends an alert to your sales team, and you can handle the lead from there.\n\nYou can also control who sees your content— you can send commercial design cases to business owners and send residential portfolios to homeowners. HubSpot pushes them to the right prospect, and your sales team takes it from there.\n\nPros\n\nHubSpot has a free version.\n\nIt provides tools to help you organize and nurture customer relationships.\n\nCons\n\nLower plans don't have important features like A/B testing and advanced automation, so you may need to unnecessarily scale up to access these features.\n\nPricing\n\nHubSpot prices also depend on the features you need. For agencies, the lowest pricing starts at $20 monthly per user. Their pricing page has more information.\n\nEngagebay\n\n🔥 EngageBay is an all-in-one CRM software for your agency. It automates your customer service in a way that helps your agency organize your operation easily.\n\nEngageBay uses different tools and features to help agencies like yours manage their customer relationships and sales pipeline.\n\nLet's take a look at some of its features:\n\nContact Management\n\nEngageBay lets you keep a comprehensive database of every client and contractor that has interacted with your agency in the past.\n\nYou can store all their details, including their contact information and project history, in one place.\n\nEngageBay also tracks your meetings with clients, whether you emailed them, called them, or had video meetings with them.\n\nThere's also a segmentation feature like HubSpot. The software doesn't have a client portal, but it manages your client information well.\n\nAppointment Scheduling\n\nEngageBay integrates with Google Calendar to help you manage appointments. You can send automated reminders to clients about upcoming meetings.\n\nThere's also a feature to customize booking links— you can create personalized booking links for clients to schedule consultations at their convenience.\n\nIntegration\n\nEngageBay doesn't integrate with architecture software, but it syncs with some general tools that may be useful for your agency, like DocuSign, Linkedin, Google Calendar, and PandaDoc.\n\nPros\n\nProvides an all-in-one solution\n\nHas automation features\n\nIt has a free plan\n\nCons\n\nUsers have found Engagebay reporting features lacking.\n\nPricing\n\nEngageBay has a free plan. Its basic plan starts at $12.74 monthly per user, its growth plan is $55.24 monthly per user, and there's a Pro plan that goes up to $101.99 monthly per user.\n\nMonday.com\n\n🔥 Monday.com is a CRM software for project management, collaboration, and task tracking. It helps you organize your projects and interact with clients clearly.\n\nSome of its features include:\n\nAutomation\n\nMonday.com’s automation reduces manual tasks in your workflow. You can trigger actions based on specific events.\n\nFor example, you can ask Monday.com to email your manager when a task status changes to Done.\n\nMonday.com lets you use pre-built automation templates, or you can create your own with an if-then structure— IF (trigger event happens) — THEN (action occurs).\n\nMonday’s no-code builder means you can click and select options rather than write codes. You pick:\n\nThe trigger (what starts the automation)\n\nThe conditions (when the automation should run)\n\nThe actions (what happens next)\n\nFor context, in the screenshot above, the user prompts Monday to:\n\nNotify the sales rep when an email is opened.\n\nAssign Brandon Lee as owner when the region changes to the US.\n\nTo move items to qualified leads when the stage changes to Qualified (New account).\n\nClient Communication\n\nMonday.com integrates with your Gmail or Outlook account directly.\n\nThis integration tracks every email exchange with your client automatically, and Monday notifies you when your client opens or replies to your email.\n\nYou can also write these emails faster with Monday.com's AI.\n\nYou start with a basic message, and the AI suggests improvements or entire drafts based on your communication style.\n\nAnother impressive feature is that you can create one template and personalize it for each client. Monday automatically fills in details, like the client’s name and company information.\n\nPerformance Tracking\n\nMonday.com performance tracking works in many ways:\n\nDashboard reports: shows your current sales number. You’ll see projects, revenue, and your team’s report in one place.\n\nThe revenue forecasts feature shows every project’s value and closing profitability. Monday.com also projects future revenue, and you can filter the results by month, team, or sales rep.\n\nThe activity log records every project activity, including calls, emails, and meetings. It shows you what your team does daily.\n\nPros\n\nProvides customizable features\n\nHas automation tools\n\nMonday.con integrates with several tools.\n\nCons\n\nTime tracking is only available in higher-tiered plans.\n\nPricing\n\nMonday.com’s basic plan starts at $12 per user/ monthly, its standard plan is $14 per user /monthly, and its Pro plan is $24 per user/ monthly.\n\nPipedrive\n\n🔥 Pipedrive is a customer relationship management (CRM) software for small to medium-sized businesses.‍\n\nIt helps your team track and organize their sales processes by providing tools like:\n\nCRM Features\n\nPipedrive's visual pipeline shows all your active projects. You can move each project between stages by dragging and dropping them— it helps you know which project needs more attention.\n\nIt also automates your routine tasks. When a task changes stage, Pipedrive will send you emails and notify your team automatically, so you don't have to do it manually.\n\nPipedrive lets you control how the CRM works. You can set your project stages and add fields that matter to your sales process. The system handles different currencies and connects to your other tools.\n\nAutomation\n\nPipedrive's automation handles your routine tasks. When deals move forward, the system sends preset emails automatically. For instance, new leads get welcome messages, and prospects receive follow-ups after meetings.\n\nIntegration\n\nPipedrive integrates with over 350 tools, including Microsoft Teams, Trello, Zapier, MailChimp, but it doesn't integrate with major architecture tools.\n\nPros\n\nPipelines are customizable\n\nPipedrive has a user-friendly interface.\n\nCons\n\nSome beginners have found it hard to navigate.\n\nPricing\n\nPipedrive's essential plan starts at $24 monthly per seat, the Advanced at $44, Professional at $64, Power at $79, and Enterprise at $129.\n\nConclusion\n\nYour agency's needs should determine which CRM you’ll choose. Figure out what slows down your project management and client relationships — do you need better ways to track design revisions? Are you struggling with handling client feedback? Is your project timeline all over the place? CRM software that answers and provides solutions to these problems is the best one for you.\n\nI recommend ManyRequests if you're struggling with customer relationships.
