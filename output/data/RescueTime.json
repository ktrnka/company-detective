      "# [Privacy Policy](https://www.rescuetime.com/privacy)\nMost recent version: July 10, 2023.\n\nBy using RescueTime, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your personal information for the purposes of providing you our product services as described below. We will notify all active accounts of any significant changes to this policy.\n\nYour data is never shared\n\nYour privacy is really important to us. At RescueTime, your data, analyzed, is the product we offer back to you. We are not an ad supported company. Our free service is intended to entice you to premium service. If you have any concerns that aren't covered here, please contact us. Below are the details of this policy:\n\nWe will never sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal information, with or without personally identifying information. Furthermore, we will never share anonymized selections of your individual data. That includes any government (foreign or domestic) unless we are compelled by law. If we are required by law to disclose any of the information collected about you, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email. We will independently object to overly broad requests for access to information about users of our site.\n\nWe may share information about user behavior in the aggregate only. For example, we could share information like, \"which day of the week do people spend the most time in front of their computer?\" This type of analysis is used to enrich the product, and to represent our domain expertise to our audiences.\n\nYou can delete your data at any time — all of it, or just a slice of it. You can also delete your account at any time. Deleting your account deletes all your data from our database.\n\nWe won't spam you, ever, either directly or indirectly by sharing of email information. We might occasionally send one-time messages about important RescueTime news. We will likely continue to introduce ways that you can optionally have RescueTime contact you with data that you care about, but you will always be able to turn this on or off.\n\nFor individual accounts, no other user can see any of your data or personal information. We may provide features to allow you to share selections of your data, but this will be voluntary and opt-in only, and handled per-situation, and not buried in a terms of service.\n\nFor team accounts, sharing of data is controlled by the administrator of the account and by default does not allow anyone in the team account access to your data. No one outside of your organization will have access to any of your data. Default team implementations do not permit the sharing of individual data in any form that is not aggregated (eg, your team's average communication per week). When consulting with team implementations, we promote transparency and user driven control.\n\nHow do we protect your data?\n\nYour data is always encrypted in transit. All requests with the RescueTime web app and client apps are encrypted with current best practice SSL configurations.\n\nYour data is always encrypted at rest. All of our storage uses volume encryption.\n\nWe maintain ongoing vulnerability scanning, respond immediately to security advisories, and stay PCI compliant.\n\nWhat information does RescueTime collect? How is it used?\n\nAccount information includes email address (verification optional), city, state, and country. Optional demographic information includes gender, date of birth, industry, job title, company size, and income may be requested, to enrich the accuracy of our reporting for your work patterns.\n\nRescueTime records information about the currently active application or website on your computer. We record for processing the following information: 1) for time analysis: application name, web site URL, window title, start time of use, end time of use and 2) for distinguishing you and your device: device login name (your system user name), device name, device operating system version, and sometimes the manufacturer. For some inputs, the public internet address you are operating from is saved, for your security (and ours), and for troubleshooting. Like all activity information, it is discarded with account deletion.\n\nWe do not (and never will) collect keystrokes, form input, screenshots, window or page body content, or anything nefarious. Before storage for your reports, URLs are trimmed to the site name and sometimes top level directory when a site has distinct web apps. Query strings are discarded. Site controls allow you to selectively delete and ignore forever any item you prefer not be stored.\n\nCookies and Log Files\n\nRescueTime.com sends a \"cookie\" to your computer that contains an identifier that is unique to your browser session. We use this cookie to validate your authentication, provide you with a continuous experience, and to record how our site/service is being used. It is not used for marketing purposes.\n\nAs is done with most web sites, we log each visit to each web page. A log entry can contain information typically found in the \"header\" of your web browser's request such as the browser type you used, your Internet Protocol address, and the date and time of day. We may also log your session identifier and the URL of a site that referred you. This log information is important for security, audit, quality improvement, as well as for monitoring the health of our service.",
      "# [RescueTime Security](https://www.rescuetime.com/security)\nInfrastructure and Platform: Safe Foundations\n\nA secure design for hardware, networks, and deployments.\n\nTo make RescueTime work, there are two principle components: the application that runs on your device and the cloud-based service that processes the data and builds results for you. The client runs on multiple platforms and devices (Windows, Apple OS X, Linux, Android, ChromeOS), and is principally responsible for automatically measuring how the device is used. The client also offers some additional user-facing features that are best delivered outside the browser. The cloud service receives data from the client and also provides the client with statistics and configuration information to enrich the user's experience and manage client features.\n\nThe Client Application Platform\n\nFor desktop systems, the client is built on a common codebase using standard cross-platform libraries that work across Windows, OS X and Linux. This encompasses the code used for secure communication with our servers, as well as configuration handling and time logic. We maintain our client with regular updates, publish change information, audit and test all changes, and track dependent library security updates. Our client is designed to be lightweight, with a negligible memory and processor footprint, using a compact codebase and minimized complexity to reduce risk.\n\nFor mobile systems, we currently support automatic time collection on Android devices, including phones and tablets. Our app is built entirely inside the Android SDK and so takes advantage of the Google Android team's own security provisions (app sandboxing, regular platform maintenance updates, etc).\n\nMore about how the client works >>\n\nThe Cloud Service Platform\n\nRescueTime data processing, reporting, and account management is handled through our website locations, which are all hosted on Amazon's EC2 facility. Out of the box, EC2 gives us audited robust infrastructure security, both physical and network level. On that foundation, we provide additional feature-targeted firewalling, privilege separation and controls, two-factor access methods, and logged, auditable operations interfaces. Our website services are built on common open-source platforms, apps and frameworks that we monitor for regular security maintenance updates, both at the operating system level and for required apps and libraries.\n\nAll operational interaction with our platform is accomplished through either HTTPS or SSH (secure tunnels). Our testing and development deployments are maintained in a matching configuration, with access only through HTTPS and SSH tunnels. We do not maintain any office based data storage or services. All of our engineering resources are secured in EC2 under the same practices and policies applied to the production configuration.\n\nMore about the site and web services >>\n\nRescueTime and HIPAA, HITECH, SAS70 and more\n\nHow regulations and policies may affect you.\n\nHIPAA / HITECH: privacy and security requirements\n\nWe have clients, including individuals and teams, in many different lines of business. Some have concerns driven by protection of intellectual property, others have regulatory requirements. For those under HIPAA compliance standards for their software purchases:\n\nIs it even required? HIPAA requirements are triggered when a software product maintains patient identifiable information. For this reason, your use of RescueTime would likely be covered by HIPAA, because some applications' window titles may have a patient's name or similar small but identifiable detail. It would be possible to take advantage of our privacy configurations and controls to restrict what is captured and measured, to prevent this requirement altogether while using RescueTime. However, this may limit the utility of the product to you.\n\n... So, assuming you need HIPAA compliance to use RescueTime:\n\nSecure network transmission: HIPAA requires that all transmission of data between your business or our software be encrypted. RescueTime meets this requirement.\n\nPhysical security: The service must be hosted in an access limited and monitored facility. RescueTime meets this requirement by maintaining all resources in Amazon's EC2 data center.\n\nAccess control: Operational access to the service must be secured for authorized use only and be auditable. RescueTime meets this requirement.\n\nSafe practices and policies: The service should maintain disaster recovery plans and offsite backups. RescueTime meets this requirement, primarily by leveraging features of Amazon's EC2 service.\n\nThe HITECH supplement requires SaaS products to report intrusion or security events that effect customers' data. Specifically, the requirement is that if customer data resides in storage unencrypted (for example, a backup), even in a secured environment, that the service provider (us) must notify all and any customers whose data could have been vulnerable as the result of an intrusion event or other security violation. RescueTime guarantees its customers that it will alert any and all customers possibly affected by a security defect or hacking event.\n\nNote: At this time, RescueTime has not contracted an audit firm to provide third party validation of compliance. Please contact sales@rescuetime.com for more information on how we can accommodate your needs.\n\nSAS70 and the rest\n\nRescueTime is a fast growing business, and we contract services as needed as we continue to grow. As of this time we have not engaged our own SAS70 audit. Much of what these audits require is covered simply by operating on EC2. However, the web site services above and beyond the platform level is not. We are happy to consider all questions regarding obtaining audits. We have some clients that perform their own tests against our system to ensure we meet their standards.",
      "# [RescueTime Use Cases: Knowledge Workers, Entrepreneurs, Managers, Students](https://www.rescuetime.com/customer_stories)\nTell me if this sounds familiar: You’re working harder and longer than ever to meet deadlines and hit your goals. But no matter how much you work you still feel behind.\n\nThis was the exact situation AirBnB developer Jonathan White found himself in. With a full schedule at one of the biggest tech companies in the world, a number of side projects on the go, plus a social life, he found himself regularly working 12-14-hour days. But it still never felt like enough.\n\nEven worse, the more he tried to keep up with everything, the more he felt himself slipping towards burnout. Something had to change.\n\nHow Jonathan used RescueTime to optimize his time\n\nAfter using RescueTime for a few days, Jonathan started to see real data about his productive time. And it wasn’t great.\n\nBy looking at his Productivity by Time of Day, he quickly realized that despite working long hours (often late into the night) and feeling productive, there was a clear diminishing return the more he worked.\n\nSpecifically, his productivity levels were dipping in the evenings when he was more likely to get distracted by social media and entertainment.\n\n“Without knowing exactly how much and when you’re working there’s no way to optimize your time. You can’t hit any sort of consistency because you’re always guessing.”\n\nWith an accurate understanding of how he spends his time, Jonathan was able to optimize his daily schedule an do his most important work when he’s more productive.\n\nIn practical terms, this meant blocking out a 2-hour window first-thing in the morning for focused work and then cutting himself off earlier when he knew his productivity was going to slip. At first, the thought of working less and still hitting his goals seemed impossible\n\nBut he quickly found that even though he had less time to work, he was getting more done.\n\n“While I had less absolute time, I had more more in time in terms of focused work.”\n\nWith his schedule optimized, Jonathan decided it was time to optimize other parts of his workday for focus and motivation. By checking his Productivity Pulse, he already knew that his phone and social media (especially sites like Hacker News) were his biggest distraction.\n\n“When I came up against a problem in my work, I’d start scrolling and browsing. My phone became my default for when I was feeling uncomfortable.”\n\nWith RescueTime, Jonathan was able to rebuild his schedule around focus, claw back from burnout, and reduce his working hours while getting more done. But he didn’t use RescueTime just for this initial optimization, but also to help maintain his productivity day after day, and week after week.\n\n“In this age of distraction, being able to focus for a long period of time on a single task is a competitive advantage few people have. RescueTime helps me identify not just how I spend my time but also when I’m most likely to do my best work each day.”\n\nWhen you’re busy running your own company it’s easy to dream of having more time each day. But what if that’s the wrong dream? More time doesn’t equal more productivity. Instead of optimizing for more time, you should be focusing on efficiency.\n\nThis insight has been the driving force behind the many successes of Srinivas Rao — the author, founder, and host of The Unmistakable Creative podcast.\n\nIn the span of a few years, Srinivas went from the shackles of a 9–5 to launching his own company, interviewing hundreds of the world’s most productive and interesting entrepreneurs, and publishing multiple best-selling books. But re-wiring his brain (and his schedule) for focus didn’t come easily at first.\n\nHow Srinivas mastered his daily time and focus\n\nNo one wants to think they’re distracted, unmotivated, or wasting time. Yet few of us take the time to really understand how we spend our days. As Srinivas explains, only time-tracking will tell you the truth about how effective and focused you are.\n\n“RescueTime exists because we’re dealing with a world of problems that didn’t exist in the past. Nothing offers more clarity than putting a number in front of your goal. All of a sudden it’s very clear whether you accomplished it or not.”\n\nUsing RescueTime, Srinivas got a clear picture of how he was spending his time over days, weeks, and months. Not only did this show him negative aspects (like when he was being distracted) but also helped him identify his peak productive hours during the day.\n\nWith an overview of his most productive hours and worst distractions, Srinivas started to experiment and optimize his daily schedule.\n\nThe first step was to remove distractions. By looking at his daily Productivity Pulse and connecting it to his Distracting Time one of the first things he discovered was that using social media first thing in the morning led to less productive days.\n\n“If you log into Facebook first thing in the morning, every link you click on and every article you read is a decision that’s naturally eroding your willpower. If you start your day this way, you’re going to feel distracted all day long.”\n\nNext, he started to dig into the other seemingly “productive” tasks that were getting in the way of real focus. This meant looking at Time Spent on Email as well as in meetings.\n\n“Nobody ever changed the world by checking email, so it’s insane that we spend so much time on it.”\n\nSrinivas is a fan of ‘batching’ emails (dealing with them only during select times). And even writes his emails in a different app to avoid getting distracted by his inbox. RescueTime’s Communication report keeps him honest about how much time he spends in emails. And he can even set Daily Goals to track email and communication time.\n\nFinally, Srinivas realized that optimizing his focus wasn’t just about the time spent working, but also getting enough rest. But as an entrepreneur, it’s hard to say when you’ve done “enough” each day.\n\n“When it comes to productivity, there’s a law of diminishing returns where at a certain point, the output you’re going to get from your efforts, despite the same effort, is going to decrease.”\n\nUsing RescueTime’s Work Hours, you’re able to separate your data, goals, and alerts between when you want to be working and when you should be resting so you can optimize for both.\n\n“Downtime is often where we get the most ROI on our thinking.”\n\nWhen you’re running a business, time is money. And when it comes to being more efficient with your time, the right data guides you.\n\n“The greatest value of Rescuetime is awareness. Most people waste their time because they don’t know they’re spending it. Rescuetime is the wakeup call and reality check most people need when they’re struggling to manage their time and attention.”\n\nHow Colleen doubled her productivity without burning out\n\nAs a freelancer, you’re more than just a writer/designer/developer. You also have to be your personal admin/bookkeeper/marketer/and a whole whack of other roles. And if you’re not careful, those other tasks can take over your time.\n\nThe first thing Colleen noticed when she started looking through her RescueTime data was just how much time was spent not writing or drawing.\n\n“Before using RescueTime, I was very bad about tracking how much of my time was going into my art. I’d sink way too much time into admin tasks and have no energy left for writing and drawing! I was puttering, doing busywork, but the real work is art, that has to come first.”\n\nBy far, the biggest offender was social media. While Colleen uses her social accounts to talk to fans and promote her work, it was taking up way too much time in her day.\n\nBut by using her Time Spent on Social Media report, she was able to get a clear picture of just how much time it was taking up. And it was bad.\n\n“Until I began using RescueTime, I had no idea just how bad my social media overuse was. The reality of my habits was right there in my face and I was horrified.”\n\nShe quickly started to re-assess how she spent her time. First, this meant setting Goals and Alerts around her social media and writing time.\n\n“I love the RescueTime pop-ups that remind me of my goals. It makes me feel great to see my productivity going straight up—to see I’m getting better about managing things.”\n\nAs she slowly built up her productive time, she dug into her Trends to help track her progress over time.\n\n“The trends chart has been especially important for tracking my progress and seeing where I’m dipping and need to keep a lookout.”\n\nBy controlling the time she was spending on distractions and admin, Colleen was able to double her Productive Time in a matter of months. All without working more hours.\n\n“This summer, my Design and Composition hours dropped to only 67. I couldn’t focus and I felt terrible. A month later my Design and Composition hours jumped to 128 and then 160. More than double!”\n\nWith RescueTime, Colleen was able to counter the worst aspects of freelance life—the competing priorities, lack of guardrails, and potential for burnout. Instead of working more and feeling like she’s not hitting her goals, she’s built new habits that put her in control of her day.\n\n“In the time since I started using RescueTime I’ve gone from hours of social media use per day to about a half-hour. I can talk to my readers and promote projects without going overboard and using up all my creative mental energy before I even get to the drawing board!”\n\nHow Jonathan and Gary rebuilt their focus and broke bad habits\n\nLook up “time management tips for students” and you’ll be inundated with strategies for staying focused and motivated. However, as Jonathan explains, strategies only go so far:\n\n“I’ve definitely had trouble with being productive and avoiding procrastination in the past and ended up using lots of different tools and strategies, but it was never really clear what was having a real impact.”\n\nTo take action, experiment, and find the best time management strategies, you need to have an awareness of what works and what doesn’t. For both Gary and Jonathan, that meant using RescueTime’s automatic time tracking and productivity pulse to see where their time was actually going. As Jonathan explains:\n\n“With RescueTime, I can quickly see which activities or apps I’m spending the most time in to get a read on how productive (or not) I’m being.”\n\nOnce they had insight into their daily schedule and where their productivity was faltering, both students started to optimize their days. For Gary, this primarily meant setting a Goal for Daily Writing Time while he worked towards finishing his thesis.\n\n“At the moment, I’m spending an incredible amount of time writing up my Ph. D thesis and have goals for the number of hours I want to be spending on it each day so I can track my progress.”\n\nNot only does this help keep him accountable to his thesis work, but with Monthly Goal Tracking, Gary’s now able to see how productive he’s being on a daily basis as well as larger trends for his writing time.\n\n“It can be hard to keep yourself motivated if you’re not seeing any immediate results. But with RescueTime, I can review my data and know that I had a productive Monday, which sets me up for a good week. There’s motivation in just reviewing what you’ve done.”\n\nFor Jonathan, he was more concerned with tackling procrastination. With varying days and too many opportunities to get distracted, he needed to find ways to protect his focus.\n\n“I know that if I can start working on a task and get invested in it that it’s easy for me to spend 3–4 good productive hours on it. But getting over that initial procrastination is a struggle.”\n\nTo get over his procrastination, Jonathan set up an Alert to automatically start a 30-minute FocusTime session at the start of his day. This means all distractions are blocked as he starts working and gets focused on specific tasks.\n\nNot only that, but he uses a similar Alert for blocking distractions right after lunch to help protect his focus when his energy has naturally dipped. As he explains: “It’s a guardrail for me.”\n\nFor both students, RescueTime does something none of the other time management tools out there could: Give them both accurate insight into how they’re spending their time, and actionable advice and tools to help protect their focus, build better habits, and boost their productivity. As Gary says:\n\n“I didn’t realize how much time I was throwing down the drain just from small things like watching videos on YouTube. RescueTime gives me accuracy when it comes to knowing how I spend my time. I get a much more detailed picture of what I’m doing so I can make the changes I need to my schedule and habits.”",
      "# [Who We Are](https://www.rescuetime.com/about)\nRescueTime started when a few friends found themselves asking the same question at the end of every day: Where the h$^% does the time go?\n\nAfter putting in a long, hard day’s work, we were left wishing we had an extra hour (or two!) We couldn’t figure out where our time was going, so we built a tool that would tell us.\n\nWhat we discovered was that we were working hard, but not smart. Instead of long stretches of focused time, our days were spent bouncing between apps, websites, and tools without making any real progress on our goals.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how long you spend working if your attention and focus are gone. With RescueTime, we created a tool to help you take back control of your time so you can spend it on what matters most to you.",
      "# [RescueTime Terms of Service](https://www.rescuetime.com/tos)\n1. ACCEPTANCE\n\nRescueTime provides its service (”Service”) to you, subject to the following Terms of Service (”TOS”). The TOS tell you what you can expect from the Service, and what RescueTime expects of you. RescueTime may amend the TOS at any time by posting an amended TOS on our website.\n\n2. REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS\n\nYou must register for a membership in order to access the Service. When completing the registration form, you will provide true, accurate, and complete information, and maintain and promptly update this information. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, or incomplete, or RescueTime has reasonable grounds to suspect that the information is untrue, inaccurate, or incomplete, RescueTime has the right to suspend or terminate your membership and access to the Service. You are responsible for obtaining access to the Service, which access may involve third party fees (such as Internet service provider charges). In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the Service. You will enter a password and login name during the registration process. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and login name, and are responsible for all activities that occur with your password and login name, including fees incurred and all purchases made by your membership on the Service. This means that, unless your password and login name, or credit card information is obtained unlawfully or fraudulently, you will be responsible for all fees incurred and purchases made by your membership. You will immediately notify RescueTime of any unauthorized use of your membership or any other breach of security.\n\n3. MEMBERSHIP, FEES\n\nIndividuals may obtain a membership with the Service without paying a fee. RescueTime will charge fees to access certain components of the Service. If you must pay a fee to access a component of the Service, this information will be posted by RescueTime on the Service. You may use a credit card to pay these fees. When you use a credit card for payment, you represent to RescueTime that you are the authorized card holder. For recurring fees, RescueTime will charge your credit card each month. For one-time fees, RescueTime will charge your credit card once. RescueTime reserves the right to change its fees or billing methods. If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your membership, but RescueTime will not refund any fees that may have accrued to your membership before you cancel it. RescueTime may also charge you for any sales or use taxes to which the Service is subject.\n\n4. PROHIBITED USES\n\nYou agree that you will not:\n\nimpersonate any person, including a RescueTime employee or agent on the Service; violate any local, state, or national law through or on the Service; harass people through or on the Service; collect or store data about other people using the Service; use any device, software or routine to interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Service; take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on the infrastructure of the Service; use the Service in any manner other than as expressly authorized in the TOS; reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, or exploit for any commercial purposes, any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service.\n\n5. OWNERSHIP AND RESTRICTIONS\n\nThe license granted in these TOS does not constitute a transfer or sale of RescueTime’s ownership rights in the RescueTime Database. RescueTime retains all right, title, and interest in and to the RescueTime Database including all related intellectual property rights. You will use your best efforts to prevent and protect the contents of the RescueTime Database from unauthorized use or distribution.

You must not copy, reproduce, alter, modify, create derivative works, or publicly display any content of the Service, including the RescueTime Database, unless expressly authorized in the TOS.\n\n6. CHILDREN\n\nBy registering, installing, and accepting these TOS you represent to RescueTime that you are at least 13 years old. RescueTime’s policy is to prohibit children under the age of 13 from purchasing, accessing, registering, or using any of RescueTime’s products and services unless under the guidance, supervision and consent of their parents, guardians and/or authorized school officials. We rely on parents and guardians to ensure minors only use RescueTime products and services if they can understand their rights and responsibilities as stated in this TOS and our Privacy Policy.\n\nFor teachers or parents, if you want children under the age of 13 to create their own RescueTime accounts, then you (or your school) assume the responsibility for complying with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and, to the extent applicable, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”). This means you must notify childrens’ parents/guardians of the information to be collected and obtain parental/guardian consent before collecting and sharing with the RescueTime products and services the personal information of children under the age of 13 in order to establish an account or use the RescueTime products and service. Teachers may, under appropriate, circumstances provide such consent on behalf of parents/guardians. For more information on complying with COPPA, see the Federal Trade Commission’s website at http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm.\n\n7. RescueTime PRIVACY POLICY\n\nCertain registration information and other information about you may be collected by RescueTime and through the Service. RescueTime’s use of this information is governed by the RescueTime Privacy Policy.\n\n8. USER WARRANTY\n\nYou represent and warrant to RescueTime: (a) that you have full power, authority, and legal capacity to enter into the Agreements and follow its obligations, and if you are registering on behalf of a company or other entity, you have the authority to bind your principal or employer company; (b) you will provide complete and accurate information to RescueTime; and (c) you will pay all charges that you incur at RescueTime’s then-current rates.\n\n9. INDEMNITY\n\nYou will indemnify and hold RescueTime, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your use of the Service, your violation of the TOS, or your violation of any rights of a third party.\n\n10. MODIFICATIONS TO SERVICE\n\nRescueTime reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service or any part of it with or without notice. RescueTime will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Service.\n\n11. TERMINATION\n\nYou have the right to terminate or cancel your membership at any time. You understand and agree that the cancellation of your membership or a particular component of the Service is your sole right and remedy with respect to any dispute with RescueTime. This includes, but is not limited to, any dispute related to or arising out of: (a) any term of the TOS or RescueTime’s enforcement or application of the TOS; (b) any policy or practice of RescueTime, including the Privacy Policy, or RescueTime’s enforcement or application of these policies; (c) the data available through the Service; (d) your ability to access and use the Service; or (e) the amount or type of fees, surcharges, applicable taxes, and any RescueTime billing methods. RescueTime, in its sole discretion, may terminate your membership and remove and discard any of your Recommendations without notice if RescueTime believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the TOS. RescueTime will not be liable to you for termination of your membership to the Service. Sections 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16, and 17 will survive the termination of the TOS and your membership.\n\n12. LINKS\n\nThe Service may provide links to third party web sites. RescueTime has no control over these sites and is not responsible for their availability, does not endorse them, and is not responsible or liable for any content, goods, or services available from these sites.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES\n\nYOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. RescueTime EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT RELATED TO THE SERVICE. ANY MATERIAL OR DATA DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICE IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LOSS OF DATA OR EMAIL THAT RESULTS FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM RescueTime OR THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE TOS. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.\n\n14. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n\nRescueTime WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF RescueTime HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL RescueTime’S TOTAL LIABILITY OF ALL KINDS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTY CLAIMS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORUM AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY ACTION OR CLAIM IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT OF FEES PAID BY YOU TO RescueTime IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACTION GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY, AND (B) $100. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THE TOS. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n15. TRADEMARK INFORMATION\n\nRescueTime, the RescueTime logo, and other RescueTime logos, products and service names are trademarks of RescueTime. You must not display or use them in any manner.\n\n16. ARBITRATION\n\nAny legal controversy or legal claim arising out of or relating to the TOS or the Service, excluding legal action taken by RescueTime to collect fees or recover damages for, or obtain an injunction relating to, RescueTime’s intellectual property or the Service, will be settled by binding and final arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any controversy or claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis, and will not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. The arbitration will be conducted in King County, Washington, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered into any court having jurisdiction. Either you or RescueTime may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in King County, Washington necessary to protect the rights or property of you or RescueTime pending the completion of arbitration. Should either party file an action contrary to this provision, the other party may recover attorney’s fees and costs up to $1000.00.\n\n17. GENERAL INFORMATION\n\nRescueTime may provide notices to you pursuant to the TOS through email, regular mail, or by displaying conspicuous notices or links to notices to you on the Service. The TOS constitutes the entire agreement between you and RescueTime and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and RescueTime. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use other RescueTime products or services. The TOS and the relationship between you and RescueTime will be governed by the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You consent to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in King County, Washington. The failure of RescueTime to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS will not constitute a waiver of the right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found to be invalid, the other provisions of the TOS will remain in full force and effect. Any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.",

      "# [Privacy Policy](https://www.rescuetime.com/rtx/privacy)\nMost recent version: July 10, 2023.\n\nBy using RescueTime, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your personal information for the purposes of providing you our product services as described below. We will notify all active accounts of any significant changes to this policy.\n\nYour data is never shared\n\nYour privacy is really important to us. At RescueTime, your data, analyzed, is the product we offer back to you. We are not an ad supported company. Our free service is intended to entice you to premium service. If you have any concerns that aren't covered here, please contact us. Below are the details of this policy:\n\nWe will never sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal information, with or without personally identifying information. Furthermore, we will never share anonymized selections of your individual data. That includes any government (foreign or domestic) unless we are compelled by law. If we are required by law to disclose any of the information collected about you, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email. We will independently object to overly broad requests for access to information about users of our site.\n\nWe may share information about user behavior in the aggregate only. For example, we could share information like, \"which day of the week do people spend the most time in front of their computer?\" This type of analysis is used to enrich the product, and to represent our domain expertise to our audiences.\n\nYou can delete your data at any time — all of it, or just a slice of it. You can also delete your account at any time. Deleting your account deletes all your data from our database.\n\nWe won't spam you, ever, either directly or indirectly by sharing of email information. We might occasionally send one-time messages about important RescueTime news. We will likely continue to introduce ways that you can optionally have RescueTime contact you with data that you care about, but you will always be able to turn this on or off.\n\nFor individual accounts, no other user can see any of your data or personal information. We may provide features to allow you to share selections of your data, but this will be voluntary and opt-in only, and handled per-situation, and not buried in a terms of service.\n\nFor team accounts, sharing of data is controlled by the administrator of the account and by default does not allow anyone in the team account access to your data. No one outside of your organization will have access to any of your data. Default team implementations do not permit the sharing of individual data in any form that is not aggregated (eg, your team's average communication per week). When consulting with team implementations, we promote transparency and user driven control.\n\nHow do we protect your data?\n\nYour data is always encrypted in transit. All requests with the RescueTime web app and client apps are encrypted with current best practice SSL configurations.\n\nYour data is always encrypted at rest. All of our storage uses volume encryption.\n\nWe maintain ongoing vulnerability scanning, respond immediately to security advisories, and stay PCI compliant.\n\nWhat information does RescueTime collect? How is it used?\n\nAccount information includes email address (verification optional), city, state, and country. Optional demographic information includes gender, date of birth, industry, job title, company size, and income may be requested, to enrich the accuracy of our reporting for your work patterns.\n\nRescueTime records information about the currently active application or website on your computer. We record for processing the following information: 1) for time analysis: application name, web site URL, window title, start time of use, end time of use and 2) for distinguishing you and your device: device login name (your system user name), device name, device operating system version, and sometimes the manufacturer. For some inputs, the public internet address you are operating from is saved, for your security (and ours), and for troubleshooting. Like all activity information, it is discarded with account deletion.\n\nWe do not (and never will) collect keystrokes, form input, screenshots, window or page body content, or anything nefarious. Before storage for your reports, URLs are trimmed to the site name and sometimes top level directory when a site has distinct web apps. Query strings are discarded. Site controls allow you to selectively delete and ignore forever any item you prefer not be stored.\n\nHow long is your data retained?\n\nAll your data is destroyed in its entirety when you delete your account, except account activity logs required for business audit records. This process can take up to 3 days to protect against accidental deletion. Users can request immediate deletion by contacting support.\n\nYou can delete your own data at any time on our website in the Data & Privacy section of account settings.\n\nFree account user data older than 15 months is automatically deleted on a continuous basis.\n\nCookies and Log Files\n\nRescueTime.com sends a \"cookie\" to your computer that contains an identifier that is unique to your browser session. We use this cookie to validate your authentication, provide you with a continuous experience, and to record how our site/service is being used. It is not used for marketing purposes.\n\nAs is done with most web sites, we log each visit to each web page. A log entry can contain information typically found in the \"header\" of your web browser's request such as the browser type you used, your Internet Protocol address, and the date and time of day. We may also log your session identifier and the URL of a site that referred you. This log information is important for security, audit, quality improvement, as well as for monitoring the health of our service.",
      "# [RescueTime API Documentation](https://www.rescuetime.com/rtx/developers)\nConnecting to the RescueTime API\n\nThere are two ways to connect to a user’s data in RescueTime, via API Keys or via an Oauth2 Connection. The API keys are ideal for personal use, while web services wishing to offer a way for their users to use their RescueTime data should use an Oauth2 connection.\n\nAPI Key Access:\n\nUsers can set up an API key by going to their key management page and creating a new key. That key must be included with each API request. The user can revoke keys at any time.\n\nOauth2 Connection Access:\n\nPlease contact us and we’ll work with you to set up an Oauth2 application. After the user connects their account via Oauth2, an access token will be created. That access token must be included in each API request. The user can revoke access to a service at any time.\n\nOauth2 Authorization Flow\n\nOnce we have created your Oauth2 application, your app will be assigned a client_id and a client_secret. These tokens can then be used, along with the secure redirect_uri provided in the request for an oauth application, in the following steps to authorize your application's user access to their RescueTime data:\n\nA GET request to the following URL:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&response_type=code&scope=YOUR_SCOPES\n\nThis will return the auth_code, which will expire in 10 minutes.\n\nA POST request to the following URL:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/oauth/token\n\nwith a JSON body of:\n\n{\n\n\"client_id\": YOUR_CLIENT_ID,\n\n\"client_secret\": YOUR_APP_SECRET,\n\n\"grant_type\": \"authorization_code\",\n\n\"code\": AUTH_CODE,\n\n\"redirect_uri\": YOUR_REDIRECT_URI\n\n}\n\nThis will return the access_token\n\nData can then be accessed with the access_token, as shown in this example URL:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/data?access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN&by=interval&taxonomy=productivity&interval=hour&restrict_begin=2018-01-01&restrict_end=2018-01-31&format=json&scopes=time_data\n\nOauth2 Access Scopes\n\nWhen users connect their accounts to your application via Oauth2, you can specify access scopes to let the user know exactly how you will be using their RescueTime data. Scopes will be requested during the initial authorization request.\n\nThe following scopes are currently supported:\n\ntime_data: Access activity history and summary time data or post offline time for the authorized user\n\ncategory_data: Access how much time the authorizing user spent in specific categories\n\nproductivity_data: Access how much time the authorizing user spent in different productivity levels\n\nalert_data: Access the authorizing user's alert history\n\nhighlight_data: Read from and post to the authorizing user's daily highlights list\n\nfocustime_data: Access the authorizing user's Focus Session history and session starting and stopping\n\nAPI Endpoints\n\nThere are several API endpoints that can be used to access different types of data within RescueTime.\n\nAnalytic Data API:\n\nThe Analytic Data API is targeted at bringing developers the prepared and pre-organized data structures already familiar through the reporting views of www.rescuetime.com.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Analytic Data API\n\nDaily Summary Feed API:\n\nThe Daily Summary Feed API provides a structured rollup of daily data about the time logged by a user. This data includes: total time logged, time logged at each productivity level, average productivity pulse, and the time spent in each major category.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Daily Summary Feed API\n\nAlerts Feed API:\n\nThe Alerts Feed API provides a feed of recent occurrences of user-defined alerts. It is a good way to let users define aspects of their data that they care about (“I want to spend more than 5 hours per day on All Productive Time”, for example) and then use that data in an external service.\n\nNote: Alerts are a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return empty results for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Alerts Feed API\n\nHighlights Feed API:\n\nThe Highlights Feed API provides a feed of recently entered daily highlights.\n\nNote: Highlights are a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return empty results for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Highlights Feed API\n\nHighlights POST API:\n\nThe Highlights POST API allows users to post a daily highlight entry programatically. An example use case is posting a new highlight whenever a software developer makes a new check-in to their GIT repository.\n\nNote: Highlights are a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return a 400 response for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Highlights Post API\n\nFocus Session Trigger API:\n\nThe Focus Session Trigger API allows users to start Focus Session on their active devices programatically.\n\nNote: Focus Session is a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return a 400 response for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Focus Session Trigger API\n\nFocus Session Feed API:\n\nThe Focus Session Feed API provides a feed of recent Focus Session \"started\" or Focus Session \"ended\" events. An example use case would be to set a chat application status to \"away\" when a new Focus Session started event has been detected.\n\nNote: Focus Sessions are a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return a 400 response for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Focus Session Feed API\n\nOffline Time POST API:\n\nThe Offline Time POST API allows users to post offline time to their account programmatically. An example use case would be to post offline time based on localtion data or meeting times.\n\nNote: Offline Time is a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return a 400 response for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Offline Time Post API\n\nDocumentation for the Analytic Data API\n\nRescueTime data is detailed and complicated. The Analytic Data API is targeted at bringing developers the prepared and pre-organized data structures already familiar through the reporting views of www.rescuetime.com. The data is read-only through the webservice, but you can perform any manipulations on the consumer side you want. Keep in mind this is a draft interface, and may change in the future. We do intend to version the interfaces though, so it is likely forward compatible.\n\nThe Analytic Data API allows for parameterized access, which means you can change the subject and scope of data, and is especially targeted for developer use. The data can be accessed via the HTTP Query interface in several formats.\n\nThe Analytic Data API is presented as a read-only resource accessed by simple GET HTTP queries. This provides maximum flexibility with minimal complexity; you can use the provided API tools, or just research the documented parameters and construct your own queries.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach this HTTP query API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key: https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/data\n\nFor Oauth2 connections:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/data - This is the least restritive url and requires the time_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRestricted Report: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/overview_data - This url will restricts the output to top level category data only and requires the category_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRestricted Report: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/category_data - This url will restricts the output to sub-category data only and requires the category_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRestricted Report: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/productivity_data - This url will restricts the output to productivity data only and requires the productivity_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nAbout restricted reports: Restricted reports may be useful if your application requires a less-granular rollup of the data, such as the category view, but NOT the actual activities themselves. These restricted reports help ensure the user’s privacy, and may be a preferable option when asking them to link their accounts.\n\nRequired parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nformat - [ 'csv' | 'json' ]\n\nQuery Parameters\n\nPrimary names are chosen for human reading. The short names are for when GET query length is at a premium. The alias is for understanding roughly how it maps into the language used in reporting views, and our own internal nicknames.\n\nPrinciple name Short Alias Short Values Description perspectivepvbyby [ 'rank' | 'interval' ]\n\nConsider this the X - axis of the returned data. It is what determines how your data is crunched serverside for ordered return.\n\nrank: (default) Organized around a calculated value, usually a sum like time spent.\n\ninterval: Organized around calendar time.\n\nresolution_timersintervali [ 'month' | 'week' | 'day' | 'hour' | 'minute' ]\n\nDefault is \"hour\". In an interval report, the X axis unit. In other words, data is summarizd into chunks of this size. \"minute\" will return data grouped into five-minute buckets, which is the most granular view available.\n\nrestrict_beginrb date\n\nSets the start day for data batch, inclusive (always at time 00:00, start hour/minute not supported)\n\nFormat ISO 8601 \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n\nrestrict_endre date\n\nSets the end day for data batch, inclusive (always at time 00:00, end hour/minute not supported)\n\nFormat ISO 8601 \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n\nrestrict_kindrktaxonomyty [ 'category' | 'activity' | 'productivity' | 'document' ]\n\n('efficiency' is option when perspective is 'interval')\n\nAllows you to preprocess data through different statistical engines. The perspective dictates the main grouping of the data, this provides different aspects of that main grouping.\n\noverview: sums statistics for all activities into their top level category\n\ncategory: sums statistics for all activities into their sub category\n\nactivity: sums statistics for individual applications / web sites / activities\n\nproductivity: productivity calculation\n\nefficiency: efficiency calculation (not applicable in \"rank\" perspective)\n\ndocument: sums statistics for individual documents and web pages\n\nrestrict_thingrttaxontx name (of category, activity, or overview)\n\nThe name of a specific overview, category, application or website. For websites, use the domain component only if it starts with \"www\", eg. \"www.nytimes.com\" would be \"nytimes.com\".

It has these properties:\n\nnotes = String, a short explanation of the data envelope\n\nrow_headers = Array, a label for the contents of each index in a row, in the order they appear in row\n\nrows = Array X Array, an array of data rows, where each row is itself an array described by the row_headers\n\nExample Queries\n\nTo request information about the user's productivity levels, by hour, for the date of January 1, 2020:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/data?key=YOUR_API_KEY&perspective=interval&restrict_kind=productivity&interval=hour&restrict_begin=2020-01-01&restrict_end=2020-01-01&format=json\n\nTo request a list of time spent in each top level category, ranked by duration, for the date of January 1, 2020:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/data?key=YOUR_API_KEY&perspective=rank&restrict_kind=overview&restrict_begin=2020-01-01&restrict_end=2020-01-01&format=csv\n\nDocumentation for the Daily Summary Feed API\n\nThe Daily Summary Feed API provides a high level rollup of the the time a user has logged for a full 24 hour period (defined by the user’s selected time zone). This is useful for generating notifications that don’t need to be real-time and don’t require much granularity (for greater precision or more timely alerts, see the Alerts Feed API). This can be used to construct a customized daily progress report delivered via email. The summary can also be used to alert people to specific conditions. For example, if a user has more than 20% of their time labeled as ‘uncategorized’, that can be used to offer people a message to update their categorizations on the website.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The Daily Summary Feed is ‘point in time‘ data - use the data api or export CSVs from reports if you want your latest categorization results.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach this Daily Summary Feed API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key: https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/daily_summary_feed\n\nFor Oauth2 connections: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/daily_summary_feed\n\nRequired parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nOutput Format\n\nThe Daily Summary Feed API returns an array of JSON objects representing rollup information for each day logged by the user in the previous two weeks. It does not include the current day, and new summaries for the previous day are available at 12:01 am in the user’s local time zone. The returned value for each daily summary includes the following information:\n\nGeneral information\n\nid - Unix Timestamp representation of the date. Can use useful for deduplication of items in the feed.\n\ndate - Summary Date\n\nproductivity_pulse - Overall productivity pulse.

This is a good event-based representation of data that the user cares about. Alerts are a premium feature and as such the API will always return zero results for users on the RescueTime Lite plan.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach the Alerts Feed API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key: https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/alerts_feed\n\nFor Oauth2 connections: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/alerts_feed - Requires the alert_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRequired parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nop - [ status | list ]\n\nThe op parameter determines what type of information about the alerts is returned. Passing op=list will return a definition list of all the alerts currently defined by the user. This is useful for presenting a list of the user's alerts to allow the user to select an alert_id value that will be used to filter subsequent queries.\n\nPassing op a value of status is the default, and will return a list of recently triggered alerts in reverse-chronological order.\n\nOptional parameters\n\nalert_id - [ Integer ID of an alert to filter on ]\n\nOutput Format\n\nWhen passing op=list, The Alerts Feed API will return an array of JSON objects representing the currently active alerts that the user has defined. Each alert object has the following structure:\n\n{\n\n'id': integer (Unique id of the user-defined alert, can be used for filtering the triggered alerts),\n\n'description': string (The string representation of the alert definition),\n\n'amount': float (the number of hours the user has defined for this alert’s threshold)\n\n}\n\nWhen passing op=status, the feed returns an array of JSON objects representing the actual triggering of alerts in reverse chronological order. Each object has the following structure:\n\n{\n\n'id': integer (Unique id for the occurence of the alert triggering),\n\n'alert_id': integer (Unique id of the user-defined alert, can be used to filter alerts),\n\n'description': string (The message generated by the triggered alert),\n\n'created_at': datetime (The time, in user’s selected time zone, that the alert was triggered)\n\n}\n\nExample Queries\n\nTo request a list of for the user's active alerts:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/alerts_feed?key=YOUR_API_KEY&op=list\n\nTo request a list of alert 12345 being triggered for the user:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/alerts_feed?key=YOUR_API_KEY&op=status&alert_id=12345\n\nDocumentation for the Highlights Feed API\n\nThe Highlights Feed API is a list of recently entered Daily Highlight events. These are user-entered strings that are meant to provide qualitative context for the automatically logged time about the user’s activities. It is often used to keep a log of “what got done today”. Highlights are a premium feature and as such the API will always return zero results for users on the RescueTime Lite plan.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach the Highlights Feed API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key: https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/highlights_feed\n\nFor Oauth2 connections: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/highlights_feed - Requires the highlight_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRequired parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nOutput Format\n\nThe Highlights Feed API returns an array of JSON objects representing the highlights that have been entered by a user. The returned value for each highlight has the following structure:\n\n{\n\n'id': integer (Unique id to trigger off of, useful for polling for new items),\n\n'description': string (The text of the highlight),\n\n'date': date (Date that the highlight was entered for, may be different than created_at),\n\n'created_at': datetime (Timestamp when the highlight was entered)\n\n}\n\nExample Queries\n\nTo request a list of for the user's recently entered daily highlights:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/highlights_feed?key=YOUR_API_KEY\n\nDocumentation for the FocusTime Feed API\n\nThe FocusTime Feed API is a running log of recently triggered started/ended FocusTime sessions. This is useful for performing 3rd party app interactions whenever a new FocusTime session has started/ended. FocusTime is a premium feature and as such the API will always return zero results for users on the RescueTime Lite plan.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach the FocusTime Feed API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/focustime_started_feed\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/focustime_ended_feed\n\nFor Oauth2 connections:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/focustime_started_feed\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/focustime_ended_feed\n\n- Requires the focustime_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRequired parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nOutput Format\n\nThe FocusTime Feed API returns an array of JSON objects representing the FocusTime started/ended events in reverse chronological order. Each object has the following structure:\n\n{\n\n'id': float (A UNIX timestamp that represents a unique id for the event),\n\n'duration': integer (The initial length of time in minutes for the FocusTime Session, focustime_started_feed only),\n\n'created_at': datetime (The time, in user’s selected time zone, that the session was started)\n\n}\n\nExample Queries\n\nTo request a list of recent FocusTime started Events:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/focustime_started_feed?key=YOUR_API_KEY\n\nDocumentation for the Offline Time POST API\n\nThe Offline Time Post API makes it possible to post offline time programmatically as an alternative to entering it manually on RescueTime.com. This is useful for capturing information from other systems. Examples include adding offline time after a meeting on a calendar app, or logging driving time based on location data.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach Offline Time POST API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key: https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/offline_time_post\n\nFor Oauth2 connections: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/offline_time_post - Requires the time_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nNote: A POST request must be used for this API. Also, offline time posts via the API are limited to a 4 hour maximum duration, and they can not be created for future dates.\n\nRequired QUERY parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nRequired JSON keys/values\n\nstart_time - A string representing the date/time the for the start of the offline time block. This should be in the format of ‘YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS’, but a unix timestamp is also acceptable.\n\nend_time/duration - Either a string representing the date/time the for the end of the offline time block, OR an integer representing the duration of the offline time block in minutes.\n\nactivity_name - A 255 character or shorter string containing the text that will be entered as the name of the activity (e.g. \"Meeting\", \"Driving\", \"Sleeping\", etc).\n\nOptional JSON keys/values\n\nactivity_details - A 255 character or shorter string containing the text that will be entered as the details of the named activity.\n\nOutput Format\n\nA successful post will return at status code of 200. If there is an error, a status code of 400 will be returned.\n\nExample Requests\n\nTo post offline time about a meeting that just ended:\n\nA POST request to the following URL:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/offline_time_post?key=YOUR_API_KEY\n\nwith a JSON body of:\n\n{\n\n\"start_time\": \"2020-01-01 09:00:00\",\n\n\"duration\": 60,\n\n\"activity_name\": \"Meeting\",\n\n\"activity_details\": \"Daily Planning\"\n\n}\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\nWhen you enable access to your data, you generate a key that is saved in RescueTime's system. Essentially, this key provides an alternative read-only authentication to your data. You can keep this key private, in which case it's just as safe as your login and password, or publish it, without exposing your account to other access or risks beyond the scope of the data.\n\nWe assume data api access is being requested for use on the server side of things, presumably in some code of your own. In this case, you can protect the key as you would any other server side secret. It would never be seen in the browser, but used by your application to retrieve data from us then process and render yourself somehow. So in this case, the key provides read-only access to your data by arbitrary scope (within limits) through parameters.\n\nAs a user, you can revoke access to keys you have created by going to your Key Management Page. Any applications you have connected to via an Oauth2 connection, can be revoked by going to your connected applications page.",

Unfortunately I had to request a refund because currently they don't track correctly subdomains, and this is a crucial feature for me.",

Which programs do I spend my time on, which websites I visit, which documents I look at, etc.\n\nRescue time is great, but it's locked to this dumb \"productivity\" focus. Things are \"productive\", \"distracting\" or \"neutral\". And I don't particularly care about that. I want to get a good overview of how I spend my time as a big picture, **without that forced categorization**, so that I can start to figure out my baseline. This is because I want to use this for personal use, not for office work.

Hell, I can't even make a category for \"Studying\".\n\nI don't really mind if it an alternative is paid or subscription based, as long as it's not too crazy.

Everything is stored locally on your PC and you can also access the raw data.\nIf you're into deeper tinkering, you could also create your personal activity watchers.\n\n### Comment ID fqu1p78 with +1 score by [(H0lley, Reddit, 2020-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DopamineDetoxing/comments/gktick/alternatives_to_rescuetime/fqu1p78/) (in reply to ID fqtugdl):\nthis looks very promising. might be exactly what I've been looking for. thanks!",

It doesn't recognise Firefox, Libre Office, or anything else. Two other strange features (related to each other): in contrast to how it used to work, rescutime recognises all Zoom activity (i.e. the fact that the client is running in the background, a chat window opening, my settings dialogue, and so on) -- this means that it thinks that I am on Zoom all the time; related to this, no doubt, is the fact that it no longer recognises when I am away from the computer (presumably because it thinks I am on Zoom).\n\nI suspect that the problem is that xprop the Process Name, ID, and Window title commands don't work anymore: i.e. \n\nxprop -id \\`xprop -root | grep \"\\_NET\\_ACTIVE\\_WINDOW(WINDOW)\" | cut -d# -f2 | cut -d, -f1\\` | grep \"NET\\_WM\\_PID\" | cut -d\"=\" -f2 2>/dev/null\n\nxprop -id \\`xprop -root 2>/dev/null | grep \"\\_NET\\_ACTIVE\\_WINDOW(WINDOW)\" | cut -d# -f2 | cut -d, -f1\\` 2>/dev/null | grep \"WM\\_CLASS(STRING)\" | cut -d\"\\\\\"\" -f4 2>/dev/null\n\nxprop -id \\`xprop -root 2>/dev/null | grep \"\\_NET\\_ACTIVE\\_WINDOW(WINDOW)\" | cut -d# -f2 | cut -d, -f1\\` 2>/dev/null | grep \"WM\\_NAME(STRING)\\\\|WM\\_NAME(COMPOUND\\_TEXT)\" | cut -d\"\\\\\"\" -f2 2>/dev/null\n\nThe first command produces an error: \n\nxprop: error: Invalid window id format: 0x0\n\nThe other two produce nothing.\n\nAny suggestions?

Enterprise ready competitors are price gauging your opportunities and offering more robust technology that meets modern SaaS use-case scenarios. \n\nMiddle management is filled with projects that could be executed around actually customer and employee needs and employees in the Sales and marketing departments are more than aware of pain-points that causing their day-to-day to become increasingly difficult as Covid prevention and back to office work becomes more prevalent. Evolve to meet the true needs of your customers.",

Former competitors took advantage of this and reduced their monthly and annual pricing agreements - while offering the same technology that Time Doctor had been known to have for the longest time in this SaaS space. Now current integrations offer time tracking reports as an extension of their product suite - or even free - and revenues are hurting because of this. \n\nFeedback on the reduction of macros has led to C-Level leadership making shorthanded decisions that directly impact employees and their compensation, as well as, the end-users of the platform (consistent changes in their pricing agreements and product offerings based on tiers). \n\nThe direction of change does not equate to the customers needs - nor does leadership ask the end-users for their feedback. Middle management and their amazing ideas for changes based on client and employee feedback is lengthened due to this leadership structure. \n\nSpecial projects that impact company growth are “A/B tested” for a considerable amount of time, until they are ignored. Sales and Revenue generation is left to two outlets of opportunity generation - third party webinars not hosted by the organization internally & the free trial that is always “glowing” for access on the homepage. \n\nIt is sad to see so many talented and truly GOOD people become frustrated with their day to day and become overall disinterested with the value proposition that the product offers. The creative aesthetic of middle management depreciates every day, due to this.",

This inherent challenge for remote workers may require ongoing strategies to maintain a healthy balance.\n\nGlobal Operations: Working across different time zones and cultures can occasionally lead to scheduling conflicts or misunderstandings that require patience and adaptability.\n\nHigh Expectations: With a focus on innovation and growth, there may be high expectations for performance, requiring dedication and resilience from employees.\n\nDespite these considerations, Time Doctor remains a rewarding and dynamic place to work, with ample opportunities for personal and professional development.",

Enterprise ready competitors are price gauging your opportunities and offering more robust technology that meets modern SaaS use-case scenarios. \n\nMiddle management is filled with projects that could be executed around actually customer and employee needs and employees in the Sales and marketing departments are more than aware of pain-points that causing their day-to-day to become increasingly difficult as Covid prevention and back to office work becomes more prevalent. Evolve to meet the true needs of your customers.",

Former competitors took advantage of this and reduced their monthly and annual pricing agreements - while offering the same technology that Time Doctor had been known to have for the longest time in this SaaS space. Now current integrations offer time tracking reports as an extension of their product suite - or even free - and revenues are hurting because of this. \n\nFeedback on the reduction of macros has led to C-Level leadership making shorthanded decisions that directly impact employees and their compensation, as well as, the end-users of the platform (consistent changes in their pricing agreements and product offerings based on tiers). \n\nThe direction of change does not equate to the customers needs - nor does leadership ask the end-users for their feedback. Middle management and their amazing ideas for changes based on client and employee feedback is lengthened due to this leadership structure. \n\nSpecial projects that impact company growth are “A/B tested” for a considerable amount of time, until they are ignored. Sales and Revenue generation is left to two outlets of opportunity generation - third party webinars not hosted by the organization internally & the free trial that is always “glowing” for access on the homepage. \n\nIt is sad to see so many talented and truly GOOD people become frustrated with their day to day and become overall disinterested with the value proposition that the product offers.

      "# [The 8 best apps to help you focus and block distractions in 2024 by Justin Pot on 2018-12-04](https://zapier.com/blog/stay-focused-avoid-distractions/)\nI find it hard to get work done while watching movies, visiting theme parks, or hanging out with my friends. So why do I think I can get work done online?\n\nYes, the internet is a place where work happens, but distractions are always a click away. You could say this is a matter of discipline, and it is, but the odds aren't in your favor. The internet is, at this point, a dopamine slot machine. The greatest minds of our generation are working around the clock to \"increase engagement,\" which is a tech term that means \"getting you to spend every waking moment scrolling and liking things.\" Trying to fight this with willpower alone is like bringing a water gun to a thermonuclear war.\n\nWhich is why there's no shame in using tools to help you build discipline. This is where distraction blocking software shines. Turn these focus apps on, and you can't open anything distracting—it won't work. Instead, you'll see a reminder that you set up software to block apps, and you'll be encouraged to get back to work. It's oddly liberating.\n\nI've been updating this list every year for several years, and this year, after testing all the top focus apps out there, I found some new options. With that, here are the best focus apps.\n\nThe 8 best focus apps\n\nFreedom for blocking distractions on all your devices at once\n\nCold Turkey Blocker for scheduled system-wide blocking\n\nLeechBlock NG for free browser-based website blocking\n\nRescueTime for time tracking with built-in website blocking\n\nSelfControl for a nuclear option\n\nSession for a combination Pomodoro timer and distraction blocker\n\none sec for adding a little friction to every distraction\n\nPawBlock for distraction blocking with cute animal pictures\n\nWhat is a focus app?\n\nI've written about productivity, in some form, since 2009, and have been very public about my personal productivity struggles over the years. Which is probably why I've tested just about every distraction blocker that's come out in that time, and relied on them to get things done for over a decade.\n\nDon't confuse website blocker apps with parental control software—that's not what they're for. No, these tools are for you, and they hopefully help you build better habits. I researched this category extensively and considered dozens of options, then evaluated them against my criteria. I think that the best distraction blocking apps should do the following:\n\nBlock a list of websites and/or apps (determined by you)\n\nAllow you to set a schedule and/or a timer\n\nBe annoying (at the very least) to disable\n\nOffer encouragement\n\nIn addition, because I'm thinking about productivity at work, I only considered apps that work on computers—there are no mobile-only tools here. Based on my experience testing dozens of different options, here's the focusing software I think works best.\n\nThe best focus apps at a glance\n\nBest focus app for blocking distractions on all your devices at once\n\nFreedom (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Chrome)\n\nFreedom pros:\n\nBlocks distractions on all your devices\n\nSupport for multiple blocklists\n\nOptional focus sounds\n\nFreedom cons:\n\nNo free version of the full product\n\nSetup takes a little time and can be confusing\n\nMost distraction blockers work only on whatever device you're using right now. Freedom can block distractions—both websites and apps—on all of your devices, simultaneously. No more blocking Instagram on your computer, only to immediately open it on your phone. If you start a session, your distractions are blocked everywhere.\n\nSet up as many blocklists as you want, then start or schedule a session. There's a lockdown mode, which makes it impossible to edit your blocklists while a session is active—consider that if you're prone to working around your own good intentions. There are also optional focus sounds, which are basically ambient background noise from coffee shops or nature.\n\nThe downside: there's no long-term free version. But if you don't want to pay, you're not out of luck: Freedom offers a few free Chrome extensions. There's Pause, which will delay distracting sites from opening; Limit, which will cap how much time you can spend on distracting sites; Insight, which tells you how much time you're spending online; and Focus, which is built for students and blocks all non-educational websites.\n\nFreedom pricing: $3.33/month billed annually or $8.99/month billed monthly; $199 for a lifetime subscription\n\nBest app blocker for scheduled system-wide blocking\n\nCold Turkey Blocker (Windows, macOS)\n\nCold Turkey Blocker pros:\n\nExtremely customizable\n\nFrozen Turkey feature locks you out of your computer entirely\n\nNo subscription for full version\n\nCold Turkey Blocker cons:\n\nCan be a little tricky to set up\n\nCold Turkey Blocker is, in a word, customizable. Install this site-blocking app, and you can create lists of websites and desktop apps to block, then set a schedule for blocking. You could, for example, block social media and video sites during every work day. You could also block work apps, like Slack, when the work day ends. It's all up to you. Or, if you prefer, you can turn blocking on and off manually. There's even a mode called Frozen Turkey, which prevents you from accessing your computer entirely: turn on Frozen Turkey, and you won't be able to log in to your computer without it locking again.\n\nBecause this is a system-wide tool and not just a browser extension, you can't work around it by changing browsers. But it goes further than that—there are all kinds of settings that thwart future versions of yourself from working around your current intentions.\n\nYou can block the Time & Language settings, stopping you from working around a scheduled block by changing your computer's time. You can stop yourself from accessing the Chromium Task Manager, which you could, in theory, use to disable the blocking extension. You can even make it impossible to uninstall Cold Turkey Blocker until your scheduled blocking is complete. I could go on, but the basic point is that you can stop yourself from working around your block. Try this out if you're the self-sabotaging sort.\n\nCold Turkey pricing: $39 one-time purchase for Pro, which offers unlimited blocking, scheduling, and the ability to block desktop apps as well as websites\n\nBest free browser-based website blocker\n\nLeechBlock NG (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera)\n\nLeechBlock pros:\n\nCompletely free\n\nWorks in all major browsers\n\nVery quick to set up\n\nLeechBlock cons:\n\nCan't block desktop apps\n\nNo mobile version\n\nLeechBlock NG (the NG stands for \"next generation\") works on most major browsers, is free, and gives you a bunch of options for blocking distractions. You can make lists of sites to block, then restrict them in all kinds of ways.\n\nYou can schedule times for apps to be blocked outright, which is very straightforward. Alternatively, you can limit your time on distracting apps by setting up rules. For example: you could give yourself 20 minutes of YouTube time every day, or four minutes of Twitter every hour. You can get even more specific, if you want, combining time limits with a schedule—think five minutes of Instagram every hour between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Or, if you don't want to mess with schedules, you can trigger a one-off \"lockdown\" schedule.\n\nIt's a lot of power, particularly for a free tool, and you can even lock down the settings during block sessions if you want. The only downside: this is a browser extension, not an app, so you can work around it by switching browsers. If you can avoid that temptation, though, LeechBlock should work nicely.\n\nLeechBlock pricing: Free\n\nBest focus app for time tracking with built-in website blocking\n\nRescueTime (Windows, macOS, Android, iPhone, iPad)\n\nRescueTime pros:\n\nComplete time tracking software with built-in distraction blocking\n\nUses the list of distracting apps you've already added there\n\nRescueTime cons:\n\nBlocking features are a little buried inside RescueTime's feature set\n\nRescueTime isn't, primarily, a distraction blocker—it's one of the best time tracking apps. But it does include a distraction blocking feature called Focus Session, so you can block distractions using your time tracking history.\n\nThis works using data you're already providing RescueTime, which allows you to designate apps and websites into three categories: focus work, other work, and personal activities. These lists are pre-populated when you set up an account and you can also customize them.\n\nDuring Focus Sessions, you can block everything but focus work or, if you prefer, just block personal activities. It's a great way to block distractions without having to build a separate block list, particularly if you're looking for a time tracking app anyway.\n\nYou can also use RescueTime to block distractions automatically using RescueTime's Zapier integrations. That way, you can do things like schedule a daily Focus Session or automatically start Focus Sessions when you start a timer in another app.\n\nRescueTime pricing: $12/month or $78/year; note that the free version of RescueTime does not include distraction blocking\n\nBest focus app for a nuclear option for Mac users\n\nSelfControl (Mac)\n\nSelfControl pros:\n\nImpossible to disable once you've set it\n\nSelfControl cons:\n\nCan only block URLs\n\nOnly for macOS\n\nSelfControl looks spartan: there's a blocklist, a dial for setting how long your block period should be, and a start button. That's it. But it stands out for one key reason: it's impossible to undo.\n\nSeriously, this app is hardcore. Closing the app does nothing—all of your distractions are still blocked. Deleting the app doesn't do anything, and neither does rebooting your computer. The only way to disable blocking, once you set the timer, is to reinstall macOS entirely (which would delete all of your apps, settings, and documents).\n\nIt is truly the nuclear option for blocking distractions—none of the other apps on this list come close to this level of permanence. If you're the sort of person who starts blocking, then caves, this app is for you.\n\nSelfControl pricing: Free\n\nBest distraction blocker and Pomodoro timer combination\n\nSession (macOS, iOS)\n\nSession pros:\n\nBuilt-in Pomodoro timer\n\nGreat integration options\n\nSession cons:\n\nVery expensive for this type of app\n\nPomodoro timers are built on a simple premise: the best focusing happens if you take regular breaks. These timers are generally set up for you to focus on tasks for 25 minutes, followed by a five-minute break. It logically follows, then, that you might want distracting apps and websites blocked when you intend to focus. Session, which is on Zapier's list of the best Pomodoro timers, can also block distractions.\n\nYou can choose which apps and websites should be blocked while you're focusing—the blocks will automatically engage during your work sessions and turn off during your breaks. You can even block productivity apps when you're supposed to be taking a break, if you want.\n\nThere are all kinds of great features for power users to dig into here. You can, for example, trigger a custom Apple Shortcut every time you start or end a session. You can integrate the time with your calendar, allowing you to see what's coming up. There's even a Slack integration, allowing you to mute entire teams while you're focusing. There's a lot to like here, and only one main downside: it's pretty expensive.\n\nSession price: Free basic app; from $4.99/month for Monthly Pro, or get it as part of Setapp for $10/month with 230 other Mac apps.\n\nBest focus app for adding a little friction to every distraction\n\none sec (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Android, iOS)\n\none sec pros:\n\nDelays distracting sites and apps from opening\n\nPrompts you to think about your impulsive distractions\n\none sec cons:\n\nNo support for desktop apps\n\nNo scheduling feature\n\nMost of the apps on this list block distractions outright. Not this app: one sec makes you take a pause. Attempt to open a site or app you've indicated is a distraction, and one one sec will encourage you to take a breath, complete with an animation. It will then show you how many times you've attempted to open that distraction before allowing you to decide whether you do or don't want to open it.\n\nThe app is doing a number of things here. First, it's forcing you to slow down. Second, it's showing you just how often you reflexively open sites you find distracting. These two things, combined, can go a long way toward helping you with your goal of spending less time feeling distracted. If apps that outright block websites don't work for you, give one sec a try—you might be surprised.\n\none sec pricing: Starting at $2.99/month, up to $39.99 for a lifetime plan\n\nBest distraction blocking app with cute animal pictures\n\nPawBlock (Chrome, Firefox)\n\nPawBlock pros:\n\nAnimal photos\n\nDo you really need anything else?\n\nPawBlock cons:\n\nNo mobile or desktop version (but still: animal pictures)\n\nPawBlock isn't nearly as customizable as the other browser-based option on this list, but it's got one thing going for it: animals. If you visit a distracting website, you'll see a cute animal who's disappointed with your choices. Decide to leave that site, and you'll see a happy animal. It's manipulative, yes, but it also works.\n\nBy default, there's a \"soft\" block, which shows you the sad animal picture but allows you to decide whether or not you want to visit the distracting site after you wait a certain number of seconds. This means you'll have to actively decide to scroll through Twitter, instead of doing so reflexively. You can change this to a hard block—which doesn't allow you to visit the distractions—if you'd rather remove temptations entirely. All of this adds up to a useful tool for changing your own habits, even if it's relatively easy to work around.\n\nPlus: animal pictures. I really don't feel like I need to justify this any more than saying that.\n\nPawBlock pricing: Free\n\nWhat's the best focus app?\n\nThe best focus app is the one that helps you focus—that's all it comes down to. If you're just starting out with focus apps, give one of the free apps (LeechBlock, SelfControl, or PawBlock) a try. Figure out what features you like most and what's missing from the experience, and then read through the rest of the options to find the one that will work best for you.\n\nRelated reading:\n\nHow to use the Flowtime Technique to boost your productivity\n\nHow to add focus time in Google Calendar—and why you should\n\nPick one priority every week, and focus on it",
      "# [RescueTime Review to Create Timesheets in 2024 by Engineering Team on 2024-02-23](https://clickup.com/blog/rescuetime-review/)\nTime is the only resource you can’t make more of. Streamlining your to-do list can certainly help, but when you’re sending out a time management SOS, you need a tool like RescueTime to throw you a life preserver.\n\nTime-tracking software is a must-have for true productivity, and that’s where RescueTime comes in. It functions as a time tracker and timesheet tool with a dose of structure, insight, and helpful but pesky reminders to keep you on track. 🏃\n\nLike any productivity tool, RescueTime has its pros and cons. If you aren’t sure whether it’s worth your time (see what we did there?), check out this RescueTime app review. We’ll explain how RescueTime works, its pros, cons, and pricing. Plus, we’ll share a great alternative to RescueTime if you decide it’s not your thing. Let’s get to it!\n\nWhat Is RescueTime?\n\nRescueTime is a time-tracking tool designed to help you master time management. Sure, it tracks your time, but this all-in-one productivity tool does more than that. It provides comprehensive insights into how you spend your time.\n\nWhether you’re a freelancer who needs to create accurate timesheets or a team leader who needs to boost productivity levels, RescueTime offers the insights you need to set and meet goals. 🏅\n\nThe tool runs quietly in the background on your computer or mobile device, whether it’s Windows, Mac, iOS, or Android, gathering data on your activity. It then compiles this data into detailed reports and graphs showcasing your most productive times, distracting websites, and how you distributed work hours between tasks.\n\nRescueTime is different than other productivity and time-tracking tools because it gives you a productivity score (which it calls the productivity pulse). This score measures how efficiently you use your time. You can also set goals for your focus time and block distractions to stay in the zone.\n\nKey RescueTime Features\n\nThere’s a lot to love about RescueTime. Compared to competitors like Toggl and Clockify, it offers a more robust way to track your time and improve time management. Optimize your work hours and say bye-bye to distractions with RescueTime’s time-saving features.\n\n1. Focus Sessions\n\nRescueTime’s main feature is Focus Session, a Pomodoro-like work sesh where you set aside a block of time for focused work. The goal is to get into a mental flow state by mono-tasking, which is the key to real productivity. 🧠\n\nWe like that RescueTime doesn’t just throw you into a Focus Session. Their setup wizard takes you through a helpful prep session that includes a body check-in, reminding you to go to the bathroom or grab water. RescueTime also asks you to go through a quick mental reset, take a deep breath, and commit to your Focus Session before you click the “start” button.\n\nUsers say they like the prep checklist and the Focus Sessions themselves. You’re free to customize the session however you see fit. For example, RescueTime integrates with Spotify to personalize the experience without opening another app.\n\nAlso, every Focus Session tells you how many other workers are in Focus Sessions worldwide in real time. Body doubling, or feeling more motivated when someone works alongside you (in person or virtually), helps you get even more out of these Focus Sessions.\n\n2. RescueTime Assistant and AI (beta)\n\nAll RescueTime accounts come with an Assistant, which gives you a customized morning forecast of the day’s meetings and to-dos. Not only that, but the RescueTime Assistant also looks at your schedule and tells you the best time for focused work in between meetings and events. 🔎\n\nThis feature is still in beta, but RescueTime is also rolling out an AI-powered assistant. Currently available only for timesheets, the AI automatically divides time between projects and clients, improving the accuracy of your time-tracking. However, the AI needs a lot of data to do this for you, so set aside plenty of time to train the model.\n\n3. Distraction alerts and blocking\n\nHow often have you sat down intending to work, only to find yourself scrolling through Instagram? It happens to the best of us. 🙈\n\nSometimes, you need to take care of business, and in a world where distractions are just a tap away, you need to take more extreme measures.\n\nWhat sets RescueTime apart from other time-tracking apps is its ability to block distractions. Tell it which apps or websites are your Kryptonite, and it will block them during every Focus Session.\n\nIf you “forget” and try to access distracting websites anyway, you’ll get a pop-up from RescueTime displaying your timer, time management goals, and a healthy guilt trip to remind you to return to work. 👀\n\n4. RescueTime community sessions\n\nRescueTime is a wiz at implementing body doubling. For extra motivation, join one of its community Focus Sessions. These are Pomodoro-style one-hour or two-hour Focus Sessions happening live worldwide.\n\nIf you don’t want to join the all-hands-on-deck RescueTime sessions, you can always create a shared space with coworkers, colleagues, or strangers while you work. This tricks your brain into thinking other people are holding you accountable and working alongside you, which works wonders for productivity.\n\n5. Time metrics\n\nAwareness is a great time management technique. At the end of every Focus Session, RescueTime will send you detailed reports and graphs illustrating your productivity pulse.\n\nThese reports break down your activities into categories such as “very productive,” “productive,” and “distracting,” allowing you to see where your time is going at a glance. RescueTime will even rank your distractions so you can pinpoint the culprits more quickly. 📌\n\nRescueTime Pricing\n\nFree version\n\nMonthly: $12/month\n\nAnnually: $6.50/month, billed annually for $78\n\nPros of Using RescueTime\n\nChoosing RescueTime as your go-to time-tracking tool comes with plenty of benefits. While RescueTime might not be right for everyone, loyal fans love the app for several reasons.\n\nImproved self-awareness\n\nRescueTime’s metrics, notifications, and distraction reminders make you more aware of your daily routine. Its detailed reports clarify how you spend time, making it easier to identify bad habits and spot opportunities for improvement. It might sting a little to get a slap on the wrist for goofing off when you’re supposed to be working, but it’s all for the sake of boosting your productivity.\n\nFewer distractions\n\nOther time management tools might say, “Hey, you’re distracted!” However, RescueTime takes things a step further by literally blocking distractions. 🛑\n\nIt blocks distracting websites and apps during your designated focus time so you can preserve concentration. This feature is heaven-sent for anyone easily sidetracked by social media and other online distractions, ensuring you give your undivided attention to the most important tasks.\n\nAutomation\n\nRescueTime also has an automatic time-tracking feature that eliminates manual time entries, boosting the accuracy of your timesheets. That’s particularly helpful for freelancers who must provide precise time reports to clients or teams needing to track project management progress.\n\nGoal-setting\n\nRescueTime differs from other solutions because it allows you to set and achieve goals in record time. Set goals for your productive time and get alerts to stay on track. It’s fully customizable, too, so you’re free to make the platform your own.\n\nSmart integrations\n\nRescueTime eliminates the headaches of hopping back and forth between solutions, tools, and platforms. Integrate it with Slack, your calendar, or other project management software to streamline your workflow.\n\nCommon Pain Points RescueTime Users Face\n\nAs much as folks love RescueTime, it has a few setbacks. Users commonly mention these pain points.\n\nLots and lots of data\n\nRescueTime can initially seem overwhelming. It generates impressive data about your habits, but it takes time to make sense of the detailed reports. Like any platform, new users frequently complain about RescueTime’s learning curve. Take time to familiarize yourself with the dashboard and reports and learn how to interpret your metrics correctly. 📈\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\nRescueTime tracks everything you do across all of your tracked devices. Some users rightfully worry about privacy, especially regarding tracking features like screenshots or detailed logs of the websites they visit. RescueTime has robust privacy policies for data governance, but you need to give up some privacy to get the full benefit of the platform.\n\nLimited free features\n\nThe free version of RescueTime doesn’t have the advanced features you’ll get in RescueTime Premium. You won’t have as much freedom to customize goals, block distractions, or generate in-depth reports, which can be a drawback for anyone on a budget. 💸\n\nSyncing issues\n\nYou’ll probably see syncing issues using RescueTime across multiple devices, like your desktop and phone. There are occasional delays or inconsistencies between the desktop and mobile apps, which could give you an inaccurate picture of your productivity.\n\nRescueTime Reviews on Reddit\n\nWhat do the people of the internet really think about RescueTime? We took to Reddit to weigh the good, the bad, and the ugly of this productivity tool.\n\nSome users say RescueTime does a great job, but several had issues with the price of RescueTime Premium ($78 annually). They also mentioned they didn’t think the premium version was much better than the free version.\n\nOther users noticed RescueTime had some pretty big time-tracking discrepancies. “ActivityWatch tracked 17m; Rescuetime said I spent only 8 minutes, which is wrong by a margin. Also, note that they haven’t made significant changes to the Windows app since 2020/05/19. Like WHAT?” one user said.\n\nSome folks said the free version worked just fine, while others liked the premium features but not the premium price. Many users mentioned switching to RescueTime alternatives because of tracking discrepancies and out-of-date apps.\n\nRescueTime has much going for it, but it isn’t the be-all, end-all. This time log tool lacks many features, so you’ll likely still be flipping between different tools to do your work.\n\nEnter ClickUp, an alternative productivity and work management platform that offers time tracking, project management, and much more. 🎯\n\nSmart project time tracking\n\nHow much time do you spend on each project, task, or client? You’ll never know for sure without ClickUp project time tracking.\n\nThis project time-tracking features allow you to track time, create estimates, add notes, and more. Whether it’s the free Chrome extension, mobile app, or desktop site, you get an accurate view of your work in a single report. 📝\n\nSpeaking of reports, ClickUpTime Tracking cards are perfect for monitoring timesheets, estimates, billing, and more. Build a custom dashboard with Time Tracking cards of your choice to get a high-level view of your most important productivity metrics in one place.\n\nSolid time management\n\nTime tracking is one thing—time management is another beast entirely. That’s why ClickUp also includes tools for time management and goal-setting. Add time estimates to any task or split time between team members to manage expectations and keep your team on task.\n\nIf you’re a visual worker, ClickUp also has something for that. Toggle between Calendar view, Gantt view, Timeline view, or Workload view for a bird’s-eye look at what’s on your plate. 🤩\n\nTime-saving templates\n\nHey, do you know what RescueTime doesn’t have? Templates.\n\nGuess what ClickUp has? Templates by the pound!\n\nYou’re in the driver’s seat with ClickUp. Pull a template and customize it to meet your team’s time-tracking needs. For example, the ClickUp Services Timesheet Template allows team members to track work hours weekly. ⏳\n\nMoreover, the ClickUp Time Management Schedule Template is helpful for organizing your schedule and examining how you spend time.\n\nClickUp pricing\n\nFree Forever\n\nUnlimited: $7/month per user\n\nBusiness: $12/month per user\n\nEnterprise: Contact for pricing\n\nClickUp Brain: Available on all paid plans for $5/Workspace member/month\n\nSimplify Activity Tracking With ClickUp\n\nWe could all do with some extra time. But you can’t create more time, which is why maximizing your time at work is so important. The RescueTime app is a popular solution for time-strapped professionals, but it still requires hopping from platform to platform to do your actual work.\n\nClickUp is a true all-in-one solution for tracking both connected and offline time. Whether you’re a solo freelancer or a manager overseeing dozens of employees, ClickUp equips your team with the tools to do better work faster. ✨\n\nSee the difference for yourself: Create your free ClickUp Workspace now.",
      "# [Show HN: Rem: Remember Everything (open source)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38787892)\nThis does look cool. It reminds me of a recent discovery I made. The other day, while trying to recover some disk space, I found a giant file on my hard disk. It turned out to be a nine-hour screen recording from almost a year ago. I had no idea it existed, so I must’ve accidentally left the screen recording on. Scrubbing through it sped up, watching the whole thing in a couple minutes, was fascinating; it was like a window into my thought process at that time. You could see how I was researching something online. It was almost like a play-by-play, akin to re-watching a sports performance – very instructive and surprisingly useful.\n\nAlso, the the sense of being back in that time seeing details that I otherwise probably would’ve forgotten was transformative.\n\nIn a similar vein to what you’ve done, but focusing specifically on web browsing, I’ve created a tool called ‘DownloadNet.’ It archives for offline use and fully indexes every page you visit. Additionally, it can be configured to archive only the pages you bookmark, offering another mode of operation. It’s an open-source tool, so feel free to check it out: https://github.com/dosyago/DownloadNet\n\nthanks for checking it out, sure: some of the ways people are using it follow below.\n\n- reverse-proxy to protect proprietary code on your website from being inspected\n\n- content accelerator (similar to mightyapp's original idea) where it's faster to render pages on a cloud vps with thick bandwidth than it is on a local device (in some cases at least!), and depending on the usage profile, it's even cheaper to serve that bandwidth, especially if you use additional video codecs.\n\n- a framework to deliver web data collection and automation, agent authoring and intervention tooling on any device with no download\n\n- cors-proxy to include and access content across domains for building design and test tools saas\n\n- co-browsing for customer training and demonstration\n\nand then there's the many cybersecurity and privacy ways including:\n\n- standard remote browser isolation to isolate your device from zero day threats (an extra couple layers, requiring an even longer exploit chain, of protection, at least)\n\n- to aid compliance and privacy by preventing insider data exfiltration in both directions when dealing with sensitive data (by blocking file transfer, copy paste, etc)\n\nadmittedly it's diverse, and hard make generalizations about customers.\n\none way i think is cool that i haven't seen yet (but want to get around to doing myself!) is a way to deliver \"browser extensions\" without needing either: 1) a compatible browser on your device, 2) the extension to come from a store, 3) any local download. In some sense it's safer as the extension does not run locally, but in other ways it's more dangerous as there's no central store. But it's very cool to explore, and what we really need for that is a great \"developer API\" that can expose a \"browser extensions\"-like layer.\n\nOne cool thing is that ad-blocking extensions built on BrowserBox will not be limited by the current restrictions that extensions developers face on existing platforms. The aim is to provide a powerful instrumentation api as simply as possible.\n\nthank you for your question :)\n\nbtw - 42matters looks great! love your site design, really fantastic look. analytics is surely lucrative, i knew a similarly focused company also bearing the name 42 i'm sure. somewhere before anyway (but surely it had a different origin!). is 42 indicative of something special in analytics?\n\nLong time ago, I did sth similar, i.e. made a screenshot every few seconds, with the purpose to automatically extract information from it, e.g. how long I was using some app.\n\nI wrote a PNG DB to split PNG images into many blocks and have each block stored in a DB. If there are several equal blocks, it is only stored once. Via a hash table, the lookup for such blocks is made fast. With this PNG DB, I have a compression rate of about 400-500%. https://github.com/albertz/png-db\n\nSome of the scripts I used to analyze the screenshots are here, but in the end, it was not really so successful and reliable: https://github.com/albertz/screenshooting\n\nIn the end, that lead to another project, where I just was storing that information more directly, i.e. what application was in the foreground, what file was open. https://github.com/albertz/timecapture\n\n> like if I see C# or Python it makes sense to me at least in some way\n\nCould it be that you're just more used to looking at C#/Python than other things, then other things are more foreign and therefor look messy?\n\nAs another anecdote, I cannot stand browsing/looking through C# code as it tends to be filled with various classes just to basically write very basic programs. The amount of over-engineering I've seen in C# surpasses everything else I've looked at. Not to mention how people seem to arbitrary chose between private/public with no real consensus on when to use what, everything seems to be encapsulated in the wrong way. And don't get me started on the infrastructure around it, csproj vs sln and dealing with dependencies/assemblies.\n\nBut then I mostly write Clojure code day-to-day, and I realize that my troubles for dealing with C# is mostly because of what I'm used to, not because the language itself is inherently shit. I only have myself to blame for this. I'm sure people who write C# day-to-day have the same feelings about Clojure as I have about C#.\n\nCopying text from the saved footage is wild!\n\nI had a poor man's version of this with TimeSnapper Classic, a free Windows utility that takes a screenshot every n seconds then lets you view a timelapse at the end of the day to show how you spent your time.\n\nAfter a few weeks my disk was starting to fill up with screenshots. I browsed the folders and noticed that most of the screenshots looked almost identical. \"I should come up with some kind of image codec optimized for image sequences, that diffs against the previous image to save space.\" Then realized I had basically reinvented GIF / video codec haha. So I wrote a script to shove the timestamp (filename) into the image itself (with ImageMagick), and convert them to video with ffmpeg. 99.9% size reduction!\n\nThis looks a lot more useful though.\n\nAbout Remember Everything\n\nI use singleFile ( browser extension) - saves a copy of every webpage I view on Chrome and FireFox. I use a program AutomaticScreenshotter to record my screen activity to capture other non browser activity. Enables me to work what I was doing on my PC at any past date. All files are saved in a Year/month/day dir structure. Finding stuff - use windows search at present.\n\nI also use ditto to save all copy and pastes in a mysqldb.\n\nI've been doing this since before 2010 ( the dir structure) THe extensions and screengrabs , only started that about 3-4 years ago.\n\nI've often wonder if forensic PC investigation tools would /could also be used ( my with some mods to help produce a PC timeline of my activity.\n\nCongrats on getting this off the ground, and thank you for putting it out there for us to learn from!\n\nI've been curious how Rewind worked under the hood because I've been playing with an idea in my head: an AI assistant that helps you protect your attention.\n\nYou would describe the kind of content that you consider a distraction, and any other constraints you have (e.g. \"Don't let me watch cat videos unless I'm on a break\".\n\nAnd whenever it sees you watching anything that fits your prompt, it'll pop up on the screen and start a conversation with you to try and understand whether you actually need to consume the content you're looking at.\n\nAn AI that intervenes when you're going off track (based purely on how YOU define going off track). Current website blocking approaches aren't useful because they're all-or-nothing. I don't ever want to block entire sites because often there's useful content there relevant for my work. I want to block content on a much more granular level.\n\nAnd I'd love for an \"attention audit\" at the end of each day. Attention is our most valuable asset, and I believe protecting it is a worthwhile endeavor... I'd just like some help doing so :).\n\nGenuinely so pleased with this! I'm a big fan of Rewind as a concept because, in general, I write down everything I do every day (helps with my poor memory, adhd, and in general), and a tool that can record my online-actions and facilitate search too is a game-changer for me (specially when it doesn't come with the hefty price tag).\n\nCouple things -- 1) Do you ever plan on introducing shortcuts to toggle rem as opposed to using the menu-bar option?\n\n2) What's storage like? Will rem's size keep getting larger and larger until I purge all? Or will I eventually get to select how long I want to 'remember' something (without manually having to 'start' and 'stop')?\n\n3) One bug I've caught a few times is - once I toggle timeline and just slide back to view previous 'memories', >50% of the time my device won't let me exit out of the 'timeline' and I'll have to exit out of rem (cmd+opt+esc) and re-open it.\n\nBut all in all, very happy with this!\n\nVery cool demo OP. Not sure why it's only for Apple Silicone, is it because of it's superior ML support compared to windows? Side oservarion, Olama is not available for Windows. Sadly I won't be able to test this out since I don't own a Apple Silicon notebook, I only have a Apple Intel and beefy Windows.\n\nI don't know if I am a basic programmer or lack the idea on how do folks go build something like this from scratch with no Swift programming language. If I was OP, I would first do bunch of Swift tutorials.\n\nThis will be wishful thinking but it is a legitimate side project to make a clone of this to work on Linx oe WIndows on programming language I am most comfortable in, Java and C#. I have zero background in building anything in ML and not at all familiar with Direct X api or Linux Desktop API or Direct X.\n\nThe point I am trying to make is there is crap ton of API and tools to be familiar with before even taking the step to code.\n\nHow did OP crack this with no exp in Swift to build this? Is it simplar to build project on Apple Silicon and I should get one?\n\nMind you, I have 4 YOE and code in Java and C# doing vanilla web API and bit of WinFoem/DevExpress work.\n\nI have been in software for a while now. I just love learning and doing cool stuff.\n\nAs for being able to hack in Swift specifically... I'm comfortable in 5-6 languages, and play with many more. The language itself feels like a mix of C# and Kotlin to me. But I had no familiarity with Mac OS APIs or SwiftUI / MVVM etc. but there's lots of docs, despite them having effectively no examples.\n\nThe repo has a lot of room to grow in terms of quality, which is perfectly ok in my book.\n\nRe: Apple Silicon - I should have just said \"I built it on my laptop which is an M1 Air and it's managing to keep up with the screenshot -> OCR -> ffmpeg rendering pipeline and not completely drain the battery and have a strong suspicion it will require a lot more work to get it to perform the same on Intel computers\"\n\nAs for clone it and build it in Linux / Windows - do it. And there are other comments here suggesting others want to do the same.\n\nI personally want this thing, if I can impact speed of it happening positively, awesome.\n\nI want to record everything and have this nice big dataset which is what I've experienced (on my laptop) the last X amount of time, and be able to do stuff with it - whether it's chat with a local llm or have a really good way to search back in time. I _constantly_ need things from the past.\n\nSurprisingly this is something that I have been thinking on for the whole 2023.\n\nI myself am really bad at documenting findings while doing research or bugfixing so I started at recording all my daily activities for both replaying research sessions and also for my future me in case something is not clear in the docs.\n\nThen I knew rewind and I was happy to know that I am not alone. This REM is the confirmation that this definitely has great use cases :)\n\nI’d rather prefer the recording phase to be as lightweight as possible so I am recording the full mp4 video and plan to re-encode at a lower rate at night. But there is a compromise between recording quality and file size, I do not want end up with several Petabytes of videos.\n\nWhat codec do you recommend for this use case? Lossy video codecs usually are very efficient for real images (just like the comparison between jpg/png) and I am sure a video format that is PNG based should be more efficient in space while preserving text quality.\n\nI am very interested in read your thoughts about this.",

      "# [Honest RescueTime Review by a Competitor by Jibble.io on 2023-12-09](https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime)\n1. Distraction-Free Focus Sessions\n\nRescueTime Focus Sessions are designed to help users achieve distraction-free productivity sprints by preparing the mind, body, and environment to engage in meaningful work. For a specific period defined by the user, it blocks out apps, sites, and programs that the user has pre-defined as unnecessary to the Focus Work, or high-impact and mentally demanding activities that require uninterrupted focus.\n\nFocus Sessions begin with a prep and optional warmups. The Focus Session prep is an essential step that consists of a few short questions to customize your Focus Session experience, namely about the nature of the work being done during the session, blocking options that specify which apps and sites are to be blocked by RescueTime while the session is ongoing, and music integrations with Spotify, Youtube, or other platforms to play focus-enhancing music of choice in the background as users go about the session.\n\nAfter the prep, users can opt to do Focus Session warmups that help improve productivity by preparing them mentally and physically for the work ahead. These activities prompt users to prime their environments and themselves with guided walkthroughs and audio narrations. This is a particularly thoughtful touch from RescueTime that I genuinely appreciate.\n\nDuring the session, RescueTime will display a countdown timer and progress bar that shows how much time remains for the particular session and what users have achieved during the elapsed time. Attempted visits to blocked sites or use of blocked apps and programs will result in a block page with a gentle notice to return to work. This is especially helpful for people who get easily distracted and can’t resist falling into rabbit holes of social media and entertainment usage during important tasks.\n\nOnce the session is finished, RescueTime will ask a few questions to help evaluate the session and provide a Focus Session report that details how a user did after their productivity sprint. This report shows users important statistics about their time spent on Focus Work activities, the number of distractions blocked in-session, and the number of days in their Focus Session streak.\n\nWhen a user enters into a Focus Session, all their devices connected to their RescueTime account will automatically be in focus session as well.\n\n2. Comprehensive Activity Tracking\n\nRescueTime automatically tracks all computer activity 12-24 hours after it is installed. It doesn’t require users to clock in or switch tasks on a dashboard every time something new is being started, except during Focus Sessions. This takes away a significant amount of time in the workday spent fiddling with timers and trackers for every task.\n\nWorking quietly in the background, RescueTime records every website and application users open or use during user-determined periods of tracking. It can be configured to collect full window titles, document titles, and URLs for more transparent activity monitoring. Users also have the option to specify which sites and programs should be tracked via a whitelist on the Monitoring Options page to protect tier privacy. This means that site-specific data from whitelisted sites are recorded just as usual, but activities on non-whitelisted sites are recorded merely as general browsing.\n\nRescueTime takes into consideration that not every day is a work day and that certain periods should be dedicated to things other than work for a balanced lifestyle. Users can specify which days and hours they would be working, during which RescueTime would track data as configured. On off days and hours, the software “takes a break” with the user and does not record any activity, as indicated by a grayed-out icon.\n\nTo “train” RescueTime, users can score or rank activities as high-impact and mentally demanding Focus Work, Other Work made up of day-to-day activities, or non-work Personal Activities. This “teaches” the software about users’ computer usage patterns so it can serve better analytics and be more intuitive in helping optimize productivity. Meetings are also tracked on a separate page. Collectively, these show how users’ time is utilized in various data-rich reports.\n\nGoals encourage users to help improve their habits by analyzing tracked data and creating actionable plans from it. Focus Work goals take into consideration their meeting schedules and personal information to create — and meet — realistic milestones. Distraction and communication goals help users focus on tasks by preventing distractions caused by multitasking, particularly on messaging apps. Balance goal warns of overwork, and gently nudges users to limit activity outside scheduled work periods.\n\nShould there be any activities essential to users’ goals done offline or away from the computer, they can be added manually to ensure that all work is accounted for and to help keep the analytics updated.\n\n3. Meticulous Work Hours Management\n\nSince RescueTime is built to manage users’ time consumption and build healthy productivity habits, it only checks out that it should have a meticulous work hours management feature. However, unlike the usual shift scheduling features commonly seen in similar productivity management software, RescueTime does not work as a shift scheduling tool, nor does it claim to be. Rather, it functions as a personal schedule management assistant that is geared towards achieving the best possible results both in productivity and work-life balance.\n\nUpon installation, users can set up and define their work schedules —which days they expect to work during a week, and which hours on the chosen days. This initial information affects how RescueTime analyzes tracked data and influences how the software interprets users’ time usage.\n\nOn the days and hours that users designate for work, RescueTime enters into “work mode” and tracks as usual, logging time and activities in the background. All Focus Work logged during this period will count towards users’ Focus Work goals. Outside that, RescueTime goes into Recharge Time, which is meant to ensure that users do other significant things outside work, such as getting enough rest, taking care of themselves, spending time on their passions, and reconnecting with loved ones.\n\nAny activities done during Recharge Time will not be credited towards users’ Focus Work goals or recorded in the Overview and Activities pages unless they click the “Back to Work” button. The use of Recharge Time would reflect on users’ Balance Report, which details how time their time usage is affecting their work-life balance.\n\nRescueTime has default settings for work week schedules that users can utilize straight out of the box, or they can edit it to match their unique working styles and needs to the T. They can choose how many hours they want to work in a week, how many hours to devote to daily focus goals every day, the duration of daily break time, the beginning of the work week (either Sunday or Monday), preferred time format (either 12-hour or 24-hour), and when they want daily reports to be delivered.\n\nWhile these features do not resemble or function like the usual scheduling systems where managers can create shifts and assign them to team members, RescueTime’s work hours management system is a valuable and highly enriching method to create — and ingrain — the habit of showing up when needed.\n\n4. Daily Reviews and In-depth Reports\n\nAs previously discussed, RescueTime offers quick views of productivity on a daily basis through the End of Day Report, as well as through more in-depth reports that present collected data in various ways to inform users of patterns that affect their productivity and influence their habits.\n\nThe End of Day Report, also known as Daily Review, is generated by RescueTime and sent to the user at the end of the day or at user-specified times. These reports contain information about all of the activities done within the workday, such as time spent on Focus Work and if Focus Work goals have been met. It also shows the number, duration, and top activities of Focus Sessions, time spent on distractions and communication, as well as the number of times users shifted from Focus Work to other activities.\n\nSimilarly, the RescueTime Weekly Review displays information about logged activities at the end of the work week and shows a breakdown of how the week’s total worked hours were spent. It lets users know what time they were most productive during the week, how many Focus Sessions they had, how much time was spent on Focus Work, and what the top focus activity of the week was. It also records the total hours spent on meetings, how many times users shifted from focus work to communications, and the average of how many such shifts happened per hour.\n\nOther reports also offer data-rich views into users’ time-spending habits. The Detailed Activity Reporting shows users how much time they spent on any particular site or program, and with Page Title Tracking enabled, RescueTime can also record and present specific information about files and webpages in the programs they use and the sites they visit.\n\nRescueTime can also categorize activities intuitively according to input sources to give a deeper understanding of time expenditure. Activities done on mobile devices, desktops, and offline are separated in the reports to show which activities are most productive or distracting, and where they happen.\n\nTrending reports show how users’ habits evolve and are particularly useful when learning a new skill or trying to ingrain a desired habit. Using an easily understandable graph, RescueTime displays trends for any chosen period so users can compare and contrast progress accumulated over days, weeks, or months, and where to make necessary adjustments for better results.\n\n5. Productivity Pulse\n\nRescueTime’s Productivity Pulse is a productivity meter that calculates the score of any certain period — say, a day or a week — on a donut graph that displays how many productivity points out of a hundred a user accumulates according to their time expenditure. The score is calculated as the time-weighted average of the five different categories of activities previously discussed, ranging from very productive to very distracting. If users spend more time doing activities defined as productive, the score will rise. If users spend more time doing activities designated as unproductive, the score will shrink.\n\nRescueTime understands that no one is 100% productive all the time, and users are not encouraged to shoot for 100% at any time — as human beings, time spent recharging and doing other things aside from work is absolutely essential, and maintaining balance is a must. The average Productivity Pulse score across the RescueTime user base is around 70% and usually hovers around 58% daily.\n\nThis feature provides a visual and easily understandable representation of time utilization and is especially helpful when users need to quickly check their productivity score or to keep track of progress and set up scores to beat. Having a number to surpass is a surefire way of motivating users to do better; RescueTime’s Productivity Pulse provides just the challenge to keep them on fire.",

      "# [5 Reasons RescueTime is Great (by a Competitor) by Jibble.io on 2023-05-15](https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime/5-ways-rescuetime-is-great)\nRescueTime is a software application that enables users to monitor and analyze their digital activities, including how much time they spend on different websites, apps, and programs. Its advanced time-tracking features and productivity tools make it a popular choice for individuals and businesses looking to optimize their work habits and boost their overall efficiency.\n\nIn this article, I will discuss the features that differentiate RescueTime from other time tracking applications and why it’s an excellent option to consider. If you want to know more about what sets RescueTime apart, keep reading.\n\n1. Combines time tracked on multiple devices\n\nWell, RescueTime combines the time tracked on multiple devices to provide a comprehensive analysis of an individual’s digital activity.

With RescueTime’s productivity analysis, users can identify time-wasting habits, focus on productive activities, and set goals to improve their productivity.

Extensive reports\n\nAnd yes, RescueTime’s customizable reports provide detailed breakdowns of an individual’s digital activity, including productivity levels, top activities, and time spent on specific projects or tasks. The reports can be viewed on the dashboard or generated for a specific period. The reports categorize activities as productive, neutral, or distracting, helping users identify patterns and adjust their digital behavior to improve productivity. Goals can also be set and tracked through the reports.\n\n5. Customization of goals for each user\n\nI also like how RescueTime lets users personalize their goals to monitor their progress and attain specific objectives. This feature enables users to establish targets for various activities, set reminders, and access detailed progress reports. By offering a tailored approach, RescueTime can help users enhance productivity and time management skills based on their preferences and requirements.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, RescueTime offers a powerful set of features to help individuals and businesses optimize their digital behavior and improve productivity. With its automatic time tracking, goal-setting, alerts, and website/app blocking capabilities, RescueTime provides a comprehensive view of how time is spent throughout the workday.

      "# [Reclaim your time: The best apps to end the doomscrolling habit by MarketingTech News, Advertising Technology on 2024-09-17](https://www.marketingtechnews.net/news/reclaim-your-time-the-best-apps-to-end-the-doomscrolling-habit/)\nDoomscrolling is the habit of endlessly scrolling through negative news on social media and news sites. This article will explain doomscrolling, its effects, and how to stop it.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nDoomscrolling is a compulsive behaviour driven by negativity bias, anxiety and social media algorithms that negatively impact mental health.\n\nTo break the doomscrolling cycle, understand its causes, set boundaries and adopt positive daily habits.\n\nUtilising digital well-being apps, practising mindfulness, and recognising triggers can significantly help individuals regain control over their digital consumption and improve their overall mental health.\n\nUnderstanding doomscrolling\n\nDoomscrolling is characterised as a compulsive behaviour where individuals continuously seek negative news and information on social media or news feeds. This behaviour often stems from a desire to stay informed and protect oneself from perceived dangers, especially in uncertain times. However, it can quickly become a habit that is hard to break.\n\nSocial media and news platforms like Facebook and YouTube contribute to this behaviour by using algorithms designed to keep users engaged. These algorithms tend to amplify negative content, fostering a cycle of negative emotions and compulsive scrolling. Factors such as social media addiction, fear of missing out (FOMO) and features of social media platform usage further exacerbate this issue.\n\nCauses of doomscrolling\n\nThe causes of doomscrolling are multifaceted, involving cognitive biases, psychological factors, and habit formation. Negativity bias, the tendency to focus on negative news, plays a significant role. Psychological factors such as anxiety and the need for control also contribute to this behaviour. Together, these elements create a self-reinforcing cycle that makes it difficult to stop doomscrolling.\n\nUnderstanding these underlying causes is crucial for developing effective strategies to break the cycle. Addressing these factors individually allows for better management of digital habits and enhances overall mental health.\n\nNegativity bias\n\nNegativity bias refers to the tendency of individuals to prioritise negative experiences and information over positive ones. This bias significantly influences media consumption, leading people to seek out and focus on negative news. This tendency becomes even more pronounced during times of uncertainty, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Constant exposure to bad news distorts your world view, heightens anxiety and reinforces the cycle of seeking negative information.\n\nThis cycle of consuming negative news and heightened anxiety creates a self-reinforcing loop. Individuals may feel compelled to continue seeking negative information, which in turn increases their anxiety and distress. This loop can lead to a range of negative emotions, including sadness, depression and low self-esteem.\n\nShifting focus toward positive news and experiences demands a conscious effort to break free from this cycle. Actively seeking out positive content helps counteract negativity bias and reduces anxiety and stress levels, including solutions-focused news stories.\n\nPsychological factors\n\nPsychological factors such as anxiety and psychological distress play a significant role in doomscrolling. Increased levels of anxiety often lead individuals to engage in doomscrolling as a coping mechanism. The repetitive behaviour of consistently returning to negative news further exacerbates these feelings of anxiety and distress.\n\nThe DASS-21 questionnaire, a tool for assessing psychological distress, measures levels of depression, anxiety and stress. Individuals experiencing high levels of these symptoms are more likely to engage in doomscrolling, seeking a sense of control over their emotions.\n\nTackling these psychological factors is key to breaking the doomscrolling habit and improving mental health.\n\nHabit formation\n\nDoomscrolling can develop into a mindless habit, making it difficult to break. The brain anticipates the act of scrolling and nudges individuals towards it, reinforcing the behaviour. Over time, this can become a self-perpetuating cycle, where individuals scroll without fully registering what they are consuming.\n\nBreaking this bad habit requires conscious effort and the implementation of new routines. Understanding habit formation and replacing negative behaviours with positive ones helps individuals regain control over their scrolling habits and enhances overall well-being.\n\nPsychological effects\n\nThe psychological effects of doomscrolling are profound and far-reaching. This behaviour is correlated with a decline in emotional health, manifesting as increased stress and anxiety. Nearly a third of American adults report anxiety linked to doomscrolling. Continuous exposure to negative content can trigger stress responses within the body, leading to chronic stress and depression over time.\n\nIndividuals who frequently engage in doomscrolling may experience heightened feelings of fear, sadness and countless negative thought patterns. This compulsive behaviour can disrupt sleep patterns, contribute to long-term health issues, and make it challenging for individuals to relax and enjoy life. The psychological characteristics linked to individuals who doomscroll include emotional instability, low self-esteem and increased sadness.\n\nRecognizing these effects underscores the importance of breaking the doomscrolling habit. Individuals can improve their mental health and overall well-being by addressing the root causes and implementing strategies to reduce screen time.\n\nLong-term impacts\n\nThe long-term impacts of doomscrolling extend beyond mental health, affecting physical health as well. Chronic engagement in doomscrolling is associated with long-term mental health issues, including chronic stress and depression. These persistent stress responses can lead to a decline in both mental and physical health.\n\nExcessive doomscrolling can lead to physical health issues like diabetes, weight gain, and high blood pressure. The sedentary nature of excessive screen time combined with the stress of consuming negative content can seriously affect overall health.\n\nUnderstanding these long-term impacts motivates individuals to break the doomscrolling habit and adopt healthier behaviours.\n\nDigital well-being and time management\n\nDigital well-being and time management are critical components of a healthy relationship with technology. Engaging too much with social media content can foster unhealthy coping strategies, affecting personal and professional relationships. Filtering content on social media to focus on positive accounts can enhance digital well-being.\n\nEstablishing time limits for news consumption and using app timers can help prevent excessive doomscrolling. RescueTime, for instance, monitors user activity to provide insights on how time is spent, aiding in better time management and productivity. Additionally, apps like Headway offer concise book summaries aimed at helping users achieve their personal goals and reduce time spent scrolling.\n\nGradually incorporating these strategies into your daily routine helps break the doomscrolling cycle and fosters healthier digital habits. Taking control of digital consumption fosters a more balanced and fulfilling life.\n\nApps to help end doomscrolling\n\nSeveral apps are designed to help individuals stop doomscrolling and reclaim control over their screen time. These tools offer various features to block distracting websites, promote focused productivity and encourage positive digital habits.\n\nThe following subsections explore some of the best apps to have on your phone for combating doomscrolling.\n\nHeadway\n\nThe Headway book summary app provides concise book summaries, allowing users to absorb key insights without reading full-length texts. Headway encourages learning and growth by offering diverse content and supporting users in their personal and professional goals.\n\nThis app can replace the habit of doomscrolling with a more productive and enriching use of time.\n\nFreedom\n\nThe Freedom app is designed to block distracting websites and applications, allowing users to create custom block lists and schedule focus sessions. With features like ‘Locked mode,’ users can prevent themselves from altering block settings during active sessions, promoting sustained focus.\n\nThis app helps users regain control over their digital behaviour and create a distraction-free environment for productivity.\n\nForest\n\nThe Forest app helps users stay focused by allowing them to grow virtual trees as they avoid using their phones. This gamified approach motivates users to remain focused, rewarding them with virtual trees that grow over time.\n\nForest reinforces positive habits, helping individuals break the cycle of mindless scrolling.\n\nRescueTime\n\nRescueTime tracks user activity on devices to provide insights into time management and productivity levels. By monitoring how time is spent across different activities, RescueTime helps users identify areas for improvement and develop better time management strategies.\n\nRescueTime aids users in managing their time more effectively and reducing unnecessary screen time.\n\nStayFocusd\n\nStayFocusd is a Chrome extension that restricts the amount of time spent on distracting websites, promoting productivity. By allowing users to set time limits on these sites, StayFocusd encourages more productive browsing habits and helps individuals stop doomscrolling.\n\nSpace\n\nThe Space app is designed to reduce screen time and promote healthier digital habits. With features like customisable screen time limits, app usage tracking and personalised reminders to take breaks, Space helps users increase mindfulness and better control their device usage. Users have reported feeling more in control and experiencing reduced anxiety after incorporating Space into their routines.\n\nChoosing the right app\n\nChoosing the right app to end doomscrolling depends on personal needs and usage patterns. Some apps, like StopScroll and NoScroll are designed to block specific types of content such as short videos, while still allowing access to other apps. Others, like ScreenZen and Playsee offer app-blocking features and encourage real-world interactions to reduce screen time.\n\nReflect on your specific goals and challenges when selecting an app. For instance, apps like Freedom or RescueTime might be more suitable if you struggle with productivity. If you need help managing social media usage, StayFocusd or Space could be more effective.\n\nFinding an app that aligns with your lifestyle and helps you regain control over digital consumption is crucial.\n\nBreaking the doomscrolling habit\n\nBreaking the doomscrolling habit requires a combination of strategies and tools. Setting specific time limits for social media and news consumption is a crucial first step. Engaging in alternative hobbies and physical activities can provide healthy coping mechanisms and shift focus away from screens.\n\nMindfulness practices, such as meditation and deep breathing exercises, can help reduce anxiety and improve mental health conditions. Incorporating these strategies into daily routines helps gradually break the cycle of doomscrolling and develop healthier digital habits.\n\nRecognizing triggers\n\nIdentifying specific emotions like anxiety and boredom can help individuals recognize when they are prone to doomscrolling. Tracking times of day when doomscrolling occurs and keeping a log of instances can reveal consistent patterns linked to emotions and external events.\n\nIdentifying these triggers is key to managing and reducing doomscrolling habits effectively.\n\nSetting boundaries\n\nCreating device-free zones like bedrooms or dining areas fosters healthier habits by reducing screen time. Establishing specific times for news and incorporating tech-free intervals throughout the day significantly reduces doomscrolling tendencies.\n\nMoving devices out of reach, especially during vulnerable times like first waking up, can also help reduce impulsive scrolling.\n\nPracticing mindfulness\n\nMindfulness practices like meditation and deep breathing reduce anxiety and counteract the effects of doomscrolling. Mindfully engaging with digital media, such as through slow scrolling, can enhance the quality of your online interactions.\n\nPractising mindfulness significantly helps break the doomscrolling cycle and improve mental health.\n\nReal-life success stories\n\nMany individuals have shared their journeys of breaking free from the doomscrolling habit, providing hope and inspiration for others. John, for instance, managed to cut his doomscrolling time by incorporating a nightly routine that included reading and limited screen time. Several successful individuals also point to using apps like StayFocusd and Freedom as effective tools that helped them set boundaries with their device usage.\n\nEach success story emphasises the importance of taking the first step toward breaking the cycle as a powerful means of reclaiming mental health. Implementing these strategies and tools can help you achieve similar success and lead a more balanced, fulfilling life.\n\nMaintaining progress\n\nConsistent use of mental health apps reinforces positive habits and tracks progress over time. Creating a routine around mental health practices enhances stability and maintains progress. Setting achievable daily and weekly goals keeps participants focused and accountable in their mental health journey.\n\nUsing digital tools to track moods and symptoms allows individuals to visualise progress and stay committed. Responding quickly to setbacks is crucial for maintaining progress and avoiding the all-or-nothing mindset. Patience and consistency are key to successfully integrating new habits into your routine.\n\nIntegrating new habits\n\nIntegrating new habits into daily life is crucial for maintaining long-term mental health and overcoming doomscrolling. Setting specific, achievable goals can help individuals gradually incorporate new positive habits. Establishing a daily routine that prioritises healthy digital consumption can facilitate the integration of new habits.\n\nBy consciously replacing negative behaviours with positive ones, individuals can create lasting change and improve their overall well-being, reflecting a deeper understanding of human behaviour.\n\nEncouraging first steps\n\nTaking the first step today helps you reclaim control over your time and mental well-being. Recognising the need for change is crucial, and mindfulness practices are powerful tools in breaking the doomscrolling habit.\n\nApps like Freedom and Forest can effectively assist users in managing their screen time and combating distractions. Regularly checking your progress and adjusting strategies leads to lasting change and improved mental health.\n\nSummary\n\nBreaking the cycle of doomscrolling is essential for improving mental health and reclaiming time for more fulfilling activities.

Be honest with yourself.\n\nEvery Friday morning, I do a Time Audit. You can do this just by looking at your calendar, or you can use a free app like RescueTime you can track precisely where your time went this week. How much did you actually get done, and how much of your time was robbed by inconsequential, time-wasting distractions, or tasks that led to your Frantic Friday.\n\nTime is a strange thing. We invented it to track life, but it is something we all have a different conception of. Someone who just got given a terminal diagnosis sees a week differently than a kid who just got back to school after their summer break.\n\nYou need to learn to see time as clearly as possible.

      "# [RescueTime: Dive into Efficiency [with RescueTime vs Everhour] by black-and-white films on 2024-06-02](https://everhour.com/blog/rescuetime-vs-everhour-examining-the-two/)\nMany organizations now apply the best time tracking practices to monitor employee activity and measure team performance to improve business operations. Thanks to time tracking tools, such as RescueTime, monitoring and improving productivity has never been easier. This article will shed light on RescueTime – its main features, pricing, pros & cons, tips and tricks, and compare two popular tools to determine which time tracker will be on top: RescueTime vs Everhour.\n\nWhat Is RescueTime?\n\nWe’ll begin by exploring RescueTime. The tool was created to tackle some of the problems present in the modern workplace, namely, stress, reduced productivity, and burnout. One of the best ways to improve your productivity is to understand how you spend your time, so you can make necessary adjustments. RescueTime tracks your activity on a computer or mobile device and then provides you with insights into how you spend your time.\n\nRescueTime Features\n\nRescue time provides users with a variety of useful features, which we’ll explore in more detail.\n\n🚜 Activity tracking\n\nOne of RescueTime’s best features is its activity-tracking feature. It lets users see exactly what their team members have been doing each day. The feature tracks the time a user spends on a particular website, app, or even a specific document, allowing management to review their team members’ working habits and make adjustments if necessary.\n\n🔖 Activity labeling\n\nOnce RescueTime has collected the necessary data about how you use your time, it will categorize it into how productive it is on a scale with five different productivity levels. Some websites may be deemed as distracting in some roles and productive in others. For example, scrolling through your company’s news website is part of your job if you’re a journalist. As a result, you can mark certain websites as productive rather than distracting.\n\n❗ Work goals and distraction blockers\n\nRescueTime enables you to set a personal daily work goal and allows you to block distractions when necessary during what the platform calls a ‘focus session’. The app tracks what you’re working on and will alert you when you’re beginning to lose focus or trying to work on too many tasks at one time.\n\n📊 Dashboard\n\nThis data is then presented on a dashboard. It gives you a productivity pulse and measures your productivity compared to the previous day. Additionally, the dashboard presents your activities by color: blue being productive, grey as neither productive nor distracted, and red as distracted. Finally, a table of each hour that you’ve worked that day will be populated with the color corresponding to the activity you did during that time.\n\nOnce you’ve used the app for a while, it will give you more detailed insights into how you use your time. For example, if you use the app for a couple of months, you may find that you’re particularly productive on certain days.\n\n📃 Reporting\n\nThe data recorded in the dashboard can be converted into a report, which you can download and share with whoever you like by emailing them a copy within the platform. With a premium subscription, users can view a wealth of information in reports. This includes:\n\n– Detailed activity reporting\n\n– Trends within your activity to show how you work overtime\n\n– A breakdown of your activities by an input source\n\n– The ability to view your data based on customized time filters\n\n– Exporting your data to CSV and filtering data based on specific keywords\n\n🔏 Privacy\n\nRescueTime allows you to disable the platform for certain apps and websites, giving you control over what information is recorded. You can pause the RescueTime app at any time. The app allows you to pause all RescueTime activity for 15 minutes, an hour, or until tomorrow to give you privacy.\n\nPlus, you can schedule the app to only record your activity at certain times of day, outside of these times, the app will not track your activity. That’s not all—you can also restrict which websites RescueTime logs by creating a white list of websites you would like RescueTime to track.\n\n🔁 Integrations\n\nYou can allow other apps to use your RescueTime data. The app can be integrated with several platforms, including but not limited to\n\nThese integrations enable you to get the most out of the platform. You can also export reports to a CSV file, but only if you have a premium subscription.\n\n🔧 Support and platforms\n\nRescueTime offers various support options if you encounter problems. The first port of call is the RescueTime knowledge base, where you’ll find informative articles about the platform, troubleshooting information, and FAQs. Suppose these pages do not help you fix a problem. In that case, you can contact the RescueTime team on the company website using the contact form, leave a phone message or email the team at contact@rescuetime.com.\n\nRescueTime is a web-based platform, but it also has a mobile app that lets you track mobile phone usage. The RescueTime app is available on Android and IOS.\n\n💲 Pricing\n\nRescueTime offers a free version of the app with limited features. The RescueTime premium plan, which includes all the outlined features, costs $6.50 a month per user when billed yearly.\n\n❓ Alternatives\n\nRescueTime is a great app if your main goal is to track your productivity. However, it does not offer the same billing and invoicing features as other time tracking and productivity apps on the market. If you’re looking for an alternative app to increase your productivity, consider Todoist.\n\nThe app is used by millions of people to plan and collaborate on projects of all sizes. You can write to-do lists, create labels, set priority levels to highlight your most pressing tasks, set reminders, highlight favorites, and delegate tasks to team members. Additionally, you can see tangible progress through productivity visualizations, which, by week and month, help you stay on track to achieve set goals.\n\n✅❌ Pros and cons of RescueTime\n\nWhy users might be looking for a RescueTime alternative?\n\nWhile RescueTime is fully functional and can take care of most of your needs, it’s worth taking a look at some of the drawbacks users might encounter when using it.\n\n1️⃣ Occasionally, it can be challenging to allocate a recorded activity to a specific project, particularly when managing multiple concurrent projects that require the same tools.\n\nEverhour simplifies the process of allocating recorded activities to specific projects, even when managing numerous concurrent projects with similar tool requirements.

Additionally, its efficient time-tracking features ultimately save time and enhance productivity, offsetting any initial learning investments.\n\nWhile Everhour’s pricing may appear slightly higher, its value lies in its extensive features, customizable options, and reliable customer support, making it a worthwhile investment for businesses seeking top-tier time-tracking solutions.\n\nWith Everhour’s mobile app and offline time tracking capabilities, users can seamlessly track their time from anywhere, ensuring accurate records even when internet connectivity is limited.

You can create new invoices based on tracked time and relevant expenses, use dynamic variables that will be replaced with real data in invoice line items, translate invoice labels, apply online invoice generator, and connect with accounting platforms such as QuickBooks, FreshBooks, or Xero to sync your clients, and copy invoices.\n\nAdditionally, Everhour enables you to track work-related expenses attach receipts to expenses, and use unit pricing per expense category.\n\n📃 Reporting\n\nEverhour provides in-depth reporting, allowing you to access analytics to increase productivity and show your clients exactly what they are paying for.
