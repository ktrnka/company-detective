      "# [Privacy Policy](https://www.rescuetime.com/privacy)\nMost recent version: February 21, 2025.\n\nBy using RescueTime, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your personal information for the purposes of providing you our product services as described below. We will notify all active accounts of any significant changes to this policy.\n\nYour data is never shared\n\nYour privacy is really important to us. At RescueTime, your data, analyzed, is the product we offer back to you. We are not an ad supported company. Our free service is intended to entice you to premium service. If you have any concerns that aren't covered here, please contact us. Below are the details of this policy:\n\nWe will never sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal information, with or without personally identifying information. Furthermore, we will never share anonymized selections of your individual data. That includes any government (foreign or domestic) unless we are compelled by law. If we are required by law to disclose any of the information collected about you, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email. We will independently object to overly broad requests for access to information about users of our site.\n\nWe may share information about user behavior in the aggregate only. For example, we could share information like, \"which day of the week do people spend the most time in front of their computer?\" This type of analysis is used to enrich the product, and to represent our domain expertise to our audiences.\n\nYou can delete your data at any time — all of it, or just a slice of it. You can also delete your account at any time. Deleting your account deletes all your data from our database.\n\nWe won't spam you, ever, either directly or indirectly by sharing of email information. We might occasionally send one-time messages about important RescueTime news. We will likely continue to introduce ways that you can optionally have RescueTime contact you with data that you care about, but you will always be able to turn this on or off.\n\nFor individual accounts, no other user can see any of your data or personal information. We may provide features to allow you to share selections of your data, but this will be voluntary and opt-in only, and handled per-situation, and not buried in a terms of service.\n\nFor team accounts, sharing of data is controlled by the administrator of the account and by default does not allow anyone in the team account access to your data. No one outside of your organization will have access to any of your data. Default team implementations do not permit the sharing of individual data in any form that is not aggregated (eg, your team's average communication per week). When consulting with team implementations, we promote transparency and user driven control.\n\nHow do we protect your data?\n\nYour data is always encrypted in transit. All requests with the RescueTime web app and client apps are encrypted with current best practice SSL configurations.\n\nYour data is always encrypted at rest. All of our storage uses volume encryption.\n\nWe maintain ongoing vulnerability scanning, respond immediately to security advisories, and stay PCI compliant.\n\nWhat information does RescueTime collect? How is it used?\n\nAccount information includes email address (verification optional), city, state, and country. Optional demographic information includes gender, date of birth, industry, job title, company size, and income may be requested, to enrich the accuracy of our reporting for your work patterns.\n\nRescueTime records information about the currently active application or website on your computer. We record for processing the following information: 1) for time analysis: application name, web site URL, window title, start time of use, end time of use and 2) for distinguishing you and your device: device login name (your system user name), device name, device operating system version, and sometimes the manufacturer. For some inputs, the public internet address you are operating from is saved, for your security (and ours), and for troubleshooting. Like all activity information, it is discarded with account deletion.\n\nWe do not (and never will) collect keystrokes, form input, screenshots, window or page body content, or anything nefarious. Before storage for your reports, URLs are trimmed to the site name and sometimes top level directory when a site has distinct web apps. Query strings are discarded. Site controls allow you to selectively delete and ignore forever any item you prefer not be stored.\n\nData Retention, Deletion and Account Removal\n\nAll your data is destroyed in its entirety when you delete your account, except account activity logs required for business audit records. This process can take up to 3 days to protect against accidental deletion. Users can request immediate deletion by contacting support.\n\nYou can selectively delete portions of your activity data at any time on our website via activity reports.\n\nYou can delete all of your own activity data at any time on our website in the Data & Privacy section of account settings, by clicking \"Erase your logged time\".\n\nYou can delete your account, which also deletes all of your activity data, by clicking \"Delete your account\" on the Data & Privacy section of account settings.\n\nFree account user data older than 15 months is automatically deleted on a continuous basis.\n\nCookies and Log Files\n\nRescueTime.com sends a \"cookie\" to your computer that contains an identifier that is unique to your browser session. We use this cookie to validate your authentication, provide you with a continuous experience, and to record how our site/service is being used. It is not used for marketing purposes.\n\nAs is done with most web sites, we log each visit to each web page. A log entry can contain information typically found in the \"header\" of your web browser's request such as the browser type you used, your Internet Protocol address, and the date and time of day. We may also log your session identifier and the URL of a site that referred you. This log information is important for security, audit, quality improvement, as well as for monitoring the health of our service.",
      "# [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/security)\nInfrastructure and Platform: Safe Foundations\n\nA secure design for hardware, networks, and deployments.\n\nTo make RescueTime work, there are two principle components: the application that runs on your device and the cloud-based service that processes the data and builds results for you. The client runs on multiple platforms and devices (Windows, Apple OS X, Linux, Android, ChromeOS), and is principally responsible for automatically measuring how the device is used. The client also offers some additional user-facing features that are best delivered outside the browser. The cloud service receives data from the client and also provides the client with statistics and configuration information to enrich the user's experience and manage client features.\n\nThe Client Application Platform\n\nFor desktop systems, the client is built on a common codebase using standard cross-platform libraries that work across Windows, OS X and Linux. This encompasses the code used for secure communication with our servers, as well as configuration handling and time logic. We maintain our client with regular updates, publish change information, audit and test all changes, and track dependent library security updates. Our client is designed to be lightweight, with a negligible memory and processor footprint, using a compact codebase and minimized complexity to reduce risk.\n\nFor mobile systems, we currently support automatic time collection on Android devices, including phones and tablets. Our app is built entirely inside the Android SDK and so takes advantage of the Google Android team's own security provisions (app sandboxing, regular platform maintenance updates, etc).\n\nMore about how the client works >>\n\nThe Cloud Service Platform\n\nRescueTime data processing, reporting, and account management is handled through our website locations, which are all hosted on Amazon's EC2 facility. Out of the box, EC2 gives us audited robust infrastructure security, both physical and network level. On that foundation, we provide additional feature-targeted firewalling, privilege separation and controls, two-factor access methods, and logged, auditable operations interfaces. Our website services are built on common open-source platforms, apps and frameworks that we monitor for regular security maintenance updates, both at the operating system level and for required apps and libraries.\n\nAll operational interaction with our platform is accomplished through either HTTPS or SSH (secure tunnels). Our testing and development deployments are maintained in a matching configuration, with access only through HTTPS and SSH tunnels. We do not maintain any office based data storage or services. All of our engineering resources are secured in EC2 under the same practices and policies applied to the production configuration.\n\nMore about the site and web services >>\n\nRescueTime and HIPAA, HITECH, SAS70 and more\n\nHow regulations and policies may affect you.\n\nHIPAA / HITECH: privacy and security requirements\n\nWe have clients, including individuals and teams, in many different lines of business. Some have concerns driven by protection of intellectual property, others have regulatory requirements. For those under HIPAA compliance standards for their software purchases:\n\nIs it even required? HIPAA requirements are triggered when a software product maintains patient identifiable information. For this reason, your use of RescueTime would likely be covered by HIPAA, because some applications' window titles may have a patient's name or similar small but identifiable detail. It would be possible to take advantage of our privacy configurations and controls to restrict what is captured and measured, to prevent this requirement altogether while using RescueTime. However, this may limit the utility of the product to you.\n\n... So, assuming you need HIPAA compliance to use RescueTime:\n\nSecure network transmission: HIPAA requires that all transmission of data between your business or our software be encrypted. RescueTime meets this requirement.\n\nPhysical security: The service must be hosted in an access limited and monitored facility. RescueTime meets this requirement by maintaining all resources in Amazon's EC2 data center.\n\nAccess control: Operational access to the service must be secured for authorized use only and be auditable. RescueTime meets this requirement.\n\nSafe practices and policies: The service should maintain disaster recovery plans and offsite backups. RescueTime meets this requirement, primarily by leveraging features of Amazon's EC2 service.\n\nThe HITECH supplement requires SaaS products to report intrusion or security events that effect customers' data. Specifically, the requirement is that if customer data resides in storage unencrypted (for example, a backup), even in a secured environment, that the service provider (us) must notify all and any customers whose data could have been vulnerable as the result of an intrusion event or other security violation. RescueTime guarantees its customers that it will alert any and all customers possibly affected by a security defect or hacking event.\n\nNote: At this time, RescueTime has not contracted an audit firm to provide third party validation of compliance. Please contact sales@rescuetime.com for more information on how we can accommodate your needs.\n\nSAS70 and the rest\n\nRescueTime is a fast growing business, and we contract services as needed as we continue to grow. As of this time we have not engaged our own SAS70 audit. Much of what these audits require is covered simply by operating on EC2. However, the web site services above and beyond the platform level is not. We are happy to consider all questions regarding obtaining audits. We have some clients that perform their own tests against our system to ensure we meet their standards.",

We will notify all active accounts of any significant changes to this policy.\n\nYour data is never shared\n\nYour privacy is really important to us. At RescueTime, your data, analyzed, is the product we offer back to you. We are not an ad supported company. Our free service is intended to entice you to premium service. If you have any concerns that aren't covered here, please contact us. Below are the details of this policy:\n\nWe will never sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal information, with or without personally identifying information. Furthermore, we will never share anonymized selections of your individual data. That includes any government (foreign or domestic) unless we are compelled by law. If we are required by law to disclose any of the information collected about you, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email. We will independently object to overly broad requests for access to information about users of our site.\n\nWe may share information about user behavior in the aggregate only. For example, we could share information like, \"which day of the week do people spend the most time in front of their computer?\" This type of analysis is used to enrich the product, and to represent our domain expertise to our audiences.\n\nYou can delete your data at any time — all of it, or just a slice of it. You can also delete your account at any time. Deleting your account deletes all your data from our database.\n\nWe won't spam you, ever, either directly or indirectly by sharing of email information. We might occasionally send one-time messages about important RescueTime news. We will likely continue to introduce ways that you can optionally have RescueTime contact you with data that you care about, but you will always be able to turn this on or off.\n\nFor individual accounts, no other user can see any of your data or personal information. We may provide features to allow you to share selections of your data, but this will be voluntary and opt-in only, and handled per-situation, and not buried in a terms of service.\n\nFor team accounts, sharing of data is controlled by the administrator of the account and by default does not allow anyone in the team account access to your data. No one outside of your organization will have access to any of your data. Default team implementations do not permit the sharing of individual data in any form that is not aggregated (eg, your team's average communication per week). When consulting with team implementations, we promote transparency and user driven control.\n\nHow do we protect your data?\n\nYour data is always encrypted in transit. All requests with the RescueTime web app and client apps are encrypted with current best practice SSL configurations.\n\nYour data is always encrypted at rest. All of our storage uses volume encryption.\n\nWe maintain ongoing vulnerability scanning, respond immediately to security advisories, and stay PCI compliant.\n\nWhat information does RescueTime collect? How is it used?\n\nAccount information includes email address (verification optional), city, state, and country. Optional demographic information includes gender, date of birth, industry, job title, company size, and income may be requested, to enrich the accuracy of our reporting for your work patterns.\n\nRescueTime records information about the currently active application or website on your computer. We record for processing the following information: 1) for time analysis: application name, web site URL, window title, start time of use, end time of use and 2) for distinguishing you and your device: device login name (your system user name), device name, device operating system version, and sometimes the manufacturer. For some inputs, the public internet address you are operating from is saved, for your security (and ours), and for troubleshooting. Like all activity information, it is discarded with account deletion.\n\nWe do not (and never will) collect keystrokes, form input, screenshots, window or page body content, or anything nefarious. Before storage for your reports, URLs are trimmed to the site name and sometimes top level directory when a site has distinct web apps. Query strings are discarded. Site controls allow you to selectively delete and ignore forever any item you prefer not be stored.\n\nData Retention, Deletion and Account Removal\n\nAll your data is destroyed in its entirety when you delete your account, except account activity logs required for business audit records. This process can take up to 3 days to protect against accidental deletion. Users can request immediate deletion by contacting support.\n\nYou can selectively delete portions of your activity data at any time on our website via activity reports.\n\nYou can delete all of your own activity data at any time on our website in the Data & Privacy section of account settings, by clicking \"Erase your logged time\".\n\nYou can delete your account, which also deletes all of your activity data, by clicking \"Delete your account\" on the Data & Privacy section of account settings.\n\nFree account user data older than 15 months is automatically deleted on a continuous basis.\n\nCookies and Log Files\n\nRescueTime.com sends a \"cookie\" to your computer that contains an identifier that is unique to your browser session. We use this cookie to validate your authentication, provide you with a continuous experience, and to record how our site/service is being used. It is not used for marketing purposes.\n\nAs is done with most web sites, we log each visit to each web page. A log entry can contain information typically found in the \"header\" of your web browser's request such as the browser type you used, your Internet Protocol address, and the date and time of day. We may also log your session identifier and the URL of a site that referred you. This log information is important for security, audit, quality improvement, as well as for monitoring the health of our service.",
      "# [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/rtx/developers)\nConnecting to the RescueTime API\n\nThere are two ways to connect to a user’s data in RescueTime, via API Keys or via an Oauth2 Connection. The API keys are ideal for personal use, while web services wishing to offer a way for their users to use their RescueTime data should use an Oauth2 connection.\n\nAPI Key Access:\n\nUsers can set up an API key by going to their key management page and creating a new key. That key must be included with each API request. The user can revoke keys at any time.\n\nOauth2 Connection Access:\n\nPlease contact us and we’ll work with you to set up an Oauth2 application. After the user connects their account via Oauth2, an access token will be created. That access token must be included in each API request. The user can revoke access to a service at any time.\n\nOauth2 Authorization Flow\n\nOnce we have created your Oauth2 application, your app will be assigned a client_id and a client_secret. These tokens can then be used, along with the secure redirect_uri provided in the request for an oauth application, in the following steps to authorize your application's user access to their RescueTime data:\n\nA GET request to the following URL:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&response_type=code&scope=YOUR_SCOPES\n\nThis will return the auth_code, which will expire in 10 minutes.\n\nA POST request to the following URL:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/oauth/token\n\nwith a JSON body of:\n\n{\n\n\"client_id\": YOUR_CLIENT_ID,\n\n\"client_secret\": YOUR_APP_SECRET,\n\n\"grant_type\": \"authorization_code\",\n\n\"code\": AUTH_CODE,\n\n\"redirect_uri\": YOUR_REDIRECT_URI\n\n}\n\nThis will return the access_token\n\nData can then be accessed with the access_token, as shown in this example URL:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/data?access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN&by=interval&taxonomy=productivity&interval=hour&restrict_begin=2018-01-01&restrict_end=2018-01-31&format=json&scopes=time_data\n\nOauth2 Access Scopes\n\nWhen users connect their accounts to your application via Oauth2, you can specify access scopes to let the user know exactly how you will be using their RescueTime data. Scopes will be requested during the initial authorization request.\n\nThe following scopes are currently supported:\n\ntime_data: Access activity history and summary time data or post offline time for the authorized user\n\ncategory_data: Access how much time the authorizing user spent in specific categories\n\nproductivity_data: Access how much time the authorizing user spent in different productivity levels\n\nalert_data: Access the authorizing user's alert history\n\nhighlight_data: Read from and post to the authorizing user's daily highlights list\n\nfocustime_data: Access the authorizing user's Focus Session history and session starting and stopping\n\nAPI Endpoints\n\nThere are several API endpoints that can be used to access different types of data within RescueTime.\n\nAnalytic Data API:\n\nThe Analytic Data API is targeted at bringing developers the prepared and pre-organized data structures already familiar through the reporting views of www.rescuetime.com.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Analytic Data API\n\nDaily Summary Feed API:\n\nThe Daily Summary Feed API provides a structured rollup of daily data about the time logged by a user. This data includes: total time logged, time logged at each productivity level, average productivity pulse, and the time spent in each major category.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Daily Summary Feed API\n\nAlerts Feed API:\n\nThe Alerts Feed API provides a feed of recent occurrences of user-defined alerts. It is a good way to let users define aspects of their data that they care about (“I want to spend more than 5 hours per day on All Productive Time”, for example) and then use that data in an external service.\n\nNote: Alerts are a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return empty results for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Alerts Feed API\n\nHighlights Feed API:\n\nThe Highlights Feed API provides a feed of recently entered daily highlights.\n\nNote: Highlights are a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return empty results for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Highlights Feed API\n\nHighlights POST API:\n\nThe Highlights POST API allows users to post a daily highlight entry programatically. An example use case is posting a new highlight whenever a software developer makes a new check-in to their GIT repository.\n\nNote: Highlights are a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return a 400 response for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Highlights Post API\n\nFocus Session Trigger API:\n\nThe Focus Session Trigger API allows users to start Focus Session on their active devices programatically.\n\nNote: Focus Session is a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return a 400 response for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Focus Session Trigger API\n\nFocus Session Feed API:\n\nThe Focus Session Feed API provides a feed of recent Focus Session \"started\" or Focus Session \"ended\" events. An example use case would be to set a chat application status to \"away\" when a new Focus Session started event has been detected.\n\nNote: Focus Sessions are a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return a 400 response for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Focus Session Feed API\n\nOffline Time POST API:\n\nThe Offline Time POST API allows users to post offline time to their account programmatically. An example use case would be to post offline time based on localtion data or meeting times.\n\nNote: Offline Time is a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return a 400 response for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Offline Time Post API\n\nDocumentation for the Analytic Data API\n\nRescueTime data is detailed and complicated. The Analytic Data API is targeted at bringing developers the prepared and pre-organized data structures already familiar through the reporting views of www.rescuetime.com. The data is read-only through the webservice, but you can perform any manipulations on the consumer side you want. Keep in mind this is a draft interface, and may change in the future. We do intend to version the interfaces though, so it is likely forward compatible.\n\nThe Analytic Data API allows for parameterized access, which means you can change the subject and scope of data, and is especially targeted for developer use. The data can be accessed via the HTTP Query interface in several formats.\n\nThe Analytic Data API is presented as a read-only resource accessed by simple GET HTTP queries. This provides maximum flexibility with minimal complexity; you can use the provided API tools, or just research the documented parameters and construct your own queries.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach this HTTP query API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key: https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/data\n\nFor Oauth2 connections:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/data - This is the least restritive url and requires the time_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRestricted Report: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/overview_data - This url will restricts the output to top level category data only and requires the category_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRestricted Report: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/category_data - This url will restricts the output to sub-category data only and requires the category_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRestricted Report: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/productivity_data - This url will restricts the output to productivity data only and requires the productivity_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nAbout restricted reports: Restricted reports may be useful if your application requires a less-granular rollup of the data, such as the category view, but NOT the actual activities themselves. These restricted reports help ensure the user’s privacy, and may be a preferable option when asking them to link their accounts.\n\nRequired parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nformat - [ 'csv' | 'json' ]\n\nQuery Parameters\n\nPrimary names are chosen for human reading. The short names are for when GET query length is at a premium. The alias is for understanding roughly how it maps into the language used in reporting views, and our own internal nicknames.\n\nPrinciple name Short Alias Short Values Description perspectivepvbyby [ 'rank' | 'interval' ]\n\nConsider this the X - axis of the returned data. It is what determines how your data is crunched serverside for ordered return.\n\nrank: (default) Organized around a calculated value, usually a sum like time spent.\n\ninterval: Organized around calendar time.\n\nresolution_timersintervali [ 'month' | 'week' | 'day' | 'hour' | 'minute' ]\n\nDefault is \"hour\". In an interval report, the X axis unit. In other words, data is summarizd into chunks of this size. \"minute\" will return data grouped into five-minute buckets, which is the most granular view available.\n\nrestrict_beginrb date\n\nSets the start day for data batch, inclusive (always at time 00:00, start hour/minute not supported)\n\nFormat ISO 8601 \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n\nrestrict_endre date\n\nSets the end day for data batch, inclusive (always at time 00:00, end hour/minute not supported)\n\nFormat ISO 8601 \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n\nrestrict_kindrktaxonomyty [ 'category' | 'activity' | 'productivity' | 'document' ]\n\n('efficiency' is option when perspective is 'interval')\n\nAllows you to preprocess data through different statistical engines. The perspective dictates the main grouping of the data, this provides different aspects of that main grouping.\n\noverview: sums statistics for all activities into their top level category\n\ncategory: sums statistics for all activities into their sub category\n\nactivity: sums statistics for individual applications / web sites / activities\n\nproductivity: productivity calculation\n\nefficiency: efficiency calculation (not applicable in \"rank\" perspective)\n\ndocument: sums statistics for individual documents and web pages\n\nrestrict_thingrttaxontx name (of category, activity, or overview)\n\nThe name of a specific overview, category, application or website. For websites, use the domain component only if it starts with \"www\", eg. \"www.nytimes.com\" would be \"nytimes.com\". The easiest way to see what name you should be using is to retrieve a list that contains the name you want, and inspect it for the exact names.\n\nrestrict_thingyrysub_taxontn name\n\nRefers to the specific \"document\" or \"activity\" we record for the currently active application, if supported. For example, the document name active when using Microsoft Word. Available for most major applications and web sites. Let us know if yours is not.\n\nrestrict_source_type [ 'computers' | 'mobile' | 'offline' ]\n\nAllows for querying by source device type.\n\nrestrict_schedule_id rsi schedule_id s id (integer id of user's schedule/time filter)\n\nAllows for filtering results by schedule.\n\nOutput Formats\n\nThe Analytic Data API supports CSV and JSON output.\n\ncsv - layout provides rows of comma separated data with a header for column names at top.\n\njson - returns a JavaScript ready object. It has these properties:\n\nnotes = String, a short explanation of the data envelope\n\nrow_headers = Array, a label for the contents of each index in a row, in the order they appear in row\n\nrows = Array X Array, an array of data rows, where each row is itself an array described by the row_headers\n\nExample Queries\n\nTo request information about the user's productivity levels, by hour, for the date of January 1, 2020:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/data?key=YOUR_API_KEY&perspective=interval&restrict_kind=productivity&interval=hour&restrict_begin=2020-01-01&restrict_end=2020-01-01&format=json\n\nTo request a list of time spent in each top level category, ranked by duration, for the date of January 1, 2020:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/data?key=YOUR_API_KEY&perspective=rank&restrict_kind=overview&restrict_begin=2020-01-01&restrict_end=2020-01-01&format=csv\n\nDocumentation for the Daily Summary Feed API\n\nThe Daily Summary Feed API provides a high level rollup of the the time a user has logged for a full 24 hour period (defined by the user’s selected time zone). This is useful for generating notifications that don’t need to be real-time and don’t require much granularity (for greater precision or more timely alerts, see the Alerts Feed API). This can be used to construct a customized daily progress report delivered via email. The summary can also be used to alert people to specific conditions. For example, if a user has more than 20% of their time labeled as ‘uncategorized’, that can be used to offer people a message to update their categorizations on the website.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The Daily Summary Feed is ‘point in time‘ data - use the data api or export CSVs from reports if you want your latest categorization results.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach this Daily Summary Feed API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key: https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/daily_summary_feed\n\nFor Oauth2 connections: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/daily_summary_feed\n\nRequired parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nOutput Format\n\nThe Daily Summary Feed API returns an array of JSON objects representing rollup information for each day logged by the user in the previous two weeks. It does not include the current day, and new summaries for the previous day are available at 12:01 am in the user’s local time zone. The returned value for each daily summary includes the following information:\n\nGeneral information\n\nid - Unix Timestamp representation of the date. Can use useful for deduplication of items in the feed.\n\ndate - Summary Date\n\nproductivity_pulse - Overall productivity pulse. A scale bewteen 0-100\n\nPercentage representation of time spent in different categories (Float with one decimal place.

This is a good event-based representation of data that the user cares about. Alerts are a premium feature and as such the API will always return zero results for users on the RescueTime Lite plan.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach the Alerts Feed API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key: https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/alerts_feed\n\nFor Oauth2 connections: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/alerts_feed - Requires the alert_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRequired parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nop - [ status | list ]\n\nThe op parameter determines what type of information about the alerts is returned. Passing op=list will return a definition list of all the alerts currently defined by the user. This is useful for presenting a list of the user's alerts to allow the user to select an alert_id value that will be used to filter subsequent queries.\n\nPassing op a value of status is the default, and will return a list of recently triggered alerts in reverse-chronological order.\n\nOptional parameters\n\nalert_id - [ Integer ID of an alert to filter on ]\n\nOutput Format\n\nWhen passing op=list, The Alerts Feed API will return an array of JSON objects representing the currently active alerts that the user has defined. Each alert object has the following structure:\n\n{\n\n'id': integer (Unique id of the user-defined alert, can be used for filtering the triggered alerts),\n\n'description': string (The string representation of the alert definition),\n\n'amount': float (the number of hours the user has defined for this alert’s threshold)\n\n}\n\nWhen passing op=status, the feed returns an array of JSON objects representing the actual triggering of alerts in reverse chronological order. Each object has the following structure:\n\n{\n\n'id': integer (Unique id for the occurence of the alert triggering),\n\n'alert_id': integer (Unique id of the user-defined alert, can be used to filter alerts),\n\n'description': string (The message generated by the triggered alert),\n\n'created_at': datetime (The time, in user’s selected time zone, that the alert was triggered)\n\n}\n\nExample Queries\n\nTo request a list of for the user's active alerts:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/alerts_feed?key=YOUR_API_KEY&op=list\n\nTo request a list of alert 12345 being triggered for the user:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/alerts_feed?key=YOUR_API_KEY&op=status&alert_id=12345\n\nDocumentation for the Highlights Feed API\n\nThe Highlights Feed API is a list of recently entered Daily Highlight events.

Essentially, this key provides an alternative read-only authentication to your data. You can keep this key private, in which case it's just as safe as your login and password, or publish it, without exposing your account to other access or risks beyond the scope of the data.\n\nWe assume data api access is being requested for use on the server side of things, presumably in some code of your own. In this case, you can protect the key as you would any other server side secret. It would never be seen in the browser, but used by your application to retrieve data from us then process and render yourself somehow. So in this case, the key provides read-only access to your data by arbitrary scope (within limits) through parameters.\n\nAs a user, you can revoke access to keys you have created by going to your Key Management Page. Any applications you have connected to via an Oauth2 connection, can be revoked by going to your connected applications page.",

You will immediately notify RescueTime of any unauthorized use of your membership or any other breach of security.\n\n3. MEMBERSHIP, FEES\n\nIndividuals may obtain a membership with the Service without paying a fee. RescueTime will charge fees to access certain components of the Service.

We rely on parents and guardians to ensure minors only use RescueTime products and services if they can understand their rights and responsibilities as stated in this TOS and our Privacy Policy.\n\nFor teachers or parents, if you want children under the age of 13 to create their own RescueTime accounts, then you (or your school) assume the responsibility for complying with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and, to the extent applicable, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”). This means you must notify childrens’ parents/guardians of the information to be collected and obtain parental/guardian consent before collecting and sharing with the RescueTime products and services the personal information of children under the age of 13 in order to establish an account or use the RescueTime products and service. Teachers may, under appropriate, circumstances provide such consent on behalf of parents/guardians.

      "# [RescueTime](https://community.rescuetime.com/faq)\nThis is a Civilized Place for Public Discussion\n\nPlease treat this discussion forum with the same respect you would a public park. We, too, are a shared community resource — a place to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing conversation.\n\nThese are not hard and fast rules. They are guidelines to aid the human judgment of our community and keep this a kind, friendly place for civilized public discourse.\n\nImprove the Discussion\n\nHelp us make this a great place for discussion by always adding something positive to the discussion, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.\n\nOne way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening. Spend time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you’ll have a better chance of meeting others who share your interests.\n\nThe topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.\n\nBe Agreeable, Even When You Disagree\n\nYou may wish to respond by disagreeing. That’s fine. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Please avoid:\n\nName-calling\n\nAd hominem attacks\n\nResponding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content\n\nKnee-jerk contradiction\n\nInstead, provide thoughtful insights that improve the conversation.\n\nYour Participation Counts\n\nThe conversations we have here set the tone for every new arrival. Help us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an interesting place to be — and avoiding those that do not.\n\nDiscourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, watching, muting and so forth. Use these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else’s, too.\n\nLet’s leave our community better than we found it.\n\nIf You See a Problem, Flag It\n\nModerators have special authority; they are responsible for this forum. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.\n\nWhen you see bad behavior, don’t reply. Replying encourages bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. Just flag it. If enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.\n\nIn order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts; the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.\n\nAlways Be Civil\n\nNothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:\n\nBe civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.\n\nKeep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.\n\nRespect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.\n\nRespect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.\n\nThese are not concrete terms with precise definitions — avoid even the appearance of any of these things. If you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of a major news site.\n\nThis is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.\n\nKeep It Tidy\n\nMake the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up. So:\n\nDon’t start a topic in the wrong category; please read the category definitions.\n\nDon’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.\n\nDon’t post no-content replies.\n\nDon’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.\n\nDon’t sign your posts — every post has your profile information attached to it.\n\nRather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button. Rather than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction, use Reply as a Linked Topic.\n\nPost Only Your Own Stuff\n\nYou may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission. You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone’s intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.\n\nPowered by You\n\nThis site is operated by your friendly local staff and you, the community. If you have any further questions about how things should work here, open a new topic in the site feedback category and let’s discuss!

I worry that the company may be in a downward spiral.\n\nPerhaps I'm just paranoid or it's just my design-inclined brain, but there's just little signs that make me wonder if they're trying to cut costs and at the same time improve revenue where they can. They've merged old RT in with the new and called it \"time analytics\", but didn't do anything to improve the old stuff or even simply make it look like the new UI--same with the old goals and alerts which was a huge headache for me since all of my old alerts started popping up even though they were no longer relevant.\n\nLikewise, the new design of the blog feels half-baked. Some of the new layout is kind of reflective of new design trends, but most of it feels quite antiquated and there's quite a few places with a lack of padding so that elements feel lacking in polish. There have also clearly been some articles being republished, or at least they're putting a spotlight on old ones in the emails.\n\nAnyway, I don't have any conclusive evidence. There are just several things that have me concerned about the future of this product.\n\n## Comment ID lss78t1 with +4 score by [(rt_jp, Reddit, 2024-10-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RescueTime/comments/1g5vqmz/rescuetime_are_you_okay/lss78t1/) (in reply to ID 1g5vqmz):\nAppreciate the check-in... all good over here!  To (hopefully) ease your concerns, I am going to paste a (slightly modified) reply I sent to a recent question on our community page.  As you will see, there's a reason for some of the UX inconsistencies, but we are working to unify those into a much more modern experience.  \n\nRe: the \"cut costs / improve revenue where they can\" - unlike most SaaS companies, our pricing has remained unchanged (not to mention we added a major new feature - Timesheets - and included it in the existing plan for no additional cost). Any more on why you are feeling that way? \n\nThanks for being a part of the community - if you have any suggestions or features you think would be valuable, drop them here or on our community page.

Timesheets was a major release for us and we have heard a lot of positive feedback about how much it helps solve a truly miserable problem - having to track project time.    \n\n**Unifying the RescueTime Experience**  \nAs we discussed before, in 2021, we released a new version of RescueTime to simplify the user experience. While there were many positive changes, especially on the technical/design side, we heard from users that some key features of the traditional experience were missing, like advanced reporting and data trends. In 2024, we started to combine the best aspects of the traditional RescueTime with the modern version (desktop assistant, universal Focus Sessions, modern web experience). So far, in 2024 we have:\n\n- Opened up the traditional Time Analytics dashboard and reports for newer RescueTime users (accessible via the mode menu next to the logo)\n\n- Built a new Goals and Alerts interface, including the addition of Timesheet project goals\n\n- Updated the Windows desktop assistant for better handling of closing and minimizing\n\n- Fixed the desktop assistant issues related to unnecessary sounds\n\n- Improved the cross-device Focus Session experience, so starting a Focus Session on desktop will block apps on iOS\n\n- Updated our logo \n\nAnd coming soon…\n\n- Modernizing the design and UX of the traditional RescueTime elements (note, we are planning to release these as we finish them, so things may look a little inconsistent from a UX perspective until the work is complete).  \n\n- Streamlining the Focus Session start process into a single screen in the desktop assistant\n\n\n\nOur team remains super motivated and working hard every day to enhance your experience.

As a user for several years, thank you for that!\n\nI agree that the features you mentioned in your original post are important. As my employer has been asking us to keep track of our project time more, I have found Timesheets to definitely be invaluable for me when I forget to start a timer!\n\nPersonally, the “newer” assistant still feels rough around the edges. Maybe I need to check for an update, though, because I still feel like I have some weird issues with closing and minimizing. Also, sometimes it feels like the alerts can be delayed. I will be doing distracting activities, but sometimes by the time the alert pops up I’ve already moved onto something else. I don’t know what can be done about this since I know that there is going to be some inherent delay if the assistant has to communicate back and forth with the server; likewise, I’m wondering if this issue might be exacerbated when I’m doing distracting activities on my phone.\n\nBack to the cost cutting point, at the time when I wrote this there were several aspects of the blog that when combined gave me the impression that there was a lack of care and polish with that facet of the company. In particular, there was a guest post that appeared to be republished. I don’t have an inherent problem with this, but most, if not all, of the links in the post no longer worked. I’d say this was the catalyst for me writing this post on Reddit. I have been frustrated with little things here and there with RT for a little while now, but trying to read a post and not being able to actually take action on the information it was providing brought everything to a head for me, I suppose.\n\nAnyway, thank you again for taking the time to respond. I did not expect anyone from RescueTime to actually reply. I was just venting and was interested to see if any other users were noticing something similar.\n\n## Comment ID lsguneg with +1 score by [(raider708-, Reddit, 2024-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RescueTime/comments/1g5vqmz/rescuetime_are_you_okay/lsguneg/) (in reply to ID 1g5vqmz):\nI’m completely new to rescue time, but i just subscribed to their 2 week trial based on the timesheets feature, which seems simple and perfect for a freelancer like me.

      "# Post ID 1hag6in: Honest Review of RescueTime with +9 score by [(Otherwise_Day_8921, Reddit, 2024-12-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TimeTrackingSoftware/comments/1hag6in/honest_review_of_rescuetime/)\nThe review of RescueTime highlights its strengths and weaknesses as a time tracking tool. RescueTime is widely regarded for its simplicity and automatic tracking, offering users valuable insights into how their time is spent. It’s especially praised for its FocusTime feature, which blocks distractions and helps users stay on task. The app runs seamlessly in the background, providing easy-to-understand reports and helping you boost productivity.\n\nHowever, the review also points out some limitations. RescueTime lacks key project management tools such as invoicing, task tracking, and shift scheduling, making it less suitable for businesses or teams. The mobile app, while functional, has been criticized for glitches and performance issues, which make it less reliable than the desktop version. Additionally, some users have raised privacy concerns due to the level of activity tracking.\n\nRescueTime remains a strong option for individual users looking to boost their productivity and improve time management. But if you're looking for a more comprehensive solution for business or team management, it might be worth considering alternatives like Jibble, which offers a broader set of features tailored to business needs.\n\nRead the full honest review of [RescueTime](https://hubs.li/Q033s4qh0).\n\n## Comment ID m18ln8b with +7 score by [(disguisedemployer, Reddit, 2024-12-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TimeTrackingSoftware/comments/1hag6in/honest_review_of_rescuetime/m18ln8b/) (in reply to ID 1hag6in):\nyeah, I agree.

I made myself a Google Form that has a fill-in box for me to write what I was doing and a multiple choice question for me to tape on a category.\n2. I downloaded To Do Reminder, which is an Android app.  In it, I set up a reminder to go off every however many minutes (you can set a repeating one) and where it in the reminder set up window, it says \"write a short note,\" I copied and pasted the link to my Google Form.\n\nSo every X minutes, a notification from the app pops up on my phone with a clickable link to that Google Form, so I tap on the link, answer the two google form questions, and that's it.\n\nSimple enough, but MAN it was hard to find a reminder app that would go off forever at random intervals and that could include a clickable link.\n\n## Comment ID iuqip4m with +7 score by [(nielsmouthaan, Reddit, 2022-11-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/yjt1wh/time_tracking_apps/iuqip4m/) (in reply to ID yjt1wh):\n[Daily](https://dailytimetracking.com) sounds precisely what you're looking for.

      "# [Chrome: This extension is no longer available because it doesn't follow best practices for Chrome extensions on 2024-12-26](https://community.rescuetime.com/t/chrome-this-extension-is-no-longer-available-because-it-doesnt-follow-best-practices-for-chrome-extensions/1280)\nHey Patadeloso!\n\nAs you may know, Chrome is rolling out changes to extensions that will impact many extensions, including ours. The good news is that you don’t need the Chrome extension for RescueTime to work properly.\n\nIf you’ve installed the Windows or Mac desktop app, your time spent on websites in Chrome will still be tracked. The only users significantly affected by this change are Chromebook users, which represent a very small portion of our user base.\n\nWe’ll revisit our approach to the Chrome extension down the road, but for now, since it’s not critical to RescueTime’s functionality, we’re holding off on significant development until the situation stabilizes.\n\nThanks for your understanding!\n\nBest,\n\nJP\n\n@jpmyers You say that the only usecase this affects are Chromebook users but that’s not quite true. I have had to switch from a Macbook to a Linux-operated laptop for my work, and as you’ll probably know the Rescuetime desktop app is not available for Linux users. I was hoping to mitigate against this by at least tracking my online time with the browser extension, but appears that’s not possible either because Google has disabled the extension for Chrome? Feel like I’m being squeezed on both sides and if I can’t find some solutions my annual RescueTime subscription might soon start looking a lot less useful…",
      "# [Team Reports on 2024-06-20](https://help.rescuetime.com/article/35-team-reports)\nIn addition to the individual Premium reports accessible by each member of your team, RescueTime for Teams provides special team reports. The group reports in RescueTime for Teams will help your team members visualize their cumulative time and understand how they are working together as a group. These reports include rollup statistics about how time was spent in different categories at different times of the day or week. If Key Tools are configured, your team can also see how much time they spend using specific tools.\n\nGroup reports are accessible by everyone on the team\n\nThe reports are a tool for the entire group to see how they are working as a team. As such, they are available to all members. It lets individuals see benchmarks of team norms, and helps them understand their place in the group.\n\nTime-tracking systems within an organization often raise questions by those being tracked. Team members may worry about being \"spied on\". The best ways to address any concerns is to show potential team members what data is available in the reports and to remind them that RescueTime is not designed to be employee monitoring software. It is both a tool to help managers make smart choices about the overall team time-management strategy and a source of valuable information for the individuals on the team.\n\nIndividual data is not accessible in the group reports\n\nThe group reports only contain anonymized, aggregated information about how the team as a whole is spending its time. A manager cannot view an individual's private details or activities. Group time is aggregated, and in most cases rolled up to the category level. Key Tools are the only activities that will be displayed explicitly in team reports. This helps ensure the privacy of your team members and cuts down on a lot of noise that would make your reports less oriented toward the goal of increasing productivity as a team.\n\nAccessing Team Settings\n\nTeam settings are found in the drop down menu under the Tools icon:\n\nAccessing the group reports\n\nYou can access the group reports by clicking Reports in the top navigation, and choose Your Team:\n\nSummary Report\n\nThe summary report gives a high-level overview of how your team is spending its time. You will be able to see the total time logged for the team, the time by day, top categories and key tools, and a breakdown of patterns throughout the day. You can adjust the date and time frame using the date controls at the top of the page. You can also view time by day, week, month, or year.\n\nCategories Report\n\nThe categories report shows a detailed analysis of how time is spent across different categories. For the selected period you can see the total time in each category as well as a breakdown of how that time was spent during particular hours, days or weeks.\n\nKey Tools Report\n\nThe Key Tools report shows a detailed breakdown of how time is spent in the different key tools you have configured. For the selected period, you can see the total time in each key tool as well as a breakdown of how that time was spent across hours, days, or weeks. You can configure your key tools on the Tracking Settings page: https://www.rescuetime.com/sponsors/tracking_settings\n\nPlease note: As owner or administrator, you would set up the categories for the Key Tool activities for your team. However, your team member can change this category in their own reports. This will not alter the team reports. Suppose your team member decides to change a category in their own reports. In that case, this time will still be accounted for and applied to the category you originally set for the Key Tool activity and therefore be included in the team reports.\n\nDid this answer your question?

      "# [Honest RescueTime Review by a Competitor by Jibble.io on 2023-12-09](https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime)\nBy Asim Qureshi, CEO Jibble\n\nAs a CEO of a time tracking software company I need to know what my competitors are up to. That means my team and I are often researching about and/or playing around with their products, you know, it’s part of the job. Here, I share my findings of that research, giving credit to those competitors where credit is due and being honest about which products I believe you really need to avoid. And so, there you have it, this review, and in it, I try to be honest, fair, and insightful. I hope it helps you make the right decision…\n\nThis Review Covers:\n\nOverview\n\nWhat Do Users Like About RescueTime?\n\nWhat Don’t Users Like About RescueTime?\n\nWhat Pricing Plans Does RescueTime Offer?\n\nWhat are the Standout Features of RescueTime?\n\nSelected Positive User Feedback\n\nSelected Negative User Feedback\n\nWhat are RescueTime’s Ratings from Review Sites?\n\nWhat’s My Final Verdict on RescueTime?\n\nOverview\n\nRescueTime is a time management and analytics tool designed to help workers boost efficiency and productivity.\n\nIt automatically tracks time and activities from a user’s device, gathering data on application names, web site URLs, window titles, start time of use, and end time of use. This data is then organized into reports which can be viewed on the app, exported as a CSV file, or sent directly to your email.\n\nOther features that RescueTime is equipped with include Goal Tracking, FocusTime, Timesheets, and custom alerts and notifications.\n\nMy favorite feature on RescueTime has got to be FocusTime, which blocks all the websites classified by the user as personal or distracting. Whether it’s social media, streaming platforms, or online shopping, FocusTime empowers users to reduce interruptions and create a more focused work environment.\n\nWhile the software does work well as an activity analysis software, it lacks some very important features for time tracking and work management.\n\nTo name a few, RescueTime does not have cost calculation, invoicing, scheduling, GPS tracking, or biometric options for clock ins. While it is a valuable productivity enhancement tool, it is not a time and work management solution for freelancers and businesses who need more than just the analytics that RescueTime provides.\n\nAside from these limitations, RescueTime doesn’t do well on mobile. Users have encountered bugs that have led to syncing issues and loss of tracked data. Other times the app would just completely stop working. These issues explain it’s terribly low rating on both the Google Play Store (3.3/5) and App Store (2.7/5).\n\nThere’s definitely a number of pros and cons to using RescueTime. And before you decide if it’s the right tool for you, it’s important to weight them properly. To get a clearer picture, let’s dive deeper into the app’s standout features and what else users have to say.\n\nWhat Do Users Like About RescueTime?\n\nAutomatic time tracking\n\nExcellent productivity analysis\n\nGreat for reducing distractions\n\nFind more on what users love about RescueTime.\n\nWhat Don't Users Like About RescueTime?\n\nData syncing issues\n\nOnly supports English language option\n\nUI needs improvement\n\nMobile syncing and accuracy issues\n\nFind more on what users hate about RescueTime.\n\nWhat Pricing Plans Does RescueTime Offer?\n\nRescueTime has two plan variants: Solo and Team, both plans offering a 14-day free trial.\n\nSolo\n\nThe Solo plan starts at $6.50/month when billed annually and $12/month billed monthly. It offers a comprehensive set of tools designed to help individuals track their time, stay focused, and enhance productivity.\n\nFeatures under the Solo plan include:\n\nAutomatic time-tracking software\n\nTimesheets\n\nProject billable reports\n\nDistraction Blocking and Focus Sessions\n\nReal-time Goals and Alerts\n\nAnalytics and Reporting Tools\n\nWeekly email reports\n\nDesktop, mobile, and browser access\n\nOffline time tracking\n\nDaily highlights\n\nCustom work hours and burnout protection\n\nUnlimited historical data\n\nIntegration with Calendars, Asana, Slack and more\n\nTeam\n\nRescueTime’s Team Plan is priced at $6/month per team member when billed annually and $9/month per team member billed monthly.\n\nThe plan contains very much everything from the Solo plan but with expanded access to streamline productivity and time management for teams. It also includes organization management, consolidated billing for teams, and timesheets for teams.\n\nRead 5 things you MUST know about RescueTime’s pricing.\n\nWhat are the Standout Features of RescueTime?\n\n1. FocusTime\n\nWith the goal of “rescuing” your time, RescueTime has what’s called FocusTime which is basically assisted focus sessions.\n\nWhen FocusTime is enabled, RescueTime automatically blocks out apps and sites categorized as Personal or Distractions. You can customize what to block, set a timer, and work without interruptions.\n\nFocus sessions can be scheduled too, and you’ll get an alert when it’s time to start. When a user enters into a Focus Session, all their devices connected to their RescueTime account will automatically be in focus session as well. Great\n\n2. Activity Tracking\n\nRescueTime’s activity tracking feature works automatically in the background, recording all computer activity a few hours after installation. It tracks the websites and applications you open during your designated tracking periods. For more detailed monitoring, you can configure it to collect specific data like window titles, document names, and URLs.\n\nYou have full control over what RescueTime tracks. You can choose to monitor only specific websites or programs by adding them to a whitelist, while other activities are recorded under general categories like “browsing.” You can also ignore certain applications entirely if they’re not relevant to your productivity tracking.\n\n3. Productivity Pulse\n\nRescueTime’s Productivity Pulse is a simple yet effective tool for tracking productivity. It uses charts to display a productivity score out of 100, calculated based on how users spend their time over a specific period.\n\nThe score is a time-weighted average of five activity categories, ranging from Focused Work Time to Distracting Time. This makes it easy to understand how effectively time is being utilized.\n\nThe visual representation helps users quickly assess their productivity, track their progress, and set goals to improve.\n\nSelected Positive User Feedback\n\nEasy to understand tracked data on the dashboard. Visual charts are impactful & very helpful. – Jem F. (Source: Capterra)\n\n“Its the best app which helps me to set goals and also in time tracking. It has the feature of automatic time tracking which helps us to understand the hours we worked.” – Verified User in Accounting (Source: G2)\n\n“One of the most useful aspects of RescueTime is its ability to automatically track the time I spend on different apps and websites without the need for manual intervention. This helps me get an accurate and objective picture of my work day without extra effort, the biggest time savings I have is with these features.” – Verified Reviewer (Source: Capterra)\n\n“This tool for our team has been an eye-opening tool for tracking and improving productivity. Its automatic time tracking feature helps users understand how they spend their time on the computer and mobile devices..” – Fernando L. (Source: Capterra)\n\n“The best thing about RescueTime is how after setup you simply forget about it. It works 100% without interaction and at the end of each day you have a comprehensive report on all the activities you performed.” – Lucas P. (Source: Capterra)\n\n“The ease of use is the best of that tool. Without having to remember to start a task or something, it silently records what you are doing in the background.” – Christian H. (Source: Capterra)\n\nSelected Negative User Feedback\n\n“Great … when it works. I’ve used RT for a few years now and it’s been really useful in helping me to monitor how I spend my time online. Problem is that every few months it stops syncing data. Support was OK but recently I send in reports and get no response. Only solutions they offer is to uninstall and reinstall but that loses data and it doesn’t fix the issue. Works fine on desktop but very poor on tablet & phone.” – R Stimson (Source: Google Play Store)\n\n“Can’t use with 2fa, which is insane. RescueTime carries sensitive data that tracks everything I do, so I’m incredulous that they don’t provide the barest of protections for that data.” – T.D. Eastvold (Source: Google Play Store)\n\n“The phone app looks very dated and needs a big UI upgrade, the web app is very nice and informative, I really wish the app could replicate what the web app can do.” – Dinerty (Source: Google Play Store)\n\n“If it works, this app is great. But most of the time it’s busy freezing, crashing or simply not tracking any app activity. ” – Eric (Source: Google Play Store)\n\n“Would like to see better integration between the mobile app and the Windows app, for example, focus times could force the same Android actions automagically. ” – Geoffrey T. (Source: G2)\n\n“It collects all the data and sends storage to its server. I often worry about the data privacy issues with this software, Have to evaluate the tradeoff.” – Tom V. (Source: G2)\n\nWhat are RescueTime's Review Ratings from Review Sites?\n\nAs of January 2025\n\nCapterra: 4.6/5\n\nG2: 4.1/5\n\nTrustRadius: 7.9/10\n\nGetApp: 4.6/5\n\nGoogle Play Store: 3.3/5\n\nApp Store: 2.7/5\n\nWhat's My Final Verdict on RescueTime?\n\nRescueTime is really more of a productivity app than a time tracking software.\n\nIt offers a clear and honest reflection of users’ work habits by meticulously tracking activities from the start to the end of their workday. I like how the data is categorized into user-defined groups and ranked on a five-point productivity scale, ranging from very productive to very distracting. This helps users evaluate their time usage and make necessary adjustments to build healthier productivity habits over time.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that RescueTime is not a replacement for dedicated work management and time tracking tools. It lacks essential features like shift scheduling, billing and invoicing, project progress tracking, and accountability safeguards. While its detailed analytics are impressive, they may overwhelm users seeking simpler, more straightforward reporting.\n\nRescueTime’s unimpessive mobile app is a huge downside too, especially for users who rely on their phones for on-the-go productivity tracking.\n\nIf what you’re after is robust time tracking software with comprehensive features for managing projects and teams, there are other tools on the market that might offer a better fit.",
      "# [Installing RescueTime for Firefox on 2024-07-11](https://help.rescuetime.com/article/115-installing-rescuetime-for-firefox)\nIf you are on Mac OS and using Firefox, you'll need to use the browser plugin for full functionality (ie browser details).

      "# [Monitoring Options on 2024-05-31](https://help.rescuetime.com/article/45-monitoring-options)\nRescueTime offers a wide variety of monitoring options, which can be accessed by navigating to the Privacy page under Account Settings > Data & Privacy\n\nLogging Details\n\nYou can choose whether RescueTime collects full window titles and document information for applications as well as choose the activity details for email programs.\n\nOnly Monitor Specific Websites\n\nBy default, RescueTime monitors all websites and all applications that you use.\n\nTo monitor only specific websites you would toggle the Monitor all websites option off and then click on the Manage Whitelist link.\n\nYou can choose to limit which sites are monitored. This \"whitelist\" will be pushed to your computer, effectively telling the data collector on your machine to submit all websites on this list as normal, but record all NON-whitelisted websites as generic browser time. This offers complete privacy for sites not on the list. RescueTime simply never receives any site-specific data for non-whitelisted sites.\n\nIgnore Activities\n\nRescueTime also allows you to ignore specific applications selectively. We strongly discourage this, as it can skew data dramatically. However, this feature can be used for virtual machine applications like VMWare (where you can ignore VMWare and choose to install RescueTime on the virtual machine).\n\nYou can ignore an activity from your Apps & Websites Report. We share details on how to ignore apps and websites here.\n\nYou can manage your ignored activities from your Data & Privacy page.\n\nLogging Schedule\n\nYou can specify which days and times of the week you want to monitor your activities. You can enable RescueTime to monitor your activities all day.\n\nIf you choose to define days and times, then toggle the 24 x 7 option off and click on the Manage Logging Schedule link.\n\nRescueTime will record events only during the days and times you selected. Outside of those hours, you'll notice that the RescueTime icon is grayed out.",

      "# [RescueTime: Dive into Efficiency [with RescueTime vs Everhour] on 2025-03-19](https://everhour.com/blog/rescuetime-vs-everhour-examining-the-two/)\nMany organizations now apply the best time tracking practices to monitor employee activity and measure team performance to improve business operations. Thanks to time tracking tools, such as RescueTime, monitoring and improving productivity has never been easier. This article will shed light on RescueTime – its main features, pricing, pros & cons, tips and tricks, and compare two popular tools to determine which time tracker will be on top: RescueTime vs Everhour.\n\nWhat Is RescueTime?\n\nWe’ll begin by exploring RescueTime. The tool was created to tackle some of the problems present in the modern workplace, namely, stress, reduced productivity, and burnout. One of the best ways to improve your productivity is to understand how you spend your time, so you can make necessary adjustments. RescueTime tracks your activity on a computer or mobile device and then provides you with insights into how you spend your time.\n\nRescueTime Features\n\nRescue time provides users with a variety of useful features, which we’ll explore in more detail.\n\n🚜 Activity tracking\n\nOne of RescueTime’s best features is its activity-tracking feature. It lets users see exactly what their team members have been doing each day. The feature tracks the time a user spends on a particular website, app, or even a specific document, allowing management to review their team members’ working habits and make adjustments if necessary.\n\n🔖 Activity labeling\n\nOnce RescueTime has collected the necessary data about how you use your time, it will categorize it into how productive it is on a scale with five different productivity levels. Some websites may be deemed as distracting in some roles and productive in others. For example, scrolling through your company’s news website is part of your job if you’re a journalist. As a result, you can mark certain websites as productive rather than distracting.\n\n❗ Work goals and distraction blockers\n\nRescueTime enables you to set a personal daily work goal and allows you to block distractions when necessary during what the platform calls a ‘focus session’. The app tracks what you’re working on and will alert you when you’re beginning to lose focus or trying to work on too many tasks at one time.\n\n📊 Dashboard\n\nThis data is then presented on a dashboard. It gives you a productivity pulse and measures your productivity compared to the previous day. Additionally, the dashboard presents your activities by color: blue being productive, grey as neither productive nor distracted, and red as distracted.

Here, I will discuss seven key differences between these two popular tools.\n\nAccess Controls\n\nRescueTime: RescueTime provides a more individual-focused approach where users can control access to their own data. This tool is primarily designed for personal productivity tracking, and therefore, it offers limited access controls compared to team-centric tools. Users can manage their data privacy settings and choose which activities are tracked.\n\nClockify: Clockify, on the other hand, is designed with team collaboration in mind, offering extensive access controls and permissions. Team managers can assign roles and permissions, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive project data. This is particularly useful for larger teams where data security and controlled access are paramount.\n\nDifferentiation Point: Clockify’s comprehensive access control features make it more suitable for team environments, while RescueTime’s simplicity caters to individual users focusing on personal productivity.\n\nAutomatic Time Capture\n\nRescueTime: One of the core features of RescueTime is its automatic time tracking. It records the time spent on applications and websites without requiring any manual input. This helps users understand their work patterns and identify productivity bottlenecks. The tool runs unobtrusively in the background, ensuring that users can focus on their tasks without interruptions.\n\nClockify: Clockify also offers automatic time capture, but it requires users to start and stop timers manually if they prefer a more hands-on approach. It provides detailed insights into time spent on various tasks and projects, which is particularly beneficial for billing and project management. Users can also use the auto-tracker feature, which starts and stops tracking based on computer usage.\n\nDifferentiation Point: RescueTime’s fully automated tracking is ideal for users who prefer a hands-off approach, while Clockify offers both automated and manual tracking options, providing greater flexibility for different workflows.\n\nEmployee Database\n\nRescueTime: RescueTime is designed primarily for individual use and does not include features for managing an employee database. It focuses on personal productivity metrics and does not offer functionalities for storing or managing employee information.\n\nClockify: Clockify includes an employee database feature, allowing organizations to store and manage information about their team members. This is particularly useful for larger teams or companies that need to keep track of employee details, assign tasks, and monitor productivity across different projects.\n\nDifferentiation Point: Clockify’s ability to manage an employee database makes it a more suitable choice for businesses and teams, whereas RescueTime is tailored to individual productivity tracking.\n\nHistorical Reporting\n\nRescueTime: RescueTime offers detailed historical reporting that helps users analyze their productivity trends over time. Users can generate reports that show how their time was spent across different activities, providing valuable insights into their work habits and areas for improvement.\n\nClockify: Clockify excels in providing comprehensive historical reporting for teams and projects. It allows users to generate various types of reports, including time, expense, and project reports. These reports can be customized and exported, making it easy to share insights with stakeholders.\n\nDifferentiation Point: While both tools offer historical reporting, Clockify’s robust reporting features are better suited for team and project management, whereas RescueTime focuses on individual productivity insights.\n\nIdle Time Monitoring\n\nRescueTime: RescueTime includes idle time monitoring to ensure that the time tracked is productive. It detects periods of inactivity and adjusts the recorded time accordingly, helping users get an accurate picture of their active work hours.\n\nClockify: Clockify also offers idle time detection, allowing users to manage their time entries more accurately. If no activity is detected for a specified period, Clockify prompts the user to decide whether to keep or discard the idle time.\n\nDifferentiation Point: Both tools provide idle time monitoring, but Clockify’s interactive prompts offer users more control over their time entries.\n\nMilestone Tracking\n\nRescueTime: RescueTime does not offer specific features for milestone tracking as it focuses more on overall productivity and time management rather than project management.\n\nClockify: Clockify includes milestone tracking as part of its project management capabilities. Users can set milestones for projects, track progress, and ensure that important deadlines are met. This feature is particularly useful for managing complex projects with multiple phases.\n\nDifferentiation Point: Clockify’s milestone tracking makes it a more comprehensive tool for project management, whereas RescueTime is geared towards individual productivity.\n\nOnline Time Tracking\n\nRescueTime: RescueTime’s primary function is to track online and offline activities automatically. It logs the time spent on various websites and applications, helping users identify distractions and focus on productive tasks.\n\nClockify: Clockify offers online time tracking with the ability to manually start and stop timers or use the auto-tracker. It provides detailed logs of online activities, making it easy to manage time spent on different projects and tasks.\n\nDifferentiation Point: While both tools offer online time tracking, Clockify’s flexibility with manual and automatic options caters to diverse user preferences.\n\nAs per my analysis, both RescueTime and Clockify have their unique strengths, with RescueTime excelling in individual productivity tracking and Clockify offering robust features for team and project management.
