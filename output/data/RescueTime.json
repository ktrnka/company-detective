      "# [Privacy Policy](https://www.rescuetime.com/privacy)\nMost recent version: January 22, 2025.\n\nBy using RescueTime, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your personal information for the purposes of providing you our product services as described below. We will notify all active accounts of any significant changes to this policy.\n\nYour data is never shared\n\nYour privacy is really important to us. At RescueTime, your data, analyzed, is the product we offer back to you. We are not an ad supported company. Our free service is intended to entice you to premium service. If you have any concerns that aren't covered here, please contact us. Below are the details of this policy:\n\nWe will never sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal information, with or without personally identifying information. Furthermore, we will never share anonymized selections of your individual data. That includes any government (foreign or domestic) unless we are compelled by law. If we are required by law to disclose any of the information collected about you, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email. We will independently object to overly broad requests for access to information about users of our site.\n\nWe may share information about user behavior in the aggregate only. For example, we could share information like, \"which day of the week do people spend the most time in front of their computer?\" This type of analysis is used to enrich the product, and to represent our domain expertise to our audiences.\n\nYou can delete your data at any time — all of it, or just a slice of it. You can also delete your account at any time. Deleting your account deletes all your data from our database.\n\nWe won't spam you, ever, either directly or indirectly by sharing of email information. We might occasionally send one-time messages about important RescueTime news. We will likely continue to introduce ways that you can optionally have RescueTime contact you with data that you care about, but you will always be able to turn this on or off.\n\nFor individual accounts, no other user can see any of your data or personal information. We may provide features to allow you to share selections of your data, but this will be voluntary and opt-in only, and handled per-situation, and not buried in a terms of service.\n\nFor team accounts, sharing of data is controlled by the administrator of the account and by default does not allow anyone in the team account access to your data. No one outside of your organization will have access to any of your data. Default team implementations do not permit the sharing of individual data in any form that is not aggregated (eg, your team's average communication per week). When consulting with team implementations, we promote transparency and user driven control.\n\nHow do we protect your data?\n\nYour data is always encrypted in transit. All requests with the RescueTime web app and client apps are encrypted with current best practice SSL configurations.\n\nYour data is always encrypted at rest. All of our storage uses volume encryption.\n\nWe maintain ongoing vulnerability scanning, respond immediately to security advisories, and stay PCI compliant.\n\nWhat information does RescueTime collect? How is it used?\n\nAccount information includes email address (verification optional), city, state, and country. Optional demographic information includes gender, date of birth, industry, job title, company size, and income may be requested, to enrich the accuracy of our reporting for your work patterns.\n\nRescueTime records information about the currently active application or website on your computer. We record for processing the following information: 1) for time analysis: application name, web site URL, window title, start time of use, end time of use and 2) for distinguishing you and your device: device login name (your system user name), device name, device operating system version, and sometimes the manufacturer. For some inputs, the public internet address you are operating from is saved, for your security (and ours), and for troubleshooting. Like all activity information, it is discarded with account deletion.\n\nWe do not (and never will) collect keystrokes, form input, screenshots, window or page body content, or anything nefarious. Before storage for your reports, URLs are trimmed to the site name and sometimes top level directory when a site has distinct web apps. Query strings are discarded. Site controls allow you to selectively delete and ignore forever any item you prefer not be stored.\n\nData Retention, Deletion and Account Removal\n\nAll your data is destroyed in its entirety when you delete your account, except account activity logs required for business audit records. This process can take up to 3 days to protect against accidental deletion. Users can request immediate deletion by contacting support.\n\nYou can selectively delete portions of your activity data at any time on our website via activity reports.\n\nYou can delete all of your own activity data at any time on our website in the Data & Privacy section of account settings, by clicking \"Erase your logged time\".\n\nYou can delete your account, which also deletes all of your activity data, by clicking \"Delete your account\" on the Data & Privacy section of account settings.\n\nFree account user data older than 15 months is automatically deleted on a continuous basis.\n\nCookies and Log Files\n\nRescueTime.com sends a \"cookie\" to your computer that contains an identifier that is unique to your browser session. We use this cookie to validate your authentication, provide you with a continuous experience, and to record how our site/service is being used. It is not used for marketing purposes.\n\nAs is done with most web sites, we log each visit to each web page. A log entry can contain information typically found in the \"header\" of your web browser's request such as the browser type you used, your Internet Protocol address, and the date and time of day. We may also log your session identifier and the URL of a site that referred you. This log information is important for security, audit, quality improvement, as well as for monitoring the health of our service.",
      "# [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/security)\nInfrastructure and Platform: Safe Foundations\n\nA secure design for hardware, networks, and deployments.\n\nTo make RescueTime work, there are two principle components: the application that runs on your device and the cloud-based service that processes the data and builds results for you. The client runs on multiple platforms and devices (Windows, Apple OS X, Linux, Android, ChromeOS), and is principally responsible for automatically measuring how the device is used. The client also offers some additional user-facing features that are best delivered outside the browser. The cloud service receives data from the client and also provides the client with statistics and configuration information to enrich the user's experience and manage client features.\n\nThe Client Application Platform\n\nFor desktop systems, the client is built on a common codebase using standard cross-platform libraries that work across Windows, OS X and Linux. This encompasses the code used for secure communication with our servers, as well as configuration handling and time logic. We maintain our client with regular updates, publish change information, audit and test all changes, and track dependent library security updates. Our client is designed to be lightweight, with a negligible memory and processor footprint, using a compact codebase and minimized complexity to reduce risk.\n\nFor mobile systems, we currently support automatic time collection on Android devices, including phones and tablets. Our app is built entirely inside the Android SDK and so takes advantage of the Google Android team's own security provisions (app sandboxing, regular platform maintenance updates, etc).\n\nMore about how the client works >>\n\nThe Cloud Service Platform\n\nRescueTime data processing, reporting, and account management is handled through our website locations, which are all hosted on Amazon's EC2 facility. Out of the box, EC2 gives us audited robust infrastructure security, both physical and network level. On that foundation, we provide additional feature-targeted firewalling, privilege separation and controls, two-factor access methods, and logged, auditable operations interfaces. Our website services are built on common open-source platforms, apps and frameworks that we monitor for regular security maintenance updates, both at the operating system level and for required apps and libraries.\n\nAll operational interaction with our platform is accomplished through either HTTPS or SSH (secure tunnels). Our testing and development deployments are maintained in a matching configuration, with access only through HTTPS and SSH tunnels. We do not maintain any office based data storage or services. All of our engineering resources are secured in EC2 under the same practices and policies applied to the production configuration.\n\nMore about the site and web services >>\n\nRescueTime and HIPAA, HITECH, SAS70 and more\n\nHow regulations and policies may affect you.\n\nHIPAA / HITECH: privacy and security requirements\n\nWe have clients, including individuals and teams, in many different lines of business. Some have concerns driven by protection of intellectual property, others have regulatory requirements. For those under HIPAA compliance standards for their software purchases:\n\nIs it even required? HIPAA requirements are triggered when a software product maintains patient identifiable information. For this reason, your use of RescueTime would likely be covered by HIPAA, because some applications' window titles may have a patient's name or similar small but identifiable detail. It would be possible to take advantage of our privacy configurations and controls to restrict what is captured and measured, to prevent this requirement altogether while using RescueTime. However, this may limit the utility of the product to you.\n\n... So, assuming you need HIPAA compliance to use RescueTime:\n\nSecure network transmission: HIPAA requires that all transmission of data between your business or our software be encrypted. RescueTime meets this requirement.\n\nPhysical security: The service must be hosted in an access limited and monitored facility. RescueTime meets this requirement by maintaining all resources in Amazon's EC2 data center.\n\nAccess control: Operational access to the service must be secured for authorized use only and be auditable. RescueTime meets this requirement.\n\nSafe practices and policies: The service should maintain disaster recovery plans and offsite backups. RescueTime meets this requirement, primarily by leveraging features of Amazon's EC2 service.\n\nThe HITECH supplement requires SaaS products to report intrusion or security events that effect customers' data. Specifically, the requirement is that if customer data resides in storage unencrypted (for example, a backup), even in a secured environment, that the service provider (us) must notify all and any customers whose data could have been vulnerable as the result of an intrusion event or other security violation. RescueTime guarantees its customers that it will alert any and all customers possibly affected by a security defect or hacking event.\n\nNote: At this time, RescueTime has not contracted an audit firm to provide third party validation of compliance. Please contact sales@rescuetime.com for more information on how we can accommodate your needs.\n\nSAS70 and the rest\n\nRescueTime is a fast growing business, and we contract services as needed as we continue to grow. As of this time we have not engaged our own SAS70 audit. Much of what these audits require is covered simply by operating on EC2. However, the web site services above and beyond the platform level is not. We are happy to consider all questions regarding obtaining audits. We have some clients that perform their own tests against our system to ensure we meet their standards.",

We will notify all active accounts of any significant changes to this policy.\n\nYour data is never shared\n\nYour privacy is really important to us. At RescueTime, your data, analyzed, is the product we offer back to you. We are not an ad supported company. Our free service is intended to entice you to premium service. If you have any concerns that aren't covered here, please contact us. Below are the details of this policy:\n\nWe will never sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal information, with or without personally identifying information. Furthermore, we will never share anonymized selections of your individual data. That includes any government (foreign or domestic) unless we are compelled by law. If we are required by law to disclose any of the information collected about you, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email. We will independently object to overly broad requests for access to information about users of our site.\n\nWe may share information about user behavior in the aggregate only. For example, we could share information like, \"which day of the week do people spend the most time in front of their computer?\" This type of analysis is used to enrich the product, and to represent our domain expertise to our audiences.\n\nYou can delete your data at any time — all of it, or just a slice of it. You can also delete your account at any time. Deleting your account deletes all your data from our database.\n\nWe won't spam you, ever, either directly or indirectly by sharing of email information. We might occasionally send one-time messages about important RescueTime news. We will likely continue to introduce ways that you can optionally have RescueTime contact you with data that you care about, but you will always be able to turn this on or off.\n\nFor individual accounts, no other user can see any of your data or personal information. We may provide features to allow you to share selections of your data, but this will be voluntary and opt-in only, and handled per-situation, and not buried in a terms of service.\n\nFor team accounts, sharing of data is controlled by the administrator of the account and by default does not allow anyone in the team account access to your data. No one outside of your organization will have access to any of your data. Default team implementations do not permit the sharing of individual data in any form that is not aggregated (eg, your team's average communication per week). When consulting with team implementations, we promote transparency and user driven control.\n\nHow do we protect your data?\n\nYour data is always encrypted in transit. All requests with the RescueTime web app and client apps are encrypted with current best practice SSL configurations.\n\nYour data is always encrypted at rest. All of our storage uses volume encryption.\n\nWe maintain ongoing vulnerability scanning, respond immediately to security advisories, and stay PCI compliant.\n\nWhat information does RescueTime collect? How is it used?\n\nAccount information includes email address (verification optional), city, state, and country. Optional demographic information includes gender, date of birth, industry, job title, company size, and income may be requested, to enrich the accuracy of our reporting for your work patterns.\n\nRescueTime records information about the currently active application or website on your computer. We record for processing the following information: 1) for time analysis: application name, web site URL, window title, start time of use, end time of use and 2) for distinguishing you and your device: device login name (your system user name), device name, device operating system version, and sometimes the manufacturer. For some inputs, the public internet address you are operating from is saved, for your security (and ours), and for troubleshooting. Like all activity information, it is discarded with account deletion.\n\nWe do not (and never will) collect keystrokes, form input, screenshots, window or page body content, or anything nefarious. Before storage for your reports, URLs are trimmed to the site name and sometimes top level directory when a site has distinct web apps. Query strings are discarded. Site controls allow you to selectively delete and ignore forever any item you prefer not be stored.\n\nData Retention, Deletion and Account Removal\n\nAll your data is destroyed in its entirety when you delete your account, except account activity logs required for business audit records. This process can take up to 3 days to protect against accidental deletion. Users can request immediate deletion by contacting support.\n\nYou can selectively delete portions of your activity data at any time on our website via activity reports.\n\nYou can delete all of your own activity data at any time on our website in the Data & Privacy section of account settings, by clicking \"Erase your logged time\".\n\nYou can delete your account, which also deletes all of your activity data, by clicking \"Delete your account\" on the Data & Privacy section of account settings.\n\nFree account user data older than 15 months is automatically deleted on a continuous basis.\n\nCookies and Log Files\n\nRescueTime.com sends a \"cookie\" to your computer that contains an identifier that is unique to your browser session. We use this cookie to validate your authentication, provide you with a continuous experience, and to record how our site/service is being used. It is not used for marketing purposes.\n\nAs is done with most web sites, we log each visit to each web page. A log entry can contain information typically found in the \"header\" of your web browser's request such as the browser type you used, your Internet Protocol address, and the date and time of day. We may also log your session identifier and the URL of a site that referred you. This log information is important for security, audit, quality improvement, as well as for monitoring the health of our service.",
      "# [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/rtx/developers)\nConnecting to the RescueTime API\n\nThere are two ways to connect to a user’s data in RescueTime, via API Keys or via an Oauth2 Connection. The API keys are ideal for personal use, while web services wishing to offer a way for their users to use their RescueTime data should use an Oauth2 connection.\n\nAPI Key Access:\n\nUsers can set up an API key by going to their key management page and creating a new key. That key must be included with each API request. The user can revoke keys at any time.\n\nOauth2 Connection Access:\n\nPlease contact us and we’ll work with you to set up an Oauth2 application. After the user connects their account via Oauth2, an access token will be created. That access token must be included in each API request. The user can revoke access to a service at any time.\n\nOauth2 Authorization Flow\n\nOnce we have created your Oauth2 application, your app will be assigned a client_id and a client_secret. These tokens can then be used, along with the secure redirect_uri provided in the request for an oauth application, in the following steps to authorize your application's user access to their RescueTime data:\n\nA GET request to the following URL:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&response_type=code&scope=YOUR_SCOPES\n\nThis will return the auth_code, which will expire in 10 minutes.\n\nA POST request to the following URL:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/oauth/token\n\nwith a JSON body of:\n\n{\n\n\"client_id\": YOUR_CLIENT_ID,\n\n\"client_secret\": YOUR_APP_SECRET,\n\n\"grant_type\": \"authorization_code\",\n\n\"code\": AUTH_CODE,\n\n\"redirect_uri\": YOUR_REDIRECT_URI\n\n}\n\nThis will return the access_token\n\nData can then be accessed with the access_token, as shown in this example URL:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/data?access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN&by=interval&taxonomy=productivity&interval=hour&restrict_begin=2018-01-01&restrict_end=2018-01-31&format=json&scopes=time_data\n\nOauth2 Access Scopes\n\nWhen users connect their accounts to your application via Oauth2, you can specify access scopes to let the user know exactly how you will be using their RescueTime data. Scopes will be requested during the initial authorization request.\n\nThe following scopes are currently supported:\n\ntime_data: Access activity history and summary time data or post offline time for the authorized user\n\ncategory_data: Access how much time the authorizing user spent in specific categories\n\nproductivity_data: Access how much time the authorizing user spent in different productivity levels\n\nalert_data: Access the authorizing user's alert history\n\nhighlight_data: Read from and post to the authorizing user's daily highlights list\n\nfocustime_data: Access the authorizing user's Focus Session history and session starting and stopping\n\nAPI Endpoints\n\nThere are several API endpoints that can be used to access different types of data within RescueTime.\n\nAnalytic Data API:\n\nThe Analytic Data API is targeted at bringing developers the prepared and pre-organized data structures already familiar through the reporting views of www.rescuetime.com.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Analytic Data API\n\nDaily Summary Feed API:\n\nThe Daily Summary Feed API provides a structured rollup of daily data about the time logged by a user. This data includes: total time logged, time logged at each productivity level, average productivity pulse, and the time spent in each major category.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Daily Summary Feed API\n\nAlerts Feed API:\n\nThe Alerts Feed API provides a feed of recent occurrences of user-defined alerts. It is a good way to let users define aspects of their data that they care about (“I want to spend more than 5 hours per day on All Productive Time”, for example) and then use that data in an external service.\n\nNote: Alerts are a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return empty results for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Alerts Feed API\n\nHighlights Feed API:\n\nThe Highlights Feed API provides a feed of recently entered daily highlights.\n\nNote: Highlights are a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return empty results for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Highlights Feed API\n\nHighlights POST API:\n\nThe Highlights POST API allows users to post a daily highlight entry programatically. An example use case is posting a new highlight whenever a software developer makes a new check-in to their GIT repository.\n\nNote: Highlights are a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return a 400 response for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Highlights Post API\n\nFocus Session Trigger API:\n\nThe Focus Session Trigger API allows users to start Focus Session on their active devices programatically.\n\nNote: Focus Session is a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return a 400 response for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Focus Session Trigger API\n\nFocus Session Feed API:\n\nThe Focus Session Feed API provides a feed of recent Focus Session \"started\" or Focus Session \"ended\" events. An example use case would be to set a chat application status to \"away\" when a new Focus Session started event has been detected.\n\nNote: Focus Sessions are a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return a 400 response for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Focus Session Feed API\n\nOffline Time POST API:\n\nThe Offline Time POST API allows users to post offline time to their account programmatically. An example use case would be to post offline time based on localtion data or meeting times.\n\nNote: Offline Time is a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return a 400 response for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Offline Time Post API\n\nDocumentation for the Analytic Data API\n\nRescueTime data is detailed and complicated. The Analytic Data API is targeted at bringing developers the prepared and pre-organized data structures already familiar through the reporting views of www.rescuetime.com. The data is read-only through the webservice, but you can perform any manipulations on the consumer side you want. Keep in mind this is a draft interface, and may change in the future. We do intend to version the interfaces though, so it is likely forward compatible.\n\nThe Analytic Data API allows for parameterized access, which means you can change the subject and scope of data, and is especially targeted for developer use. The data can be accessed via the HTTP Query interface in several formats.\n\nThe Analytic Data API is presented as a read-only resource accessed by simple GET HTTP queries. This provides maximum flexibility with minimal complexity; you can use the provided API tools, or just research the documented parameters and construct your own queries.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach this HTTP query API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key: https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/data\n\nFor Oauth2 connections:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/data - This is the least restritive url and requires the time_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRestricted Report: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/overview_data - This url will restricts the output to top level category data only and requires the category_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRestricted Report: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/category_data - This url will restricts the output to sub-category data only and requires the category_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRestricted Report: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/productivity_data - This url will restricts the output to productivity data only and requires the productivity_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nAbout restricted reports: Restricted reports may be useful if your application requires a less-granular rollup of the data, such as the category view, but NOT the actual activities themselves. These restricted reports help ensure the user’s privacy, and may be a preferable option when asking them to link their accounts.\n\nRequired parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nformat - [ 'csv' | 'json' ]\n\nQuery Parameters\n\nPrimary names are chosen for human reading. The short names are for when GET query length is at a premium. The alias is for understanding roughly how it maps into the language used in reporting views, and our own internal nicknames.\n\nPrinciple name Short Alias Short Values Description perspectivepvbyby [ 'rank' | 'interval' ]\n\nConsider this the X - axis of the returned data. It is what determines how your data is crunched serverside for ordered return.\n\nrank: (default) Organized around a calculated value, usually a sum like time spent.\n\ninterval: Organized around calendar time.\n\nresolution_timersintervali [ 'month' | 'week' | 'day' | 'hour' | 'minute' ]\n\nDefault is \"hour\". In an interval report, the X axis unit. In other words, data is summarizd into chunks of this size. \"minute\" will return data grouped into five-minute buckets, which is the most granular view available.\n\nrestrict_beginrb date\n\nSets the start day for data batch, inclusive (always at time 00:00, start hour/minute not supported)\n\nFormat ISO 8601 \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n\nrestrict_endre date\n\nSets the end day for data batch, inclusive (always at time 00:00, end hour/minute not supported)\n\nFormat ISO 8601 \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n\nrestrict_kindrktaxonomyty [ 'category' | 'activity' | 'productivity' | 'document' ]\n\n('efficiency' is option when perspective is 'interval')\n\nAllows you to preprocess data through different statistical engines. The perspective dictates the main grouping of the data, this provides different aspects of that main grouping.\n\noverview: sums statistics for all activities into their top level category\n\ncategory: sums statistics for all activities into their sub category\n\nactivity: sums statistics for individual applications / web sites / activities\n\nproductivity: productivity calculation\n\nefficiency: efficiency calculation (not applicable in \"rank\" perspective)\n\ndocument: sums statistics for individual documents and web pages\n\nrestrict_thingrttaxontx name (of category, activity, or overview)\n\nThe name of a specific overview, category, application or website. For websites, use the domain component only if it starts with \"www\", eg. \"www.nytimes.com\" would be \"nytimes.com\". The easiest way to see what name you should be using is to retrieve a list that contains the name you want, and inspect it for the exact names.\n\nrestrict_thingyrysub_taxontn name\n\nRefers to the specific \"document\" or \"activity\" we record for the currently active application, if supported. For example, the document name active when using Microsoft Word. Available for most major applications and web sites. Let us know if yours is not.\n\nrestrict_source_type [ 'computers' | 'mobile' | 'offline' ]\n\nAllows for querying by source device type.\n\nrestrict_schedule_id rsi schedule_id s id (integer id of user's schedule/time filter)\n\nAllows for filtering results by schedule.\n\nOutput Formats\n\nThe Analytic Data API supports CSV and JSON output.\n\ncsv - layout provides rows of comma separated data with a header for column names at top.\n\njson - returns a JavaScript ready object. It has these properties:\n\nnotes = String, a short explanation of the data envelope\n\nrow_headers = Array, a label for the contents of each index in a row, in the order they appear in row\n\nrows = Array X Array, an array of data rows, where each row is itself an array described by the row_headers\n\nExample Queries\n\nTo request information about the user's productivity levels, by hour, for the date of January 1, 2020:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/data?key=YOUR_API_KEY&perspective=interval&restrict_kind=productivity&interval=hour&restrict_begin=2020-01-01&restrict_end=2020-01-01&format=json\n\nTo request a list of time spent in each top level category, ranked by duration, for the date of January 1, 2020:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/data?key=YOUR_API_KEY&perspective=rank&restrict_kind=overview&restrict_begin=2020-01-01&restrict_end=2020-01-01&format=csv\n\nDocumentation for the Daily Summary Feed API\n\nThe Daily Summary Feed API provides a high level rollup of the the time a user has logged for a full 24 hour period (defined by the user’s selected time zone). This is useful for generating notifications that don’t need to be real-time and don’t require much granularity (for greater precision or more timely alerts, see the Alerts Feed API). This can be used to construct a customized daily progress report delivered via email. The summary can also be used to alert people to specific conditions. For example, if a user has more than 20% of their time labeled as ‘uncategorized’, that can be used to offer people a message to update their categorizations on the website.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The Daily Summary Feed is ‘point in time‘ data - use the data api or export CSVs from reports if you want your latest categorization results.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach this Daily Summary Feed API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key: https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/daily_summary_feed\n\nFor Oauth2 connections: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/daily_summary_feed\n\nRequired parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nOutput Format\n\nThe Daily Summary Feed API returns an array of JSON objects representing rollup information for each day logged by the user in the previous two weeks. It does not include the current day, and new summaries for the previous day are available at 12:01 am in the user’s local time zone. The returned value for each daily summary includes the following information:\n\nGeneral information\n\nid - Unix Timestamp representation of the date. Can use useful for deduplication of items in the feed.\n\ndate - Summary Date\n\nproductivity_pulse - Overall productivity pulse. A scale bewteen 0-100\n\nPercentage representation of time spent in different categories (Float with one decimal place.

This is a good event-based representation of data that the user cares about. Alerts are a premium feature and as such the API will always return zero results for users on the RescueTime Lite plan.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach the Alerts Feed API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key: https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/alerts_feed\n\nFor Oauth2 connections: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/alerts_feed - Requires the alert_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRequired parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nop - [ status | list ]\n\nThe op parameter determines what type of information about the alerts is returned. Passing op=list will return a definition list of all the alerts currently defined by the user. This is useful for presenting a list of the user's alerts to allow the user to select an alert_id value that will be used to filter subsequent queries.\n\nPassing op a value of status is the default, and will return a list of recently triggered alerts in reverse-chronological order.\n\nOptional parameters\n\nalert_id - [ Integer ID of an alert to filter on ]\n\nOutput Format\n\nWhen passing op=list, The Alerts Feed API will return an array of JSON objects representing the currently active alerts that the user has defined. Each alert object has the following structure:\n\n{\n\n'id': integer (Unique id of the user-defined alert, can be used for filtering the triggered alerts),\n\n'description': string (The string representation of the alert definition),\n\n'amount': float (the number of hours the user has defined for this alert’s threshold)\n\n}\n\nWhen passing op=status, the feed returns an array of JSON objects representing the actual triggering of alerts in reverse chronological order. Each object has the following structure:\n\n{\n\n'id': integer (Unique id for the occurence of the alert triggering),\n\n'alert_id': integer (Unique id of the user-defined alert, can be used to filter alerts),\n\n'description': string (The message generated by the triggered alert),\n\n'created_at': datetime (The time, in user’s selected time zone, that the alert was triggered)\n\n}\n\nExample Queries\n\nTo request a list of for the user's active alerts:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/alerts_feed?key=YOUR_API_KEY&op=list\n\nTo request a list of alert 12345 being triggered for the user:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/alerts_feed?key=YOUR_API_KEY&op=status&alert_id=12345\n\nDocumentation for the Highlights Feed API\n\nThe Highlights Feed API is a list of recently entered Daily Highlight events. These are user-entered strings that are meant to provide qualitative context for the automatically logged time about the user’s activities. It is often used to keep a log of “what got done today”. Highlights are a premium feature and as such the API will always return zero results for users on the RescueTime Lite plan.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach the Highlights Feed API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key: https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/highlights_feed\n\nFor Oauth2 connections: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/highlights_feed - Requires the highlight_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRequired parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nOutput Format\n\nThe Highlights Feed API returns an array of JSON objects representing the highlights that have been entered by a user. The returned value for each highlight has the following structure:\n\n{\n\n'id': integer (Unique id to trigger off of, useful for polling for new items),\n\n'description': string (The text of the highlight),\n\n'date': date (Date that the highlight was entered for, may be different than created_at),\n\n'created_at': datetime (Timestamp when the highlight was entered)\n\n}\n\nExample Queries\n\nTo request a list of for the user's recently entered daily highlights:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/highlights_feed?key=YOUR_API_KEY\n\nDocumentation for the FocusTime Feed API\n\nThe FocusTime Feed API is a running log of recently triggered started/ended FocusTime sessions. This is useful for performing 3rd party app interactions whenever a new FocusTime session has started/ended. FocusTime is a premium feature and as such the API will always return zero results for users on the RescueTime Lite plan.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach the FocusTime Feed API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/focustime_started_feed\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/focustime_ended_feed\n\nFor Oauth2 connections:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/focustime_started_feed\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/focustime_ended_feed\n\n- Requires the focustime_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRequired parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nOutput Format\n\nThe FocusTime Feed API returns an array of JSON objects representing the FocusTime started/ended events in reverse chronological order. Each object has the following structure:\n\n{\n\n'id': float (A UNIX timestamp that represents a unique id for the event),\n\n'duration': integer (The initial length of time in minutes for the FocusTime Session, focustime_started_feed only),\n\n'created_at': datetime (The time, in user’s selected time zone, that the session was started)\n\n}\n\nExample Queries\n\nTo request a list of recent FocusTime started Events:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/focustime_started_feed?key=YOUR_API_KEY\n\nDocumentation for the Offline Time POST API\n\nThe Offline Time Post API makes it possible to post offline time programmatically as an alternative to entering it manually on RescueTime.com. This is useful for capturing information from other systems. Examples include adding offline time after a meeting on a calendar app, or logging driving time based on location data.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach Offline Time POST API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key: https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/offline_time_post\n\nFor Oauth2 connections: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/offline_time_post - Requires the time_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nNote: A POST request must be used for this API. Also, offline time posts via the API are limited to a 4 hour maximum duration, and they can not be created for future dates.\n\nRequired QUERY parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nRequired JSON keys/values\n\nstart_time - A string representing the date/time the for the start of the offline time block. This should be in the format of ‘YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS’, but a unix timestamp is also acceptable.\n\nend_time/duration - Either a string representing the date/time the for the end of the offline time block, OR an integer representing the duration of the offline time block in minutes.\n\nactivity_name - A 255 character or shorter string containing the text that will be entered as the name of the activity (e.g. \"Meeting\", \"Driving\", \"Sleeping\", etc).\n\nOptional JSON keys/values\n\nactivity_details - A 255 character or shorter string containing the text that will be entered as the details of the named activity.\n\nOutput Format\n\nA successful post will return at status code of 200. If there is an error, a status code of 400 will be returned.\n\nExample Requests\n\nTo post offline time about a meeting that just ended:\n\nA POST request to the following URL:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/offline_time_post?key=YOUR_API_KEY\n\nwith a JSON body of:\n\n{\n\n\"start_time\": \"2020-01-01 09:00:00\",\n\n\"duration\": 60,\n\n\"activity_name\": \"Meeting\",\n\n\"activity_details\": \"Daily Planning\"\n\n}\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\nWhen you enable access to your data, you generate a key that is saved in RescueTime's system. Essentially, this key provides an alternative read-only authentication to your data. You can keep this key private, in which case it's just as safe as your login and password, or publish it, without exposing your account to other access or risks beyond the scope of the data.\n\nWe assume data api access is being requested for use on the server side of things, presumably in some code of your own. In this case, you can protect the key as you would any other server side secret. It would never be seen in the browser, but used by your application to retrieve data from us then process and render yourself somehow. So in this case, the key provides read-only access to your data by arbitrary scope (within limits) through parameters.\n\nAs a user, you can revoke access to keys you have created by going to your Key Management Page. Any applications you have connected to via an Oauth2 connection, can be revoked by going to your connected applications page.",
      "# [RescueTime](https://community.rescuetime.com/)\nCommunity Discussion\n\nThis category is for general discussion among RescueTime community members.\n\n27\n\nBalance\n\nThere’s more to life than just work! This category has topics that help bring balance during your day.\n\n4",
      "# [RescueTime](https://community.rescuetime.com/faq)\nThis is a Civilized Place for Public Discussion\n\nPlease treat this discussion forum with the same respect you would a public park. We, too, are a shared community resource — a place to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing conversation.\n\nThese are not hard and fast rules. They are guidelines to aid the human judgment of our community and keep this a kind, friendly place for civilized public discourse.\n\nImprove the Discussion\n\nHelp us make this a great place for discussion by always adding something positive to the discussion, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.\n\nOne way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening. Spend time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you’ll have a better chance of meeting others who share your interests.\n\nThe topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.\n\nBe Agreeable, Even When You Disagree\n\nYou may wish to respond by disagreeing. That’s fine. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Please avoid:\n\nName-calling\n\nAd hominem attacks\n\nResponding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content\n\nKnee-jerk contradiction\n\nInstead, provide thoughtful insights that improve the conversation.\n\nYour Participation Counts\n\nThe conversations we have here set the tone for every new arrival. Help us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an interesting place to be — and avoiding those that do not.\n\nDiscourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, watching, muting and so forth. Use these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else’s, too.\n\nLet’s leave our community better than we found it.\n\nIf You See a Problem, Flag It\n\nModerators have special authority; they are responsible for this forum. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.\n\nWhen you see bad behavior, don’t reply. Replying encourages bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. Just flag it. If enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.\n\nIn order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts; the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.\n\nAlways Be Civil\n\nNothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:\n\nBe civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.\n\nKeep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.\n\nRespect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.\n\nRespect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.\n\nThese are not concrete terms with precise definitions — avoid even the appearance of any of these things. If you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of a major news site.\n\nThis is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.\n\nKeep It Tidy\n\nMake the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up. So:\n\nDon’t start a topic in the wrong category; please read the category definitions.\n\nDon’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.\n\nDon’t post no-content replies.\n\nDon’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.\n\nDon’t sign your posts — every post has your profile information attached to it.\n\nRather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button. Rather than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction, use Reply as a Linked Topic.\n\nPost Only Your Own Stuff\n\nYou may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission. You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone’s intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.\n\nPowered by You\n\nThis site is operated by your friendly local staff and you, the community. If you have any further questions about how things should work here, open a new topic in the site feedback category and let’s discuss! If there’s a critical or urgent issue that can’t be handled by a meta topic or flag, contact us via the staff page.\n\nTerms of Service",

Users download a desktop application from RescueTime that does all the tracking work.\r\nThere is no data entry needed from the user's perspective.  The application keeps track of which window is \"in focus\" when you are on your computer, and logs what activity you are doing and for how long you are doing it.  The application also has an idle timer so if you step away from your computer RescueTime does not inflate the amount of time you spent on a given activity.\n\n- [Website](http://rescuetime.com)\n- [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/company/rescuetime)\n- [Twitter](http://twitter.com/rescuetime)\n\n## Funding (0M USD total)\n\n- 0M USD on 2008-09-23\n- 0M USD on 2007-10-14\n\n## News\n\n- Meta's Latest Game-changer: Whatsapp Flows and the Future of Conversational Shopping Experiences ([markets.businessinsider.com, 2024-03-04](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/meta-s-latest-game-changer-whatsapp-flows-and-the-future-of-conversational-shopping-experiences-1033077938))\n- 4 digital payment trends to look out for in 2021 ([Lorena Torres, 2021-01-25](https://latamlist.com/?p=8622))\n- How MoEngage, powered by AWS, is processing 1 trillion data points monthly to drive insight-led customer engagement ([Team YS, 2020-11-14](https://yourstory.com/2020/11/moengage-powered-aws-trillion-data-points-drive-customer-engagement))\n- The Best Free Google Chrome Extensions ([Eric Griffith, 2020-07-16](https://trib.al/7Z70yOL))\n- Remote work and the screen-time debate ([Megan Jenkins, 2020-05-28](https://medium.com/cgo-benchmark/remote-work-and-the-screen-time-debate-de620d4a48ad))\n- Paint Your Roam with Custom CSS ([maggieappleton.com, 2020-05-23](http://maggieappleton.com/paintingroam))\n- 6 Tools You Can Use to Improve Time Management Skills ([IntelligentHQ, 2020-05-22](https://bit.ly/2WWwaB7))\n- What I learned when I experimented with turning on notifications for a month ([Daniel Rose—RescueTime, 2019-11-08](https://www.fastcompany.com/90428031/what-one-writer-learned-when-he-turned-on-all-notifications))\n- RescueTime ([ZD Net, 2019-05-26](https://downloads.zdnet.com/product/20418-78073285/))\n- You can be much more productive.

It would have saved me some time frustration if the app description had just said that, or at least said it when I opened the app. Unless something has changed? I’d love to actually use this app. I used it probably 10 years ago, and loved it. I even paid for it for quite a while. Now I’m trying to reduce my streaming time, so I was wanting to use the basic features again.\nI do all my streaming on my iPad, so if RescueTime can’t track app usage here, then this won’t work for me.\n\nBefore I read that this won’t work on my iPad, when I installed this app and created a new account with my new email and signed in, it only let me choose between the 2 paid versions. There was no way to select the free version.\n\nSo that’s not a great user interface on both counts. This has all just been a waste of time.",

I worry that the company may be in a downward spiral.\n\nPerhaps I'm just paranoid or it's just my design-inclined brain, but there's just little signs that make me wonder if they're trying to cut costs and at the same time improve revenue where they can. They've merged old RT in with the new and called it \"time analytics\", but didn't do anything to improve the old stuff or even simply make it look like the new UI--same with the old goals and alerts which was a huge headache for me since all of my old alerts started popping up even though they were no longer relevant.\n\nLikewise, the new design of the blog feels half-baked. Some of the new layout is kind of reflective of new design trends, but most of it feels quite antiquated and there's quite a few places with a lack of padding so that elements feel lacking in polish. There have also clearly been some articles being republished, or at least they're putting a spotlight on old ones in the emails.\n\nAnyway, I don't have any conclusive evidence.

To (hopefully) ease your concerns, I am going to paste a (slightly modified) reply I sent to a recent question on our community page.  As you will see, there's a reason for some of the UX inconsistencies, but we are working to unify those into a much more modern experience.  \n\nRe: the \"cut costs / improve revenue where they can\" - unlike most SaaS companies, our pricing has remained unchanged (not to mention we added a major new feature - Timesheets - and included it in the existing plan for no additional cost). Any more on why you are feeling that way? \n\nThanks for being a part of the community - if you have any suggestions or features you think would be valuable, drop them here or on our community page.

Timesheets was a major release for us and we have heard a lot of positive feedback about how much it helps solve a truly miserable problem - having to track project time.    \n\n**Unifying the RescueTime Experience**  \nAs we discussed before, in 2021, we released a new version of RescueTime to simplify the user experience. While there were many positive changes, especially on the technical/design side, we heard from users that some key features of the traditional experience were missing, like advanced reporting and data trends. In 2024, we started to combine the best aspects of the traditional RescueTime with the modern version (desktop assistant, universal Focus Sessions, modern web experience). So far, in 2024 we have:\n\n- Opened up the traditional Time Analytics dashboard and reports for newer RescueTime users (accessible via the mode menu next to the logo)\n\n- Built a new Goals and Alerts interface, including the addition of Timesheet project goals\n\n- Updated the Windows desktop assistant for better handling of closing and minimizing\n\n- Fixed the desktop assistant issues related to unnecessary sounds\n\n- Improved the cross-device Focus Session experience, so starting a Focus Session on desktop will block apps on iOS\n\n- Updated our logo \n\nAnd coming soon…\n\n- Modernizing the design and UX of the traditional RescueTime elements (note, we are planning to release these as we finish them, so things may look a little inconsistent from a UX perspective until the work is complete).  \n\n- Streamlining the Focus Session start process into a single screen in the desktop assistant\n\n\n\nOur team remains super motivated and working hard every day to enhance your experience. We’re committed to helping our community stay protected from the constant distractions and focus on the work that matters.\n\nExpect a more formal update with these details and future roadmap plans to hit your inbox soon.\n\n### Comment ID lugoahw with +1 score by [(FiveDigitLP, Reddit, 2024-10-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RescueTime/comments/1g5vqmz/rescuetime_are_you_okay/lugoahw/) (in reply to ID lss78t1):\nThanks for your thorough response, JP!\n\nI did not consider that RescueTime’s pricing has remained the same for so long. You definitely bring up a valid point and I recognize how rare that is! As a user for several years, thank you for that!\n\nI agree that the features you mentioned in your original post are important. As my employer has been asking us to keep track of our project time more, I have found Timesheets to definitely be invaluable for me when I forget to start a timer!\n\nPersonally, the “newer” assistant still feels rough around the edges. Maybe I need to check for an update, though, because I still feel like I have some weird issues with closing and minimizing. Also, sometimes it feels like the alerts can be delayed. I will be doing distracting activities, but sometimes by the time the alert pops up I’ve already moved onto something else. I don’t know what can be done about this since I know that there is going to be some inherent delay if the assistant has to communicate back and forth with the server; likewise, I’m wondering if this issue might be exacerbated when I’m doing distracting activities on my phone.\n\nBack to the cost cutting point, at the time when I wrote this there were several aspects of the blog that when combined gave me the impression that there was a lack of care and polish with that facet of the company. In particular, there was a guest post that appeared to be republished. I don’t have an inherent problem with this, but most, if not all, of the links in the post no longer worked. I’d say this was the catalyst for me writing this post on Reddit. I have been frustrated with little things here and there with RT for a little while now, but trying to read a post and not being able to actually take action on the information it was providing brought everything to a head for me, I suppose.\n\nAnyway, thank you again for taking the time to respond. I did not expect anyone from RescueTime to actually reply.

So at the end of the day (or later) you can go back and define which part of the day goes to project A or B…\n\nThen you can setup auto tracking rules based on : file opened, file in folder opened, window title, website opened….\n\nIt’s really awesome !\n\n## Comment ID iztla0n with +3 score by [(nielsmouthaan, Reddit, 2022-12-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/zj3i1k/whats_the_best_time_tracking_app_for_mac_that/iztla0n/) (in reply to ID zj3i1k):\n[Daily](https://dailytimetracking.com) offers an alternative to automatic time tracking (which can be a bit privacy-invasive as you'll need to permit it to monitor whatever you do on your Mac). It periodically asks what you're doing, removing the need to toggle timers whenever you switch tasks (which likely is why you're looking for an automatic tracker).

It'll automatically track your time on different apps/sites so you can just set and forget.

The good news is that you don’t need the Chrome extension for RescueTime to work properly.\n\nIf you’ve installed the Windows or Mac desktop app, your time spent on websites in Chrome will still be tracked. The only users significantly affected by this change are Chromebook users, which represent a very small portion of our user base.\n\nWe’ll revisit our approach to the Chrome extension down the road, but for now, since it’s not critical to RescueTime’s functionality, we’re holding off on significant development until the situation stabilizes.\n\nThanks for your understanding!\n\nBest,\n\nJP",
      "# [Team Reports on 2024-06-20](https://help.rescuetime.com/article/35-team-reports)\nIn addition to the individual Premium reports accessible by each member of your team, RescueTime for Teams provides special team reports. The group reports in RescueTime for Teams will help your team members visualize their cumulative time and understand how they are working together as a group. These reports include rollup statistics about how time was spent in different categories at different times of the day or week. If Key Tools are configured, your team can also see how much time they spend using specific tools.\n\nGroup reports are accessible by everyone on the team\n\nThe reports are a tool for the entire group to see how they are working as a team. As such, they are available to all members. It lets individuals see benchmarks of team norms, and helps them understand their place in the group.\n\nTime-tracking systems within an organization often raise questions by those being tracked. Team members may worry about being \"spied on\". The best ways to address any concerns is to show potential team members what data is available in the reports and to remind them that RescueTime is not designed to be employee monitoring software. It is both a tool to help managers make smart choices about the overall team time-management strategy and a source of valuable information for the individuals on the team.\n\nIndividual data is not accessible in the group reports\n\nThe group reports only contain anonymized, aggregated information about how the team as a whole is spending its time. A manager cannot view an individual's private details or activities. Group time is aggregated, and in most cases rolled up to the category level. Key Tools are the only activities that will be displayed explicitly in team reports. This helps ensure the privacy of your team members and cuts down on a lot of noise that would make your reports less oriented toward the goal of increasing productivity as a team.\n\nAccessing Team Settings\n\nTeam settings are found in the drop down menu under the Tools icon:\n\nAccessing the group reports\n\nYou can access the group reports by clicking Reports in the top navigation, and choose Your Team:\n\nSummary Report\n\nThe summary report gives a high-level overview of how your team is spending its time. You will be able to see the total time logged for the team, the time by day, top categories and key tools, and a breakdown of patterns throughout the day. You can adjust the date and time frame using the date controls at the top of the page. You can also view time by day, week, month, or year.\n\nCategories Report\n\nThe categories report shows a detailed analysis of how time is spent across different categories. For the selected period you can see the total time in each category as well as a breakdown of how that time was spent during particular hours, days or weeks.\n\nKey Tools Report\n\nThe Key Tools report shows a detailed breakdown of how time is spent in the different key tools you have configured. For the selected period, you can see the total time in each key tool as well as a breakdown of how that time was spent across hours, days, or weeks. You can configure your key tools on the Tracking Settings page: https://www.rescuetime.com/sponsors/tracking_settings\n\nPlease note: As owner or administrator, you would set up the categories for the Key Tool activities for your team. However, your team member can change this category in their own reports. This will not alter the team reports. Suppose your team member decides to change a category in their own reports. In that case, this time will still be accounted for and applied to the category you originally set for the Key Tool activity and therefore be included in the team reports.\n\nDid this answer your question?

      "# [11 Best RescueTime Alternatives for Creative Agencies in 2025](https://www.manyrequests.com/blog/rescuetime-alternatives)\nIf you're looking for RescueTime's alternatives which offer both team collaboration and workflow tracking, you're in the right place.\n\nAnd if you're tired of juggling multiple tools (for different tasks) and now want tools tailored to creative workflows, rejoice.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause in this article, I'll give you exactly that. Eleven in all.\n\nSince you're searching for RescueTime's alternatives, I believe you already know its limitations.\n\nSo let's not waste our time going over what you already know too well.\n\nInstead, let's jump straight to the thick of the action.\n\nDeal? Let's go.\n\n11 Best RescueTime Alternatives\n\nHere are 11 best RescueTime alternatives.\n\nManyRequests\n\n🔥 An all-in-one solution for agencies.\n\nManyRequests exists solely to serve creative agencies. It was built specifically for them. A platform so specific in its purpose and positioning, it's got everything you need to scale your creative agency.\n\nSo what makes ManyRequests tick? Let's consider just a few of its features.\n\nManyRequests Core Features\n\nTask Collaboration\n\nManyRequests' task collaboration feature enhances teamwork and streamlines communication for both teams and clients.\n\nWhether it's just team members or a client working alongside them, ManyRequests makes collaboration easy and efficient.\n\nAs an agency owner or a project manager, you can create tasks with deadlines, add priority levels and assign them to specific team members. Clients can be given access to those tasks so they can track progress.\n\nManyRequests makes it possible to leave comments and feedback on tasks. Team members can provide updates and ask questions within the task’s comment section.\n\nClients can also comment on tasks, and give feedback or request revisions. With everything happening in real-time inside ManyRequests, there's absolutely no need to communicate via a slow, time-consuming email.\n\nThis shortens feedback loops and ensures everyone is on the same page.Notifications are sent out whenever a team member makes a comment or changes the status of a task.\n\nYou can set up dependencies between tasks, making the execution of a task dependent on the completion of another.\n\nManyRequests supports automated workflows which run on pre-defined triggers, where the completion of a task triggers the next and notifies the team member to whom that particular task was assigned.\n\nIts time-tracking ability allows team members to log hours worked directly on tasks while you (an agency owner or project manager) monitor how time is spent on tasks. Your team doesn't need any other tool for this.\n\nTeam members are able to upload and share files directly within tasks. This means everyone can access the latest file versions.\n\nThey can also track versions of documents and files, making sure only the latest versions are available for use.\n\nClients on their part can see whether their project is progressing according to their expectations and leave feedback. This builds trust between clients and the team.\n\nIf a client isn't satisfied with a project, they can reject it within the platform.\n\nIn ManyRequests, each task can be assigned a deadline and a priority level. This ensures that the most important and urgent tasks get completed first.\n\nAnd as a deadline approaches, notifications are sent out as reminders.\n\nIt's also possible to assign a single task to multiple team members in ManyRequests. This is ideal for projects or tasks which require cross-functional collaboration involving multiple creative teams or departments.\n\nProjects such as these would normally require collaborative editing where team members work on the same file at the same time.\n\nManyRequests integrates smoothly with a wide range of popular design tools.\n\nThis further optimizes and supercharges the workflow for creative agencies, designers, and teams working on visual projects.\n\nPairing ManyRequests with Figma, Adobe Creative Cloud, Sketch, Canva, and other design platforms, creative agencies get to work more collaboratively, seamlessly and efficiently, saving time and beating deadlines.\n\nUsing webhooks in Zapier, you can integrate ManyRequests with countless tools and automate many aspects of your workflows.\n\nBranded Client Portals\n\nManyRequests provides a customizable and professional solution through its branded client portals.\n\nManyRequests client portal is a powerful tool for managing client relationships and improving project workflows. The good news is that it's customizable. Yes, you can don it in your brand's full regalia — logo, colors, fonts, banners, etc.\n\nA branded portal offers clients a personalized and professional experience while they monitor their projects, communicate directly with teams and provide feedback all in one place.\n\nThe client portal effectively becomes an extension of your creative agency. It helps to reinforce what your brand represents in the mind of your clients.\n\nYou can also create your own custom URL taking personalization even further. That way, clients get to access that portal through a web address which already resonates with them.\n\nWhile in your branded portal, clients can access information about their projects in real time — task progress, timelines, budgets, invoices, milestones and deadlines all in one place. How convenient?\n\nClients can do quite a lot while they're there — drop comments, ask questions, leave feedback on tasks and receive notifications all in real time.\n\nThis level of transparency and communication can only do one thing — build trust with your clients.\n\nApart from comments on tasks, there's a message center within ManyRequests where clients and teams can communicate even more broadly. Who needs disruptive email at this point? None.\n\nOnce projects are completed, clients can approve them, formally signing off on them inside the portal.\n\nWhile at it, they also get the low-down on financial matters — how much was budgeted, what was spent and how. They can then proceed to view invoices, make payments, and track their payment history directly within the portal.\n\nIf you're big on reports and analysis, you'll have a field day generating and sharing them with clients through the portal.\n\nFeedback Loops\n\nManyRequests offers a streamlined process for creating effective feedback loops.\n\nFeedback is an important aspect of project management. It's how you get to know the mind of the client as the project progresses — their expectations and goals.\n\nManyRequests doesn't drop the ball in this regard.\n\nHow?\n\nIt has feedback built into your workflow.

Let's look at its core features.\n\nHubstaff Core Features\n\nTime Tracking and Productivity Monitoring\n\nHubstaff’s time Tracking and productivity monitoring feature helps agency owners to streamline workflow and ensure accountability.\n\nAlthough time tracking happens automatically in Hubstaff, team members can manually start and stop timers for specific tasks.\n\nThis gives them more control.\n\nWhat exactly does this feature monitor? Keyboard and mouse usage to track activity levels.\n\nAnd if a team member stops working on a task, the timer can pause tracking and send out a reminder. This makes the task completion process transparent and accurate.\n\nDuring monitoring, this tool can take screenshots at random as visual proof of work.\n\nSome team members may find this overly intrusive.\n\nProductivity reports are generated from these time logs showing time spent on specific tasks and how team members allocate time to tasks.\n\nProject Management and Budgeting\n\nHubstaff's project management and budgeting tools make streamlining workflows, managing resources to stay within budget easy.\n\nAs a team lead or project manager, you can create and assign tasks to specific team members, and also set due dates.\n\nThey can then go ahead to complete these tasks, tracking time against them as they work. That way, they're able to provide time-based updates.\n\nIn Hubstaff, tasks are organized by priority, so team members can complete the most important ones first.\n\nHubstaff's budget feature ensures time and funds allocated to projects remain within limits.\n\nThis helps teams to not exceed time allocated to tasks. As a result, it notifies the team lead or project manager when the time allocated for specific projects is almost up.\n\nThis helps to maintain both time and financial discipline within teams.\n\nPayroll and Invoicing Automation\n\nHubstaff’s Payroll and Invoicing Automation feature integrates time-tracking data with payment and billing.\n\nThis makes it easy to pay team members accurately and on time.\n\nThis tool automatically calculates hours worked by team members, eliminating human error.\n\nMultiple payment methods are available — PayPal, Wise, Payoneer, and Bitwage. Payments can be scheduled — weekly, biweekly, or monthly.\n\nHubstaff Pros\n\nScreenshot capture\n\nHubstaff captures screenshots as part of employee monitoring to maintain accountability.\n\nProductivity reports\n\nHubstaff generates reports showing time spent on specific tasks.\n\nHubstaff Cons\n\nLack of in-depth reporting\n\nHubstaff analytics and reporting are pretty basic.\n\nHubstaff Pricing\n\nHubstaff offers 4 paid plans in addition to a free plan.\n\nFree ($0/month)\n\nStarter ($7/user/month)\n\nGrow ($9/user/month)\n\nTeam ($12/user/month)\n\nEnterprise ($25/user/month)\n\nHubstaff Use Case\n\nHubstaff is particularly useful for agencies that operate in remote or hybrid environments and therefore, need project budgeting, employee monitoring, and reporting.\n\nHubstaff will be well-suited for small to medium-sized agencies (5-200 team members) with remote or hybrid teams.\n\nHubstaff Review\n\nDiana P. says Hubstaff is great for small businesses and remote worker\n\nManicTime\n\nFor businesses which need accurate time data for billing and resource management.\n\n‍\n\nManicTime is a time-tracking software which provides detailed insights into work patterns.

This happens automatically with no manual input from the user.\n\nWorking in the background, it automatically logs every activity performed by each team member. It records time spent on various applications. This makes it essy for team members to see which tools they use most.\n\nIt also tracks documents, files or websites visited and calculates time spent on each. This can furnish agency owners and project managers with detailed insights into work sessions.\n\nManicTime is smart enough to differentiate between active and inactive periods.\n\nIt monitors mouse and keyboard activity and if no activity is detected for sometime, it ticks it off as idle time.\n\nThe time interval is customizable. Team members can set what amounts to idle time according to their workflow.\n\nOf course, team members don't work only on computers. ManicTime also tracks offline activity as well.\n\nFor example, if team members are in a meeting, on a phone call, or away on fieldwork, they can log this time manually.\n\nOffline time entries will show up along with automatically tracked time.\n\nProductivity Analysis\n\nManicTime's Productivity Analysis feature helps team members to understand how their time is spent. This enables them to identify inefficiencies and lapses in concentration.\n\nThey can study their work patterns to gain insights into how they can improve.\n\nManicTime groups users' activity in two depending on how related those activities are to work — productive and unproductive.\n\nThese reports are generated at intervals — daily, weekly, monthly.\n\nManicTime analyzes time spent on apps, websites and documents.\n\nFrom this tracked data, you can see the work habits and patterns of your team over time. You can then tweak things to boost productivity and keep distraction down.\n\nManicTime analyzes focus time, a stretch of time where team members work without getting distracted or switching between tasks.\n\nFrequent task switching and time spent on activities that aren't related to work are chalked off as unproductive.\n\nIt also tracks time at the task level, monitoring time spent on individual tasks. Using this data, workflows can be streamlined and made more efficient.\n\nIntegration and Export\n\nThis feature makes connecting with other tools and flexible sharing data easy. This means your creative agency can link tools you already use with ManicTime without having to tweak your workflows and systems.\n\nSo what third-party integrations are we talking about?\n\nProject management tools — Jira, Trello, and Asana.\n\nAccounting software — QuickBooks, Xero, or FreshBooks.\n\nCommunication platforms — Slack and Microsoft Teams.\n\nCustom integrations are also possible with the help of APIs.\n\nWhat about data export?\n\nManicTime supports flexible data export options, making it easy to share. You can share time-tracking information in various formats — CSV, Excel, and PDF.\n\nYou can generate timesheets for specific projects or tasks and send them to clients. You can also automate this process (if you will) so that data is exported at regular intervals.\n\nUse exported data to create custom reports to gain insights.\n\nManicTime Pros\n\nOffline capability\n\nManicTime works offline, making it ideal for users who may not have internet access or are away from their computers.\n\nDetailed reporting\n\nManicTime's analytics and customizable reports come in handy, allowing teams to understand their work patterns and optimize productivity effectively.\n\nManicTime Cons\n\nLimited Collaboration Features\n\nManicTime lacks several collaborative features that creative agencies need.\n\nManicTime Pricing\n\nManicTime offers two paid plans which take effect after a free trial ends.\n\nStandard plan: $9 per user per month ($7 dollars billed yearly)\n\nUltimate plan: $11 per user per month ($9 dollars billed yearly).\n\nManicTime Use Case\n\nManicTime is an excellent tool for agencies that need accurate time data for billing, performance evaluation, and resource management.\n\nIt's best suited for small to medium-sized agencies (5-100 members) that need a simple but potent tool for time tracking and productivity management.\n\nManicTime Review\n\nJoseph D. calls ManicTime a really great real-time monitoring software.\n\nDeskTime\n\nFor agencies with remote or hybrid teams.\n\n‍DeskTime is great at time-tracking and productivity management.

And if it doesn't detect any activity for a set period, it flags the time as idle.\n\nIt documents idle periods so agency owners and project managers can address inefficiencies and improve productivity.\n\nIn cases where team members are away from a computer (in the field or in a meeting), they can log offline time. This way, all work-related activities are accounted for.\n\nProject Management and Cost Tracking\n\nWith this feature, you can manage tasks, allocate and monitor project budgets and resources.\n\nAssign and track the time spent on individual tasks within projects.

It functions as a time tracker and timesheet tool with a dose of structure, insight, and helpful but pesky reminders to keep you on track. 🏃\n\nLike any productivity tool, RescueTime has its pros and cons. If you aren’t sure whether it’s worth your time (see what we did there?), check out this RescueTime app review. We’ll explain how RescueTime works, its pros, cons, and pricing. Plus, we’ll share a great alternative to RescueTime if you decide it’s not your thing. Let’s get to it!\n\nWhat Is RescueTime?\n\nRescueTime is a time-tracking tool designed to help you master time management. Sure, it tracks your time, but this all-in-one productivity tool does more than that. It provides comprehensive insights into how you spend your time.\n\nWhether you’re a freelancer who needs to create accurate timesheets or a team leader who needs to boost productivity levels, RescueTime offers the insights you need to set and meet goals. 🏅\n\nThe tool runs quietly in the background on your computer or mobile device, whether it’s Windows, Mac, iOS, or Android, gathering data on your activity. It then compiles this data into detailed reports and graphs showcasing your most productive times, distracting websites, and how you distributed work hours between tasks.\n\nRescueTime is different than other productivity and time-tracking tools because it gives you a productivity score (which it calls the productivity pulse). This score measures how efficiently you use your time. You can also set goals for your focus time and block distractions to stay in the zone.\n\nKey RescueTime Features\n\nThere’s a lot to love about RescueTime. Compared to competitors like Toggl and Clockify, it offers a more robust way to track your time and improve time management. Optimize your work hours and say bye-bye to distractions with RescueTime’s time-saving features.\n\n1. Focus Sessions\n\nRescueTime’s main feature is Focus Session, a Pomodoro-like work sesh where you set aside a block of time for focused work. The goal is to get into a mental flow state by mono-tasking, which is the key to real productivity. 🧠\n\nWe like that RescueTime doesn’t just throw you into a Focus Session. Their setup wizard takes you through a helpful prep session that includes a body check-in, reminding you to go to the bathroom or grab water. RescueTime also asks you to go through a quick mental reset, take a deep breath, and commit to your Focus Session before you click the “start” button.\n\nUsers say they like the prep checklist and the Focus Sessions themselves. You’re free to customize the session however you see fit. For example, RescueTime integrates with Spotify to personalize the experience without opening another app.\n\nAlso, every Focus Session tells you how many other workers are in Focus Sessions worldwide in real time. Body doubling, or feeling more motivated when someone works alongside you (in person or virtually), helps you get even more out of these Focus Sessions.\n\n2. RescueTime Assistant and AI (beta)\n\nAll RescueTime accounts come with an Assistant, which gives you a customized morning forecast of the day’s meetings and to-dos. Not only that, but the RescueTime Assistant also looks at your schedule and tells you the best time for focused work in between meetings and events. 🔎\n\nThis feature is still in beta, but RescueTime is also rolling out an AI-powered assistant. Currently available only for timesheets, the AI automatically divides time between projects and clients, improving the accuracy of your time-tracking. However, the AI needs a lot of data to do this for you, so set aside plenty of time to train the model.\n\n3. Distraction alerts and blocking\n\nHow often have you sat down intending to work, only to find yourself scrolling through Instagram? It happens to the best of us. 🙈\n\nSometimes, you need to take care of business, and in a world where distractions are just a tap away, you need to take more extreme measures.\n\nWhat sets RescueTime apart from other time-tracking apps is its ability to block distractions. Tell it which apps or websites are your Kryptonite, and it will block them during every Focus Session.\n\nIf you “forget” and try to access distracting websites anyway, you’ll get a pop-up from RescueTime displaying your timer, time management goals, and a healthy guilt trip to remind you to return to work. 👀\n\n4. RescueTime community sessions\n\nRescueTime is a wiz at implementing body doubling. For extra motivation, join one of its community Focus Sessions. These are Pomodoro-style one-hour or two-hour Focus Sessions happening live worldwide.\n\nIf you don’t want to join the all-hands-on-deck RescueTime sessions, you can always create a shared space with coworkers, colleagues, or strangers while you work. This tricks your brain into thinking other people are holding you accountable and working alongside you, which works wonders for productivity.\n\n5. Time metrics\n\nAwareness is a great time management technique. At the end of every Focus Session, RescueTime will send you detailed reports and graphs illustrating your productivity pulse.\n\nThese reports break down your activities into categories such as “very productive,” “productive,” and “distracting,” allowing you to see where your time is going at a glance. RescueTime will even rank your distractions so you can pinpoint the culprits more quickly. 📌\n\nRescueTime Pricing\n\nFree version\n\nMonthly: $12/month\n\nAnnually: $6.50/month, billed annually for $78\n\nPros of Using RescueTime\n\nChoosing RescueTime as your go-to time-tracking tool comes with plenty of benefits. While RescueTime might not be right for everyone, loyal fans love the app for several reasons.\n\nImproved self-awareness\n\nRescueTime’s metrics, notifications, and distraction reminders make you more aware of your daily routine. Its detailed reports clarify how you spend time, making it easier to identify bad habits and spot opportunities for improvement. It might sting a little to get a slap on the wrist for goofing off when you’re supposed to be working, but it’s all for the sake of boosting your productivity.\n\nFewer distractions\n\nOther time management tools might say, “Hey, you’re distracted!” However, RescueTime takes things a step further by literally blocking distractions. 🛑\n\nIt blocks distracting websites and apps during your designated focus time so you can preserve concentration. This feature is heaven-sent for anyone easily sidetracked by social media and other online distractions, ensuring you give your undivided attention to the most important tasks.\n\nAutomation\n\nRescueTime also has an automatic time-tracking feature that eliminates manual time entries, boosting the accuracy of your timesheets. That’s particularly helpful for freelancers who must provide precise time reports to clients or teams needing to track project management progress.\n\nGoal-setting\n\nRescueTime differs from other solutions because it allows you to set and achieve goals in record time. Set goals for your productive time and get alerts to stay on track. It’s fully customizable, too, so you’re free to make the platform your own.\n\nSmart integrations\n\nRescueTime eliminates the headaches of hopping back and forth between solutions, tools, and platforms. Integrate it with Slack, your calendar, or other project management software to streamline your workflow.\n\nCommon Pain Points RescueTime Users Face\n\nAs much as folks love RescueTime, it has a few setbacks. Users commonly mention these pain points.\n\nLots and lots of data\n\nRescueTime can initially seem overwhelming. It generates impressive data about your habits, but it takes time to make sense of the detailed reports. Like any platform, new users frequently complain about RescueTime’s learning curve. Take time to familiarize yourself with the dashboard and reports and learn how to interpret your metrics correctly. 📈\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\nRescueTime tracks everything you do across all of your tracked devices. Some users rightfully worry about privacy, especially regarding tracking features like screenshots or detailed logs of the websites they visit. RescueTime has robust privacy policies for data governance, but you need to give up some privacy to get the full benefit of the platform.\n\nLimited free features\n\nThe free version of RescueTime doesn’t have the advanced features you’ll get in RescueTime Premium. You won’t have as much freedom to customize goals, block distractions, or generate in-depth reports, which can be a drawback for anyone on a budget. 💸\n\nSyncing issues\n\nYou’ll probably see syncing issues using RescueTime across multiple devices, like your desktop and phone. There are occasional delays or inconsistencies between the desktop and mobile apps, which could give you an inaccurate picture of your productivity.\n\nRescueTime Reviews on Reddit\n\nWhat do the people of the internet really think about RescueTime? We took to Reddit to weigh the good, the bad, and the ugly of this productivity tool.\n\nSome users say RescueTime does a great job, but several had issues with the price of RescueTime Premium ($78 annually). They also mentioned they didn’t think the premium version was much better than the free version.\n\nOther users noticed RescueTime had some pretty big time-tracking discrepancies. “ActivityWatch tracked 17m; Rescuetime said I spent only 8 minutes, which is wrong by a margin. Also, note that they haven’t made significant changes to the Windows app since 2020/05/19. Like WHAT?” one user said.\n\nSome folks said the free version worked just fine, while others liked the premium features but not the premium price. Many users mentioned switching to RescueTime alternatives because of tracking discrepancies and out-of-date apps.\n\nRescueTime has much going for it, but it isn’t the be-all, end-all. This time log tool lacks many features, so you’ll likely still be flipping between different tools to do your work.\n\nEnter ClickUp, an alternative productivity and work management platform that offers time tracking, project management, and much more. 🎯\n\nSmart project time tracking\n\nHow much time do you spend on each project, task, or client? You’ll never know for sure without ClickUp project time tracking.\n\nThis project time-tracking features allow you to track time, create estimates, add notes, and more.

Build a custom dashboard with Time Tracking cards of your choice to get a high-level view of your most important productivity metrics in one place.\n\nSolid time management\n\nTime tracking is one thing—time management is another beast entirely.

Add time estimates to any task or split time between team members to manage expectations and keep your team on task.\n\nIf you’re a visual worker, ClickUp also has something for that.

Templates.\n\nGuess what ClickUp has? Templates by the pound!\n\nYou’re in the driver’s seat with ClickUp. Pull a template and customize it to meet your team’s time-tracking needs.

      "# [Honest RescueTime Review by a Competitor by Jibble.io on 2023-12-09](https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime)\nBy Asim Qureshi, CEO Jibble\n\nAs a CEO of a time tracking software company I need to know what my competitors are up to. That means my team and I are often researching about and/or playing around with their products, you know, it’s part of the job. Here, I share my findings of that research, giving credit to those competitors where credit is due and being honest about which products I believe you really need to avoid. And so, there you have it, this review, and in it, I try to be honest, fair, and insightful. I hope it helps you make the right decision…\n\nThis Review Covers:\n\nOverview\n\nWhat Do Users Like About RescueTime?\n\nWhat Don’t Users Like About RescueTime?\n\nWhat Pricing Plans Does RescueTime Offer?\n\nWhat are the Standout Features of RescueTime?\n\nSelected Positive User Feedback\n\nSelected Negative User Feedback\n\nWhat are RescueTime’s Ratings from Review Sites?\n\nWhat’s My Final Verdict on RescueTime?\n\nOverview\n\nRescueTime is a time management and analytics tool designed to help workers boost efficiency and productivity.\n\nIt automatically tracks time and activities from a user’s device, gathering data on application names, web site URLs, window titles, start time of use, and end time of use. This data is then organized into reports which can be viewed on the app, exported as a CSV file, or sent directly to your email.\n\nOther features that RescueTime is equipped with include Goal Tracking, FocusTime, Timesheets, and custom alerts and notifications.\n\nMy favorite feature on RescueTime has got to be FocusTime, which blocks all the websites classified by the user as personal or distracting. Whether it’s social media, streaming platforms, or online shopping, FocusTime empowers users to reduce interruptions and create a more focused work environment.\n\nWhile the software does work well as an activity analysis software, it lacks some very important features for time tracking and work management.\n\nTo name a few, RescueTime does not have cost calculation, invoicing, scheduling, GPS tracking, or biometric options for clock ins. While it is a valuable productivity enhancement tool, it is not a time and work management solution for freelancers and businesses who need more than just the analytics that RescueTime provides.\n\nAside from these limitations, RescueTime doesn’t do well on mobile. Users have encountered bugs that have led to syncing issues and loss of tracked data. Other times the app would just completely stop working. These issues explain it’s terribly low rating on both the Google Play Store (3.3/5) and App Store (2.7/5).\n\nThere’s definitely a number of pros and cons to using RescueTime. And before you decide if it’s the right tool for you, it’s important to weight them properly. To get a clearer picture, let’s dive deeper into the app’s standout features and what else users have to say.\n\nWhat Do Users Like About RescueTime?\n\nAutomatic time tracking\n\nExcellent productivity analysis\n\nGreat for reducing distractions\n\nFind more on what users love about RescueTime.\n\nWhat Don't Users Like about RescueTime?\n\nData syncing issues\n\nOnly supports English language option\n\nUI needs improvement\n\nMobile syncing and accuracy issues\n\nFind more on what users hate about RescueTime.\n\nWhat Pricing Plans Does RescueTime Offer?\n\nRescueTime has two plan variants: Solo and Team, both plans offering a 14-day free trial.\n\nSolo\n\nThe Solo plan starts at $6.50/month when billed annually and $12/month billed monthly. It offers a comprehensive set of tools designed to help individuals track their time, stay focused, and enhance productivity.\n\nFeatures under the Solo plan include:\n\nAutomatic time-tracking software\n\nTimesheets\n\nProject billable reports\n\nDistraction Blocking and Focus Sessions\n\nReal-time Goals and Alerts\n\nAnalytics and Reporting Tools\n\nWeekly email reports\n\nDesktop, mobile, and browser access\n\nOffline time tracking\n\nDaily highlights\n\nCustom work hours and burnout protection\n\nUnlimited historical data\n\nIntegration with Calendars, Asana, Slack and more\n\nTeam\n\nRescueTime’s Team Plan is priced at $6/month per team member when billed annually and $9/month per team member billed monthly.\n\nThe plan contains very much everything from the Solo plan but with expanded access to streamline productivity and time management for teams. It also includes organization management, consolidated billing for teams, and timesheets for teams.\n\nRead 5 things you MUST know about RescueTime’s pricing.\n\nWhat are the Standout Features of RescueTime?\n\n1. FocusTime\n\nWith the goal of “rescuing” your time, RescueTime has what’s called FocusTime which is basically assisted focus sessions.\n\nWhen FocusTime is enabled, RescueTime automatically blocks out apps and sites categorized as Personal or Distractions. You can customize what to block, set a timer, and work without interruptions.\n\nFocus sessions can be scheduled too, and you’ll get an alert when it’s time to start. When a user enters into a Focus Session, all their devices connected to their RescueTime account will automatically be in focus session as well. Great\n\n2. Activity Tracking\n\nRescueTime’s activity tracking feature works automatically in the background, recording all computer activity a few hours after installation. It tracks the websites and applications you open during your designated tracking periods. For more detailed monitoring, you can configure it to collect specific data like window titles, document names, and URLs.\n\nYou have full control over what RescueTime tracks. You can choose to monitor only specific websites or programs by adding them to a whitelist, while other activities are recorded under general categories like “browsing.” You can also ignore certain applications entirely if they’re not relevant to your productivity tracking.\n\n3. Productivity Pulse\n\nRescueTime’s Productivity Pulse is a simple yet effective tool for tracking productivity. It uses charts to display a productivity score out of 100, calculated based on how users spend their time over a specific period.\n\nThe score is a time-weighted average of five activity categories, ranging from Focused Work Time to Distracting Time. This makes it easy to understand how effectively time is being utilized.\n\nThe visual representation helps users quickly assess their productivity, track their progress, and set goals to improve.\n\nSelected Positive User Feedback:\n\nEasy to understand tracked data on the dashboard. Visual charts are impactful & very helpful. – Jem F. (Source: Capterra)\n\n“Its the best app which helps me to set goals and also in time tracking. It has the feature of automatic time tracking which helps us to understand the hours we worked.” – Verified User in Accounting (Source: G2)\n\n“One of the most useful aspects of RescueTime is its ability to automatically track the time I spend on different apps and websites without the need for manual intervention. This helps me get an accurate and objective picture of my work day without extra effort, the biggest time savings I have is with these features.” – Verified Reviewer (Source: Capterra)\n\n“This tool for our team has been an eye-opening tool for tracking and improving productivity. Its automatic time tracking feature helps users understand how they spend their time on the computer and mobile devices..” – Fernando L. (Source: Capterra)\n\n“The best thing about RescueTime is how after setup you simply forget about it. It works 100% without interaction and at the end of each day you have a comprehensive report on all the activities you performed.” – Lucas P. (Source: Capterra)\n\n“The ease of use is the best of that tool. Without having to remember to start a task or something, it silently records what you are doing in the background.” – Christian H. (Source: Capterra)\n\nSelected Negative User Feedback:\n\n“Great … when it works. I’ve used RT for a few years now and it’s been really useful in helping me to monitor how I spend my time online. Problem is that every few months it stops syncing data. Support was OK but recently I send in reports and get no response. Only solutions they offer is to uninstall and reinstall but that loses data and it doesn’t fix the issue. Works fine on desktop but very poor on tablet & phone.” – R Stimson (Source Google Play Store)\n\n“Can’t use with 2fa, which is insane. RescueTime carries sensitive data that tracks everything I do, so I’m incredulous that they don’t provide the barest of protections for that data.” – T.D. Eastvold (Source: Google Play Store)\n\n“The phone app looks very dated and needs a big UI upgrade, the web app is very nice and informative, I really wish the app could replicate what the web app can do.” – Dinerty (Source: Google Play Store)\n\n“If it works, this app is great. But most of the time it’s busy freezing, crashing or simply not tracking any app activity. ” – Eric (Source: Google Play Store)\n\n“Would like to see better integration between the mobile app and the Windows app, for example, focus times could force the same Android actions automagically. ” – Geoffrey T. (Source: G2)\n\n“It collects all the data and sends storage to its server. I often worry about the data privacy issues with this software, Have to evaluate the tradeoff.” – Tom V. (Source: G2)\n\nWhat are RescueTime's Review Ratings from Review Sites?\n\nAs of January 2025\n\nCapterra: 4.6/5\n\nG2: 4.1/5\n\nTrustRadius: 7.9/10\n\nGetApp: 4.6/5\n\nGoogle Play Store: 3.3/5\n\nApp Store: 2.7/5\n\nWhat's My Final Verdict on RescueTime?\n\nRescueTime is really more of a productivity app than a time tracking software.\n\nIt offers a clear and honest reflection of users’ work habits by meticulously tracking activities from the start to the end of their workday. I like how the data is categorized into user-defined groups and ranked on a five-point productivity scale, ranging from very productive to very distracting. This helps users evaluate their time usage and make necessary adjustments to build healthier productivity habits over time.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that RescueTime is not a replacement for dedicated work management and time tracking tools. It lacks essential features like shift scheduling, billing and invoicing, project progress tracking, and accountability safeguards. While its detailed analytics are impressive, they may overwhelm users seeking simpler, more straightforward reporting.\n\nRescueTime’s unimpessive mobile app is a huge downside too, especially for users who rely on their phones for on-the-go productivity tracking.\n\nIf what you’re after is robust time tracking software with comprehensive features for managing projects and teams, there are other tools on the market that might offer a better fit.",
      "# [RescueTime: Dive into Efficiency [with RescueTime vs Everhour] on 2025-01-19](https://everhour.com/blog/rescuetime-vs-everhour-examining-the-two/)\nMany organizations now apply the best time tracking practices to monitor employee activity and measure team performance to improve business operations. Thanks to time tracking tools, such as RescueTime, monitoring and improving productivity has never been easier. This article will shed light on RescueTime – its main features, pricing, pros & cons, tips and tricks, and compare two popular tools to determine which time tracker will be on top: RescueTime vs Everhour.\n\nWhat Is RescueTime?\n\nWe’ll begin by exploring RescueTime. The tool was created to tackle some of the problems present in the modern workplace, namely, stress, reduced productivity, and burnout. One of the best ways to improve your productivity is to understand how you spend your time, so you can make necessary adjustments. RescueTime tracks your activity on a computer or mobile device and then provides you with insights into how you spend your time.\n\nRescueTime Features\n\nRescue time provides users with a variety of useful features, which we’ll explore in more detail.\n\n🚜 Activity tracking\n\nOne of RescueTime’s best features is its activity-tracking feature. It lets users see exactly what their team members have been doing each day. The feature tracks the time a user spends on a particular website, app, or even a specific document, allowing management to review their team members’ working habits and make adjustments if necessary.\n\n🔖 Activity labeling\n\nOnce RescueTime has collected the necessary data about how you use your time, it will categorize it into how productive it is on a scale with five different productivity levels. Some websites may be deemed as distracting in some roles and productive in others. For example, scrolling through your company’s news website is part of your job if you’re a journalist. As a result, you can mark certain websites as productive rather than distracting.\n\n❗ Work goals and distraction blockers\n\nRescueTime enables you to set a personal daily work goal and allows you to block distractions when necessary during what the platform calls a ‘focus session’. The app tracks what you’re working on and will alert you when you’re beginning to lose focus or trying to work on too many tasks at one time.\n\n📊 Dashboard\n\nThis data is then presented on a dashboard. It gives you a productivity pulse and measures your productivity compared to the previous day. Additionally, the dashboard presents your activities by color: blue being productive, grey as neither productive nor distracted, and red as distracted. Finally, a table of each hour that you’ve worked that day will be populated with the color corresponding to the activity you did during that time.\n\nOnce you’ve used the app for a while, it will give you more detailed insights into how you use your time. For example, if you use the app for a couple of months, you may find that you’re particularly productive on certain days.\n\n📃 Reporting\n\nThe data recorded in the dashboard can be converted into a report, which you can download and share with whoever you like by emailing them a copy within the platform. With a premium subscription, users can view a wealth of information in reports. This includes:\n\n– Detailed activity reporting\n\n– Trends within your activity to show how you work overtime\n\n– A breakdown of your activities by an input source\n\n– The ability to view your data based on customized time filters\n\n– Exporting your data to CSV and filtering data based on specific keywords\n\n🔏 Privacy\n\nRescueTime allows you to disable the platform for certain apps and websites, giving you control over what information is recorded. You can pause the RescueTime app at any time. The app allows you to pause all RescueTime activity for 15 minutes, an hour, or until tomorrow to give you privacy.\n\nPlus, you can schedule the app to only record your activity at certain times of day, outside of these times, the app will not track your activity. That’s not all—you can also restrict which websites RescueTime logs by creating a white list of websites you would like RescueTime to track.\n\n🔁 Integrations\n\nYou can allow other apps to use your RescueTime data. The app can be integrated with several platforms, including but not limited to\n\nThese integrations enable you to get the most out of the platform. You can also export reports to a CSV file, but only if you have a premium subscription.\n\n🔧 Support and platforms\n\nRescueTime offers various support options if you encounter problems. The first port of call is the RescueTime knowledge base, where you’ll find informative articles about the platform, troubleshooting information, and FAQs. Suppose these pages do not help you fix a problem. In that case, you can contact the RescueTime team on the company website using the contact form, leave a phone message or email the team at contact@rescuetime.com.\n\nRescueTime is a web-based platform, but it also has a mobile app that lets you track mobile phone usage. The RescueTime app is available on Android and IOS.\n\n💲 Pricing\n\nRescueTime offers a free version of the app with limited features. The RescueTime premium plan, which includes all the outlined features, costs $6.50 a month per user when billed yearly.\n\n❓ Alternatives\n\nRescueTime is a great app if your main goal is to track your productivity. However, it does not offer the same billing and invoicing features as other time tracking and productivity apps on the market. If you’re looking for an alternative app to increase your productivity, consider Todoist.\n\nThe app is used by millions of people to plan and collaborate on projects of all sizes. You can write to-do lists, create labels, set priority levels to highlight your most pressing tasks, set reminders, highlight favorites, and delegate tasks to team members. Additionally, you can see tangible progress through productivity visualizations, which, by week and month, help you stay on track to achieve set goals.\n\n✅❌ Pros and cons of RescueTime\n\nWhy users might be looking for a RescueTime alternative?\n\nWhile RescueTime is fully functional and can take care of most of your needs, it’s worth taking a look at some of the drawbacks users might encounter when using it.\n\n1️⃣ Occasionally, it can be challenging to allocate a recorded activity to a specific project, particularly when managing multiple concurrent projects that require the same tools.\n\nEverhour simplifies the process of allocating recorded activities to specific projects, even when managing numerous concurrent projects with similar tool requirements.

Also, managing time-tracking offline could present some challenges.\n\nEverhour offers comprehensive tutorials, onboarding assistance, and a user-friendly interface to ease the learning curve for new users. Additionally, its efficient time-tracking features ultimately save time and enhance productivity, offsetting any initial learning investments.\n\nWhile Everhour’s pricing may appear slightly higher, its value lies in its extensive features, customizable options, and reliable customer support, making it a worthwhile investment for businesses seeking top-tier time-tracking solutions.\n\nWith Everhour’s mobile app and offline time tracking capabilities, users can seamlessly track their time from anywhere, ensuring accurate records even when internet connectivity is limited.

With its sleek design and user-friendly layout, Everhour can address concerns about outdated interfaces, offering a more enjoyable and efficient time-tracking solution.\n\n4️⃣ Users may find that the API capabilities of RescueTime are very limited, and updates to the platform may sometimes result in a less satisfactory experience rather than improvements.\n\nEverhour offers a robust and flexible API that allows for seamless integration with other tools and platforms. Additionally, Everhour continuously enhances its features based on user feedback, ensuring that updates improve the user experience rather than detract from it.\n\nAs you can see, Everhour is an intuitive attendance tracker that enables users to track time, estimate tasks, set budgets for projects, and build detailed reports to distribute internally or send to clients.

Use a native timer or enter the time you worked on a task manually. Plus, you can set time estimates so you can see how much time you’ve got left to spend on a chosen task. You can also set reminders, so you receive notifications about long-running timers.\n\nIf that wasn’t enough, with Everhour, managers can review and approve timesheets (via a timesheet app) for their team members, allowing them to easily keep track of the hours their team is working.\n\n📚 Task management\n\nTask management has never been easier because of Everhour.

With all your tasks laid out in front of you, it’s easy to know what you should be working on.\n\n🧮 Billing and invoicing\n\nOne of Everhour’s key strengths is its billing and invoicing capabilities. You can create new invoices based on tracked time and relevant expenses, use dynamic variables that will be replaced with real data in invoice line items, translate invoice labels, apply online invoice generator, and connect with accounting platforms such as QuickBooks, FreshBooks, or Xero to sync your clients, and copy invoices.\n\nAdditionally, Everhour enables you to track work-related expenses attach receipts to expenses, and use unit pricing per expense category.\n\n📃 Reporting\n\nEverhour provides in-depth reporting, allowing you to access analytics to increase productivity and show your clients exactly what they are paying for. You can create custom reports using filters to arrange columns and add certain conditions to create the reports you require. Plus, you can gain a deeper understanding of tasks using metadata such as tags, task types, or specific milestones.\n\nOnce you’ve created a report, you can share it with your team members or download it to send to a client. To save time, you can schedule reports to send to a list of email addresses on a specified day, on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.\n\n🌟 Project management\n\nOne thing that makes Everhour different from other time tracking software is the project management capabilities the platform offers. Everhour offers users real integration by injecting time management controls into your chosen project management platform, be it Trello, Jira, or ClickUp (or Monday project management), and enjoy their PM features with time tracking controls, so you and your team members don’t need to duplicate information on two different platforms.\n\n🔁 Integrations\n\nEverhour integrates seamlessly into dozens of different applications, allowing you to say goodbye to tab switching once and for all! You can integrate Everhour with a wide selection of platforms, including but not limited to Asana, Basecamp, ClickUp, Jira, Trello, Monday, GitHub, and QuickBooks.\n\nIntegrating Everhour with your chosen project management or accounting platforms allows you and your team members to stay on the same page.\n\n🔧 Support and platforms\n\nEverhour offers support to users in various ways. The first port of call can be found on the Everhour Help Docs page, where you’ll find helpful user guides which run you through the platform’s many features. If you face problems that cannot be fixed with the help of the user guides, you can contact Everhour using the contact form on the company’s website.\n\nRegarding platforms, Everhour is a cloud-based solution. As a result, all you need to do is download Everhour’s browser extension, which is available on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge browsers. In addition, Evethour is currently beta testing an app, which is available to download via the Apple Store.\n\n💲 Pricing\n\nEverhour offers simple pricing with no extra fees. There is a Free plan with basic time tracking and reporting features. A monthly subscription to Everhour costs $5 and $8.50 per month per user if billed annually. A Team plan subscription includes all features, including unlimited users, projects, integrations, and fast and responsive support should you encounter any problems.\n\n❓ Alternatives\n\nEverhour is an intuitive time tracking software with many excellent features. However, it may not be the best fit for all users, and it isn’t the only tool available. A great alternative to Everhour is Time Doctor. Time Doctor is a great alternative to Everhour because it offers user-friendly time tracking, distraction management, reporting, payroll, and integration features, all in one easy-to-use app.\n\n✅❌ Pros and cons of Everhour\n\nRescueTime vs. Everhour: Pros and Cons\n\nRescueTime\n\n✅ Pros:\n\n– Runs in the background as you work, allowing you to seamlessly track productivity\n\n– Fast and responsive support is available, should you run into issues\n\n– Daily and weekly performance monitoring displayed in an easy-to-understand dashboard\n\n❌ Cons:\n\n– The user interface is not as intuitive as other platforms on the market\n\n– Fewer integration options than other similar tools\n\n– Limited project management capabilities compared to other time tracking platforms on the market\n\n– Limited customization\n\n– No team attendance reports are available\n\nEverhour\n\n✅ Pros:\n\n– Great for teams working either remotely or in the office, making collaboration easier\n\n– Lots of project management and accounting integrations to use\n\n– Great reporting tools that allow you to improve business operations\n\n– Simple interface\n\n– Affordable pricing for teams\n\n❌ Cons:\n\n– No offline usability option\n\n– No Android app available at present\n\nThe Verdict: RescueTime vs Everhour\n\nWhile RescueTime focuses on its key feature, activity-tracking, to increase productivity, Everhour gives users greater variety in terms of available features.

      "# [Best time management app of 2025 by Jonas P. DeMuro, Craig Hale on 2022-05-22](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-time-management-solution)\nWe list the best time management apps, to make it simple and easy to manage and track time, tasks, and improve productivity goals for yourself or employees.\n\nThis is important, because time management is an essential skill to learn when involved with running a business, department, or other managerial duties.\n\nMany workers find that they struggle to fit in all their designated work into a day, with some studies uncovering the alarmingly high amount of time we spend in (often pointless) video calls each week - accounting for an estimated fifth of our time. A good time management app will help any individual to understand their working day and prioritize the right tasks as they reach optimal workload management, but it should also be easy to use without adding to the burden.\n\nMost of the apps we looked at offer individual as well as team tracking, and provide features for tracking time not least for counting billable time, Internet use, and time spent on an individual project. This can be useful for a variety of working types, ranging from businesses to self-employed workers who want to get a better understanding of how they spend their time to be able to generate more accurate invoices for clients.\n\nSome have goals built into them, or general analysis of time used through the day, to help you better identify time sinks and lazy periods when you can be more productive.\n\nWhere team features are available, this allows you to compare your own performance with others from your team, and use insights into how to not just better manage your own time, but how others in the team can learn from each other to do the same.\n\nHere then, are the best time management apps currently available in 2025.\n\nWe've also featured the best accounting software for small business.\n\nThe best time management apps of 2025 in full:\n\nBest time management app for automation\n\nTimecamp has a number of simple-to-use functions related to time tracking aimed at maximizing team productivity. The feature set includes billable time tracking, sending invoices based on time spent, an attendance tracker, and team time tracking.\n\nThere is also automated time tracking which can be used for employee Internet usage monitoring, and to assign an entry to the correct project. The time management software function puts this all together to be able to track a team’s time spent on a project, and also their productivity.\n\nAdmins can also benefit from reporting to help them understand how their time is being spent. Not only does this provide insight into workers’ efficiency, but it can be a valuable tool for tracking projects that are run by different funding pots, which is a very common scenario in non-profit organizations that receive funding from grants.\n\nIt also can integrate with over 50 productivity tools for ease of use, including project management tools like Airtable, Asana, and Monday.com, as well as communication and video conferencing platforms like Teams and Slack, accounting software like Xero, and numerous calendar apps.\n\nThere is a free tier for limited use as it only supports a single user. The next higher plan is the Basic tier, which has no limit on the number of users, supports billable time functions and offers both a monthly and annual subscription. There are also Pro and Enterprise plans for larger organizations.\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nBest time management app for mobiles\n\nWonder no more “where the day has gone,” with the Chrometa software that can capture automatically the tasks that you and your team work on. It does this by capturing the URL of the website that you visit, the subject and addressee information from an email, and the file info when working on a local file - and stops the clock when you go away from the computer. It can also track things like mouse movements across Windows and macOS devices, which can be a good way of monitoring pauses but may raise some privacy concerns.\n\nThere’s also an emphasis on finances, with features like budget monitoring and the promise of minimizing admin costs. There’s a healthy number of integrations, including numerous finance-related ones like Quickbooks, Xero, and Freshbooks, however beyond this, it doesn’t quite meet the level of other rivals.\n\nThis time management app also captures, via Android and iOS apps, phone calls and text messages to turn time on a mobile device into billable time as well.\n\nThere is the offer of a 30-day free trial, but no free plan so it’s not necessarily a cost-effective solution for smaller businesses. There are three tiers, each with differing numbers of supported devices, data storage, and levels of support. They’re billed on a per-user basis.\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nBest time management app for multiple devices\n\nToggl takes a simplistic approach to time management, with included tracking reminders, and idle detection to make sure the job gets done which can be especially useful for remote workers who find themselves getting distracted. It also has cross-platform support, so for example, time tracking can begin in the browser of a desktop PC, and then be stopped on a smartphone with time entries synced between devices; there are mobile apps and browser extensions to accomplish this, but you won’t have a large pick of the best browsers: only Chrome and Firefox are supported.\n\nToggl also makes it simple to break down your hours worked, by either the project, the client, or the task, and can then analyze them to determine which is making the best return for the hours spent to facilitate maximizing profits. The Toggl app is simple, but unfortunately, it does not support invoicing.\n\nThere’s Sign in with Google support which could suit a large number of businesses using Google Workspace, and also Sign in with Apple for those tied into the Apple ecosystem.\n\nIntegrations are aplenty and include services from Zoho, Asana, Adobe, and Google. There’s also an API available to be able to track something that Toggl Track doesn’t already support, making it one of the most powerful tools out there.\n\nA free tier for up to five workers is available, along with a pair of paid plans and an Enterprise plan that can be customized. Pricing is fairly average, though not cheap, but there are savings to be had for annual subscriptions. All plans also come with a 30-day free trial with no payment card required, so you can really get to know the time tracker before committing to any big spends.\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nBest time management app for currency support\n\nFor freelancers and companies alike, Tmetric dubs itself a ‘work time tracker,’ which via a clean interface provides “great control over time intervals and project budgets.” The key is a visual timeline that gives insight into the activities throughout the day, which you can turn into billable hours.\n\nTmetric boasts over 40,000 users, and over nine million hours of time tracked, including time off, team management, and reporting for all tiers (to varying degrees).\n\nThe process can be automated as there are browser add-ons to directly and seamlessly capture every minute of data to feed back into Tmetric, which is then tracked, to totally capture each and every billable minute. It also benefits from compatibility with all major PC and mobile operating systems, including Linux, so most businesses should be able to use it in some form.\n\nFurthermore, there is support for different currencies, and the ability to track costs per team, to help maximize income while keeping projects within a predefined budget. Finally, tasks can be tracked by individual team members to follow their productivity, and compared to their peers.\n\nThis flexible time management app has a free tier that supports up to 5 users. The Professional tier is available which adds billable rates, invoicing and to-do lists. The top tier Business plan adds Timesync with Jira and Redmine, and can provide cost rates for employees. Both paid plans have a 30-day free trial available, and there are discounts for annual subscriptions.\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nBest time management app for focus\n\nRescueTime has the laudable goal of eliminating distractions and focusing on productivity. It is quite feature-rich and allows you to set goals, providing each user with feedback such as alerts when daily goals have been met.\n\nBesides the features you’d expect, there are some health-focused additions like daily focus and coaching tips. In fact, the company claims that driving for sky-high productivity can become toxic, and is an advocate of the four-day working week.\n\nThere is a free plan called RescueTime Lite that can track time used on websites, set goals, and even provides a weekly email report. More serious time management aficionados can step up to the sole choice of a paid plan, known as RescueTime Premium.\n\nRescueTime tracks what you're working on and will let you know if you're trying to do too much at once or otherwise losing focus. We think it's one of the best time management apps for helping you stay on task.\n\nIt’s worth noting that, while there’s support for both of the leading operating systems, Windows users will need to be running Windows 10 or later. That should be fine, because figures suggest that many businesses are sticking to 10 and taking a more cautious approach to Windows 11, though there may still be some organizations that require older operating systems. macOS support extends back to 2016’s 10.12 Sierra.\n\nThe paid plan builds on the free offering with additional features including tracking time away from the computer (such as phone calls), keeping a log of daily accomplishments, and the ability to block distracting websites. There is a free 14-day trial for the paid tier. Additionally, users will have the pick of a modern-looking “New RescueTime” or the detailed “RescueTime Classic,” though it’s unclear how long both will be supported.\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nBest time management app for security\n\nDo you need a time management app that allays your privacy concerns about sending data to the cloud? ManicTime is downloadable software that is run locally and keeps its data local and does not connect to some remote server. You’ll be fine if you use Windows, macOS, and even Linux, but mobile support only extends to Android users so workers conducting business from their iOS devices won’t be able to benefit from it.\n\nJust like the cloud-based solutions above, it can automatically keep track of time spent, whether on a local file, or through a website. ManicTime also integrates with task-based systems, like Github or Jira. The software can also be used for creating timesheets for workers who need to report back to a manager, for example those working on multiple projects simultaneously.\n\nManicTime makes it easy to turn your tracked hours into custom reports, presenting any additional data you might require. These are formatted and ready for import into your preferred spreadsheet or invoicing software.\n\nThe software is available to download for a one-time fee, however support and updates are only supported for one year after which you can either carry on with the version you ended on or pay again to continue receiving updates.\n\nIf you like using ManicTime but decided you'd prefer a time management app with cloud functionality, there's a cloud-based version too, which works on an ongoing subscription basis.\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nBest lightweight time management app\n\nTicking off items on a to-do list is hugely satisfying, and is a time-honored way to manage your time and get more done during the day. While Todoist isn’t strictly a time-tracking app, it’s a perfect entry-level option for workers seeking to manage their allocation of work.\n\nTodoist is a simple but effective tool for desktop and mobile that lets you set recurring events and essential one-off tasks, and check them off once they're complete. You'll receive a schedule of jobs at the start of each day (unless you choose not to), giving you a sneak peak of what lays ahead so you can prioritize your work according to your schedule and preferences.\n\nTasks are collected in groups called 'Projects', though these might be more accurately called 'Activities'. The default options include shopping, personal, errands and work, and you can add or edit them to suit you.\n\nSome features are exclusive to the premium version, and unfortunately, you won’t always know until you try to select one, but the free version has plenty of tools to help you achieve more every day.\n\nIf you're looking for a more heavy-duty tool for tasks with multiple parts and deadlines, take a look at Trello. It's generally a better tool for business use, whereas Todoist is perfect for your own personal tasks and better suited to individual, self-employed workers and small, close teams.\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nWe've also featured the best to do list apps.\n\nMore time management software options\n\nThere are a lot of software apps available for different aspects of accounts and productivity, and time management is no different. Here we'll feature a selection of additional platforms worth considering as well as those above:\n\nClockify is a simple time tracker and timesheet app for teams that has the distinction of also being free. While that usually means a trade-off in terms of features, Clockify manages to retain essential functionality. Aside from a time tracker and timesheets, it also provides the ability to set up and manage projects and teams, as well as a dashboard to provide an overview of projects as well as analytics based on use.\n\nFocusBooster is another paid time management app that offers simple time tracking as well as a to-do list and productivity reports. However, it takes a more unique approach in encouraging work in small bursts with breaks in between so that you can balance work with life and play. There's a free tier available, but even paid pricing remains relatively cheap depending on the number of features required.\n\nTick offers a more advanced time tracking solution for specifically working with teams, and offers mobile apps for use with Android and iOS as well as for desktop PCs. At its core is a time track which allows managers to then track budgets and profitability. Tick can also be integrated with other productivity software such as Basecamp.\n\nHubStaff is another managerial time tracking solution, offering a wide range of features such as timesheets, GPS tracking, team scheduling, productivity monitoring, and of course reporting for insights. You can import projects or start new ones, and begin time tracking from then. There's also a wide range of integrations available, from Asana to Zoho Projects.\n\nHarvest gears itself more toward larger companies, with customers including Volkswagen and Dell. There are desktop and mobile apps, and integrations with some key services like Google Chrome and GitHub. Admins can also manage projects and the software supports invoice issuing with companies like Stripe and PayPal. There’s a free version available, and the single paid tier also represents good value for money.\n\nProductive appeals to agencies with a variety of workers under their umbrellas, and has all the usual time tracking features. It markets itself as a “one-stop shop,” so you can also expect resource planning tools, budgeting, billing, reporting, and more. It’s not a particularly cheap piece of kit, but should help you eliminate the need for other software so may work out cheaper if you’re likely to use everything. A trio of paid tiers each with free trials and annual subscription savings are topped by a customizable enterprise plan\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nWe've also featured the best employee scheduling software.\n\nBest time management app FAQs\n\nWhat is a time management app?\n\nTime management apps come in various shapes and sizes, but they all have one thing in common. They track the time that you spend on activities you wish to track.\n\nThis is useful for businesses tracking hours worked by remote staff, or for freelancers who need to know how many hours they have spent working on a particular project.\n\nBeyond tracking hours, some time tracking apps can automatically generate invoices, give you tips on working more efficiently, and even warn you if you're losing focus.\n\nHow to choose the best time management app for you\n\nChoosing the best time management app for you starts with understanding how you want to use the data captured. If you want to track your own work and have no need for integration with other software, a no-frills free time tracker could be all you ever need.\n\nIndividuals who want an app that keeps them focused and helps with invoicing would be better served by a more advanced app. Similarly, business users who wish to track multiple employees will benefit from a cloud-based time management app with enhanced reporting features.\n\nShould I pay for a time management app?\n\nThere are some free versions available, but in the majority of cases you’ll find yourself paying for a time management app, especially if you need premium features like reporting, timesheets, billing, and so on.\n\nHowever, ask yourself whether it’s a time management app you need. Maybe your business could benefit from a scheduling app, or an employee scheduling app.\n\nHow we tested the best time management apps\n\nTo test for the best time management apps we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, whether as a download or as an online service. We then tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each software platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools. As well as comparing different price points, we compared time management apps with other, similar pieces of kit to help determine whether the features included represent good value for money, or whether they already come as part of another service you could already be paying for.\n\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\n\nGet in touch\n\nWant to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?
