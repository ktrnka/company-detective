RescueTime fosters a community through forums and discussions, encouraging users to share insights and tips on productivity [(RescueTime, 2024-06-02)](https://everhour.com/blog/rescuetime-vs-everhour-examining-the-two/).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nThe specific names and roles of key personnel at RescueTime were not detailed in the provided content. However, the leadership team is described as consisting of experienced professionals in technology and productivity, emphasizing the importance of work-life balance and productivity [(Jibble.io, 2023-12-09)](https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime).\n\n# News\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### New Integrations and Features\n\n- **Slack Integration**: In May 2024, RescueTime introduced an integration with Slack, allowing users to automatically update their Slack status based on their work categories.

While RescueTime excels in automatic tracking and productivity analysis, it lacks some features found in competitors, such as invoicing and project management tools. Users have noted that while RescueTime is excellent for personal productivity, it may not fully meet the needs of teams requiring comprehensive project management capabilities [(Jibble.io, 2023-12-09)](https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime).\n\n## User Feedback and Reviews\n\n### Positive Feedback\n\n- Users appreciate the **automatic tracking** feature, which provides an accurate overview of their daily activities without manual input.

Additionally, there are privacy concerns regarding the extensive data tracking capabilities of the software [(Jibble.io, 2023-12-09)](https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime).\n- The **pricing** for the premium version has been criticized as being high relative to the features offered, especially when compared to competitors that provide more comprehensive project management tools [(Jibble.io, 2023-12-09)](https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime).\n\nIn conclusion, RescueTime is a robust tool for individuals and teams looking to enhance productivity through automatic time tracking and detailed reporting. While it has received positive feedback for its core features, it faces challenges in mobile performance and competition from more comprehensive project management tools. As the company continues to innovate and expand its integrations, it remains a strong contender in the productivity software market.",

      "# [Privacy Policy](https://www.rescuetime.com/privacy)\nMost recent version: July 10, 2023.\n\nBy using RescueTime, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your personal information for the purposes of providing you our product services as described below. We will notify all active accounts of any significant changes to this policy.\n\nYour data is never shared\n\nYour privacy is really important to us. At RescueTime, your data, analyzed, is the product we offer back to you. We are not an ad supported company. Our free service is intended to entice you to premium service. If you have any concerns that aren't covered here, please contact us. Below are the details of this policy:\n\nWe will never sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal information, with or without personally identifying information. Furthermore, we will never share anonymized selections of your individual data. That includes any government (foreign or domestic) unless we are compelled by law. If we are required by law to disclose any of the information collected about you, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email. We will independently object to overly broad requests for access to information about users of our site.\n\nWe may share information about user behavior in the aggregate only. For example, we could share information like, \"which day of the week do people spend the most time in front of their computer?\" This type of analysis is used to enrich the product, and to represent our domain expertise to our audiences.\n\nYou can delete your data at any time — all of it, or just a slice of it. You can also delete your account at any time. Deleting your account deletes all your data from our database.\n\nWe won't spam you, ever, either directly or indirectly by sharing of email information. We might occasionally send one-time messages about important RescueTime news. We will likely continue to introduce ways that you can optionally have RescueTime contact you with data that you care about, but you will always be able to turn this on or off.\n\nFor individual accounts, no other user can see any of your data or personal information. We may provide features to allow you to share selections of your data, but this will be voluntary and opt-in only, and handled per-situation, and not buried in a terms of service.\n\nFor team accounts, sharing of data is controlled by the administrator of the account and by default does not allow anyone in the team account access to your data. No one outside of your organization will have access to any of your data. Default team implementations do not permit the sharing of individual data in any form that is not aggregated (eg, your team's average communication per week). When consulting with team implementations, we promote transparency and user driven control.\n\nHow do we protect your data?\n\nYour data is always encrypted in transit. All requests with the RescueTime web app and client apps are encrypted with current best practice SSL configurations.\n\nYour data is always encrypted at rest. All of our storage uses volume encryption.\n\nWe maintain ongoing vulnerability scanning, respond immediately to security advisories, and stay PCI compliant.\n\nWhat information does RescueTime collect? How is it used?\n\nAccount information includes email address (verification optional), city, state, and country. Optional demographic information includes gender, date of birth, industry, job title, company size, and income may be requested, to enrich the accuracy of our reporting for your work patterns.\n\nRescueTime records information about the currently active application or website on your computer. We record for processing the following information: 1) for time analysis: application name, web site URL, window title, start time of use, end time of use and 2) for distinguishing you and your device: device login name (your system user name), device name, device operating system version, and sometimes the manufacturer. For some inputs, the public internet address you are operating from is saved, for your security (and ours), and for troubleshooting. Like all activity information, it is discarded with account deletion.\n\nWe do not (and never will) collect keystrokes, form input, screenshots, window or page body content, or anything nefarious. Before storage for your reports, URLs are trimmed to the site name and sometimes top level directory when a site has distinct web apps. Query strings are discarded. Site controls allow you to selectively delete and ignore forever any item you prefer not be stored.\n\nCookies and Log Files\n\nRescueTime.com sends a \"cookie\" to your computer that contains an identifier that is unique to your browser session. We use this cookie to validate your authentication, provide you with a continuous experience, and to record how our site/service is being used. It is not used for marketing purposes.\n\nAs is done with most web sites, we log each visit to each web page. A log entry can contain information typically found in the \"header\" of your web browser's request such as the browser type you used, your Internet Protocol address, and the date and time of day. We may also log your session identifier and the URL of a site that referred you. This log information is important for security, audit, quality improvement, as well as for monitoring the health of our service.",
      "# [RescueTime Security](https://www.rescuetime.com/security)\nInfrastructure and Platform: Safe Foundations\n\nA secure design for hardware, networks, and deployments.\n\nTo make RescueTime work, there are two principle components: the application that runs on your device and the cloud-based service that processes the data and builds results for you. The client runs on multiple platforms and devices (Windows, Apple OS X, Linux, Android, ChromeOS), and is principally responsible for automatically measuring how the device is used. The client also offers some additional user-facing features that are best delivered outside the browser. The cloud service receives data from the client and also provides the client with statistics and configuration information to enrich the user's experience and manage client features.\n\nThe Client Application Platform\n\nFor desktop systems, the client is built on a common codebase using standard cross-platform libraries that work across Windows, OS X and Linux. This encompasses the code used for secure communication with our servers, as well as configuration handling and time logic. We maintain our client with regular updates, publish change information, audit and test all changes, and track dependent library security updates. Our client is designed to be lightweight, with a negligible memory and processor footprint, using a compact codebase and minimized complexity to reduce risk.\n\nFor mobile systems, we currently support automatic time collection on Android devices, including phones and tablets. Our app is built entirely inside the Android SDK and so takes advantage of the Google Android team's own security provisions (app sandboxing, regular platform maintenance updates, etc).\n\nMore about how the client works >>\n\nThe Cloud Service Platform\n\nRescueTime data processing, reporting, and account management is handled through our website locations, which are all hosted on Amazon's EC2 facility. Out of the box, EC2 gives us audited robust infrastructure security, both physical and network level. On that foundation, we provide additional feature-targeted firewalling, privilege separation and controls, two-factor access methods, and logged, auditable operations interfaces. Our website services are built on common open-source platforms, apps and frameworks that we monitor for regular security maintenance updates, both at the operating system level and for required apps and libraries.\n\nAll operational interaction with our platform is accomplished through either HTTPS or SSH (secure tunnels). Our testing and development deployments are maintained in a matching configuration, with access only through HTTPS and SSH tunnels. We do not maintain any office based data storage or services. All of our engineering resources are secured in EC2 under the same practices and policies applied to the production configuration.\n\nMore about the site and web services >>\n\nRescueTime and HIPAA, HITECH, SAS70 and more\n\nHow regulations and policies may affect you.\n\nHIPAA / HITECH: privacy and security requirements\n\nWe have clients, including individuals and teams, in many different lines of business. Some have concerns driven by protection of intellectual property, others have regulatory requirements. For those under HIPAA compliance standards for their software purchases:\n\nIs it even required? HIPAA requirements are triggered when a software product maintains patient identifiable information. For this reason, your use of RescueTime would likely be covered by HIPAA, because some applications' window titles may have a patient's name or similar small but identifiable detail. It would be possible to take advantage of our privacy configurations and controls to restrict what is captured and measured, to prevent this requirement altogether while using RescueTime. However, this may limit the utility of the product to you.\n\n... So, assuming you need HIPAA compliance to use RescueTime:\n\nSecure network transmission: HIPAA requires that all transmission of data between your business or our software be encrypted. RescueTime meets this requirement.\n\nPhysical security: The service must be hosted in an access limited and monitored facility. RescueTime meets this requirement by maintaining all resources in Amazon's EC2 data center.\n\nAccess control: Operational access to the service must be secured for authorized use only and be auditable. RescueTime meets this requirement.\n\nSafe practices and policies: The service should maintain disaster recovery plans and offsite backups. RescueTime meets this requirement, primarily by leveraging features of Amazon's EC2 service.\n\nThe HITECH supplement requires SaaS products to report intrusion or security events that effect customers' data. Specifically, the requirement is that if customer data resides in storage unencrypted (for example, a backup), even in a secured environment, that the service provider (us) must notify all and any customers whose data could have been vulnerable as the result of an intrusion event or other security violation. RescueTime guarantees its customers that it will alert any and all customers possibly affected by a security defect or hacking event.\n\nNote: At this time, RescueTime has not contracted an audit firm to provide third party validation of compliance. Please contact sales@rescuetime.com for more information on how we can accommodate your needs.\n\nSAS70 and the rest\n\nRescueTime is a fast growing business, and we contract services as needed as we continue to grow. As of this time we have not engaged our own SAS70 audit. Much of what these audits require is covered simply by operating on EC2. However, the web site services above and beyond the platform level is not. We are happy to consider all questions regarding obtaining audits. We have some clients that perform their own tests against our system to ensure we meet their standards.",

      "# [Privacy Policy](https://www.rescuetime.com/rtx/privacy)\nMost recent version: July 10, 2023.\n\nBy using RescueTime, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your personal information for the purposes of providing you our product services as described below. We will notify all active accounts of any significant changes to this policy.\n\nYour data is never shared\n\nYour privacy is really important to us. At RescueTime, your data, analyzed, is the product we offer back to you. We are not an ad supported company. Our free service is intended to entice you to premium service. If you have any concerns that aren't covered here, please contact us. Below are the details of this policy:\n\nWe will never sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal information, with or without personally identifying information. Furthermore, we will never share anonymized selections of your individual data. That includes any government (foreign or domestic) unless we are compelled by law. If we are required by law to disclose any of the information collected about you, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email. We will independently object to overly broad requests for access to information about users of our site.\n\nWe may share information about user behavior in the aggregate only. For example, we could share information like, \"which day of the week do people spend the most time in front of their computer?\" This type of analysis is used to enrich the product, and to represent our domain expertise to our audiences.\n\nYou can delete your data at any time — all of it, or just a slice of it. You can also delete your account at any time. Deleting your account deletes all your data from our database.\n\nWe won't spam you, ever, either directly or indirectly by sharing of email information. We might occasionally send one-time messages about important RescueTime news. We will likely continue to introduce ways that you can optionally have RescueTime contact you with data that you care about, but you will always be able to turn this on or off.\n\nFor individual accounts, no other user can see any of your data or personal information. We may provide features to allow you to share selections of your data, but this will be voluntary and opt-in only, and handled per-situation, and not buried in a terms of service.\n\nFor team accounts, sharing of data is controlled by the administrator of the account and by default does not allow anyone in the team account access to your data. No one outside of your organization will have access to any of your data. Default team implementations do not permit the sharing of individual data in any form that is not aggregated (eg, your team's average communication per week). When consulting with team implementations, we promote transparency and user driven control.\n\nHow do we protect your data?\n\nYour data is always encrypted in transit. All requests with the RescueTime web app and client apps are encrypted with current best practice SSL configurations.\n\nYour data is always encrypted at rest. All of our storage uses volume encryption.\n\nWe maintain ongoing vulnerability scanning, respond immediately to security advisories, and stay PCI compliant.\n\nWhat information does RescueTime collect? How is it used?\n\nAccount information includes email address (verification optional), city, state, and country. Optional demographic information includes gender, date of birth, industry, job title, company size, and income may be requested, to enrich the accuracy of our reporting for your work patterns.\n\nRescueTime records information about the currently active application or website on your computer. We record for processing the following information: 1) for time analysis: application name, web site URL, window title, start time of use, end time of use and 2) for distinguishing you and your device: device login name (your system user name), device name, device operating system version, and sometimes the manufacturer. For some inputs, the public internet address you are operating from is saved, for your security (and ours), and for troubleshooting. Like all activity information, it is discarded with account deletion.\n\nWe do not (and never will) collect keystrokes, form input, screenshots, window or page body content, or anything nefarious. Before storage for your reports, URLs are trimmed to the site name and sometimes top level directory when a site has distinct web apps. Query strings are discarded. Site controls allow you to selectively delete and ignore forever any item you prefer not be stored.\n\nHow long is your data retained?\n\nAll your data is destroyed in its entirety when you delete your account, except account activity logs required for business audit records. This process can take up to 3 days to protect against accidental deletion. Users can request immediate deletion by contacting support.\n\nYou can delete your own data at any time on our website in the Data & Privacy section of account settings.\n\nFree account user data older than 15 months is automatically deleted on a continuous basis.\n\nCookies and Log Files\n\nRescueTime.com sends a \"cookie\" to your computer that contains an identifier that is unique to your browser session. We use this cookie to validate your authentication, provide you with a continuous experience, and to record how our site/service is being used. It is not used for marketing purposes.\n\nAs is done with most web sites, we log each visit to each web page. A log entry can contain information typically found in the \"header\" of your web browser's request such as the browser type you used, your Internet Protocol address, and the date and time of day. We may also log your session identifier and the URL of a site that referred you. This log information is important for security, audit, quality improvement, as well as for monitoring the health of our service.",
      "# [RescueTime API Documentation](https://www.rescuetime.com/rtx/developers)\nConnecting to the RescueTime API\n\nThere are two ways to connect to a user’s data in RescueTime, via API Keys or via an Oauth2 Connection. The API keys are ideal for personal use, while web services wishing to offer a way for their users to use their RescueTime data should use an Oauth2 connection.\n\nAPI Key Access:\n\nUsers can set up an API key by going to their key management page and creating a new key. That key must be included with each API request. The user can revoke keys at any time.\n\nOauth2 Connection Access:\n\nPlease contact us and we’ll work with you to set up an Oauth2 application. After the user connects their account via Oauth2, an access token will be created. That access token must be included in each API request. The user can revoke access to a service at any time.\n\nOauth2 Authorization Flow\n\nOnce we have created your Oauth2 application, your app will be assigned a client_id and a client_secret. These tokens can then be used, along with the secure redirect_uri provided in the request for an oauth application, in the following steps to authorize your application's user access to their RescueTime data:\n\nA GET request to the following URL:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&response_type=code&scope=YOUR_SCOPES\n\nThis will return the auth_code, which will expire in 10 minutes.\n\nA POST request to the following URL:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/oauth/token\n\nwith a JSON body of:\n\n{\n\n\"client_id\": YOUR_CLIENT_ID,\n\n\"client_secret\": YOUR_APP_SECRET,\n\n\"grant_type\": \"authorization_code\",\n\n\"code\": AUTH_CODE,\n\n\"redirect_uri\": YOUR_REDIRECT_URI\n\n}\n\nThis will return the access_token\n\nData can then be accessed with the access_token, as shown in this example URL:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/data?access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN&by=interval&taxonomy=productivity&interval=hour&restrict_begin=2018-01-01&restrict_end=2018-01-31&format=json&scopes=time_data\n\nOauth2 Access Scopes\n\nWhen users connect their accounts to your application via Oauth2, you can specify access scopes to let the user know exactly how you will be using their RescueTime data. Scopes will be requested during the initial authorization request.\n\nThe following scopes are currently supported:\n\ntime_data: Access activity history and summary time data or post offline time for the authorized user\n\ncategory_data: Access how much time the authorizing user spent in specific categories\n\nproductivity_data: Access how much time the authorizing user spent in different productivity levels\n\nalert_data: Access the authorizing user's alert history\n\nhighlight_data: Read from and post to the authorizing user's daily highlights list\n\nfocustime_data: Access the authorizing user's Focus Session history and session starting and stopping\n\nAPI Endpoints\n\nThere are several API endpoints that can be used to access different types of data within RescueTime.\n\nAnalytic Data API:\n\nThe Analytic Data API is targeted at bringing developers the prepared and pre-organized data structures already familiar through the reporting views of www.rescuetime.com.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Analytic Data API\n\nDaily Summary Feed API:\n\nThe Daily Summary Feed API provides a structured rollup of daily data about the time logged by a user. This data includes: total time logged, time logged at each productivity level, average productivity pulse, and the time spent in each major category.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Daily Summary Feed API\n\nAlerts Feed API:\n\nThe Alerts Feed API provides a feed of recent occurrences of user-defined alerts. It is a good way to let users define aspects of their data that they care about (“I want to spend more than 5 hours per day on All Productive Time”, for example) and then use that data in an external service.\n\nNote: Alerts are a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return empty results for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Alerts Feed API\n\nHighlights Feed API:\n\nThe Highlights Feed API provides a feed of recently entered daily highlights.\n\nNote: Highlights are a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return empty results for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Highlights Feed API\n\nHighlights POST API:\n\nThe Highlights POST API allows users to post a daily highlight entry programatically. An example use case is posting a new highlight whenever a software developer makes a new check-in to their GIT repository.\n\nNote: Highlights are a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return a 400 response for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Highlights Post API\n\nFocus Session Trigger API:\n\nThe Focus Session Trigger API allows users to start Focus Session on their active devices programatically.\n\nNote: Focus Session is a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return a 400 response for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Focus Session Trigger API\n\nFocus Session Feed API:\n\nThe Focus Session Feed API provides a feed of recent Focus Session \"started\" or Focus Session \"ended\" events. An example use case would be to set a chat application status to \"away\" when a new Focus Session started event has been detected.\n\nNote: Focus Sessions are a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return a 400 response for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Focus Session Feed API\n\nOffline Time POST API:\n\nThe Offline Time POST API allows users to post offline time to their account programmatically. An example use case would be to post offline time based on localtion data or meeting times.\n\nNote: Offline Time is a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return a 400 response for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Offline Time Post API\n\nDocumentation for the Analytic Data API\n\nRescueTime data is detailed and complicated. The Analytic Data API is targeted at bringing developers the prepared and pre-organized data structures already familiar through the reporting views of www.rescuetime.com. The data is read-only through the webservice, but you can perform any manipulations on the consumer side you want. Keep in mind this is a draft interface, and may change in the future. We do intend to version the interfaces though, so it is likely forward compatible.\n\nThe Analytic Data API allows for parameterized access, which means you can change the subject and scope of data, and is especially targeted for developer use. The data can be accessed via the HTTP Query interface in several formats.\n\nThe Analytic Data API is presented as a read-only resource accessed by simple GET HTTP queries. This provides maximum flexibility with minimal complexity; you can use the provided API tools, or just research the documented parameters and construct your own queries.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach this HTTP query API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key: https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/data\n\nFor Oauth2 connections:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/data - This is the least restritive url and requires the time_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRestricted Report: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/overview_data - This url will restricts the output to top level category data only and requires the category_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRestricted Report: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/category_data - This url will restricts the output to sub-category data only and requires the category_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRestricted Report: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/productivity_data - This url will restricts the output to productivity data only and requires the productivity_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nAbout restricted reports: Restricted reports may be useful if your application requires a less-granular rollup of the data, such as the category view, but NOT the actual activities themselves. These restricted reports help ensure the user’s privacy, and may be a preferable option when asking them to link their accounts.\n\nRequired parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nformat - [ 'csv' | 'json' ]\n\nQuery Parameters\n\nPrimary names are chosen for human reading. The short names are for when GET query length is at a premium. The alias is for understanding roughly how it maps into the language used in reporting views, and our own internal nicknames.\n\nPrinciple name Short Alias Short Values Description perspectivepvbyby [ 'rank' | 'interval' ]\n\nConsider this the X - axis of the returned data. It is what determines how your data is crunched serverside for ordered return.\n\nrank: (default) Organized around a calculated value, usually a sum like time spent.\n\ninterval: Organized around calendar time.\n\nresolution_timersintervali [ 'month' | 'week' | 'day' | 'hour' | 'minute' ]\n\nDefault is \"hour\". In an interval report, the X axis unit. In other words, data is summarizd into chunks of this size. \"minute\" will return data grouped into five-minute buckets, which is the most granular view available.\n\nrestrict_beginrb date\n\nSets the start day for data batch, inclusive (always at time 00:00, start hour/minute not supported)\n\nFormat ISO 8601 \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n\nrestrict_endre date\n\nSets the end day for data batch, inclusive (always at time 00:00, end hour/minute not supported)\n\nFormat ISO 8601 \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n\nrestrict_kindrktaxonomyty [ 'category' | 'activity' | 'productivity' | 'document' ]\n\n('efficiency' is option when perspective is 'interval')\n\nAllows you to preprocess data through different statistical engines. The perspective dictates the main grouping of the data, this provides different aspects of that main grouping.\n\noverview: sums statistics for all activities into their top level category\n\ncategory: sums statistics for all activities into their sub category\n\nactivity: sums statistics for individual applications / web sites / activities\n\nproductivity: productivity calculation\n\nefficiency: efficiency calculation (not applicable in \"rank\" perspective)\n\ndocument: sums statistics for individual documents and web pages\n\nrestrict_thingrttaxontx name (of category, activity, or overview)\n\nThe name of a specific overview, category, application or website. For websites, use the domain component only if it starts with \"www\", eg. \"www.nytimes.com\" would be \"nytimes.com\". The easiest way to see what name you should be using is to retrieve a list that contains the name you want, and inspect it for the exact names.\n\nrestrict_thingyrysub_taxontn name\n\nRefers to the specific \"document\" or \"activity\" we record for the currently active application, if supported. For example, the document name active when using Microsoft Word. Available for most major applications and web sites. Let us know if yours is not.\n\nrestrict_source_type [ 'computers' | 'mobile' | 'offline' ]\n\nAllows for querying by source device type.\n\nrestrict_schedule_id rsi schedule_id s id (integer id of user's schedule/time filter)\n\nAllows for filtering results by schedule.\n\nOutput Formats\n\nThe Analytic Data API supports CSV and JSON output.\n\ncsv - layout provides rows of comma separated data with a header for column names at top.\n\njson - returns a JavaScript ready object. It has these properties:\n\nnotes = String, a short explanation of the data envelope\n\nrow_headers = Array, a label for the contents of each index in a row, in the order they appear in row\n\nrows = Array X Array, an array of data rows, where each row is itself an array described by the row_headers\n\nExample Queries\n\nTo request information about the user's productivity levels, by hour, for the date of January 1, 2020:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/data?key=YOUR_API_KEY&perspective=interval&restrict_kind=productivity&interval=hour&restrict_begin=2020-01-01&restrict_end=2020-01-01&format=json\n\nTo request a list of time spent in each top level category, ranked by duration, for the date of January 1, 2020:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/data?key=YOUR_API_KEY&perspective=rank&restrict_kind=overview&restrict_begin=2020-01-01&restrict_end=2020-01-01&format=csv\n\nDocumentation for the Daily Summary Feed API\n\nThe Daily Summary Feed API provides a high level rollup of the the time a user has logged for a full 24 hour period (defined by the user’s selected time zone). This is useful for generating notifications that don’t need to be real-time and don’t require much granularity (for greater precision or more timely alerts, see the Alerts Feed API). This can be used to construct a customized daily progress report delivered via email. The summary can also be used to alert people to specific conditions. For example, if a user has more than 20% of their time labeled as ‘uncategorized’, that can be used to offer people a message to update their categorizations on the website.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The Daily Summary Feed is ‘point in time‘ data - use the data api or export CSVs from reports if you want your latest categorization results.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach this Daily Summary Feed API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key: https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/daily_summary_feed\n\nFor Oauth2 connections: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/daily_summary_feed\n\nRequired parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nOutput Format\n\nThe Daily Summary Feed API returns an array of JSON objects representing rollup information for each day logged by the user in the previous two weeks. It does not include the current day, and new summaries for the previous day are available at 12:01 am in the user’s local time zone. The returned value for each daily summary includes the following information:\n\nGeneral information\n\nid - Unix Timestamp representation of the date. Can use useful for deduplication of items in the feed.\n\ndate - Summary Date\n\nproductivity_pulse - Overall productivity pulse. A scale bewteen 0-100\n\nPercentage representation of time spent in different categories (Float with one decimal place.

This is a good event-based representation of data that the user cares about. Alerts are a premium feature and as such the API will always return zero results for users on the RescueTime Lite plan.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach the Alerts Feed API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key: https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/alerts_feed\n\nFor Oauth2 connections: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/alerts_feed - Requires the alert_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRequired parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nop - [ status | list ]\n\nThe op parameter determines what type of information about the alerts is returned. Passing op=list will return a definition list of all the alerts currently defined by the user. This is useful for presenting a list of the user's alerts to allow the user to select an alert_id value that will be used to filter subsequent queries.\n\nPassing op a value of status is the default, and will return a list of recently triggered alerts in reverse-chronological order.\n\nOptional parameters\n\nalert_id - [ Integer ID of an alert to filter on ]\n\nOutput Format\n\nWhen passing op=list, The Alerts Feed API will return an array of JSON objects representing the currently active alerts that the user has defined. Each alert object has the following structure:\n\n{\n\n'id': integer (Unique id of the user-defined alert, can be used for filtering the triggered alerts),\n\n'description': string (The string representation of the alert definition),\n\n'amount': float (the number of hours the user has defined for this alert’s threshold)\n\n}\n\nWhen passing op=status, the feed returns an array of JSON objects representing the actual triggering of alerts in reverse chronological order. Each object has the following structure:\n\n{\n\n'id': integer (Unique id for the occurence of the alert triggering),\n\n'alert_id': integer (Unique id of the user-defined alert, can be used to filter alerts),\n\n'description': string (The message generated by the triggered alert),\n\n'created_at': datetime (The time, in user’s selected time zone, that the alert was triggered)\n\n}\n\nExample Queries\n\nTo request a list of for the user's active alerts:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/alerts_feed?key=YOUR_API_KEY&op=list\n\nTo request a list of alert 12345 being triggered for the user:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/alerts_feed?key=YOUR_API_KEY&op=status&alert_id=12345\n\nDocumentation for the Highlights Feed API\n\nThe Highlights Feed API is a list of recently entered Daily Highlight events. These are user-entered strings that are meant to provide qualitative context for the automatically logged time about the user’s activities. It is often used to keep a log of “what got done today”. Highlights are a premium feature and as such the API will always return zero results for users on the RescueTime Lite plan.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach the Highlights Feed API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key: https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/highlights_feed\n\nFor Oauth2 connections: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/highlights_feed - Requires the highlight_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRequired parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nOutput Format\n\nThe Highlights Feed API returns an array of JSON objects representing the highlights that have been entered by a user. The returned value for each highlight has the following structure:\n\n{\n\n'id': integer (Unique id to trigger off of, useful for polling for new items),\n\n'description': string (The text of the highlight),\n\n'date': date (Date that the highlight was entered for, may be different than created_at),\n\n'created_at': datetime (Timestamp when the highlight was entered)\n\n}\n\nExample Queries\n\nTo request a list of for the user's recently entered daily highlights:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/highlights_feed?key=YOUR_API_KEY\n\nDocumentation for the FocusTime Feed API\n\nThe FocusTime Feed API is a running log of recently triggered started/ended FocusTime sessions. This is useful for performing 3rd party app interactions whenever a new FocusTime session has started/ended. FocusTime is a premium feature and as such the API will always return zero results for users on the RescueTime Lite plan.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach the FocusTime Feed API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/focustime_started_feed\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/focustime_ended_feed\n\nFor Oauth2 connections:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/focustime_started_feed\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/focustime_ended_feed\n\n- Requires the focustime_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRequired parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nOutput Format\n\nThe FocusTime Feed API returns an array of JSON objects representing the FocusTime started/ended events in reverse chronological order. Each object has the following structure:\n\n{\n\n'id': float (A UNIX timestamp that represents a unique id for the event),\n\n'duration': integer (The initial length of time in minutes for the FocusTime Session, focustime_started_feed only),\n\n'created_at': datetime (The time, in user’s selected time zone, that the session was started)\n\n}\n\nExample Queries\n\nTo request a list of recent FocusTime started Events:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/focustime_started_feed?key=YOUR_API_KEY\n\nDocumentation for the Offline Time POST API\n\nThe Offline Time Post API makes it possible to post offline time programmatically as an alternative to entering it manually on RescueTime.com. This is useful for capturing information from other systems. Examples include adding offline time after a meeting on a calendar app, or logging driving time based on location data.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach Offline Time POST API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key: https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/offline_time_post\n\nFor Oauth2 connections: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/offline_time_post - Requires the time_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nNote: A POST request must be used for this API. Also, offline time posts via the API are limited to a 4 hour maximum duration, and they can not be created for future dates.\n\nRequired QUERY parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nRequired JSON keys/values\n\nstart_time - A string representing the date/time the for the start of the offline time block. This should be in the format of ‘YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS’, but a unix timestamp is also acceptable.\n\nend_time/duration - Either a string representing the date/time the for the end of the offline time block, OR an integer representing the duration of the offline time block in minutes.\n\nactivity_name - A 255 character or shorter string containing the text that will be entered as the name of the activity (e.g. \"Meeting\", \"Driving\", \"Sleeping\", etc).\n\nOptional JSON keys/values\n\nactivity_details - A 255 character or shorter string containing the text that will be entered as the details of the named activity.\n\nOutput Format\n\nA successful post will return at status code of 200. If there is an error, a status code of 400 will be returned.\n\nExample Requests\n\nTo post offline time about a meeting that just ended:\n\nA POST request to the following URL:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/offline_time_post?key=YOUR_API_KEY\n\nwith a JSON body of:\n\n{\n\n\"start_time\": \"2020-01-01 09:00:00\",\n\n\"duration\": 60,\n\n\"activity_name\": \"Meeting\",\n\n\"activity_details\": \"Daily Planning\"\n\n}\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\nWhen you enable access to your data, you generate a key that is saved in RescueTime's system. Essentially, this key provides an alternative read-only authentication to your data. You can keep this key private, in which case it's just as safe as your login and password, or publish it, without exposing your account to other access or risks beyond the scope of the data.\n\nWe assume data api access is being requested for use on the server side of things, presumably in some code of your own. In this case, you can protect the key as you would any other server side secret. It would never be seen in the browser, but used by your application to retrieve data from us then process and render yourself somehow. So in this case, the key provides read-only access to your data by arbitrary scope (within limits) through parameters.\n\nAs a user, you can revoke access to keys you have created by going to your Key Management Page. Any applications you have connected to via an Oauth2 connection, can be revoked by going to your connected applications page.",
      "# [Account Information](https://www.rescuetime.com/rtx/signup)\n1. ACCEPTANCE\n\nRescueTime provides its service (”Service”) to you, subject to the following Terms of Service (”TOS”). The TOS tell you what you can expect from the Service, and what RescueTime expects of you. RescueTime may amend the TOS at any time by posting an amended TOS on our website.\n\n2. REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS\n\nYou must register for a membership in order to access the Service. When completing the registration form, you will provide true, accurate, and complete information, and maintain and promptly update this information. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, or incomplete, or RescueTime has reasonable grounds to suspect that the information is untrue, inaccurate, or incomplete, RescueTime has the right to suspend or terminate your membership and access to the Service. You are responsible for obtaining access to the Service, which access may involve third party fees (such as Internet service provider charges). In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the Service. You will enter a password and login name during the registration process. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and login name, and are responsible for all activities that occur with your password and login name, including fees incurred and all purchases made by your membership on the Service. This means that, unless your password and login name, or credit card information is obtained unlawfully or fraudulently, you will be responsible for all fees incurred and purchases made by your membership. You will immediately notify RescueTime of any unauthorized use of your membership or any other breach of security.\n\n3. MEMBERSHIP, FEES\n\nIndividuals may obtain a membership with the Service without paying a fee. RescueTime will charge fees to access certain components of the Service. If you must pay a fee to access a component of the Service, this information will be posted by RescueTime on the Service. You may use a credit card to pay these fees. When you use a credit card for payment, you represent to RescueTime that you are the authorized card holder. For recurring fees, RescueTime will charge your credit card each month. For one-time fees, RescueTime will charge your credit card once. RescueTime reserves the right to change its fees or billing methods. If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your membership, but RescueTime will not refund any fees that may have accrued to your membership before you cancel it. RescueTime may also charge you for any sales or use taxes to which the Service is subject.\n\n4. PROHIBITED USES\n\nYou agree that you will not:\n\nimpersonate any person, including a RescueTime employee or agent on the Service; violate any local, state, or national law through or on the Service; harass people through or on the Service; collect or store data about other people using the Service; use any device, software or routine to interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Service; take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on the infrastructure of the Service; use the Service in any manner other than as expressly authorized in the TOS; reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, or exploit for any commercial purposes, any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service.\n\n5. OWNERSHIP AND RESTRICTIONS\n\nThe license granted in these TOS does not constitute a transfer or sale of RescueTime’s ownership rights in the RescueTime Database. RescueTime retains all right, title, and interest in and to the RescueTime Database including all related intellectual property rights. You will use your best efforts to prevent and protect the contents of the RescueTime Database from unauthorized use or distribution. You must not rent, lease, sublicense, sell, assign, loan, distribute, transmit, or otherwise transfer any content of the service, including the RescueTime Database, or your rights and obligations pursuant to the TOS. You must not copy, reproduce, alter, modify, create derivative works, or publicly display any content of the Service, including the RescueTime Database, unless expressly authorized in the TOS.\n\n6. CHILDREN\n\nBy registering, installing, and accepting these TOS you represent to RescueTime that you are at least 13 years old. RescueTime’s policy is to prohibit children under the age of 13 from purchasing, accessing, registering, or using any of RescueTime’s products and services unless under the guidance, supervision and consent of their parents, guardians and/or authorized school officials. We rely on parents and guardians to ensure minors only use RescueTime products and services if they can understand their rights and responsibilities as stated in this TOS and our Privacy Policy.\n\nFor teachers or parents, if you want children under the age of 13 to create their own RescueTime accounts, then you (or your school) assume the responsibility for complying with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and, to the extent applicable, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”). This means you must notify childrens’ parents/guardians of the information to be collected and obtain parental/guardian consent before collecting and sharing with the RescueTime products and services the personal information of children under the age of 13 in order to establish an account or use the RescueTime products and service. Teachers may, under appropriate, circumstances provide such consent on behalf of parents/guardians. For more information on complying with COPPA, see the Federal Trade Commission’s website at http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm.\n\n7. RescueTime PRIVACY POLICY\n\nCertain registration information and other information about you may be collected by RescueTime and through the Service. RescueTime’s use of this information is governed by the RescueTime Privacy Policy.\n\n8. USER WARRANTY\n\nYou represent and warrant to RescueTime: (a) that you have full power, authority, and legal capacity to enter into the Agreements and follow its obligations, and if you are registering on behalf of a company or other entity, you have the authority to bind your principal or employer company; (b) you will provide complete and accurate information to RescueTime; and (c) you will pay all charges that you incur at RescueTime’s then-current rates.\n\n9. INDEMNITY\n\nYou will indemnify and hold RescueTime, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your use of the Service, your violation of the TOS, or your violation of any rights of a third party.\n\n10.

You understand and agree that the cancellation of your membership or a particular component of the Service is your sole right and remedy with respect to any dispute with RescueTime. This includes, but is not limited to, any dispute related to or arising out of: (a) any term of the TOS or RescueTime’s enforcement or application of the TOS; (b) any policy or practice of RescueTime, including the Privacy Policy, or RescueTime’s enforcement or application of these policies; (c) the data available through the Service; (d) your ability to access and use the Service; or (e) the amount or type of fees, surcharges, applicable taxes, and any RescueTime billing methods. RescueTime, in its sole discretion, may terminate your membership and remove and discard any of your Recommendations without notice if RescueTime believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the TOS. RescueTime will not be liable to you for termination of your membership to the Service. Sections 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16, and 17 will survive the termination of the TOS and your membership.\n\n12.

RescueTime has no control over these sites and is not responsible for their availability, does not endorse them, and is not responsible or liable for any content, goods, or services available from these sites.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL RescueTime’S TOTAL LIABILITY OF ALL KINDS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTY CLAIMS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORUM AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY ACTION OR CLAIM IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT OF FEES PAID BY YOU TO RescueTime IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACTION GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY, AND (B) $100. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THE TOS. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n15. TRADEMARK INFORMATION\n\nRescueTime, the RescueTime logo, and other RescueTime logos, products and service names are trademarks of RescueTime. You must not display or use them in any manner.\n\n16. ARBITRATION\n\nAny legal controversy or legal claim arising out of or relating to the TOS or the Service, excluding legal action taken by RescueTime to collect fees or recover damages for, or obtain an injunction relating to, RescueTime’s intellectual property or the Service, will be settled by binding and final arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any controversy or claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis, and will not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. The arbitration will be conducted in King County, Washington, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered into any court having jurisdiction. Either you or RescueTime may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in King County, Washington necessary to protect the rights or property of you or RescueTime pending the completion of arbitration. Should either party file an action contrary to this provision, the other party may recover attorney’s fees and costs up to $1000.00.\n\n17.

You consent to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in King County, Washington. The failure of RescueTime to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS will not constitute a waiver of the right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found to be invalid, the other provisions of the TOS will remain in full force and effect. Any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.",

      "# [RescueTime](https://community.rescuetime.com/faq)\nThis is a Civilized Place for Public Discussion\n\nPlease treat this discussion forum with the same respect you would a public park. We, too, are a shared community resource — a place to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing conversation.\n\nThese are not hard and fast rules. They are guidelines to aid the human judgment of our community and keep this a kind, friendly place for civilized public discourse.\n\nImprove the Discussion\n\nHelp us make this a great place for discussion by always adding something positive to the discussion, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.\n\nOne way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening. Spend time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you’ll have a better chance of meeting others who share your interests.\n\nThe topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.\n\nBe Agreeable, Even When You Disagree\n\nYou may wish to respond by disagreeing. That’s fine. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Please avoid:\n\nName-calling\n\nAd hominem attacks\n\nResponding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content\n\nKnee-jerk contradiction\n\nInstead, provide thoughtful insights that improve the conversation.\n\nYour Participation Counts\n\nThe conversations we have here set the tone for every new arrival. Help us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an interesting place to be — and avoiding those that do not.\n\nDiscourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, watching, muting and so forth. Use these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else’s, too.\n\nLet’s leave our community better than we found it.\n\nIf You See a Problem, Flag It\n\nModerators have special authority; they are responsible for this forum. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.\n\nWhen you see bad behavior, don’t reply. Replying encourages bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. Just flag it. If enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.\n\nIn order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts; the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.\n\nAlways Be Civil\n\nNothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:\n\nBe civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.\n\nKeep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.\n\nRespect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.\n\nRespect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.\n\nThese are not concrete terms with precise definitions — avoid even the appearance of any of these things. If you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of a major news site.\n\nThis is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.\n\nKeep It Tidy\n\nMake the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up. So:\n\nDon’t start a topic in the wrong category; please read the category definitions.\n\nDon’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.\n\nDon’t post no-content replies.\n\nDon’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.\n\nDon’t sign your posts — every post has your profile information attached to it.\n\nRather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button. Rather than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction, use Reply as a Linked Topic.\n\nPost Only Your Own Stuff\n\nYou may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission. You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone’s intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.\n\nPowered by You\n\nThis site is operated by your friendly local staff and you, the community. If you have any further questions about how things should work here, open a new topic in the site feedback category and let’s discuss!

The application keeps track of which window is \"in focus\" when you are on your computer, and logs what activity you are doing and for how long you are doing it.

Then I make my tasks and log my time against those tasks.\n\n## Comment ID chy4y3z with +2 score by [(Aristox, Reddit, 2014-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/276ymu/alternative_to_rescuetime/chy4y3z/) (in reply to ID 276ymu):\nHave you considered [ManicTime](http://www.manictime.com/)?\n\n### Comment ID ic49daq with +2 score by [(Kaley_White, Reddit, 2022-06-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/276ymu/alternative_to_rescuetime/ic49daq/) (in reply to ID chy4y3z):\nUnfortunately, ManicTime is not free.\n\n#### Comment ID iihp2bn with +2 score by [(TejaMaeHunMarkIdharH, Reddit, 2022-08-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/276ymu/alternative_to_rescuetime/iihp2bn/) (in reply to ID ic49daq):\nhttps://activitywatch.net/\n\n#### Comment ID ic4vzco with +1 score by [(Aristox, Reddit, 2022-06-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/276ymu/alternative_to_rescuetime/ic4vzco/) (in reply to ID ic49daq):\nIt was when I posted that comment lol\n\n## Comment ID clffdi5 with +1 score by [(surferkinggood, Reddit, 2014-10-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/276ymu/alternative_to_rescuetime/clffdi5/) (in reply to ID 276ymu):\nThis one seem to be free: http://www.timeedition.com/en/downloads/index.html\n\nThis one seems to be a good contender to RescueTime: https://www.timecamp.com\n\n## Comment ID chyfdfw with +1 score by [(rsmith14, Reddit, 2014-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/276ymu/alternative_to_rescuetime/chyfdfw/) (in reply to ID 276ymu):\n[Omnicontext Personal Analytics]( http://www.omnicontext.org/) is a time-tracking Windows app like Rescuetime that does real-time tracking of web browsing, application use, calendar events, etc.  There's a Windows Phone/Android version you can install on your smartphone to track your mobility via GPS and accelerometer measurements, which should allow you to track your time with textbooks away from the computer.

      "# Post ID 1g5vqmz: RescueTime, are you okay? with +4 score by [(FiveDigitLP, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RescueTime/comments/1g5vqmz/rescuetime_are_you_okay/)\nIs it just me, or does RescueTime seem off here lately? I worry that the company may be in a downward spiral.\n\nPerhaps I'm just paranoid or it's just my design-inclined brain, but there's just little signs that make me wonder if they're trying to cut costs and at the same time improve revenue where they can. They've merged old RT in with the new and called it \"time analytics\", but didn't do anything to improve the old stuff or even simply make it look like the new UI--same with the old goals and alerts which was a huge headache for me since all of my old alerts started popping up even though they were no longer relevant.\n\nLikewise, the new design of the blog feels half-baked. Some of the new layout is kind of reflective of new design trends, but most of it feels quite antiquated and there's quite a few places with a lack of padding so that elements feel lacking in polish. There have also clearly been some articles being republished, or at least they're putting a spotlight on old ones in the emails.\n\nAnyway, I don't have any conclusive evidence. There are just several things that have me concerned about the future of this product.\n\n## Comment ID lss78t1 with +4 score by [(rt_jp, Reddit, 2024-10-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RescueTime/comments/1g5vqmz/rescuetime_are_you_okay/lss78t1/) (in reply to ID 1g5vqmz):\nAppreciate the check-in... all good over here!  To (hopefully) ease your concerns, I am going to paste a (slightly modified) reply I sent to a recent question on our community page.  As you will see, there's a reason for some of the UX inconsistencies, but we are working to unify those into a much more modern experience.  \n\nRe: the \"cut costs / improve revenue where they can\" - unlike most SaaS companies, our pricing has remained unchanged (not to mention we added a major new feature - Timesheets - and included it in the existing plan for no additional cost). Any more on why you are feeling that way? \n\nThanks for being a part of the community - if you have any suggestions or features you think would be valuable, drop them here or on our community page.  We always appreciate the feedback and hearing the interesting ways people are using RescueTime. \n\nJP @ RescueTime \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe’ve had two major priorities in 2024:\n\n**Completing the Major Development Milestones for Timesheets**  \nAfter releasing Timesheets in beta last year, we focused on several significant improvements, including:\n\n- Adding a Client-Project-Task hierarchy\n\n- Building a reporting interface\n\n-Adding team management and reporting\n\n- Integrating Timesheets projects with Focus Sessions\n\n- Enhancing the auto-suggestion feature\n\n- Improving usability (e.g., day finalization, comment support, hiding/unhiding timeline activities, etc.)\n\nMost of these are complete or nearing completion.  Timesheets was a major release for us and we have heard a lot of positive feedback about how much it helps solve a truly miserable problem - having to track project time.    \n\n**Unifying the RescueTime Experience**  \nAs we discussed before, in 2021, we released a new version of RescueTime to simplify the user experience. While there were many positive changes, especially on the technical/design side, we heard from users that some key features of the traditional experience were missing, like advanced reporting and data trends. In 2024, we started to combine the best aspects of the traditional RescueTime with the modern version (desktop assistant, universal Focus Sessions, modern web experience). So far, in 2024 we have:\n\n- Opened up the traditional Time Analytics dashboard and reports for newer RescueTime users (accessible via the mode menu next to the logo)\n\n- Built a new Goals and Alerts interface, including the addition of Timesheet project goals\n\n- Updated the Windows desktop assistant for better handling of closing and minimizing\n\n- Fixed the desktop assistant issues related to unnecessary sounds\n\n- Improved the cross-device Focus Session experience, so starting a Focus Session on desktop will block apps on iOS\n\n- Updated our logo \n\nAnd coming soon…\n\n- Modernizing the design and UX of the traditional RescueTime elements (note, we are planning to release these as we finish them, so things may look a little inconsistent from a UX perspective until the work is complete).  \n\n- Streamlining the Focus Session start process into a single screen in the desktop assistant\n\n\n\nOur team remains super motivated and working hard every day to enhance your experience. We’re committed to helping our community stay protected from the constant distractions and focus on the work that matters.\n\nExpect a more formal update with these details and future roadmap plans to hit your inbox soon.\n\n### Comment ID lugoahw with +1 score by [(FiveDigitLP, Reddit, 2024-10-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RescueTime/comments/1g5vqmz/rescuetime_are_you_okay/lugoahw/) (in reply to ID lss78t1):\nThanks for your thorough response, JP!\n\nI did not consider that RescueTime’s pricing has remained the same for so long. You definitely bring up a valid point and I recognize how rare that is! As a user for several years, thank you for that!\n\nI agree that the features you mentioned in your original post are important. As my employer has been asking us to keep track of our project time more, I have found Timesheets to definitely be invaluable for me when I forget to start a timer!\n\nPersonally, the “newer” assistant still feels rough around the edges. Maybe I need to check for an update, though, because I still feel like I have some weird issues with closing and minimizing. Also, sometimes it feels like the alerts can be delayed. I will be doing distracting activities, but sometimes by the time the alert pops up I’ve already moved onto something else. I don’t know what can be done about this since I know that there is going to be some inherent delay if the assistant has to communicate back and forth with the server; likewise, I’m wondering if this issue might be exacerbated when I’m doing distracting activities on my phone.\n\nBack to the cost cutting point, at the time when I wrote this there were several aspects of the blog that when combined gave me the impression that there was a lack of care and polish with that facet of the company. In particular, there was a guest post that appeared to be republished. I don’t have an inherent problem with this, but most, if not all, of the links in the post no longer worked. I’d say this was the catalyst for me writing this post on Reddit. I have been frustrated with little things here and there with RT for a little while now, but trying to read a post and not being able to actually take action on the information it was providing brought everything to a head for me, I suppose.\n\nAnyway, thank you again for taking the time to respond. I did not expect anyone from RescueTime to actually reply. I was just venting and was interested to see if any other users were noticing something similar.\n\n## Comment ID lsguneg with +1 score by [(raider708-, Reddit, 2024-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RescueTime/comments/1g5vqmz/rescuetime_are_you_okay/lsguneg/) (in reply to ID 1g5vqmz):\nI’m completely new to rescue time, but i just subscribed to their 2 week trial based on the timesheets feature, which seems simple and perfect for a freelancer like me.

It allows categorization by grouping activities, which makes it useful to differentiate useful tasks vs. \"waste\".\n\n### Comment ID iuubolk with +2 score by [(glithch, Reddit, 2022-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/yjt1wh/time_tracking_apps/iuubolk/) (in reply to ID iuqip4m):\ni wish there was an app like this. so far this seems to be the only thing with feature op described\n\n#### Comment ID kuzaonh with +6 score by [(disastermood, Reddit, 2024-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/yjt1wh/time_tracking_apps/kuzaonh/) (in reply to ID iuubolk):\nI'm a year late but I'm just gonna leave this here to anyone who finds it. \"SaveMyTime\" on Android does exactly that.\n\n#### Comment ID jxtuf03 with +1 score by [(ajoijo, Reddit, 2023-08-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/yjt1wh/time_tracking_apps/jxtuf03/) (in reply to ID iuubolk):\nhave you found some app like this?

      "# [Team Reports on 2024-06-20](https://help.rescuetime.com/article/35-team-reports)\nIn addition to the individual Premium reports accessible by each member of your team, RescueTime for Teams provides special team reports. The group reports in RescueTime for Teams will help your team members visualize their cumulative time and understand how they are working together as a group. These reports include rollup statistics about how time was spent in different categories at different times of the day or week. If Key Tools are configured, your team can also see how much time they spend using specific tools.\n\nGroup reports are accessible by everyone on the team\n\nThe reports are a tool for the entire group to see how they are working as a team. As such, they are available to all members. It lets individuals see benchmarks of team norms, and helps them understand their place in the group.\n\nTime-tracking systems within an organization often raise questions by those being tracked. Team members may worry about being \"spied on\". The best ways to address any concerns is to show potential team members what data is available in the reports and to remind them that RescueTime is not designed to be employee monitoring software. It is both a tool to help managers make smart choices about the overall team time-management strategy and a source of valuable information for the individuals on the team.\n\nIndividual data is not accessible in the group reports\n\nThe group reports only contain anonymized, aggregated information about how the team as a whole is spending its time. A manager cannot view an individual's private details or activities. Group time is aggregated, and in most cases rolled up to the category level. Key Tools are the only activities that will be displayed explicitly in team reports. This helps ensure the privacy of your team members and cuts down on a lot of noise that would make your reports less oriented toward the goal of increasing productivity as a team.\n\nAccessing Team Settings\n\nTeam settings are found in the drop down menu under the Tools icon:\n\nAccessing the group reports\n\nYou can access the group reports by clicking Reports in the top navigation, and choose Your Team:\n\nSummary Report\n\nThe summary report gives a high-level overview of how your team is spending its time. You will be able to see the total time logged for the team, the time by day, top categories and key tools, and a breakdown of patterns throughout the day. You can adjust the date and time frame using the date controls at the top of the page. You can also view time by day, week, month, or year.\n\nCategories Report\n\nThe categories report shows a detailed analysis of how time is spent across different categories. For the selected period you can see the total time in each category as well as a breakdown of how that time was spent during particular hours, days or weeks.\n\nKey Tools Report\n\nThe Key Tools report shows a detailed breakdown of how time is spent in the different key tools you have configured. For the selected period, you can see the total time in each key tool as well as a breakdown of how that time was spent across hours, days, or weeks. You can configure your key tools on the Tracking Settings page: https://www.rescuetime.com/sponsors/tracking_settings\n\nPlease note: As owner or administrator, you would set up the categories for the Key Tool activities for your team. However, your team member can change this category in their own reports. This will not alter the team reports. Suppose your team member decides to change a category in their own reports. In that case, this time will still be accounted for and applied to the category you originally set for the Key Tool activity and therefore be included in the team reports.\n\nDid this answer your question?

      "# [Honest RescueTime Review by a Competitor by Jibble.io on 2023-12-09](https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime)\nBy Asim Qureshi, CEO Jibble\n\nAs a CEO of a time tracking software company I need to know what my competitors are up to. That means my team and I are often researching about and/or playing around with their products, you know, it’s part of the job. Here, I share my findings of that research, giving credit to those competitors where credit is due and being honest about which products I believe you really need to avoid. And so, there you have it, this review, and in it, I try to be honest, fair, and insightful. I hope it helps you make the right decision…\n\nThis Review Covers:\n\nOverview\n\nWhat Do Users Like About RescueTime?\n\nWhat Don’t Users Like About RescueTime?\n\nWhat Pricing Plans Does RescueTime Offer?\n\nWhat are the Standout Features of RescueTime?\n\nSelected Positive User Feedback\n\nSelected Negative User Feedback\n\nWhat are RescueTime’s Review Ratings from Review Sites?\n\nWhat’s My Final Verdict on RescueTime?\n\nOverview\n\nRescueTime is an award-winning software marketed as a productivity assistant that records computer and device usage habits. It touts time tracking combined with intuitive analysis of activities that don’t require any manual input from users.\n\nRescueTime automatically tracks time and activities from a user’s device. The data gathered by the software is organized into reports that detail how the time has been used on sites visited, files opened, and the apps and programs used the entire day.\n\nMy favorite feature is called FocusTime, which blocks all the websites classified by the user as personal or distracting, guarding your digital workspace from social media, entertainment, and other things that might creep up unnoticed, stealing time away from the things that matter.\n\nWhile the software does work well as a time tracking and activity analysis software, it lacks some very important features commonly present in other software marketed as productivity assistants.\n\nRescueTime does not offer workforce management tools such as cost calculation, invoicing, geolocation, and other features that limit its use to mostly personal goal-chasing. While it is a valuable productivity enhancement tool, it is not a work management and productivity solution for freelancers and businesses who need more than just the analytics that RescueTime provides.\n\nAside from these limitations, RescueTime doesn’t do quite well on mobile. Users have encountered bugs that have led to loss of tracked data, or the app simply doesn’t work and data doesn’t get tracked.\n\nWhat Do Users Like About RescueTime?\n\nAutomatic and unobtrusive tracking\n\nExcellent productivity analysis\n\nGreat for reducing distractions\n\nFind more on what users love about RescueTime.\n\nWhat Don't Users Like about RescueTime?\n\nMobile app needs some improvement\n\nUI needs improvements\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\nFind more on what users hate about RescueTime.\n\nWhat Pricing Plans Does RescueTime Offer?\n\nRescueTime has two plan variants: RescueTime Lite and RescueTime Premium.\n\nLite\n\nRescueTime Lite is free and is intended to cover the basics of time management and analysis.\n\nWith this plan, users get a personalized daily Focus Work goal, real-time tracking of daily goals and access to yesterday’s results, weekly reports of activities, goals and distractions, and timely alerts to improve habits.\n\nPremium\n\nRescueTime Premium is a paid plan that costs $12 monthly or $78 annually.\n\nWith this plan, users get all RescueTime Lite features, plus Focus sessions to block distractions, calendar integrations to schedule Focus Sessions, one-click entry into meetings, meeting tracking, morning outlook with Focus Zone forecasting, history reports with date controls and spreadsheet export, and weekly and monthly progress tracking.\n\nIf we compare RescueTime Premium’s price to similar software with project management and other administration capabilities at similar price points, I can’t help but feel that they are charging so much for so little.\n\nRead 5 things you MUST know about RescueTime’s pricing.\n\nWhat are the Standout Features of RescueTime?\n\n1. FocusTime\n\nFocusTime blocks out websites that the user has pre-defined as Personal or Distractions for a duration of time set by the user. You can start a FocusTime session by selecting the Get Focused option from the desktop app, accessed by clicking on the RescueTime icon on the menu bar or system tray.\n\nYou can also start FocusTime through calendar events, where it will start automatically at the time the entry is set. Users can set up an automatic Focus Session, by having it automatically start when you have spent a user-set amount of time on personal activities.\n\nDuring FocusTime when you go to a website you listed as Personal or a Distraction, you’ll be met with a FocusTime block page. You can choose to continue to the site, rescore it to Other Work, or continue to focus.\n\nWhen a user enters into a Focus Session, all their devices connected to their RescueTime account will automatically be in focus session as well.\n\n2. Comprehensive Activity Tracking\n\nRescueTime automatically tracks all computer activity 12 to 24 hours after it is installed. It doesn’t require users to clock in or switch tasks on a dashboard every time something new is being started, except during Focus Sessions.\n\nWorking in the background, RescueTime records every website and application users open or use during user-determined periods of tracking. It can be configured to collect full window titles, document titles, and URLs for more transparent activity monitoring.\n\nUsers also have the option to specify which sites and programs should be tracked via a whitelist on the Monitoring Options page. This means that site-specific data from whitelisted sites are recorded as usual, but activities on non-whitelisted sites are recorded merely as general browsing.\n\nThe Goals feature encourages users to help improve their habits by analyzing tracked data and creating actionable plans from it. Focus Work Goals take into consideration their meeting schedules and personal information to create — and meet — realistic milestones.\n\n3. Productivity Pulse\n\nRescueTime’s Productivity Pulse is a productivity meter that calculates the score across a time period on a donut graph that displays productivity points out of a hundred a user accumulates according to their time usage.\n\nThe score is calculated as the time-weighted average of the five different categories of activities previously discussed, ranging from Focus Work Time to Distracting Time.\n\nThis feature provides an easily understandable representation of time utilization and is helpful when users need to quickly check their productivity score or to keep track of progress and set up scores to beat. Having a number to surpass is a cool way of motivating users to do better; RescueTime’s Productivity Pulse provides just the challenge to keep them on fire.\n\nSelected Positive User Feedback:\n\n“Its the best app which helps me to set goals and also in time tracking. It has the feature of automatic time tracking which helps us to understand the hours we worked.” – Verified User in Accounting (Source G2)\n\n“One of the most useful aspects of RescueTime is its ability to automatically track the time I spend on different apps and websites without the need for manual intervention. This helps me get an accurate and objective picture of my work day without extra effort, the biggest time savings I have is with these features.” – Verified Reviewer (Source Capterra)\n\n“This tool for our team has been an eye-opening tool for tracking and improving productivity. Its automatic time tracking feature helps users understand how they spend their time on the computer and mobile devices..” – Fernando L. (Source Capterra)\n\n“The best thing about RescueTime is how after setup you simply forget about it. It works 100% without interaction and at the end of each day you have a comprehensive report on all the activities you performed.” – Lucas P. (Source Capterra)\n\n“The ease of use is the best of that tool. Without having to remember to start a task or something, it silently records what you are doing in the background.” – Christian H. (Source Capterra)\n\nSelected Negative User Feedback:\n\n“Can’t use with 2fa, which is insane. RescueTime carries sensitive data that tracks everything I do, so I’m incredulous that they don’t provide the barest of protections for that data.” – T.D.

The data gathered from tracking activities across periods are organized into user-defined categories that rank them on a five-point scale of productivity, from very productive to very distracting.\n\nThis allows users to reflect on their time utilization and adjust their practices as needed. Over time, RescueTime helps users build healthy productivity habits.Having said that, I would like to clarify that RescueTime is not a replacement for traditional project management tools, as it lacks many important features that other similar time tracking software provide for similar pricing.\n\nIt does not have any shift scheduling capabilities, billing and invoicing features, project progress tracking tools, and accountability safeguards, among others. And while it does provide very detailed analytics, too many numbers and report variants may just prove to be too much for users looking for simpler and to-the-point reporting.\n\nOther issues that caught my attention are the usual bugs, glitches, and crashes, some very much-needed tweaking in the mobile apps to address less-than-desirable mobile experiences, and stronger assurances that users’ privacy would not be compromised by its all-encompassing activity tracking.\n\nTo sum it all up, I’d say that you should definitely get RescueTime if you want to really understand where your time goes, and want to become more productive and develop a healthier work-life balance but don’t know where to begin.\n\nBut if you are looking for a more capable and traditional time tracking and project management tool, look elsewhere as RescueTime is not that.",
      "# [Monitoring Options on 2024-05-31](https://help.rescuetime.com/article/45-monitoring-options)\nRescueTime offers a wide variety of monitoring options, which can be accessed by navigating to the Privacy page under Account Settings > Data & Privacy\n\nLogging Details\n\nYou can choose whether RescueTime collects full window titles and document information for applications as well as choose the activity details for email programs.\n\nOnly Monitor Specific Websites\n\nBy default, RescueTime monitors all websites and all applications that you use.\n\nTo monitor only specific websites you would toggle the Monitor all websites option off and then click on the Manage Whitelist link.\n\nYou can choose to limit which sites are monitored. This \"whitelist\" will be pushed to your computer, effectively telling the data collector on your machine to submit all websites on this list as normal, but record all NON-whitelisted websites as generic browser time. This offers complete privacy for sites not on the list. RescueTime simply never receives any site-specific data for non-whitelisted sites.\n\nIgnore Activities\n\nRescueTime also allows you to ignore specific applications selectively. We strongly discourage this, as it can skew data dramatically. However, this feature can be used for virtual machine applications like VMWare (where you can ignore VMWare and choose to install RescueTime on the virtual machine).\n\nYou can ignore an activity from your Apps & Websites Report. We share details on how to ignore apps and websites here.\n\nYou can manage your ignored activities from your Data & Privacy page.\n\nLogging Schedule\n\nYou can specify which days and times of the week you want to monitor your activities. You can enable RescueTime to monitor your activities all day.\n\nIf you choose to define days and times, then toggle the 24 x 7 option off and click on the Manage Logging Schedule link.\n\nRescueTime will record events only during the days and times you selected. Outside of those hours, you'll notice that the RescueTime icon is grayed out.",
      "# [RescueTime Review to Create Timesheets in 2024 by Engineering Team on 2024-02-23](https://clickup.com/blog/rescuetime-review/)\nTime is the only resource you can’t make more of. Streamlining your to-do list can certainly help, but when you’re sending out a time management SOS, you need a tool like RescueTime to throw you a life preserver.\n\nTime-tracking software is a must-have for true productivity, and that’s where RescueTime comes in. It functions as a time tracker and timesheet tool with a dose of structure, insight, and helpful but pesky reminders to keep you on track. 🏃\n\nLike any productivity tool, RescueTime has its pros and cons. If you aren’t sure whether it’s worth your time (see what we did there?), check out this RescueTime app review. We’ll explain how RescueTime works, its pros, cons, and pricing. Plus, we’ll share a great alternative to RescueTime if you decide it’s not your thing. Let’s get to it!\n\nWhat Is RescueTime?\n\nRescueTime is a time-tracking tool designed to help you master time management. Sure, it tracks your time, but this all-in-one productivity tool does more than that. It provides comprehensive insights into how you spend your time.\n\nWhether you’re a freelancer who needs to create accurate timesheets or a team leader who needs to boost productivity levels, RescueTime offers the insights you need to set and meet goals. 🏅\n\nThe tool runs quietly in the background on your computer or mobile device, whether it’s Windows, Mac, iOS, or Android, gathering data on your activity. It then compiles this data into detailed reports and graphs showcasing your most productive times, distracting websites, and how you distributed work hours between tasks.\n\nRescueTime is different than other productivity and time-tracking tools because it gives you a productivity score (which it calls the productivity pulse). This score measures how efficiently you use your time. You can also set goals for your focus time and block distractions to stay in the zone.\n\nKey RescueTime Features\n\nThere’s a lot to love about RescueTime. Compared to competitors like Toggl and Clockify, it offers a more robust way to track your time and improve time management. Optimize your work hours and say bye-bye to distractions with RescueTime’s time-saving features.\n\n1. Focus Sessions\n\nRescueTime’s main feature is Focus Session, a Pomodoro-like work sesh where you set aside a block of time for focused work. The goal is to get into a mental flow state by mono-tasking, which is the key to real productivity. 🧠\n\nWe like that RescueTime doesn’t just throw you into a Focus Session. Their setup wizard takes you through a helpful prep session that includes a body check-in, reminding you to go to the bathroom or grab water. RescueTime also asks you to go through a quick mental reset, take a deep breath, and commit to your Focus Session before you click the “start” button.\n\nUsers say they like the prep checklist and the Focus Sessions themselves. You’re free to customize the session however you see fit. For example, RescueTime integrates with Spotify to personalize the experience without opening another app.\n\nAlso, every Focus Session tells you how many other workers are in Focus Sessions worldwide in real time. Body doubling, or feeling more motivated when someone works alongside you (in person or virtually), helps you get even more out of these Focus Sessions.\n\n2. RescueTime Assistant and AI (beta)\n\nAll RescueTime accounts come with an Assistant, which gives you a customized morning forecast of the day’s meetings and to-dos. Not only that, but the RescueTime Assistant also looks at your schedule and tells you the best time for focused work in between meetings and events. 🔎\n\nThis feature is still in beta, but RescueTime is also rolling out an AI-powered assistant. Currently available only for timesheets, the AI automatically divides time between projects and clients, improving the accuracy of your time-tracking. However, the AI needs a lot of data to do this for you, so set aside plenty of time to train the model.\n\n3. Distraction alerts and blocking\n\nHow often have you sat down intending to work, only to find yourself scrolling through Instagram? It happens to the best of us. 🙈\n\nSometimes, you need to take care of business, and in a world where distractions are just a tap away, you need to take more extreme measures.\n\nWhat sets RescueTime apart from other time-tracking apps is its ability to block distractions. Tell it which apps or websites are your Kryptonite, and it will block them during every Focus Session.\n\nIf you “forget” and try to access distracting websites anyway, you’ll get a pop-up from RescueTime displaying your timer, time management goals, and a healthy guilt trip to remind you to return to work. 👀\n\n4. RescueTime community sessions\n\nRescueTime is a wiz at implementing body doubling. For extra motivation, join one of its community Focus Sessions. These are Pomodoro-style one-hour or two-hour Focus Sessions happening live worldwide.\n\nIf you don’t want to join the all-hands-on-deck RescueTime sessions, you can always create a shared space with coworkers, colleagues, or strangers while you work. This tricks your brain into thinking other people are holding you accountable and working alongside you, which works wonders for productivity.\n\n5. Time metrics\n\nAwareness is a great time management technique. At the end of every Focus Session, RescueTime will send you detailed reports and graphs illustrating your productivity pulse.\n\nThese reports break down your activities into categories such as “very productive,” “productive,” and “distracting,” allowing you to see where your time is going at a glance. RescueTime will even rank your distractions so you can pinpoint the culprits more quickly. 📌\n\nRescueTime Pricing\n\nFree version\n\nMonthly: $12/month\n\nAnnually: $6.50/month, billed annually for $78\n\nPros of Using RescueTime\n\nChoosing RescueTime as your go-to time-tracking tool comes with plenty of benefits. While RescueTime might not be right for everyone, loyal fans love the app for several reasons.\n\nImproved self-awareness\n\nRescueTime’s metrics, notifications, and distraction reminders make you more aware of your daily routine. Its detailed reports clarify how you spend time, making it easier to identify bad habits and spot opportunities for improvement. It might sting a little to get a slap on the wrist for goofing off when you’re supposed to be working, but it’s all for the sake of boosting your productivity.\n\nFewer distractions\n\nOther time management tools might say, “Hey, you’re distracted!” However, RescueTime takes things a step further by literally blocking distractions. 🛑\n\nIt blocks distracting websites and apps during your designated focus time so you can preserve concentration. This feature is heaven-sent for anyone easily sidetracked by social media and other online distractions, ensuring you give your undivided attention to the most important tasks.\n\nAutomation\n\nRescueTime also has an automatic time-tracking feature that eliminates manual time entries, boosting the accuracy of your timesheets. That’s particularly helpful for freelancers who must provide precise time reports to clients or teams needing to track project management progress.\n\nGoal-setting\n\nRescueTime differs from other solutions because it allows you to set and achieve goals in record time. Set goals for your productive time and get alerts to stay on track. It’s fully customizable, too, so you’re free to make the platform your own.\n\nSmart integrations\n\nRescueTime eliminates the headaches of hopping back and forth between solutions, tools, and platforms. Integrate it with Slack, your calendar, or other project management software to streamline your workflow.\n\nCommon Pain Points RescueTime Users Face\n\nAs much as folks love RescueTime, it has a few setbacks. Users commonly mention these pain points.\n\nLots and lots of data\n\nRescueTime can initially seem overwhelming. It generates impressive data about your habits, but it takes time to make sense of the detailed reports. Like any platform, new users frequently complain about RescueTime’s learning curve. Take time to familiarize yourself with the dashboard and reports and learn how to interpret your metrics correctly. 📈\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\nRescueTime tracks everything you do across all of your tracked devices. Some users rightfully worry about privacy, especially regarding tracking features like screenshots or detailed logs of the websites they visit. RescueTime has robust privacy policies for data governance, but you need to give up some privacy to get the full benefit of the platform.\n\nLimited free features\n\nThe free version of RescueTime doesn’t have the advanced features you’ll get in RescueTime Premium. You won’t have as much freedom to customize goals, block distractions, or generate in-depth reports, which can be a drawback for anyone on a budget. 💸\n\nSyncing issues\n\nYou’ll probably see syncing issues using RescueTime across multiple devices, like your desktop and phone. There are occasional delays or inconsistencies between the desktop and mobile apps, which could give you an inaccurate picture of your productivity.\n\nRescueTime Reviews on Reddit\n\nWhat do the people of the internet really think about RescueTime? We took to Reddit to weigh the good, the bad, and the ugly of this productivity tool.\n\nSome users say RescueTime does a great job, but several had issues with the price of RescueTime Premium ($78 annually). They also mentioned they didn’t think the premium version was much better than the free version.\n\nOther users noticed RescueTime had some pretty big time-tracking discrepancies. “ActivityWatch tracked 17m; Rescuetime said I spent only 8 minutes, which is wrong by a margin. Also, note that they haven’t made significant changes to the Windows app since 2020/05/19. Like WHAT?” one user said.\n\nSome folks said the free version worked just fine, while others liked the premium features but not the premium price. Many users mentioned switching to RescueTime alternatives because of tracking discrepancies and out-of-date apps.\n\nRescueTime has much going for it, but it isn’t the be-all, end-all. This time log tool lacks many features, so you’ll likely still be flipping between different tools to do your work.\n\nEnter ClickUp, an alternative productivity and work management platform that offers time tracking, project management, and much more. 🎯\n\nSmart project time tracking\n\nHow much time do you spend on each project, task, or client? You’ll never know for sure without ClickUp project time tracking.\n\nThis project time-tracking features allow you to track time, create estimates, add notes, and more. Whether it’s the free Chrome extension, mobile app, or desktop site, you get an accurate view of your work in a single report. 📝\n\nSpeaking of reports, ClickUpTime Tracking cards are perfect for monitoring timesheets, estimates, billing, and more. Build a custom dashboard with Time Tracking cards of your choice to get a high-level view of your most important productivity metrics in one place.\n\nSolid time management\n\nTime tracking is one thing—time management is another beast entirely. That’s why ClickUp also includes tools for time management and goal-setting. Add time estimates to any task or split time between team members to manage expectations and keep your team on task.\n\nIf you’re a visual worker, ClickUp also has something for that. Toggle between Calendar view, Gantt view, Timeline view, or Workload view for a bird’s-eye look at what’s on your plate. 🤩\n\nTime-saving templates\n\nHey, do you know what RescueTime doesn’t have? Templates.\n\nGuess what ClickUp has? Templates by the pound!\n\nYou’re in the driver’s seat with ClickUp. Pull a template and customize it to meet your team’s time-tracking needs. For example, the ClickUp Services Timesheet Template allows team members to track work hours weekly. ⏳\n\nMoreover, the ClickUp Time Management Schedule Template is helpful for organizing your schedule and examining how you spend time.\n\nClickUp pricing\n\nFree Forever\n\nUnlimited: $7/month per user\n\nBusiness: $12/month per user\n\nEnterprise: Contact for pricing\n\nClickUp Brain: Available on all paid plans for $5/Workspace member/month\n\nSimplify Activity Tracking With ClickUp\n\nWe could all do with some extra time. But you can’t create more time, which is why maximizing your time at work is so important. The RescueTime app is a popular solution for time-strapped professionals, but it still requires hopping from platform to platform to do your actual work.\n\nClickUp is a true all-in-one solution for tracking both connected and offline time.

      "# [The 5 best time tracking apps in 2025 by Kiera Abbamonte on 2018-09-17](https://zapier.com/blog/best-time-tracking-apps/)\nIf you spent an hour working on a client project, but no timer was around to track it, did you even do any work? (That's how that saying goes, right?)\n\nAs a freelancer, I'm responsible for every aspect of my business, from client work to marketing to record-keeping and admin. I keep detailed records of how long every business task and client project takes me, which helps me price my services accurately and avoid overbooking my schedule. But whether you're a solopreneur like me or a 9-5 office worker, knowing how you spend your time gives you crucial insight into—and control over—where you spend your energy.\n\nTime tracking apps make it easier to record billable hours, streamline your business processes, and improve your personal productivity. The best time trackers have built-in timers but also let you edit or add time manually. Some of these apps even incorporate AI for a hands-off tracking process, so you can focus on deep work and leave the analytics for later.\n\nAfter several weeks of in-depth testing, I've rounded up the best time tracking apps for individuals and teams so you can choose the app and features that match your work style best.\n\nThe best time tracking apps\n\nToggl Track for a free time tracking app\n\nMemtime for simple automated time tracking\n\nTrackingTime for visualizing time differently\n\nTimeular for automated time tracking\n\nHarvest for ease of use without sacrificing features\n\nWhat makes the best time tracking software?\n\nWhen you know how you spend your time, you can analyze your work trends and make smarter business decisions. Whether you're working solo or in a small team, time tracking software can give you a complete overview of your daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly work.\n\nWhat do you do with this information? Perhaps most importantly, project time tracking can help you get paid, allowing you to feel confident about your invoices rather than trying to estimate how much time you worked after the fact. If you're part of a team, time tracking can help you answer the question, \"What have you been working on this month?\"\n\nWhen evaluating the best time tracking apps, I considered the following criteria:\n\nReal-time tracking. Nearly all time tracking apps let you track in real time, meaning they give you a running clock that you launch when you start a task, and that you can pause or stop when you finish.\n\nThe ability to edit time tracked or manually add time blocks. The best apps let you correct time tracked after the fact, such as if you accidentally leave a timer running while you take off for lunch. You should be able to edit the time log to subtract however many minutes you weren't working. You also want an app that lets you enter a block of time post hoc in case you forget to launch a timer at all. For example, if your phone rings and you jump into a 20-minute consulting call, you might not start a timer, but you do want to log and bill for those hours worked.\n\nReporting features. The most powerful time tracking apps offer dashboards and reports that let you break out daily, weekly, or monthly time spent per project, per person, or per client.\n\nThe ability to create an invoice or export data. Once you aggregate all your time spent on your work, you have to be able to take action on it. All these apps let you either automatically create invoices from the time tracking data stored in the app or export that information into PDFs, CSVs, or Google Sheets to share with the right people.\n\nMultiple points of access. The best time tracking tools make starting a timer easy and convenient. They have the versatility to let you start a timer from wherever is most convenient to you, whether that's your browser, a desktop app, or your mobile device.\n\nBonus: AI features. Artificial intelligence is automating and simplifying workflows across tools of all industries, and time tracking apps are no exception. I gave special consideration to time trackers that use AI to auto-track your time or use machine learning to automatically assign time blocks to related tasks and projects.\n\nWhat's not included in this roundup\n\nHere, I focused specifically on finding a time tracker for freelancers, individuals, and small teams. I didn't consider employee monitoring software, which often includes some type of time tracking. I did include two automated tracking tools that monitor users' activities—but the data is for each user's eyes only. With these tools, you choose how much (if any) data to share with your supervisors. If you're looking for more team-focused apps, take a look at Zapier's picks for the best free timesheet software.\n\nAdditionally, I haven't included project management, invoicing, or accounting apps that come with an add-on or built-in time tracker. While time-tracking clocks can be very helpful inside these tools, I assume if that's what you need, you're likely shopping for a more robust solution.\n\nThe best time tracking apps at a glance\n\nBest free time tracking app\n\nToggl Track (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, Web, and browser extensions)\n\nToggl Track pros:\n\nGenerous free plan\n\nEffortless real-time tracking\n\nNumerous access points\n\nToggl Track cons:\n\nNo task management or planning features on free plan\n\nIf you need a time tracker tool but can't pay for one, you should use Toggl Track. The time tracking tool has a generous free tier of service that gives you access to all its apps (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, Web, and browser extensions) and includes all the core functionality you'd expect in a time tracking app.\n\nToggl Track works so effortlessly primarily because it doesn't ask much of you when you start timing a task. With many time tracking apps, you have to have a client, project, and task entered into your account before the app will let you track time. If you don't, you have to set your task aside for the time being and enter them. With Toggl Track, you can track your time right away, view your tracked time entries in a grid or calendar format, and worry about the details later.\n\nAdditionally, when you use Toggl Track through the Chrome or Firefox browser extension, a Toggl timer button shows up in just about every web app you could imagine, from Google Docs (and other Google apps) to Help Scout. Because you always see the Toggl Track button while you're working, you have a continual reminder to track your time. I also like keeping the desktop app open on my computer, so even if I start a timer from my browser window, the running clock will appear on my Mac's menubar. The easy accessibility from wherever I am makes Toggl's timer one of the most flexible and easiest-to-use tools I've tested.\n\nToggl Track also has some of the most detailed options I've seen in a time tracking app. For example, in the Toggl Track Chrome extension, you can automatically start and stop tracking time based on whether the browser is open or not. It also has excellent idle detection, which helps you maintain high accuracy across your records. When the app detects your computer has been idle but a timer is still running, it offers ways to correct the recorded block of time. That way, if you're interrupted while working and get sucked into a 20-minute conversation, Toggl Track can knock out those 20 minutes from your record. Toggl Track even has a Pomodoro Technique setting, so that you can work for a set amount of time on a project that requires your focus and then take a short break, all with simple stopwatch-like reminders.\n\nToggl has also recently upgraded its dashboards and reporting features for even more in-depth data analysis. You can create customized dashboards to see weekly stats or team summaries, and then generate reports filtered by team, tag, or client.\n\nFor even more flexibility, use Toggl Track's Zapier integrations to connect Toggl Track with your favorite apps, so you can start new time entries in Toggl Track when calendar events start, add new entries to a spreadsheet, and more. Learn more about how to automate Toggl Track, or get started with one of these pre-made workflows.\n\nToggl Track pricing: Free for up to 5 users; $9/user/month when billed annually for the Starter plan, which includes time rounding, billable rates, saved reports, and more.\n\nBest time tracking app for simplified auto-tracking\n\nMemtime (macOS, Windows, Linux)\n\nMemtime pros:\n\nSeamless automatic tracking\n\nSimple feature-set\n\nMemtime cons:\n\nDesktop-only\n\nPrivacy concerns with AI tracking\n\nMemtime (formerly timeBro) is a relatively new automated time tracking tool that has quickly become my new favorite. Much like Timely, Memtime is a desktop app that keeps track of your computer activity, so you can categorize it later. No more remembering to start or stop a timer; just visit the app at the end of your workday to review and categorize what you've done.\n\nWhat I love so much about Memtime is its simplicity. The other auto-tracking tools I tested have so much emphasis on team project management and timesheet creation that it's easy to become overwhelmed. If, like me, you're not collaborating on projects with others or planning to submit detailed timesheets to your supervisor, tools like Timely might be overkill. Memtime's interface is much more minimalist, with a running log of your activity, a space where you can create entries with a click, and an overview of your day's work. There's also a page for project management—where you can add clients and projects manually or import them from your other apps—and a reporting page with your productivity stats. You can also sync Memtime with your calendar to view events alongside captured activities.\n\nTo create new time entries in the Timeline view, it's easy to click on the timeline and drag your cursor to adjust the entry's duration. The display is broken down into five-minute intervals (or you can choose a one-minute breakdown if you prefer to be more granular and don't mind scrolling). Alternatively, you can use List view, which lets you drag and drop activities to log new entries.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that Memtime only works in a desktop app; no mobile app or web access. And since Memtime uses five-minute intervals by default in the Timeline view, I found the total logged work time to be less precise than Timely. But since I'm just tracking for my personal use, the simplicity of Memtime is worth the sacrifice.\n\nIf you're looking to dip your toe into automated time tracking but don't want to be overwhelmed with team or project management features, I absolutely recommend trying Memtime.\n\nMemtime pricing: $12/user/month (with a 24-month subscription) for the Basic plan, which comes with fully automated time tracking and calendar sync. The Connect plan starts at $18/user/month for project management software integration.\n\nBest time tracking app for visualizing time differently\n\nTrackingTime (Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Web, Chrome, Firefox)\n\nTrackingTime pros:\n\nGreat for time blocking and planning\n\nStraightforward interface\n\nBuilt-in project management feature\n\nTrackingTime cons:\n\nFree plan limited on features\n\nMay be too simple for some use cases\n\nTrackingTime is a collaborative time tracking tool that looks different from many other time tracking apps. It represents time in blocks or windows, just as if that working time were an event on your calendar. It's not the only app that lays out your time in this fashion, but it does offer the most opportunities for customization. For example, you can choose between a day, week, month, or team view.\n\nThe daily view has the most helpful layout I've seen, showing the full month's calendar on the left (with each day displaying an icon to show the amount of time tracked) and the day you select on the right, color-coded and organized by blocks of tracked time.\n\nTrackingTime also puts more emphasis on planning your time before you start working compared to other apps. For example, you can schedule blocks of time on your calendar for tasks you intend to work on later in the week or for recurring events, like meetings —it's almost like a combo time-tracking and time-blocking app.\n\nThe Work tab is the closest to a traditional project management tool that I've seen, with a sleek and user-friendly interface. It looks similar to an Asana list, where you can view tasks broken down by project, client, priority, or date. Clicking on a task expands a side panel where you can view tracked time, add attachments or subtasks, and set custom fields. If you're looking for a time tracker that doubles as a relatively robust task manager, TrackingTime is worth checking out.\n\nIf you'd rather keep your task manager separate, TrackingTime's Chrome extension integrates with several productivity tools, allowing you to start a timer directly from apps like Airtable, Asana, and Notion. Or you can connect TrackingTime to Zapier to help it talk to all the other apps you use. Here are a couple examples to get you started.\n\nTrackingTime pricing: Free for up to 3 users; $5.75/user/month (minimum 3 users) for the Pro plan for unlimited collaboration, advanced reporting, and team management features.\n\nBest time tracking app for automated time tracking\n\nTimeular (Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Web, Linux)\n\nTimeular pros:\n\nSeamless automatic tracking\n\nBuilt with privacy in mind\n\nOffline tracker available\n\nTimeular cons:\n\nNo free plan\n\nThe best time trackers offer features that save you time, not add to your workload. They make it seamless to record your time and add details quickly, whenever it's convenient. That's the promise of most time tracking apps—Timeular is one of the few that actually lives up to it.\n\nTimeular's automatic tracking is still in beta, but in my experience testing the app, it's the most seamless auto-tracking I've come across. My favorite way to view time is the Day view, where the app interface is set up in three columns: activities on the left, tracked time in the middle, and auto-tracked activity on the right. You can add this automatic data into your official tracked time log with as few as two clicks.\n\nIn the Activities column, every activity you've previously logged is listed. It takes one click on the play button next to any given activity to start the timer. In the left-hand menu, select Insights to view in-depth reports on how you're spending your time or Budgets to set and track detailed time budgets by client or project.\n\nYou can use Timeular via web, mobile, or desktop apps. It's one of the few apps I tested with a pretty consistent feature-set across each access point, but you'll need the desktop or mobile app to activate automatic tracking—and all that data is stored locally on your device, where it's private and secure.\n\nAnother unique feature of Timeular is the option to purchase a separate physical tracker. The tracker looks like an eight-sided die, which you can program to correlate with eight different activities, including offline work. Simply flip to the side of your choice, and the timer starts tracking and automatically syncs with the Timeular app.\n\nYou can do even more when you connect Timeular with Zapier, automating workflows like updating your Slack status, logging time across apps, and more. Here are a few workflows to get you started.\n\nTimeular pricing: From $7.50/user/month for the Personal plan, which includes unlimited automatic time tracking and standard features.\n\nBest simple time tracking app with lots of extras\n\nHarvest (Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Web, and browser extensions)\n\nHarvest pros:\n\nSuper simple time tracking flow\n\nNative invoicing and project management\n\nExtensive third-party integrations\n\nHarvest cons:\n\nSuper limited free plan\n\nIf you're looking for a dead simple solution to track your time, Harvest is a strong contender. The user experience is simple, but the app certainly isn't lacking in features.\n\nYour timesheet is the main screen you'll see when you log in. From there, it takes one click on the green plus sign to add time. Simply choose a project and category from the dropdown menus, and then either add time you've already worked or hit Start timer. Once tracked, time entries are displayed in a list on your timesheet.\n\nHarvest offers its own native invoicing, expense tracking, and project management features. Creating an invoice from tracked time is super quick, and Harvest offers similarly simple, yet in-depth, reports to track time logs, uninvoiced work, and profitability by client, project, team member, and task category.\n\nThe app even includes a Client Dashboard module, which you can enable or disable from the Settings screen. When enabled, it generates a unique URL you can share with clients to allow them to view all of their invoices and payments.\n\nHarvest offers a ton of integrations with third-party project managers, invoicing and payment software, communication tools, and more. Plus, you can automate tons of workflows when you connect Harvest with Zapier. Learn more about how to automate Harvest, or get started with one of these pre-made workflows.\n\nHarvest pricing: Free for 1 user and up to 2 projects; from $11/user/month for the Pro plan to get unlimited users and projects, team reporting, accounting and payment integrations, and more.\n\nWhat makes the best time tracker?\n\nThe right time tracking app takes the guesswork out of scheduling and accounting for your workday. Easily start and stop timers, add or edit time entries manually, and export or review your data for more accurate invoicing and planning. And you can save even more of your valuable time by automating the data flow between your other apps and your time tracker of choice. That way, you're spending your time where it matters most.\n\nRelated reading:\n\nThe best meeting schedulers\n\nThe best AI scheduling assistants\n\nThe best time blocking apps\n\nTimesheet templates to help you track your time",

      "# [RescueTime: Dive into Efficiency [with RescueTime vs Everhour] by black-and-white films on 2024-06-02](https://everhour.com/blog/rescuetime-vs-everhour-examining-the-two/)\nMany organizations now apply the best time tracking practices to monitor employee activity and measure team performance to improve business operations. Thanks to time tracking tools, such as RescueTime, monitoring and improving productivity has never been easier. This article will shed light on RescueTime – its main features, pricing, pros & cons, tips and tricks, and compare two popular tools to determine which time tracker will be on top: RescueTime vs Everhour.\n\nWhat Is RescueTime?\n\nWe’ll begin by exploring RescueTime. The tool was created to tackle some of the problems present in the modern workplace, namely, stress, reduced productivity, and burnout. One of the best ways to improve your productivity is to understand how you spend your time, so you can make necessary adjustments. RescueTime tracks your activity on a computer or mobile device and then provides you with insights into how you spend your time.\n\nRescueTime Features\n\nRescue time provides users with a variety of useful features, which we’ll explore in more detail.\n\n🚜 Activity tracking\n\nOne of RescueTime’s best features is its activity-tracking feature. It lets users see exactly what their team members have been doing each day. The feature tracks the time a user spends on a particular website, app, or even a specific document, allowing management to review their team members’ working habits and make adjustments if necessary.\n\n🔖 Activity labeling\n\nOnce RescueTime has collected the necessary data about how you use your time, it will categorize it into how productive it is on a scale with five different productivity levels. Some websites may be deemed as distracting in some roles and productive in others. For example, scrolling through your company’s news website is part of your job if you’re a journalist. As a result, you can mark certain websites as productive rather than distracting.\n\n❗ Work goals and distraction blockers\n\nRescueTime enables you to set a personal daily work goal and allows you to block distractions when necessary during what the platform calls a ‘focus session’. The app tracks what you’re working on and will alert you when you’re beginning to lose focus or trying to work on too many tasks at one time.\n\n📊 Dashboard\n\nThis data is then presented on a dashboard. It gives you a productivity pulse and measures your productivity compared to the previous day. Additionally, the dashboard presents your activities by color: blue being productive, grey as neither productive nor distracted, and red as distracted. Finally, a table of each hour that you’ve worked that day will be populated with the color corresponding to the activity you did during that time.\n\nOnce you’ve used the app for a while, it will give you more detailed insights into how you use your time. For example, if you use the app for a couple of months, you may find that you’re particularly productive on certain days.\n\n📃 Reporting\n\nThe data recorded in the dashboard can be converted into a report, which you can download and share with whoever you like by emailing them a copy within the platform. With a premium subscription, users can view a wealth of information in reports. This includes:\n\n– Detailed activity reporting\n\n– Trends within your activity to show how you work overtime\n\n– A breakdown of your activities by an input source\n\n– The ability to view your data based on customized time filters\n\n– Exporting your data to CSV and filtering data based on specific keywords\n\n🔏 Privacy\n\nRescueTime allows you to disable the platform for certain apps and websites, giving you control over what information is recorded. You can pause the RescueTime app at any time. The app allows you to pause all RescueTime activity for 15 minutes, an hour, or until tomorrow to give you privacy.\n\nPlus, you can schedule the app to only record your activity at certain times of day, outside of these times, the app will not track your activity. That’s not all—you can also restrict which websites RescueTime logs by creating a white list of websites you would like RescueTime to track.\n\n🔁 Integrations\n\nYou can allow other apps to use your RescueTime data. The app can be integrated with several platforms, including but not limited to\n\nThese integrations enable you to get the most out of the platform. You can also export reports to a CSV file, but only if you have a premium subscription.\n\n🔧 Support and platforms\n\nRescueTime offers various support options if you encounter problems. The first port of call is the RescueTime knowledge base, where you’ll find informative articles about the platform, troubleshooting information, and FAQs. Suppose these pages do not help you fix a problem. In that case, you can contact the RescueTime team on the company website using the contact form, leave a phone message or email the team at contact@rescuetime.com.\n\nRescueTime is a web-based platform, but it also has a mobile app that lets you track mobile phone usage. The RescueTime app is available on Android and IOS.\n\n💲 Pricing\n\nRescueTime offers a free version of the app with limited features. The RescueTime premium plan, which includes all the outlined features, costs $6.50 a month per user when billed yearly.\n\n❓ Alternatives\n\nRescueTime is a great app if your main goal is to track your productivity. However, it does not offer the same billing and invoicing features as other time tracking and productivity apps on the market. If you’re looking for an alternative app to increase your productivity, consider Todoist.\n\nThe app is used by millions of people to plan and collaborate on projects of all sizes. You can write to-do lists, create labels, set priority levels to highlight your most pressing tasks, set reminders, highlight favorites, and delegate tasks to team members. Additionally, you can see tangible progress through productivity visualizations, which, by week and month, help you stay on track to achieve set goals.\n\n✅❌ Pros and cons of RescueTime\n\nWhy users might be looking for a RescueTime alternative?\n\nWhile RescueTime is fully functional and can take care of most of your needs, it’s worth taking a look at some of the drawbacks users might encounter when using it.\n\n1️⃣ Occasionally, it can be challenging to allocate a recorded activity to a specific project, particularly when managing multiple concurrent projects that require the same tools.\n\nEverhour simplifies the process of allocating recorded activities to specific projects, even when managing numerous concurrent projects with similar tool requirements.

      "# [Show HN: Rem: Remember Everything (open source)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38787892)\nThis does look cool. It reminds me of a recent discovery I made. The other day, while trying to recover some disk space, I found a giant file on my hard disk. It turned out to be a nine-hour screen recording from almost a year ago. I had no idea it existed, so I must’ve accidentally left the screen recording on. Scrubbing through it sped up, watching the whole thing in a couple minutes, was fascinating; it was like a window into my thought process at that time. You could see how I was researching something online. It was almost like a play-by-play, akin to re-watching a sports performance – very instructive and surprisingly useful.\n\nAlso, the the sense of being back in that time seeing details that I otherwise probably would’ve forgotten was transformative.\n\nIn a similar vein to what you’ve done, but focusing specifically on web browsing, I’ve created a tool called ‘DownloadNet.’ It archives for offline use and fully indexes every page you visit. Additionally, it can be configured to archive only the pages you bookmark, offering another mode of operation. It’s an open-source tool, so feel free to check it out: https://github.com/dosyago/DownloadNet\n\nthanks for checking it out, sure: some of the ways people are using it follow below.\n\n- reverse-proxy to protect proprietary code on your website from being inspected\n\n- content accelerator (similar to mightyapp's original idea) where it's faster to render pages on a cloud vps with thick bandwidth than it is on a local device (in some cases at least!), and depending on the usage profile, it's even cheaper to serve that bandwidth, especially if you use additional video codecs.\n\n- a framework to deliver web data collection and automation, agent authoring and intervention tooling on any device with no download\n\n- cors-proxy to include and access content across domains for building design and test tools saas\n\n- co-browsing for customer training and demonstration\n\nand then there's the many cybersecurity and privacy ways including:\n\n- standard remote browser isolation to isolate your device from zero day threats (an extra couple layers, requiring an even longer exploit chain, of protection, at least)\n\n- to aid compliance and privacy by preventing insider data exfiltration in both directions when dealing with sensitive data (by blocking file transfer, copy paste, etc)\n\nadmittedly it's diverse, and hard make generalizations about customers.\n\none way i think is cool that i haven't seen yet (but want to get around to doing myself!) is a way to deliver \"browser extensions\" without needing either: 1) a compatible browser on your device, 2) the extension to come from a store, 3) any local download. In some sense it's safer as the extension does not run locally, but in other ways it's more dangerous as there's no central store. But it's very cool to explore, and what we really need for that is a great \"developer API\" that can expose a \"browser extensions\"-like layer.\n\nOne cool thing is that ad-blocking extensions built on BrowserBox will not be limited by the current restrictions that extensions developers face on existing platforms. The aim is to provide a powerful instrumentation api as simply as possible.\n\nthank you for your question :)\n\nbtw - 42matters looks great! love your site design, really fantastic look. analytics is surely lucrative, i knew a similarly focused company also bearing the name 42 i'm sure. somewhere before anyway (but surely it had a different origin!). is 42 indicative of something special in analytics?\n\nLong time ago, I did sth similar, i.e. made a screenshot every few seconds, with the purpose to automatically extract information from it, e.g. how long I was using some app.\n\nI wrote a PNG DB to split PNG images into many blocks and have each block stored in a DB. If there are several equal blocks, it is only stored once. Via a hash table, the lookup for such blocks is made fast. With this PNG DB, I have a compression rate of about 400-500%. https://github.com/albertz/png-db\n\nSome of the scripts I used to analyze the screenshots are here, but in the end, it was not really so successful and reliable: https://github.com/albertz/screenshooting\n\nIn the end, that lead to another project, where I just was storing that information more directly, i.e. what application was in the foreground, what file was open. https://github.com/albertz/timecapture\n\n> like if I see C# or Python it makes sense to me at least in some way\n\nCould it be that you're just more used to looking at C#/Python than other things, then other things are more foreign and therefor look messy?\n\nAs another anecdote, I cannot stand browsing/looking through C# code as it tends to be filled with various classes just to basically write very basic programs. The amount of over-engineering I've seen in C# surpasses everything else I've looked at. Not to mention how people seem to arbitrary chose between private/public with no real consensus on when to use what, everything seems to be encapsulated in the wrong way. And don't get me started on the infrastructure around it, csproj vs sln and dealing with dependencies/assemblies.\n\nBut then I mostly write Clojure code day-to-day, and I realize that my troubles for dealing with C# is mostly because of what I'm used to, not because the language itself is inherently shit. I only have myself to blame for this. I'm sure people who write C# day-to-day have the same feelings about Clojure as I have about C#.\n\nCopying text from the saved footage is wild!\n\nI had a poor man's version of this with TimeSnapper Classic, a free Windows utility that takes a screenshot every n seconds then lets you view a timelapse at the end of the day to show how you spent your time.\n\nAfter a few weeks my disk was starting to fill up with screenshots. I browsed the folders and noticed that most of the screenshots looked almost identical. \"I should come up with some kind of image codec optimized for image sequences, that diffs against the previous image to save space.\" Then realized I had basically reinvented GIF / video codec haha. So I wrote a script to shove the timestamp (filename) into the image itself (with ImageMagick), and convert them to video with ffmpeg. 99.9% size reduction!\n\nThis looks a lot more useful though.\n\nAbout Remember Everything\n\nI use singleFile ( browser extension) - saves a copy of every webpage I view on Chrome and FireFox. I use a program AutomaticScreenshotter to record my screen activity to capture other non browser activity. Enables me to work what I was doing on my PC at any past date. All files are saved in a Year/month/day dir structure. Finding stuff - use windows search at present.\n\nI also use ditto to save all copy and pastes in a mysqldb.\n\nI've been doing this since before 2010 ( the dir structure) THe extensions and screengrabs , only started that about 3-4 years ago.\n\nI've often wonder if forensic PC investigation tools would /could also be used ( my with some mods to help produce a PC timeline of my activity.\n\nCongrats on getting this off the ground, and thank you for putting it out there for us to learn from!\n\nI've been curious how Rewind worked under the hood because I've been playing with an idea in my head: an AI assistant that helps you protect your attention.\n\nYou would describe the kind of content that you consider a distraction, and any other constraints you have (e.g. \"Don't let me watch cat videos unless I'm on a break\".\n\nAnd whenever it sees you watching anything that fits your prompt, it'll pop up on the screen and start a conversation with you to try and understand whether you actually need to consume the content you're looking at.\n\nAn AI that intervenes when you're going off track (based purely on how YOU define going off track). Current website blocking approaches aren't useful because they're all-or-nothing. I don't ever want to block entire sites because often there's useful content there relevant for my work. I want to block content on a much more granular level.\n\nAnd I'd love for an \"attention audit\" at the end of each day. Attention is our most valuable asset, and I believe protecting it is a worthwhile endeavor... I'd just like some help doing so :).\n\nGenuinely so pleased with this! I'm a big fan of Rewind as a concept because, in general, I write down everything I do every day (helps with my poor memory, adhd, and in general), and a tool that can record my online-actions and facilitate search too is a game-changer for me (specially when it doesn't come with the hefty price tag).\n\nCouple things -- 1) Do you ever plan on introducing shortcuts to toggle rem as opposed to using the menu-bar option?\n\n2) What's storage like? Will rem's size keep getting larger and larger until I purge all? Or will I eventually get to select how long I want to 'remember' something (without manually having to 'start' and 'stop')?\n\n3) One bug I've caught a few times is - once I toggle timeline and just slide back to view previous 'memories', >50% of the time my device won't let me exit out of the 'timeline' and I'll have to exit out of rem (cmd+opt+esc) and re-open it.\n\nBut all in all, very happy with this!\n\nVery cool demo OP. Not sure why it's only for Apple Silicone, is it because of it's superior ML support compared to windows? Side oservarion, Olama is not available for Windows. Sadly I won't be able to test this out since I don't own a Apple Silicon notebook, I only have a Apple Intel and beefy Windows.\n\nI don't know if I am a basic programmer or lack the idea on how do folks go build something like this from scratch with no Swift programming language. If I was OP, I would first do bunch of Swift tutorials.\n\nThis will be wishful thinking but it is a legitimate side project to make a clone of this to work on Linx oe WIndows on programming language I am most comfortable in, Java and C#. I have zero background in building anything in ML and not at all familiar with Direct X api or Linux Desktop API or Direct X.\n\nThe point I am trying to make is there is crap ton of API and tools to be familiar with before even taking the step to code.\n\nHow did OP crack this with no exp in Swift to build this? Is it simplar to build project on Apple Silicon and I should get one?\n\nMind you, I have 4 YOE and code in Java and C# doing vanilla web API and bit of WinFoem/DevExpress work.\n\nI have been in software for a while now. I just love learning and doing cool stuff.\n\nAs for being able to hack in Swift specifically... I'm comfortable in 5-6 languages, and play with many more. The language itself feels like a mix of C# and Kotlin to me. But I had no familiarity with Mac OS APIs or SwiftUI / MVVM etc. but there's lots of docs, despite them having effectively no examples.\n\nThe repo has a lot of room to grow in terms of quality, which is perfectly ok in my book.\n\nRe: Apple Silicon - I should have just said \"I built it on my laptop which is an M1 Air and it's managing to keep up with the screenshot -> OCR -> ffmpeg rendering pipeline and not completely drain the battery and have a strong suspicion it will require a lot more work to get it to perform the same on Intel computers\"\n\nAs for clone it and build it in Linux / Windows - do it. And there are other comments here suggesting others want to do the same.\n\nI personally want this thing, if I can impact speed of it happening positively, awesome.\n\nI want to record everything and have this nice big dataset which is what I've experienced (on my laptop) the last X amount of time, and be able to do stuff with it - whether it's chat with a local llm or have a really good way to search back in time. I _constantly_ need things from the past.\n\nSurprisingly this is something that I have been thinking on for the whole 2023.\n\nI myself am really bad at documenting findings while doing research or bugfixing so I started at recording all my daily activities for both replaying research sessions and also for my future me in case something is not clear in the docs.\n\nThen I knew rewind and I was happy to know that I am not alone. This REM is the confirmation that this definitely has great use cases :)\n\nI’d rather prefer the recording phase to be as lightweight as possible so I am recording the full mp4 video and plan to re-encode at a lower rate at night. But there is a compromise between recording quality and file size, I do not want end up with several Petabytes of videos.\n\nWhat codec do you recommend for this use case? Lossy video codecs usually are very efficient for real images (just like the comparison between jpg/png) and I am sure a video format that is PNG based should be more efficient in space while preserving text quality.\n\nI am very interested in read your thoughts about this.",
      "# [RescueTime](https://www.softwareadvice.co.uk/software/75198/rescuetime)\nPros\n\nEasy to understand tracked data on the dashboard. Visual charts are impactful & very helpful. It can be quite surprising to see how much time I can waste & also how much good time I have put into my work & projects including when I seem to be most creative/productive. Also it's great that it can track my activity across my devices eg my laptop & my phone to give a better picture of how I am using/losing my time.\n\nCons\n\nI dislike the fact that you can't really customize things without lots of tedium in the categories and other areas. Also, the ability to change tracked sections of the day or week are somewhat limited; there are only one or two generic filters for declaring which days and hours to run the tracking. I have noticed that the categories are geared mostly toward organizations more than individuals. I have realized that if I customize categories to make a certain activity productive time instead of distracted time, it won't let me change just that one activity to be productive without bringing the entire category along with it.\n\nPros\n\nEven though it is not a time tracker in the sense of providing info to clients, I've chosen RescueTime over all other time management software. Why? Because it helps me focus, and it gives me a clear insight into how I spend my time, both online and offline. The best part: I hardly need to fill in anything, the app provides all the details of sites and apps I use on my computer and, my phone.\n\nIt takes some time, in the beginning, to set things up; you have to teach the app what you consider very productive, productive, neutral, distractive, or very distractive. But, then, it gives a clear overview of your productivity on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. As a pro-subscriber, I can also fill in time I did not spend on my computer. ​\n\nBesides: In RescueTime,​ I can set focus time; After spending more than one hour on distracting time during work hours, ​the app blocks all websites and apps I consider distracting.",
      "# [8 Best Social Feed Blockers To Stop Mindless Scrolling by Juliet Dreamhunter on 2023-04-14](https://juliety.com/social-feed-blockers)\nSocial media has an undeniable pull that spares no one: even the most hardworking CEOs and dedicated students can find themselves lost in the digital abyss. The only thing that is guaranteed to save you from mindless scrolling when you need to get work done is a social feed blocker.\n\nIn this article, we’ll take a look at the eight best social feed blockers available in 2024 and see a bunch of interesting ways they can help you avoid digital distractions.\n\nYou might be familiar with website blockers already and wondering if it’s the same thing. It’s not. Instead of completely blocking your access to specific websites as those apps do, social feed blockers exclusively block the feeds and distracting sidebars, allowing you to access other features of a chosen social network.\n\nDepending on your work, you might sometimes need access to messages on Facebook or your playlists on YouTube, and blocking the websites completely might not be an option for you. That’s where social feed blockers come into the picture: they hide the unimportant attention-seeking content and guide you carefully to the pages you are looking for.\n\nWhat is a social media feed blocker?\n\nA social media feed blocker is a software tool or browser extension designed to help you minimize distractions by blocking or limiting access to your social media feeds. These blockers can temporarily or permanently hide social media content, allowing you to focus on more important tasks or projects.\n\nBy reducing the temptation to mindlessly scroll through posts, social media feed blockers can significantly improve your productivity.\n\nSome of these tools are pretty similar in basic functionality, but each has a unique twist. In this guide, I didn’t include any copycat tools that duplicate the popular apps exactly. Instead, you will see a range of the most useful social media blocking solutions and several unique browser extensions.\n\nWith that said, let’s take a look at the 8 best social feed blockers.\n\n1. Best social feed blocker:\n\nNews Feed Eradicator\n\nNews Feed Eradicator is a free, open-source Chrome extension I use to block my social feeds. It takes less than a minute to install and set it up, and it works great out of the box.\n\nThe settings can’t be any simpler: you literally block every site in one click.\n\nPersonally, I only block Facebook and YouTube as I identified them as my main time wasters. For you, it may be Twitter and Reddit, or even all of them.\n\nI’m sure you know your most tempting socials. If not, install a time tracker first and find out where your time gets lost.\n\nThere is also an option to turn the blocker off for 5 minutes, one hour, or one day.\n\nExample of a blocked feed\n\nThis is how my Youtube feed looks right now:\n\nAs you can see, there is an empty space where the feed usually is. Instead, there is a nice inspirational quote, so I’m getting a bit of wisdom instead of wasting my time watching random stuff. Double-win!\n\nIf you don’t want the quotes, you can turn them off in settings. Or just remove the ones you don’t like. Or even use your own list of quotes!\n\nOther than cleaning the homepage, News Feed Eradicator removes the “similar videos” section that usually shows in the right sidebar when you are watching something. It makes it really easy to just leave the website after you get the information you need.\n\nAnd in case you are wondering where the Shorts tab went, I also have a separate extension that removes shorts from my feed. Personally, I don’t see the value in them, and they used to clutter my subscriptions feed – so I eliminated them, too.\n\n2. Best social media blocker: Freedom\n\nLet’s be honest: not everyone needs access to social media when working or studying. Your scrolling addiction might be convincing you that you need it, but if that’s not true, you might be better off with a blocker that removes temptations completely.\n\nFreedom is one of the most popular social media blockers: millions of people rely on it to remove all their desktop and mobile distractions. It claims to give you back around 2.5 hours of time daily by stopping you from accessing distracting apps and sites.\n\nImagine how much your life could change if you had two more hours every day!\n\nHow Freedom blocks socials\n\nWith Freedom, you can create a list of specific sites you want to block, starting with pre-defined social media, shopping, and entertainment websites that are known as the most common distractions.\n\nHere is an example of social media blocking setup, courtesy of Freedom:\n\nWhenever you need to focus, start a Freedom session, and it will handle all the distractions for you, according to your settings. You can also schedule your sessions in advance, for example, if you want to block a regular daily time for focused work.\n\nThis tool is available for Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android, and also as a Chrome extension. It syncs across all your devices, allowing you to block all sources of distractions at once.\n\nAn app like Freedom can even block the whole internet if you seriously need to focus on your task. This is particularly useful if you keep finding new ways to procrastinate or are close to a deadline.\n\nExample of a blocked feed\n\nThis is what you will see when you try to open a restricted website during a focus session with Freedom:\n\nThe best feature of Freedom\n\nIf you don’t trust yourself to stay focused even with social feed blockers and will probably try to bypass the restriction, Freedom has a special feature just for you.\n\nIt is called the Locked Mode, and it basically protects your focus session when your willpower is not particularly reliable. This means you won’t be able to turn it off in any way until the session ends.\n\nYou might be smart, but Freedom is smarter. It already knows every possible workaround. When in Locked Mode, it will prevent you from doing things like removing sites from the blocklist, deleting devices from your account, or even changing the timezone in your system.\n\n(Use code JULIETY30 for 30% off)\n\n3. Automatic social feed blocker: RescueTime\n\nRescueTime is not just a tool for blocking social feeds – it takes your whole work experience to the next level. Think of it as your productivity assistant that has your productivity as its first priority.\n\nRescueTime is one of the best focus apps available in 2024. It allows you to set daily goals for focused work, reminds you to get back on track if you get distracted, and gives a quick breakdown of your productivity at the end of the day.\n\nYou don’t need to choose specific websites or dive into a detailed setup: simply start a focus session, and it will automatically block everything that’s a distraction.\n\nHow RescueTime blocks socials\n\nRescueTime groups all websites and apps into categories and assigns a level to each category, from “very productive” to “very distracting.” You have full control over categories and can choose the minimum level of distractions you want to be blocked by default.\n\nThe websites will have the “Unblock this page” button, which will make you wait 15 seconds and then unlock the site. This should give you enough time to snap out of automatic behavior and bring yourself back to work.\n\nAlternatively, there is an option to disable unblocking entirely.\n\nExample of a blocked feed\n\nThis is what you see when trying to access a social media page during a Focused Session with RescueTime:\n\nOther social feed blocking extensions\n\nThe three blocking tools above are more than enough to prevent you from mindlessly scrolling social media. Of course, there are plenty of other apps and extensions that can block your feeds: but please don’t make exploring ALL the options your new way of procrastination.\n\nI am not going to mention the tools that do exactly the same as the already mentioned ones, but here are five more Chrome extensions that bring something unique into the picture.\n\nHideFeed\n\nHideFeed is a social media blocking extension that covers everything but the website header with an image.\n\nThis way, you still have access to the important features, but the rest of the information is hidden to prevent you from distractions.\n\nHere is how a blocked website might look with HideFeed:\n\nHideFeed allows you to choose a theme for the images, for example, “puppies” or “ocean.” It can also hide parts of specific websites, for example, a distracting sidebar with news on Twitter.\n\nThe only disadvantage I found in HideFeed is that you can reveal everything back with a single click – which doesn’t really help you avoid procrastination.\n\nUnDistracted\n\nUnDistracted is another Chrome extension for blocking social media feeds I found useful. It allows you to customize in detail which parts of every social network you want to block.\n\nUnDistracted can protect you from scrolling Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, Reddit, Netflix, and Linkedin. If you have other distracting websites in mind or want a global automatic solution, this might be not a good choice for you.\n\nAs an example, these were my Facebook settings with UnDistracted:\n\nThis tool also allows you to block the whole website. If you turn ‘Block Facebook’ on, trying to get to Facebook will redirect you to Google or your chosen website.\n\nYou can always stop blocking when you don’t need it (say, on the weekend), pause it for 5 minutes for a quick break, or turn it off for a specific time of day.\n\nBeTimeFul\n\nBeTimeFul is a social feed blocker that saves you from social media addictions.\n\nIt’s pretty similar to the other ones in a way that it removes all the distracting parts of the social networks, such as feeds, sidebars, and other nonessential areas. But instead of replacing it with a quote or an image, it simply leaves everything blank.\n\nBeTimeFul has hundreds of positive reviews and happy users. The only reason I personally don’t like it is that it makes you sign up through Google or Facebook in order to use it. Other social feed blockers on this list don’t require you to create an account or link your socials in any way.\n\nCurrently, BeTimeFul only supports YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Linkedin, and Twitter.\n\nDelayed Gratification\n\nThis is a fun extension that doesn’t block the social network per se but lets you reconsider procrastinating by delaying access to the website for a given time.\n\nSince instant gratification is what most humans are addicted to these days, this delay stops your automatic scrolling patterns and gives you time to “wake up” and rethink your decision to go waste more time.\n\nThis tool has the simplest settings you can imagine. This is basically all of it:\n\nDoesn’t really need explaining, does it?\n\nAnd here is how a blocked website looks when you attempt to open it:\n\nIf you don’t want a comprehensive social feed-blocking tool and delaying distractions is enough for you to realize what you are doing and get back to work, Delayed Gratification might be a good choice for you.\n\nOne major downside of this extension is that it doesn’t pause counting when you leave the tab. Basically, you can “wait it out” by doing something else and come back later when it’s ready. This may be not restrictive enough for chronic procrastinators.\n\nMindful Internet Use\n\nThe final social media blocker I’m reviewing today is called Mindful Internet Use.\n\nIt has a beautiful minimalist interface and makes you take several breaths before you can access one of the blocked websites.\n\nBy default, it needs you to breathe four times in a 4-2-4 pattern (inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 2, exhale for 4). However, you may change it to another number and choose a different pattern, such as box breathing 4-4-4-4 (adds a hold after the exhale part) or simple in-and-out for 5 seconds each.\n\nFunnily enough, it also makes you do the breathing if you want to change certain settings. I found this a little frustrating; gotta be more mindful, I guess.\n\nAnother interesting feature has to do with quotes. You may choose to show a quote in the corner during breathing, or keep it simple.\n\nYou can also make reaching a blocked website even harder for yourself by requiring you to type in the full quote after you finish the breathing part.\n\nFinally, it addresses the problem Delayed Gratification has in regard to tab switching. If you leave the tab mid-breath or even mid-typing and then come back, it will make you do the breathing all over again.\n\nFinal thoughts on blocking social feeds\n\nAnd there you have it: eight great social feed-blocking tools to beat your social media addiction! Armed with these remarkable blockers, you are now equipped to stop yourself from the never-ending scroll and steer your focus toward those fulfilling projects and goals that truly matter.\n\nRemember, the journey to living your dream life starts with prioritizing your time and energy wisely. Block everything that distracts you from your goals and dedicate your time to making steps in the right direction.",
      "# [Best time management app of 2024 by Jonas P. DeMuro, Craig Hale on 2022-05-22](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-time-management-solution)\nWe list the best time management apps, to make it simple and easy to manage and track time, tasks, and improve productivity goals for yourself or employees.\n\nThis is important, because time management is an essential skill to learn when involved with running a business, department, or other managerial duties.\n\nMany workers find that they struggle to fit in all their designated work into a day, with some studies uncovering the alarmingly high amount of time we spend in (often pointless) video calls each week - accounting for an estimated fifth of our time. A good time management app will help any individual to understand their working day and prioritize the right tasks as they reach optimal workload management, but it should also be easy to use without adding to the burden.\n\nMost of the apps we looked at offer individual as well as team tracking, and provide features for tracking time not least for counting billable time, Internet use, and time spent on an individual project. This can be useful for a variety of working types, ranging from businesses to self-employed workers who want to get a better understanding of how they spend their time to be able to generate more accurate invoices for clients.\n\nSome have goals built into them, or general analysis of time used through the day, to help you better identify time sinks and lazy periods when you can be more productive.\n\nWhere team features are available, this allows you to compare your own performance with others from your team, and use insights into how to not just better manage your own time, but how others in the team can learn from each other to do the same.\n\nHere then, are the best time management apps currently available in 2024.\n\nWe've also featured the best accounting software for small business.\n\nThe best time management apps of 2024 in full:\n\nBest time management app for automation\n\nTimecamp has a number of simple-to-use functions related to time tracking aimed at maximizing team productivity. The feature set includes billable time tracking, sending invoices based on time spent, an attendance tracker, and team time tracking.\n\nThere is also automated time tracking which can be used for employee Internet usage monitoring, and to assign an entry to the correct project. The time management software function puts this all together to be able to track a team’s time spent on a project, and also their productivity.\n\nAdmins can also benefit from reporting to help them understand how their time is being spent. Not only does this provide insight into workers’ efficiency, but it can be a valuable tool for tracking projects that are run by different funding pots, which is a very common scenario in non-profit organizations that receive funding from grants.\n\nIt also can integrate with over 50 productivity tools for ease of use, including project management tools like Airtable, Asana, and Monday.com, as well as communication and video conferencing platforms like Teams and Slack, accounting software like Xero, and numerous calendar apps.\n\nThere is a free tier for limited use as it only supports a single user. The next higher plan is the Basic tier, which has no limit on the number of users, supports billable time functions and offers both a monthly and annual subscription. There are also Pro and Enterprise plans for larger organizations.\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nBest time management app for mobiles\n\nWonder no more “where the day has gone,” with the Chrometa software that can capture automatically the tasks that you and your team work on. It does this by capturing the URL of the website that you visit, the subject and addressee information from an email, and the file info when working on a local file - and stops the clock when you go away from the computer. It can also track things like mouse movements across Windows and macOS devices, which can be a good way of monitoring pauses but may raise some privacy concerns.\n\nThere’s also an emphasis on finances, with features like budget monitoring and the promise of minimizing admin costs. There’s a healthy number of integrations, including numerous finance-related ones like Quickbooks, Xero, and Freshbooks, however beyond this, it doesn’t quite meet the level of other rivals.\n\nThis time management app also captures, via Android and iOS apps, phone calls and text messages to turn time on a mobile device into billable time as well.\n\nThere is the offer of a 30-day free trial, but no free plan so it’s not necessarily a cost-effective solution for smaller businesses. There are three tiers, each with differing numbers of supported devices, data storage, and levels of support. They’re billed on a per-user basis.\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nBest time management app for multiple devices\n\nToggl takes a simplistic approach to time management, with included tracking reminders, and idle detection to make sure the job gets done which can be especially useful for remote workers who find themselves getting distracted. It also has cross-platform support, so for example, time tracking can begin in the browser of a desktop PC, and then be stopped on a smartphone with time entries synced between devices; there are mobile apps and browser extensions to accomplish this, but you won’t have a large pick of the best browsers: only Chrome and Firefox are supported.\n\nToggl also makes it simple to break down your hours worked, by either the project, the client, or the task, and can then analyze them to determine which is making the best return for the hours spent to facilitate maximizing profits. The Toggl app is simple, but unfortunately, it does not support invoicing.\n\nThere’s Sign in with Google support which could suit a large number of businesses using Google Workspace, and also Sign in with Apple for those tied into the Apple ecosystem.\n\nIntegrations are aplenty and include services from Zoho, Asana, Adobe, and Google. There’s also an API available to be able to track something that Toggl Track doesn’t already support, making it one of the most powerful tools out there.\n\nA free tier for up to five workers is available, along with a pair of paid plans and an Enterprise plan that can be customized. Pricing is fairly average, though not cheap, but there are savings to be had for annual subscriptions. All plans also come with a 30-day free trial with no payment card required, so you can really get to know the time tracker before committing to any big spends.\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nBest time management app for currency support\n\nFor freelancers and companies alike, Tmetric dubs itself a ‘work time tracker,’ which via a clean interface provides “great control over time intervals and project budgets.” The key is a visual timeline that gives insight into the activities throughout the day, which you can turn into billable hours.\n\nTmetric boasts over 40,000 users, and over nine million hours of time tracked, including time off, team management, and reporting for all tiers (to varying degrees).\n\nThe process can be automated as there are browser add-ons to directly and seamlessly capture every minute of data to feed back into Tmetric, which is then tracked, to totally capture each and every billable minute. It also benefits from compatibility with all major PC and mobile operating systems, including Linux, so most businesses should be able to use it in some form.\n\nFurthermore, there is support for different currencies, and the ability to track costs per team, to help maximize income while keeping projects within a predefined budget. Finally, tasks can be tracked by individual team members to follow their productivity, and compared to their peers.\n\nThis flexible time management app has a free tier that supports up to 5 users. The Professional tier is available which adds billable rates, invoicing and to-do lists. The top tier Business plan adds Timesync with Jira and Redmine, and can provide cost rates for employees. Both paid plans have a 30-day free trial available, and there are discounts for annual subscriptions.\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nBest time management app for focus\n\nRescueTime has the laudable goal of eliminating distractions and focusing on productivity. It is quite feature-rich and allows you to set goals, providing each user with feedback such as alerts when daily goals have been met.\n\nBesides the features you’d expect, there are some health-focused additions like daily focus and coaching tips. In fact, the company claims that driving for sky-high productivity can become toxic, and is an advocate of the four-day working week.\n\nThere is a free plan called RescueTime Lite that can track time used on websites, set goals, and even provides a weekly email report. More serious time management aficionados can step up to the sole choice of a paid plan, known as RescueTime Premium.\n\nRescueTime tracks what you're working on and will let you know if you're trying to do too much at once or otherwise losing focus. We think it's one of the best time management apps for helping you stay on task.\n\nIt’s worth noting that, while there’s support for both of the leading operating systems, Windows users will need to be running Windows 10 or later. That should be fine, because figures suggest that many businesses are sticking to 10 and taking a more cautious approach to Windows 11, though there may still be some organizations that require older operating systems. macOS support extends back to 2016’s 10.12 Sierra.\n\nThe paid plan builds on the free offering with additional features including tracking time away from the computer (such as phone calls), keeping a log of daily accomplishments, and the ability to block distracting websites. There is a free 14-day trial for the paid tier. Additionally, users will have the pick of a modern-looking “New RescueTime” or the detailed “RescueTime Classic,” though it’s unclear how long both will be supported.\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nBest time management app for security\n\nDo you need a time management app that allays your privacy concerns about sending data to the cloud? ManicTime is downloadable software that is run locally and keeps its data local and does not connect to some remote server. You’ll be fine if you use Windows, macOS, and even Linux, but mobile support only extends to Android users so workers conducting business from their iOS devices won’t be able to benefit from it.\n\nJust like the cloud-based solutions above, it can automatically keep track of time spent, whether on a local file, or through a website. ManicTime also integrates with task-based systems, like Github or Jira. The software can also be used for creating timesheets for workers who need to report back to a manager, for example those working on multiple projects simultaneously.\n\nManicTime makes it easy to turn your tracked hours into custom reports, presenting any additional data you might require. These are formatted and ready for import into your preferred spreadsheet or invoicing software.\n\nThe software is available to download for a one-time fee, however support and updates are only supported for one year after which you can either carry on with the version you ended on or pay again to continue receiving updates.\n\nIf you like using ManicTime but decided you'd prefer a time management app with cloud functionality, there's a cloud-based version too, which works on an ongoing subscription basis.\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nBest lightweight time management app\n\nTicking off items on a to-do list is hugely satisfying, and is a time-honored way to manage your time and get more done during the day. While Todoist isn’t strictly a time-tracking app, it’s a perfect entry-level option for workers seeking to manage their allocation of work.\n\nTodoist is a simple but effective tool for desktop and mobile that lets you set recurring events and essential one-off tasks, and check them off once they're complete. You'll receive a schedule of jobs at the start of each day (unless you choose not to), giving you a sneak peak of what lays ahead so you can prioritize your work according to your schedule and preferences.\n\nTasks are collected in groups called 'Projects', though these might be more accurately called 'Activities'. The default options include shopping, personal, errands and work, and you can add or edit them to suit you.\n\nSome features are exclusive to the premium version, and unfortunately, you won’t always know until you try to select one, but the free version has plenty of tools to help you achieve more every day.\n\nIf you're looking for a more heavy-duty tool for tasks with multiple parts and deadlines, take a look at Trello. It's generally a better tool for business use, whereas Todoist is perfect for your own personal tasks and better suited to individual, self-employed workers and small, close teams.\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nWe've also featured the best to do list apps.\n\nMore time management software options\n\nThere are a lot of software apps available for different aspects of accounts and productivity, and time management is no different. Here we'll feature a selection of additional platforms worth considering as well as those above:\n\nClockify is a simple time tracker and timesheet app for teams that has the distinction of also being free. While that usually means a trade-off in terms of features, Clockify manages to retain essential functionality. Aside from a time tracker and timesheets, it also provides the ability to set up and manage projects and teams, as well as a dashboard to provide an overview of projects as well as analytics based on use.\n\nFocusBooster is another paid time management app that offers simple time tracking as well as a to-do list and productivity reports. However, it takes a more unique approach in encouraging work in small bursts with breaks in between so that you can balance work with life and play. There's a free tier available, but even paid pricing remains relatively cheap depending on the number of features required.\n\nTick offers a more advanced time tracking solution for specifically working with teams, and offers mobile apps for use with Android and iOS as well as for desktop PCs. At its core is a time track which allows managers to then track budgets and profitability. Tick can also be integrated with other productivity software such as Basecamp.\n\nHubStaff is another managerial time tracking solution, offering a wide range of features such as timesheets, GPS tracking, team scheduling, productivity monitoring, and of course reporting for insights. You can import projects or start new ones, and begin time tracking from then. There's also a wide range of integrations available, from Asana to Zoho Projects.\n\nHarvest gears itself more toward larger companies, with customers including Volkswagen and Dell. There are desktop and mobile apps, and integrations with some key services like Google Chrome and GitHub. Admins can also manage projects and the software supports invoice issuing with companies like Stripe and PayPal. There’s a free version available, and the single paid tier also represents good value for money.\n\nProductive appeals to agencies with a variety of workers under their umbrellas, and has all the usual time tracking features. It markets itself as a “one-stop shop,” so you can also expect resource planning tools, budgeting, billing, reporting, and more. It’s not a particularly cheap piece of kit, but should help you eliminate the need for other software so may work out cheaper if you’re likely to use everything. A trio of paid tiers each with free trials and annual subscription savings are topped by a customizable enterprise plan\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nWe've also featured the best employee scheduling software.\n\nBest time management app FAQs\n\nWhat is a time management app?\n\nTime management apps come in various shapes and sizes, but they all have one thing in common. They track the time that you spend on activities you wish to track.\n\nThis is useful for businesses tracking hours worked by remote staff, or for freelancers who need to know how many hours they have spent working on a particular project.\n\nBeyond tracking hours, some time tracking apps can automatically generate invoices, give you tips on working more efficiently, and even warn you if you're losing focus.\n\nHow to choose the best time management app for you\n\nChoosing the best time management app for you starts with understanding how you want to use the data captured. If you want to track your own work and have no need for integration with other software, a no-frills free time tracker could be all you ever need.\n\nIndividuals who want an app that keeps them focused and helps with invoicing would be better served by a more advanced app. Similarly, business users who wish to track multiple employees will benefit from a cloud-based time management app with enhanced reporting features.\n\nShould I pay for a time management app?\n\nThere are some free versions available, but in the majority of cases you’ll find yourself paying for a time management app, especially if you need premium features like reporting, timesheets, billing, and so on.\n\nHowever, ask yourself whether it’s a time management app you need. Maybe your business could benefit from a scheduling app, or an employee scheduling app.\n\nHow we tested the best time management apps\n\nTo test for the best time management apps we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, whether as a download or as an online service. We then tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each software platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools. As well as comparing different price points, we compared time management apps with other, similar pieces of kit to help determine whether the features included represent good value for money, or whether they already come as part of another service you could already be paying for.\n\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\n\nGet in touch\n\nWant to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

But the text messages came in fast and furious early this morning…\n\n“My teams are very quiet.”\n\n“Our folks need perspective and wisdom right now.”\n\n“It feels like a dark tunnel ahead.”\n\n“I need to connect privately with our peer group.”\n\nThe sheer weight of the US post-election day motivated me to acknowledge what I am observing.\n\nTo feel all the feels with my community. To hold space for multiple perspectives and emotions. When we recognize and name the emotions we are experiencing, we eventually find and lead our way through the grief gauntlet.\n\nTo move forward together, we need a moment to pause, name the emotions, and acknowledge them.\n\nIt’s counter-intuitive in Western culture. We are conditioned to power through and get busy (whatever that means!).\n\nBut reflection and recognition need to happen now. That helps us heal.\n\nSo, instead of putting on a phony smiley face, and publishing an awe-filled story about The Midlife Innovator Santa Fe retreat takeaways, or sharing many gorgeous photos from Rising Circle Ranch, I’m sending a simple message today:\n\nStrengthen your transition muscles.\n\nYour family, friends, and organization are relying on you to be strong, vulnerable, and self-aware.\n\nAnd here’s another universal truth: If you truly want to guide others through this messy middle, you need to go first.\n\nAs Chip Conley says, “Our painful life lessons are the raw material for our future wisdom.”\n\nWant to fill your wisdom well now?

Keltner presents compelling evidence that three elements of awe—moral beauty (cultivating third vault, deeply personal conversations), collective effervescence (community), and nature—help us thrive and evolve. Absent of awe, our world feels pale, stale, and stuck.\n\nI recommend AWE to any leader who faces the messy middle of midlife or wants to successfully lead a company transformation.\n\nAppreciative Inquiry: A Positive Revolution in Change by David Cooperrider and Diana Whitney\n\nThis book introduces Appreciative Inquiry, a strengths-based approach to organizational and personal development.

Ellen’s dinner discussion during our MEA retreat added a fresh dimension to our innovation journey. Her talk was brimming with practical wisdom and humor.\n\nThe Alchemist by Paulo Coelho\n\nThis timeless and inspiring novel tells the story of Santiago, a shepherd boy who embarks on a journey to discover his personal legend. Coleho teaches us about the importance of following one’s dreams and listening to one’s heart. I have read this three times.

      "# [20 Must-Know Tips for Working From Home by Jill Duffy on 2024-08-05](https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/get-organized-20-tips-for-working-from-home)\nI've worked 100% remotely since 2015, with a few years of partial remote work before that. I've been covering remote work trends since around the same time and even wrote a book called The Everything Guide to Remote Work that goes into incredible detail about all the various aspects of remote work and hybrid work. And every so often, I need a refresher on how to stay happy and productive while doing it.\n\nEach of us faces unique challenges when working remotely, not only because of our different personalities but also due to our various lifestyles and the type of work we do. Still, many of the core issues we face as remote workers are similar.\n\nHere are 20 tips for leading a better and more productive remote-work life, based on my experience and what I've learned in my years of covering remote work as a writer.\n\n1. Maintain Regular Hours...Most of the Time\n\nSet a schedule and stick to it...most of the time. Having clear guidelines for when to work and when to call it a day helps many remote workers maintain a healthy work–personal life balance.\n\nThat said, one of the best benefits of remote work is flexibility when the job allows for it. Sometimes, you need to extend your day or start early to accommodate someone else's time zone. When you do, be sure to wrap up earlier than usual or sleep in a bit the next morning to make up for it.\n\nAutomatic time-tracking apps, such as RescueTime, let you check whether you're sticking to your schedule. They can also help you figure out what times of day you're most productive versus when you slack off. You can use that information to your advantage by protecting the hours when you're most likely to get difficult work done. For example, if you tend to have high productivity between 9:30 and 11:30 a.m., don't schedule meetings during that time.\n\n(Credit: RescueTime)\n\n2. Create a Morning Routine\n\nDeciding you'll sit down at your desk and start work at a certain time is one thing. Creating a routine that guides you into the chair is another.\n\nA routine can be more powerful than a clock in helping you get started each day. What in your morning routine indicates you're about to start work? It might be making a cup of coffee before you tackle your to-do list. It might be returning home after a jog or getting dressed. (Wearing pajamas is a work-from-home perk for some but a bad strategy for others.) Look for an existing habit that you have, like brushing your teeth or coming in from a dog walk, to act as your signal. That way, you can tack on the new habit of kicking off your workday.\n\nI say \"morning routine,\" but not everyone who works from home follows a nine-to-five schedule. Yours might be a \"getting started\" routine at another time of day. Nevertheless, look for an existing habit you have and try to start your work day after it.\n\n3. Set Ground Rules With the People in Your Space\n\nSet ground rules with other people in your home or who share your space when you work.\n\nFor example, if you have children who learn at home or who come home from school while you're still working, they need clear rules about what they can and cannot do during that time.\n\nIf you share a space with another adult who's home at the same time, you may have to negotiate quiet times, meeting times, and any shared equipment, like desks and chairs. Simply knowing that another person has a meeting at a certain time helps you prepare to work around it. You might need to get a pair of socks from the bedroom before another person goes in there and closes the door for a meeting.\n\nYou're a remote worker, not the house manager.\n\n- The Everything Guide to Remote Work\n\nAdditionally, just because you're home and can let in service people or take care of pets doesn't mean other family members should assume you always will. As I put it in my book, \"You're a remote worker, not the house manager.\" If you choose to take on the bulk of the domestic labor because you work from home, that's fine, but if you simply take it on by default because you're home, you may feel taken advantage of, and your ability to get your job done may suffer.\n\n4. Schedule Your Breaks\n\nIf you work for an organization, know the policy on break times and take them. If you're self-employed, give yourself adequate time during the day to walk away from the computer screen and phone. A lunch hour and two 15-minute breaks seem to be the standard for full-time US employees. For computer-based work and other sedentary work, it's important to stand up and move to get your blood circulating every so often, at least once an hour. It also helps to move your eyes off of the screen regularly, even if it's a micro-break of 10 to 20 seconds.\n\n5. Take Breaks in Their Entirety\n\nDon't short-change yourself during breaks, especially your lunch hour or meal break. There are apps, such as TimeOut for Mac and Smart Break for Windows, that let you set a schedule for when you'll lock yourself out of your computer. I personally find those apps to be more trouble than they're worth. Establishing a routine is a much better and more reasonable solution in my mind.\n\nSet an alarm or timer on your phone, or simply mind the time with a standard clock. No matter how you track your breaks, make sure to take them in their entirety. For example, if you plan for an hour break and return to your desk after only 40 minutes, walk away for another 20.\n\n6. Leave Home\n\nTo the extent that you can, get out of the house and move your body. Your body needs blood circulation. Plus, the fresh air and natural light will do you good. Ideally, step outside for at least a short while before, during, and after your working hours.\n\nThis same advice applies equally to people who do in-person work. Leave the building at least once a day during working hours.\n\nIf your circumstances and conditions allow, you might also go to cafes, libraries, and co-working spaces to break up the monotony of being at home. That's great, but the really important part is to leave your home, get some air and natural light, and move.\n\nYou don't have to go to crowded public spaces to get away from your solo workspace. Take a walk. Weed the garden. Sit on the stoop. You get the picture.\n\n7. Don't Hesitate to Ask for What You Need\n\nIf you're employed by a company or organization that supports your work-from-home setup, request the equipment you need as soon as you start working from home or within a few days of realizing you need something new.\n\nIt's extremely important to set a precedent early that you will ask for what you need to get your job done comfortably. These items might include the right monitor, keyboard, mouse, chair, desk, printer, software, and so forth. Organizations that are accustomed to remote employees often have a budget for home office equipment. Ask what it is and how often it's renewed. It also doesn't hurt to ask whether there's a loan agreement or who will pay for return shipping or disposal of outdated equipment. Some remote organizations allow employees to bring in a consultant to make sure their workspaces are set up to be ergonomic.\n\nIf you're working from home temporarily and are expected to return to an office when it's safe, ask for what you need but be willing to make acceptable compromises. Ordering a new office chair and desk might be off the table. Instead, a mouse, keyboard, laptop riser, and back-supporting cushion go a long way, and they can cost less than $200. There are other cheap and easy ways to improve your home office, too.\n\n(Credit: Sonic Electronix)\n\n8. Keep a Dedicated Office Space—Even If It's Just a Chair\n\nIn an ideal world, remote employees would have not only a dedicated office but also two computers, one for work and one for personal use. This arrangement would be more secure for the employer and would allow you to do all of your NSFW activities in private.\n\nBut not everyone has a spare room to use as an office in their home, and keeping two machines isn't always realistic. Instead, dedicate a desk or table space—or even a particular seat at the kitchen table—that you'll use only for work.\n\nYou may want to create a separate user account on your computer to separate your work activities from your personal stuff. Making even small points of differentiation between work time and personal time helps your brain know when you're off the clock, which contributes to clearer boundaries.\n\n9. Maintain a Separate Phone Number\n\nIf your job involves taking old-fashioned phone calls, set up a phone number that you only use for calls with colleagues and clients. It doesn't have to be a landline, a second mobile phone, or even require a SIM card. It can be a VoIP service, such as Google Voice or Skype.\n\nSimilar to some of the other tips, having a separate phone number helps you manage your work-life balance and boundaries.\n\n10. Use a VPN\n\nUse a VPN whenever you're connected to a network that you don't control. That includes Wi-Fi at co-working spaces, cafes, libraries, airports, hotels, and so forth. Organizations often have their own VPNs that off-site employees need to access certain servers or websites that store information meant only for internal use. In those cases, you'll also need to use a VPN at home. It's a good idea to get into the habit of leaving your VPN connected as often as possible because it's always safer to have it on than not.\n\nVPNs are one security measure, and there are other steps you can take to increase security while working from home. One more point about VPNs: When you're connected to an organization's network, your employer could conceivably see what you're doing, so don't view porn via a corporate VPN.\n\n11. Socialize With Colleagues\n\nLoneliness, disconnect, and isolation are common problems in remote work, especially for extroverts. Building relationships with colleagues remotely takes effort. Companies with a remote work culture usually offer ways to socialize. For example, they might have channels in a team messaging app, like Slack, for talking about common interests or organizing meetups for people in the same region.\n\nHow much interpersonal interaction do you need to feel connected and included at work? The answer is not the same for everyone. Even if you're highly introverted or don't like socializing at your job, give a few interactive experiences a try, whether it's an online happy hour or a book club, so that you're familiar with them if you ever decide you want them. If your workplace doesn't have a strong remote culture, you may need to be more proactive about nurturing relationships.\n\nAs much as team messaging apps are excellent venues for socializing, they tend to create distractions, too; check out these tips on how not to get overwhelmed by Slack.\n\n(Credit: Slack)\n\n12. 'Show Up' to Meetings and Be Heard\n\nCertainly, you'll participate in video conferences and conference calls while working remotely. It's a good idea to attend optional meetings from time to time as a way to be seen. Be sure to speak up during meetings so everyone knows you're on the call. A simple \"Thanks, everyone. Bye!\" at the close goes a long way toward making your presence known.\n\nDon't wait around for someone to invite you to the office or an event. Be proactive. Make the ask.\n\nIf your company uses Zoom Meetings for video conferencing, our story on Top Zoom Tips for Better Video Calls will help you quickly master its ins and outs.\n\n13. Get Face Time\n\nIf your employer is lax about getting you in a room with other employees, ask to have an annual or semi-annual trip in your contract. It could be for planning, training, or team building. Or, tack it onto some other business event, such as a yearly fiscal meeting, nearby conference, or office holiday party. Don't wait around for someone to invite you to the office or an event. Be proactive. Make the ask.\n\nFor those unexpectedly working from home who are also trying to reduce face-to-face contact, set up a video call with your colleagues or manager once a week to check in. Don't be afraid to let check-in meetings be as short as they need to be. Sometimes, a five-minute conversation is all it takes to stay connected.\n\n14. Take Sick Days\n\nWhen you're not well, take time off. If sick days are part of your compensation package, take the time off that you need. Not taking it is like throwing away money!\n\nIf you're self-employed and don't get paid sick time, it can be tempting to power through illnesses and keep working. Remember that for your long-term wellness and productivity, it's best to rest and get better so that you can get back to work at full capacity.\n\n15. Look for Training and Learning Opportunities\n\nWhen you're not in an office with your fellow employees, you might miss out on training and skills development courses that are taught in person. Your company might even forget to add you to its online training courses. It can be tempting to regard this as a dodged bullet, but you might be missing out on an opportunity to learn something useful. Speak up and make sure you're included.\n\n(Credit: LinkedIn/PCMag)\n\nIn addition to top-down training, you can request online or in-person courses, training, and coaching if you need it. There are also plenty of online learning sites that teach business soft skills, programming, software skills, and other courses. Remote companies often have a budget for learning and skills training. If your organization doesn't, ask if they might add it.\n\nYou might also be eligible for learning opportunities at your organization's headquarters or other workspace. That way, you get training and face time with colleagues in one go.\n\n16. Over-Communicate\n\nWorking remotely requires that everyone over-communicate.\n\nTell everyone who needs to know about your schedule and availability often. Don't assume they'll remember. When you finish a project or important task, say so. Over-communicating doesn't necessarily mean you have to write a five-paragraph essay to explain your every move, but it does mean repeating yourself. Joke about how you must have mentioned your upcoming vacation six times already, then mention it again.\n\n17. Be Positive\n\nReading tone in written messages is really difficult in all-remote settings. The less face time you have with people, the more an intentionally concise message can come off as terse and short-tempered.\n\nIn remote work settings, everyone must be positive, to the point where it may feel like you're being overly positive, gushy even. Otherwise, you risk sounding like a jerk. It's unfortunate but true. So embrace the exclamation point! Find your favorite emoji. You're going to need them :D\n\n18. Take Advantage of Your Perks\n\nFor years, I've baked a loaf of bread nearly every week, and usually during the workweek. Why? Because I'm home and I can. I love baking bread, but you need to be there to tend to it once an hour or so to punch down the dough, shape the loaf, and let it bake. It doesn't take a lot of hands-on time, but you need to be around. When I worked in an office full-time, I struggled to find half a day when I was home to bake.\n\nWorking remotely comes with unique perks. Take advantage of them. You deserve it.\n\n19. Don't Be Too Hard on Yourself or Others\n\nSuccessful remote employees have a reputation for being extremely disciplined. After all, it takes serious focus to do any full-time job from an unconventional space.\n\nThat said, everyone lets their attention drift sometimes. If you find yourself working one minute and researching vacation house rentals the next, don't reprimand yourself too harshly. Instead, ask yourself whether people in an office setting do the same thing. If the answer is yes, cut yourself some slack, then get back to work. Above all, remember that you need to balance productivity with self-care. Otherwise, you risk burning out.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic—but really all the time—we need to extend this same kindness and forgiving attitude to our co-workers, clients, and bosses. There is an extraordinary amount of stress and anxiety during a global pandemic. Keep in mind that you may not know what another person is going through not only in life but also in their home work environment. Cut them some slack.\n\n20. End Your Day With a Routine\n\nJust as you should start your day with a routine, create a habit that signals the close of the workday. It might be a sign-off on a business messaging app, an evening dog walk, or an at-home yoga class. Something as simple as shutting down your computer and turning on a favorite podcast will do. Whatever you choose, do it consistently to mark the end of working hours.\n\nMake It Personal\n\nAbove all other advice and tips, figure out what works best for you. Sometimes, the answer is apparent; other times, you might need inspiration from other remote workers in the same boat. A supportive community is out there, whether you find it in your organization's Slack channel or online through blogs or Reddit. Consider, too, that you might need to shake up your routine once in a while, lest it get too...routine.",
