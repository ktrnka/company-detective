      "# [Privacy Policy](https://www.rescuetime.com/privacy)\nMost recent version: July 10, 2023.\n\nBy using RescueTime, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your personal information for the purposes of providing you our product services as described below. We will notify all active accounts of any significant changes to this policy.\n\nYour data is never shared\n\nYour privacy is really important to us. At RescueTime, your data, analyzed, is the product we offer back to you. We are not an ad supported company. Our free service is intended to entice you to premium service. If you have any concerns that aren't covered here, please contact us. Below are the details of this policy:\n\nWe will never sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal information, with or without personally identifying information. Furthermore, we will never share anonymized selections of your individual data. That includes any government (foreign or domestic) unless we are compelled by law. If we are required by law to disclose any of the information collected about you, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email. We will independently object to overly broad requests for access to information about users of our site.\n\nWe may share information about user behavior in the aggregate only. For example, we could share information like, \"which day of the week do people spend the most time in front of their computer?\" This type of analysis is used to enrich the product, and to represent our domain expertise to our audiences.\n\nYou can delete your data at any time — all of it, or just a slice of it. You can also delete your account at any time. Deleting your account deletes all your data from our database.\n\nWe won't spam you, ever, either directly or indirectly by sharing of email information. We might occasionally send one-time messages about important RescueTime news. We will likely continue to introduce ways that you can optionally have RescueTime contact you with data that you care about, but you will always be able to turn this on or off.\n\nFor individual accounts, no other user can see any of your data or personal information. We may provide features to allow you to share selections of your data, but this will be voluntary and opt-in only, and handled per-situation, and not buried in a terms of service.\n\nFor team accounts, sharing of data is controlled by the administrator of the account and by default does not allow anyone in the team account access to your data. No one outside of your organization will have access to any of your data. Default team implementations do not permit the sharing of individual data in any form that is not aggregated (eg, your team's average communication per week). When consulting with team implementations, we promote transparency and user driven control.\n\nHow do we protect your data?\n\nYour data is always encrypted in transit. All requests with the RescueTime web app and client apps are encrypted with current best practice SSL configurations.\n\nYour data is always encrypted at rest. All of our storage uses volume encryption.\n\nWe maintain ongoing vulnerability scanning, respond immediately to security advisories, and stay PCI compliant.\n\nWhat information does RescueTime collect? How is it used?\n\nAccount information includes email address (verification optional), city, state, and country. Optional demographic information includes gender, date of birth, industry, job title, company size, and income may be requested, to enrich the accuracy of our reporting for your work patterns.\n\nRescueTime records information about the currently active application or website on your computer. We record for processing the following information: 1) for time analysis: application name, web site URL, window title, start time of use, end time of use and 2) for distinguishing you and your device: device login name (your system user name), device name, device operating system version, and sometimes the manufacturer. For some inputs, the public internet address you are operating from is saved, for your security (and ours), and for troubleshooting. Like all activity information, it is discarded with account deletion.\n\nWe do not (and never will) collect keystrokes, form input, screenshots, window or page body content, or anything nefarious. Before storage for your reports, URLs are trimmed to the site name and sometimes top level directory when a site has distinct web apps. Query strings are discarded. Site controls allow you to selectively delete and ignore forever any item you prefer not be stored.\n\nCookies and Log Files\n\nRescueTime.com sends a \"cookie\" to your computer that contains an identifier that is unique to your browser session. We use this cookie to validate your authentication, provide you with a continuous experience, and to record how our site/service is being used. It is not used for marketing purposes.\n\nAs is done with most web sites, we log each visit to each web page. A log entry can contain information typically found in the \"header\" of your web browser's request such as the browser type you used, your Internet Protocol address, and the date and time of day. We may also log your session identifier and the URL of a site that referred you. This log information is important for security, audit, quality improvement, as well as for monitoring the health of our service.",
      "# [RescueTime Security](https://www.rescuetime.com/security)\nInfrastructure and Platform: Safe Foundations\n\nA secure design for hardware, networks, and deployments.\n\nTo make RescueTime work, there are two principle components: the application that runs on your device and the cloud-based service that processes the data and builds results for you. The client runs on multiple platforms and devices (Windows, Apple OS X, Linux, Android, ChromeOS), and is principally responsible for automatically measuring how the device is used. The client also offers some additional user-facing features that are best delivered outside the browser. The cloud service receives data from the client and also provides the client with statistics and configuration information to enrich the user's experience and manage client features.\n\nThe Client Application Platform\n\nFor desktop systems, the client is built on a common codebase using standard cross-platform libraries that work across Windows, OS X and Linux. This encompasses the code used for secure communication with our servers, as well as configuration handling and time logic. We maintain our client with regular updates, publish change information, audit and test all changes, and track dependent library security updates. Our client is designed to be lightweight, with a negligible memory and processor footprint, using a compact codebase and minimized complexity to reduce risk.\n\nFor mobile systems, we currently support automatic time collection on Android devices, including phones and tablets. Our app is built entirely inside the Android SDK and so takes advantage of the Google Android team's own security provisions (app sandboxing, regular platform maintenance updates, etc).\n\nMore about how the client works >>\n\nThe Cloud Service Platform\n\nRescueTime data processing, reporting, and account management is handled through our website locations, which are all hosted on Amazon's EC2 facility. Out of the box, EC2 gives us audited robust infrastructure security, both physical and network level. On that foundation, we provide additional feature-targeted firewalling, privilege separation and controls, two-factor access methods, and logged, auditable operations interfaces. Our website services are built on common open-source platforms, apps and frameworks that we monitor for regular security maintenance updates, both at the operating system level and for required apps and libraries.\n\nAll operational interaction with our platform is accomplished through either HTTPS or SSH (secure tunnels). Our testing and development deployments are maintained in a matching configuration, with access only through HTTPS and SSH tunnels. We do not maintain any office based data storage or services. All of our engineering resources are secured in EC2 under the same practices and policies applied to the production configuration.\n\nMore about the site and web services >>\n\nRescueTime and HIPAA, HITECH, SAS70 and more\n\nHow regulations and policies may affect you.\n\nHIPAA / HITECH: privacy and security requirements\n\nWe have clients, including individuals and teams, in many different lines of business. Some have concerns driven by protection of intellectual property, others have regulatory requirements. For those under HIPAA compliance standards for their software purchases:\n\nIs it even required? HIPAA requirements are triggered when a software product maintains patient identifiable information. For this reason, your use of RescueTime would likely be covered by HIPAA, because some applications' window titles may have a patient's name or similar small but identifiable detail. It would be possible to take advantage of our privacy configurations and controls to restrict what is captured and measured, to prevent this requirement altogether while using RescueTime. However, this may limit the utility of the product to you.\n\n... So, assuming you need HIPAA compliance to use RescueTime:\n\nSecure network transmission: HIPAA requires that all transmission of data between your business or our software be encrypted. RescueTime meets this requirement.\n\nPhysical security: The service must be hosted in an access limited and monitored facility. RescueTime meets this requirement by maintaining all resources in Amazon's EC2 data center.\n\nAccess control: Operational access to the service must be secured for authorized use only and be auditable. RescueTime meets this requirement.\n\nSafe practices and policies: The service should maintain disaster recovery plans and offsite backups. RescueTime meets this requirement, primarily by leveraging features of Amazon's EC2 service.\n\nThe HITECH supplement requires SaaS products to report intrusion or security events that effect customers' data. Specifically, the requirement is that if customer data resides in storage unencrypted (for example, a backup), even in a secured environment, that the service provider (us) must notify all and any customers whose data could have been vulnerable as the result of an intrusion event or other security violation. RescueTime guarantees its customers that it will alert any and all customers possibly affected by a security defect or hacking event.\n\nNote: At this time, RescueTime has not contracted an audit firm to provide third party validation of compliance. Please contact sales@rescuetime.com for more information on how we can accommodate your needs.\n\nSAS70 and the rest\n\nRescueTime is a fast growing business, and we contract services as needed as we continue to grow. As of this time we have not engaged our own SAS70 audit. Much of what these audits require is covered simply by operating on EC2. However, the web site services above and beyond the platform level is not. We are happy to consider all questions regarding obtaining audits. We have some clients that perform their own tests against our system to ensure we meet their standards.",
      "# [RescueTime Use Cases: Knowledge Workers, Entrepreneurs, Managers, Students](https://www.rescuetime.com/customer_stories)\nTell me if this sounds familiar: You’re working harder and longer than ever to meet deadlines and hit your goals. But no matter how much you work you still feel behind.\n\nThis was the exact situation AirBnB developer Jonathan White found himself in. With a full schedule at one of the biggest tech companies in the world, a number of side projects on the go, plus a social life, he found himself regularly working 12-14-hour days. But it still never felt like enough.\n\nEven worse, the more he tried to keep up with everything, the more he felt himself slipping towards burnout. Something had to change.\n\nHow Jonathan used RescueTime to optimize his time\n\nAfter using RescueTime for a few days, Jonathan started to see real data about his productive time. And it wasn’t great.\n\nBy looking at his Productivity by Time of Day, he quickly realized that despite working long hours (often late into the night) and feeling productive, there was a clear diminishing return the more he worked.\n\nSpecifically, his productivity levels were dipping in the evenings when he was more likely to get distracted by social media and entertainment.\n\n“Without knowing exactly how much and when you’re working there’s no way to optimize your time. You can’t hit any sort of consistency because you’re always guessing.”\n\nWith an accurate understanding of how he spends his time, Jonathan was able to optimize his daily schedule an do his most important work when he’s more productive.\n\nIn practical terms, this meant blocking out a 2-hour window first-thing in the morning for focused work and then cutting himself off earlier when he knew his productivity was going to slip. At first, the thought of working less and still hitting his goals seemed impossible\n\nBut he quickly found that even though he had less time to work, he was getting more done.\n\n“While I had less absolute time, I had more more in time in terms of focused work.”\n\nWith his schedule optimized, Jonathan decided it was time to optimize other parts of his workday for focus and motivation. By checking his Productivity Pulse, he already knew that his phone and social media (especially sites like Hacker News) were his biggest distraction.\n\n“When I came up against a problem in my work, I’d start scrolling and browsing. My phone became my default for when I was feeling uncomfortable.”\n\nWith RescueTime, Jonathan was able to rebuild his schedule around focus, claw back from burnout, and reduce his working hours while getting more done. But he didn’t use RescueTime just for this initial optimization, but also to help maintain his productivity day after day, and week after week.\n\n“In this age of distraction, being able to focus for a long period of time on a single task is a competitive advantage few people have. RescueTime helps me identify not just how I spend my time but also when I’m most likely to do my best work each day.”\n\nWhen you’re busy running your own company it’s easy to dream of having more time each day. But what if that’s the wrong dream? More time doesn’t equal more productivity. Instead of optimizing for more time, you should be focusing on efficiency.\n\nThis insight has been the driving force behind the many successes of Srinivas Rao — the author, founder, and host of The Unmistakable Creative podcast.\n\nIn the span of a few years, Srinivas went from the shackles of a 9–5 to launching his own company, interviewing hundreds of the world’s most productive and interesting entrepreneurs, and publishing multiple best-selling books. But re-wiring his brain (and his schedule) for focus didn’t come easily at first.\n\nHow Srinivas mastered his daily time and focus\n\nNo one wants to think they’re distracted, unmotivated, or wasting time. Yet few of us take the time to really understand how we spend our days. As Srinivas explains, only time-tracking will tell you the truth about how effective and focused you are.\n\n“RescueTime exists because we’re dealing with a world of problems that didn’t exist in the past. Nothing offers more clarity than putting a number in front of your goal. All of a sudden it’s very clear whether you accomplished it or not.”\n\nUsing RescueTime, Srinivas got a clear picture of how he was spending his time over days, weeks, and months. Not only did this show him negative aspects (like when he was being distracted) but also helped him identify his peak productive hours during the day.\n\nWith an overview of his most productive hours and worst distractions, Srinivas started to experiment and optimize his daily schedule.\n\nThe first step was to remove distractions. By looking at his daily Productivity Pulse and connecting it to his Distracting Time one of the first things he discovered was that using social media first thing in the morning led to less productive days.\n\n“If you log into Facebook first thing in the morning, every link you click on and every article you read is a decision that’s naturally eroding your willpower. If you start your day this way, you’re going to feel distracted all day long.”\n\nNext, he started to dig into the other seemingly “productive” tasks that were getting in the way of real focus. This meant looking at Time Spent on Email as well as in meetings.\n\n“Nobody ever changed the world by checking email, so it’s insane that we spend so much time on it.”\n\nSrinivas is a fan of ‘batching’ emails (dealing with them only during select times). And even writes his emails in a different app to avoid getting distracted by his inbox. RescueTime’s Communication report keeps him honest about how much time he spends in emails. And he can even set Daily Goals to track email and communication time.\n\nFinally, Srinivas realized that optimizing his focus wasn’t just about the time spent working, but also getting enough rest. But as an entrepreneur, it’s hard to say when you’ve done “enough” each day.\n\n“When it comes to productivity, there’s a law of diminishing returns where at a certain point, the output you’re going to get from your efforts, despite the same effort, is going to decrease.”\n\nUsing RescueTime’s Work Hours, you’re able to separate your data, goals, and alerts between when you want to be working and when you should be resting so you can optimize for both.\n\n“Downtime is often where we get the most ROI on our thinking.”\n\nWhen you’re running a business, time is money. And when it comes to being more efficient with your time, the right data guides you.\n\n“The greatest value of Rescuetime is awareness. Most people waste their time because they don’t know they’re spending it. Rescuetime is the wakeup call and reality check most people need when they’re struggling to manage their time and attention.”\n\nHow Colleen doubled her productivity without burning out\n\nAs a freelancer, you’re more than just a writer/designer/developer. You also have to be your personal admin/bookkeeper/marketer/and a whole whack of other roles. And if you’re not careful, those other tasks can take over your time.\n\nThe first thing Colleen noticed when she started looking through her RescueTime data was just how much time was spent not writing or drawing.\n\n“Before using RescueTime, I was very bad about tracking how much of my time was going into my art. I’d sink way too much time into admin tasks and have no energy left for writing and drawing! I was puttering, doing busywork, but the real work is art, that has to come first.”\n\nBy far, the biggest offender was social media. While Colleen uses her social accounts to talk to fans and promote her work, it was taking up way too much time in her day.\n\nBut by using her Time Spent on Social Media report, she was able to get a clear picture of just how much time it was taking up. And it was bad.\n\n“Until I began using RescueTime, I had no idea just how bad my social media overuse was. The reality of my habits was right there in my face and I was horrified.”\n\nShe quickly started to re-assess how she spent her time. First, this meant setting Goals and Alerts around her social media and writing time.\n\n“I love the RescueTime pop-ups that remind me of my goals. It makes me feel great to see my productivity going straight up—to see I’m getting better about managing things.”\n\nAs she slowly built up her productive time, she dug into her Trends to help track her progress over time.\n\n“The trends chart has been especially important for tracking my progress and seeing where I’m dipping and need to keep a lookout.”\n\nBy controlling the time she was spending on distractions and admin, Colleen was able to double her Productive Time in a matter of months. All without working more hours.\n\n“This summer, my Design and Composition hours dropped to only 67. I couldn’t focus and I felt terrible. A month later my Design and Composition hours jumped to 128 and then 160. More than double!”\n\nWith RescueTime, Colleen was able to counter the worst aspects of freelance life—the competing priorities, lack of guardrails, and potential for burnout. Instead of working more and feeling like she’s not hitting her goals, she’s built new habits that put her in control of her day.\n\n“In the time since I started using RescueTime I’ve gone from hours of social media use per day to about a half-hour. I can talk to my readers and promote projects without going overboard and using up all my creative mental energy before I even get to the drawing board!”\n\nHow Jonathan and Gary rebuilt their focus and broke bad habits\n\nLook up “time management tips for students” and you’ll be inundated with strategies for staying focused and motivated. However, as Jonathan explains, strategies only go so far:\n\n“I’ve definitely had trouble with being productive and avoiding procrastination in the past and ended up using lots of different tools and strategies, but it was never really clear what was having a real impact.”\n\nTo take action, experiment, and find the best time management strategies, you need to have an awareness of what works and what doesn’t. For both Gary and Jonathan, that meant using RescueTime’s automatic time tracking and productivity pulse to see where their time was actually going. As Jonathan explains:\n\n“With RescueTime, I can quickly see which activities or apps I’m spending the most time in to get a read on how productive (or not) I’m being.”\n\nOnce they had insight into their daily schedule and where their productivity was faltering, both students started to optimize their days. For Gary, this primarily meant setting a Goal for Daily Writing Time while he worked towards finishing his thesis.\n\n“At the moment, I’m spending an incredible amount of time writing up my Ph. D thesis and have goals for the number of hours I want to be spending on it each day so I can track my progress.”\n\nNot only does this help keep him accountable to his thesis work, but with Monthly Goal Tracking, Gary’s now able to see how productive he’s being on a daily basis as well as larger trends for his writing time.\n\n“It can be hard to keep yourself motivated if you’re not seeing any immediate results. But with RescueTime, I can review my data and know that I had a productive Monday, which sets me up for a good week. There’s motivation in just reviewing what you’ve done.”\n\nFor Jonathan, he was more concerned with tackling procrastination. With varying days and too many opportunities to get distracted, he needed to find ways to protect his focus.\n\n“I know that if I can start working on a task and get invested in it that it’s easy for me to spend 3–4 good productive hours on it. But getting over that initial procrastination is a struggle.”\n\nTo get over his procrastination, Jonathan set up an Alert to automatically start a 30-minute FocusTime session at the start of his day. This means all distractions are blocked as he starts working and gets focused on specific tasks.\n\nNot only that, but he uses a similar Alert for blocking distractions right after lunch to help protect his focus when his energy has naturally dipped. As he explains: “It’s a guardrail for me.”\n\nFor both students, RescueTime does something none of the other time management tools out there could: Give them both accurate insight into how they’re spending their time, and actionable advice and tools to help protect their focus, build better habits, and boost their productivity. As Gary says:\n\n“I didn’t realize how much time I was throwing down the drain just from small things like watching videos on YouTube. RescueTime gives me accuracy when it comes to knowing how I spend my time. I get a much more detailed picture of what I’m doing so I can make the changes I need to my schedule and habits.”",
      "# [Who We Are](https://www.rescuetime.com/about)\nRescueTime started when a few friends found themselves asking the same question at the end of every day: Where the h$^% does the time go?\n\nAfter putting in a long, hard day’s work, we were left wishing we had an extra hour (or two!) We couldn’t figure out where our time was going, so we built a tool that would tell us.\n\nWhat we discovered was that we were working hard, but not smart. Instead of long stretches of focused time, our days were spent bouncing between apps, websites, and tools without making any real progress on our goals.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how long you spend working if your attention and focus are gone. With RescueTime, we created a tool to help you take back control of your time so you can spend it on what matters most to you.",
      "# [RescueTime Terms of Service](https://www.rescuetime.com/tos)\n1. ACCEPTANCE\n\nRescueTime provides its service (”Service”) to you, subject to the following Terms of Service (”TOS”). The TOS tell you what you can expect from the Service, and what RescueTime expects of you. RescueTime may amend the TOS at any time by posting an amended TOS on our website.\n\n2. REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS\n\nYou must register for a membership in order to access the Service. When completing the registration form, you will provide true, accurate, and complete information, and maintain and promptly update this information. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, or incomplete, or RescueTime has reasonable grounds to suspect that the information is untrue, inaccurate, or incomplete, RescueTime has the right to suspend or terminate your membership and access to the Service. You are responsible for obtaining access to the Service, which access may involve third party fees (such as Internet service provider charges). In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the Service. You will enter a password and login name during the registration process. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and login name, and are responsible for all activities that occur with your password and login name, including fees incurred and all purchases made by your membership on the Service. This means that, unless your password and login name, or credit card information is obtained unlawfully or fraudulently, you will be responsible for all fees incurred and purchases made by your membership. You will immediately notify RescueTime of any unauthorized use of your membership or any other breach of security.\n\n3. MEMBERSHIP, FEES\n\nIndividuals may obtain a membership with the Service without paying a fee. RescueTime will charge fees to access certain components of the Service. If you must pay a fee to access a component of the Service, this information will be posted by RescueTime on the Service. You may use a credit card to pay these fees. When you use a credit card for payment, you represent to RescueTime that you are the authorized card holder. For recurring fees, RescueTime will charge your credit card each month. For one-time fees, RescueTime will charge your credit card once. RescueTime reserves the right to change its fees or billing methods. If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your membership, but RescueTime will not refund any fees that may have accrued to your membership before you cancel it. RescueTime may also charge you for any sales or use taxes to which the Service is subject.\n\n4. PROHIBITED USES\n\nYou agree that you will not:\n\nimpersonate any person, including a RescueTime employee or agent on the Service; violate any local, state, or national law through or on the Service; harass people through or on the Service; collect or store data about other people using the Service; use any device, software or routine to interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Service; take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on the infrastructure of the Service; use the Service in any manner other than as expressly authorized in the TOS; reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, or exploit for any commercial purposes, any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service.\n\n5. OWNERSHIP AND RESTRICTIONS\n\nThe license granted in these TOS does not constitute a transfer or sale of RescueTime’s ownership rights in the RescueTime Database. RescueTime retains all right, title, and interest in and to the RescueTime Database including all related intellectual property rights. You will use your best efforts to prevent and protect the contents of the RescueTime Database from unauthorized use or distribution. You must not rent, lease, sublicense, sell, assign, loan, distribute, transmit, or otherwise transfer any content of the service, including the RescueTime Database, or your rights and obligations pursuant to the TOS. You must not copy, reproduce, alter, modify, create derivative works, or publicly display any content of the Service, including the RescueTime Database, unless expressly authorized in the TOS.\n\n6. CHILDREN\n\nBy registering, installing, and accepting these TOS you represent to RescueTime that you are at least 13 years old. RescueTime’s policy is to prohibit children under the age of 13 from purchasing, accessing, registering, or using any of RescueTime’s products and services unless under the guidance, supervision and consent of their parents, guardians and/or authorized school officials. We rely on parents and guardians to ensure minors only use RescueTime products and services if they can understand their rights and responsibilities as stated in this TOS and our Privacy Policy.\n\nFor teachers or parents, if you want children under the age of 13 to create their own RescueTime accounts, then you (or your school) assume the responsibility for complying with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and, to the extent applicable, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”). This means you must notify childrens’ parents/guardians of the information to be collected and obtain parental/guardian consent before collecting and sharing with the RescueTime products and services the personal information of children under the age of 13 in order to establish an account or use the RescueTime products and service. Teachers may, under appropriate, circumstances provide such consent on behalf of parents/guardians. For more information on complying with COPPA, see the Federal Trade Commission’s website at http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm.\n\n7. RescueTime PRIVACY POLICY\n\nCertain registration information and other information about you may be collected by RescueTime and through the Service. RescueTime’s use of this information is governed by the RescueTime Privacy Policy.\n\n8. USER WARRANTY\n\nYou represent and warrant to RescueTime: (a) that you have full power, authority, and legal capacity to enter into the Agreements and follow its obligations, and if you are registering on behalf of a company or other entity, you have the authority to bind your principal or employer company; (b) you will provide complete and accurate information to RescueTime; and (c) you will pay all charges that you incur at RescueTime’s then-current rates.\n\n9. INDEMNITY\n\nYou will indemnify and hold RescueTime, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your use of the Service, your violation of the TOS, or your violation of any rights of a third party.\n\n10. MODIFICATIONS TO SERVICE\n\nRescueTime reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service or any part of it with or without notice. RescueTime will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Service.\n\n11. TERMINATION\n\nYou have the right to terminate or cancel your membership at any time. You understand and agree that the cancellation of your membership or a particular component of the Service is your sole right and remedy with respect to any dispute with RescueTime. This includes, but is not limited to, any dispute related to or arising out of: (a) any term of the TOS or RescueTime’s enforcement or application of the TOS; (b) any policy or practice of RescueTime, including the Privacy Policy, or RescueTime’s enforcement or application of these policies; (c) the data available through the Service; (d) your ability to access and use the Service; or (e) the amount or type of fees, surcharges, applicable taxes, and any RescueTime billing methods. RescueTime, in its sole discretion, may terminate your membership and remove and discard any of your Recommendations without notice if RescueTime believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the TOS. RescueTime will not be liable to you for termination of your membership to the Service. Sections 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16, and 17 will survive the termination of the TOS and your membership.\n\n12.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES\n\nYOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. RescueTime EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT RELATED TO THE SERVICE. ANY MATERIAL OR DATA DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICE IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LOSS OF DATA OR EMAIL THAT RESULTS FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM RescueTime OR THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE TOS. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.\n\n14. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n\nRescueTime WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF RescueTime HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL RescueTime’S TOTAL LIABILITY OF ALL KINDS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTY CLAIMS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORUM AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY ACTION OR CLAIM IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT OF FEES PAID BY YOU TO RescueTime IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACTION GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY, AND (B) $100. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THE TOS. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n15. TRADEMARK INFORMATION\n\nRescueTime, the RescueTime logo, and other RescueTime logos, products and service names are trademarks of RescueTime. You must not display or use them in any manner.\n\n16. ARBITRATION\n\nAny legal controversy or legal claim arising out of or relating to the TOS or the Service, excluding legal action taken by RescueTime to collect fees or recover damages for, or obtain an injunction relating to, RescueTime’s intellectual property or the Service, will be settled by binding and final arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any controversy or claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis, and will not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. The arbitration will be conducted in King County, Washington, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered into any court having jurisdiction. Either you or RescueTime may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in King County, Washington necessary to protect the rights or property of you or RescueTime pending the completion of arbitration. Should either party file an action contrary to this provision, the other party may recover attorney’s fees and costs up to $1000.00.\n\n17. GENERAL INFORMATION\n\nRescueTime may provide notices to you pursuant to the TOS through email, regular mail, or by displaying conspicuous notices or links to notices to you on the Service. The TOS constitutes the entire agreement between you and RescueTime and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and RescueTime. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use other RescueTime products or services. The TOS and the relationship between you and RescueTime will be governed by the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You consent to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in King County, Washington. The failure of RescueTime to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS will not constitute a waiver of the right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found to be invalid, the other provisions of the TOS will remain in full force and effect. Any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.",

      "# [Privacy Policy](https://www.rescuetime.com/rtx/privacy)\nMost recent version: July 10, 2023.\n\nBy using RescueTime, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your personal information for the purposes of providing you our product services as described below. We will notify all active accounts of any significant changes to this policy.\n\nYour data is never shared\n\nYour privacy is really important to us. At RescueTime, your data, analyzed, is the product we offer back to you. We are not an ad supported company. Our free service is intended to entice you to premium service. If you have any concerns that aren't covered here, please contact us. Below are the details of this policy:\n\nWe will never sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal information, with or without personally identifying information. Furthermore, we will never share anonymized selections of your individual data. That includes any government (foreign or domestic) unless we are compelled by law. If we are required by law to disclose any of the information collected about you, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email. We will independently object to overly broad requests for access to information about users of our site.\n\nWe may share information about user behavior in the aggregate only. For example, we could share information like, \"which day of the week do people spend the most time in front of their computer?\" This type of analysis is used to enrich the product, and to represent our domain expertise to our audiences.\n\nYou can delete your data at any time — all of it, or just a slice of it. You can also delete your account at any time. Deleting your account deletes all your data from our database.\n\nWe won't spam you, ever, either directly or indirectly by sharing of email information. We might occasionally send one-time messages about important RescueTime news. We will likely continue to introduce ways that you can optionally have RescueTime contact you with data that you care about, but you will always be able to turn this on or off.\n\nFor individual accounts, no other user can see any of your data or personal information. We may provide features to allow you to share selections of your data, but this will be voluntary and opt-in only, and handled per-situation, and not buried in a terms of service.\n\nFor team accounts, sharing of data is controlled by the administrator of the account and by default does not allow anyone in the team account access to your data. No one outside of your organization will have access to any of your data. Default team implementations do not permit the sharing of individual data in any form that is not aggregated (eg, your team's average communication per week). When consulting with team implementations, we promote transparency and user driven control.\n\nHow do we protect your data?\n\nYour data is always encrypted in transit. All requests with the RescueTime web app and client apps are encrypted with current best practice SSL configurations.\n\nYour data is always encrypted at rest. All of our storage uses volume encryption.\n\nWe maintain ongoing vulnerability scanning, respond immediately to security advisories, and stay PCI compliant.\n\nWhat information does RescueTime collect? How is it used?\n\nAccount information includes email address (verification optional), city, state, and country. Optional demographic information includes gender, date of birth, industry, job title, company size, and income may be requested, to enrich the accuracy of our reporting for your work patterns.\n\nRescueTime records information about the currently active application or website on your computer. We record for processing the following information: 1) for time analysis: application name, web site URL, window title, start time of use, end time of use and 2) for distinguishing you and your device: device login name (your system user name), device name, device operating system version, and sometimes the manufacturer. For some inputs, the public internet address you are operating from is saved, for your security (and ours), and for troubleshooting. Like all activity information, it is discarded with account deletion.\n\nWe do not (and never will) collect keystrokes, form input, screenshots, window or page body content, or anything nefarious. Before storage for your reports, URLs are trimmed to the site name and sometimes top level directory when a site has distinct web apps. Query strings are discarded. Site controls allow you to selectively delete and ignore forever any item you prefer not be stored.\n\nHow long is your data retained?\n\nAll your data is destroyed in its entirety when you delete your account, except account activity logs required for business audit records. This process can take up to 3 days to protect against accidental deletion. Users can request immediate deletion by contacting support.\n\nYou can delete your own data at any time on our website in the Data & Privacy section of account settings.\n\nFree account user data older than 15 months is automatically deleted on a continuous basis.\n\nCookies and Log Files\n\nRescueTime.com sends a \"cookie\" to your computer that contains an identifier that is unique to your browser session. We use this cookie to validate your authentication, provide you with a continuous experience, and to record how our site/service is being used. It is not used for marketing purposes.\n\nAs is done with most web sites, we log each visit to each web page. A log entry can contain information typically found in the \"header\" of your web browser's request such as the browser type you used, your Internet Protocol address, and the date and time of day. We may also log your session identifier and the URL of a site that referred you. This log information is important for security, audit, quality improvement, as well as for monitoring the health of our service.",
      "# [RescueTime API Documentation](https://www.rescuetime.com/rtx/developers)\nConnecting to the RescueTime API\n\nThere are two ways to connect to a user’s data in RescueTime, via API Keys or via an Oauth2 Connection. The API keys are ideal for personal use, while web services wishing to offer a way for their users to use their RescueTime data should use an Oauth2 connection.\n\nAPI Key Access:\n\nUsers can set up an API key by going to their key management page and creating a new key. That key must be included with each API request. The user can revoke keys at any time.\n\nOauth2 Connection Access:\n\nPlease contact us and we’ll work with you to set up an Oauth2 application. After the user connects their account via Oauth2, an access token will be created. That access token must be included in each API request. The user can revoke access to a service at any time.\n\nOauth2 Authorization Flow\n\nOnce we have created your Oauth2 application, your app will be assigned a client_id and a client_secret. These tokens can then be used, along with the secure redirect_uri provided in the request for an oauth application, in the following steps to authorize your application's user access to their RescueTime data:\n\nA GET request to the following URL:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&response_type=code&scope=YOUR_SCOPES\n\nThis will return the auth_code, which will expire in 10 minutes.\n\nA POST request to the following URL:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/oauth/token\n\nwith a JSON body of:\n\n{\n\n\"client_id\": YOUR_CLIENT_ID,\n\n\"client_secret\": YOUR_APP_SECRET,\n\n\"grant_type\": \"authorization_code\",\n\n\"code\": AUTH_CODE,\n\n\"redirect_uri\": YOUR_REDIRECT_URI\n\n}\n\nThis will return the access_token\n\nData can then be accessed with the access_token, as shown in this example URL:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/data?access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN&by=interval&taxonomy=productivity&interval=hour&restrict_begin=2018-01-01&restrict_end=2018-01-31&format=json&scopes=time_data\n\nOauth2 Access Scopes\n\nWhen users connect their accounts to your application via Oauth2, you can specify access scopes to let the user know exactly how you will be using their RescueTime data. Scopes will be requested during the initial authorization request.\n\nThe following scopes are currently supported:\n\ntime_data: Access activity history and summary time data or post offline time for the authorized user\n\ncategory_data: Access how much time the authorizing user spent in specific categories\n\nproductivity_data: Access how much time the authorizing user spent in different productivity levels\n\nalert_data: Access the authorizing user's alert history\n\nhighlight_data: Read from and post to the authorizing user's daily highlights list\n\nfocustime_data: Access the authorizing user's Focus Session history and session starting and stopping\n\nAPI Endpoints\n\nThere are several API endpoints that can be used to access different types of data within RescueTime.\n\nAnalytic Data API:\n\nThe Analytic Data API is targeted at bringing developers the prepared and pre-organized data structures already familiar through the reporting views of www.rescuetime.com.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Analytic Data API\n\nDaily Summary Feed API:\n\nThe Daily Summary Feed API provides a structured rollup of daily data about the time logged by a user. This data includes: total time logged, time logged at each productivity level, average productivity pulse, and the time spent in each major category.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Daily Summary Feed API\n\nAlerts Feed API:\n\nThe Alerts Feed API provides a feed of recent occurrences of user-defined alerts. It is a good way to let users define aspects of their data that they care about (“I want to spend more than 5 hours per day on All Productive Time”, for example) and then use that data in an external service.\n\nNote: Alerts are a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return empty results for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Alerts Feed API\n\nHighlights Feed API:\n\nThe Highlights Feed API provides a feed of recently entered daily highlights.\n\nNote: Highlights are a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return empty results for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Highlights Feed API\n\nHighlights POST API:\n\nThe Highlights POST API allows users to post a daily highlight entry programatically. An example use case is posting a new highlight whenever a software developer makes a new check-in to their GIT repository.\n\nNote: Highlights are a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return a 400 response for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Highlights Post API\n\nFocus Session Trigger API:\n\nThe Focus Session Trigger API allows users to start Focus Session on their active devices programatically.\n\nNote: Focus Session is a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return a 400 response for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Focus Session Trigger API\n\nFocus Session Feed API:\n\nThe Focus Session Feed API provides a feed of recent Focus Session \"started\" or Focus Session \"ended\" events. An example use case would be to set a chat application status to \"away\" when a new Focus Session started event has been detected.\n\nNote: Focus Sessions are a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return a 400 response for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Focus Session Feed API\n\nOffline Time POST API:\n\nThe Offline Time POST API allows users to post offline time to their account programmatically. An example use case would be to post offline time based on localtion data or meeting times.\n\nNote: Offline Time is a feature of RescueTime premium. This API will return a 400 response for non-premium users.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Offline Time Post API\n\nDocumentation for the Analytic Data API\n\nRescueTime data is detailed and complicated. The Analytic Data API is targeted at bringing developers the prepared and pre-organized data structures already familiar through the reporting views of www.rescuetime.com. The data is read-only through the webservice, but you can perform any manipulations on the consumer side you want. Keep in mind this is a draft interface, and may change in the future. We do intend to version the interfaces though, so it is likely forward compatible.\n\nThe Analytic Data API allows for parameterized access, which means you can change the subject and scope of data, and is especially targeted for developer use. The data can be accessed via the HTTP Query interface in several formats.\n\nThe Analytic Data API is presented as a read-only resource accessed by simple GET HTTP queries. This provides maximum flexibility with minimal complexity; you can use the provided API tools, or just research the documented parameters and construct your own queries.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach this HTTP query API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key: https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/data\n\nFor Oauth2 connections:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/data - This is the least restritive url and requires the time_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRestricted Report: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/overview_data - This url will restricts the output to top level category data only and requires the category_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRestricted Report: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/category_data - This url will restricts the output to sub-category data only and requires the category_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRestricted Report: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/productivity_data - This url will restricts the output to productivity data only and requires the productivity_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nAbout restricted reports: Restricted reports may be useful if your application requires a less-granular rollup of the data, such as the category view, but NOT the actual activities themselves. These restricted reports help ensure the user’s privacy, and may be a preferable option when asking them to link their accounts.\n\nRequired parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nformat - [ 'csv' | 'json' ]\n\nQuery Parameters\n\nPrimary names are chosen for human reading. The short names are for when GET query length is at a premium. The alias is for understanding roughly how it maps into the language used in reporting views, and our own internal nicknames.\n\nPrinciple name Short Alias Short Values Description perspectivepvbyby [ 'rank' | 'interval' ]\n\nConsider this the X - axis of the returned data.

In an interval report, the X axis unit. In other words, data is summarizd into chunks of this size. \"minute\" will return data grouped into five-minute buckets, which is the most granular view available.\n\nrestrict_beginrb date\n\nSets the start day for data batch, inclusive (always at time 00:00, start hour/minute not supported)\n\nFormat ISO 8601 \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n\nrestrict_endre date\n\nSets the end day for data batch, inclusive (always at time 00:00, end hour/minute not supported)\n\nFormat ISO 8601 \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n\nrestrict_kindrktaxonomyty [ 'category' | 'activity' | 'productivity' | 'document' ]\n\n('efficiency' is option when perspective is 'interval')\n\nAllows you to preprocess data through different statistical engines.

This is useful for generating notifications that don’t need to be real-time and don’t require much granularity (for greater precision or more timely alerts, see the Alerts Feed API). This can be used to construct a customized daily progress report delivered via email. The summary can also be used to alert people to specific conditions. For example, if a user has more than 20% of their time labeled as ‘uncategorized’, that can be used to offer people a message to update their categorizations on the website.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The Daily Summary Feed is ‘point in time‘ data - use the data api or export CSVs from reports if you want your latest categorization results.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach this Daily Summary Feed API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key: https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/daily_summary_feed\n\nFor Oauth2 connections: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/daily_summary_feed\n\nRequired parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nOutput Format\n\nThe Daily Summary Feed API returns an array of JSON objects representing rollup information for each day logged by the user in the previous two weeks.

Alerts are a premium feature and as such the API will always return zero results for users on the RescueTime Lite plan.\n\nService Access\n\nThe base URL to reach the Alerts Feed API is:\n\nFor connections with an API key: https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/alerts_feed\n\nFor Oauth2 connections: https://www.rescuetime.com/api/oauth/alerts_feed - Requires the alert_data access scope to be granted by the user when the Oauth2 connection is initially set up.\n\nRequired parameters\n\nkey - [ Your API key ] OR access_token - [ the access token from the Oauth2 Connection ]\n\nop - [ status | list ]\n\nThe op parameter determines what type of information about the alerts is returned. Passing op=list will return a definition list of all the alerts currently defined by the user. This is useful for presenting a list of the user's alerts to allow the user to select an alert_id value that will be used to filter subsequent queries.\n\nPassing op a value of status is the default, and will return a list of recently triggered alerts in reverse-chronological order.\n\nOptional parameters\n\nalert_id - [ Integer ID of an alert to filter on ]\n\nOutput Format\n\nWhen passing op=list, The Alerts Feed API will return an array of JSON objects representing the currently active alerts that the user has defined.

This should be in the format of ‘YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS’, but a unix timestamp is also acceptable.\n\nend_time/duration - Either a string representing the date/time the for the end of the offline time block, OR an integer representing the duration of the offline time block in minutes.\n\nactivity_name - A 255 character or shorter string containing the text that will be entered as the name of the activity (e.g. \"Meeting\", \"Driving\", \"Sleeping\", etc).\n\nOptional JSON keys/values\n\nactivity_details - A 255 character or shorter string containing the text that will be entered as the details of the named activity.\n\nOutput Format\n\nA successful post will return at status code of 200. If there is an error, a status code of 400 will be returned.\n\nExample Requests\n\nTo post offline time about a meeting that just ended:\n\nA POST request to the following URL:\n\nhttps://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/offline_time_post?key=YOUR_API_KEY\n\nwith a JSON body of:\n\n{\n\n\"start_time\": \"2020-01-01 09:00:00\",\n\n\"duration\": 60,\n\n\"activity_name\": \"Meeting\",\n\n\"activity_details\": \"Daily Planning\"\n\n}\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\nWhen you enable access to your data, you generate a key that is saved in RescueTime's system. Essentially, this key provides an alternative read-only authentication to your data. You can keep this key private, in which case it's just as safe as your login and password, or publish it, without exposing your account to other access or risks beyond the scope of the data.\n\nWe assume data api access is being requested for use on the server side of things, presumably in some code of your own. In this case, you can protect the key as you would any other server side secret. It would never be seen in the browser, but used by your application to retrieve data from us then process and render yourself somehow. So in this case, the key provides read-only access to your data by arbitrary scope (within limits) through parameters.\n\nAs a user, you can revoke access to keys you have created by going to your Key Management Page. Any applications you have connected to via an Oauth2 connection, can be revoked by going to your connected applications page.",

Users download a desktop application from RescueTime that does all the tracking work.\r\nThere is no data entry needed from the user's perspective.  The application keeps track of which window is \"in focus\" when you are on your computer, and logs what activity you are doing and for how long you are doing it.  The application also has an idle timer so if you step away from your computer RescueTime does not inflate the amount of time you spent on a given activity.\n\n- [Website](http://rescuetime.com)\n- [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/company/rescuetime)\n- [Twitter](http://twitter.com/rescuetime)\n\n## Funding (0M USD total)\n\n- 0M USD on 2008-09-23\n- 0M USD on 2007-10-14\n\n## News\n\n- Meta's Latest Game-changer: Whatsapp Flows and the Future of Conversational Shopping Experiences ([markets.businessinsider.com, 2024-03-04](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/meta-s-latest-game-changer-whatsapp-flows-and-the-future-of-conversational-shopping-experiences-1033077938))\n- 4 digital payment trends to look out for in 2021 ([Lorena Torres, 2021-01-25](https://latamlist.com/?p=8622))\n- How MoEngage, powered by AWS, is processing 1 trillion data points monthly to drive insight-led customer engagement ([Team YS, 2020-11-14](https://yourstory.com/2020/11/moengage-powered-aws-trillion-data-points-drive-customer-engagement))\n- The Best Free Google Chrome Extensions ([Eric Griffith, 2020-07-16](https://trib.al/7Z70yOL))\n- Remote work and the screen-time debate ([Megan Jenkins, 2020-05-28](https://medium.com/cgo-benchmark/remote-work-and-the-screen-time-debate-de620d4a48ad))\n- Paint Your Roam with Custom CSS ([maggieappleton.com, 2020-05-23](http://maggieappleton.com/paintingroam))\n- 6 Tools You Can Use to Improve Time Management Skills ([IntelligentHQ, 2020-05-22](https://bit.ly/2WWwaB7))\n- What I learned when I experimented with turning on notifications for a month ([Daniel Rose—RescueTime, 2019-11-08](https://www.fastcompany.com/90428031/what-one-writer-learned-when-he-turned-on-all-notifications))\n- RescueTime ([ZD Net, 2019-05-26](https://downloads.zdnet.com/product/20418-78073285/))\n- You can be much more productive.

It would have saved me some time frustration if the app description had just said that, or at least said it when I opened the app. Unless something has changed? I’d love to actually use this app. I used it probably 10 years ago, and loved it. I even paid for it for quite a while. Now I’m trying to reduce my streaming time, so I was wanting to use the basic features again.\nI do all my streaming on my iPad, so if RescueTime can’t track app usage here, then this won’t work for me.\n\nBefore I read that this won’t work on my iPad, when I installed this app and created a new account with my new email and signed in, it only let me choose between the 2 paid versions. There was no way to select the free version.\n\nSo that’s not a great user interface on both counts. This has all just been a waste of time.",

Once I had some broad idea about where my time was utilized I then relabeled the facets for more specific items. The time slip does have some quirks that I had to get used to but overall I am happy with the purchase and with the information it’s giving me.\n\n### Comment ID j5kknbi with +1 score by [(just-a-d-j, Reddit, 2023-01-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/yjt1wh/time_tracking_apps/j5kknbi/) (in reply to ID iuq1jgy):\nI feel like i’m the opposite kind of user but i’m thinking timeflip might work for me … I don’t need to bill/ track my time but im trying to JUSTIFY my time spent and I want to use some physical divide so when I keep getting pulled into these projects i can start my timer for that activity and then show my managers at the end “this is how much time I spent this week doing xyz” I can’t find a lot of reviews online so do you think timeflip would work for this use case?\n\n#### Comment ID jpm7yqx with +2 score by [(Mattyreed1, Reddit, 2023-06-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/yjt1wh/time_tracking_apps/jpm7yqx/) (in reply to ID j5kknbi):\nI feel like there are better ways to do this than carrying around a cube...

Now I’m trying to reduce my streaming time, so I was wanting to use the basic features again.\nI do all my streaming on my iPad, so if RescueTime can’t track app usage here, then this won’t work for me.\n\nBefore I read that this won’t work on my iPad, when I installed this app and created a new account with my new email and signed in, it only let me choose between the 2 paid versions. There was no way to select the free version.\n\nSo that’s not a great user interface on both counts. This has all just been a waste of time.",

Enterprise ready competitors are price gauging your opportunities and offering more robust technology that meets modern SaaS use-case scenarios. \n\nMiddle management is filled with projects that could be executed around actually customer and employee needs and employees in the Sales and marketing departments are more than aware of pain-points that causing their day-to-day to become increasingly difficult as Covid prevention and back to office work becomes more prevalent. Evolve to meet the true needs of your customers.",

          "cons": "Although the above information couldn’t be more true - this company needs serious help on meeting the standards of it’s employees and clients. \n\nThe leadership structure is still very much linear - like a mom and pop/lifestyle brand , where anything that jeopardizes the core of their internal processes/revenue generation; is put on direct standstill. \n\nSince the inception of the coronavirus pandemic, business in late-2020 was positively impacted - however - changes to the development of the product or real-time changes based on user feedback, did not happen. Former competitors took advantage of this and reduced their monthly and annual pricing agreements - while offering the same technology that Time Doctor had been known to have for the longest time in this SaaS space. Now current integrations offer time tracking reports as an extension of their product suite - or even free - and revenues are hurting because of this. \n\nFeedback on the reduction of macros has led to C-Level leadership making shorthanded decisions that directly impact employees and their compensation, as well as, the end-users of the platform (consistent changes in their pricing agreements and product offerings based on tiers). \n\nThe direction of change does not equate to the customers needs - nor does leadership ask the end-users for their feedback. Middle management and their amazing ideas for changes based on client and employee feedback is lengthened due to this leadership structure. \n\nSpecial projects that impact company growth are “A/B tested” for a considerable amount of time, until they are ignored. Sales and Revenue generation is left to two outlets of opportunity generation - third party webinars not hosted by the organization internally & the free trial that is always “glowing” for access on the homepage. \n\nIt is sad to see so many talented and truly GOOD people become frustrated with their day to day and become overall disinterested with the value proposition that the product offers. The creative aesthetic of middle management depreciates every day, due to this.",

Enterprise ready competitors are price gauging your opportunities and offering more robust technology that meets modern SaaS use-case scenarios. \n\nMiddle management is filled with projects that could be executed around actually customer and employee needs and employees in the Sales and marketing departments are more than aware of pain-points that causing their day-to-day to become increasingly difficult as Covid prevention and back to office work becomes more prevalent. Evolve to meet the true needs of your customers.",
        "cons": "Although the above information couldn’t be more true - this company needs serious help on meeting the standards of it’s employees and clients. \n\nThe leadership structure is still very much linear - like a mom and pop/lifestyle brand , where anything that jeopardizes the core of their internal processes/revenue generation; is put on direct standstill. \n\nSince the inception of the coronavirus pandemic, business in late-2020 was positively impacted - however - changes to the development of the product or real-time changes based on user feedback, did not happen. Former competitors took advantage of this and reduced their monthly and annual pricing agreements - while offering the same technology that Time Doctor had been known to have for the longest time in this SaaS space. Now current integrations offer time tracking reports as an extension of their product suite - or even free - and revenues are hurting because of this. \n\nFeedback on the reduction of macros has led to C-Level leadership making shorthanded decisions that directly impact employees and their compensation, as well as, the end-users of the platform (consistent changes in their pricing agreements and product offerings based on tiers). \n\nThe direction of change does not equate to the customers needs - nor does leadership ask the end-users for their feedback. Middle management and their amazing ideas for changes based on client and employee feedback is lengthened due to this leadership structure. \n\nSpecial projects that impact company growth are “A/B tested” for a considerable amount of time, until they are ignored. Sales and Revenue generation is left to two outlets of opportunity generation - third party webinars not hosted by the organization internally & the free trial that is always “glowing” for access on the homepage. \n\nIt is sad to see so many talented and truly GOOD people become frustrated with their day to day and become overall disinterested with the value proposition that the product offers. The creative aesthetic of middle management depreciates every day, due to this.",

Middle Management is open to exploring staff’s creative input and the company is currently hiring for various roles to meet the expectations of the Development team.",

Team members may worry about being \"spied on\". The best ways to address any concerns is to show potential team members what data is available in the reports and to remind them that RescueTime is not designed to be employee monitoring software. It is both a tool to help managers make smart choices about the overall team time-management strategy and a source of valuable information for the individuals on the team.\n\nIndividual data is not accessible in the group reports\n\nThe group reports only contain anonymized, aggregated information about how the team as a whole is spending its time. A manager cannot view an individual's private details or activities. Group time is aggregated, and in most cases rolled up to the category level. Key Tools are the only activities that will be displayed explicitly in team reports. This helps ensure the privacy of your team members and cuts down on a lot of noise that would make your reports less oriented toward the goal of increasing productivity as a team.\n\nAccessing Team Settings\n\nTeam settings are found in the drop down menu under the Tools icon:\n\nAccessing the group reports\n\nYou can access the group reports by clicking Reports in the top navigation, and choose Your Team:\n\nSummary Report\n\nThe summary report gives a high-level overview of how your team is spending its time. You will be able to see the total time logged for the team, the time by day, top categories and key tools, and a breakdown of patterns throughout the day. You can adjust the date and time frame using the date controls at the top of the page. You can also view time by day, week, month, or year.\n\nCategories Report\n\nThe categories report shows a detailed analysis of how time is spent across different categories. For the selected period you can see the total time in each category as well as a breakdown of how that time was spent during particular hours, days or weeks.\n\nKey Tools Report\n\nThe Key Tools report shows a detailed breakdown of how time is spent in the different key tools you have configured. For the selected period, you can see the total time in each key tool as well as a breakdown of how that time was spent across hours, days, or weeks. You can configure your key tools on the Tracking Settings page: https://www.rescuetime.com/sponsors/tracking_settings\n\nPlease note: As owner or administrator, you would set up the categories for the Key Tool activities for your team. However, your team member can change this category in their own reports. This will not alter the team reports. Suppose your team member decides to change a category in their own reports. In that case, this time will still be accounted for and applied to the category you originally set for the Key Tool activity and therefore be included in the team reports.\n\nDid this answer your question?

      "# [Honest RescueTime Review by a Competitor by Jibble.io on 2023-12-09](https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime)\nBy Asim Qureshi, CEO Jibble\n\nAs a CEO of a time tracking software company I need to know what my competitors are up to. That means my team and I are often researching about and/or playing around with their products, you know, it’s part of the job. Here, I share my findings of that research, giving credit to those competitors where credit is due and being honest about which products I believe you really need to avoid. And so, there you have it, this review, and in it, I try to be honest, fair, and insightful. I hope it helps you make the right decision…\n\nThis Review Covers:\n\nOverview\n\nWhat Do Users Like About RescueTime?\n\nWhat Don’t Users Like About RescueTime?\n\nWhat Pricing Plans Does RescueTime Offer?\n\nWhat are the Standout Features of RescueTime?\n\nSelected Positive User Feedback\n\nSelected Negative User Feedback\n\nWhat are RescueTime’s Review Ratings from Review Sites?\n\nWhat’s My Final Verdict on RescueTime?\n\nOverview\n\nRescueTime is an award-winning software marketed as a productivity assistant that records computer and device usage habits. It touts time tracking combined with intuitive analysis of activities that don’t require any manual input from users.\n\nRescueTime automatically tracks time and activities from a user’s device. The data gathered by the software is organized into reports that detail how the time has been used on sites visited, files opened, and the apps and programs used the entire day.\n\nMy favorite feature is called FocusTime, which blocks all the websites classified by the user as personal or distracting, guarding your digital workspace from social media, entertainment, and other things that might creep up unnoticed, stealing time away from the things that matter.\n\nWhile the software does work well as a time tracking and activity analysis software, it lacks some very important features commonly present in other software marketed as productivity assistants.\n\nRescueTime does not offer workforce management tools such as cost calculation, invoicing, geolocation, and other features that limit its use to mostly personal goal-chasing. While it is a valuable productivity enhancement tool, it is not a work management and productivity solution for freelancers and businesses who need more than just the analytics that RescueTime provides.\n\nAside from these limitations, RescueTime doesn’t do quite well on mobile. Users have encountered bugs that have led to loss of tracked data, or the app simply doesn’t work and data doesn’t get tracked.\n\nWhat Do Users Like About RescueTime?\n\nAutomatic and unobtrusive tracking\n\nExcellent productivity analysis\n\nGreat for reducing distractions\n\nFind more on what users love about RescueTime.\n\nWhat Don't Users Like about RescueTime?\n\nMobile app needs some improvement\n\nUI needs improvements\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\nFind more on what users hate about RescueTime.\n\nWhat Pricing Plans Does RescueTime Offer?\n\nRescueTime has two plan variants: RescueTime Lite and RescueTime Premium.\n\nLite\n\nRescueTime Lite is free and is intended to cover the basics of time management and analysis.\n\nWith this plan, users get a personalized daily Focus Work goal, real-time tracking of daily goals and access to yesterday’s results, weekly reports of activities, goals and distractions, and timely alerts to improve habits.\n\nPremium\n\nRescueTime Premium is a paid plan that costs $12 monthly or $78 annually.\n\nWith this plan, users get all RescueTime Lite features, plus Focus sessions to block distractions, calendar integrations to schedule Focus Sessions, one-click entry into meetings, meeting tracking, morning outlook with Focus Zone forecasting, history reports with date controls and spreadsheet export, and weekly and monthly progress tracking.\n\nIf we compare RescueTime Premium’s price to similar software with project management and other administration capabilities at similar price points, I can’t help but feel that they are charging so much for so little.\n\nRead 5 things you MUST know about RescueTime’s pricing.\n\nWhat are the Standout Features of RescueTime?\n\n1. FocusTime\n\nFocusTime blocks out websites that the user has pre-defined as Personal or Distractions for a duration of time set by the user. You can start a FocusTime session by selecting the Get Focused option from the desktop app, accessed by clicking on the RescueTime icon on the menu bar or system tray.\n\nYou can also start FocusTime through calendar events, where it will start automatically at the time the entry is set. Users can set up an automatic Focus Session, by having it automatically start when you have spent a user-set amount of time on personal activities.\n\nDuring FocusTime when you go to a website you listed as Personal or a Distraction, you’ll be met with a FocusTime block page. You can choose to continue to the site, rescore it to Other Work, or continue to focus.\n\nWhen a user enters into a Focus Session, all their devices connected to their RescueTime account will automatically be in focus session as well.\n\n2. Comprehensive Activity Tracking\n\nRescueTime automatically tracks all computer activity 12 to 24 hours after it is installed. It doesn’t require users to clock in or switch tasks on a dashboard every time something new is being started, except during Focus Sessions.\n\nWorking in the background, RescueTime records every website and application users open or use during user-determined periods of tracking. It can be configured to collect full window titles, document titles, and URLs for more transparent activity monitoring.\n\nUsers also have the option to specify which sites and programs should be tracked via a whitelist on the Monitoring Options page. This means that site-specific data from whitelisted sites are recorded as usual, but activities on non-whitelisted sites are recorded merely as general browsing.\n\nThe Goals feature encourages users to help improve their habits by analyzing tracked data and creating actionable plans from it. Focus Work Goals take into consideration their meeting schedules and personal information to create — and meet — realistic milestones.\n\n3. Productivity Pulse\n\nRescueTime’s Productivity Pulse is a productivity meter that calculates the score across a time period on a donut graph that displays productivity points out of a hundred a user accumulates according to their time usage.\n\nThe score is calculated as the time-weighted average of the five different categories of activities previously discussed, ranging from Focus Work Time to Distracting Time.\n\nThis feature provides an easily understandable representation of time utilization and is helpful when users need to quickly check their productivity score or to keep track of progress and set up scores to beat. Having a number to surpass is a cool way of motivating users to do better; RescueTime’s Productivity Pulse provides just the challenge to keep them on fire.\n\nSelected Positive User Feedback:\n\n“Its the best app which helps me to set goals and also in time tracking. It has the feature of automatic time tracking which helps us to understand the hours we worked.” – Verified User in Accounting (Source G2)\n\n“One of the most useful aspects of RescueTime is its ability to automatically track the time I spend on different apps and websites without the need for manual intervention. This helps me get an accurate and objective picture of my work day without extra effort, the biggest time savings I have is with these features.” – Verified Reviewer (Source Capterra)\n\n“This tool for our team has been an eye-opening tool for tracking and improving productivity. Its automatic time tracking feature helps users understand how they spend their time on the computer and mobile devices..” – Fernando L. (Source Capterra)\n\n“The best thing about RescueTime is how after setup you simply forget about it. It works 100% without interaction and at the end of each day you have a comprehensive report on all the activities you performed.” – Lucas P. (Source Capterra)\n\n“The ease of use is the best of that tool. Without having to remember to start a task or something, it silently records what you are doing in the background.” – Christian H. (Source Capterra)\n\nSelected Negative User Feedback:\n\n“Can’t use with 2fa, which is insane. RescueTime carries sensitive data that tracks everything I do, so I’m incredulous that they don’t provide the barest of protections for that data.” – T.D. Eastvold (Source Google Play)\n\n“The phone app looks very dated and needs a big UI upgrade, the web app is very nice and informative, I really wish the app could replicate what the web app can do.” – Dinerty (Source Google Play)\n\n“If it works, this app is great. But most of the time it’s busy freezing, crashing or simply not tracking any app activity. ” – Eric (Source Google Play)\n\n“Would like to see better integration between the mobile app and the Windows app, for example, focus times could force the same Android actions automagically. ” – Geoffrey T. (Source G2)\n\n“It collects all the data and sends storage to its server. I often worry about the data privacy issues with this software, Have to evaluate the tradeoff.” – Tom V. (Source G2)\n\nWhat are RescueTime's Review Ratings from Review Sites?\n\n(As of October 2024)\n\nCapterra: 4.6/5\n\nG2: 4.1/5\n\nSoftware Advice: 4.5/5\n\nTrustRadius: 7.9/10\n\nGoogle Play Store: 4.1/5\n\nApp Store: 2.0/5\n\nWhat's My Final Verdict on RescueTime?\n\nRescueTime is a great time management and productivity-boosting tool that lives up to its name by helping users take back their time from unproductive practices and habits that they may not even know they have.\n\nIt holds up a clear and truthful mirror to users by faithfully logging all activities from the moment their work day begins to the moment it ends. The data gathered from tracking activities across periods are organized into user-defined categories that rank them on a five-point scale of productivity, from very productive to very distracting.\n\nThis allows users to reflect on their time utilization and adjust their practices as needed. Over time, RescueTime helps users build healthy productivity habits.Having said that, I would like to clarify that RescueTime is not a replacement for traditional project management tools, as it lacks many important features that other similar time tracking software provide for similar pricing.\n\nIt does not have any shift scheduling capabilities, billing and invoicing features, project progress tracking tools, and accountability safeguards, among others. And while it does provide very detailed analytics, too many numbers and report variants may just prove to be too much for users looking for simpler and to-the-point reporting.\n\nOther issues that caught my attention are the usual bugs, glitches, and crashes, some very much-needed tweaking in the mobile apps to address less-than-desirable mobile experiences, and stronger assurances that users’ privacy would not be compromised by its all-encompassing activity tracking.\n\nTo sum it all up, I’d say that you should definitely get RescueTime if you want to really understand where your time goes, and want to become more productive and develop a healthier work-life balance but don’t know where to begin.\n\nBut if you are looking for a more capable and traditional time tracking and project management tool, look elsewhere as RescueTime is not that.",
      "# [Monitoring Options on 2024-05-31](https://help.rescuetime.com/article/45-monitoring-options)\nRescueTime offers a wide variety of monitoring options, which can be accessed by navigating to the Privacy page under Account Settings > Data & Privacy\n\nLogging Details\n\nYou can choose whether RescueTime collects full window titles and document information for applications as well as choose the activity details for email programs.\n\nOnly Monitor Specific Websites\n\nBy default, RescueTime monitors all websites and all applications that you use.\n\nTo monitor only specific websites you would toggle the Monitor all websites option off and then click on the Manage Whitelist link.\n\nYou can choose to limit which sites are monitored. This \"whitelist\" will be pushed to your computer, effectively telling the data collector on your machine to submit all websites on this list as normal, but record all NON-whitelisted websites as generic browser time. This offers complete privacy for sites not on the list. RescueTime simply never receives any site-specific data for non-whitelisted sites.\n\nIgnore Activities\n\nRescueTime also allows you to ignore specific applications selectively. We strongly discourage this, as it can skew data dramatically. However, this feature can be used for virtual machine applications like VMWare (where you can ignore VMWare and choose to install RescueTime on the virtual machine).\n\nYou can ignore an activity from your Apps & Websites Report. We share details on how to ignore apps and websites here.\n\nYou can manage your ignored activities from your Data & Privacy page.\n\nLogging Schedule\n\nYou can specify which days and times of the week you want to monitor your activities. You can enable RescueTime to monitor your activities all day.\n\nIf you choose to define days and times, then toggle the 24 x 7 option off and click on the Manage Logging Schedule link.\n\nRescueTime will record events only during the days and times you selected. Outside of those hours, you'll notice that the RescueTime icon is grayed out.",

      "# [RescueTime Review to Create Timesheets in 2024 by Engineering Team on 2024-02-23](https://clickup.com/blog/rescuetime-review/)\nTime is the only resource you can’t make more of. Streamlining your to-do list can certainly help, but when you’re sending out a time management SOS, you need a tool like RescueTime to throw you a life preserver.\n\nTime-tracking software is a must-have for true productivity, and that’s where RescueTime comes in. It functions as a time tracker and timesheet tool with a dose of structure, insight, and helpful but pesky reminders to keep you on track. 🏃\n\nLike any productivity tool, RescueTime has its pros and cons. If you aren’t sure whether it’s worth your time (see what we did there?), check out this RescueTime app review. We’ll explain how RescueTime works, its pros, cons, and pricing. Plus, we’ll share a great alternative to RescueTime if you decide it’s not your thing. Let’s get to it!\n\nWhat Is RescueTime?\n\nRescueTime is a time-tracking tool designed to help you master time management. Sure, it tracks your time, but this all-in-one productivity tool does more than that. It provides comprehensive insights into how you spend your time.\n\nWhether you’re a freelancer who needs to create accurate timesheets or a team leader who needs to boost productivity levels, RescueTime offers the insights you need to set and meet goals. 🏅\n\nThe tool runs quietly in the background on your computer or mobile device, whether it’s Windows, Mac, iOS, or Android, gathering data on your activity. It then compiles this data into detailed reports and graphs showcasing your most productive times, distracting websites, and how you distributed work hours between tasks.\n\nRescueTime is different than other productivity and time-tracking tools because it gives you a productivity score (which it calls the productivity pulse). This score measures how efficiently you use your time. You can also set goals for your focus time and block distractions to stay in the zone.\n\nKey RescueTime Features\n\nThere’s a lot to love about RescueTime. Compared to competitors like Toggl and Clockify, it offers a more robust way to track your time and improve time management. Optimize your work hours and say bye-bye to distractions with RescueTime’s time-saving features.\n\n1. Focus Sessions\n\nRescueTime’s main feature is Focus Session, a Pomodoro-like work sesh where you set aside a block of time for focused work. The goal is to get into a mental flow state by mono-tasking, which is the key to real productivity. 🧠\n\nWe like that RescueTime doesn’t just throw you into a Focus Session. Their setup wizard takes you through a helpful prep session that includes a body check-in, reminding you to go to the bathroom or grab water. RescueTime also asks you to go through a quick mental reset, take a deep breath, and commit to your Focus Session before you click the “start” button.\n\nUsers say they like the prep checklist and the Focus Sessions themselves. You’re free to customize the session however you see fit. For example, RescueTime integrates with Spotify to personalize the experience without opening another app.\n\nAlso, every Focus Session tells you how many other workers are in Focus Sessions worldwide in real time. Body doubling, or feeling more motivated when someone works alongside you (in person or virtually), helps you get even more out of these Focus Sessions.\n\n2. RescueTime Assistant and AI (beta)\n\nAll RescueTime accounts come with an Assistant, which gives you a customized morning forecast of the day’s meetings and to-dos. Not only that, but the RescueTime Assistant also looks at your schedule and tells you the best time for focused work in between meetings and events. 🔎\n\nThis feature is still in beta, but RescueTime is also rolling out an AI-powered assistant. Currently available only for timesheets, the AI automatically divides time between projects and clients, improving the accuracy of your time-tracking. However, the AI needs a lot of data to do this for you, so set aside plenty of time to train the model.\n\n3. Distraction alerts and blocking\n\nHow often have you sat down intending to work, only to find yourself scrolling through Instagram? It happens to the best of us. 🙈\n\nSometimes, you need to take care of business, and in a world where distractions are just a tap away, you need to take more extreme measures.\n\nWhat sets RescueTime apart from other time-tracking apps is its ability to block distractions. Tell it which apps or websites are your Kryptonite, and it will block them during every Focus Session.\n\nIf you “forget” and try to access distracting websites anyway, you’ll get a pop-up from RescueTime displaying your timer, time management goals, and a healthy guilt trip to remind you to return to work. 👀\n\n4. RescueTime community sessions\n\nRescueTime is a wiz at implementing body doubling. For extra motivation, join one of its community Focus Sessions. These are Pomodoro-style one-hour or two-hour Focus Sessions happening live worldwide.\n\nIf you don’t want to join the all-hands-on-deck RescueTime sessions, you can always create a shared space with coworkers, colleagues, or strangers while you work. This tricks your brain into thinking other people are holding you accountable and working alongside you, which works wonders for productivity.\n\n5. Time metrics\n\nAwareness is a great time management technique. At the end of every Focus Session, RescueTime will send you detailed reports and graphs illustrating your productivity pulse.\n\nThese reports break down your activities into categories such as “very productive,” “productive,” and “distracting,” allowing you to see where your time is going at a glance. RescueTime will even rank your distractions so you can pinpoint the culprits more quickly. 📌\n\nRescueTime Pricing\n\nFree version\n\nMonthly: $12/month\n\nAnnually: $6.50/month, billed annually for $78\n\nPros of Using RescueTime\n\nChoosing RescueTime as your go-to time-tracking tool comes with plenty of benefits. While RescueTime might not be right for everyone, loyal fans love the app for several reasons.\n\nImproved self-awareness\n\nRescueTime’s metrics, notifications, and distraction reminders make you more aware of your daily routine. Its detailed reports clarify how you spend time, making it easier to identify bad habits and spot opportunities for improvement. It might sting a little to get a slap on the wrist for goofing off when you’re supposed to be working, but it’s all for the sake of boosting your productivity.\n\nFewer distractions\n\nOther time management tools might say, “Hey, you’re distracted!” However, RescueTime takes things a step further by literally blocking distractions. 🛑\n\nIt blocks distracting websites and apps during your designated focus time so you can preserve concentration. This feature is heaven-sent for anyone easily sidetracked by social media and other online distractions, ensuring you give your undivided attention to the most important tasks.\n\nAutomation\n\nRescueTime also has an automatic time-tracking feature that eliminates manual time entries, boosting the accuracy of your timesheets. That’s particularly helpful for freelancers who must provide precise time reports to clients or teams needing to track project management progress.\n\nGoal-setting\n\nRescueTime differs from other solutions because it allows you to set and achieve goals in record time. Set goals for your productive time and get alerts to stay on track. It’s fully customizable, too, so you’re free to make the platform your own.\n\nSmart integrations\n\nRescueTime eliminates the headaches of hopping back and forth between solutions, tools, and platforms. Integrate it with Slack, your calendar, or other project management software to streamline your workflow.\n\nCommon Pain Points RescueTime Users Face\n\nAs much as folks love RescueTime, it has a few setbacks. Users commonly mention these pain points.\n\nLots and lots of data\n\nRescueTime can initially seem overwhelming. It generates impressive data about your habits, but it takes time to make sense of the detailed reports. Like any platform, new users frequently complain about RescueTime’s learning curve. Take time to familiarize yourself with the dashboard and reports and learn how to interpret your metrics correctly. 📈\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\nRescueTime tracks everything you do across all of your tracked devices. Some users rightfully worry about privacy, especially regarding tracking features like screenshots or detailed logs of the websites they visit. RescueTime has robust privacy policies for data governance, but you need to give up some privacy to get the full benefit of the platform.\n\nLimited free features\n\nThe free version of RescueTime doesn’t have the advanced features you’ll get in RescueTime Premium. You won’t have as much freedom to customize goals, block distractions, or generate in-depth reports, which can be a drawback for anyone on a budget. 💸\n\nSyncing issues\n\nYou’ll probably see syncing issues using RescueTime across multiple devices, like your desktop and phone. There are occasional delays or inconsistencies between the desktop and mobile apps, which could give you an inaccurate picture of your productivity.\n\nRescueTime Reviews on Reddit\n\nWhat do the people of the internet really think about RescueTime? We took to Reddit to weigh the good, the bad, and the ugly of this productivity tool.\n\nSome users say RescueTime does a great job, but several had issues with the price of RescueTime Premium ($78 annually). They also mentioned they didn’t think the premium version was much better than the free version.\n\nOther users noticed RescueTime had some pretty big time-tracking discrepancies. “ActivityWatch tracked 17m; Rescuetime said I spent only 8 minutes, which is wrong by a margin. Also, note that they haven’t made significant changes to the Windows app since 2020/05/19. Like WHAT?” one user said.\n\nSome folks said the free version worked just fine, while others liked the premium features but not the premium price. Many users mentioned switching to RescueTime alternatives because of tracking discrepancies and out-of-date apps.\n\nRescueTime has much going for it, but it isn’t the be-all, end-all. This time log tool lacks many features, so you’ll likely still be flipping between different tools to do your work.\n\nEnter ClickUp, an alternative productivity and work management platform that offers time tracking, project management, and much more. 🎯\n\nSmart project time tracking\n\nHow much time do you spend on each project, task, or client? You’ll never know for sure without ClickUp project time tracking.\n\nThis project time-tracking features allow you to track time, create estimates, add notes, and more. Whether it’s the free Chrome extension, mobile app, or desktop site, you get an accurate view of your work in a single report. 📝\n\nSpeaking of reports, ClickUpTime Tracking cards are perfect for monitoring timesheets, estimates, billing, and more. Build a custom dashboard with Time Tracking cards of your choice to get a high-level view of your most important productivity metrics in one place.\n\nSolid time management\n\nTime tracking is one thing—time management is another beast entirely. That’s why ClickUp also includes tools for time management and goal-setting. Add time estimates to any task or split time between team members to manage expectations and keep your team on task.\n\nIf you’re a visual worker, ClickUp also has something for that. Toggle between Calendar view, Gantt view, Timeline view, or Workload view for a bird’s-eye look at what’s on your plate. 🤩\n\nTime-saving templates\n\nHey, do you know what RescueTime doesn’t have? Templates.\n\nGuess what ClickUp has? Templates by the pound!\n\nYou’re in the driver’s seat with ClickUp. Pull a template and customize it to meet your team’s time-tracking needs. For example, the ClickUp Services Timesheet Template allows team members to track work hours weekly. ⏳\n\nMoreover, the ClickUp Time Management Schedule Template is helpful for organizing your schedule and examining how you spend time.\n\nClickUp pricing\n\nFree Forever\n\nUnlimited: $7/month per user\n\nBusiness: $12/month per user\n\nEnterprise: Contact for pricing\n\nClickUp Brain: Available on all paid plans for $5/Workspace member/month\n\nSimplify Activity Tracking With ClickUp\n\nWe could all do with some extra time. But you can’t create more time, which is why maximizing your time at work is so important. The RescueTime app is a popular solution for time-strapped professionals, but it still requires hopping from platform to platform to do your actual work.\n\nClickUp is a true all-in-one solution for tracking both connected and offline time.

      "# [RescueTime: Dive into Efficiency [with RescueTime vs Everhour] by black-and-white films on 2024-06-02](https://everhour.com/blog/rescuetime-vs-everhour-examining-the-two/)\nMany organizations now apply the best time tracking practices to monitor employee activity and measure team performance to improve business operations. Thanks to time tracking tools, such as RescueTime, monitoring and improving productivity has never been easier. This article will shed light on RescueTime – its main features, pricing, pros & cons, tips and tricks, and compare two popular tools to determine which time tracker will be on top: RescueTime vs Everhour.\n\nWhat Is RescueTime?\n\nWe’ll begin by exploring RescueTime. The tool was created to tackle some of the problems present in the modern workplace, namely, stress, reduced productivity, and burnout. One of the best ways to improve your productivity is to understand how you spend your time, so you can make necessary adjustments. RescueTime tracks your activity on a computer or mobile device and then provides you with insights into how you spend your time.\n\nRescueTime Features\n\nRescue time provides users with a variety of useful features, which we’ll explore in more detail.\n\n🚜 Activity tracking\n\nOne of RescueTime’s best features is its activity-tracking feature. It lets users see exactly what their team members have been doing each day. The feature tracks the time a user spends on a particular website, app, or even a specific document, allowing management to review their team members’ working habits and make adjustments if necessary.\n\n🔖 Activity labeling\n\nOnce RescueTime has collected the necessary data about how you use your time, it will categorize it into how productive it is on a scale with five different productivity levels. Some websites may be deemed as distracting in some roles and productive in others. For example, scrolling through your company’s news website is part of your job if you’re a journalist. As a result, you can mark certain websites as productive rather than distracting.\n\n❗ Work goals and distraction blockers\n\nRescueTime enables you to set a personal daily work goal and allows you to block distractions when necessary during what the platform calls a ‘focus session’. The app tracks what you’re working on and will alert you when you’re beginning to lose focus or trying to work on too many tasks at one time.\n\n📊 Dashboard\n\nThis data is then presented on a dashboard. It gives you a productivity pulse and measures your productivity compared to the previous day. Additionally, the dashboard presents your activities by color: blue being productive, grey as neither productive nor distracted, and red as distracted. Finally, a table of each hour that you’ve worked that day will be populated with the color corresponding to the activity you did during that time.\n\nOnce you’ve used the app for a while, it will give you more detailed insights into how you use your time. For example, if you use the app for a couple of months, you may find that you’re particularly productive on certain days.\n\n📃 Reporting\n\nThe data recorded in the dashboard can be converted into a report, which you can download and share with whoever you like by emailing them a copy within the platform. With a premium subscription, users can view a wealth of information in reports. This includes:\n\n– Detailed activity reporting\n\n– Trends within your activity to show how you work overtime\n\n– A breakdown of your activities by an input source\n\n– The ability to view your data based on customized time filters\n\n– Exporting your data to CSV and filtering data based on specific keywords\n\n🔏 Privacy\n\nRescueTime allows you to disable the platform for certain apps and websites, giving you control over what information is recorded. You can pause the RescueTime app at any time. The app allows you to pause all RescueTime activity for 15 minutes, an hour, or until tomorrow to give you privacy.\n\nPlus, you can schedule the app to only record your activity at certain times of day, outside of these times, the app will not track your activity. That’s not all—you can also restrict which websites RescueTime logs by creating a white list of websites you would like RescueTime to track.\n\n🔁 Integrations\n\nYou can allow other apps to use your RescueTime data. The app can be integrated with several platforms, including but not limited to\n\nThese integrations enable you to get the most out of the platform. You can also export reports to a CSV file, but only if you have a premium subscription.\n\n🔧 Support and platforms\n\nRescueTime offers various support options if you encounter problems. The first port of call is the RescueTime knowledge base, where you’ll find informative articles about the platform, troubleshooting information, and FAQs. Suppose these pages do not help you fix a problem. In that case, you can contact the RescueTime team on the company website using the contact form, leave a phone message or email the team at contact@rescuetime.com.\n\nRescueTime is a web-based platform, but it also has a mobile app that lets you track mobile phone usage. The RescueTime app is available on Android and IOS.\n\n💲 Pricing\n\nRescueTime offers a free version of the app with limited features. The RescueTime premium plan, which includes all the outlined features, costs $6.50 a month per user when billed yearly.\n\n❓ Alternatives\n\nRescueTime is a great app if your main goal is to track your productivity. However, it does not offer the same billing and invoicing features as other time tracking and productivity apps on the market. If you’re looking for an alternative app to increase your productivity, consider Todoist.\n\nThe app is used by millions of people to plan and collaborate on projects of all sizes. You can write to-do lists, create labels, set priority levels to highlight your most pressing tasks, set reminders, highlight favorites, and delegate tasks to team members. Additionally, you can see tangible progress through productivity visualizations, which, by week and month, help you stay on track to achieve set goals.\n\n✅❌ Pros and cons of RescueTime\n\nWhy users might be looking for a RescueTime alternative?\n\nWhile RescueTime is fully functional and can take care of most of your needs, it’s worth taking a look at some of the drawbacks users might encounter when using it.\n\n1️⃣ Occasionally, it can be challenging to allocate a recorded activity to a specific project, particularly when managing multiple concurrent projects that require the same tools.\n\nEverhour simplifies the process of allocating recorded activities to specific projects, even when managing numerous concurrent projects with similar tool requirements. Its intuitive interface and project-centric organization make it easy to accurately track time and assign activities, ensuring precise project management and streamlined workflow.\n\n2️⃣ Learning how to navigate the platform may require a bit of a learning curve initially, but once mastered, its robust features enhance productivity significantly. Compared to other options, the pricing might seem a bit higher, but the value it brings in terms of features and efficiency outweighs the cost. Also, managing time-tracking offline could present some challenges.\n\nEverhour offers comprehensive tutorials, onboarding assistance, and a user-friendly interface to ease the learning curve for new users. Additionally, its efficient time-tracking features ultimately save time and enhance productivity, offsetting any initial learning investments.\n\nWhile Everhour’s pricing may appear slightly higher, its value lies in its extensive features, customizable options, and reliable customer support, making it a worthwhile investment for businesses seeking top-tier time-tracking solutions.\n\nWith Everhour’s mobile app and offline time tracking capabilities, users can seamlessly track their time from anywhere, ensuring accurate records even when internet connectivity is limited.

With its sleek design and user-friendly layout, Everhour can address concerns about outdated interfaces, offering a more enjoyable and efficient time-tracking solution.\n\n4️⃣ Users may find that the API capabilities of RescueTime are very limited, and updates to the platform may sometimes result in a less satisfactory experience rather than improvements.\n\nEverhour offers a robust and flexible API that allows for seamless integration with other tools and platforms. Additionally, Everhour continuously enhances its features based on user feedback, ensuring that updates improve the user experience rather than detract from it.\n\nAs you can see, Everhour is an intuitive attendance tracker that enables users to track time, estimate tasks, set budgets for projects, and build detailed reports to distribute internally or send to clients. Additionally, Everhour provides dozens of integrations, allowing users to use all of the above features in their chosen project management tool, such as Basecamp or Asana. It’s a great alternative to RescueTime as we can explore more in further sections.\n\nEverhour Features\n\nEverhour provides users with a variety of helpful features, which we’ll explore in more detail.\n\n🕜 Time tracking\n\nFirst, Everhour offers easy-to-use employee time tracking tools. Use a native timer or enter the time you worked on a task manually. Plus, you can set time estimates so you can see how much time you’ve got left to spend on a chosen task. You can also set reminders, so you receive notifications about long-running timers.\n\nIf that wasn’t enough, with Everhour, managers can review and approve timesheets (via a timesheet app) for their team members, allowing them to easily keep track of the hours their team is working.\n\n📚 Task management\n\nTask management has never been easier because of Everhour. The platform enables you to quickly create new tasks, determine work priorities, set deadlines, and assign tasks to specific team members. Additionally, you can use sections and tags to organize and add context to your tasks, meaning there’s less room for confusion.\n\nAnother key task management feature of Everhour is choosing between board and list views for your project task—Everhour gives you the option to choose the view that makes the most sense to you. With all your tasks laid out in front of you, it’s easy to know what you should be working on.\n\n🧮 Billing and invoicing\n\nOne of Everhour’s key strengths is its billing and invoicing capabilities. You can create new invoices based on tracked time and relevant expenses, use dynamic variables that will be replaced with real data in invoice line items, translate invoice labels, apply online invoice generator, and connect with accounting platforms such as QuickBooks, FreshBooks, or Xero to sync your clients, and copy invoices.\n\nAdditionally, Everhour enables you to track work-related expenses attach receipts to expenses, and use unit pricing per expense category.\n\n📃 Reporting\n\nEverhour provides in-depth reporting, allowing you to access analytics to increase productivity and show your clients exactly what they are paying for. You can create custom reports using filters to arrange columns and add certain conditions to create the reports you require. Plus, you can gain a deeper understanding of tasks using metadata such as tags, task types, or specific milestones.\n\nOnce you’ve created a report, you can share it with your team members or download it to send to a client. To save time, you can schedule reports to send to a list of email addresses on a specified day, on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.\n\n🌟 Project management\n\nOne thing that makes Everhour different from other time tracking software is the project management capabilities the platform offers. Everhour offers users real integration by injecting time management controls into your chosen project management platform, be it Trello, Jira, or ClickUp (or Monday project management), and enjoy their PM features with time tracking controls, so you and your team members don’t need to duplicate information on two different platforms.\n\n🔁 Integrations\n\nEverhour integrates seamlessly into dozens of different applications, allowing you to say goodbye to tab switching once and for all! You can integrate Everhour with a wide selection of platforms, including but not limited to Asana, Basecamp, ClickUp, Jira, Trello, Monday, GitHub, and QuickBooks.\n\nIntegrating Everhour with your chosen project management or accounting platforms allows you and your team members to stay on the same page.\n\n🔧 Support and platforms\n\nEverhour offers support to users in various ways. The first port of call can be found on the Everhour Help Docs page, where you’ll find helpful user guides which run you through the platform’s many features. If you face problems that cannot be fixed with the help of the user guides, you can contact Everhour using the contact form on the company’s website.\n\nRegarding platforms, Everhour is a cloud-based solution. As a result, all you need to do is download Everhour’s browser extension, which is available on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge browsers. In addition, Evethour is currently beta testing an app, which is available to download via the Apple Store.\n\n💲 Pricing\n\nEverhour offers simple pricing with no extra fees. There is a Free plan with basic time tracking and reporting features. A monthly subscription to Everhour costs $5 and $8.50 per month per user if billed annually. A Team plan subscription includes all features, including unlimited users, projects, integrations, and fast and responsive support should you encounter any problems.\n\n❓ Alternatives\n\nEverhour is an intuitive time tracking software with many excellent features. However, it may not be the best fit for all users, and it isn’t the only tool available. A great alternative to Everhour is Time Doctor. Time Doctor is a great alternative to Everhour because it offers user-friendly time tracking, distraction management, reporting, payroll, and integration features, all in one easy-to-use app.\n\n✅❌ Pros and cons of Everhour\n\nRescueTime vs. Everhour: Pros and Cons\n\nRescueTime\n\n✅ Pros:\n\n– Runs in the background as you work, allowing you to seamlessly track productivity\n\n– Fast and responsive support is available, should you run into issues\n\n– Daily and weekly performance monitoring displayed in an easy-to-understand dashboard\n\n❌ Cons:\n\n– The user interface is not as intuitive as other platforms on the market\n\n– Fewer integration options than other similar tools\n\n– Limited project management capabilities compared to other time tracking platforms on the market\n\n– Limited customization\n\n– No team attendance reports are available\n\nEverhour\n\n✅ Pros:\n\n– Great for teams working either remotely or in the office, making collaboration easier\n\n– Lots of project management and accounting integrations to use\n\n– Great reporting tools that allow you to improve business operations\n\n– Simple interface\n\n– Affordable pricing for teams\n\n❌ Cons:\n\n– No offline usability option\n\n– No Android app available at present\n\nThe Verdict: RescueTime vs Everhour\n\nWhile RescueTime focuses on its key feature, activity-tracking, to increase productivity, Everhour gives users greater variety in terms of available features.

      "# [Show HN: Rem: Remember Everything (open source)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38787892)\nThis does look cool. It reminds me of a recent discovery I made. The other day, while trying to recover some disk space, I found a giant file on my hard disk. It turned out to be a nine-hour screen recording from almost a year ago. I had no idea it existed, so I must’ve accidentally left the screen recording on. Scrubbing through it sped up, watching the whole thing in a couple minutes, was fascinating; it was like a window into my thought process at that time. You could see how I was researching something online. It was almost like a play-by-play, akin to re-watching a sports performance – very instructive and surprisingly useful.\n\nAlso, the the sense of being back in that time seeing details that I otherwise probably would’ve forgotten was transformative.\n\nIn a similar vein to what you’ve done, but focusing specifically on web browsing, I’ve created a tool called ‘DownloadNet.’ It archives for offline use and fully indexes every page you visit. Additionally, it can be configured to archive only the pages you bookmark, offering another mode of operation. It’s an open-source tool, so feel free to check it out: https://github.com/dosyago/DownloadNet\n\nthanks for checking it out, sure: some of the ways people are using it follow below.\n\n- reverse-proxy to protect proprietary code on your website from being inspected\n\n- content accelerator (similar to mightyapp's original idea) where it's faster to render pages on a cloud vps with thick bandwidth than it is on a local device (in some cases at least!), and depending on the usage profile, it's even cheaper to serve that bandwidth, especially if you use additional video codecs.\n\n- a framework to deliver web data collection and automation, agent authoring and intervention tooling on any device with no download\n\n- cors-proxy to include and access content across domains for building design and test tools saas\n\n- co-browsing for customer training and demonstration\n\nand then there's the many cybersecurity and privacy ways including:\n\n- standard remote browser isolation to isolate your device from zero day threats (an extra couple layers, requiring an even longer exploit chain, of protection, at least)\n\n- to aid compliance and privacy by preventing insider data exfiltration in both directions when dealing with sensitive data (by blocking file transfer, copy paste, etc)\n\nadmittedly it's diverse, and hard make generalizations about customers.\n\none way i think is cool that i haven't seen yet (but want to get around to doing myself!) is a way to deliver \"browser extensions\" without needing either: 1) a compatible browser on your device, 2) the extension to come from a store, 3) any local download. In some sense it's safer as the extension does not run locally, but in other ways it's more dangerous as there's no central store. But it's very cool to explore, and what we really need for that is a great \"developer API\" that can expose a \"browser extensions\"-like layer.\n\nOne cool thing is that ad-blocking extensions built on BrowserBox will not be limited by the current restrictions that extensions developers face on existing platforms. The aim is to provide a powerful instrumentation api as simply as possible.\n\nthank you for your question :)\n\nbtw - 42matters looks great! love your site design, really fantastic look. analytics is surely lucrative, i knew a similarly focused company also bearing the name 42 i'm sure. somewhere before anyway (but surely it had a different origin!). is 42 indicative of something special in analytics?\n\nLong time ago, I did sth similar, i.e. made a screenshot every few seconds, with the purpose to automatically extract information from it, e.g. how long I was using some app.\n\nI wrote a PNG DB to split PNG images into many blocks and have each block stored in a DB. If there are several equal blocks, it is only stored once. Via a hash table, the lookup for such blocks is made fast. With this PNG DB, I have a compression rate of about 400-500%. https://github.com/albertz/png-db\n\nSome of the scripts I used to analyze the screenshots are here, but in the end, it was not really so successful and reliable: https://github.com/albertz/screenshooting\n\nIn the end, that lead to another project, where I just was storing that information more directly, i.e. what application was in the foreground, what file was open. https://github.com/albertz/timecapture\n\n> like if I see C# or Python it makes sense to me at least in some way\n\nCould it be that you're just more used to looking at C#/Python than other things, then other things are more foreign and therefor look messy?\n\nAs another anecdote, I cannot stand browsing/looking through C# code as it tends to be filled with various classes just to basically write very basic programs. The amount of over-engineering I've seen in C# surpasses everything else I've looked at. Not to mention how people seem to arbitrary chose between private/public with no real consensus on when to use what, everything seems to be encapsulated in the wrong way. And don't get me started on the infrastructure around it, csproj vs sln and dealing with dependencies/assemblies.\n\nBut then I mostly write Clojure code day-to-day, and I realize that my troubles for dealing with C# is mostly because of what I'm used to, not because the language itself is inherently shit. I only have myself to blame for this. I'm sure people who write C# day-to-day have the same feelings about Clojure as I have about C#.\n\nCopying text from the saved footage is wild!\n\nI had a poor man's version of this with TimeSnapper Classic, a free Windows utility that takes a screenshot every n seconds then lets you view a timelapse at the end of the day to show how you spent your time.\n\nAfter a few weeks my disk was starting to fill up with screenshots. I browsed the folders and noticed that most of the screenshots looked almost identical. \"I should come up with some kind of image codec optimized for image sequences, that diffs against the previous image to save space.\" Then realized I had basically reinvented GIF / video codec haha. So I wrote a script to shove the timestamp (filename) into the image itself (with ImageMagick), and convert them to video with ffmpeg. 99.9% size reduction!\n\nThis looks a lot more useful though.\n\nAbout Remember Everything\n\nI use singleFile ( browser extension) - saves a copy of every webpage I view on Chrome and FireFox. I use a program AutomaticScreenshotter to record my screen activity to capture other non browser activity. Enables me to work what I was doing on my PC at any past date. All files are saved in a Year/month/day dir structure. Finding stuff - use windows search at present.\n\nI also use ditto to save all copy and pastes in a mysqldb.\n\nI've been doing this since before 2010 ( the dir structure) THe extensions and screengrabs , only started that about 3-4 years ago.\n\nI've often wonder if forensic PC investigation tools would /could also be used ( my with some mods to help produce a PC timeline of my activity.\n\nCongrats on getting this off the ground, and thank you for putting it out there for us to learn from!\n\nI've been curious how Rewind worked under the hood because I've been playing with an idea in my head: an AI assistant that helps you protect your attention.\n\nYou would describe the kind of content that you consider a distraction, and any other constraints you have (e.g. \"Don't let me watch cat videos unless I'm on a break\".\n\nAnd whenever it sees you watching anything that fits your prompt, it'll pop up on the screen and start a conversation with you to try and understand whether you actually need to consume the content you're looking at.\n\nAn AI that intervenes when you're going off track (based purely on how YOU define going off track). Current website blocking approaches aren't useful because they're all-or-nothing. I don't ever want to block entire sites because often there's useful content there relevant for my work. I want to block content on a much more granular level.\n\nAnd I'd love for an \"attention audit\" at the end of each day. Attention is our most valuable asset, and I believe protecting it is a worthwhile endeavor... I'd just like some help doing so :).\n\nGenuinely so pleased with this! I'm a big fan of Rewind as a concept because, in general, I write down everything I do every day (helps with my poor memory, adhd, and in general), and a tool that can record my online-actions and facilitate search too is a game-changer for me (specially when it doesn't come with the hefty price tag).\n\nCouple things -- 1) Do you ever plan on introducing shortcuts to toggle rem as opposed to using the menu-bar option?\n\n2) What's storage like? Will rem's size keep getting larger and larger until I purge all? Or will I eventually get to select how long I want to 'remember' something (without manually having to 'start' and 'stop')?\n\n3) One bug I've caught a few times is - once I toggle timeline and just slide back to view previous 'memories', >50% of the time my device won't let me exit out of the 'timeline' and I'll have to exit out of rem (cmd+opt+esc) and re-open it.\n\nBut all in all, very happy with this!\n\nVery cool demo OP. Not sure why it's only for Apple Silicone, is it because of it's superior ML support compared to windows? Side oservarion, Olama is not available for Windows. Sadly I won't be able to test this out since I don't own a Apple Silicon notebook, I only have a Apple Intel and beefy Windows.\n\nI don't know if I am a basic programmer or lack the idea on how do folks go build something like this from scratch with no Swift programming language. If I was OP, I would first do bunch of Swift tutorials.\n\nThis will be wishful thinking but it is a legitimate side project to make a clone of this to work on Linx oe WIndows on programming language I am most comfortable in, Java and C#. I have zero background in building anything in ML and not at all familiar with Direct X api or Linux Desktop API or Direct X.\n\nThe point I am trying to make is there is crap ton of API and tools to be familiar with before even taking the step to code.\n\nHow did OP crack this with no exp in Swift to build this? Is it simplar to build project on Apple Silicon and I should get one?\n\nMind you, I have 4 YOE and code in Java and C# doing vanilla web API and bit of WinFoem/DevExpress work.\n\nI have been in software for a while now. I just love learning and doing cool stuff.\n\nAs for being able to hack in Swift specifically... I'm comfortable in 5-6 languages, and play with many more. The language itself feels like a mix of C# and Kotlin to me. But I had no familiarity with Mac OS APIs or SwiftUI / MVVM etc. but there's lots of docs, despite them having effectively no examples.\n\nThe repo has a lot of room to grow in terms of quality, which is perfectly ok in my book.\n\nRe: Apple Silicon - I should have just said \"I built it on my laptop which is an M1 Air and it's managing to keep up with the screenshot -> OCR -> ffmpeg rendering pipeline and not completely drain the battery and have a strong suspicion it will require a lot more work to get it to perform the same on Intel computers\"\n\nAs for clone it and build it in Linux / Windows - do it. And there are other comments here suggesting others want to do the same.\n\nI personally want this thing, if I can impact speed of it happening positively, awesome.\n\nI want to record everything and have this nice big dataset which is what I've experienced (on my laptop) the last X amount of time, and be able to do stuff with it - whether it's chat with a local llm or have a really good way to search back in time. I _constantly_ need things from the past.\n\nSurprisingly this is something that I have been thinking on for the whole 2023.\n\nI myself am really bad at documenting findings while doing research or bugfixing so I started at recording all my daily activities for both replaying research sessions and also for my future me in case something is not clear in the docs.\n\nThen I knew rewind and I was happy to know that I am not alone. This REM is the confirmation that this definitely has great use cases :)\n\nI’d rather prefer the recording phase to be as lightweight as possible so I am recording the full mp4 video and plan to re-encode at a lower rate at night. But there is a compromise between recording quality and file size, I do not want end up with several Petabytes of videos.\n\nWhat codec do you recommend for this use case? Lossy video codecs usually are very efficient for real images (just like the comparison between jpg/png) and I am sure a video format that is PNG based should be more efficient in space while preserving text quality.\n\nI am very interested in read your thoughts about this.",

      "# [6 best time tracking apps in 2024 by Nicole Replogle on 2018-09-17](https://zapier.com/blog/best-time-tracking-apps/)\nIf you spent an hour working on a client project, but no timer was around to track it, did you even do any work? (That's how that saying goes, right?)\n\nAs a freelancer, I'm responsible for every aspect of my business, from client work to marketing to record-keeping and admin. I keep detailed records of how long every business task and client project takes me, which helps me price my services accurately and avoid overbooking my schedule. But whether you're a solopreneur like me or a 9-5 office worker, knowing how you spend your time gives you crucial insight into—and control over—where you spend your energy.\n\nTime tracking apps make it easier to record billable hours, streamline your business processes, and improve your personal productivity. The best time trackers have built-in timers but also let you edit or add time manually. Some of these apps even incorporate AI for a hands-off tracking process, so you can focus on deep work and leave the analytics for later.\n\nAfter several weeks of in-depth testing, I've rounded up the best time tracking apps for individuals and teams so you can choose the app and features that match your work style best.\n\nThe best time tracking apps\n\nToggl Track for a free time tracking app\n\nHourStack for integrating with your team's project management software\n\nTimely for automated time tracking for large teams\n\nMemtime for simplified automated time tracking\n\nTrackingTime for visualizing time differently\n\nRescueTime for reducing distractions\n\nWhat makes the best time tracking software?\n\nWhen you know how you spend your time, you can analyze your work trends and make smarter business decisions. Whether you're working solo or in a small team, time tracking software can give you a complete overview of your daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly work.\n\nWhat do you do with this information? Perhaps most importantly, project time tracking can help you get paid, allowing you to feel confident about your invoices rather than trying to estimate how much time you worked after the fact. If you're part of a team, time tracking can help you answer the question, \"What have you been working on this month?\"\n\nWhen evaluating the best time tracking apps, I considered the following criteria:\n\nReal-time tracking. Nearly all time tracking apps let you track in real time, meaning they give you a running clock that you launch when you start a task, and that you can pause or stop when you finish.\n\nThe ability to edit time tracked or manually add time blocks. The best apps let you correct time tracked after the fact, such as if you accidentally leave a timer running while you take off for lunch. You should be able to edit the time log to subtract however many minutes you weren't working. You also want an app that lets you enter a block of time post hoc in case you forget to launch a timer at all. For example, if your phone rings and you jump into a 20-minute consulting call, you might not start a timer, but you do want to log and bill for those hours worked.\n\nReporting features. The most powerful time tracking apps offer dashboards and reports that let you break out daily, weekly, or monthly time spent per project, per person, or per client.\n\nThe ability to create an invoice or export data. Once you aggregate all your time spent on your work, you have to be able to take action on it. All these apps let you either automatically create invoices from the time tracking data stored in the app or export that information into PDFs, CSVs, or Google Sheets to share with the right people.\n\nMultiple points of access. The best time tracking tools make starting a timer easy and convenient. They have the versatility to let you start a timer from wherever is most convenient to you, whether that's your browser, a desktop app, or your mobile device.\n\nBonus: AI features. Artificial intelligence is automating and simplifying workflows across tools of all industries, and time tracking apps are no exception. I gave special consideration to time trackers that use AI to auto-track your time or use machine learning to automatically assign time blocks to related tasks and projects.\n\nWhat's not included in this roundup\n\nHere, I focused specifically on finding a time tracker for freelancers, individuals, and small teams. I didn't consider employee monitoring software, which often includes some type of time tracking. I did include two automated tracking tools that monitor users' activities—but the data is for each user's eyes only. With these tools, you choose how much (if any) data to share with your supervisors. If you're looking for more team-focused apps, take a look at Zapier's picks for the best free timesheet software.\n\nAdditionally, I haven't included project management, invoicing, or accounting apps that come with an add-on or built-in time tracker. While time-tracking clocks can be very helpful inside these tools, I assume if that's what you need, you're likely shopping for a more robust solution.\n\nThe best time tracking apps at a glance\n\nBest free time tracking app\n\nToggl Track (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, Web, and browser extensions)\n\nIf you need a time tracker tool but can't pay for one, you should use Toggl Track. In fact, until I found my new favorite timer while researching for this article, Toggl has been a daily part of my freelance workflow. The time tracking tool has a generous free tier of service that gives you access to all its apps (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, Web, and browser extensions) and includes all the core functionality you'd expect in a time tracking app.\n\nToggl Track works so effortlessly primarily because it doesn't ask much of you when you start timing a task. With many time tracking apps, you have to have a client, project, and task entered into your account before the app will let you track time. If you don't, you have to set your task aside for the time being and enter them. With Toggl Track, you can track your time right away, view your tracked time entries in a grid or calendar format, and worry about the details later.\n\nAdditionally, when you use Toggl Track through the Chrome or Firefox browser extension, a Toggl timer button shows up in just about every web app you could imagine, from Google Docs (and other Google apps) to Help Scout. Because you always see the Toggl Track button while you're working, you have a continual reminder to track your time. I also like keeping the desktop app open on my computer, so even if I start a timer from my browser window, the running clock will appear on my Mac's menubar. The easy accessibility from wherever I am makes Toggl's timer one of the most flexible and easiest-to-use tools I've tested—and it's why I've used it regularly for over three years now.\n\nToggl Track also has some of the most detailed options I've seen in a time tracking app. For example, in the Toggl Track Chrome extension, you can automatically start and stop tracking time based on whether the browser is open or not. It also has excellent idle detection, which helps you maintain high accuracy across your records. When the app detects your computer has been idle but a timer is still running, it offers ways to correct the recorded block of time. That way, if you're interrupted while working and get sucked into a 20-minute conversation, Toggl Track can knock out those 20 minutes from your record. Toggl Track even has a Pomodoro Technique setting, so that you can work for a set amount of time on a project that requires your focus and then take a short break, all with simple stopwatch-like reminders.\n\nToggl has also recently upgraded its dashboards and reporting features for even more in-depth data analysis. You can create customized dashboards to see weekly stats or team summaries, and then generate reports filtered by team, tag, or client.\n\nFor even more flexibility, use Toggl Track's Zapier integrations to connect Toggl Track with your favorite apps, so you can start new time entries in Toggl Track when calendar events start, add new entries to a spreadsheet, and more. Learn more about how to automate Toggl Track, or get started with one of these pre-made workflows.\n\nWho Toggl Track isn't right for: While the free plan is simple and easy to use for basic time tracking and reporting, you'll need to upgrade to Premium if you want granular insights into your work, saved reports, or billable hours. For your money, another app on this list would probably work better for you. And there's no free task management or planning feature, so if you're looking for a way to schedule and track your team's workload, you'll need to look elsewhere.\n\nToggl Track pricing: Free for up to 5 users; $9/user/month when billed annually for the Starter plan, which includes time rounding, billable rates, saved reports, and more.\n\nBest time tracking app for integrating with your team's project management tool\n\nHourStack (Web, Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge)\n\nIf you're looking for a project time tracker that integrates smoothly with your favorite project management tool to help your team both plan and track your time, HourStack is worth exploring.\n\nHourStack is a sleek and easy-to-use combination calendar and time tracker that continues to impress me. The app has native integrations with popular project management tools like Asana, Google Tasks, Trello, Todoist, and even Google Calendar. When you connect to one of these apps, you can view your tasks from a sidebar from within HourStack—and drag and drop them directly into your HourStack calendar to schedule your team's workload.\n\nAnd the best part? The integration works both ways, so you can mark tasks completed from HourStack, and they'll update in your project manager. As a productivity tool nerd, I was impressed and excited by this feature.\n\nThe power of HourStack is in its simplicity. There's no danger of being overloaded or distracted with complicated settings or interfaces. The Calendar page shows you your planned tasks and lets you schedule and record work time. The Reports page, which is filterable by clients, projects, and labels, displays your scheduled vs. logged hours, along with how many tasks you've completed. And with the browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge, you can quickly add or start tracking project time without needing to input a task or project first.\n\nIf you need to connect HourStack to a tool that isn't supported natively, you can make your own HourStack integrations using Zapier. Connect HourStack to thousands of apps, so you can coordinate your time tracking however it's most useful. Here are a couple of examples.\n\nWho HourStack isn't right for: Those who want a desktop and/or mobile app. HourStack works in your browser and through browser extensions, and while it's very responsive for mobile, some users might feel constrained by the limited points of access.\n\nHourStack pricing: $12/month for one user; $15/user/month for teams.\n\nBest automated time tracker app for teams\n\nTimely (Web, macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, Chrome, Firefox)\n\nThe best time tracking apps make it as painless as possible to capture an accurate record of how you're spending your time. What's more painless and accurate than an automated time tracker?\n\nTimely is a time tracking app from Memory AS that makes \"Memories\" of every software and website you use during the day. Then, whenever it's convenient, you can drag and drop these Memories into their assigned tasks or projects to create a Timesheet.\n\nIf you're a part of an organization, a tool like this might seem a little scary—but Timely isn't an employee surveillance app. All the data it collects is private to you, and only you decide how much to share on your Timesheet. And if you don't want the app to track your activities at any point, you can easily toggle off the app from your menu bar.\n\nThe great thing about Timely is how easy it is to start using it. After downloading the desktop app, you'll be prompted to connect to your calendar and/or conferencing tools so that Timely can incorporate your meetings into your work schedule. You can also easily add projects, tasks, and clients and set up your hourly rate for people and projects.\n\nThen, just let the app work in the background. There's no need to remember to start and stop a timer—just spend a few minutes at the end of the day dragging and dropping activities into their respective projects on your time sheet, and you'll have an accurate and detailed accounting of how you spent your time.\n\nIt even records when you're in a Chrome tab group—which I love, since I use tab groups to organize different projects I'm working on at the same time. This thoughtful Timely feature makes it easy to assign tracked web activity to projects. And the new AI assistant also learns patterns in your time tracking and, after the first day or so, starts making suggestions for categorizing activities as projects.\n\nTimely offers very detailed and customized reports. Easily view unbilled hours and reports for the whole workspace or just a specific project. You can also create report templates for customized views, filtered by clients, projects, people, tags, or teams. Then, when it's time to invoice, Timely connects to QuickBooks to create invoices and push them to QuickBooks Online when they're ready to send.\n\nAnd if you like planning ahead, Timely also offers a task planner feature for an additional $5 per month. You can plan out tasks by the assignee or the project. Then, every day, drag and drop your activities into their respective tasks on your Timesheet to compare planned vs. tracked time for each task.\n\nWhat makes Timely such a great choice for teams is its emphasis on team scheduling and project management. You can click on the People tab to see a dashboard overview of planned vs. logged time, a breakdown by user, and an activities report for the team. Timely makes it easy to see who's at capacity and who's over-scheduled—and you can even filter for missing or overtime hours.\n\nTo get the most out of the app, you can integrate Timely with Zapier. Connect Timely to the rest of your tech stack to streamline processes like creating new clients or projects in Timely.\n\nWho Timely isn't right for: Users who don't want an AI tool to track their every move on their computer. Also, if you do a lot of work off-screen, Timely may not be the right fit for you; it's focused primarily on tracking and categorizing computer-based work.\n\nTimely pricing: $9/user/month for the Starter plan (up to 20 projects and 5 users). The Premium plan is $16/user/month for unlimited projects and 50 users.\n\nBest time tracking app for simplified auto-tracking\n\nMemtime (macOS, Windows, Linux)\n\nMemtime (formerly timeBro) is a relatively new automated time tracking tool that has quickly become my new favorite. I may give up my years-long Toggl reliance after spending a few weeks letting Memtime run in the background of my work.\n\nMuch like Timely, Memtime is a desktop app that keeps track of your computer activity, so you can categorize it later. No more remembering to start or stop a timer; just visit the app at the end of your workday to review and categorize what you've done.\n\nWhat I love so much about Memtime is its simplicity. The other auto-tracking tools I tested (including Timely) have so much emphasis on team project management and timesheet creation that it's easy to become overwhelmed. If, like me, you're not collaborating on projects with others or planning to submit detailed timesheets to your supervisor, tools like Timely might be overkill. Memtime's interface is much more minimalist, with a running log of your activity, a space where you can create entries with a click, and an overview of your day's work. There's also a page for project management—where you can add clients and projects manually or import them from your other apps—and a reporting page with your productivity stats. You can also sync Memtime with your calendar to view events alongside captured activities.\n\nTo create new time entries in the Timeline view, it's easy to click on the timeline and drag your cursor to adjust the entry's duration. The display is broken down into five-minute intervals (or you can choose a one-minute breakdown if you prefer to be more granular and don't mind scrolling). Alternatively, you can use List view, which lets you drag and drop activities to log new entries.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that Memtime only works in a desktop app; no mobile app or web access. And since Memtime uses five-minute intervals by default in the Timeline view, I found the total logged work time to be less precise than Timely. But since I'm just tracking for my personal use, the simplicity of Memtime is worth the sacrifice.\n\nIf you're looking to dip your toe into automated time tracking but don't want to be overwhelmed with team or project management features, I absolutely recommend trying Memtime.\n\nWho Memtime isn't right for: Users who don't want an AI app tracking their computer activities. Also, the tool is a little too minimalist for teams—and if you're looking for multiple integrations or a mobile app, look elsewhere.\n\nMemtime pricing: $12/user/month (with a 24-month subscription) for the Basic plan, which comes with fully automated time tracking and calendar sync. The Connect plan starts at $18/user/month for project management software integration.\n\nBest time tracking app for visualizing time differently\n\nTrackingTime (Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Web, Chrome, Firefox)\n\nTrackingTime is a collaborative time tracking tool that looks different from many other time tracking apps. It represents time in blocks or windows, just as if that working time were an event on your calendar. It's not the only app that lays out your time in this fashion, but it does offer the most opportunities for customization. For example, you can choose between a day, week, month, or team view.\n\nThe daily view has the most helpful layout I've seen, showing the full month's calendar on the left (with each day displaying an icon to show the amount of time tracked) and the day you select on the right, color-coded and organized by blocks of tracked time.\n\nTrackingTime also puts more emphasis on planning your time before you start working compared to other apps. For example, you can schedule blocks of time on your calendar for tasks you intend to work on later in the week or for recurring events, like meetings.\n\nThe Projects tab is the closest to a traditional project management tool that I've seen, with a sleek and user-friendly interface. It looks similar to an Asana list, where you can view tasks broken down by project, client, priority, or date. Clicking on a task expands a side panel where you can view tracked time, add attachments or subtasks, and set custom fields. If you're looking for a time tracker that doubles as a relatively robust task manager, TrackingTime is worth checking out.\n\nIf you'd rather keep your task manager separate, TrackingTime's Chrome extension integrates with several productivity tools, allowing you to start a timer directly from apps like Airtable, Asana, and Notion. Or you can connect TrackingTime to Zapier to help it talk to all the other apps you use. Here are a couple examples to get you started.\n\nWho TrackingTime isn't right for: Users who don't care about time blocking or scheduling specific tasks in advance.\n\nTrackingTime pricing: Free for up to 3 users; $5.75/user/month for the Pro plan for unlimited collaboration, advanced reporting, and team management features.\n\nBest time tracking app for reducing distractions\n\nRescueTime (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, Chrome, Firefox, Brave)\n\nRescueTime is an automatic time tracking app that prioritizes mindfulness, deep work, and reducing distractions throughout your workday.\n\nTo start using RescueTime's (far superior, in my opinion) \"Focus\" version, you'll first install a small monitoring app on your computer. This software works in the background to observe your computer usage and powers the RescueTime Assistant, \"a digital wellness coach.\"\n\nThe Assistant is accessible on your desktop's menubar, taskbar, or system tray, and helps you manage your daily work progress, goals, and reports. For example, it may alert you when you're distracted and multitasking more than normal.\n\nRescueTime's most interesting set of features are designed to help you focus and take on deep work—high-value, mentally-demanding projects. RescueTime refers to this type of work as \"Focus Work.\" You can determine the activities that qualify as Focus Work in your settings and set goals for how much Focus Work you want to complete in a day.\n\nWhen you're ready to tackle this kind of deep work, you start a \"Focus Session.\" During this session, RescueTime blocks all websites that you've identified as personal activities (like social media sites or YouTube). It keeps track of how well you're concentrating, and at the end of the session, it will give you a detailed report.\n\nThere's a learning curve with RescueTime. You have to familiarize yourself with all these terms and how RescueTime defines and categorizes certain activities. But once you feel comfortable with the vocabulary and the settings, you won't have to tinker with much else and can immediately dive into your deep work.\n\nThis is also the only app in this roundup that doesnot let you export your hours or automatically create an invoice. RescueTime is for the person who wants to track their hours worked for their own benefit, learning more about their working habits and how to optimize their productivity.\n\nOne word of warning: when you sign up for RescueTime, you're given the option to choose your priority (\"Focus\" or \"Analytics\"). RescueTime's strengths lie in its focus-friendly features, so if you try it, I recommend choosing Focus when you sign up. I tried Analytics at first, and I wasn't impressed. Going that route, I missed out on the active coaching included in the desktop version of the Focus app. Instead, the desktop app was very minimalist, directing me to a browser dashboard where I could see a list of my activities—but without the easy categorizing and exporting functionality that I found with an app like Timely.\n\nAlso, while RescueTime has recently implemented a new \"Timesheets AI\" feature that lets you categorize your tracked time into projects, I found it to be a little too clunky for daily use. Maybe after a few updates, RescueTime will become the perfect dual distraction reducer and timesheet log. But for now, it's a great choice for reducing distractions and gamifying focus.\n\nYou can do even more with RescueTime by using RescueTime's Zapier Integrations. Zapier can connect RescueTime to all the other apps you use, so you can spend more of your time on that Focus Work.\n\nWho RescueTime isn't right for: Users who want to easily track time for individual projects and tasks.\n\nRescueTime pricing: Free Lite plan for individuals, which doesn't include activity blocking, advanced reporting, goal setting, or offline time entry. RescueTime Premium starts at $12/user/month.\n\nWhat makes the best time tracker?\n\nThe right time tracking app takes the guesswork out of scheduling and accounting for your workday. Easily start and stop timers, add or edit time entries manually, and export or review your data for more accurate invoicing and planning. And you can save even more of your valuable time by automating the data flow between your other apps and your time tracker of choice. That way, you're spending your time where it matters most.\n\nRelated reading:\n\nThe best meeting schedulers\n\nThe best AI scheduling assistants\n\nThe best time blocking apps\n\nTimesheet templates to help you track your time",
      "# [Best time management app of 2024 by Jonas P. DeMuro, Craig Hale on 2022-05-22](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-time-management-solution)\nWe list the best time management apps, to make it simple and easy to manage and track time, tasks, and improve productivity goals for yourself or employees.\n\nThis is important, because time management is an essential skill to learn when involved with running a business, department, or other managerial duties.\n\nMany workers find that they struggle to fit in all their designated work into a day, with some studies uncovering the alarmingly high amount of time we spend in (often pointless) video calls each week - accounting for an estimated fifth of our time. A good time management app will help any individual to understand their working day and prioritize the right tasks as they reach optimal workload management, but it should also be easy to use without adding to the burden.\n\nMost of the apps we looked at offer individual as well as team tracking, and provide features for tracking time not least for counting billable time, Internet use, and time spent on an individual project. This can be useful for a variety of working types, ranging from businesses to self-employed workers who want to get a better understanding of how they spend their time to be able to generate more accurate invoices for clients.\n\nSome have goals built into them, or general analysis of time used through the day, to help you better identify time sinks and lazy periods when you can be more productive.\n\nWhere team features are available, this allows you to compare your own performance with others from your team, and use insights into how to not just better manage your own time, but how others in the team can learn from each other to do the same.\n\nHere then, are the best time management apps currently available in 2024.\n\nWe've also featured the best accounting software for small business.\n\nThe best time management apps of 2024 in full:\n\nBest time management app for automation\n\nTimecamp has a number of simple-to-use functions related to time tracking aimed at maximizing team productivity. The feature set includes billable time tracking, sending invoices based on time spent, an attendance tracker, and team time tracking.\n\nThere is also automated time tracking which can be used for employee Internet usage monitoring, and to assign an entry to the correct project. The time management software function puts this all together to be able to track a team’s time spent on a project, and also their productivity.\n\nAdmins can also benefit from reporting to help them understand how their time is being spent. Not only does this provide insight into workers’ efficiency, but it can be a valuable tool for tracking projects that are run by different funding pots, which is a very common scenario in non-profit organizations that receive funding from grants.\n\nIt also can integrate with over 50 productivity tools for ease of use, including project management tools like Airtable, Asana, and Monday.com, as well as communication and video conferencing platforms like Teams and Slack, accounting software like Xero, and numerous calendar apps.\n\nThere is a free tier for limited use as it only supports a single user. The next higher plan is the Basic tier, which has no limit on the number of users, supports billable time functions and offers both a monthly and annual subscription. There are also Pro and Enterprise plans for larger organizations.\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nBest time management app for mobiles\n\nWonder no more “where the day has gone,” with the Chrometa software that can capture automatically the tasks that you and your team work on. It does this by capturing the URL of the website that you visit, the subject and addressee information from an email, and the file info when working on a local file - and stops the clock when you go away from the computer. It can also track things like mouse movements across Windows and macOS devices, which can be a good way of monitoring pauses but may raise some privacy concerns.\n\nThere’s also an emphasis on finances, with features like budget monitoring and the promise of minimizing admin costs. There’s a healthy number of integrations, including numerous finance-related ones like Quickbooks, Xero, and Freshbooks, however beyond this, it doesn’t quite meet the level of other rivals.\n\nThis time management app also captures, via Android and iOS apps, phone calls and text messages to turn time on a mobile device into billable time as well.\n\nThere is the offer of a 30-day free trial, but no free plan so it’s not necessarily a cost-effective solution for smaller businesses. There are three tiers, each with differing numbers of supported devices, data storage, and levels of support. They’re billed on a per-user basis.\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nBest time management app for multiple devices\n\nToggl takes a simplistic approach to time management, with included tracking reminders, and idle detection to make sure the job gets done which can be especially useful for remote workers who find themselves getting distracted. It also has cross-platform support, so for example, time tracking can begin in the browser of a desktop PC, and then be stopped on a smartphone with time entries synced between devices; there are mobile apps and browser extensions to accomplish this, but you won’t have a large pick of the best browsers: only Chrome and Firefox are supported.\n\nToggl also makes it simple to break down your hours worked, by either the project, the client, or the task, and can then analyze them to determine which is making the best return for the hours spent to facilitate maximizing profits. The Toggl app is simple, but unfortunately, it does not support invoicing.\n\nThere’s Sign in with Google support which could suit a large number of businesses using Google Workspace, and also Sign in with Apple for those tied into the Apple ecosystem.\n\nIntegrations are aplenty and include services from Zoho, Asana, Adobe, and Google. There’s also an API available to be able to track something that Toggl Track doesn’t already support, making it one of the most powerful tools out there.\n\nA free tier for up to five workers is available, along with a pair of paid plans and an Enterprise plan that can be customized. Pricing is fairly average, though not cheap, but there are savings to be had for annual subscriptions. All plans also come with a 30-day free trial with no payment card required, so you can really get to know the time tracker before committing to any big spends.\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nBest time management app for currency support\n\nFor freelancers and companies alike, Tmetric dubs itself a ‘work time tracker,’ which via a clean interface provides “great control over time intervals and project budgets.” The key is a visual timeline that gives insight into the activities throughout the day, which you can turn into billable hours.\n\nTmetric boasts over 40,000 users, and over nine million hours of time tracked, including time off, team management, and reporting for all tiers (to varying degrees).\n\nThe process can be automated as there are browser add-ons to directly and seamlessly capture every minute of data to feed back into Tmetric, which is then tracked, to totally capture each and every billable minute. It also benefits from compatibility with all major PC and mobile operating systems, including Linux, so most businesses should be able to use it in some form.\n\nFurthermore, there is support for different currencies, and the ability to track costs per team, to help maximize income while keeping projects within a predefined budget. Finally, tasks can be tracked by individual team members to follow their productivity, and compared to their peers.\n\nThis flexible time management app has a free tier that supports up to 5 users. The Professional tier is available which adds billable rates, invoicing and to-do lists. The top tier Business plan adds Timesync with Jira and Redmine, and can provide cost rates for employees. Both paid plans have a 30-day free trial available, and there are discounts for annual subscriptions.\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nBest time management app for focus\n\nRescueTime has the laudable goal of eliminating distractions and focusing on productivity. It is quite feature-rich and allows you to set goals, providing each user with feedback such as alerts when daily goals have been met.\n\nBesides the features you’d expect, there are some health-focused additions like daily focus and coaching tips. In fact, the company claims that driving for sky-high productivity can become toxic, and is an advocate of the four-day working week.\n\nThere is a free plan called RescueTime Lite that can track time used on websites, set goals, and even provides a weekly email report. More serious time management aficionados can step up to the sole choice of a paid plan, known as RescueTime Premium.\n\nRescueTime tracks what you're working on and will let you know if you're trying to do too much at once or otherwise losing focus. We think it's one of the best time management apps for helping you stay on task.\n\nIt’s worth noting that, while there’s support for both of the leading operating systems, Windows users will need to be running Windows 10 or later. That should be fine, because figures suggest that many businesses are sticking to 10 and taking a more cautious approach to Windows 11, though there may still be some organizations that require older operating systems. macOS support extends back to 2016’s 10.12 Sierra.\n\nThe paid plan builds on the free offering with additional features including tracking time away from the computer (such as phone calls), keeping a log of daily accomplishments, and the ability to block distracting websites. There is a free 14-day trial for the paid tier. Additionally, users will have the pick of a modern-looking “New RescueTime” or the detailed “RescueTime Classic,” though it’s unclear how long both will be supported.\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nBest time management app for security\n\nDo you need a time management app that allays your privacy concerns about sending data to the cloud? ManicTime is downloadable software that is run locally and keeps its data local and does not connect to some remote server. You’ll be fine if you use Windows, macOS, and even Linux, but mobile support only extends to Android users so workers conducting business from their iOS devices won’t be able to benefit from it.\n\nJust like the cloud-based solutions above, it can automatically keep track of time spent, whether on a local file, or through a website. ManicTime also integrates with task-based systems, like Github or Jira. The software can also be used for creating timesheets for workers who need to report back to a manager, for example those working on multiple projects simultaneously.\n\nManicTime makes it easy to turn your tracked hours into custom reports, presenting any additional data you might require. These are formatted and ready for import into your preferred spreadsheet or invoicing software.\n\nThe software is available to download for a one-time fee, however support and updates are only supported for one year after which you can either carry on with the version you ended on or pay again to continue receiving updates.\n\nIf you like using ManicTime but decided you'd prefer a time management app with cloud functionality, there's a cloud-based version too, which works on an ongoing subscription basis.\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nBest lightweight time management app\n\nTicking off items on a to-do list is hugely satisfying, and is a time-honored way to manage your time and get more done during the day. While Todoist isn’t strictly a time-tracking app, it’s a perfect entry-level option for workers seeking to manage their allocation of work.\n\nTodoist is a simple but effective tool for desktop and mobile that lets you set recurring events and essential one-off tasks, and check them off once they're complete. You'll receive a schedule of jobs at the start of each day (unless you choose not to), giving you a sneak peak of what lays ahead so you can prioritize your work according to your schedule and preferences.\n\nTasks are collected in groups called 'Projects', though these might be more accurately called 'Activities'. The default options include shopping, personal, errands and work, and you can add or edit them to suit you.\n\nSome features are exclusive to the premium version, and unfortunately, you won’t always know until you try to select one, but the free version has plenty of tools to help you achieve more every day.\n\nIf you're looking for a more heavy-duty tool for tasks with multiple parts and deadlines, take a look at Trello. It's generally a better tool for business use, whereas Todoist is perfect for your own personal tasks and better suited to individual, self-employed workers and small, close teams.\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nWe've also featured the best to do list apps.\n\nMore time management software options\n\nThere are a lot of software apps available for different aspects of accounts and productivity, and time management is no different. Here we'll feature a selection of additional platforms worth considering as well as those above:\n\nClockify is a simple time tracker and timesheet app for teams that has the distinction of also being free. While that usually means a trade-off in terms of features, Clockify manages to retain essential functionality. Aside from a time tracker and timesheets, it also provides the ability to set up and manage projects and teams, as well as a dashboard to provide an overview of projects as well as analytics based on use.\n\nFocusBooster is another paid time management app that offers simple time tracking as well as a to-do list and productivity reports. However, it takes a more unique approach in encouraging work in small bursts with breaks in between so that you can balance work with life and play. There's a free tier available, but even paid pricing remains relatively cheap depending on the number of features required.\n\nTick offers a more advanced time tracking solution for specifically working with teams, and offers mobile apps for use with Android and iOS as well as for desktop PCs. At its core is a time track which allows managers to then track budgets and profitability. Tick can also be integrated with other productivity software such as Basecamp.\n\nHubStaff is another managerial time tracking solution, offering a wide range of features such as timesheets, GPS tracking, team scheduling, productivity monitoring, and of course reporting for insights. You can import projects or start new ones, and begin time tracking from then. There's also a wide range of integrations available, from Asana to Zoho Projects.\n\nHarvest gears itself more toward larger companies, with customers including Volkswagen and Dell. There are desktop and mobile apps, and integrations with some key services like Google Chrome and GitHub. Admins can also manage projects and the software supports invoice issuing with companies like Stripe and PayPal. There’s a free version available, and the single paid tier also represents good value for money.\n\nProductive appeals to agencies with a variety of workers under their umbrellas, and has all the usual time tracking features. It markets itself as a “one-stop shop,” so you can also expect resource planning tools, budgeting, billing, reporting, and more. It’s not a particularly cheap piece of kit, but should help you eliminate the need for other software so may work out cheaper if you’re likely to use everything. A trio of paid tiers each with free trials and annual subscription savings are topped by a customizable enterprise plan\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nWe've also featured the best employee scheduling software.\n\nBest time management app FAQs\n\nWhat is a time management app?\n\nTime management apps come in various shapes and sizes, but they all have one thing in common. They track the time that you spend on activities you wish to track.\n\nThis is useful for businesses tracking hours worked by remote staff, or for freelancers who need to know how many hours they have spent working on a particular project.\n\nBeyond tracking hours, some time tracking apps can automatically generate invoices, give you tips on working more efficiently, and even warn you if you're losing focus.\n\nHow to choose the best time management app for you\n\nChoosing the best time management app for you starts with understanding how you want to use the data captured. If you want to track your own work and have no need for integration with other software, a no-frills free time tracker could be all you ever need.\n\nIndividuals who want an app that keeps them focused and helps with invoicing would be better served by a more advanced app. Similarly, business users who wish to track multiple employees will benefit from a cloud-based time management app with enhanced reporting features.\n\nShould I pay for a time management app?\n\nThere are some free versions available, but in the majority of cases you’ll find yourself paying for a time management app, especially if you need premium features like reporting, timesheets, billing, and so on.\n\nHowever, ask yourself whether it’s a time management app you need. Maybe your business could benefit from a scheduling app, or an employee scheduling app.\n\nHow we tested the best time management apps\n\nTo test for the best time management apps we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, whether as a download or as an online service. We then tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each software platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools. As well as comparing different price points, we compared time management apps with other, similar pieces of kit to help determine whether the features included represent good value for money, or whether they already come as part of another service you could already be paying for.\n\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\n\nGet in touch\n\nWant to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "# [10 Best RescueTime Alternatives by Madalina Roman on 2024-01-26](https://timeular.com/blog/best-rescuetime-alternatives/)\nIf you’re a RescueTime user, you have probably encountered some of its specific issues, like compatibility and flexibility. The very limited integration choice and the lack of customization of the activities make it difficult for users.\n\nRescueTime is primarily focused on personal productivity and not project tracking, and you might need a time tracking solution that you can use to track projects and the team’s progress. Also, RescueTime relies only on automated time tracking, while you might also need other time tracking methods.\n\nWith that in mind, you’ll thoroughly list the best RescueTime alternatives. For each one, there will be advantages and cons of usage so that you see which is the greatest alternative to improve your time management.\n\nThe 10 Top alternatives to RescueTime\n\n1. Timeular\n\nTimeular is the most versatile, secure, and smart time-tracking solution designed for teams powered by AI.\n\nOne of Timeular’s main benefits is that you can choose how you want to track time based on your preferences and needs, whereas RescueTime locks you into only one way of tracking.\n\nTimeular has its fair share of positive reviews since Capterra ranked this software with a 4.6 overall, with an 80% chance of recommendation, being declared a great tool to keep track of time.\n\nApple has also ranked Timeular with the same 4.6 points, with special attention to the balance between ease of use and its powerful features and reports.\n\nTop Timeular’s features\n\nAutomatic time tracking: Timeular turns your calendar events and app usage into suggestions with AI, and your timesheet will be automatically filled at the end of the day.\n\n100% Data security: Unlike RescueTime, Timeular stores your data on your computer, not in the cloud, and it is accessible only to you.\n\nIntuitive calendar view: Team members can easily add activities by dragging and dropping them on the calendar.\n\nPhysical time tracking cube: By leveraging muscle memory, Timeular helps users build a habit of time tracking through a physical device.\n\nLeave tracking: Easily manage and track all types of employee time off in one place: paid time off, sick days, time off in lieu, and many more.\n\nAutomated reports: This feature automatically fills timesheets for contributors, saving them time and effort.\n\nProductivity tracker: Measure and maximize your and your team’s performance with accurate data and actionable insights.\n\nAI time tracking software: Track time using AI time entry suggestions based on your calendar and past entries.\n\nIt provides both Mac time tracking and Windows time tracking.\n\nAdd notes and tags to time entries, and add more granularity to the time entries.\n\nCustom reminders to track time or take a break.\n\nTime tracking with a physical device\n\nTimeular is a time tracking solution widely known for its physical Timeular time tracker that connects to the app via Bluetooth. The Tracker works offline and can track up to 1000 activities with just 8 sides. Simply leave one or more sides of your Tracker empty. Every empty side will act like a joker side. It will open a pop-up and let you choose what you want to track.\n\nPlease note: You don’t need the Tracker to use Timeular software.\n\nI am not one that finds joy in tracking my time. Thankfully, I can now simply flip the Timeular Tracker.\n\nMelissa, Senior Analyst in Health\n\nRead also: How a software house tracks time against estimations to improve accuracy.\n\nWhy Timeular is the best RescueTime alternative:\n\nTrack time in your preferred ways- track time automatically, like RescueTime, or manually, with keyboard shortcuts, or with the Timeular Tracker.\n\nTimeular allows leave tracking, while RescueTime doesn’t.\n\nSuper easy and intuitive interface: see what you’ve tracked at a glance.\n\nProductivity insights: check when you are the most productive or unproductive in your dashboard and what apps consume too much time.\n\nMobile and desktop compatible: use this time tracking tool on your desktop and mobile to make your time tracking easier.\n\nAccurate reporting: thorough reporting that shares real-time data with insights that you need to make your decisions.\n\nData privacy and GDPR compliance: Timeular stores your data on your computer, not in the cloud,\n\nAnti-surveillance: track time without feeling spied on, as managers are allowed to check tracked data only at midnight.\n\nIntegration with tools: Integrate Timeular with your calendar and tools such as Trello, Asana, JIRA, and other 3,000 apps via Zapier.\n\nBudgets: Establish a time budget for each project that you’re involved in.\n\nExport and customize your data – you can export reports in CSV, XLSX, or PDF, and customize your report with multiple filters.\n\nVersatility: Timeular also works as a work hours tracker to record time spent on tasks, a timer app to apply to time blocks or the Pomodoro technique, and also as a time entry system to simplify payroll processes and management.\n\nAdd notes and tags to get more granularity on your task and categorize activities even better.\n\nTrack billable and non-billable hours with extra flexibility: the same activity can be tracked as billable or not simply by switching a toggle on.\n\nRead also: The guide about employee leave of absence\n\n2. Toggl\n\nThis is a popular and one of the greatest time-tracking software that aims to take care of your team’s time and productivity through an intuitive dashboard.\n\nToggl is a valid RescueTime alternative because you can use it both for individual and team purposes.

Founded in 2008, the company aims to provide insights into work habits, enabling users to identify distractions and improve productivity. The software operates in the background, automatically tracking time spent on applications and websites, and categorizing activities based on productivity levels. As of 2024, RescueTime offers both a free version (RescueTime Lite) and a premium subscription model.\n\n## Product Overview\n\n**RescueTime** is primarily known for its automatic time tracking capabilities. It provides users with detailed reports and insights into their daily activities, helping them to set goals and block distractions. Key features include:\n\n- **Focus Sessions**: Users can block distracting websites during designated work periods.\n- **Productivity Pulse**: A scoring system that rates productivity based on time spent on various activities.\n- **Daily and Weekly Reports**: Summaries that help users reflect on their productivity and identify areas for improvement.\n- **Integrations**: RescueTime can connect with tools like Slack and Google Calendar to enhance its functionality.\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### New Features and Integrations\n\n1. **Slack Integration**: As of May 2024, RescueTime has introduced an integration with Slack, allowing users to update their Slack status based on their work category. This feature enhances team communication by reflecting users' current focus areas in real-time [(RescueTime, 2024-05-23)](https://help.rescuetime.com/article/210-slack).\n\n2. **Team Reports**: In June 2024, RescueTime for Teams launched special group reports that provide aggregated statistics on how team members spend their time. This feature aims to foster transparency and improve overall team productivity without compromising individual privacy [(RescueTime, 2024-06-20)](https://help.rescuetime.com/article/35-team-reports).\n\n3. **Firefox Extension**: A new extension for Firefox was released in July 2024, allowing users on Mac OS to track their browser activity more effectively. This extension is crucial for users who want detailed insights into their web usage [(RescueTime, 2024-07-11)](https://help.rescuetime.com/article/115-installing-rescuetime-for-firefox).\n\n### Pricing Structure\n\nRescueTime offers two main pricing tiers:\n\n- **RescueTime Lite**: Free version with basic features for individual users.\n- **RescueTime Premium**: Priced at $12 per month or $78 annually, this plan includes advanced features such as Focus Sessions, detailed reporting, and integrations with other productivity tools [(Jibble.io, 2023-12-09)](https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime).\n\n## Market Position and Competitors\n\nRescueTime faces competition from various time-tracking and productivity tools, including:\n\n- **Toggl Track**: Known for its user-friendly interface and detailed reporting capabilities.\n- **Time Doctor**: Focuses on employee monitoring and productivity analysis.\n- **Everhour**: Offers robust project management features alongside time tracking.\n\nWhile RescueTime excels in automatic tracking and productivity insights, it lacks some project management features that competitors provide, which may limit its appeal to teams needing comprehensive project oversight [(Timeular, 2024-01-26)](https://timeular.com/blog/best-rescuetime-alternatives/).\n\n## User Feedback and Reviews\n\n### Positive Aspects\n\n- **Automatic Tracking**: Users appreciate the unobtrusive nature of RescueTime's tracking, which requires minimal manual input.\n- **Productivity Insights**: The detailed reports and productivity scores help users identify their most productive times and areas for improvement [(Jibble.io, 2023-12-09)](https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime).\n\n### Negative Aspects\n\n- **Mobile App Limitations**: Users have reported bugs and a less intuitive interface on mobile devices, which detracts from the overall experience [(Jibble.io, 2023-12-09)](https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime).\n- **Privacy Concerns**: Some users express discomfort with the level of tracking, fearing potential privacy invasions due to the comprehensive data collection [(Jibble.io, 2023-12-09)](https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime).\n\n## Executive Insights\n\nThe CEO of Jibble, Asim Qureshi, noted in a review that while RescueTime is effective for personal productivity, it lacks essential features for workforce management, such as invoicing and project tracking. He emphasized that RescueTime is best suited for individuals looking to enhance their productivity rather than teams needing comprehensive project management tools [(Jibble.io, 2023-12-09)](https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRescueTime is a powerful tool for individuals seeking to improve their productivity through automatic time tracking and insightful reporting. However, its limitations in project management and mobile functionality may deter teams looking for a more comprehensive solution. As the company continues to evolve and integrate new features, it remains a strong contender in the productivity software market, particularly for individual users and small teams focused on personal productivity enhancement. \n\n### Recommendations for Prospective Candidates and Investors\n\n- **For Candidates**: Consider the company's focus on innovation and user feedback as a positive indicator of its work culture and potential for growth.\n- **For Investors**: Evaluate the competitive landscape and RescueTime's unique positioning in the market, particularly its strengths in individual productivity, to assess potential investment opportunities. \n\n---\n\nThis report provides a detailed overview of RescueTime, highlighting its features, recent developments, market position, and user feedback.
