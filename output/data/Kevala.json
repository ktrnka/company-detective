This includes: (1) the âGDPRâ, the European Data Protection Law which stands for âGeneral Data Protection Regulationâ, with the official name Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council; (2) âPIPEDAâ (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), which is the Canadian Data Protection Law that applies to our activities in Canada; and (3) the California Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ) which applies to our activities in the United States. Kevala is committed to adhering to all these applicable Data Protection laws.\n\nâ\n\nâPersonal dataâ â this is information we collect from you or about you and which is defined in the GDPR as âany information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.â It can be as simple as your name or your email, or something more complicated like an online identifier (usually a string of letters and / or numbers) that gets attached to you. Under PIPEDA and the CCPA, the equivalent concept is âpersonal information,â which is roughly the same. Any mention of âpersonal dataâ in this Policy shall also mean personal information.\n\n2.

Boosting morale and providing hardworking care teams with a well-deserved break is essential, as they are vital to every healthcare organization.\n\nâ\n\nWe are incredibly willing to support LCCA in recognizing their staff's incredible work. Healthcare facilities like Life Care Center of Federal Way deserve a lot of credit for organizing such an exciting event for their staff.Â\n\nâ\n\nRyan had this to say about the whole event,Â\n\nâ\n\n\"Life Care Center of Federal Way wanted to say thank you to our partners at Kevala for helping us staff during our company's annual Facility BBQ! We had a total of 150+ people who came together to celebrate the buildingâs accomplishments during the Facility BBQ and it was a breath of fresh air to have everyone disengaged from the building for a short period of time to enjoy each otherâs company.\"\n\nâ\n\nWe at Kevala are happy to help our partners give their hardworking nurses and healthcare staff the recognition they deserve.Â"

I'm looking to get something like [ShiftMed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shiftmed.caregiverapp&hl=en_US&gl=US) or [CareRev](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.carerevolutions.carerev&hl=en_US&gl=US). I can't find anything like it, the closest I can get to is [Connecteam](https://connecteam.com/), but it seems more like a full staffing kind of thing not meant for tempoary staff. I assume something like ShiftMed or CareRev is created by developers just for that company, we are small so we don't have that kind of money.

In addition to a signature, you can customize that form with other text and fields. You can also mark shifts as open, but it won't allow them to assign themselves.

Based on three key factors: \n\n* A set of high material quality-of-life indicators coinciding  with moderate per-capita incomes, both distributed across nearly the  entire population of Kerala.\n* A set of wealth and resource redistribution programmes that have  largely brought about the high material quality-of-life indicators.\n* High levels of political participation and activism among ordinary  people along with substantial numbers of dedicated leaders at all  levels. Kerala's mass activism and committed cadre were able to function  within a largely democratic structure, which their activism has served  to reinforce.\n\nKerala's unusual socioeconomic and demographic situation was summarized by author and environmentalist [Bill McKibben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_McKibben):\n\n>Kerala, a state in India, is a bizarre anomaly among developing  nations, a place that offers real hope for the future of the Third  World. Though not much larger than Maryland, Kerala has a population as  big as California's and a per capita annual income of less than $300.   But its infant mortality rate is very low, its literacy rate among the  highest on Earth, and its birthrate below America's and falling faster.   Kerala's residents live nearly as long as Americans or Europeans.   Though mostly a land of paddy-covered plains, statistically Kerala  stands out as the Mount Everest of social development; there's truly no  place like it.\n\nI'm surprised I haven't seen it cited by more socialists and communists, since these policies were first created by a communist named EMS. Although I would like to see the capitalist perspective on this before calling it a success of socialism.\n\nSo, does it work? What has led to its success? Why hasn't it been emulated throughout India?\n\n## Comment ID fgizv5e with +22 score by [(XasthurWithin, Reddit, 2020-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgizv5e/) (in reply to ID eyrn7s):\n>I'm surprised I haven't seen it cited by more socialists and communists, since these policies were first created by a communist named EMS. \n\nIt makes for good agitprop, because it proves that a communist party is actually electable and doesn't immediately cause a famine or whatever when in power. Racist memes about street shitting in India are easily countered by demonstrating that it is communists who ended this. \n\nHowever, we shouldn't be dishonest: Kerala is at best a social democracy that is also financed a lot through remittances from Indian guest workers in the UAE and Saudi-Arabia. This is nothing the CPI(M) should be blamed for, as far as I can see it, they are still a revolutionary party, but they are doing what they can within in the constraints of an Indian state, but at least they're doing a much better job than the neoliberal hellscape that is imposed on the rest of India by the BJP.\n\n### Comment ID fgldhqe with +1 score by [(hungarian_conartist, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgldhqe/) (in reply to ID fgizv5e):\n>because it proves that a communist party is actually electable and doesn't immediately cause a famine or whatever when in power.\n\nNo it doesn't.

As background, I'm an American-born Indian who visits Kerala every year or so to see my relatives. Here are my observations. \n\nFirst, if you visit the area, you'll find scores of unemployed or underemployed men and women. \n\nSecond, the young people of Kerala (excepting those who are not particularly highly-educated and home-bodies) by and large seek to immigrate to the West for higher education; most do not come back. The region is experiencing a brain and talent drain. This is not sustainable in the twenty-first century.\n\nThird, starting a small business in the area is exceedingly difficult, as worker strikes, power outages, and labor shortages pose significant challenges to successful operation. \n\nFourth, many multinational corporations are hesitant about investing in the state given these conditions. \n\nFifth, many parts of Kerala would be considered risky for women to walk alone in, even during the daylight, as there is, unfortunately, a large contingent of unemployed men who seemingly have nothing better to do than make women feel uncomfortable; when my wife and I visited Kerala last January, she experienced this. \n\nSixth, and this is my anecdotal observation, alcoholism is a chronic problem in many households as the men do not have steady and sufficient employment. \n\nSeventh, if you ask Kerala expats who live in the United States whether they would ever go back and live in Kerala, the answer will virtually always be no. I asked my father if he would go back to Kerala, and while he occasionally makes statements about returning to the old country (which men of a certain generation do, I suppose), he would never follow through on this, a position held by many ex-Keralites. In my dad's words, even making minimum wage in America at Wal-Mart, while not ideal, would be better by sheer virtue of being in America. The safety-net in Kerala is only one in name and does not guarantee any upward mobility. At least in America, one can use the safety-net to move forward. In fact, this is what my parents, both of whom are Kerala expats, did in the 1980s. Their American success story is literally impossible to achieve in Kerala.\n\nSo yes, high literacy is great, but let us not be deluded into thinking that Kerala is a great success story. It is doing better than other parts of India, which is important, but this misses the existential and spiritual crisis one feels upon landing at the airport there.

Without these incentives, a government bureaucrat tends to look at local problems through the lens of \"good enough,\" as in \"these roads are good enough for us, why invest in paving them\" or \"these power cuts are fine, there aren't any factories depending on them.\"\n\n**Multinational corporations provide local employment.** If you step outside of the developed world for a moment, the average person works in an agriculture-related position. Almost 70% of the jobs found in the poorest countries of the world are based on this industry, compared to less than 5% which is located in the wealthiest nations in the world. Multinationals come in, offer higher wages (which are still low compared to global standards), then shift the standard of living. The average real wages have almost tripled since 2018 in the developing and emerging G20 countries since 2008. For example, India had the highest levels, achieving an index rating of 5.5 compared to the regional 3.7 average.\n\n**Multinational corporations help incentive improving the local infrastructure.** Similar to discussion from the first point, companies must have employees who can access job sites to become productive. That means an investment in the local infrastructure becomes necessary before operations even begin. Roads, bridges, and technology access are three of the largest barriers taken down when multinationals become active in a developing country. You’ll see education investments to improve labor skills, along with public transportation development and other unique needs that some nations may require. In Kerala, the shoddy infrastructure means that a major car company like Toyota would never come because power cuts and outages would be significantly disruptive to the regional supply chain. \n\n**Multinational corporations help diversify local economies.** Many parts of India rely on primary products for subsistence. These products tend to be related to agriculture-based industries. Multinationals provide the economies of regions in the developing world with more variety, creating diversity in local production levels. That reduces reliance on commodities which often have volatile prices because their supply and demand levels waiver so often.\n\nHappy to discuss this further, but these are the thoughts that immediately come to my mind regarding your first sentence. Yes, multinationals aren't perfect, and we can certainly list ways in which multinationals aren't great for the developing world. But, on the whole, they tend to be better than they aren't. \n\nKerala is slightly ahead of India in some areas, but to call it a success story is like saying a car with three flat tires is significantly better than a car with four flat tires. In my opinion, Kerala's story is tragic because, whereas other parts of India have lower literacy and higher infant mortality, those highly-literate Keralites leave home and never come back. Accordingly, the population demographics of Kerala have, and will continue to, become older and older. Again, this is not sustainable. Anecdotally, I would say Kerala has maybe twenty years left before it becomes like any other under-developing state in India.\n\n#### Comment ID fgkgzwv with +3 score by [(ReckingFutard, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgkgzwv/) (in reply to ID fgj01ue):\nIts unemployment rate is way above average.\n\n#### Comment ID fglcebn with +1 score by [(hungarian_conartist, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fglcebn/) (in reply to ID fgj01ue):\nKeralan economy is reliant on remittances from the young supporting parents by working overseas in the west or places like Saudi Arabia.

But it's not as great as often represented.\n\n**Low entrepreneurship**\n\nThe model is practically set to not reward risk taking behaviour such as entrepreneurship. In the short run, this doesn't make much difference. In the long run, this is severely detrimental to growth.\n\n**Low business friendliness**\n\nMultinational companies are less willing to invest in Kerala. Not surprising, since the govt does not have very friendly policy for businesses. So they invest in other places - Hyderabad, Bangalore, Delhi etc. \n\n**High brain drain**\n\nThis ties into the above two. If people don't have new and exciting avenues to work in, they leave. Kerala has one of the highest expat populations. A state that leaks resources like that will not continue this for long.\n\nThen there's the fact that there are a lot of other factors at play that you have ignored. \nIt is true that Kerala has a moderately rich populace. But it is also true that Kerala is a thin state on a sea shore, by which I mean to say that almost all the state has access to the sea, which automatically means greater prosperity. If it were land locked and had a similar accomplishment, now that would be quite a feat. A coastal state being richer than others, that's not really an anomaly. \n\n\nThen there's social reforms. Kerala boasts of a lot of social reformers, something the rest of India can not. This led to a breakdown of repressive social values. Couples with the fact that a lot of Malyali communities had a status of women unparalleled in the rest of India, Kerala had far higher *hands on deck*, as they say. \n\n\n*I'm posted in India and I have a Malyali girlfriend.*\n\n## Comment ID fgl0acs with +2 score by [(nedstarkin, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgl0acs/) (in reply to ID eyrn7s):\nJust to add one point here.

But now for what might be a bit of a hot take: new systems should never base themselves on any existent system, no matter how successful that system may be, at least not heavily. The circumstances in which systems come into being and function are always unique, and they can cause systems that would otherwise fail to be successful and systems that would otherwise be successful to fail. There are lessons to be learned from Kerala, and from Cuba, and Burkina Faso, and other countries. But using one as a model is dangerous business and individual examples of various systems in action are unreliable indicators of the viability of a certain method.

And who says the existence of a few minor successes proves we should all do it anyway, even if you could find a few?\n\n---\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism_in_Kerala\n\n\n> The Communist Party in Kerala is unique because it has functioned under the conditions of a liberal democracy, relying on success in multi-party elections to remain in power. **Unlike many other communist governments, the Communist Party of India (CPI) in Kerala did not crush political dissent**. \n\nGreat. A different kind of Communist party.\n\n> CPI's 1957 constitution stated it would allow the existence of opposing parties after it had parliamentary majority. Party leaders, like Namboodiripad, did not like the idea of using military force to remain in power because it would reflect poorly on the CPI as a whole on a global stage. This reliance on the people's opinions created a benevolent communist government, but it also made it more difficult to enact radical reforms. **Therefore, the reforms of the CPI in Kerala were mainly moderately socialist.**\n\nMaybe not Communist at all.\n\n---\n\n> **Agrarian reform**         \nOne of the major changes advocated by the CPI was the Agrarian Relations Bill, passed in 1961. The bill was intentionally moderate because those drafting it knew it would have to pass through many constitutional channels before it would be made into a law. Over 1,000 amendments were debated due to party divisions. **Though the bill was moderate, it still changed the farming system. It abolished feudalism and aimed to create a   \n ---> capitalist <---   \nagricultural system. The CPI did not push more radical Communist land reforms. Namboodiripad stated they would not attempt state ownership or collective farms because even though such ideas might appeal to intellectuals on a scientific basis, they would not actually help the peasantry in practice**. \n\nYes! They are not typical Communist morons and they know Marxist pseudo-intellectuals are full of shit.\n\n> The bill aimed to improve wages and working conditions as well as secure employment. Landlords were only allowed to work on their land if they paid compensation, which helped protect the tenants’ rights.\n\n---\n\n> **Industrial reform**       \n> As the CPI in Kerala was ultimately controlled by the federal government, its state plan depended on the funds it could raise independently. It struggled to industrialize and develop new manufacturing plants in Kerala throughout the 1960s while balancing out the disparities of industrialization. The CPI had Industries ministers who were responsible for industrial development. It also had an Industrial Development Cooperation that gave financial assistance to companies to help them startup new manufacturing projects. In the early 1970s, the CPI created two new corporations to help with industrial development: the Kerala Industrial and Technical Consultancy Organization and the Kerala State Electronics Development Corporation. These measures improved industry on a state level, but were less successful at the local level. **To revitalize local industry, the CPI launched an ambitious Four-Year Plan, perhaps modeling itself after Stalin's Five-Year Plans which Namboodiripad considered an inspiration. The Four-Year Plan involved district-level conventions to excite potential entrepreneurs since the government wanted more private investors to spur industry. These entrepreneurs were trained to set up their own industries.

Everything is bright and alive and dancing and the old world may seem swampy or stale. \n\nThe third eye on the other hand is associated with seeing in the most literal sense \"astral planes\" and their features and creatues, and even to those to whom it happened it's usually a temporary fleeting state and then it close and you are back again here on Earth.\n\n## Comment ID kqcq4g1 with +7 score by [(MindofMine11, Reddit, 2024-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqcq4g1/) (in reply to ID 1aqcn4y):\nThe deeper i dive in, the  less i want to be part of this materialistic world full of delusions.\n\n## Comment ID kqeanpt with +7 score by [(kaizenkitten, Reddit, 2024-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqeanpt/) (in reply to ID 1aqcn4y):\nNot mine, but a friend of mine did, and I wish it hadn't.  We started doing Zoom yoga together once a week during Lockdown, and then she started doing yoga every day.  So far so great.  I was super happy for her.  But she's really fallen down the mystic rabbit hole since then.  \n\nNow she's a professional Archangel Crystal Healer, and does zoom healing sessions for people with cancer.  \n\nShe's always been a little into mystical/spiritual things, so I know I can't blame the yoga entirely for this.  But I still feel like she wouldn't be in the same place today without it either.

One is when a new responsibility is trying to sneak its way into your job make sure to negotiate before taking it on.I can do this if X person does this, or just saying you don’t have time - especially for less important tasks. I communicate often with my manager to debate/offload these lower priority time killers. If one of these ends up on my plate I’ll often ignore it.\n\nI also just have the mindset that I’m working for 5 or 6 hours in a day so every minute I’m very productive - very few slack sessions bitching about work, reading articles, etc.\n\nOrganization wise I keep a really simple notebook with To-do reminders that I get from meetings, prioritize those and just knock them out one by one.\n\n## Comment ID kqdnw4c with +4 score by [(SquirrelWilling3585, Reddit, 2024-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqdnw4c/) (in reply to ID 1aqcn4y):\nIt could be yoga - but even if it’s not you may not find an exact answer. Many people (including myself) got advanced degrees to work in ultra competitive fields because it seemed “impressive” or were told it would be the “right thing” but since we were young we never questioned if this degree or career path was right for us. \n\nAfter a lot of self reflection (and serious burnout) I changed jobs and took a “demotion” when I switched companies because I found a role that I could make impact in, but I didn’t have to make it my whole life. I can’t say it was yoga specifically that helped me make that change, but yoga does help me self reflect\n\n## Comment ID kqc8c11 with +26 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqc8c11/) (in reply to ID 1aqcn4y):\nWhen you start to awaken spiritually certain things naturally start to fall apart in your life, for many it's toxic friends and family leaving, or quitting or being fired from certain jobs, your values change so that you are more in the moment and less pushed and pulled by all the different karmic cycles and mind traps all around you.

Conforming to social expectations, working a job that \"seems\" prestigious, successful. With yoga practice now you have more self awareness. Realizing all the things you believed you wanted are just what the environment told you, not necessarily your true desire. You're less driven by the ego. You dissolved the identities you attached yourself to. A husband, a provider, a successful worker. But after the letting go you haven't constructed a life based on this new awareness. It is confusing. This is time to be still. If you are able to not start another job so soon, take time to meditate and be in nature. Go explore. What is your Dharma? What is your heart felt desire? Let the answer come to you instead of mentally trying to think this through, as to not get latch to another idea that is not your own.\n\n## Comment ID kqh4yaw with +3 score by [(tobicouture, Reddit, 2024-02-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqh4yaw/) (in reply to ID 1aqcn4y):\nI sometimes feel like I could use a job I don't need to give a F about, like an office job, lol.

This type of cycle works so well for me. I feel myself getting exhausted by the end of a big project and that feeling 2 months off before the next one is exactly fitting with my lifestyle.

The rat race, especially in finance, always keeps moving the goalposts. It feels like you're never achieving anything. Plus, it's an incredibly materialistic and competitive environment. Maybe that's not what gives you purpose and meaning.\n\n\nPeople who find purpose and meaning in their work are always happier. I encourage you to seek out what is more meaningful to you.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can continue in your career, but to realize that you don't find purpose and meaning in it, and with that realization, categorize it a simply a livelihood, and seek out purpose and meaning in other activities."

      "# [Santi’s Health Status – Kevala Retreat](https://www.kevalaretreat.org/health/)\nAnemia (with shortness of breath, unusual fatigue) was discovered during my annual wellness check in mid-March. Exploring the cause of the anemia uncovered a mass in the cecum, which is being treated as high grade B-cell non-hodgkins lymphoma. The tumor is not nearly as large as the one found in 2010 and my health hasn’t deteriorated nearly as badly as then. However, I am 14 years older and a body can only take so much intensive chemo and all that entails. In-person teaching engagements were put on hold. On-line teaching will continue as much as possible. This page will update once or twice a week during treatment though July. Newest entries on top.\n\nFurther updates will be on https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/santikaro\n\n4. last weekend of April\n\nFeeling pretty good, all things considered, through 2nd chemo cycle at Mayo Clinic. Should go home Monday midday. Jo Marie and I had a long Friday with scan and lots of meetings, including prep for the stem cell “transplant/rescue.” We learned a lot about the latter, and have some clarification about the form of high grade b-cell lymphoma that occurred. It’s a little different than the tumor 13 years ago, and even more falls in-between the familiar forms of HGBCL. There are perhaps 50 documented cases of it.\n\nA third chemo cycle will start May 17. Ideally, the stem cell transplant/rescue process will start 4 weeks after that. We now, thanks to Dr Villasboas, have a pretty good idea of how that will play out. Expected to take 6 weeks, but could be longer or a little less. We are making the necessary logistical arrangements with family and friends. Preparing physically, emotionally, and Dhammically.\n\n3. third weekend of April\n\nBlood tests show that neutrophils and WBCs are coming back nicely, neutropenia is waning, and the immune system is functioning, though not fully up to speed. So I’ll have a few days of few meds, few side effects, low risk of infection, and much gratitude for a strong body that’s gotten through the first chemo cycle pretty well. Then, on Friday, we start the second cycle.\n\nMy primary duties will remain: eating as much and as well as I can, hydrating well, managing the meds, walking a lot, correspondence, and Dhamma practice.\n\nMany thanks to all the notes of condolence and warm well-wishing. Thanks, too, to everyone who contributed to the Guest House construction; it’s a wonderful place to recuperate and enjoy the valley views of springtime.\n\n2. mid-April\n\nA fever occurred when neutropenia arrived suddenly. I was hospitalized locally as a precaution to stabilize vitals and check for infections. Neutropenia is expected with this kind of intense chemo; neutrophils bottomed out at zero and started returning a day later. During the worst of neutropenia, there is extreme risk of infection, with sepsis a particular concern. Fortunately, the fever passed quickly and no infection has been found. Jo Marie brought me home on 4/17 after a few nights in La Crosse.",

      "# [Police: Yoga teacher booked for raping NRI multiple times by Coovercolly Indresh on 2024-09-04](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-yoga-teacher-booked-for-raping-nri-multiple-times-101725391142607.html)\nThe officer said that yoga instructor identified as Pradeep Ullal, 53, heads the “Kevala Foundation,” which has been running an ashram in Chikkamagaluru for two decades. He has been arrested on charges of raping an American doctor under the pretext of a spiritual relationship that he claimed existed between them in a previous life.\n\n“Based on complaint filed by NRI doctor, we booked Ullal under IPC section 376(rape) on Sunday and launched an investigation into the matter,’’ Chikkamagaluru rural police station inspector Sachin Kumar said. The police has registered the case under IPC as the alleged rape took place between 2021 and 2022.\n\nThe NRI doctor, a US citizen, came in contact with him through social media and started taking online yoga classes from the instructor. The survivor, originally from Punjab and now settled in California, filed a complaint at Chikkamagaluru Rural police station. She alleged that she was lured into Ullal’s spiritual teachings and later manipulated into visiting his yoga centre in Mallenahalli multiple times between 2021 and 2022.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the woman first came into contact with Ullal in 2020 through a mutual friend. She began practising yoga under his guidance online and was later invited to visit his centre in Mallenahalli. During her first visit on November 1, 2021, she stayed for 21 days. It was during this time that Ullal allegedly began his manipulation, convincing her that they had a deep, spiritual connection from a previous life, the woman alleged in her complaint.\n\nShe alleged that Ullal, under the guise of performing “energy work”, and sharing “divine love” coerced her into sexual acts, claiming these were necessary for her spiritual progress. She returned to California and was called to Mallenahalli again in February 2022, where she stayed for 10 days. During this period, she alleged that Ullal raped her multiple times.\n\nThe survivor stated that she visited the centre again in July 2022 for a 21-day stay, during which she was raped two or three more times. The woman also revealed that she became pregnant as a result of the assaults and unfortunately, the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. Ullal the allegedly manipulated the situation further, referring to the ordeal implying that such events were divinely orchestrated, she alleged.\n\nIn addition to the physical and emotional abuse, the woman also claimed that she had been financially exploited by Ullal. She alleged that she had given him gifts worth approximately ₹20 lakh, including a music system, Kashmiri carpets, two laptops, and various other items. She said that Ullal had deceived many people by presenting himself as a spiritual guide and yoga instructor, police said.\n\n“Followed by complaint, we arrested Pradeep Ullal and produced him before JMFC court Chikkamagalurui ‘’ investigation officer Sachin Kumar told HT. “He has hundreds of followers. We are investigating whether he was involved in similar incidents in the ashram. Currently he is in judicial custody.”\n\nWhen HT attempted to contact Kevala foundation, none picked phone.",
      "# [Kevala Foundation by admin on 2010-04-20](https://kevalafoundation.org/be-aware/)\nDear Friends,\n\nThere are several questions unanswered by spiritual gurus who masquerade as messiahs of the lord and take advantage of hapless devotees.\n\nThe current scandals add fuel to pertinent questions that surface whenever the so called saviours of humanity ditch their own ideals and assume that they are above all laws of karma, universe and claim their stature of enlightenment, which by no means is proven.\n\nSpirituality is a hazy battleground where there is no clarity for seekers and the game gets murkier when leaders themselves don’t know where they are headed.\n\nUnder the current scenario, its important to throw more light on this topic and awaken the powers of our intellect to discern between the fakes and our true guru within, which is our own soul, driven by our conscience.\n\nLet these provoking questions and contemplations help us explore further. This is a long mail. Read it fully at your leisure. I trust that it will resonate with the exploring spirit that is desperate to burst open to find out the truth.\n\n1. It becomes really evident that even the current crop of self-proclaimed greatest masters on this planet have no clue about their own future and what the universe has in store for them. Paramahamsa Nityananda claimed he has 360 degrees vision and can see through with clarity of his third eye and ultra-sensitive higher sense perception. This hyped skill fell short to identify the hidden video cam in his own ashram bedroom. His strong intuition failed to identify that he has bred foes in his own ashram by his autocratic style of leadership. He didn’t even foresee that he would be caught in the act on camera and would force him to escape from cops, and his own people. I haven’t met anyone who knows the entire picture of what future has in store for them how destiny is in a state of flux. But that doesn’t stop them from predicting other’s future.This reiterates adage that the universe remains a mystery that changes itself when it knows that someone is trying to know it. There is a saying that ‘Grace descends and man ascends’, but when the ascended man falls from elevated grace owing to his own misgivings, the fall becomes really nasty.\n\n2. Living with an enlightened master is apparently just a hyped marketing concept, as it turned out to be shocking experience for all the hapless aspirants. No one got to know that the private life of Swami Nityananda was a closely guarded secret and no one would ever get to know what it is to live with their master, while the glorified darshans would serve as a wow factor with the good looking swami decked up in gold, perched on an emperor’s seat and spewing commentaries on ancient vedas, yoga and shiva sutras. Little did the aspirants of Inner Awakening know that they would be rudely awakened by the sleazy happenings at Ananda Gandha- the quarters of the Swami. By looking at the sad faces of the volunteers in the ashram, it becomes very clear that someone has robbed them of their happiness, and their ananda is a concept meant to be sold to masses and not experienced amongst themselves.\n\n3. A great teacher like Osho Rajneesh was a creative genius who didn’t have to rely on just being a narrator of ancient wisdom which is made available by several great masters from the past. There is hardly anything new in Nityananda’s teachings, apart from re-packaging ancient philosophies with his lucid style of commentary. If you want to know in-depth about shiva sutras, just refer the ‘Book of Secrets’ – interpretation of vigyan bhairav tantra by Osho (audio also available) and you will get a clear comparison in difference in the levels of expertise and treatment of the meditation techniques (between osho and swami nityananda).\n\n4. Despite failures and misgivings of hundreds of cults in the past, the spiritual leaders continue to create autocratic institutions and design them into a neo-cult, so that they control their mesmerized followers, and drive the insiders by a hierarchical order that is subtly dictated by assumed slavery and obviously coded by color of skin, robes and fancy sanskrit names to define the cult.\n\n5. The scant disregard for true seekers of the these enlightened gurus becomes evident when politicians, film stars, VIPs get special treatment and long drawn private darshans while devotees in genuine need of support are standing in serpentine queues till wee hours of the night to get a thumbing on the forehead and false promises of boons. There is an obvious disparity in the way people are treated based on who they are and spiritual guidance always takes a back seat. The boom of youtube videos, spiritual channels on DTH TV only served as intelligent marketing communication vehicle for popularity, while the awe struck sadhakas beeline at ashrams only to discover that they are reduced to a frenzied fan in a mass hysteria ceremony to highlight the importance of the enlightened master. No one is allowed to ask any relevant question that can challenge the superiority of the master on any subject. You can expect to be promptly snubbed or thrown out by the ardent followers, if you doubt the integrity or skills of the master.\n\n6. Does a Master need to call himself one, if so, what mastery are we talking about. If we go to a traditional martial arts school, we can expect to see an expert who can willingly demonstrate feats that most trained people cannot perform. So the expertise is evident. But does that make him a master. There is always someone who is better than us and there is room for excellence and it never will be enough perfection. The disgusting aspect of so called spiritual masters is that they choose to vocalise their so called unseen skills rather than demonstrate it. Swami Rama of Himalayan tradition had the skills to demonstrate his amazing yogic powers at Merringer Research Institute in USA. These feats were super human and never recorded earlier in lab environment and hence revered by scientists. Despite such powers, Swami Rama never claimed that he was a Master and said that he is only a messenger from himalayas. The very term Master is pretty much abused. A true master doesn’t need to demonstrate his powers as he never claims to be a master. So there is no need for him to showcase his skills to win some students or please an audience. In the presence of an accomplished master, the expansion of our energies is obvious. For instance, the kundalini shakti instantly rose in people who were in the company of Ramana Maharishi. He was not even looking at his raving audience, his eyes were transfixed on the Arunachala hills, while he basked in Turiyeeta avasta (4th state of consciousness). Just his mere presence was enough while he made no claims nor mislead or persuade anyone.\n\nZen philosophy says we that a Master begins his day by being a student. This is called a Beginner’s Mind.\n\n7. Nityananda has claimed in his talks and books that ‘enlightenment’ is a big and serious responsibility and hence he has a immense task on hand. Now it is glaring that he has shockingly escaped his responsibility. He owes a response to his ardent followers and media. He has gone missing while no one knows his whereabouts. This is pathetic, considering the unofficial claims that he has 45 lakh followers in 17 countries. A captain of a ship will never abandon his ship, even if it is sinking. That’s why he is revered for that call of duty. Nityananda escaped when his ashrams and integrity were under threat. There is undoubtedly fear in his reactions. If the ashram vouches that the sex video is doctored and morphed, so why is their leader running away. Any person with a room temperature IQ having met the swami can make out that its the original swami exposed, If there is a body double that is lurching in the ashram, then Nityananda has to be really worried. Because the next inner awakening course will be conducted by some xyz-Ananda claiming to be the original Nityananda, who is going to mess with your happiness.\n\n8. There are hundreds of highly accomplished yogis meditating in the secluded caves of himalayas who never come into the open or sell their skills. They are truly blessing the world without any need for any recognition or fame. Such is our naivety that we get sold over to the large and popular institutionalized cult concepts. For instance 2012 has been enforced upon us as a cosmic event that is going to be impacting our consciousness. All these self-proclaimed saviours like Nityananda, Kalki Bhagwan and many such teachers have promised enlightenment for their thousands of devotees. Sadly for them, the universe had something else in store for them. They got busted in 2010, long before they could even imagine, what was going on or what hit them. As Ramana Maharshi also observed that the events are unfolding and we are witnessing without any control over them.\n\n9. Many skilled teachers have a humble beginning when they start imparting their skills to a few students. However the greed of power, money and fame overrides and their mission gets corrupted with the entry of unscrupulous ideas to make a quick buck in the name of charity. Many people pay hefty sums of money to get awakened but they become victims of a ‘cognitive dissonance’ which forces them to fabricate their experiences to match with the expectations of their peers.\n\n10. If you are going to be sitting in the midst of a 1000 plus, inspired chanters, the sheer collective consciousness and the group energy will bring about amazing sensory experiences in us. Its pure science, our electro-magnetic field is altered, this impacts our flow of prana, movement of chakras, and leads to temporary shift in our bio-energy. The hungry cult gurus cash on these personal experiences and quickly declare you awakened, only to disappoint you that this euphoria is not going to last, as you will need several more engineered courses to achieve enlightenment.\n\n10. Bharatkhand (as indian sub-continent is called) has been the spiritual engine of the world. We have a heritage that has been inspiring us. The contributions from the great Vedic Rishis, Mahavatar Babaji, Adi Shankaracharya, Patanjali, Chaitanya, Ramana Mahrishi, Shirdi Sai Baba, Bhagawan Nityananda (ganeshpuri), Gorakshnath, Ma Anandamayi, Siddhars, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Lahiri Mahasaya, Bengali Baba, Osho Rajneesh and so on, did not have to brag about their skills or stature but remained in the purity of their mission to awaken aspirants on their path to realize the true nature of the soul.\n\nInteresting Swami Nityananda once made an open statement the great Mahavatar Baba is his marketing agent, a haughty statement.\n\n11. There is nothing wrong in sex. Its a natural fountain of life like Food, Self Preservation, and Sleep. Sexual urge is so powerful that it can out-stage all idealisms and cultivated disciplines. However the claim that Paramahamsa, the eternal symbolism of sacred swan that doesn’t even land on the planet earth and claims that Nityananda was enlightened even before he even reached the age of puberty, hence does not need to indulge in sex was propagated. This raises the expectations out of a sacred celibate. Nityanandam – his blissful state of mind was celebrated in dozens of lilting musical compositions sold in audio cds. Why would a state of eternal bliss (that spiritual seekers are dying to achieve) fall prey to a 20 second sexual orgasm that any lowly mortal can achieve is an answer that Nityananda owes to everyone.\n\nHis teachers even made open claims during Kalpataru programs that by chanting ‘Om Hreem Nityanandaya Namah’, you will achieve the phenomenal Ashta Siddhi (super normal powers of control over space, time, nature, body, and so on). I bet not a single ashramite has achieved any of these siddhis.\n\n12. Nityananda definitely has some demonstrated meditative skills. For instance, ability to show no activity in the brain was demonstrated by bring the Beta, Alpha, Theta, Delta and Gamma brain waves to Zero activity on the EEG instrument. For your knowledge there are Meditators like Ken Wilber who have demonstrated the same skills. He has made no claims to enlightenment. You can see his videos on youtube.\n\n13. On the occasion of 60th birthday celebrations of Kalki Bhagwan. there was a live video to be webcasted. The video was subscribed over zealously on the net and promptly the video frames froze and no one could see the live video. Interestingly just before the video was to be telecasted, one of his top Dasaji made some glorious statements about Bhagwan and went to the extent of saying that his Bhagwan was not even born out of human womb, and I also read incredible statement from an official website that Kalki Bhagwan has created the entire universe. It would be extremely disappointing for any awakened devotee to learn that their God was not even capable of overcoming the network bottleneck on a celebrated occasion. Interestingly the devotees were all in anticipation for the expected boons from Bhagwan on his birthday as promised. Deservingly, even the ever-penetrating golden balls remained dormant in their own little universe created at the oneness university in India. In a human body, we can have human experiences, not necessarily spiritual experiences. All these teachers are human like us, who have walked a few more steps ahead of us, which doesn’t qualify them to have the entire universe in their control or know everything. They are as fallible, insecure, fragile and human like us. So why are we so bent upon creating super heroes, demi-gods and idols by chasing some idealism that is far-fetched for own good.\n\n14. History has its way of repeating itself. Many fake swamis with their strong political nexus have bounced back from thunderous scandals and resumed their operations. There is drift in our way of life that is triggered by global recession, political upheavals, natural calamities, guru busting, etc. No one has a complete picture what is in store for future. The sooth sayers, clairvoyants, and self proclaimed masters are as clueless as we are. We can live our lives with little awareness, one moment at a time, and stay connected positively for a common good of humanity. Let the trust within us become even more reinforced with the true GURU within each of us. The universe works through people. We have to thank a few people who put their lives at stake and expose the monsters hiding in the mask of demi-gods.\n\nPS: I have no claims to any official sources of information or direct knowledge, nor written this to influence anyone to deviate from their life choices, beliefs or way of living. However I pray that each one of us will muster the courage to ask all the troublesome questions now, and seek clarity amidst all these confusions.\n\nBreath is our prayer,\n\nMeditation is our path\n\nConsciousness is our God\n\nHumanity is our Religion\n\nLove, Light, Consciousness\n\nDr.Pradeep Ullal",

      "# [Distribution Planning by Test Auth](https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/industries-and-topics/electrical-energy/infrastructure/distribution-planning)\nThis track focuses on the near-term development and enhancement of the adopted DRP frameworks, analytical tools, and planning processes into a more comprehensive DPP.\n\nPhase 1\n\nStaff Proposal\n\nImprovements to the distribution planning and project execution process, interconnection capacity analysis maps, and data portals\n\nThe Staff Proposal examines issues with the current distribution planning process, focusing on issues that may contribute to long energization timelines. Staff propose methodological improvements and new processes to enhance proactive planning, which will be critical for the timely energization of the new loads expected from electrification and the increase in DERs. It also aims to improve the usefulness of the data portals and ICA tools for DER planning, siting, and interconnection, and to improve the design and ease of use of these tools.\n\nStaff Proposal Workshop: Wednesday, March 27 2024, 1pm – 4pm\n\nThe goal of the workshop is to present the High DER Staff Proposal to stakeholders and the broader public, and to give an opportunity for verbal questions and comments. This workshop will allow stakeholders and the public to better understand the Staff Proposal, and thus to submit more informed and complete official comments.\n\nAgenda\n\nPresentation\n\nWorkshop Recording\n\nCPUC Releases Proposed Decision to Improve the Utility Planning (R.21-06-017)\n\nOn September 13, 2024, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) released a Proposed Decision to approve new planning and execution processes for Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric.\n\nGoal: Make planning for the electric grid more proactive so that upgrades to the grid can keep up with\n\nincreasing demand and the growth of electric usage.\n\nResult: A reduction in the number of customer projects that have to wait for upgrades before they can be completed.\n\nThe Proposed Decision also includes improvements to technical maps known as integration capacity analysis (ICA) to help customers find the best places to install distributed energy resources, like solar panels.\n\nProposed Decision\n\nFact Sheet\n\nElectrification Impact Study (EIS) Part 1\n\nThe Electrification Impact Study Part 1: Bottom-Up Load Forecasting and System-Level Electrification Impacts Cost Estimates [link to CPUC Cover Sheet Kevala EIS Part 1 (ca.gov)] was filed in a May 9th, 2023, ruling in the High DER proceeding. EIS Part 1 examines the potential impacts of high adoptions of DERs on the distribution grid. The study presents a granular bottom-up load forecasting methodology that provides information on where and when distribution grid enhancements and investment may be needed to support grid reliability and provides a preliminary estimate on the potential costs of meeting these needs by California’s three largest investor-owned utilities (IOUs).\n\nThe Electrification Impact Study Part 1 Workshop was held on May 17th, 2023.\n\nAgenda\n\nPresentation\n\nRecording\n\nData Portals\n\nData portals hosted by PG&E, SCE, and SDG&E provide extensive geospatial mapping data to the public about the electric distribution grid. The purpose of the portals is to support DER siting. Among the data hosted are Integration Capacity Analysis (ICA) data, which are designed to help contractors and developers identify project sites where existing grid infrastructure has capacity available to interconnect new DERs. A January 27, 2021 Ruling for the DRP proceeding directed the IOUs’ to refine their ICA online maps to ensure the data are accurate and increase usability.\n\nPG&E’s data portal is available here.\n\nSCE’s data portal is available here.\n\nSDG&E’s data portal is available here.\n\nData validation were prepared for PG&E, SCE, and SDG&E pursuant to the January 27, 2021 Ruling. A September 9, 2021, Ruling required refinements to the data portals.\n\nData Portals Workshop\n\nThe CPUC held a Data Portals Improvement Workshop on July 26, 2022. This workshop informed participants about the utility data portals, which include the Integrated Capacity Analysis, Grid Needs Assessment, and Locational Net Benefit Analysis. The panelists shared feedback received to date on how to improve the data portals and solicited feedback from workshop attendees. The discussion included information about the grid planning in California.\n\nAgenda\n\nPresentation\n\nProceeding Documents\n\nDistribution Planning Community Engagement Needs Assessment Workshop\n\nThe CPUC held a workshop on December 13th, 2022. The workshop objectives were to: (1) present information received through a series of informal outreach meetings; (2) discuss a draft Scope of Work for a Distribution Planning Community Engagement Needs Assessment study to inform Track 1 of the proceeding with additional scope to support Track 2 outreach; and (3) provide context about existing utility distribution planning processes and community outreach.\n\nAgenda\n\nWorkshop Recording Part 1\n\nWorkshop Recording Part 2\n\nDraft Scope of Work\n\nCombined Presentations\n\nLoad ICA Refinements Workshop\n\nEnergy Division (ED) invited stakeholders to attend the all-day Load ICA Refinements Workshop on March 8, 2023\n\nWorkshop Agenda - available here\n\nWorkshop Presentation\n\nJoint IOU Presentation\n\nPhase 2\n\nDistribution Planning Process Improvements\n\nDistribution Investment Deferral Framework\n\nThe DIDF is an ongoing annual process to identify, review, and select opportunities for competitively sourced distributed energy resources to defer or avoid utility traditional distribution capital investments. DERs as alternatives to traditional grid investments are commonly referred to as non-wires alternatives. The DIDF was established in decision D.18-02-004.\n\nThe process requires annual filings by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE), and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E). The annual filings are called Grid Needs Assessment and Distribution Deferral Opportunity Reports (GNA/DDORs). Within the filings, the three utilities propose a list of DER opportunities most likely to successfully defer a traditional grid investment. An advisory group of stakeholders called the Distribution Planning Advisory Group reviews the GNA/DDOR filings. After review, the utilities seek to procure DERs for the selected opportunities.\n\nExtensive information about the DIDF process is provided in the implementing decision and the series of Administrative Law Judge rulings that refined the process. The Rulings are available at the DRP proceeding website (R.14-08-013). A summary of process updates and outcomes is provided in California’s Grid Modernization Report prepared by the CPUC.\n\nThe section addresses high-level policy issues concerning the roles and responsibilities of distribution system operators, as well as utility and aggregator business models. This track tackles long-term policy matters and may lead to findings that require action beyond the timeframe of this OIR.\n\nFuture Grid Study\n\nIn August 2023, the CPUC released an Amended Scoping Memo in Rulemaking R.21-06-017. The amended scoping memo alters Track 2 of the rulemaking by assuming that the electric investor-owned utilities (IOUs) remain in their current role as distribution system operators. The Future Grid Study is now based on the following two scoping questions:\n\n1. What are the operational needs necessary to efficiently operate a high DER grid, unlock economic opportunities for DERs to provide grid services, limit market power, reduce ratepayer costs, increase equity, support grid resiliency, and meet State policy objectives?\n\n2. What are the existing gaps and barriers in achieving the needs identified above within our current Distribution System Operator (Utilities)? What are the potential solutions in overcoming these barriers?\n\nTrack 2 of the rulemaking now focuses on how to ensure DER deployment provides the maximum possible value to the grid through effective distribution system operations. To tackle this, the Future Grud Study Workshop Series was hosted by Gridworks and the CPUC to foster collaboration and innovation amongst the IOUs. The workshop series will consist of three workshops:\n\nWorkshop Series: The Future Grid Study\n\nWorkshop 1: Identifying Operational Needs\n\nFebruary 8th, 2024, from 1:00pm to 5:00pm.\n\nThe first of three workshops brought together utilities and parties to discuss and address the first question in Track 2 of the High DER Proceeding scoping memo: what are the operational needs necessary to efficiently operate a high DER grid, unlock economic opportunities for DER to provide grid services, limit market power, reduce ratepayer costs, increase equity, support grid resiliency and meet State policy objects?\n\nAgenda\n\nPresentations & Other Resources [California Future Grid Study – Gridworks]\n\nWorkshop recording\n\nWorkshop 2: Assessing Gaps\n\nMarch 12th, 2024 from 11:00am to 5:00pm\n\nIn the next part of the workshop series, the goal was to provide answers to the first half of the second question listed in the scoping memo: What are the existing gaps and barriers in achieving the needs identified [as discussed in Workshop 1] within our current Distribution System Operator (Utilities)?\n\nPre-Workshop [Survey]\n\nAgenda\n\nWorkshop recording\n\nWorkshop 3: Developing Recommendations to Address Gaps\n\nMay 1st, 2024 from 11:00am to 5:00pm\n\nThe last workshop of this series worked with parties involved to find potential solutions to overcome the barriers found during the gap assessment in workshop 2, this final session focused on concreting recommendations for the Commission to address identified gaps.\n\nAgenda\n\nWorkshop Recording\n\nA more thorough description of the workshop series, along with background material, is available on the Gridworks Website Future Grid Study Overview\n\nEducation and Outreach Workshop\n\nThe workshop aimed to educate stakeholders on distribution planning and Distribution System Operator (DSO) topics to facilitate meaningful engagement in the High DER proceeding. Additionally, it presented new and existing community engagement plans for proceeding tracks 1 and 2, along with CPUC's coordination with CEC outreach efforts.\n\nThis workshop was held August 23, 2022 at 9:00 am\n\nAgenda\n\nWorkshop Recording",
