This includes: (1) the âGDPRâ, the European Data Protection Law which stands for âGeneral Data Protection Regulationâ, with the official name Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council; (2) âPIPEDAâ (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), which is the Canadian Data Protection Law that applies to our activities in Canada; and (3) the California Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ) which applies to our activities in the United States. Kevala is committed to adhering to all these applicable Data Protection laws.\n\nâ\n\nâPersonal dataâ â this is information we collect from you or about you and which is defined in the GDPR as âany information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.â It can be as simple as your name or your email, or something more complicated like an online identifier (usually a string of letters and / or numbers) that gets attached to you. Under PIPEDA and the CCPA, the equivalent concept is âpersonal information,â which is roughly the same. Any mention of âpersonal dataâ in this Policy shall also mean personal information.\n\n2.

Boosting morale and providing hardworking care teams with a well-deserved break is essential, as they are vital to every healthcare organization.\n\nâ\n\nWe are incredibly willing to support LCCA in recognizing their staff's incredible work. Healthcare facilities like Life Care Center of Federal Way deserve a lot of credit for organizing such an exciting event for their staff.Â\n\nâ\n\nRyan had this to say about the whole event,Â\n\nâ\n\n\"Life Care Center of Federal Way wanted to say thank you to our partners at Kevala for helping us staff during our company's annual Facility BBQ! We had a total of 150+ people who came together to celebrate the buildingâs accomplishments during the Facility BBQ and it was a breath of fresh air to have everyone disengaged from the building for a short period of time to enjoy each otherâs company.\"\n\nâ\n\nWe at Kevala are happy to help our partners give their hardworking nurses and healthcare staff the recognition they deserve.Â"

      "# Post ID 1buw3jg: Why is the Vedanta Society’s core philosophy Kevala Advaita? with +13 score by [(Ok-Summer2528, Reddit, 2024-04-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvaitaVedanta/comments/1buw3jg/why_is_the_vedanta_societys_core_philosophy/)\nI know the core philosophy of the Society is Kevala Advaita, but I’m kind of wondering why. \n\nVivekanada in many of his lectures talks about how God “becomes” this entire world, he seems to believe that this world is literally the manifestation of Brahman, and that the sense of separation is Maya, not multiplicity itself. \n\nAnd this makes sense when we look at what Ramakrishna himself taught, for example: \n\n“That which is Brahman is verily Sakti. I address That, again, as the Mother. I call It Brahman when It is inactive, and Sakti when It creates, preserves, and destroys” -Ramakrishna\n\nNow it goes without saying no traditional Advaitan would say this because of the belief that Brahman is completely static and unmoving, it has no Shakti according to traditional Advaita. Ramakrishna practiced and mastered much of Tantra so it makes sense he would understand these concepts very well.\n\nWith people like Ramakrishna and Vivekanada being so important and foundational to the Vedanta society it leaves me wondering, why don’t talk about this side of Ramakrishna’s teachings? Why is their core philosophy Kevala Advaita in spite of these clear teachings? \n\n## Comment ID kxvrnrj with +19 score by [(kfpswf, Reddit, 2024-04-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvaitaVedanta/comments/1buw3jg/why_is_the_vedanta_societys_core_philosophy/kxvrnrj/) (in reply to ID 1buw3jg):\nIt is interesting to see that this sub is going through a phase now where it has moved beyond the questions pertaining to Brahman, Maya, ego and the mind, and is now more focused on dry semantics of different schools of thought.\n\nAs someone who became acquainted with Neo-Advaita first, and has mostly remained an ardent follower of Nisargadatta Maharaj, I find these topics of discussions to be just endless discussions of dissecting semantics and opinions. Different conceptual frameworks were provided by gurus as per their interpretation of the truth. Pick any, and just be sincerely devoted to one framework. In the end, it's not a particular conceptual framework that matters, but rather how deep the conviction of Aham Brahmasmi percolates into your mind.\n\nUnless you had a direct experience with the life experiences of Shankaracharya, or Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, you really aren't qualified to say if Brahman is static, or is Shakti is an aspect of Brahman. So pick a qualified Guru, and dedicate your life to their teachings. That's the only way.\n\nWhen wisdom blossoms in you for real, you see the truth in Advaita Vedanta, just as much as you see in Kashmiri Shaivism.\n\n### Comment ID kxvu56t with +4 score by [(Ok-Summer2528, Reddit, 2024-04-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvaitaVedanta/comments/1buw3jg/why_is_the_vedanta_societys_core_philosophy/kxvu56t/) (in reply to ID kxvrnrj):\nI agree generally, but at least some level of semantics in philosophy is necessary to establish a foundation and path. Yes the truth is non-conceptual and intuitive, realization is not in a thought construct.

As long as you aren't chasing downright misleading beliefs like no effort/Sadhana being necessary, and follow a teacher who is well regarded, the actual technicalities of the matter should be left to the scholars or actual gurus.

People will learn Sanskrit terminology by typing it into Google or ChatGPT, I'm serious. **This actually happens. Often.**\n\nThen they come and argue those definitions and self-received teachings amongst the sub. In saying this, this particular post has nothing to do with semantics. These particular topics are covered in the Tattvabodha and other foundational texts to Advaita Vedanta.\n\nTo OP I would suggest stop everything that is happening and prioritise seeking a Guru's instruction on some beginner text, some proper instruction is required.\n\n>So pick a qualified Guru, and dedicate your life to their teachings.

The question OP has raised is very relevant. It might make the very difference between a person living a worldly life or taking up sannyasa. So it is important to encourage such discussions.\n\n>Pick any\n\nLooks like that is what he is trying to do. Pick a world view isn't like deciding a dish at a restaurant.\n\n>how deep the conviction of Aham Brahmasmi percolates into your mind.\n\nOnly neo-advaita works like this. I think you need to explore Advaita more than OP needs to. \n\n>you really aren't qualified to say if Brahman is static, or is Shakti is an aspect of Brahman.\n\nThis is like saying... You aren't Einstein so don't talk physics.\n\n>When wisdom blossoms in you for real\n\nWisdom doesn't just 'blossom' when you are cracking open a cold one with the boys watching sports. It needs sadhana.

So, he didn't need to be too apologetical or specialized in any school of Vedanta. \n\nSimilarly with Ramana or Dakshinamurti - both utilizing immense shakti to teach directly by induction into the field of Shakti presence. Not a mere philosophy. \n\nSchools of thought are just what they are - attempts of humans to conceptualy figure and structurize things out. Most schools are reflections on human developmental capacities and the ways how certain individuals relate to the Ultimate Reality. Sanatana Dharma includes all of these schools.\n\nWe, humans, tend to fluctuate in our momentary capacity and disposition. When in deep bhava of contemplations, we may be very sattvic and see clearly, there's not much standing between us and the Supreme. when in doubt, maya takes over and offers all kinds of biases - therefore, the technology we may be inclined toward to use can be more tantric and devotional, or even lower. All of them are good and beneficial, if utilized in the way they are conceived for and by individuals they are prescribed for. \n\nWhen Ramakrishna was non-sectarian, that means, he's had something for ANYBODY. And he was so well unified with his Motherly aspect \\*which was a sigillum of his entire life efforts, that this absolutely would have inevitably lead to certain specifics of his entire teaching and legacy. His Mother, is the absolute Reality as a shakta would see her. Yet, Adishakti is the essence and innermost heart of Shiva and they are never separate. Never ever. That's how Shaivas embrace Shakti.\n\n## Comment ID kxvgvfe with +7 score by [(Ziracuni, Reddit, 2024-04-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvaitaVedanta/comments/1buw3jg/why_is_the_vedanta_societys_core_philosophy/kxvgvfe/) (in reply to ID 1buw3jg):\nWhile I endorse most of Sarvapriyananda's views and have never found myself disagreeing with him, I really love Pravrajika Divyanandaprana's more universal approach and ability to directly convey the essence of bhakti - she doesn't strike me as purely advaita at all. - I think a lot could be the result of personal preference of S.

There's nothing traditional about answering that which is paradoxical in nature. You dont answer such questions without some discrepency. And there's nothing that says traditional advaita can't lead to different revelations. You can go looking for a cornerstone all you want. What is still the goal? Liberation. Why use this word and not honor it the same in contemplation. It implies essentially what is argued against. As rigid as tempermant can be regarding practice, there is nothing strict about freedom. What is it that knows freedom? Is it the saying brahman is the unmoving reality? Or is it saying brahman the ultimate reality is with quality/sakti? Which one better describes moksha? Can we even make a distinction or is that something liberation denies our minds? Advaita as traditional religion is flexible in these respects because it has no other choice! There is no other choice! Liberation is the goal, and it implies this freedom! The one who is taken back from discrepency is merely reveling over the inescapable prospect that limitation doesn't exist in the mind that is liberated. What is the quality of conversation then? Does any religion confine it? You can make the distinction if you want, i would just like to say this to you as a means to relate to truth.\n\n## Comment ID kxyyavt with +1 score by [(NarenSpidey, Reddit, 2024-04-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvaitaVedanta/comments/1buw3jg/why_is_the_vedanta_societys_core_philosophy/kxyyavt/) (in reply to ID 1buw3jg):\nAlthough it is good to try to understand different Gurus, this over-exploitation of semantics is what is actually antithetical to Advaita. People get easily caught up in these, quarrel amongst themselves, and eventually fail to ascend beyond these. That's why Shankara said Nahi nahi rakshathi dukrinkarane.\n\nThere is only one Advaita. Advaita is Veda hrudaya. Adding qualifiers like Kevala Advaita, Shuddha Advaita, XYZ Advaita defeats the purpose. Everyone has their own perception of what Brahman is. That vikaara is on part of the seeker and not in Brahman. It is important to understand that all paths eventually lead to the same realization. Rather, they should if they are Vedic. \n\nFor eg, Madhusudhana Saraswati saw Advaita from the perspective of Sri Krishna. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa saw it from the perspective of Devi. Sadaasiva Brahmendra saw it from the perspective of Nirguna Brahman whilst also acknowledging certain gunas extolled in the Saastras. \n\n>traditional Advaitan would say this because of the belief that Brahman is completely static and unmoving, it has no Shakti according to traditional Advaita.\n\nThat is not entirely true. Advaita is a state of realization. It is at the level of exalted personalities like Sukha Brahma, Agastya etc. If someone is saying the above without experiencing Brahman, then that person hasn't fully realized Brahman. And nowhere does it say that Brahman has to be inert. Chit and the Chaitanya that thus ensues is a feature of Brahman.\n\n### Comment ID kyt52by with +1 score by [(raaqkel, Reddit, 2024-04-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvaitaVedanta/comments/1buw3jg/why_is_the_vedanta_societys_core_philosophy/kyt52by/) (in reply to ID kxyyavt):\nAlthough it is good to try to believe in one guru as supreme, not opening oneself to other important perspectives is actually antithetical to Vedanta.\n\n\n>That's why Shankara said Nahi nahi rakshathi dukrinkarane.\n\nHere, Shankara is talking about Grammar and not about questions regarding the nature of Prakriti and Maya.

Sure, widen your horizons. But never forget your original path. A Guru is a personal experience for a reason. YouTube gurus aren't technically Gurus in the truest sense, although they may exhibit great understanding and explain very well. Follow them, but it is your own Guru/Acharya that counts.\n\n>  \nThis is the kind of misinterpretation that comes from sticking blindly to one guru\n\nLol. Shankara said so because the person he was addressing this to was a vyaakarana pandita. The concept can be applied to any situation that you are lamenting about. I am not referring to the exact literary meaning of dukrinkarane here. By your logic, Bhaja Govindam should only apply to grammarians? You should understand the concept and context before jumping to conclusions.\n\nThere is no problem with Shankara or Ramakrishna. The problem is with the tendency of some in this sub to needllessly pit one against another and deriding each of them without understanding the basis of both. \n\nI said \"has to be inert\". Inert and unchanging are different. Inert means not performing any action. Brahman can be both inert and dynamic, just like it can be saguna or nirguna. If it is saguna, it can't be inert. The only thing is that no matter which state It is in, it doesn't get affected by the malefices of that state.\n\n## Comment ID kxw8l6s with +1 score by [(david-1-1, Reddit, 2024-04-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvaitaVedanta/comments/1buw3jg/why_is_the_vedanta_societys_core_philosophy/kxw8l6s/) (in reply to ID 1buw3jg):\nTheir core philosophy is Advaita Vedanta.

This post will address the nature of savikalpa samadhi, kevala nirvikalpa samadhi, sahaja nirvikalpa samadhi and mahasamadhi. It will also explain which of these helps in producing the two different types of muktis, i.e. Kramamukti (liberation without form) and Jivanmukti (liberation with form). \n\n**Disclaimer:** Any attempt to explain Brahman to the satisfaction of a mind that is driven by reason and familiar with the concretization of thought is full of enormous difficulties, because that which is inexplicable cannot be explained by any amount of reasoning and logic. The difficulty in understanding and knowing Brahman logically is well explained in the Kena Upanishad: “Even gods are not free from their ignorance of Brahman.” The Vedic seers themselves had this problem in their mind when they called Brahman vaguely as \"It\", \"This\" or \"That.\" So please bear this in mind as you read through this post and try not to take every word I say literally. I have tried my best to explain the experience of Brahman as precisely as I possibly can but words will never do justice to describe something which transcends descriptions. One must therefore experience this truth directly to fully grasp the highest knowledge. \n\n**Mandukya Karika 3.37:**\n\n>“The Self (Atman) is beyond all expression by words beyond all acts of mind; It is absolutely peaceful, it is eternal effulgence free from activity and fear and it is attainable by samadhi.”\n\nThe Vedas describe Brahman as pure consciousness which is beyond the reach of words and their meanings. Words cannot explain it nor can human thought grasp its nature. It cannot be seen with the eyes or heard with the ears.  It is beyond the senses and beyond any means of comprehension. \n\nIf this is the case, how is it possible for one to know Brahman? There are several sources of  knowledge the human mind can access, mainly that of perception and inference. However, on the spiritual plane, with reference to knowledge of Brahman, perception has to transcend the senses to gain divine wisdom. The enlightened sages have all said this divine wisdom is one of peace, eternal effulgence and absence of activity, and it is possible to experience this when the mind is pure and tranquil. \n\nBut if Brahman is beyond the mind, how can it be experienced?  Do we experience Brahman **with** the mind or do we experience Brahman **without** the mind? Furthermore, what does it mean to experience Brahman? In order to fully understand this, we must first dive into the nature of Brahman and its two aspects. \n\n**The two aspects are:** \n\n1. Saguna Brahman (with qualities)\n2. Nirguna Brahman (without qualities)\n\nWhen we speak of Brahman, we usually refer to Nirguna Brahman which is devoid of any qualities. The Saguna aspect however, is the entire phenomenal universe subject to the categories of space, time, and causation. Though the Nirguna aspect transcends the Saguna aspect, this doesn’t mean Nirguna Brahman is **separate** from Saguna Brahman or beyond it. Saguna Brahman is just a word we use to describe Nirguna Brahman when it **appears** to be dual. There is **only** Nirguna Brahman.  Either it is perceived as Nirguna or it is perceived as Saguna. The difference lies only in its perception. Whatever the perception may be, it doesn’t in any way alter the truth of there being **only** Nirguna. \n\nThe mind or avidya is what brings about this deception. It is the mind that projects the imaginary universe which comprises of thoughts that fuels the false imagination. The mind is not something separate from the self. It is a superimposition (adhyasa) which we **only use as a concept** to explain the reason behind the perception of saguna. With the use of the mind, Nirguna is disguised as Saguna. Without the use of the mind, there is no trickery in play. Therefore, Nirguna Brahman is devoid of objective knowledge that allows anything to be comprehended or known as something seemingly separate from itself. Since objective knowledge (i.e. relative knowledge) can only be grasped with the mind, this makes Nirguna unthinkable, incomprehensible, unknowable and unimaginable.\n\nNirguna Brahman is also synonymous to nirvikalpa samadhi. According to *Tripura Rahasya*, an ancient Advaita text, nirvikalpa samadhi is one’s natural state and is the under-current in all three states of consciousness (waking, dreaming, deep sleep). This is the continuous experience of every being. It is only seemingly interrupted by thoughts and objects and since one’s mind is always extroverted, one remains ignorant of this fact.  \n\nNirvikalpa is **chit** (consciousness). It is effortless, formless and the true nature of the self. To some people whose minds have become purified from long practice in the past, nirvikalpa samadhi can come suddenly as a flood (e.g. kevala nirvikalpa samadhi for the yogis where the self is shining in its full glory void of all objects, thoughts and objective phenomena). For others, it can come in the course of their sadhana or spiritual practice which slowly wears down the obstructing thoughts and reveals the screen of pure awareness while performing their daily actions (e.g. samadhi for the jnanis where the self is shining even in the presence of empirical phenomena). Ramana used to refer to this screen as Aham Sphurana or I’-‘I. This is a term that is often used in the spiritual texts of Tripura Rahasya. I’-‘I denotes the unbroken experience of the self without any disturbances from thoughts. The experience keeps going with a continuous “I” without being broken into: “I am a Jiva”. In other words, you are stuck in the identity as the pure witness principle instead of being identified with the body-mind. It is only the disturbance of thoughts (and attending to them) that makes the mind extroverted again, thereby breaking the pure “I” and reasserting duality. This continuous I’-‘I can **only** come with a *predominantly* sattvic mind and can **only remain unbroken without effort** in the *pure* sattvic state. \n\nThis means that **full and permanent** realization **while living with form** is only attained by abiding in the sattvic state without the possibility of attending to objective knowledge that is projected by Rajas and succumbing to delusion due to the concealment of Tamas. In the pure sattvic or transparent mind, the mind ceases to exist therefore, one cannot say that abidance in this state is abidance in the mind; rather, it is abidance in the self where the mind is absent. \n\nThis means nirvikalpa samadhi (whether temporary or permanently) can be experienced, but **not** as the mind; rather, it is experienced *as* the self. The pure self is what you’re always experiencing because this is the real you **and** the **only** you. Brahman is the subjective experience of the feeling “I”. It is the most brightly shining of all things, but so long as its shining is mixed with any other thing (thoughts), it is not shining sufficiently clearly. In order to shine with **complete clarity**, “I” must shine alone, that is, it must be experienced on its own, in the absence of all other things. When it starts to shine alone in complete isolation of other things, the “I” becomes more **intensely** clear. This clarity **becomes** evident in samadhi. \n\n**Tripura Rahasya 80:**\n\n>“Absolute Reality is **manifest** in Samadhi…”\n\nSo if one can experience the pure self as the pure self or remain as the continuous “I”,  then how can the mind remember that experience if it wasn’t present or active during such a moment? This is a common question asked by many seekers who have never experienced samadhi and who tend to use logic and reasoning to explain why experiencing Brahman is not possible. The confusion lies in the word ‘experience’. Either you experience with the mind, in which case you can think and say that you are having an experience **or** you can experience your true self **as** the true self (without the mind), in which case you **cannot** think or say anything about the experience because there is no mind present to think or say anything. \n\n**Kena Upanishad 11:**\n\n>“It is Known to him to whom it is Unknown; he knows it not to whom it is known. (It is) Unknown to those who know, and Known to those who do not know.”\n\nTry saying that verse 3X fast! This means that the true knower of Brahman has firm conviction that Brahman is *unknowable* during the moment Brahman is realized. But if one thinks they *know* Brahman in that very moment, he is not realized and still fooled by the mind since it’s only possible to know something with the mind.\n\nThe experience of Brahman **as itself**, i.e. nirvikalpa samadhi is **only** understood when the mind becomes present again **after** the continuous self-experience. So how is this possible? Well, you are always experiencing the self because there is **only** the self. Your existence and awareness right now proves that you are having a self-experience (*even when it’s perceived as Saguna*) **\\[Remember\\]**: there is only **one** truth regardless of how it’s perceived. So when you abide as the pure self (void of thoughts) and **then** cling back to the mind (full of thoughts) you can now remember what happened. This doesn’t mean what happened was something that happened within space and time. It means your attention turned away from everything including the constructs of space and time and had a self-experience, i.e. abidance in your natural state. In this moment, your true self was shining with complete clarity void of all constructs. When the mind becomes active again, that clarity diminishes because the constructs are now present obscuring the true clarity from being realized. But you can now leverage the mind and its constructs to understand just how complete that true clarity was. So how can you not know just how strong the profound presence was when the mind then reasserts itself to look back on that utterly still moment? It can now compare both experiences and clearly acknowledge realization.\n\n**Tripura Rahasya 56:**\n\n>“When the mind has completely resolved into the Self, that state is called Nirvikalpa Samadhi (the undifferentiated peaceful state). After waking up from it, the person is overpowered by the memory of his experience as the one, undivided, infinite, pure Self and he knows 'I am That'…”\n\nThis remembrance however is much different than recalling the experience of deep sleep or the experience of absence without the shining “I”. In deep sleep, one merges into the Self **but without** awareness of the “I” due to the pervasion of tama guna which conceals this truth from being known clearly. In samadhi however, one attains the self with **full** awareness and complete clarity of the “I”. The experience of Nirvikalpa samadhi is like being fully locked in and frozen as the “I” **but** with absolutely nothing to “know” due to the absence of objective knowledge. It is an **incessant** experience of the “I”.  When objective knowledge arises, the “I” can now cling to something that can now be known and grasped. The switch from no-mind to mind is a switch from being **fully** aware to being **aware** BUT with something to know. Therefore, you can see just how the experience **as the self** can be known when the mind is used again, given you are **always aware** throughout the entire process from beginning to end. \n\n**Tripura Rahasya 82:**\n\n>“Samadhi and sleep are obvious because their experience remains unbroken for some appreciable period and can be recapitulated after waking up.”\n\nWaking up from the samadhi **doesn’t** mean you were previously unconscious and now you become conscious upon waking up. It simply means you were **fully** conscious in samadhi as Brahman, and upon waking up, you are now conscious as Brahman **but** through the connection of the body-mind uphadi. When the gross body is active, this is known as the ‘waking state’.  Waking up simply means the gross body is active again. It doesn’t imply that you were previously unaware as Brahman and now you are aware as the body-mind. In samadhi, you were already fully aware as the self. Why? Because the self itself is pure awareness! This however is not the case with deep sleep. In deep sleep, the self is not shining completely so it cannot be realized during that state. \n\n**Tripura Rahasya 90-93:**\n\n>“The unmanifest state, the first-born of abstract Intelligence revealing 'There is not anything' - is the state of abstraction full of light; it is, however, called sleep because it is the insentient phase of consciousness. Nothing is revealed because there is nothing to be revealed. Sleep is therefore the manifestation of the insentient state. But in Samadhi, Brahman, the Supreme Consciousness, is continuously glowing.“\n\nSo now that we understand the difference between samadhi and deep sleep and how nirvikalpa samadhi is not an experience of the mind but rather an experience **as the self**, i.e. Nirguna Brahman; is there a way of knowing the self **simultaneously** *with* the use of the mind? i.e. the other aspect of Brahman (Saguna). Also, how can one progress to a point where the screen of awareness becomes permanently exposed and **not just temporarily,** *without* any potentiality of identifying with the body and mind ever again?\n\n[\\\\\"The Atman that is absolute existence and knowledge cannot be realized without constant practice. So one seeking after knowledge should long meditate upon Brahman for the attainment of the desired goal.\\\\\" - Adi Shankara](https://preview.redd.it/ju9l60z5dena1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5b4f6f1c63e79d7b56ed45c90cd2c812b15fd44)\n\nIn order to achieve full, complete and total liberation **while living with form** in the physical realm, **subjective meditation is necessary.** Subjective meditation is known as *nididhyasana*. Nididhyasana or *atma-vichara* is usually followed by *sravana* and *manana* in the traditional advaita system, although this doesn’t necessarily mean these steps should be followed linearly within a single lifetime since a particular step may bear fruit in future lives. Shankara points out the three phases which leads one to samadhi thereby producing liberation.  \n\n**Shankara Bhyasha Brahma Sutras 1.1.2**\n\n>“This kind of reasoning includes the (1) hearing of the texts (Sravana), (2) thinking about their meaning (Manana), and (3) meditation on them (Nididhyasana). This leads to **intuition**.”\n\nIntuition here is just another word for samadhi. \n\nThis is clarified in **2.3.33:**\n\n>“Hearing, reasoning, and meditation lead to **Samadhi**, in which state perfect **Knowledge dawns**.”\n\nIntuition is equivalent to samadhi. It is also known as *atma-jnanam* if the result of it was aided with the use of theoretical knowledge.  The higher knowledge of the self is realized through samadhi. This is because samadhi is none other than the self since it is a **self-experience**. The true nature of the self is jnana or absolute knowledge. \n\n**Shankara’s commentary on Gaudapada’s Mandukya Karika 3.37:**\n\n>“The Ātman is denoted by the word *Samādhi* as it can be realised only by the *knowledge* *arising* out of the *deepest concentration* (*on its essence*) or, the Ātman is denoted by Samādhi because the Jīva concentrates his mind on Ātman.”\n\nWhen we practice atma-vicara or what Shankara refers to as meditation, i.e. nididhyasana, the aim is to turn one’s attention away from objective phenomena and turn towards the self by negating all that is non-self until one ‘**intuits**’ the self directly. While many on the Advaita path believe that there is no special experience they should be seeking, *this is a wrong presumption*. **What we are seeking to experience** is a greater clarity of self-awareness **until** such clarity **becomes** absolute (*at which point there is longer the ability to call anything an experience*). The only way to experience such clarity is by having an **unbroken** experience of the self throughout any daily action. This continuous experience of the self (or the “I”) is what Shankara refers to as the Brahmakara Vritti. This is not an actual vritti or thought but only a term we use to describe the functioning of the mind when it turns into “no-mind\". This is none other than samadhi and must be practiced persistently until the functioning becomes natural. Before this final goal is reached, the mind **will actively be in use while trying to keep samadhi in motion**. One will therefore become exposed to this higher truth **while** operating in the relative plane. This is known as **savikalpa samadhi**.\n\n**Shankara's Vedānta Sāra 820/831/832:**\n\n>“In the relative plane of consciousness, one is aware of Brahman as permeating the whole of one’s field of consciousness. Inasmuch as one has yet to establish complete identity with that which one contemplates, it is called ‘relative’. Savikalpa samādhi is that which is blended with the objects of knowledge. There is at the same time a realization of the Ātman as the unchanging witness...\"\n\nThis means the Jiva will not turn into Brahman all at once or become Brahman just by intellectually knowing it (this is still ignorance). It will first know it’s true state when receiving intermittent flashes of the self during savikalpa samadhi. Though this true state will not come with complete clarity since the false identity has yet to be completely given up or be fully merged with the real one *as* the pure self. This means savikalpa samadhi is still within the saguna aspect of Brahman. In order to transition this samadhi to sahaj nirvikalpa samadhi thereby rendering the screen of awareness permanently exposed, one must practice meditation (samadhi) persistently until there is no longer the potentiality of being entangled with the body-mind ever again. You must hold the “I” continuously until it becomes fully locked in and where effort in remaining there is no longer required. This is how one achieves the status of jivanmukti (vedanta’s version of enlightenment). \n\n**Shankara's Vedānta Sāra 817/834:**\n\n>“One who desires to attain liberation should therefore practice meditation unceasingly, until all the wrong ideas that arise in the mind as to the nature of the Ātman are completely eradicated. It is in this way that one comes to identify oneself with the witnessing consciousness...\"\n\nTherefore, before nirvikalpa samadhi can be permanently established, the jiva must become a knower of Brahman through savikalpa samadhi where effort is made at turning attention away from the false identity. If this is done long enough, the mind (uphadis) will dissolve and witness principle (saksi) will have nothing left to attend to other than itself (it’s own nirguna formless form). Without samadhi, one will remain glued to the body-mind uphadis and hence **will not be free** from the cycle of rebirth. \n\n**Shankara's Vivekachudamani 357:**\n\n>“Through the diversity of the supervening conditions (upadhis), a man is apt to think of himself as also full of diversity; but with the removal of these he is again his own Self, the *immutable*. Therefore the wise man should ever devote himself to the practice of Samadhi, for the dissolution of the Upadhis.”\n\nShankara has been very clear on the essentiality of samadhi and why it’s absolutely necessary for moksha. This is referenced in many of his complete works including bhashyas on the Brahma Sutras and Upanishads, Aparokshabhuti, Vivekachudamani, Upadesasahasri, and many more. While many who have been following recent Advaita acharyas have said that the real traditional view of Advaita is a *non-mystic* approach, this **doesn’t** imply that samadhi is not required for moksha. It simply means the traditional approach does not rely on yogic samadhi (the “*mystical*” way) as a means to moksha. This would be considered a dualistic approach that contradicts their non-dual system. This dualistic approach is based on a methodology that has its foundation built on the belief that prakriti (matter) and purusha (consciousness) are separate. Therefore, the crux lies in the type of mediation that is practiced by both aspirants.  Followers on Patanjali’s path practice objective mediation (dhyana) while those on Shankara’s path practice subjective mediation (nididhyasana). Dhyana signifies meditation on an object whereas nididhyasana signifies inquiry into the self. The former requires an object to meditate on while the latter only requires the subject. \n\nSince many followers on the path of Jnana Yoga do not practice yogic samadhi, many have now been led to believe that samadhi in general is not required at all! So they remain stuck with lower knowledge purely at the conceptual level and will have no choice but to revisit this knowledge in future lives until they realize samadhi is required to get them out of it! They will also be surprised to find out that samadhi will be a natural occurrence if they practice nididhyasana (last phase of Jnana Yoga) **correctly**. Samadhi will be a natural outcome for those following **both** paths. **Both approaches will lead to Jnana** (i.e. *turning the mind into no-mind*). This full and irreversible transformation itself is liberation.  ***Note***: The term Jnana should not be confused with the **path** of Jnana Yoga. The path of Jnana Yoga is simply using theoretical knowledge of the self as the foundation for subjective mediation in order to produce liberation **while living** (something that **cannot** be done via Patanjali’s approach which is a dual system that can only produce liberation upon death of the physical body). \n\nWhile one can intellectually know brahman through the srutis, this is still considered lower knowledge because it is fully leveraging the body-mind. The mind in this case continues to be externalized. So long as the mind is externalized, the nature of Brahman cannot be known. Intellectual knowledge therefore **cannot** produce liberation on its own although it is a step in the right direction. It is necessary to intellectually understand the nature of Brahman and Atman being identical (as stated in the mahavakyas) before self-inquiry can be done successfully to produce liberation in the physical realm without the dependency of the physical body dying. Transcendence of body-mind can only come with the higher knowledge derived from savikalpa samadhi which serves as a pathway to connect the attention of awareness entangled with the false self to that of the innermost self, i.e. nirguna. Without samadhi, one will remain entangled with the body-mind no matter how many times they recite verses from the scriptures. S*o forgive me Iswara as I still have a few more verses to recite.*\n\n**Adhyatama Upanishad 1.17:**\n\n>“The knot of the ignorance (mind) in the heart (self) is broken completely only when one sees his Self as secondless through Nirvikalpa Samadhi.”\n\nSo can Brahman be experienced? Yes, it absolutely can. Either you experience it *fully* **as the self** through nirvikalpa samadhi or you experience it *partially* with the mind through savikalpa samadhi. However, no matter what the experience is, you’re always experiencing Brahman. **Why?** Because there is only Brahman! There is never a time you are **not** experiencing Brahman. It is so obvious, you just don’t notice it in its complete purity due to the distractions from thoughts and the annoying superimpositions of the uphadis that tricks you and prevents this self-luminous truth from being fully realized. Though it must be noted that when the clarity of “I” grows and becomes **absolute**, by itself, it cannot be known and therefore we cannot even call it a normal experience because it is unknowable as itself. Yet you remain as **that** in a pure and unknowable self-experience. \n\nThe higher knowledge of Brahman becomes more clear to the jiva when the ego submits more and more. This is why the truth of Brahman is known more clearly in the higher realms where the sages reside, simply because these realms are much subtler and causal in nature due to there being very little ego present. This allows the truth of Brahman to shine more clearly as you slowly transition your identity from Jiva to Brahman as you move up the realms. It is worthy to note that moksha can also be redeemed in the highest and most subtle realm Brahmaloka (where the unaltered truth of Brahman resides). This is where the jiva can either **deeply and subtlety** gravitate towards Nirguna on its own terms via inner travel through yogic samadhi upon death of the physical body **or** be released in Nirguna automatically after residing there until the end of the kalpa. As the lokas withdraw in during cosmic dissolution, the jiva will naturally relinquish all causal and subtle desires along with any notion of doership upon being absorbed in the pure absolute knowledge of Brahman (*this is only if they decide to not revert back to the astral realms)*. This is known as kramamukti or liberation in steps. This is important to note because it signifies that knowledge of Brahman becomes more evident and clear as one’s ego becomes smaller. In Brahmaloka, there is only a very small trace of ego left which then gets completely vanished when submerged in the absolute. \n\nThis is difficult to comprehend for those who have not experienced deep states of savikalpa samadhi through self-inquiry or deep transcendental states of Brahmaloka via yogic samadhi. The physical realm is very dense and solidified, so the truth of Brahman is more obscured in this realm, i.e. it is an altered truth. Therefore, the average human mind is unable to access such truths since they are strongly identified with the false self. The Rishis and Sages (many of whom reside in higher realms and thus have direct access to this knowledge) incarnate to the lower realms to expound these higher truths to help elevate mankind. Without this knowledge, humans wouldn’t have access to this wisdom unless they themselves are spiritually qualified to receive this knowledge directly. This higher knowledge can only bloom experientially once the ego submits and when the mind begins to lose its own identity (something that cannot happen unless one first knows that it is even possible to happen). Therefore, theoretical knowledge is needed for jivas in this physical realm as a means to become exposed to higher truths. This higher truth will **gradually** become more known to you **directly** as you put this theoretical knowledge into practical use. \n\nThis means knowing Brahman is not always a flip of a switch from mind to no-mind. This will mostly result in manolaya or temporary kevala nirvikalpa samadhi which comes as a sudden rush bypassing the clear understanding of the true self. This experience at best will serve as validation of there being a self which the jiva can now use as higher knowledge to re-identify themselves with the supreme identity and thus destroy the very root of ignorance. **Full realization** however will come as a gradual unfoldment of the **mind becoming no-mind** due to the vasanas that are destroyed in this very transformative process. This is something that only happens upon full liberation. It will **not** come by the mind **switching** to no-mind **abruptly** due to the **halting** of vasanas (Kevala Nirvikalpa samadhi). If you experience the self temporarily, it is called *practice*. If it is everlasting and permanent, it is the *supreme experience*. \n\nThe shift of mind **becoming** no mind **through self-inquiry** results in the gradual transition from savikalpa samadhi to sahaj nirvikalpa samadhi bypassing the need for kevala nirvikalpa samadhi. This steady unitary awareness when the mind becomes no-mind does not get disturbed even when objects are perceived, whereas kevala nirvikalpa samadhi is continued only in the absence of the objects. \n\n***Note:*** The jnani’s way to liberation differs from the yogi’s way to liberation through mahasamadhi. Mahasamadhi is when the yogi **consciously exits the body through yogic samadhi** and attains liberation. The yogi becomes liberated through the totality of bliss in Brahmaloka and then gets submerged in the absolute knowledge of Brahman where the mind turns into no-mind. Liberation in this case will **only** be produced if prarabdha is deemed to fully extinguish in the highest heaven. This means most of the karma would have already been burned by savikalpa samadhi during the waking state prior to physical death (*if not the jiva will be drawn to come back as it takes a long time for karma to be exhausted in the higher realms)*. Depending on the prarabdha karma, the yogi will either be led to immortality sooner upon death or much later. The jiva will know intuitively if mahasamadhi is the course of action they should take and will be called upon to undertake the ultimate sacrifice when ready. With sahaj nirvikalpa samadhi however, the jnani is liberated **while living** (jivanmukti). This is *rupini* or liberation *with form*. In this case, the jnani turns the mind into Brahman by keeping savikalpa stable **throughout any daily action**. This can only be done using the non-dual methodology (nididhyasana). By doing so, the jnani fully locks in the pure aham or sattvic state and achieves immediate liberation via status of Turiya. This means the jnani gets to witness the physical body perform actions **without effort, volition and thought**. Under Iswara's hands, this status later becomes *Turiyatita* upon disembodiment of the body.  For the jnani, there is no need to kill the body and go to Brahmaloka since liberation can be produced right here in this very world itself. This is why Patanjali’s system cannot produce this type of mukti since it is a dual-approach that aims in “achieving” Brahman as something separate.\n\nThese are the differences between samadhi for the yogis and samadhi for the jnanis. **Though, the difference doesn’t lie in the actual experience of samadhi** but rather the method of fructifying it and the approach of using it to produce liberation. \n\n***Note***: There is no one mukti that is superior to the other. We will all be liberated one way or the other according to Iswara’s will. Mukti however cannot happen without samadhi since the very nature of moksha is permanent samadhi! Saying samadhi is not required for moksha is equivalent to saying money is not required to be financially rich.  It is also important to note that knowledge of liberation and how close you are will come intuitively through savikalpa samadhi. You cannot attain liberation if you’re unconscious of how close you are or when it will happen. It is **not** something you will be surprised with after death. The person who is qualified for libration will know, solely because of the revelations they receive during deep samadhi which confirms their status of mukti. Sages who have already worked out their karma receive divine visions which come as intuitive understandings of when it’s time to leave. This is how you know you are close and exactly why **moksha cannot be redeemed without samadhi**. \n\n**\\[Brief Summary of my Experience\\]** Roughly three years ago my status of mukti was confirmed with an initiation to Brahmaloka (something I have not communicated with a group until now; which I’ve only decided to share since this will be my last post). This knowledge came intuitively through the use of kundalini energy focused intensely in the ajna chakra during deep savikalpa samadhi and also many times during the interim period of savikalpa after coming down from nirvikalpa samadhi. Kundalini meditation is something I’ve been practicing for over a decade now while using the energy itself to guide me internally. With the use of kundalini energy, I have been able to receive an abundance of spiritual knowledge ranging from all different subject matter that I was able to verify using the scriptures. This shows the energy's enormous power of unravelling deep hidden information engraved within the very blueprints of reality. Sages from the higher realms and divine intelligence have communicated telepathically that it is my full birth right to reap the spiritual reward of liberation if I choose to. This is a reward that I have been granted with for many past lives as well but chose to delay the process. Reaping the reward of liberation would require me to go into mahasamadhi and give everything up completely. For now, it is a mission of mine to explain both the yogic path and the jnani's path. With self-inquiry, I have been able to cultivate savikalpa samadhi intermittently throughout the day and during sleep **without** the use of kundalini energy. Intuitive visions and extreme feelings of bliss comes with **both** approaches. As you maintain samadhi more, the more absolute the experience becomes until all feelings of bliss are given up. I now understand just how profound both approaches are for liberation and just how special it is to use both as a means to burn karma. Again, there is no one way that is superior to the other. There is only the approach you will be called upon to undertake as the time approaches to say your final goodbye. \n\nThe point of my story is that higher knowledge (no matter which way you cultivate it) will only arise when the mind becomes pure thereby rendering the ego useless. If the ego is useless, Brahman or self-experience will take over. This very process itself is samadhi. Brahman is disguised **as** the mind, so it’s here right now as we speak even though it doesn’t seem to be this way. This truth or knowledge will become more evident to you **as** a Jiva when the ego submits more with little traces of “i-ness” left to clearly experience this already self-shining truth. **This is because Brahman becomes more manifest as ignorance is removed**.\n\n**Shankara Bhyasha Brahma Sutras 1.1.4:**\n\n>“When ignorance is removed Brahman manifests Itself, even as when the illusion of the snake is removed the rope manifests itself.”\n\nIgnorance in this case, **is not** relative ignorance which can only be resolved through the use of relative knowledge (e.g. becoming qualified as a mechanic will help resolve my ignorance about how to repair cars). Ignorance per Shankara’s commentary is different.  It is none other than the mind itself (avidya) which can only be fully resolved by higher knowledge (samadhi) which aims at turning the mind into Brahman thereby removing ignorance (or the mind!). \n\nThe ego is also synonymous to the mind, even though in Vedanta, the ahamkara (ego) is explained as one of the several different functions of it. However these functions are only meant for analytical exposition and not for the actual inquiry. In other words, once the doer goes, all other functions goes with it. Therefore, when we say ignorance is being removed, this simply means the owner of actions (ego) is becoming smaller. It will no longer feel as if you are operating the body-mind but rather witnessing the operation of the body-mind. **This is samadhi.** Either you operate as the ego or you operate as Brahman. **But** the gradual transition from one to the other will give you a taste of **both** as one becomes smaller (*less identifiable*) **while** the other becomes larger (*more identifiable*). In other words, as one goes down in identity, the other goes up in proportion depending on which way attention drifts. If the ego gets smaller, this is the mind **becoming** no-mind (i.e. the process of savikalpa samadhi). **\\[Remember\\]** there are two aspects of **one** truth. As you remove ignorance, the saguna aspect **turns into** the nirguna aspect. You don’t jump from one to the other as if they are separate. This will only result in laya which you will need to come back from. You will always be introduced with savikalpa samadhi before nirvikalpa or absolute reality is **fully** manifested.\n\nIt’s very difficult to explain or even understand the experience of Brahman, which is why you must experience samadhi yourself to fully grasp this higher knowledge. Otherwise, one tends to resort to logic and reasoning which only pollutes the understanding of Brahman and the nature of experience. Furthermore, entertaining concepts and thinking in general will only obstruct higher knowledge from manifesting because any activity of the mind, e.g. an active intellect or any action with doership involved, prevents the knowledge of Brahman from arising. \n\n**Kaivalya Upanishad 2:**\n\n>“By knowing It (Brahman) alone, one attains Immortality —there is no other way to its attainment. Neither by work, nor by offspring, nor by wealth, does one attain Immortality, but by renunciation alone.”\n\nThe word **work** or karma in this case denotes the sacrifices (ritualistic and philanthropic actions) described in the Vedas which assumes actions done with doership. An action is dependent upon the doer (the instrument of action) and the result. Because it is associated with these two factors, karma or action is utterly distracting from the knowledge of non-dual Brahman. If you are always entangled with the body-mind in your actions, how can you expect the Atman to be realized if you’re stuck in the false identity? \n\n**Shankara Bhyasha Brahma Sutras 1.1.4:**\n\n>“As brahman is your inner Self, you cannot attain it by any action. It is realized as one’s own Atman when the ignorance is annihilated.”\n\nActions are acts done with doership. Inactions are actions done **without** doership. Actions therefore will not manifest higher knowledge of the self simply because you are entangled with the instrument of action. But if doership is renounced, it allows the Atman to be realized since there is nothing left to identify with. Actions can be done for purification of the mind. You can leverage doership or the sense of “I am” in your spiritual practice as a means for purification. Renunciation however is for revealing truth. Once the mind is purified enough, you should renounce doership completely through meditation in order for truth to be revealed as it cannot come if you’re completely invested in the activities of the wrong identity. \n\nOne who uses the body-mind for purification is performing sadhanas. However, one who has renounced the body-mind becomes the knower of Brahman. What then is use of sadhanas for such an individual? Knowledge itself cannot be said to be an activity of the mind. Therefore, the mind needs to be renounced for higher knowledge to manifest. The renunciation of the body-mind manifests samadhi. The wise, by means of knowledge alone through samadhi realize the eternal and self-luminous Brahman; there is no other path to its realization and **most certainly no other path to liberation**.\n\n**Shankara’s Vivekachudamani 375:**\n\n>“The extremely dispassionate man alone has Samadhi, and the man of Samadhi alone gets steady realization; the man who has realised the Truth is alone free from bondage, and the free soul only experiences eternal Bliss.”\n\nOnly when we purify our minds by continuing our spiritual practices and developing our level of concentration will we be able to renounce completely and manifest the higher knowledge of Brahman. When samadhi comes, you will truly know the real truth that has been hidden from you all along simply waiting to be uncovered. \n\n## Comment ID jc2sdm0 with +9 score by [(samjain2907, Reddit, 2023-03-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvaitaVedanta/comments/11qds9j/the_experience_of_brahman_explained_the_nature_of/jc2sdm0/) (in reply to ID 11qds9j):\nThank you so much.

Is it true that full liberation happens only when one comes out of Samadhi? As you mentioned both the yogic and jnani's experience of samadhi are identical but their paths to liberation differ, is it because the yogi is lacking the intellectual knowledge of Brahman or is it because of the nature of their practice itself? When the mind slowly arises out of the oneness experienced in (kevala) nirvikalpa samadhi, does the atma-jnanam occur spontaneously and is it guaranteed? (does it depend on the nature of the mind or any other point?)\n\nFinal question: would you recommend people here to practice other meditation practices(like kundalini) in addition to self-enquiry? What are some good resources to learn about the real kundalini practice?\n\n### Comment ID jc7hlb4 with +3 score by [(Silver_Artichoke_531, Reddit, 2023-03-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvaitaVedanta/comments/11qds9j/the_experience_of_brahman_explained_the_nature_of/jc7hlb4/) (in reply to ID jc35hyp):\nFull liberation can only happen when the mind fully turns into Brahman. This means samadhi must remain permanent. Coming out of samadhi implies one is re-identified again with the uphadis so there can be no moksha unless one renters samadhi and keeps it steady and in motion until the uphadis dissolve completely. \n\nThe yogi may not lack intellectual knowledge but their method/practice is flawed to produce liberation while occupying the body. Their practice assumes this: “I am not this, I am that”  This is a dualistic approach or a means to achieve something that they don’t already see in the present. This is why they cannot achieve liberation directly **while living** and can only produce it upon death of the body. The only way to produce liberation while living is by making Brahman the only subject. It cannot happen by assuming you are a Jiva trying to achieve Brahman as if the two are separate. This is the major flaw with the method the yogis practice. Again, this doesn’t mean liberation cannot be produced by this method, but it cannot be produced while occupying the body. \n\nThe practice of atma-vichara differs as the jnani sees Brahman without having to perform a one-off action. They see Brahman right here, right now by turning away from all objective phenomena. There is no concentration on a particular thought or object or the need to close the eyes or to sit down and do pranayama. Everything non-self is negated in their inquiry. It’s a very subtle process (not an intellectual one). It is a process of self-surrender while acting without doership so there is no use of the intellect. This type of practice produces direct liberation without the need to exit the body. See the crucial difference between them both? \n\nThe yogi might know that Brahman is non-dual but the practice does not truly align with that understanding. Therefore it needs to be altered if one wants to experience samadhi effortlessly through objective phenomena without the need of kundalini, breath control, etc. \n\nFor one who has experienced kevala nirvikalpa samadhi, liberation is sure to be produced if they choose to take it there. Atma-jnanam is only guaranteed when the mind turns into Brahman. Either it’s produced here through the status of jivanmukti or it’s produced through Brahmaloka. Any other temporary samadhis is not full knowledge. If it was, liberation would have been produced right there and then. This doesn’t imply one didn’t rest in the self but simply because they bypassed the light of turiya that allows them to rest there permanently. \n\nWrt. Kundalini, there are many people who practice this meditation but without the energy fully awakened. This can help to some degree depending on what your goal/objectives are. If the energy is fully awakened however, it can be too intense for one who doesn’t know what they are doing which is why a teacher is strongly recommended. It’s certainly not for the faint of heart and can be terrifying or traumatic for those who are not qualified to move the energy. Some people can’t handle the siddhis that come with it, nor are some able to handle when the screen of duality starts to crumble. Unfortunately I am not too familiar with any resources around kundalini as I am self-taught and used the inner intelligence to guide me. I plan on including it in my website but will take some time to explain it in detail. If the energy is not awakened, you should continue your self-inquiry practice or any other practice that have helped with your spiritual progress.  I don’t recommend anyone trying to awaken the kundalini. When it’s the right time, the energy will awaken you and you will have no choice but to face it head-on.\n\n#### Comment ID jd5rk7g with +2 score by [(Ornery-Ocelot, Reddit, 2023-03-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvaitaVedanta/comments/11qds9j/the_experience_of_brahman_explained_the_nature_of/jd5rk7g/) (in reply to ID jc7hlb4):\nThank you for this beautiful post which is full of deep insights.

I did manage to get to the end of it eventually. I think you should have led with your own personal experience and expounded upon that. Nevertheless, the philosophical framework is useful. I did know that there were two types of Nirvikalpa Samadhis, I just wasn't aware they had separate names. Good to know. \n\nI'm not sure I agree about the Brahman with attributes vs without attributes concept, seems like this is a creation of the mind that tries to understand Brahman in vain, rather than the the actual truth or manifestation of Brahman. \n\nI also knew early on that you must have had a full Kundalini Awakening, since you understood the concepts you referred to in a similar manner to myself. I will maintain that Kundalini is essential for Moksha and achieving higher Samadhi states, precisely because it gets rid of duality (by uniting Shiva and Shakti) and creates a non-dual state of awareness with no mind and therefore no attributes or gunas. I remain sceptical whether true liberation can be achieved through any other means, especially if it only involves Jnana as understood by most people here, as book-learning.\n\nI should also note that Brahman never can have gunas or attributes, those are physical constraints, Brahman always remains outside of them and is infinite and boundless by its very nature. It cannot be bound by any attributes whatsoever. What does get bound to matter is the Jiva deciding to separate itself from the absolute and manifest through attributes like gunas, the ahamkara, samskaras and karma. All these are dualistic and therefore Brahman will forever remain untouched by them.\n\n### Comment ID jcfclaw with +2 score by [(Silver_Artichoke_531, Reddit, 2023-03-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvaitaVedanta/comments/11qds9j/the_experience_of_brahman_explained_the_nature_of/jcfclaw/) (in reply to ID jc65yy0):\nMany of your doubts are addressed directly in this post if you read through it carefully and diligently.

I will of course credit you as the author.\n\n## Comment ID jc8w2s8 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvaitaVedanta/comments/11qds9j/the_experience_of_brahman_explained_the_nature_of/jc8w2s8/) (in reply to ID 11qds9j):\nI have consciously embraced Brahman, my true self during my painful Vipassana experience. Surrendered not just my ego but also my mind and illusionary self... And now I am slowly losing grip with this reality. I am in a process of transcending it through a complete inner understanding of this illusion, there are no many mysteries or questions left in this reality for me. Feels like my mind is dissolving...\n\n## Comment ID jc9yr87 with +1 score by [(bobkryton, Reddit, 2023-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvaitaVedanta/comments/11qds9j/the_experience_of_brahman_explained_the_nature_of/jc9yr87/) (in reply to ID 11qds9j):\nTake care\n\n## Comment ID jccjfkl with +1 score by [(justht, Reddit, 2023-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvaitaVedanta/comments/11qds9j/the_experience_of_brahman_explained_the_nature_of/jccjfkl/) (in reply to ID 11qds9j):\nI've been reading (and rereading) from your post daily. I still have no words to express my gratitude.

      "# [Santi’s Health Status – Kevala Retreat](https://www.kevalaretreat.org/health/)\nAnemia (with shortness of breath, unusual fatigue) was discovered during my annual wellness check in mid-March. Exploring the cause of the anemia uncovered a mass in the cecum, which is being treated as high grade B-cell non-hodgkins lymphoma. The tumor is not nearly as large as the one found in 2010 and my health hasn’t deteriorated nearly as badly as then. However, I am 14 years older and a body can only take so much intensive chemo and all that entails. In-person teaching engagements were put on hold. On-line teaching will continue as much as possible. This page will update once or twice a week during treatment though July. Newest entries on top.\n\nFurther updates will be on https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/santikaro\n\n4. last weekend of April\n\nFeeling pretty good, all things considered, through 2nd chemo cycle at Mayo Clinic. Should go home Monday midday. Jo Marie and I had a long Friday with scan and lots of meetings, including prep for the stem cell “transplant/rescue.” We learned a lot about the latter, and have some clarification about the form of high grade b-cell lymphoma that occurred. It’s a little different than the tumor 13 years ago, and even more falls in-between the familiar forms of HGBCL. There are perhaps 50 documented cases of it.\n\nA third chemo cycle will start May 17. Ideally, the stem cell transplant/rescue process will start 4 weeks after that. We now, thanks to Dr Villasboas, have a pretty good idea of how that will play out. Expected to take 6 weeks, but could be longer or a little less. We are making the necessary logistical arrangements with family and friends. Preparing physically, emotionally, and Dhammically.\n\n3. third weekend of April\n\nBlood tests show that neutrophils and WBCs are coming back nicely, neutropenia is waning, and the immune system is functioning, though not fully up to speed. So I’ll have a few days of few meds, few side effects, low risk of infection, and much gratitude for a strong body that’s gotten through the first chemo cycle pretty well. Then, on Friday, we start the second cycle.\n\nMy primary duties will remain: eating as much and as well as I can, hydrating well, managing the meds, walking a lot, correspondence, and Dhamma practice.\n\nMany thanks to all the notes of condolence and warm well-wishing. Thanks, too, to everyone who contributed to the Guest House construction; it’s a wonderful place to recuperate and enjoy the valley views of springtime.\n\n2. mid-April\n\nA fever occurred when neutropenia arrived suddenly. I was hospitalized locally as a precaution to stabilize vitals and check for infections. Neutropenia is expected with this kind of intense chemo; neutrophils bottomed out at zero and started returning a day later. During the worst of neutropenia, there is extreme risk of infection, with sepsis a particular concern. Fortunately, the fever passed quickly and no infection has been found. Jo Marie brought me home on 4/17 after a few nights in La Crosse.",

The woman visited Ullal thrice in 2021 and 2022 when she was sexually assaulted, she said in her complaint.\n\nUllal made her believe that they had a relationship in their previous birth, spoke about “spirituality, energy work and divine love”, and sexually assaulted her, the complaint stated.

      "# [Kevala Foundation by admin on 2010-04-20](https://kevalafoundation.org/be-aware/)\nDear Friends,\n\nThere are several questions unanswered by spiritual gurus who masquerade as messiahs of the lord and take advantage of hapless devotees.\n\nThe current scandals add fuel to pertinent questions that surface whenever the so called saviours of humanity ditch their own ideals and assume that they are above all laws of karma, universe and claim their stature of enlightenment, which by no means is proven.\n\nSpirituality is a hazy battleground where there is no clarity for seekers and the game gets murkier when leaders themselves don’t know where they are headed.\n\nUnder the current scenario, its important to throw more light on this topic and awaken the powers of our intellect to discern between the fakes and our true guru within, which is our own soul, driven by our conscience.\n\nLet these provoking questions and contemplations help us explore further. This is a long mail. Read it fully at your leisure. I trust that it will resonate with the exploring spirit that is desperate to burst open to find out the truth.\n\n1. It becomes really evident that even the current crop of self-proclaimed greatest masters on this planet have no clue about their own future and what the universe has in store for them. Paramahamsa Nityananda claimed he has 360 degrees vision and can see through with clarity of his third eye and ultra-sensitive higher sense perception. This hyped skill fell short to identify the hidden video cam in his own ashram bedroom. His strong intuition failed to identify that he has bred foes in his own ashram by his autocratic style of leadership. He didn’t even foresee that he would be caught in the act on camera and would force him to escape from cops, and his own people. I haven’t met anyone who knows the entire picture of what future has in store for them how destiny is in a state of flux. But that doesn’t stop them from predicting other’s future.This reiterates adage that the universe remains a mystery that changes itself when it knows that someone is trying to know it. There is a saying that ‘Grace descends and man ascends’, but when the ascended man falls from elevated grace owing to his own misgivings, the fall becomes really nasty.\n\n2. Living with an enlightened master is apparently just a hyped marketing concept, as it turned out to be shocking experience for all the hapless aspirants. No one got to know that the private life of Swami Nityananda was a closely guarded secret and no one would ever get to know what it is to live with their master, while the glorified darshans would serve as a wow factor with the good looking swami decked up in gold, perched on an emperor’s seat and spewing commentaries on ancient vedas, yoga and shiva sutras. Little did the aspirants of Inner Awakening know that they would be rudely awakened by the sleazy happenings at Ananda Gandha- the quarters of the Swami. By looking at the sad faces of the volunteers in the ashram, it becomes very clear that someone has robbed them of their happiness, and their ananda is a concept meant to be sold to masses and not experienced amongst themselves.\n\n3. A great teacher like Osho Rajneesh was a creative genius who didn’t have to rely on just being a narrator of ancient wisdom which is made available by several great masters from the past. There is hardly anything new in Nityananda’s teachings, apart from re-packaging ancient philosophies with his lucid style of commentary. If you want to know in-depth about shiva sutras, just refer the ‘Book of Secrets’ – interpretation of vigyan bhairav tantra by Osho (audio also available) and you will get a clear comparison in difference in the levels of expertise and treatment of the meditation techniques (between osho and swami nityananda).\n\n4. Despite failures and misgivings of hundreds of cults in the past, the spiritual leaders continue to create autocratic institutions and design them into a neo-cult, so that they control their mesmerized followers, and drive the insiders by a hierarchical order that is subtly dictated by assumed slavery and obviously coded by color of skin, robes and fancy sanskrit names to define the cult.\n\n5. The scant disregard for true seekers of the these enlightened gurus becomes evident when politicians, film stars, VIPs get special treatment and long drawn private darshans while devotees in genuine need of support are standing in serpentine queues till wee hours of the night to get a thumbing on the forehead and false promises of boons. There is an obvious disparity in the way people are treated based on who they are and spiritual guidance always takes a back seat. The boom of youtube videos, spiritual channels on DTH TV only served as intelligent marketing communication vehicle for popularity, while the awe struck sadhakas beeline at ashrams only to discover that they are reduced to a frenzied fan in a mass hysteria ceremony to highlight the importance of the enlightened master. No one is allowed to ask any relevant question that can challenge the superiority of the master on any subject. You can expect to be promptly snubbed or thrown out by the ardent followers, if you doubt the integrity or skills of the master.\n\n6. Does a Master need to call himself one, if so, what mastery are we talking about. If we go to a traditional martial arts school, we can expect to see an expert who can willingly demonstrate feats that most trained people cannot perform. So the expertise is evident. But does that make him a master. There is always someone who is better than us and there is room for excellence and it never will be enough perfection. The disgusting aspect of so called spiritual masters is that they choose to vocalise their so called unseen skills rather than demonstrate it. Swami Rama of Himalayan tradition had the skills to demonstrate his amazing yogic powers at Merringer Research Institute in USA. These feats were super human and never recorded earlier in lab environment and hence revered by scientists. Despite such powers, Swami Rama never claimed that he was a Master and said that he is only a messenger from himalayas. The very term Master is pretty much abused. A true master doesn’t need to demonstrate his powers as he never claims to be a master. So there is no need for him to showcase his skills to win some students or please an audience. In the presence of an accomplished master, the expansion of our energies is obvious. For instance, the kundalini shakti instantly rose in people who were in the company of Ramana Maharishi. He was not even looking at his raving audience, his eyes were transfixed on the Arunachala hills, while he basked in Turiyeeta avasta (4th state of consciousness). Just his mere presence was enough while he made no claims nor mislead or persuade anyone.\n\nZen philosophy says we that a Master begins his day by being a student. This is called a Beginner’s Mind.\n\n7. Nityananda has claimed in his talks and books that ‘enlightenment’ is a big and serious responsibility and hence he has a immense task on hand. Now it is glaring that he has shockingly escaped his responsibility. He owes a response to his ardent followers and media. He has gone missing while no one knows his whereabouts. This is pathetic, considering the unofficial claims that he has 45 lakh followers in 17 countries. A captain of a ship will never abandon his ship, even if it is sinking. That’s why he is revered for that call of duty. Nityananda escaped when his ashrams and integrity were under threat. There is undoubtedly fear in his reactions. If the ashram vouches that the sex video is doctored and morphed, so why is their leader running away. Any person with a room temperature IQ having met the swami can make out that its the original swami exposed, If there is a body double that is lurching in the ashram, then Nityananda has to be really worried. Because the next inner awakening course will be conducted by some xyz-Ananda claiming to be the original Nityananda, who is going to mess with your happiness.\n\n8. There are hundreds of highly accomplished yogis meditating in the secluded caves of himalayas who never come into the open or sell their skills. They are truly blessing the world without any need for any recognition or fame. Such is our naivety that we get sold over to the large and popular institutionalized cult concepts. For instance 2012 has been enforced upon us as a cosmic event that is going to be impacting our consciousness. All these self-proclaimed saviours like Nityananda, Kalki Bhagwan and many such teachers have promised enlightenment for their thousands of devotees. Sadly for them, the universe had something else in store for them. They got busted in 2010, long before they could even imagine, what was going on or what hit them. As Ramana Maharshi also observed that the events are unfolding and we are witnessing without any control over them.\n\n9. Many skilled teachers have a humble beginning when they start imparting their skills to a few students. However the greed of power, money and fame overrides and their mission gets corrupted with the entry of unscrupulous ideas to make a quick buck in the name of charity. Many people pay hefty sums of money to get awakened but they become victims of a ‘cognitive dissonance’ which forces them to fabricate their experiences to match with the expectations of their peers.\n\n10. If you are going to be sitting in the midst of a 1000 plus, inspired chanters, the sheer collective consciousness and the group energy will bring about amazing sensory experiences in us. Its pure science, our electro-magnetic field is altered, this impacts our flow of prana, movement of chakras, and leads to temporary shift in our bio-energy. The hungry cult gurus cash on these personal experiences and quickly declare you awakened, only to disappoint you that this euphoria is not going to last, as you will need several more engineered courses to achieve enlightenment.\n\n10. Bharatkhand (as indian sub-continent is called) has been the spiritual engine of the world. We have a heritage that has been inspiring us. The contributions from the great Vedic Rishis, Mahavatar Babaji, Adi Shankaracharya, Patanjali, Chaitanya, Ramana Mahrishi, Shirdi Sai Baba, Bhagawan Nityananda (ganeshpuri), Gorakshnath, Ma Anandamayi, Siddhars, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Lahiri Mahasaya, Bengali Baba, Osho Rajneesh and so on, did not have to brag about their skills or stature but remained in the purity of their mission to awaken aspirants on their path to realize the true nature of the soul.\n\nInteresting Swami Nityananda once made an open statement the great Mahavatar Baba is his marketing agent, a haughty statement.\n\n11. There is nothing wrong in sex. Its a natural fountain of life like Food, Self Preservation, and Sleep. Sexual urge is so powerful that it can out-stage all idealisms and cultivated disciplines. However the claim that Paramahamsa, the eternal symbolism of sacred swan that doesn’t even land on the planet earth and claims that Nityananda was enlightened even before he even reached the age of puberty, hence does not need to indulge in sex was propagated. This raises the expectations out of a sacred celibate. Nityanandam – his blissful state of mind was celebrated in dozens of lilting musical compositions sold in audio cds. Why would a state of eternal bliss (that spiritual seekers are dying to achieve) fall prey to a 20 second sexual orgasm that any lowly mortal can achieve is an answer that Nityananda owes to everyone.\n\nHis teachers even made open claims during Kalpataru programs that by chanting ‘Om Hreem Nityanandaya Namah’, you will achieve the phenomenal Ashta Siddhi (super normal powers of control over space, time, nature, body, and so on). I bet not a single ashramite has achieved any of these siddhis.\n\n12. Nityananda definitely has some demonstrated meditative skills. For instance, ability to show no activity in the brain was demonstrated by bring the Beta, Alpha, Theta, Delta and Gamma brain waves to Zero activity on the EEG instrument. For your knowledge there are Meditators like Ken Wilber who have demonstrated the same skills. He has made no claims to enlightenment. You can see his videos on youtube.\n\n13. On the occasion of 60th birthday celebrations of Kalki Bhagwan. there was a live video to be webcasted. The video was subscribed over zealously on the net and promptly the video frames froze and no one could see the live video. Interestingly just before the video was to be telecasted, one of his top Dasaji made some glorious statements about Bhagwan and went to the extent of saying that his Bhagwan was not even born out of human womb, and I also read incredible statement from an official website that Kalki Bhagwan has created the entire universe. It would be extremely disappointing for any awakened devotee to learn that their God was not even capable of overcoming the network bottleneck on a celebrated occasion. Interestingly the devotees were all in anticipation for the expected boons from Bhagwan on his birthday as promised. Deservingly, even the ever-penetrating golden balls remained dormant in their own little universe created at the oneness university in India. In a human body, we can have human experiences, not necessarily spiritual experiences. All these teachers are human like us, who have walked a few more steps ahead of us, which doesn’t qualify them to have the entire universe in their control or know everything. They are as fallible, insecure, fragile and human like us. So why are we so bent upon creating super heroes, demi-gods and idols by chasing some idealism that is far-fetched for own good.\n\n14. History has its way of repeating itself. Many fake swamis with their strong political nexus have bounced back from thunderous scandals and resumed their operations. There is drift in our way of life that is triggered by global recession, political upheavals, natural calamities, guru busting, etc. No one has a complete picture what is in store for future. The sooth sayers, clairvoyants, and self proclaimed masters are as clueless as we are. We can live our lives with little awareness, one moment at a time, and stay connected positively for a common good of humanity. Let the trust within us become even more reinforced with the true GURU within each of us. The universe works through people. We have to thank a few people who put their lives at stake and expose the monsters hiding in the mask of demi-gods.\n\nPS: I have no claims to any official sources of information or direct knowledge, nor written this to influence anyone to deviate from their life choices, beliefs or way of living. However I pray that each one of us will muster the courage to ask all the troublesome questions now, and seek clarity amidst all these confusions.\n\nBreath is our prayer,\n\nMeditation is our path\n\nConsciousness is our God\n\nHumanity is our Religion\n\nLove, Light, Consciousness\n\nDr.Pradeep Ullal",

      "# [Police: Yoga teacher booked for raping NRI multiple times by Coovercolly Indresh on 2024-09-04](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-yoga-teacher-booked-for-raping-nri-multiple-times-101725391142607.html)\nThe officer said that yoga instructor identified as Pradeep Ullal, 53, heads the “Kevala Foundation,” which has been running an ashram in Chikkamagaluru for two decades. He has been arrested on charges of raping an American doctor under the pretext of a spiritual relationship that he claimed existed between them in a previous life.\n\n“Based on complaint filed by NRI doctor, we booked Ullal under IPC section 376(rape) on Sunday and launched an investigation into the matter,’’ Chikkamagaluru rural police station inspector Sachin Kumar said. The police has registered the case under IPC as the alleged rape took place between 2021 and 2022.\n\nThe NRI doctor, a US citizen, came in contact with him through social media and started taking online yoga classes from the instructor. The survivor, originally from Punjab and now settled in California, filed a complaint at Chikkamagaluru Rural police station. She alleged that she was lured into Ullal’s spiritual teachings and later manipulated into visiting his yoga centre in Mallenahalli multiple times between 2021 and 2022.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the woman first came into contact with Ullal in 2020 through a mutual friend. She began practising yoga under his guidance online and was later invited to visit his centre in Mallenahalli. During her first visit on November 1, 2021, she stayed for 21 days. It was during this time that Ullal allegedly began his manipulation, convincing her that they had a deep, spiritual connection from a previous life, the woman alleged in her complaint.\n\nShe alleged that Ullal, under the guise of performing “energy work”, and sharing “divine love” coerced her into sexual acts, claiming these were necessary for her spiritual progress. She returned to California and was called to Mallenahalli again in February 2022, where she stayed for 10 days. During this period, she alleged that Ullal raped her multiple times.\n\nThe survivor stated that she visited the centre again in July 2022 for a 21-day stay, during which she was raped two or three more times. The woman also revealed that she became pregnant as a result of the assaults and unfortunately, the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. Ullal the allegedly manipulated the situation further, referring to the ordeal implying that such events were divinely orchestrated, she alleged.\n\nIn addition to the physical and emotional abuse, the woman also claimed that she had been financially exploited by Ullal. She alleged that she had given him gifts worth approximately ₹20 lakh, including a music system, Kashmiri carpets, two laptops, and various other items. She said that Ullal had deceived many people by presenting himself as a spiritual guide and yoga instructor, police said.\n\n“Followed by complaint, we arrested Pradeep Ullal and produced him before JMFC court Chikkamagalurui ‘’ investigation officer Sachin Kumar told HT. “He has hundreds of followers. We are investigating whether he was involved in similar incidents in the ashram. Currently he is in judicial custody.”\n\nWhen HT attempted to contact Kevala foundation, none picked phone.",

      "# [girivalam @ Arunachala by admin on 2011-10-19](https://kevalafoundation.org/girivalam-arunachala/)\nArunachala-the true embodiment of Shiva. Every stone, leaf, insect, cave, sand here is divine. If you look carefully on the top of the hill, you will see Shiva with his face upwards looking at Mt sumeru.\n\nThe plan to be in Arunachala coincided with my visit to Chikmagalur where we are planning to set up Kevala Celebration Center. The word spread quickly to my spiritual brother Parthibhan at chikmagalur. He promised to join us with his entire family and be a part of this sacred journey to cleanse our karmas. So this became the first spiritual retreat of Kevala Foundation.\n\nWe landed in Thiruvannamalai at about 10:30 am in the morning. It was the 11th of october. We watched several hundreds of people walking on the approach roads. I was told that this is the outer path around arunachala which is a paved one and dotted with shops, temples and attracts a lot of crowds including people driving past the trekkers in their fancy cars.\n\nWe quickly checked into a hotel, aptly called Arunachala Ramana Home. A board hung outside stated “Roof Top view of Arunachala”. I dumped my bags quickly in some of the rooms and raced up the stairs to the terrace. True to their word, the view of the hill was picture perfect. Arunachala was beckoning with its mighty grace. The magnetic pull of the hill was so powerful that I couldn’t take my eyes off the peak. The hues began to shift and there was something happening there which was beginning to reveal more.\n\nI wanted to see more than what my eyes could gather. I just prayed to Shiva- please show me your real form. Within a few moments, there was a light form of shiva dazzling and blazing on the top of the hill, and I was revealed how to view the contour of hills. Shiva was indeed lying with his face up to the sky, as if gazing deeply into the immense vastness, with his consciousness pervading every atom of space in the physical universe.\n\nSoon i was joined by Vijaya, Bhuvana, Deepa, Akhila and Parthi on the terrace. They were also basking in the beautiful sight of Arunachala. I asked Deepa, if she wanted to know how it feels to be on the top of Arunachala. She said yes! I told her to place her hands above my head. Within a few moments, she said she could feel that her hands were chill and currents were passing through her.\n\nWe had lunch at Seshadri Swamingal Ashram. Most of us had a small helping of curd rice. A light meal was ideal as we wanted to take the “inner Core” path around Arunachala. In local lingo its called Girivalam which basically means circum-ambulation around the hill. We called upon the services of a local guide. Soon enough a tall, thin man called Jagan walked into our room. He claimed to know the inner path very well and cited that he was featured in the best blog site of arunachala by an explorer called Richard. I faintly recalled seeing his pic on the site and we instantly entrusted him to offer his services.\n\nThe entry for the inner core path is behind the serene Ramana ashram. Walking past ramana ashram brought back fond memories of being with this great master. There is a statue of him seated on a platform in a meditation hall. The statue is so true to life that one can just visualize Ramana Maharishi seated with his gaze locked into Arunachala. I thanked the master again for inspiring me on the path of liberation.\n\nWe were a group of 12 people who set foot on the inner core path of Arunachala. We must have walked about a mile inside when we saw a large rock. Our guide said this is where Ramana used to sit and watch Arunachala. I sat there for a while and enjoyed the vibrations of the space that once was occupied by one of the greatest enlightened beings to have walked on this plane.\n\nWe walked around in the path that was full of pleasant smells emanating from the bushes around. Jagan our guide said that many siddhars in astral form were operating in arunachala and the divine aroma that wafted through the air indicated their presence. Very few people undertake the inner core path, and its almost ordained as to who deserves to take up this path. The walk in outer path around arunachala is a karma cleansing kriya while the walking in the inner core path is taking a into the path of dissolution.\n\nI insisted Jagan not to miss out any single cave, even if it meant deviation from the route. He agreed and kept gliding over the rocks and negotiating through the thorny bushes as if it never existed. Jagan only stopped only when he wanted to point out significance of the rock formation in arunachala. The arunachala is easily the most stunning,natural rock formation I have come across. All the sacred symbolism, geometry is depicted in these formations which accentuates the age old cliche that truth is stranger than fiction.\n\nWe saw a rock that the face of Nandhi- the vehicle of Shiva, and then as we passed, all the seven chakras came along the way. There was a deep inner churning happening within the spine. It is so easy to miss all these subtle aspects if our mind is lost in chatter, or occupied in the physical aspect of the walk. The trek may seem just like a breeze. But the 16 km track is more cleansing than any average mind can capture. A true aspirant on the path of exploration will appreciate every bit of the journey.\n\nCAVES ALONG THE PATH:\n\nMany thousands of siddhars have done tapas in the caves of arunachala for millions of years. Their combined energies serve as a booster for any sincere meditator to experience the depth of their service to humanity.\n\nSome of the caves that we visited are Virupaksha Cave(Virupaksha is deeply associated with Sri Ramana Maharshi. Ramana lived here for 17 years [1899-1916]. The cave is named after a famous saint, Virupaksha, who lived in this cave in the 1500′s, around the same time as Guhai Nama Shivaya lived nearby. At Virupaksha’s demise, called here ‘maha samadhi,’ it is said that his body was transformed into vibhuti (sacred ash). In the interior of this cave there is a mound in the shape of Arunachala. It is said to be made of this vibhuti.\n\nSkandashram:\n\nSri Ramana lived at Skandashram from 1916 to 1922. His mother joined him during this period, and for the first time, cooking was done there. This is where his mother had her maha samadhi in 1922. Her room is now a shrine. What isthe most significant aspect of the caves is the unmistakable cosmic energy that pulls upwards from the crown as soon as we enter it. This is the magnetic pull of shiva and it is so obvious that so many masters have left behind their blessings for many aspirants to get a glimpse of extent of what is possible through dhyana.\n\nWe meditated at many rock caves and also mediated with a french baba whose amazing stillness baffled all of us. The caves are difficult to approach as there are many thorny bushes to negotiate, and they are so cut off from regular path that one does need a local guide to access them. We managed to spend good time soaking in the immense vibrations and it was definitely a treat to be there and seek the blessings of the siddhars.\n\nThere was a deep pull to do tapas in these caves, but the fact that we are in a group of children and women and had to return back to our hotel before dark stayed as a reminder in the sub-conscious when I immersed deeper in the meditation. Those precious moments just were a recall factor of meditating in past lives in these caves.\n\nIn one of the shakti caves, i received a message that we are going to be with Nagaraja (serpent king). It was not a physical encounter with a snake. We entered into a cave next day and all details of this serpent protected cave is in next blog of climbing arunachala.\n\nWe made our way through dense bushes and precariously aligned rocks at a rapid pace. The time we spent in the caves meant that we had to complete the walk before dark. I could sense many tired legs in our group, but the indomitable spirit took on.\n\nSainath was getting bogged down by the immense karmic churning happening within and add to it, he was under anti biotic medication. He seemed to get heavier every step. Thats when i came down to his assistance. There was an immense surge in my energy as I held his hand and guided him at a frenetic pace along the hill. The fact that he is 25 kilograms heavier than me and the ease at which i dragged him the steep rocks was enough for him to understand of how kundalini power comes to the rescue and the not to forget the unseen hands and unmistakable support of the siddhars.\n\nAs we treaded along the path, we saw katti shiva cave and a medicinal pool. we had hardly much time to spend at the cave as the setting sun reminded us of the pending journey.\n\nJagan relied on his ancient technique of restricting the pending distance to our hotel as 2 kms and everyone kept walking endlessly and joked with him that this measure must be most imaginative by any standards.\n\nWe saw the glorious full moon peeking out of the clouds. The devotees below were getting ready for walk along the outer path of arunachala. Jagan showed us the spectacular views of all significant angles of arunachala. In the fading light, the magnificent body of shiva was inviting me to take the climb the next morning at 5 am. When we reached the town limits after walking through the inner path, we saw crowds pouring into the streets. It was like a carnival that carried through the night.\n\nThere were street musicians raising the festive fervour, while temples and road side restaurants made quick business as the crowds swelled. The whole town is an extended temple, dotted by ashrams, hotels, road side cafes, street hawkers, and a lot of rubbish on overt display.\n\nDespite all the noise, dust, rubbish on the streets, thiruvunnamalai continues to attract sincere aspirants who quickly learn to focus on their main objective of the journey,which is a lesson in itself. The first day of girivalam on full moon night was just a deep seated opening of flood gates of ascending currents that were waiting for us the next morning.\n\nWe thanked Jagan for his guidance without which this trip to caves on the inner path would not have been possible.\n\nI have shared some images below of our journey:\n\nhttps://picasaweb.google.com/111190197318669060612/ForWeb02?authkey=Gv1sRgCMGh7ZHchePIKA#\n\nLove\n\nPradeep Ullal",

EIS Part 1 examines the potential impacts of high adoptions of DERs on the distribution grid. The study presents a granular bottom-up load forecasting methodology that provides information on where and when distribution grid enhancements and investment may be needed to support grid reliability and provides a preliminary estimate on the potential costs of meeting these needs by California’s three largest investor-owned utilities (IOUs).\n\nThe Electrification Impact Study Part 1 Workshop was held on May 17th, 2023.\n\nAgenda\n\nPresentation\n\nRecording\n\nData Portals\n\nData portals hosted by PG&E, SCE, and SDG&E provide extensive geospatial mapping data to the public about the electric distribution grid. The purpose of the portals is to support DER siting. Among the data hosted are Integration Capacity Analysis (ICA) data, which are designed to help contractors and developers identify project sites where existing grid infrastructure has capacity available to interconnect new DERs. A January 27, 2021 Ruling for the DRP proceeding directed the IOUs’ to refine their ICA online maps to ensure the data are accurate and increase usability.\n\nPG&E’s data portal is available here.\n\nSCE’s data portal is available here.\n\nSDG&E’s data portal is available here.\n\nData validation were prepared for PG&E, SCE, and SDG&E pursuant to the January 27, 2021 Ruling. A September 9, 2021, Ruling required refinements to the data portals.\n\nData Portals Workshop\n\nThe CPUC held a Data Portals Improvement Workshop on July 26, 2022. This workshop informed participants about the utility data portals, which include the Integrated Capacity Analysis, Grid Needs Assessment, and Locational Net Benefit Analysis. The panelists shared feedback received to date on how to improve the data portals and solicited feedback from workshop attendees. The discussion included information about the grid planning in California.\n\nAgenda\n\nPresentation\n\nProceeding Documents\n\nDistribution Planning Community Engagement Needs Assessment Workshop\n\nThe CPUC held a workshop on December 13th, 2022.

DERs as alternatives to traditional grid investments are commonly referred to as non-wires alternatives. The DIDF was established in decision D.18-02-004.\n\nThe process requires annual filings by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE), and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E). The annual filings are called Grid Needs Assessment and Distribution Deferral Opportunity Reports (GNA/DDORs). Within the filings, the three utilities propose a list of DER opportunities most likely to successfully defer a traditional grid investment. An advisory group of stakeholders called the Distribution Planning Advisory Group reviews the GNA/DDOR filings. After review, the utilities seek to procure DERs for the selected opportunities.\n\nExtensive information about the DIDF process is provided in the implementing decision and the series of Administrative Law Judge rulings that refined the process. The Rulings are available at the DRP proceeding website (R.14-08-013). A summary of process updates and outcomes is provided in California’s Grid Modernization Report prepared by the CPUC.\n\nThe section addresses high-level policy issues concerning the roles and responsibilities of distribution system operators, as well as utility and aggregator business models. This track tackles long-term policy matters and may lead to findings that require action beyond the timeframe of this OIR.\n\nFuture Grid Study\n\nIn August 2023, the CPUC released an Amended Scoping Memo in Rulemaking R.21-06-017. The amended scoping memo alters Track 2 of the rulemaking by assuming that the electric investor-owned utilities (IOUs) remain in their current role as distribution system operators. The Future Grid Study is now based on the following two scoping questions:\n\n1. What are the operational needs necessary to efficiently operate a high DER grid, unlock economic opportunities for DERs to provide grid services, limit market power, reduce ratepayer costs, increase equity, support grid resiliency, and meet State policy objectives?\n\n2. What are the existing gaps and barriers in achieving the needs identified above within our current Distribution System Operator (Utilities)? What are the potential solutions in overcoming these barriers?\n\nTrack 2 of the rulemaking now focuses on how to ensure DER deployment provides the maximum possible value to the grid through effective distribution system operations. To tackle this, the Future Grud Study Workshop Series was hosted by Gridworks and the CPUC to foster collaboration and innovation amongst the IOUs. The workshop series will consist of three workshops:\n\nWorkshop Series: The Future Grid Study\n\nWorkshop 1: Identifying Operational Needs\n\nFebruary 8th, 2024, from 1:00pm to 5:00pm.\n\nThe first of three workshops brought together utilities and parties to discuss and address the first question in Track 2 of the High DER Proceeding scoping memo: what are the operational needs necessary to efficiently operate a high DER grid, unlock economic opportunities for DER to provide grid services, limit market power, reduce ratepayer costs, increase equity, support grid resiliency and meet State policy objects?\n\nAgenda\n\nPresentations & Other Resources [California Future Grid Study – Gridworks]\n\nWorkshop recording\n\nWorkshop 2: Assessing Gaps\n\nMarch 12th, 2024 from 11:00am to 5:00pm\n\nIn the next part of the workshop series, the goal was to provide answers to the first half of the second question listed in the scoping memo: What are the existing gaps and barriers in achieving the needs identified [as discussed in Workshop 1] within our current Distribution System Operator (Utilities)?\n\nPre-Workshop [Survey]\n\nAgenda\n\nWorkshop recording\n\nWorkshop 3: Developing Recommendations to Address Gaps\n\nMay 1st, 2024 from 11:00am to 5:00pm\n\nThe last workshop of this series worked with parties involved to find potential solutions to overcome the barriers found during the gap assessment in workshop 2, this final session focused on concreting recommendations for the Commission to address identified gaps.\n\nAgenda\n\nWorkshop Recording\n\nA more thorough description of the workshop series, along with background material, is available on the Gridworks Website Future Grid Study Overview\n\nEducation and Outreach Workshop\n\nThe workshop aimed to educate stakeholders on distribution planning and Distribution System Operator (DSO) topics to facilitate meaningful engagement in the High DER proceeding.
