(A Franciscan/VM hospital in Western WA) they get anywhere from $15-$18 PER HOUR bonuses often. Does anyone else want to share about bonuses at their hospitals? I am in home care right now making $19 at my over the table job, and $25 at my under the table job. But I am interested in switching to a hospital for benefits and 3 12s instead of working 5 days a week... I was gonna get hired at a Multicare hospital in January but they were only offering $17.75 per hour and for the drive I didn't want to take the pay cut. But yes....tell me about bonuses at your hospitals. And how common they are.\n\n## Comment ID inntdgu with +11 score by [(Accidentalmom, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cna/comments/x9fe00/hospital_bonuses/inntdgu/) (in reply to ID x9fe00):\nI make 15 an hour base but pick up an extra shift a week. An extra 12 hour shift is a $600 bonus plus double overtime which usually amounts to almost $1k. I also work night shift so I make a little extra.\n\n### Comment ID inntlzn with +1 score by [(littlemama253, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cna/comments/x9fe00/hospital_bonuses/inntlzn/) (in reply to ID inntdgu):\nWhere are you located!?/ what is your hospital system?\n\n#### Comment ID ino268q with +5 score by [(Accidentalmom, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cna/comments/x9fe00/hospital_bonuses/ino268q/) (in reply to ID inntlzn):\nLocated in sc but don’t feel comfortable stating where lol.

I am in western WA (way western, like on the coast) working an SNF/LTC, I have less than 1 year of experience and 1 year of nursing school. I make 24/hr with shift diff and an extra $4 per hour on shifts I pick up, which is quite a few as I am per diem. Not sure why you’re getting paid so low in a similar area.

I get premium/differentials so my average wage is \\~27/hr not including overtime. We are also super short staffed, so they have callback pay for people who pick up shifts on super slim days- this is 1.5x pay plus differentials plus overtime.

I can't find anything like it, the closest I can get to is [Connecteam](https://connecteam.com/), but it seems more like a full staffing kind of thing not meant for tempoary staff. I assume something like ShiftMed or CareRev is created by developers just for that company, we are small so we don't have that kind of money.

Based on three key factors: \n\n* A set of high material quality-of-life indicators coinciding  with moderate per-capita incomes, both distributed across nearly the  entire population of Kerala.\n* A set of wealth and resource redistribution programmes that have  largely brought about the high material quality-of-life indicators.\n* High levels of political participation and activism among ordinary  people along with substantial numbers of dedicated leaders at all  levels. Kerala's mass activism and committed cadre were able to function  within a largely democratic structure, which their activism has served  to reinforce.\n\nKerala's unusual socioeconomic and demographic situation was summarized by author and environmentalist [Bill McKibben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_McKibben):\n\n>Kerala, a state in India, is a bizarre anomaly among developing  nations, a place that offers real hope for the future of the Third  World. Though not much larger than Maryland, Kerala has a population as  big as California's and a per capita annual income of less than $300.   But its infant mortality rate is very low, its literacy rate among the  highest on Earth, and its birthrate below America's and falling faster.   Kerala's residents live nearly as long as Americans or Europeans.   Though mostly a land of paddy-covered plains, statistically Kerala  stands out as the Mount Everest of social development; there's truly no  place like it.\n\nI'm surprised I haven't seen it cited by more socialists and communists, since these policies were first created by a communist named EMS.

Racist memes about street shitting in India are easily countered by demonstrating that it is communists who ended this. \n\nHowever, we shouldn't be dishonest: Kerala is at best a social democracy that is also financed a lot through remittances from Indian guest workers in the UAE and Saudi-Arabia. This is nothing the CPI(M) should be blamed for, as far as I can see it, they are still a revolutionary party, but they are doing what they can within in the constraints of an Indian state, but at least they're doing a much better job than the neoliberal hellscape that is imposed on the rest of India by the BJP.\n\n### Comment ID fgldhqe with +1 score by [(hungarian_conartist, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgldhqe/) (in reply to ID fgizv5e):\n>because it proves that a communist party is actually electable and doesn't immediately cause a famine or whatever when in power.\n\nNo it doesn't.

As background, I'm an American-born Indian who visits Kerala every year or so to see my relatives. Here are my observations. \n\nFirst, if you visit the area, you'll find scores of unemployed or underemployed men and women. \n\nSecond, the young people of Kerala (excepting those who are not particularly highly-educated and home-bodies) by and large seek to immigrate to the West for higher education; most do not come back. The region is experiencing a brain and talent drain. This is not sustainable in the twenty-first century.\n\nThird, starting a small business in the area is exceedingly difficult, as worker strikes, power outages, and labor shortages pose significant challenges to successful operation. \n\nFourth, many multinational corporations are hesitant about investing in the state given these conditions. \n\nFifth, many parts of Kerala would be considered risky for women to walk alone in, even during the daylight, as there is, unfortunately, a large contingent of unemployed men who seemingly have nothing better to do than make women feel uncomfortable; when my wife and I visited Kerala last January, she experienced this. \n\nSixth, and this is my anecdotal observation, alcoholism is a chronic problem in many households as the men do not have steady and sufficient employment. \n\nSeventh, if you ask Kerala expats who live in the United States whether they would ever go back and live in Kerala, the answer will virtually always be no. I asked my father if he would go back to Kerala, and while he occasionally makes statements about returning to the old country (which men of a certain generation do, I suppose), he would never follow through on this, a position held by many ex-Keralites. In my dad's words, even making minimum wage in America at Wal-Mart, while not ideal, would be better by sheer virtue of being in America. The safety-net in Kerala is only one in name and does not guarantee any upward mobility. At least in America, one can use the safety-net to move forward. In fact, this is what my parents, both of whom are Kerala expats, did in the 1980s. Their American success story is literally impossible to achieve in Kerala.\n\nSo yes, high literacy is great, but let us not be deluded into thinking that Kerala is a great success story. It is doing better than other parts of India, which is important, but this misses the existential and spiritual crisis one feels upon landing at the airport there. Everytime I go back, I thank God my parents had the foresight to leave before my siblings and I were born.\n\nEdit: added clarifying details and organization.\n\n### Comment ID fgj01ue with +27 score by [(XasthurWithin, Reddit, 2020-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgj01ue/) (in reply to ID fgiy34y):\nThat you don't have international corporations and constant labour strikes isn't necessarily a bad thing.\n\nHow is Kerala compared to the rest of India?\n\n#### Comment ID fgj0jmu with +23 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgj0jmu/) (in reply to ID fgj01ue):\nMost of his point can hardly be linked to the \"model\" in my uninformed opinion\n\n#### Comment ID fgj1l8q with +19 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgj1l8q/) (in reply to ID fgj01ue):\nFirst, I would challenge your assumption that not having international corporations and having constant labor strikes is fine. \n\n**Multinational companies provide streams of capital.** These companies build factories, invest in job-training centers, support educational facilities, and create incentives for local government to attract better talent. Without these incentives, a government bureaucrat tends to look at local problems through the lens of \"good enough,\" as in \"these roads are good enough for us, why invest in paving them\" or \"these power cuts are fine, there aren't any factories depending on them.\"\n\n**Multinational corporations provide local employment.** If you step outside of the developed world for a moment, the average person works in an agriculture-related position. Almost 70% of the jobs found in the poorest countries of the world are based on this industry, compared to less than 5% which is located in the wealthiest nations in the world. Multinationals come in, offer higher wages (which are still low compared to global standards), then shift the standard of living. The average real wages have almost tripled since 2018 in the developing and emerging G20 countries since 2008. For example, India had the highest levels, achieving an index rating of 5.5 compared to the regional 3.7 average.\n\n**Multinational corporations help incentive improving the local infrastructure.** Similar to discussion from the first point, companies must have employees who can access job sites to become productive. That means an investment in the local infrastructure becomes necessary before operations even begin. Roads, bridges, and technology access are three of the largest barriers taken down when multinationals become active in a developing country. You’ll see education investments to improve labor skills, along with public transportation development and other unique needs that some nations may require. In Kerala, the shoddy infrastructure means that a major car company like Toyota would never come because power cuts and outages would be significantly disruptive to the regional supply chain. \n\n**Multinational corporations help diversify local economies.** Many parts of India rely on primary products for subsistence. These products tend to be related to agriculture-based industries. Multinationals provide the economies of regions in the developing world with more variety, creating diversity in local production levels. That reduces reliance on commodities which often have volatile prices because their supply and demand levels waiver so often.\n\nHappy to discuss this further, but these are the thoughts that immediately come to my mind regarding your first sentence. Yes, multinationals aren't perfect, and we can certainly list ways in which multinationals aren't great for the developing world. But, on the whole, they tend to be better than they aren't. \n\nKerala is slightly ahead of India in some areas, but to call it a success story is like saying a car with three flat tires is significantly better than a car with four flat tires. In my opinion, Kerala's story is tragic because, whereas other parts of India have lower literacy and higher infant mortality, those highly-literate Keralites leave home and never come back. Accordingly, the population demographics of Kerala have, and will continue to, become older and older. Again, this is not sustainable. Anecdotally, I would say Kerala has maybe twenty years left before it becomes like any other under-developing state in India.\n\n#### Comment ID fgkgzwv with +3 score by [(ReckingFutard, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgkgzwv/) (in reply to ID fgj01ue):\nIts unemployment rate is way above average.\n\n#### Comment ID fglcebn with +1 score by [(hungarian_conartist, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fglcebn/) (in reply to ID fgj01ue):\nKeralan economy is reliant on remittances from the young supporting parents by working overseas in the west or places like Saudi Arabia.

But it's not as great as often represented.\n\n**Low entrepreneurship**\n\nThe model is practically set to not reward risk taking behaviour such as entrepreneurship. In the short run, this doesn't make much difference. In the long run, this is severely detrimental to growth.\n\n**Low business friendliness**\n\nMultinational companies are less willing to invest in Kerala. Not surprising, since the govt does not have very friendly policy for businesses. So they invest in other places - Hyderabad, Bangalore, Delhi etc. \n\n**High brain drain**\n\nThis ties into the above two. If people don't have new and exciting avenues to work in, they leave. Kerala has one of the highest expat populations. A state that leaks resources like that will not continue this for long.\n\nThen there's the fact that there are a lot of other factors at play that you have ignored. \nIt is true that Kerala has a moderately rich populace. But it is also true that Kerala is a thin state on a sea shore, by which I mean to say that almost all the state has access to the sea, which automatically means greater prosperity. If it were land locked and had a similar accomplishment, now that would be quite a feat. A coastal state being richer than others, that's not really an anomaly. \n\n\nThen there's social reforms. Kerala boasts of a lot of social reformers, something the rest of India can not. This led to a breakdown of repressive social values. Couples with the fact that a lot of Malyali communities had a status of women unparalleled in the rest of India, Kerala had far higher *hands on deck*, as they say. \n\n\n*I'm posted in India and I have a Malyali girlfriend.*\n\n## Comment ID fgl0acs with +2 score by [(nedstarkin, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgl0acs/) (in reply to ID eyrn7s):\nJust to add one point here.

But now for what might be a bit of a hot take: new systems should never base themselves on any existent system, no matter how successful that system may be, at least not heavily. The circumstances in which systems come into being and function are always unique, and they can cause systems that would otherwise fail to be successful and systems that would otherwise be successful to fail. There are lessons to be learned from Kerala, and from Cuba, and Burkina Faso, and other countries. But using one as a model is dangerous business and individual examples of various systems in action are unreliable indicators of the viability of a certain method.

Kerala works for Keralites and maybe other impoverished communities in the Third World, but it's not universally applicable.\n\n## Comment ID fgl1hkv with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgl1hkv/) (in reply to ID eyrn7s):\nUnemployment is a huge problem in Kerela.

A different kind of Communist party.\n\n> CPI's 1957 constitution stated it would allow the existence of opposing parties after it had parliamentary majority. Party leaders, like Namboodiripad, did not like the idea of using military force to remain in power because it would reflect poorly on the CPI as a whole on a global stage. This reliance on the people's opinions created a benevolent communist government, but it also made it more difficult to enact radical reforms. **Therefore, the reforms of the CPI in Kerala were mainly moderately socialist.**\n\nMaybe not Communist at all.\n\n---\n\n> **Agrarian reform**         \nOne of the major changes advocated by the CPI was the Agrarian Relations Bill, passed in 1961. The bill was intentionally moderate because those drafting it knew it would have to pass through many constitutional channels before it would be made into a law. Over 1,000 amendments were debated due to party divisions. **Though the bill was moderate, it still changed the farming system. It abolished feudalism and aimed to create a   \n ---> capitalist <---   \nagricultural system. The CPI did not push more radical Communist land reforms. Namboodiripad stated they would not attempt state ownership or collective farms because even though such ideas might appeal to intellectuals on a scientific basis, they would not actually help the peasantry in practice**. \n\nYes! They are not typical Communist morons and they know Marxist pseudo-intellectuals are full of shit.\n\n> The bill aimed to improve wages and working conditions as well as secure employment. Landlords were only allowed to work on their land if they paid compensation, which helped protect the tenants’ rights.\n\n---\n\n> **Industrial reform**       \n> As the CPI in Kerala was ultimately controlled by the federal government, its state plan depended on the funds it could raise independently. It struggled to industrialize and develop new manufacturing plants in Kerala throughout the 1960s while balancing out the disparities of industrialization. The CPI had Industries ministers who were responsible for industrial development. It also had an Industrial Development Cooperation that gave financial assistance to companies to help them startup new manufacturing projects. In the early 1970s, the CPI created two new corporations to help with industrial development: the Kerala Industrial and Technical Consultancy Organization and the Kerala State Electronics Development Corporation. These measures improved industry on a state level, but were less successful at the local level. **To revitalize local industry, the CPI launched an ambitious Four-Year Plan, perhaps modeling itself after Stalin's Five-Year Plans which Namboodiripad considered an inspiration. The Four-Year Plan involved district-level conventions to excite potential entrepreneurs since the government wanted more private investors to spur industry. These entrepreneurs were trained to set up their own industries. The plan was hugely successful within the first 6 weeks and managed to set up eleven new industrial estates, but then lagged as the program continued.**\n\nIt seems the government in Kerala calls itself Communist and wide eyed innocents like you and your sources believe it, but they are actually pursuing moderate policies. \n\nCiting Stalin's five year plan is odd, but their actual plan was exactly the opposite of Stalin's. It was **\"to excite entrepreneurs since the government wanted more private investors to spur industry (!!!).\"**  while Stalin wanted to crush entrepreneurs to concentrate all power in the hands of the party, the stupidest policy ever.\n\n### Comment ID fgiy7fq with +5 score by [(SternerStirner, Reddit, 2020-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgiy7fq/) (in reply to ID fgivweq):\n........You say that buddy is looking for a successful Socialist government then proceed to say that Kerala isn't Communist, it's Moderate Communist, which is Socialist, in ideological terms not internal Commie terms.

I think yoga definitely primes the soul for such question, for a search of balance.\n\n## Comment ID kqcaj82 with +172 score by [(hallgod33, Reddit, 2024-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqcaj82/) (in reply to ID 1aqcn4y):\nI'm probably against the grain here, but what exactly did you expect working in finance? \"Opened your third eye\"? Dude, finance is literally metrics, and growth is the name of the game. Your job was to grow people's money and grow the business's money. You handle people's livelihood's fruits and must sow the seeds adequately. If you aren't doing that, obviously you'd be let go. It's not personal, it's literally just the job... don't use yoga as an excuse for why you weren't a good fit for that job. Acceptance, honesty, and open-mindedness are like, the cornerstones of yoga.\n\n### Comment ID kqcda5z with +46 score by [(Dopaminedrip1891, Reddit, 2024-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqcda5z/) (in reply to ID kqcaj82):\nExactly.

Maybe yoga has made you more conscious that you don't want to pretend to care about hitting constantly moving targets. Maybe you have discovered something about your core beliefs or sense of purpose, and your job didn't align with that.\n\nI don't know you, so I can't speak to whether you are depressed or should be on meds, but it's great you have the support of a therapist because it seems like you are in a transition in your life.\n\n#### Comment ID kqd9oto with +23 score by [(mimegallow, Reddit, 2024-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqd9oto/) (in reply to ID kqcda5z):\nThat is not “textbook depression”. \nBecoming aware that infinite growth is unsustainable and/or that capitalism is definitionally evil, and wanting to become personally valid or ethically consistent is not a “symptom”.\n\nYou’re right and you’re fine. \nClinical Depression is when you react inappropriately and you don’t have a just and rational cause.

Everything is bright and alive and dancing and the old world may seem swampy or stale. \n\nThe third eye on the other hand is associated with seeing in the most literal sense \"astral planes\" and their features and creatues, and even to those to whom it happened it's usually a temporary fleeting state and then it close and you are back again here on Earth.\n\n## Comment ID kqcq4g1 with +5 score by [(MindofMine11, Reddit, 2024-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqcq4g1/) (in reply to ID 1aqcn4y):\nThe deeper i dive in, the  less i want to be part of this materialistic world full of delusions.\n\n## Comment ID kqeanpt with +5 score by [(kaizenkitten, Reddit, 2024-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqeanpt/) (in reply to ID 1aqcn4y):\nNot mine, but a friend of mine did, and I wish it hadn't.

Conforming to social expectations, working a job that \"seems\" prestigious, successful. With yoga practice now you have more self awareness. Realizing all the things you believed you wanted are just what the environment told you, not necessarily your true desire. You're less driven by the ego. You dissolved the identities you attached yourself to. A husband, a provider, a successful worker. But after the letting go you haven't constructed a life based on this new awareness. It is confusing. This is time to be still. If you are able to not start another job so soon, take time to meditate and be in nature. Go explore. What is your Dharma? What is your heart felt desire?

      "# [Avocado Oils Tested for Phthalates — Buying Guide by Leah Segedie on 2024-08-06](https://www.mamavation.com/food/avocado-oils-tested-for-phthalates-buying-guide.html)\nWhich avocado oils have the least toxic phthalate contamination? Phthalates are hormone-disrupting chemicals in plastics & fragrances that find their way into many foods and personal care products. To solve this puzzle, Mamavation sent several of the most popular avocado oils off to an EPA-certified laboratory to test for several types of phthalates to find out. You’ve trusted Mamavation to cover topics like safest olive oils tested for phthalates, safest coconut oils tested for phthalates, safest salt sans heavy metals and microplastics, safest cookware without PFAS “forever chemicals” and nanoparticles, and safest water purifiers that filter PFAS, now join us for another consumer study on avocado oils and hormone-disrupting phthalates.\n\nDisclosure: This consumer study is released in partnership with Environmental Health News. Scientific reviews were performed by (1) Terrence Collins, Teresa Heinz Professor of Green Chemistry & Director of the Institute for Green Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University, (2) Linda S. Birnbaum, Scientist Emeritus and Former Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and National Toxicology Program & Scholar in Residence at Duke University, Adjunct Professor at the University of North Carolina, & Yale University, & (3) Pete Myers, Chief Scientist at Environmental Health Sciences, Adjunct Professor of Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University, and Co-Author of Our Stolen Future.

Copyright © 2024 Mamavation — All Rights Reserved\n\nPhthalates Found in Popular Avocado Oils\n\nMamavation’s EPA-certified laboratory found phthalates in 11 popular avocado oils. These chemicals are linked to serious health effects, which we will discuss later. Because phthalates are so problematic to hormones, Mamavation has commissioned our own scientific studies on phthalates in food products to make recommendations for the safest avocado oils. Continue reading Mamavation’s article on these products to find which brands have the lowest amounts of phthalates according to our laboratory.\n\nFor this consumer study, Mamavation sent 11 popular avocado oils from 11 brands to an EPA-certified laboratory looking for phthalates. Because Mamavation only tested one product per brand, we cannot claim to know if these issues are, in fact, industry-wide or portfolio-wide. However, based on our “spot-check” of the industry, this is what we found:\n\n100% of avocado oils analyzed by our laboratory had traces of phthalates. This is a total of 11 detections from 11 avocado oil products.\n\nRanges of phthalates were from 76 parts per billion (ppb) to 56,808 ppb. Based on the amounts presented, we created 4 categories to communicate levels of phthalates found: (1) Avocado oils with the most contamination (2) Avocado oils with still very high contamination, (3) Avocado oils with intermediate contamination, & (4) Avocado Oils with the least contamination. These categories are not based on health impacts. They are based on presenting data and where the middle ground lies in each category. We then added 2 results from Defend Our Health’s study on phthalates to give our audience more variety in choices.\n\n9% of Avocado oil products had over 20,000 ppb phthalates. That’s 1 bottle out of 11 avocado oils. We dubbed this the “Are You Kidding Me?” realm, which would have the highest amount of phthalates.\n\n18% of Avocado oil products had between 2,000 ppb and 20,000 phthalates. That’s 2 out of 11 bottles of avocado oils over 2,000 ppb. We dubbed this the “Not Our Favorite Avocado Oils with High Contamination” realm.\n\n27% of avocado oil products had between 800 ppb and 2,000 ppb phthalates. That’s 3 out of 11 bottles of avocado oil between 800 ppb and 2,000 ppb. We dubbed this the “Better Avocado Oils with Intermediate Contamination” realm.\n\n45% of avocado oil products had less than 800 ppb phthalates. That’s 5 out of 11 bottles of avocado oil that had below 800 ppb. We dubbed this the “Best Avocado Oils with Least Contamination” realm.\n\nIf you are using avocado oil to prepare meals for your family or as personal care, this investigation will be very important to follow to reduce your family’s exposure to phthalates. However, as you can see, every avocado oil manufacturer whose products Mamavation studied has work to do to remove phthalates from their products. None of the avocado oils that were tested by Mamavation or by Defend Our Health had zero detections of phthalates.\n\nPhthalates are typically found inside plastics and in undisclosed fragrances. When in plastics, they work to make the plastic more flexible. When they are in fragrances, they help carry the scent longer in the air. These chemical contaminants are found in many types of products that are involved in the food service industry like food service gloves, tubing used in dairy operations, hoses, holding tanks, and conveyor belts inside manufacturing plants. In fact, there are so many places where phthalates can show up because they are legal indirect food additives used in manufacturing for both conventional AND organic foods. There is some movement to restrict some ortho-phthalate chemicals from food packaging but not from manufacturing in general.\n\nLinda S. Birnbaum, Scientist Emeritus and Former Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and National Toxicology Program & Scholar in Residence at Duke University, Adjunct Professor at the University of North Carolina & at Yale University had this to say about the study after her review: “Phthalates cause multiple adverse health effects, including developmental effects in the reproductive system and neurotoxicity. There is also evidence for causing cancer in laboratory animals.”\n\nTypes of Phthalates Found in Our Avocado Oil Study\n\nOur laboratory found five different types of phthalates in the coconut oil we sent to them. Here’s a brief breakdown of each one.\n\nDi-2-ethylhexyl Phthalate (DEHP): DEHP is a highly toxic endocrine disruptor. It was also the most common phthalate found by our lab and is found commonly in building products (wallpaper, wire, and cable insulation), clothing (footwear, raincoats), car products, food packaging, medical devices, and children’s products (toys, grip bumpers). This chemical is also on California’s Prop. 65 list of carcinogens and reproductive toxicants. In addition, it’s been linked to endocrine disruption, reproductive issues, developmental issues, liver & kidney toxicity, asthma & allergies, & thyroid problems.\n\nDiisodecyl phthalate (DIDP): Found commonly in PVC plastics, artificial leather, toys, carpet backing, covering on wires and cables, and pool liners. This chemical is also on California’s Prop. 65 list of carcinogens and reproductive toxicants. It’s associated with health concerns including liver & kidney toxicity, developmental issues, endocrine disruption, reproductive issues, asthma & allergies, & thyroid problems.\n\nBis(2-propylheptyl) Phthalate (DPHP): This type of phthalate is a substitute for other high molecular weight phthalates used primarily for high-temperature applications such as cable wires, roofing membranes, and food containers. It is used to soften plastics and is a general-use plasticizer under investigation as an endocrine disruptor. This phthalate is associated with additional health concerns like reproductive toxicity, prenatal, perinatal, & post-natal toxicity, and genotoxicity.\n\nDi-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP): This type of phthalate is a colorless, odorless, oily liquid that doesn’t evaporate easily used to keep plastics soft or more flexible. It is used for medical tubing and blood storage bags, wire and cables, carpetback coating, floor tile, adhesives, cosmetics, and pesticides. Animal studies have demonstrated increased fetal malformations and reduced body weights of offspring. DnOP comprises about 20% of commercial C6-10 phthalate mixtures used in flooring and carpet tiles, tarps, pool liners, and garden hoses. DnOP is approved by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) as an indirect food additive which is typically used in manufacturing as seam cements, bottle cap liners, and conveyor belts. DNOP are classified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as priority environmental pollutants.\n\nDibutyl phthalate (DBP): This type of phthalate is an organic compound commonly used as a plasticizer, and as an additive to\n\nadhesives or printing inks. It usually is a colorless oil, but can have a yellow color. Use of this substance in cosmetics, such as in nail polishes, is banned in the European Union. DBP is one of the six phthalic acid esters found on the Priority Pollutant List regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Animal studies have observed that DBP is toxic to fetal development. This phthalate is associated with additional health concerns like reproductive toxicity, prenatal, perinatal, & post-natal toxicity, and genotoxicity.\n\nDiisononyl phthalate (DINP): This type of phthalate is used as a plasticizer. The European Union has set restrictions on this chemical inside food contact materials because of the determination that it’s problematic to human health. DINP is also listed on the California Prop. 65 list of carcinogens and reproductive toxicants.\n\nAdditional Studies Finding Phthalates in Cooking Oils\n\nAnother scientific report co-authored by our friends at Defend Our Health published in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology found phthalates in a range of popular children’s foods and organic products in 2023. Included in this report were 2 avocado oils.\n\nMamavation took the results from this report and added it to our list of recommendations at the bottom of this post for your review, which was two additional results. However, all coconut oils, olive oils, & avocado oils tested by Defend Our Health also had trace amounts of phthalates. It’s not so much a question of whether there are phthalates present in coconut oils, olive oils, & avocado oils. It’s a matter of what levels are present. Both of our studies confirmed that these cooking oils have different levels of phthalates present.\n\nView our consumer study on olive oils here.\n\nView our consumer study on coconut oils here.\n\nPhthalates Have Specific Problematic Health Effects\n\nPhthalates are linked to many health effects from several studies on both animals and humans. This is very problematic because phthalates are linked with hormone disruption of the endocrine system, which regulates the body’s hormones, even in trace amounts in low concentrations. Epidemiological studies have revealed that exposure to phthalates adversely affects the level of hormones within the body, which can impact several important health functions. Here are some health effects phthalate exposure is linked to.\n\nWeight gain & obesity\n\nShorter height\n\nPrecocious puberty\n\nAsthma\n\nAllergies\n\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\n\nLower IQ\n\nSocial impairment\n\nType II diabetes and insulin resistance\n\nPoor cardiovascular health\n\nThyroid function and increased risk of thyroid cancer\n\nFemales: pregnancy loss and preterm birth, low birth weight, earlier menopause\n\nMales: genital development, semen quality, reduced “masculine” play, Inhibits testosterone production, Shortened anogenital distance, or shortened “taint” , Shortened length of penis\n\nTerrence Collins, Teresa Heinz Professor of Green Chemistry & Director of the Institute for Green Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University had this to say about the study during his scientific review: “An earlier Mamavation study found that olive oils are contaminated with phthalates. Now Mamavation is finding phthalates in avocado oils. Phthalates are anti-androgens—they disrupt male hormone action. Currently, highly chemicalized countries like America are experiencing a steady drop in male fertility, quantified through a population-level decline in mean sperm count and quality. Phthalate exposures are suspected of playing a role in the declines. Phthalate contamination of food oils is completely unacceptable! Like the olive oil manufacturers, the avocado oil manufacturers should begin acting to better protect their customers by thoroughly examining every aspect of their supply and manufacturing chains to ensure that all phthalates are eliminated. And then they should learn much more about endocrine disruption and become extremely diligent in producing products that are free of endocrine-disrupting chemicals. One has to wonder why the FDA appears to be asleep on the job.”\n\nHow are Phthalates Regulated in the Food Supply & Children’s Products?\n\nBecause phthalates are so problematic to human health, there are varying restrictions on products and food at the federal level. There is, however, no consistency among federal agencies to protect the public. For instance, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) restricts certain phthalates within children’s toys and childcare products. They prohibit the import and sale of those products that contain more than 0.1% of the following phthalates:\n\ndi-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)\n\ndibutyl phthalate (DBP)\n\nbenzyl butyl phthalate (BBP)\n\ndiisononyl phthalate (DINP)\n\ndiisobutyl phthalate (DIBP)\n\ndi-n-pentyl phthalate (DPENP)\n\ndi-n-hexyl phthalate (DHEXP)\n\ndicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP)\n\nEven though the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission restricted 8 ortho-phthalates in products intended for use by children, you still see some of the same chemicals approved as indirect additives by the FDA in the food supply even when those foods are marketed to children. Furthermore, the FDA denied a citizen petition in 2022 which demanded to take these phthalate chemicals out of the food supply because they impact the hormones of children.\n\nCalifornia also has some restrictions under the Prop. 65 list of Carcinogens and Reproductive Toxicants, requiring products sold over the limits to be accompanied by a warning. Any consumer living in California who tests and finds products with specific phthalate amounts outside the limits may bring a Prop. 65 lawsuit six months after serving the company with a public notification letter. However, be advised these limits are not enforceable. California’s “right to know” law is only about warning the consumer about the carcinogenic chemicals present. Therefore, California cannot force companies to recall products that are above these limits. Here are the phthalate-criteria:\n\nBBP – Maximum Allowable Dose Levels (MADL) 1,200 μg/day (oral)\n\nDBP – MADL 8.7 μg/day\n\nDIDP – MADL 2,200 μg/day\n\nDnHP – MADL 2,200 μg/day\n\nDEHP – No Significant Risk Level (NSRL) 310 μg/day (adult), MADL 4,200 μg/day (intravenous adult), MADL 600 (intravenous infant), MADL 410 ug/day (oral for adult), MADL 58 ug/day (oral for infant).\n\nDINP – NSRL 146 μg/day\n\nIn terms of avocado oils, it could be possible that the vast majority of phthalates are finding their way into the product during manufacturing, storage, or transportation. Under the Food & Drug Administration 21 CFR rules, FDA regulates food, drugs, cosmetics, and food contact materials within the United States. The FDA sanctioned the use of 25 plasticizers via an amendment to food additive regulations: 21 CFR Part 175 through 21 CFR Part 178. These regulations allow the use of phthalates in the food supply as “indirect food additives” that can be present. These chemicals can find their way into your food in many ways during manufacturing such as:\n\nAdhesives and components of coatings used in food contact materials.\n\nComponents of paper and paperboard, such as paperboard that is in contact with aqueous and fatty foods or used as a defoaming agent on the paperboard.\n\nAdjuvants, production aids, and sanitizers used in manufacturing.\n\nPlasticizers in polymeric substances, such as phthalates in plastic PVA or PVC sheets in food contact materials OR vinyl chloride homopolymers or copolymers used in food contact materials.\n\nSurface lubricants used to make metallic products.\n\nThe European Union has banned or restricted several phthalates such as DEHP, DBP, DIBP, and BBP in a wide range of products since 2020. These bans and restrictions include children’s swimming aids, flooring, coated fabrics and paper, recreational gear, mattresses, footwear, and office supplies, among other categories. These chemicals are not expected to be found in foods above certain thresholds. However, not all phthalates are restricted or tested for either.\n\nOther Categories of Products Mamavation Has Tested for Toxic Contaminants\n\nBefore we launch into the raw data from our lab, we wanted to remind you about all the other studies we have done on indications of PFAS “forever chemicals,” pesticides, & heavy metals inside the food and consumer products you may bring inside your home. Each one of these studies were done in a similar fashion as this study with brands sent independently to the certified lab and raw data of those labs at the bottom of the post.\n\nSoft Contact Lenses\n\nGreen Beauty Makeup\n\nLip Balm\n\nCondoms & Lubricants\n\nDental Floss\n\nToilet Paper\n\nTissue Paper\n\nPeriod Underwear\n\nTampons\n\nSanitary Pads, Pantiliners, & Incontinence Pads\n\nPowdered Electrolytes\n\nCinnamon\n\nSalt\n\nButter Wrappers\n\nPasta & Tomato Sauces\n\nNut Butters (Peanut butter, etc.)\n\nCoffee\n\nOlive oils\n\nCoconut oils\n\nKetchup\n\nActivewear (Yoga Pants)\n\nSports Bras\n\nParchment Paper\n\nCupcake Liners\n\nPlastic-Free Straws\n\nSandwich Baggies (Both plastic & more “sustainable” options)\n\nFast Food Packaging\n\nFurniture\n\nChildren’s Probiotics\n\nKids’ Backpacks\n\nBaby Strollers\n\nBaby Bottles\n\nMamavation’s Investigation of Avocado Oils & Phthalates\n\nFor this study, avocado oils were purchased between February 2023 and May 2024. Each product was recorded in our database and sent directly to the lab within its original packaging. Unfortunately, 100% of avocado oils tested had at least trace amounts of ortho-phthalates, a class of hormone-disrupting chemicals.\n\nTo make this a more comprehensive list, we have combined our raw data with raw data from the study done in 2023 by Defend Our Health. As you can see, the purpose behind this consumer study is designed to help you select a food product with lower amounts of phthalates.\n\nMamavation’s EPA-certified lab tested for the following phthalates. This is not a complete list of all the phthalates that are allowed to be present as an indirect food additive according to the FDA, however, this list goes above and beyond what is already restricted by the European Union or the State of California and mirrors what was tested in 2023 by Defend Our Health.\n\nDiethyl phthalate (DEP)\n\nDi-n-propyl phthalate (DPP)\n\nDiisobutyl phthalate (DIBP)\n\nDibutyl phthalate (DBP)\n\nDihexyl phthalate (DnHP)\n\nBenzyl butyl phthalate (BBP)\n\nDicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP)\n\nDiisononyl phthalate (DINP)\n\nDi-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP)\n\nDiisodecyl phthalate (DIDP)\n\nbis(2-Ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)\n\nDimethyl phthalate (DMP)\n\nBis(2-propylheptyl) Phthalate (DPHP)\n\nDidecyl phthalate (DDP)\n\nPete Myers, Chief Scientist at Environmental Health Sciences, Adjunct Professor of Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University, and Co-Author of Our Stolen Future had this to say: “The presence of individual types of phthalates in avocado oils is just a starting point. Scientific experts in endocrine disruption are deeply concerned about the simultaneous effect of the mixtures of phthalates present. In our samples, 91% tested had at least two phthalate types present, and 64% had at least three phthalates present. That’s not a good sign.”\n\nMamavation’s Raw Data on Phthalates in Avocado Oil\n\nAre You Kidding Me? Avocado Oil(s) with the Most Contamination\n\nThis category contains avocado oils sent to our EPA-certified laboratory and found to have phthalate sum levels over 20,000 ppb.\n\nMadhava Clean & Simple Avocado Oil — Total phthalate 56,808 ppb\n\nNot Our Favorite Avocado Oils with High Contamination\n\nThis category contains avocado oils sent to our EPA-certified laboratory and found to have phthalate sum levels between 2,000 ppb and 20,000 ppb.

      "# [Jainism - Mahavira, Parshvanatha, Rishabhanatha by G. Ralph Strohl, Umakant Premanand Shah on 1998-07-20](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Jainism/Important-figures-of-Jain-legend)\nDoctrines of Jainism\n\nEven though Jain doctrine holds that no one can achieve liberation in this corrupt time, the Jain religious goal is the complete perfection and purification of the soul. This, they believe, occurs only when the soul is in a state of eternal liberation (moksha) from corporeal bodies. Liberation of the soul is impeded by the accumulation of karmas—bits of material, generated by a person’s actions, that attach themselves to the soul and consequently bind it to physical bodies through many births. This has the effect of thwarting the full self-realization and freedom of the soul. As a result, Jain renunciants do not seek immediate enlightenment; instead, through disciplined and meritorious practice of nonviolence, they pursue a human rebirth that will bring them nearer to that state. To understand how the Jains address this problem, it is first necessary to consider the Jain conception of reality.\n\nTime and the universe\n\nTime, according to the Jains, is eternal and formless. It is understood as a wheel with 12 spokes (ara), the equivalent of ages, six of which form an ascending arc and six a descending one. In the ascending arc (utsarpini) humans progress in knowledge, age, stature, and happiness, while in the descending arc (avasarpini) they deteriorate. The two cycles joined together make one rotation of the wheel of time, which is called a kalpa. These kalpas repeat themselves without beginning or end.\n\nThe Jain world is eternal and uncreated. Its constituent elements, the five basics of reality (astikayas), are soul, matter, space, the principles of motion, and the arrest of motion; for the Digambaras there is a sixth substance, time. These elements are eternal and indestructible, but their conditions change constantly, manifesting three characteristics: arising, stability, and falling away. On this basis, Jainism claims to provide a more realistic analysis of the world and its complexities than Hinduism or Buddhism.\n\nJains divide the inhabited universe into five parts. The lower world (adholoka) is subdivided into seven tiers of hells, each one darker and more painful than the one above it. The middle world (madhyaloka) comprises a vast number of concentric continents separated by seas. At the centre is the continent of Jambudvipa. Human beings occupy Jambudvipa, the second continent contiguous to it, and half of the third. The focus of Jain activity, however, is Jambudvipa, the only continent on which it is possible for the soul to achieve liberation. The celestial world (urdhvaloka) consists of two categories of heaven: one for the souls of those who may or may not have entered the Jain path and another for those who are far along on the path, close to their emancipation. At the apex of the occupied universe is the siddhashila, the crescent-shaped abode of liberated souls (siddhas). Finally, there are some areas inhabited solely by ekendriyas, single-sense organisms that permeate the occupied universe.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nWorld Religions & Traditions\n\nJiva and ajiva\n\nJain reality comprises two components, jiva (“soul,” or “living substance”) and ajiva (“nonsoul,” or “inanimate substance”). Ajiva is further divided into two categories: nonsentient material entities and nonsentient nonmaterial entities.\n\nThe essential characteristics of jiva are consciousness (chetana), bliss (sukha), and energy (virya). In its pure state, jiva possesses these qualities limitlessly. The souls, infinite in number, are divisible in their embodied state into two main classes, immobile and mobile, according to the number of sense organs possessed by the body they inhabit. The first group consists of souls inhabiting immeasurably small particles of earth, water, fire, and air, along with the vegetable kingdom, which possess only the sense of touch. The second group comprises souls that inhabit bodies that have between two and five sense organs. Moreover, the universe is populated with an infinite number of minute beings, nigodas, some of which are slowly evolving while the rest have no chance of emerging from their hapless state.\n\nFormless and genderless, jiva cannot be directly perceived by the senses. Like the universe, it is without a point of ultimate origin or end. While not all-pervasive, it can, by contraction or expansion, occupy various amounts of space. Like the light of a lamp in a small or a large room, jiva can fill both the smaller and the larger bodies it occupies. The soul assumes the exact dimensions of the body it occupies, but it is not identical with that body. On death it assumes the shape of the last physical body that housed it.\n\nMatter (pudgala) has the characteristics of touch, taste, smell, and colour; however, its essential characteristic is lack of consciousness. The smallest unit of matter is the atom (paramanu). Heat, light, and shade are all forms of fine matter.\n\nThe nonsentient nonmaterial substances are space, time, and the principles of motion and its arrest. They are always pure and are not subject to defilement. The principles of motion and its arrest permeate the universe; they do not exist independently but rather form a necessary precondition for any object’s movement or coming to rest.\n\nKarma\n\nThe fundamental tenet of Jain doctrine is that all phenomena are linked in a universal chain of cause and effect. Every event has a definite cause. By nature each soul is pure, possessing infinite knowledge, bliss, and power; however, these faculties are restricted throughout time by the soul’s contact with matter. This matter, which produces the chain of cause and effect, of birth and death, is karma, an atomic substance and not a process, as it is in Hinduism and Buddhism. To be free from the shackles of karma, a person must stop the influx of new karmas and eliminate the acquired ones.\n\nKarmic particles are acquired as the result of intentional “passionate” action, though the very earliest Jain teachings on this subject claimed that any action, even if unintentional, attracted karma. Acquired karmas can be annihilated through a process called nirjara (“wearing away”), which includes fasting, restricting diet, controlling taste, retreating to lonely places, along with mortifications of the body, atonement and expiation for sins, modesty, service, study, meditation, and renunciation of the ego. Nirjara is, thus, the calculated cessation of passionate action.\n\nBecause of karma a soul is imprisoned in a succession of bodies and passes through various stages of spiritual development before becoming free from all karmic bondage. These stages of development (gunasthanas) involve progressive manifestations of the innate faculties of knowledge and power and are accompanied by decreasing sinfulness and increasing purity.\n\nTheories of knowledge as applied to liberation\n\nIn Jain thought, four stages of perception—observation, will to recognize, determination, and impression—lead to subjective cognition (matijnana), the first of five kinds of knowledge (jnana). The second kind, shrutajnana, derives from the scriptures and general information. Both are mediated cognition, based on external conditions perceived by the senses. In addition there are three kinds of immediate knowledge—avadhi (supersensory perception), manahparyaya (reading the thoughts of others), and kevala (omniscience). Kevala is necessarily accompanied by freedom from karmic obstruction and by direct experience of the soul’s pure form unblemished by attachment to matter. Omniscience, the foremost attribute of a liberated jiva, is the emblem of its purity; thus, a liberated soul, such as a Tirthankara, is called a kevalin (“possessor of omniscience”). However, not all kevalins are Tirthankaras: becoming a Tirthankara requires the development of a particular type of karmic destiny.\n\nFor the Jains all knowledge short of omniscience is flawed. Because reality is characterized by arising, change, and decay, as opposed to simple permanence (for the Hindus) and impermanence (for the Buddhists), the Jains developed an epistemological system based on seven perspectives (naya). This system, anekantavada, “the many-pointed doctrine,” takes into account the provisional nature of mundane knowledge. To gain some approximation to reality, a judgment must ideally be framed in accord with all seven perspectives.\n\nAccording to Jainism, yoga, the ascetic physical and meditative discipline of the monk, is the means to attain omniscience and thus liberation (moksha). Yoga is the cultivation of true knowledge of reality, faith in the teachings of the Tirthankaras, and pure conduct; it is thus intimately connected to the Three Jewels (ratnatraya) of right knowledge, right faith, and right practice (respectively, samyagjnana, samyagdarshana, and samyakcharitra).\n\nJain ethics\n\nThe Three Jewels constitute the basis of the Jain doctrinal and ethical stance. Right knowledge, faith, and practice must be cultivated together because none of them can be achieved in the absence of the others. Right faith leads to calmness or tranquility, detachment, kindness, and the renunciation of pride of birth, beauty of form, wealth, scholarship, prowess, and fame. Right faith leads to perfection only when followed by right practice. Yet, there can be no virtuous conduct without right knowledge, the clear distinction between the self and the nonself. Knowledge without faith and conduct is futile. Without purification of mind, all austerities are mere bodily torture. Right practice is thus spontaneous, not a forced mechanical quality. Attainment of right practice is a gradual process, and a layperson can observe only partial self-control; a renunciant, however, is able to observe more comprehensive rules of conduct.\n\nTwo separate courses of conduct are laid down for the ascetics and the laity. In both cases the code of morals is based on the doctrine of nonviolence (ahimsa). Because thought gives rise to action, violence in thought merely precedes violent behaviour.\n\nViolence in thought, then, is the greater and subtler form of violence because it arises from ideas of attachment and aversion, grounded in passionate states, which result from negligence or lack of care in behaviour. Jainism enjoins avoidance of all forms of injury—whether committed by body, mind, or speech—and subscribes emphatically to the teaching that “nonviolence is the highest form of religious practice.” For Jains, this principle, which manifests itself most obviously in the form of vegetarianism, is the single most important component of their tradition’s message. Notable in this connection is the friendship between the Jain layman Raychandrabhai Mehta and Mohandas Gandhi, who considered his interactions with Mehta to have been important in formulating his own ideas on the use of nonviolence as a political tactic.",

Whether you’re drizzling it over your salad, sautéing your veggies, or pretending to be fancy while cooking scrambled eggs, avocado oil has found a way to sneak into our kitchens and hearts. To help you find the best avocado oils, StudyFinds visited 10 expert websites and put together this list of the most-recommended products across these sites. As always, leave your recommendations of your favorite avocado oils in the comments below!\n\nStudyFinds is a research-driven platform that analyzes and synthesizes expert recommendations from trusted sources. Rather than writing reviews ourselves, we meticulously compile consensus findings from leading industry experts and established publications to save consumers valuable research time. Each article represents hours of analysis across multiple authoritative sources to identify the most consistently recommended choices.\n\n1. Chosen Foods 100% Pure Avocado Oil\n\nAvocado oil can sometimes have a strong, distinct flavor that isn’t always desired in a recipe, but Chosen Foods is used to preparing avocados in a unique way that provides the best quality product for their consumers.\n\n“Chosen Foods built its entire brand around harnessing the power of avocados, so it’s no wonder its 100% Pure Avocado Oil earned the spot of best overall. It’s non-GMO, expeller-pressed, and naturally refined, to give you a neutral taste without any additives,” The Spruce Eats writes. “Chosen Foods’ avocados, which come from Mexico are never sprayed with any pesticides and are irrigated only with rainwater.”\n\nExperts also like that it comes in a sprayable version. “Meal preparation becomes much easier and more accessible with aerosol. Besides, choosing an essential oil spray is not only convenient but also good for your health. Since this is pressed and naturally refined without the use of chemicals, you can count on it,” says Lacademie in their review.\n\nIt’s such high-quality that you can even use it to reach your skincare and beauty goals. “Made from Hass avocados, it can be used in cooking, salads and your beauty routine,” adds Chef’s Pencil.\n\n2. La Tourangelle Avocado Oil\n\nLa Tourangelle is known for having several lines of top-notch oils that make a perfect addition to your kitchen, and their avocado oil is surely included. “The mainstay of all La Tourangelle’s natural, artisanal oils is premium taste derived from the best quality ingredients. Add the flavor of La Tourangelle to any meal,” Find This Best writes.\n\nLacademie praises its health benefits for using with cooking or as a haircare or skincare product. “La Tourangelle oil is 100% hand-crafted from premium California avocados. It is also Project Non-GMO and certified as gluten-free.”\n\nAvocado oil can sometimes come with a steep price tag, but not this one! “This oil brings the best for the buck. 250 ml of oil is extracted from about 20 avocados, making this oil dense and with a potent aroma, but quite the pleasant flavor. And it’s affordable,” Chef’s Pencil writes.\n\n3. Avohass Avocado Oil\n\nAlthough this oil is the prime example of one that comes with a significant price tag, it’s one of the only oils that is actually cold pressed. “Avohass avocado oil is one of the only truly cold-pressed avocado oils on the market. The oil is extracted from the best unbruised grade-A California avocados at their peak ripeness, without the use of any heat or chemicals. Also, the oil is extra-virgin and organic-certified, which means it’s really one of the highest-quality oils you can get,” The Spruce Eats writes.\n\nFind This Best describes this product as, “vibrant green in color with a slightly nutty, rich, and buttery avocado flavor.”\n\nThis oil is also unrefined, meaning that the smoke point is a little bit lower at 400 degrees Fahrenheit and may not be the best for frying. However, it doesn’t fall short at all for just about anything else. “It’s still a suitable option for most types of cooking, such as sautéing, stir-frying, and roasting,” The Spruce Eats adds.\n\n4. Primal Kitchen Extra Virgin Avocado Oil\n\nPrimal Kitchen is a popular brand that is dedicated to their mission of making sure healthy fats are part of their condiments, sauces, and other kitchen staples. Their extra virgin avocado oil is derived from Spanish avocados and works best as a cold addition to your meals.\n\n“It’s best for cold dishes, like as part of a dressing for salads or a finishing oil for roasted vegetables but, you can also use it for medium- to low-heat cooking,” The Spruce Eats writes.\n\nBecause this product has a smoke point of up to 520ºF, you can comfortably use it for all your high-temperature cooking ideas,” Lacademie adds. “Not only that, you will love the glass packaging of Primal Kitchen. This material excellently preserves all the flavors after opening.”\n\nSeveral products from Primal Kitchen are go-to options among low-carb folks, and their avocado oil is certified to meet these dietary restrictions as well. “This oil is approved and certified by Whole 30 and Paleo diets and is also ideal for the Keto diet,” LA Times writes.\n\n5. Kevala Avocado Oil\n\nIf you’re looking for a bulk option that’s affordable and can be used in various ways, Kevala is the option for you. “Kevala Avocado Oil is best for people seeking a large quantity that they can use for the long term. This oil is produced through cold-pressing, making it a pure, nutritious, and chemical-free product,” LA Times writes.\n\nChef’s Pencil adds: “It has a mild taste and aroma and consumers find it ideal, since it’s not too overwhelming. If you’re just turning to avo oil, start with this one!”\n\nAs is the case for all of the oils listed, Kevala is beloved by many for its versatility, but is recommended for specific foods too!\n\n“Kevala oil can deal with any dish thanks to its impressive high smoke point up to 500ºF. It can even show up as one of the chosen oils to make popcorn. Or you can make home mayo with this product,” Lacademie writes.\n\nSources used to create this consensus list\n\nThe Spruce Eats\n\nLacademie\n\nChef’s Pencil\n\nFind This Best\n\nLA Times\n\nBest Reviews\n\nMSN\n\nSimply Recipes\n\nSure Keto\n\nBest Reviews UK\n\nNote: This article was not paid for nor sponsored.

      "# [Mahavir Jayanti: Embracing the teachings of the enlightened one by Arijit Roy on 2024-04-04](https://apeejay.news/mahavir-jayanti-embracing-the-teachings-of-the-enlightened-one/)\nMahavir Jayanti commemorates the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir, the 24th and last Tirthankara of Jainism, whose teachings continue to inspire millions around the world. As we celebrate this auspicious occasion, let’s delve into the life of Mahavir Jain and explore three timeless values that students can imbibe from his divine wisdom.\n\nThe Life of Mahavir Jain\n\nLord Mahavir was born as Vardhamana Mahavira in 599 BCE in Kundagrama, Bihar, India. Renouncing his princely life at the age of 30, he embarked on a spiritual quest for enlightenment. Through rigorous meditation, asceticism, and unwavering devotion, Mahavir attained Kevala Jnana (omniscience) and became a revered spiritual leader. His teachings emphasised non-violence (ahimsa), truthfulness (satya), compassion (karuna), and self-discipline (tapas), inspiring followers to lead a life of righteousness and moral integrity.\n\nAhimsa (Non-Violence)\n\nAhimsa, or non-violence, lies at the core of Mahavir’s teachings and is a fundamental principle of Jainism. Students can emulate this value by cultivating compassion and empathy towards all living beings, fostering a culture of peace and harmony in their interactions. By practicing non-violence in thought, speech, and action, students can contribute to a more compassionate and inclusive society, where differences are respected, and conflicts are resolved through dialogue and understanding.\n\nSatya (Truthfulness)\n\nTruthfulness, or satya, is another cornerstone of Mahavir’s philosophy, emphasising the importance of honesty and integrity in all aspects of life. Students can embody this value by speaking the truth, upholding ethical standards, and being sincere in their words and actions. By cultivating a commitment to truthfulness, students can build trust and credibility in their relationships, fostering a culture of transparency and accountability in their academic and personal endeavors.\n\nKaruna (Compassion)\n\nCompassion, or karuna, lies at the heart of Mahavir’s teachings, urging individuals to extend kindness and empathy towards all sentient beings. Students can cultivate this value by practicing acts of kindness, empathy, and service towards others, fostering a culture of care and support within their communities. By embracing compassion as a guiding principle, students can create a more inclusive and empathetic society, where everyone feels valued, understood, and supported in their journey of growth and self-discovery.\n\nAn inspiration for all mankind!\n\nAs we celebrate Mahavir Jayanti, let us draw inspiration from the life and teachings of Lord Mahavir, embodying the timeless values of ahimsa, satya, and karuna in our daily lives. By cultivating non-violence, truthfulness, and compassion, students can contribute to a more harmonious and compassionate world, where peace, integrity, and empathy reign supreme. As we reflect on the profound wisdom of Lord Mahavir, let us strive to emulate his virtues, walking the path of righteousness and enlightenment with humility, grace, and unwavering devotion.\n\nSenior Correspondent at the Apeejay Newsroom, Arijit has written more than a thousand articles across varied genres and also shot video interviews and live coverages with the highest viewership, displaying his versatility and skill.
