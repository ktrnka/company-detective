      "# [About Us by – Todd Owens on 2025-02-14](https://www.kevala.care/about)\nA healthcare crisis and\n\na call to action\n\nSchedules taped to walls. Endless logins to software no one wants to use. Shrinking teams stretched thin by burnout, and soaring costs. In 2020, COVID-19 blew the lid off a long-simmering crisis: overburdened caregivers, a vulnerable aging population, and a workforce struggling to keep up. For co-founders Todd Owens, Patrick Lawler, and Noah Kusz, it was a call to action. As hospitals scrambled to fill shifts, they realized the problem wasn’t just a lack of staff—it was the lack of tools to manage them effectively.\n\nHealthcare needed a platform built with its unique challenges in mind—not a generic solution retrofitted from other industries. Kevala’s mission was clear: to build tech that people actually want to use, empowering teams to deliver better care without sacrificing their own well-being.\n\nWe don’t just fill schedules we solve problems\n\nOur approach? Simple: We don’t just fill schedules. We solve problems. Our intelligent platform brings every workforce type—full-time, part-time, float, and agency—into a seamless team. It learns, adapts, and works for you, accounting for qualifications, preferences, and patient needs. The result? Less burnout, better outcomes, and a system that runs the way it should.\n\nAt Kevala, we’re not here to tweak the status quo. We’re here to disrupt it. Because healthcare deserves more than spreadsheets and outdated tools. It deserves technology that elevates care, saves precious resources, and empowers action.\n\nStep into the future with us. Let’s rebuild healthcare workforce management—smarter, stronger, and centered on the people who make care possible.",

      "# [Privacy Policy](https://www.kevala.care/privacy-policy)\nKevala's Privacy Policy is periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. This Privacy Policy may change as Kevala updates and expands the Kevala Platform. Kevala will work to notify you of any material changes by email. Kevala also encourages you to review this Privacy Policy thoroughly and periodically.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThank you for choosing to be a part of the Kevala community. When you use our services, you are trusting us with your information and we’re here to ensure that your information is protected. This Privacy Policy is meant for you to understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can manage and update your information.\n\n‍\n\nBefore we get started with the details, here are a few terms we think you should know as you read this policy.\n\n‍\n\nIn this Privacy Policy, Kevala Technologies, Inc. may be referred to as \"Kevala,\" “we,” “our,” or “us.”\n\n‍\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies to personal information and other information collected by Kevala or its service providers from or about “You” (or “Your”) and you may be:\n\na visitor to, or user of, our Site without a Kevala account;\n\na visitor to, or user of, our Site with a Kevala account; referred to as “Employee” and can be an “Employee” of Kevala, or an “Organization”\n\na current customer using the Services pursuant to a written agreement with Kevala referred to as “Organization” (or “Client,” “Agency,” or “Employer”)\n\na prospective and current customer using the Services pursuant to a clickwrap, browser wrap, or other online agreement;\n\na service provider or business partner; or\n\nanother third-party that uses the Services, including without limitation the end users of prospective or current customers.\n\n“Data Protection Laws” refers to the laws that are designed to protect your personal data and privacy in the place where you live. This includes: (1) the “GDPR”, the European Data Protection Law which stands for “General Data Protection Regulation”, with the official name Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council; (2) “PIPEDA” (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), which is the Canadian Data Protection Law that applies to our activities in Canada; and (3) the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) which applies to our activities in the United States. Kevala is committed to adhering to all these applicable Data Protection laws.\n\n‍\n\n“Personal data” – this is information we collect from you or about you and which is defined in the GDPR as “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” It can be as simple as your name or your email, or something more complicated like an online identifier (usually a string of letters and / or numbers) that gets attached to you. Under PIPEDA and the CCPA, the equivalent concept is “personal information,” which is roughly the same. Any mention of “personal data” in this Policy shall also mean personal information.\n\n2. The Kevala Platform\n\nWe build a range of services for employees and organizations to change the healthcare industry for the better. Our services include:\n\nThe community platform that we offer at our website (www.kevala.care and local variants) is referred to as the “Site(s).”\n\nKevala’s Sites, applications and related services, information and communications are collectively referred to as the “Kevala Platform.”\n\n‍\n\nOrganizational account information\n\nSome experiences and services within the Kevala Platform allow organizations to interact with employees and employees to interact with organizations. If a user is granted access to an organization, the owner of the organization or a designated administrator may control and administer details of your account. For example, deciding your access rights, making decisions about your personal information, or requiring you to take certain actions. If your access rights are amended by the owner or designated administrator, then you may lose access to the information that is in the control of the organization.\n\n‍\n\nYour use of the Kevala Platform as part of an organization’s account may be subject to the organization’s policies, which may be different from this Statement. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other organizations, and you should consider both the organization's policies and whether you are comfortable enabling the organization with access to your information prior to connecting to their services.\n\n3.

You are also responsible for protecting your information.\n\n‍\n\nYour Kevala account is password-protected so that only you and authorized Kevala staff have access to your account information. In order to maintain this protection, do not give your password to anyone.

      "# [Smart scheduling, open shift and workforce management on 2025-02-19](https://www.kevala.care/customer-stories)\nKevala is more than a schedule: it’s an intelligent system that unleashes the full power of your workforce. We go beyond scheduling shifts by empowering teams to work smarter, reducing staff burnout, and delivering exceptional care.\n\nOverstaff, and you’re burning money. Understaff, and you’re compromising care. Balance staffing levels with precision—ensure your team has the right regulatory, census and acuity requirements every time with the push of a button. Smart Scheduling quickly matches shifts to skills, credentials, and preferences—reducing burnout, turnover, and extra operational costs allowing your team to deliver higher quality care.\n\nCompliance without\n\nthe chaos\n\nStop chasing down credentials. Kevala tracks uploaded images of credentials—license numbers, expiration dates, and certifications—in real-time, keeping compliance airtight without the hassle. And with proactive reminders, no one’s scrambling at the last minute. Less paperwork, fewer compliance risks, and zero guesswork.\n\nCallouts are the worst, but we have you covered\n\nLast-minute callouts don’t have to disrupt your day. Kevala lets staff report absences by phone or text, automatically setting the shift coverage process in motion. Our smart policies prioritize your internal team, cutting agency reliance and costs, while instant notifications to eligible staff help fill shifts fast."

They're looking for candidates interested in the Mission first. Do you think they missed something?\n\nconsidering the capital-M Mission(tm) is healthcare staffing and compliance, i can't credibly sell any sort of lie about how i have always wanted to do staffing and compliance ever since i was a child.\n\napparently thinking it is a reasonable product goal is not sufficient.\n\n### Comment ID iftl20k with +7 score by [(flummox1234, Reddit, 2022-07-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/comments/vwqufi/anyone_from_kevala_health/iftl20k/) (in reply to ID ifsdrmk):\nlol the only \"mission\" is your paycheck AFAIC. that's a huge red flag to me especially in this tech hiring environment.

Brands such as BHRT Naturals, etc., that you can easily get online without any kind of prescription and that list \"wild yam\" as their chief ingredient -- are these just useless products? I have read varying accounts, but I think the overall medical consensus is that \"wild yam\" products are not in any way helping to mimic real hormonal responses in the body -- particularly the progesterone creams. In order to REALLY get a proper MHT response, do you need to get a prescription for the real deal?

The fact is, everybody is different and no product works the same for everyone. People who say things don't work for them can only speak for themselves and should not say anything is a scam just because of their experience. People have different sensitivity to foods and meds.\n\n\nI've had endometrial hyperplasia for about fifteen years. Basically, due to hormone imbalance caused from thyroid issues I'd start a period that was extremely heavy most of the time, like life threatening heavy to the point I couldn't contain it at times, that wouldn't stop on its own (first it happened it lasted nine months). It would lessen at times but never stop. My body just didn't provide the hormone balance to tell my uterus to stop shedding. \n\n\nWhenever I'd have a period that didn't stop the treatment was pretty much get a D&C and birth control pills and/or progesterone pills. I had horrible reactions and experiences with the pills.\n\n\n After complaining to my second gyno about the side effects of the meds and being ignored, I stopped taking them. Eventually, like two years later, I went into another neverending period. At the time I didn't have insurance and was in a bad financial situation, so I tried over the counter progesterone cream. It worked beautifully, and best part was it was mild enough that I had no noticable side effects. It didn't cost me $50 a month like the prescription and it was easy to stop using it. I only used it as needed. \n\n\nI did have some mood changes on it but I've always had mood issues with PMS, and only ever needed it for about 5-7 days at a time, maybe two to three times a year. I also noticed it needed to be fresh and became less effective a few months after opening it despite not being expired. \n\n\nI wish I'd tried the cream sooner because it was magical for me, especially after years of being tortured by procedures and prescriptions with horrible side effects. I've always been really sensitive to medication and have tons of allergies, so maybe somebody who isn't sensitive wouldn't have the same experience. For me it works great. I can't say it's healthy because I don't know long-term effects, and I'm not saying it'll work for everyone, but I can swear on my life it solved my problem. \n\n\nDue to thyroid issues and extreme stress I started having issues with my cycle many years before being diagnosed. I'd skip periods and then have ones that were really heavy and lasted several weeks. This became normal for me. If I'd known then what I know now, I'd have been experimenting with OTC hormone therapy long ago. Doctors don't know everything and try to apply the same school if thought they were trained in to everyone, and they're often wrong. \n\n\nAlso, I take wild yam root regularly and have for over a year along with other supplements, and I think over time it does help. I'd been having regular, normal  periods. Then I stopped taking it a couple of months ago and had an abnormal period and other issues. I started back on it about month ago and just had a normal period. It could be coincidence, but I don't notice any ill effect, so I'm not going off of it again any time soon. Many herbal type of remedies take time to work. \n\n\nAs far the argument that OTC aren't regulated like prescriptions, well yes, but you can't go by just that. The FDC isn't doing their job and can be bought. But supplements from reputable companies and do research on them.\n\n## Comment ID i7yv47q with +8 score by [(leftylibra, Reddit, 2022-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/um09bg/otc_estrogen_and_progesterone_creams/i7yv47q/) (in reply to ID um09bg):\nFrom Dr. Jen Gunter (author of *The Menopause Manifesto*)\n\n[Topical Progesterone Is a Scam](https://vajenda.substack.com/p/topical-progesterone-is-a-scam?s=r)\n\nFrom the Medical Journal of Australia: [Transdermal progesterone creams for postmenopausal women: more hype than hope?](https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2005/182/5/transdermal-progesterone-creams-postmenopausal-women-more-hype-hope)\n\n### Comment ID i7yvtup with +6 score by [(Impossible-Will-8414, Reddit, 2022-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/um09bg/otc_estrogen_and_progesterone_creams/i7yvtup/) (in reply to ID i7yv47q):\nYes, that's what I thought -- but I see a lot of women on here who use these OTC BHRT creams.

It’s a very difficult hormone to transfer cutaneously and the OTC stuff simply doesn’t accomplish this AT ALL. That’s why you don’t see ANY big\n pharma cutaneous progesterone. Mainly a patch like Combipatch, which has an artificial progesterone that more easily passes cutaneously. There are no such things in the OTC creams.

Based on three key factors: \n\n* A set of high material quality-of-life indicators coinciding  with moderate per-capita incomes, both distributed across nearly the  entire population of Kerala.\n* A set of wealth and resource redistribution programmes that have  largely brought about the high material quality-of-life indicators.\n* High levels of political participation and activism among ordinary  people along with substantial numbers of dedicated leaders at all  levels. Kerala's mass activism and committed cadre were able to function  within a largely democratic structure, which their activism has served  to reinforce.\n\nKerala's unusual socioeconomic and demographic situation was summarized by author and environmentalist [Bill McKibben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_McKibben):\n\n>Kerala, a state in India, is a bizarre anomaly among developing  nations, a place that offers real hope for the future of the Third  World. Though not much larger than Maryland, Kerala has a population as  big as California's and a per capita annual income of less than $300.   But its infant mortality rate is very low, its literacy rate among the  highest on Earth, and its birthrate below America's and falling faster.   Kerala's residents live nearly as long as Americans or Europeans.   Though mostly a land of paddy-covered plains, statistically Kerala  stands out as the Mount Everest of social development; there's truly no  place like it.\n\nI'm surprised I haven't seen it cited by more socialists and communists, since these policies were first created by a communist named EMS.

Racist memes about street shitting in India are easily countered by demonstrating that it is communists who ended this. \n\nHowever, we shouldn't be dishonest: Kerala is at best a social democracy that is also financed a lot through remittances from Indian guest workers in the UAE and Saudi-Arabia. This is nothing the CPI(M) should be blamed for, as far as I can see it, they are still a revolutionary party, but they are doing what they can within in the constraints of an Indian state, but at least they're doing a much better job than the neoliberal hellscape that is imposed on the rest of India by the BJP.\n\n### Comment ID fgldhqe with +1 score by [(hungarian_conartist, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgldhqe/) (in reply to ID fgizv5e):\n>because it proves that a communist party is actually electable and doesn't immediately cause a famine or whatever when in power.\n\nNo it doesn't.

As background, I'm an American-born Indian who visits Kerala every year or so to see my relatives. Here are my observations. \n\nFirst, if you visit the area, you'll find scores of unemployed or underemployed men and women. \n\nSecond, the young people of Kerala (excepting those who are not particularly highly-educated and home-bodies) by and large seek to immigrate to the West for higher education; most do not come back. The region is experiencing a brain and talent drain. This is not sustainable in the twenty-first century.\n\nThird, starting a small business in the area is exceedingly difficult, as worker strikes, power outages, and labor shortages pose significant challenges to successful operation. \n\nFourth, many multinational corporations are hesitant about investing in the state given these conditions. \n\nFifth, many parts of Kerala would be considered risky for women to walk alone in, even during the daylight, as there is, unfortunately, a large contingent of unemployed men who seemingly have nothing better to do than make women feel uncomfortable; when my wife and I visited Kerala last January, she experienced this. \n\nSixth, and this is my anecdotal observation, alcoholism is a chronic problem in many households as the men do not have steady and sufficient employment. \n\nSeventh, if you ask Kerala expats who live in the United States whether they would ever go back and live in Kerala, the answer will virtually always be no. I asked my father if he would go back to Kerala, and while he occasionally makes statements about returning to the old country (which men of a certain generation do, I suppose), he would never follow through on this, a position held by many ex-Keralites. In my dad's words, even making minimum wage in America at Wal-Mart, while not ideal, would be better by sheer virtue of being in America. The safety-net in Kerala is only one in name and does not guarantee any upward mobility. At least in America, one can use the safety-net to move forward. In fact, this is what my parents, both of whom are Kerala expats, did in the 1980s. Their American success story is literally impossible to achieve in Kerala.\n\nSo yes, high literacy is great, but let us not be deluded into thinking that Kerala is a great success story. It is doing better than other parts of India, which is important, but this misses the existential and spiritual crisis one feels upon landing at the airport there. Everytime I go back, I thank God my parents had the foresight to leave before my siblings and I were born.\n\nEdit: added clarifying details and organization.\n\n### Comment ID fgj01ue with +28 score by [(XasthurWithin, Reddit, 2020-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgj01ue/) (in reply to ID fgiy34y):\nThat you don't have international corporations and constant labour strikes isn't necessarily a bad thing.\n\nHow is Kerala compared to the rest of India?\n\n#### Comment ID fgj0jmu with +23 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgj0jmu/) (in reply to ID fgj01ue):\nMost of his point can hardly be linked to the \"model\" in my uninformed opinion\n\n#### Comment ID fgj1l8q with +19 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgj1l8q/) (in reply to ID fgj01ue):\nFirst, I would challenge your assumption that not having international corporations and having constant labor strikes is fine. \n\n**Multinational companies provide streams of capital.** These companies build factories, invest in job-training centers, support educational facilities, and create incentives for local government to attract better talent. Without these incentives, a government bureaucrat tends to look at local problems through the lens of \"good enough,\" as in \"these roads are good enough for us, why invest in paving them\" or \"these power cuts are fine, there aren't any factories depending on them.\"\n\n**Multinational corporations provide local employment.** If you step outside of the developed world for a moment, the average person works in an agriculture-related position. Almost 70% of the jobs found in the poorest countries of the world are based on this industry, compared to less than 5% which is located in the wealthiest nations in the world. Multinationals come in, offer higher wages (which are still low compared to global standards), then shift the standard of living. The average real wages have almost tripled since 2018 in the developing and emerging G20 countries since 2008. For example, India had the highest levels, achieving an index rating of 5.5 compared to the regional 3.7 average.\n\n**Multinational corporations help incentive improving the local infrastructure.** Similar to discussion from the first point, companies must have employees who can access job sites to become productive. That means an investment in the local infrastructure becomes necessary before operations even begin. Roads, bridges, and technology access are three of the largest barriers taken down when multinationals become active in a developing country. You’ll see education investments to improve labor skills, along with public transportation development and other unique needs that some nations may require. In Kerala, the shoddy infrastructure means that a major car company like Toyota would never come because power cuts and outages would be significantly disruptive to the regional supply chain. \n\n**Multinational corporations help diversify local economies.** Many parts of India rely on primary products for subsistence. These products tend to be related to agriculture-based industries. Multinationals provide the economies of regions in the developing world with more variety, creating diversity in local production levels. That reduces reliance on commodities which often have volatile prices because their supply and demand levels waiver so often.\n\nHappy to discuss this further, but these are the thoughts that immediately come to my mind regarding your first sentence. Yes, multinationals aren't perfect, and we can certainly list ways in which multinationals aren't great for the developing world. But, on the whole, they tend to be better than they aren't. \n\nKerala is slightly ahead of India in some areas, but to call it a success story is like saying a car with three flat tires is significantly better than a car with four flat tires. In my opinion, Kerala's story is tragic because, whereas other parts of India have lower literacy and higher infant mortality, those highly-literate Keralites leave home and never come back. Accordingly, the population demographics of Kerala have, and will continue to, become older and older. Again, this is not sustainable. Anecdotally, I would say Kerala has maybe twenty years left before it becomes like any other under-developing state in India.\n\n#### Comment ID fgkgzwv with +3 score by [(ReckingFutard, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgkgzwv/) (in reply to ID fgj01ue):\nIts unemployment rate is way above average.\n\n#### Comment ID fglcebn with +1 score by [(hungarian_conartist, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fglcebn/) (in reply to ID fgj01ue):\nKeralan economy is reliant on remittances from the young supporting parents by working overseas in the west or places like Saudi Arabia.

But it's not as great as often represented.\n\n**Low entrepreneurship**\n\nThe model is practically set to not reward risk taking behaviour such as entrepreneurship. In the short run, this doesn't make much difference. In the long run, this is severely detrimental to growth.\n\n**Low business friendliness**\n\nMultinational companies are less willing to invest in Kerala. Not surprising, since the govt does not have very friendly policy for businesses. So they invest in other places - Hyderabad, Bangalore, Delhi etc. \n\n**High brain drain**\n\nThis ties into the above two. If people don't have new and exciting avenues to work in, they leave. Kerala has one of the highest expat populations. A state that leaks resources like that will not continue this for long.\n\nThen there's the fact that there are a lot of other factors at play that you have ignored. \nIt is true that Kerala has a moderately rich populace. But it is also true that Kerala is a thin state on a sea shore, by which I mean to say that almost all the state has access to the sea, which automatically means greater prosperity. If it were land locked and had a similar accomplishment, now that would be quite a feat. A coastal state being richer than others, that's not really an anomaly. \n\n\nThen there's social reforms. Kerala boasts of a lot of social reformers, something the rest of India can not. This led to a breakdown of repressive social values. Couples with the fact that a lot of Malyali communities had a status of women unparalleled in the rest of India, Kerala had far higher *hands on deck*, as they say. \n\n\n*I'm posted in India and I have a Malyali girlfriend.*\n\n## Comment ID fgl0acs with +2 score by [(nedstarkin, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgl0acs/) (in reply to ID eyrn7s):\nJust to add one point here.

But now for what might be a bit of a hot take: new systems should never base themselves on any existent system, no matter how successful that system may be, at least not heavily. The circumstances in which systems come into being and function are always unique, and they can cause systems that would otherwise fail to be successful and systems that would otherwise be successful to fail. There are lessons to be learned from Kerala, and from Cuba, and Burkina Faso, and other countries. But using one as a model is dangerous business and individual examples of various systems in action are unreliable indicators of the viability of a certain method. I believe that we should be looking at Kevala, picking out individual pieces of the structure that work and applying them in turn. For the larger picture, we should be looking instead to the theory on which those successes are based, and how best they can be implemented in our unique situations.\n\n## Comment ID fgkhssb with +1 score by [(Leonidas391, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgkhssb/) (in reply to ID eyrn7s):\nKerala is a decent model for socialist policymaking in underdeveloped nations, but it offers little guidance for socialists operating in developed/developing nations. Kerala proves that economic growth by itself isn't necessary to improve public welfare outcomes (at least to a point), but its agrarian model and lack of independence from India itself (not arguing for or against, just saying) doesn't bode well for socialists trying to organize factory and office workers.

A different kind of Communist party.\n\n> CPI's 1957 constitution stated it would allow the existence of opposing parties after it had parliamentary majority. Party leaders, like Namboodiripad, did not like the idea of using military force to remain in power because it would reflect poorly on the CPI as a whole on a global stage. This reliance on the people's opinions created a benevolent communist government, but it also made it more difficult to enact radical reforms. **Therefore, the reforms of the CPI in Kerala were mainly moderately socialist.**\n\nMaybe not Communist at all.\n\n---\n\n> **Agrarian reform**         \nOne of the major changes advocated by the CPI was the Agrarian Relations Bill, passed in 1961. The bill was intentionally moderate because those drafting it knew it would have to pass through many constitutional channels before it would be made into a law. Over 1,000 amendments were debated due to party divisions. **Though the bill was moderate, it still changed the farming system. It abolished feudalism and aimed to create a   \n ---> capitalist <---   \nagricultural system. The CPI did not push more radical Communist land reforms. Namboodiripad stated they would not attempt state ownership or collective farms because even though such ideas might appeal to intellectuals on a scientific basis, they would not actually help the peasantry in practice**. \n\nYes! They are not typical Communist morons and they know Marxist pseudo-intellectuals are full of shit.\n\n> The bill aimed to improve wages and working conditions as well as secure employment. Landlords were only allowed to work on their land if they paid compensation, which helped protect the tenants’ rights.\n\n---\n\n> **Industrial reform**       \n> As the CPI in Kerala was ultimately controlled by the federal government, its state plan depended on the funds it could raise independently. It struggled to industrialize and develop new manufacturing plants in Kerala throughout the 1960s while balancing out the disparities of industrialization. The CPI had Industries ministers who were responsible for industrial development. It also had an Industrial Development Cooperation that gave financial assistance to companies to help them startup new manufacturing projects. In the early 1970s, the CPI created two new corporations to help with industrial development: the Kerala Industrial and Technical Consultancy Organization and the Kerala State Electronics Development Corporation. These measures improved industry on a state level, but were less successful at the local level. **To revitalize local industry, the CPI launched an ambitious Four-Year Plan, perhaps modeling itself after Stalin's Five-Year Plans which Namboodiripad considered an inspiration. The Four-Year Plan involved district-level conventions to excite potential entrepreneurs since the government wanted more private investors to spur industry. These entrepreneurs were trained to set up their own industries. The plan was hugely successful within the first 6 weeks and managed to set up eleven new industrial estates, but then lagged as the program continued.**\n\nIt seems the government in Kerala calls itself Communist and wide eyed innocents like you and your sources believe it, but they are actually pursuing moderate policies. \n\nCiting Stalin's five year plan is odd, but their actual plan was exactly the opposite of Stalin's. It was **\"to excite entrepreneurs since the government wanted more private investors to spur industry (!!!).\"**  while Stalin wanted to crush entrepreneurs to concentrate all power in the hands of the party, the stupidest policy ever.\n\n### Comment ID fgiy7fq with +5 score by [(SternerStirner, Reddit, 2020-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgiy7fq/) (in reply to ID fgivweq):\n........You say that buddy is looking for a successful Socialist government then proceed to say that Kerala isn't Communist, it's Moderate Communist, which is Socialist, in ideological terms not internal Commie terms.

Being reactive, or getting easily worked up, prevents us from acting with precision (which can ultimately be more impactful).

Yoga won't get you \"enlightened\". It might help you cope with the reality of this often depressing and violent world. Other times it might collide with some elements of your life, like your shitty job. Real enlightement is finding peace within yourself, that's what's spiritual about yoga, nothing else, no shiny third eyes. Not even ego loss - when you hear someone talk about losing ego, you should know they are narcissistic egomaniacs. Your ego is you, it's a scared kid still living inside our aging bodies, you don't need to lose it.

I'm a geri psych nurse, and I sometimes think, it'd be cool to not be worried that someone could die or I'd make a med error or something like that, or someone is going to get hurt...\n\n### Comment ID kqh51pu with +2 score by [(tobicouture, Reddit, 2024-02-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqh51pu/) (in reply to ID kqh4yaw):\n(no offense to anyone who works office jobs, they seem fun)\n\n## Comment ID kqe7ipu with +2 score by [(DRdidgelikefridge, Reddit, 2024-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqe7ipu/) (in reply to ID 1aqcn4y):\nI’m 41. Started waking up couple years ago.  Started yoga 1.5 yr ago. Got more serious a few months ago. I work in an emergency room now. My life became about awakening more and helping people.  I’m one spiritual experience from going to live in the woods.\n\n## Comment ID kqfdku1 with +2 score by [(CatInSkiathos, Reddit, 2024-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqfdku1/) (in reply to ID 1aqcn4y):\nI've worked in finance and other related industries...have been practicing yoga for 13+ years.\n\nI don't think it's 'third eye opening' or the yoga per se...I think it's a combination of life stuff, supplemental benefit of increased mind/body connection, you realizing the bullshit at the core of things that were idealized, and now you feel a bit disillusioned by all of this.\n\nMost social media is full of posturing and fakeness. Most workplaces are also toxic and inherently dehumanizing.\n\nWhat's the point of achieving a target, when they keep moving the goalpost? \n\nIf it's 'never good enough' anyway, why even bother?\n\nIf it's feasible to take some time off, I would strongly recommend this. File for unemployment ASAP, figure out health insurance, get those ducks in a row. \n\nThen what do you want to do? Read? Travel? Spend a month alone in a mountain cabin? \n\nOn that note...keep in mind that there is no such thing as ultimate truth. Beliefs that serve you now, may change in the future. Neither may be 'wrong', just that what serves you, continues to evolve.\n\nKeep on keepin on.\n\n## Comment ID kqg9wwq with +2 score by [(Winter-Fun-3208, Reddit, 2024-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqg9wwq/) (in reply to ID 1aqcn4y):\nHow does one really know when their third eye is open?\n\n## Comment ID kqh4311 with +2 score by [(Readhikesleep, Reddit, 2024-02-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqh4311/) (in reply to ID 1aqcn4y):\nAnother 40 something that felt a change the past years as I practiced more or was it just maturing…I used to be very anxious and high strung. I worried so much about everything. Last year, I left the job\nI loved for 10 years, found a new job that was a terrible fit, quit it, got hired by a startup that didn’t happen, and got a new job all in 6 months. This would have had me spiraling years ago, but I just went with it and let it work itself out.\n\n## Comment ID kqhxgqj with +2 score by [(katiejoyw11, Reddit, 2024-02-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqhxgqj/) (in reply to ID 1aqcn4y):\nYeah, and I just quit my job in consulting to pursue greater work-life balance in the public sector. I'm also more interested in serving my community rather than the bottom line of my company and clients. I was told, \"you used to be ambitious, but I guess you're not that person anymore.\" I just have to laugh!\n\n## Comment ID kqn2xa9 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-02-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqn2xa9/) (in reply to ID 1aqcn4y):\nI suddenly became extremely ok with the process, when slow movement felt like no movement at all for so long.   I’m honoring my needs and paying more attention to how I feel in my body. I’ve been practicing for about 8 months, and I can tell you that I was nowhere close to being that at peace with my perceived “sluggish” progress as I am now.  \n\nThere is something in the practice that makes daily challenges easier to manage. That’s HUGE.\n\n## Comment ID kqd4cnn with +3 score by [(No_Bag7577, Reddit, 2024-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqd4cnn/) (in reply to ID 1aqcn4y):\nI think work burnout is normal and not necessarily related to yoga. I just took my skill set from an industry that no longer interested me to one that I love and helps others. I have young children so I see the world differently now than before. \n\nI can’t speak much on the third eye except for when she makes herself known when I meditate. I think of her as an old friend who I welcome but am still getting to know.\n\n## Comment ID kqd5xup with +3 score by [(Expert-Campaign2306, Reddit, 2024-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqd5xup/) (in reply to ID 1aqcn4y):\nYes I feel this exactly. I'm very lucky in a way that my complete change in attitude towards work over the past couple years is something my workplace has been accommodating of. I work in a field where there are often breaks in-between projects. Most people get in a worry about taking an extended break without pay but I honestly look forward to them. This type of cycle works so well for me. I feel myself getting exhausted by the end of a big project and that feeling 2 months off before the next one is exactly fitting with my lifestyle. I can travel, go on a yoga retreat, work on my personal art, and visit family abroad. I'm so grateful my employer never guilts me into working late either. Sometimes it's up for offer but it is never a pressured expectation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID kqe638o with +1 score by [(Routine_Service_5521, Reddit, 2024-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqe638o/) (in reply to ID 1aqcn4y):\nI would say, if you have that kind of drive put it to work for yourself. You will never make money working for others. Money is not a goal I personally strive to make more of. As long as I can live a comfortable life,my bills are paid, I am happy. I find when you do something you love as a job, you don't work a day in yr life. Change is tough, but usually brings better things. I'd say go after whatever it is you love, for employment. Even if you are working for another you'll be much more fulfilled doing something you love\n\n## Comment ID kqfjh3a with +1 score by [(nomarenamata, Reddit, 2024-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqfjh3a/) (in reply to ID 1aqcn4y):\nPTSD and anxiety from mobbing pushed me to quit a job that always felt meaningless to me.

The rat race, especially in finance, always keeps moving the goalposts. It feels like you're never achieving anything. Plus, it's an incredibly materialistic and competitive environment. Maybe that's not what gives you purpose and meaning.\n\n\nPeople who find purpose and meaning in their work are always happier. I encourage you to seek out what is more meaningful to you.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can continue in your career, but to realize that you don't find purpose and meaning in it, and with that realization, categorize it a simply a livelihood, and seek out purpose and meaning in other activities."

      "# [Avocado Oil Market Trends and Forecast Report 2025-2033 Featuring Olivado Group, The Village Press, Chosen Foods, La Tourangelle, Spectrum Organics, Crofts, Kevala, and Bella Vado by Research and Markets on 2025-02-13](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/02/13/3026097/28124/en/Avocado-Oil-Market-Trends-and-Forecast-Report-2025-2033-Featuring-Olivado-Group-The-Village-Press-Chosen-Foods-La-Tourangelle-Spectrum-Organics-Crofts-Kevala-and-Bella-Vado.html)\nDublin, Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Avocado Oil Market Size and Share Analysis - Growth Trends and Forecast Report 2025-2033\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\nAvocado Oil market is expected to reach US$ 1.06 billion by 2033 from US$ 604.4 million in 2024, with a CAGR of 5.79% from 2025 to 2033\n\nSome of the key drivers driving the market in the area are the rising prevalence of lifestyle diseases, the growing desire to cook meals in a healthy oil enhanced with vital nutrients, and the rising use of dietary supplements.\n\nGrowing consumer knowledge of avocado oil's health advantages is the main factor driving its market share. Monounsaturated fats found in avocado oil are associated with a decreased risk of heart disease and a reduction in bad cholesterol. For instance, coronary heart disease affects around 110 million women and 145 million men worldwide, representing a substantial rise in the risk of cardiovascular disease. In addition, avocado oil contains antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that support general health. When it comes to cooking oils, people are also looking for better options, and avocado oils have a better health profile.\n\nThe market for avocado oil is expected to increase as a result of the companies in the industry continuing to improve their goods with certified organic oils. For example, the French pharmaceutical business Laboratoires Expanscience introduced its new organic avocado oil in March 2021 by cold pressing dehydrated entire avocados from Peru. Ecocert Greenlife has certified this new organic virgin avocado oil as 100% organic in accordance with COSMOS guidelines.\n\nGrowing usage in personal care and cosmetics\n\nThe cosmetics and personal care sectors are among the leading drivers of the avocado oil market's expansion. Avocado oil is widely used in cosmetic goods like moisturizers, serums, hair treatments, and lip care products because of its moisturizing, anti-aging, and calming properties. Avocado oil's use in luxury skincare products is also encouraged by its deep hydration and improvement of skin suppleness. Avocado oil is strategically positioned for producers looking to reach consumers in this niche market due to the rising desire for natural, plant-based cosmetics.\n\nChallenges in the Avocado Oil Market\n\nSupply Chain Issues\n\nThe restricted cultivation capacity in important producing regions, like Mexico, which leads the world in avocado production, presents supply chain problems for the avocado oil market. It may be challenging to satisfy growing worldwide demand as a result of this concentration. Furthermore, variables like pests, illnesses, and erratic weather can have a big influence on crop yields, which might alter the supply of avocados.\n\nBecause avocado crops vary throughout the year, seasonal unpredictability makes matters more difficult and might result in price volatility or supply shortages. These issues have an impact on avocado oil output, making it more volatile and affecting market stability, especially during times of high demand.\n\nDiverse Consumer Preferences\n\nBecause of the wide range of consumer tastes, the avocado oil market is quite fragmented. Based on factors like taste, production methods, or health advantages, consumers seek out different varieties of avocado oil, such as organic, cold-pressed, or refined. Because of this diversity, producers face difficulties in determining whether to focus on a single market niche or provide a variety of goods to appeal to a wider spectrum of consumers.\n\nIt becomes challenging to standardize items across a range of tastes, particularly as the market for premium, natural, and ecologically friendly products grows. In order to satisfy different consumer demands and foster brand loyalty in a cutthroat and varied market, companies must make investments in customized marketing, clear labeling, and specialized production procedures.\n\nExtra-virgin avocado oil is expected to dominate the global market\n\nExtra virgin avocado oil's outstanding quality and health benefits could make it the industry leader globally. It is particularly popular for culinary and personal care applications since it keeps the highest levels of vitamins and antioxidants with minimal processing, which contributes to its success in the market. California Olive Ranch unveiled a new range of environmentally friendly aluminum bottles in April 2023. Their commitment to ecology and excellence is further demonstrated by the fact that these totally recyclable bottles are their smallest and lightest. The company wants to make its best-selling premium olive oil more reasonably priced. They are available both online and in physical places across the country.\n\nAvocado oil is expected to drive significant demand in food applications\n\nFood and beverages are expected to be one of the major uses in the global avocado oil market because of the oil's adaptability and fitness benefits. Avocado oil is a popular choice for cooking, salad dressings, dips, and marinades since it enhances the flavor and nutritional profile of a variety of foods, which leads to its widespread use in the food industry.\n\nCompany Analysis: Overview, Recent Developments, Revenue Analysis\n\nOlivado Group, Grupo Industrial Batellero\n\nThe Village Press\n\nChosen Foods LLC\n\nLa Tourangelle\n\nSpectrum Organics\n\nCrofts Limited\n\nKevala\n\nBella Vado Avocado Oil\n\nKey Attributes:\n\nReport AttributeDetailsNo. of Pages120Forecast Period2024 - 2033Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024$0.64 BillionForecasted Market Value (USD) by 2033$1.06 BillionCompound Annual Growth Rate5.7%Regions CoveredGlobal\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n1.

      "# [Avocado Oils Tested for Phthalates — Buying Guide by Leah Segedie on 2024-08-06](https://www.mamavation.com/food/avocado-oils-tested-for-phthalates-buying-guide.html)\nWhich avocado oils have the least toxic phthalate contamination? Phthalates are hormone-disrupting chemicals in plastics & fragrances that find their way into many foods and personal care products. To solve this puzzle, Mamavation sent several of the most popular avocado oils off to an EPA-certified laboratory to test for several types of phthalates to find out. You’ve trusted Mamavation to cover topics like safest olive oils tested for phthalates, safest coconut oils tested for phthalates, safest salt sans heavy metals and microplastics, safest cookware without PFAS “forever chemicals” and nanoparticles, and safest water purifiers that filter PFAS, now join us for another consumer study on avocado oils and hormone-disrupting phthalates.\n\nDisclosure: This consumer study is released in partnership with Environmental Health News. Scientific reviews were performed by (1) Terrence Collins, Teresa Heinz Professor of Green Chemistry & Director of the Institute for Green Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University, (2) Linda S. Birnbaum, Scientist Emeritus and Former Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and National Toxicology Program & Scholar in Residence at Duke University, Adjunct Professor at the University of North Carolina, & Yale University, & (3) Pete Myers, Chief Scientist at Environmental Health Sciences, Adjunct Professor of Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University, and Co-Author of Our Stolen Future.

You can also give a tax-deductible donation to our consumer studies here through Environmental Health Sciences. Thank you! Copyright © 2024 Mamavation — All Rights Reserved\n\nPhthalates Found in Popular Avocado Oils\n\nMamavation’s EPA-certified laboratory found phthalates in 11 popular avocado oils. These chemicals are linked to serious health effects, which we will discuss later. Because phthalates are so problematic to hormones, Mamavation has commissioned our own scientific studies on phthalates in food products to make recommendations for the safest avocado oils. Continue reading Mamavation’s article on these products to find which brands have the lowest amounts of phthalates according to our laboratory.\n\nFor this consumer study, Mamavation sent 11 popular avocado oils from 11 brands to an EPA-certified laboratory looking for phthalates. Because Mamavation only tested one product per brand, we cannot claim to know if these issues are, in fact, industry-wide or portfolio-wide. However, based on our “spot-check” of the industry, this is what we found:\n\n100% of avocado oils analyzed by our laboratory had traces of phthalates. This is a total of 11 detections from 11 avocado oil products.\n\nRanges of phthalates were from 76 parts per billion (ppb) to 56,808 ppb. Based on the amounts presented, we created 4 categories to communicate levels of phthalates found: (1) Avocado oils with the most contamination (2) Avocado oils with still very high contamination, (3) Avocado oils with intermediate contamination, & (4) Avocado Oils with the least contamination. These categories are not based on health impacts. They are based on presenting data and where the middle ground lies in each category. We then added 2 results from Defend Our Health’s study on phthalates to give our audience more variety in choices.\n\n9% of Avocado oil products had over 20,000 ppb phthalates. That’s 1 bottle out of 11 avocado oils. We dubbed this the “Are You Kidding Me?” realm, which would have the highest amount of phthalates.\n\n18% of Avocado oil products had between 2,000 ppb and 20,000 phthalates. That’s 2 out of 11 bottles of avocado oils over 2,000 ppb. We dubbed this the “Not Our Favorite Avocado Oils with High Contamination” realm.\n\n27% of avocado oil products had between 800 ppb and 2,000 ppb phthalates. That’s 3 out of 11 bottles of avocado oil between 800 ppb and 2,000 ppb. We dubbed this the “Better Avocado Oils with Intermediate Contamination” realm.\n\n45% of avocado oil products had less than 800 ppb phthalates. That’s 5 out of 11 bottles of avocado oil that had below 800 ppb. We dubbed this the “Best Avocado Oils with Least Contamination” realm.\n\nIf you are using avocado oil to prepare meals for your family or as personal care, this investigation will be very important to follow to reduce your family’s exposure to phthalates. However, as you can see, every avocado oil manufacturer whose products Mamavation studied has work to do to remove phthalates from their products. None of the avocado oils that were tested by Mamavation or by Defend Our Health had zero detections of phthalates.\n\nPhthalates are typically found inside plastics and in undisclosed fragrances. When in plastics, they work to make the plastic more flexible. When they are in fragrances, they help carry the scent longer in the air. These chemical contaminants are found in many types of products that are involved in the food service industry like food service gloves, tubing used in dairy operations, hoses, holding tanks, and conveyor belts inside manufacturing plants. In fact, there are so many places where phthalates can show up because they are legal indirect food additives used in manufacturing for both conventional AND organic foods. There is some movement to restrict some ortho-phthalate chemicals from food packaging but not from manufacturing in general.\n\nLinda S. Birnbaum, Scientist Emeritus and Former Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and National Toxicology Program & Scholar in Residence at Duke University, Adjunct Professor at the University of North Carolina & at Yale University had this to say about the study after her review: “Phthalates cause multiple adverse health effects, including developmental effects in the reproductive system and neurotoxicity. There is also evidence for causing cancer in laboratory animals.”\n\nTypes of Phthalates Found in Our Avocado Oil Study\n\nOur laboratory found five different types of phthalates in the coconut oil we sent to them. Here’s a brief breakdown of each one.\n\nDi-2-ethylhexyl Phthalate (DEHP): DEHP is a highly toxic endocrine disruptor. It was also the most common phthalate found by our lab and is found commonly in building products (wallpaper, wire, and cable insulation), clothing (footwear, raincoats), car products, food packaging, medical devices, and children’s products (toys, grip bumpers). This chemical is also on California’s Prop. 65 list of carcinogens and reproductive toxicants. In addition, it’s been linked to endocrine disruption, reproductive issues, developmental issues, liver & kidney toxicity, asthma & allergies, & thyroid problems.\n\nDiisodecyl phthalate (DIDP): Found commonly in PVC plastics, artificial leather, toys, carpet backing, covering on wires and cables, and pool liners. This chemical is also on California’s Prop. 65 list of carcinogens and reproductive toxicants. It’s associated with health concerns including liver & kidney toxicity, developmental issues, endocrine disruption, reproductive issues, asthma & allergies, & thyroid problems.\n\nBis(2-propylheptyl) Phthalate (DPHP): This type of phthalate is a substitute for other high molecular weight phthalates used primarily for high-temperature applications such as cable wires, roofing membranes, and food containers. It is used to soften plastics and is a general-use plasticizer under investigation as an endocrine disruptor. This phthalate is associated with additional health concerns like reproductive toxicity, prenatal, perinatal, & post-natal toxicity, and genotoxicity.\n\nDi-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP): This type of phthalate is a colorless, odorless, oily liquid that doesn’t evaporate easily used to keep plastics soft or more flexible. It is used for medical tubing and blood storage bags, wire and cables, carpetback coating, floor tile, adhesives, cosmetics, and pesticides. Animal studies have demonstrated increased fetal malformations and reduced body weights of offspring. DnOP comprises about 20% of commercial C6-10 phthalate mixtures used in flooring and carpet tiles, tarps, pool liners, and garden hoses. DnOP is approved by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) as an indirect food additive which is typically used in manufacturing as seam cements, bottle cap liners, and conveyor belts. DNOP are classified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as priority environmental pollutants.\n\nDibutyl phthalate (DBP): This type of phthalate is an organic compound commonly used as a plasticizer, and as an additive to\n\nadhesives or printing inks. It usually is a colorless oil, but can have a yellow color. Use of this substance in cosmetics, such as in nail polishes, is banned in the European Union. DBP is one of the six phthalic acid esters found on the Priority Pollutant List regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Animal studies have observed that DBP is toxic to fetal development. This phthalate is associated with additional health concerns like reproductive toxicity, prenatal, perinatal, & post-natal toxicity, and genotoxicity.\n\nDiisononyl phthalate (DINP): This type of phthalate is used as a plasticizer. The European Union has set restrictions on this chemical inside food contact materials because of the determination that it’s problematic to human health. DINP is also listed on the California Prop. 65 list of carcinogens and reproductive toxicants.\n\nAdditional Studies Finding Phthalates in Cooking Oils\n\nAnother scientific report co-authored by our friends at Defend Our Health published in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology found phthalates in a range of popular children’s foods and organic products in 2023. Included in this report were 2 avocado oils.\n\nMamavation took the results from this report and added it to our list of recommendations at the bottom of this post for your review, which was two additional results. However, all coconut oils, olive oils, & avocado oils tested by Defend Our Health also had trace amounts of phthalates. It’s not so much a question of whether there are phthalates present in coconut oils, olive oils, & avocado oils. It’s a matter of what levels are present. Both of our studies confirmed that these cooking oils have different levels of phthalates present.\n\nView our consumer study on olive oils here.\n\nView our consumer study on coconut oils here.\n\nPhthalates Have Specific Problematic Health Effects\n\nPhthalates are linked to many health effects from several studies on both animals and humans. This is very problematic because phthalates are linked with hormone disruption of the endocrine system, which regulates the body’s hormones, even in trace amounts in low concentrations. Epidemiological studies have revealed that exposure to phthalates adversely affects the level of hormones within the body, which can impact several important health functions. Here are some health effects phthalate exposure is linked to.\n\nWeight gain & obesity\n\nShorter height\n\nPrecocious puberty\n\nAsthma\n\nAllergies\n\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\n\nLower IQ\n\nSocial impairment\n\nType II diabetes and insulin resistance\n\nPoor cardiovascular health\n\nThyroid function and increased risk of thyroid cancer\n\nFemales: pregnancy loss and preterm birth, low birth weight, earlier menopause\n\nMales: genital development, semen quality, reduced “masculine” play, Inhibits testosterone production, Shortened anogenital distance, or shortened “taint” , Shortened length of penis\n\nTerrence Collins, Teresa Heinz Professor of Green Chemistry & Director of the Institute for Green Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University had this to say about the study during his scientific review: “An earlier Mamavation study found that olive oils are contaminated with phthalates. Now Mamavation is finding phthalates in avocado oils. Phthalates are anti-androgens—they disrupt male hormone action. Currently, highly chemicalized countries like America are experiencing a steady drop in male fertility, quantified through a population-level decline in mean sperm count and quality. Phthalate exposures are suspected of playing a role in the declines. Phthalate contamination of food oils is completely unacceptable! Like the olive oil manufacturers, the avocado oil manufacturers should begin acting to better protect their customers by thoroughly examining every aspect of their supply and manufacturing chains to ensure that all phthalates are eliminated. And then they should learn much more about endocrine disruption and become extremely diligent in producing products that are free of endocrine-disrupting chemicals. One has to wonder why the FDA appears to be asleep on the job.”\n\nHow are Phthalates Regulated in the Food Supply & Children’s Products?\n\nBecause phthalates are so problematic to human health, there are varying restrictions on products and food at the federal level. There is, however, no consistency among federal agencies to protect the public. For instance, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) restricts certain phthalates within children’s toys and childcare products. They prohibit the import and sale of those products that contain more than 0.1% of the following phthalates:\n\ndi-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)\n\ndibutyl phthalate (DBP)\n\nbenzyl butyl phthalate (BBP)\n\ndiisononyl phthalate (DINP)\n\ndiisobutyl phthalate (DIBP)\n\ndi-n-pentyl phthalate (DPENP)\n\ndi-n-hexyl phthalate (DHEXP)\n\ndicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP)\n\nEven though the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission restricted 8 ortho-phthalates in products intended for use by children, you still see some of the same chemicals approved as indirect additives by the FDA in the food supply even when those foods are marketed to children. Furthermore, the FDA denied a citizen petition in 2022 which demanded to take these phthalate chemicals out of the food supply because they impact the hormones of children.\n\nCalifornia also has some restrictions under the Prop. 65 list of Carcinogens and Reproductive Toxicants, requiring products sold over the limits to be accompanied by a warning. Any consumer living in California who tests and finds products with specific phthalate amounts outside the limits may bring a Prop. 65 lawsuit six months after serving the company with a public notification letter. However, be advised these limits are not enforceable. California’s “right to know” law is only about warning the consumer about the carcinogenic chemicals present. Therefore, California cannot force companies to recall products that are above these limits. Here are the phthalate-criteria:\n\nBBP – Maximum Allowable Dose Levels (MADL) 1,200 μg/day (oral)\n\nDBP – MADL 8.7 μg/day\n\nDIDP – MADL 2,200 μg/day\n\nDnHP – MADL 2,200 μg/day\n\nDEHP – No Significant Risk Level (NSRL) 310 μg/day (adult), MADL 4,200 μg/day (intravenous adult), MADL 600 (intravenous infant), MADL 410 ug/day (oral for adult), MADL 58 ug/day (oral for infant).\n\nDINP – NSRL 146 μg/day\n\nIn terms of avocado oils, it could be possible that the vast majority of phthalates are finding their way into the product during manufacturing, storage, or transportation. Under the Food & Drug Administration 21 CFR rules, FDA regulates food, drugs, cosmetics, and food contact materials within the United States. The FDA sanctioned the use of 25 plasticizers via an amendment to food additive regulations: 21 CFR Part 175 through 21 CFR Part 178. These regulations allow the use of phthalates in the food supply as “indirect food additives” that can be present. These chemicals can find their way into your food in many ways during manufacturing such as:\n\nAdhesives and components of coatings used in food contact materials.\n\nComponents of paper and paperboard, such as paperboard that is in contact with aqueous and fatty foods or used as a defoaming agent on the paperboard.\n\nAdjuvants, production aids, and sanitizers used in manufacturing.\n\nPlasticizers in polymeric substances, such as phthalates in plastic PVA or PVC sheets in food contact materials OR vinyl chloride homopolymers or copolymers used in food contact materials.\n\nSurface lubricants used to make metallic products.\n\nThe European Union has banned or restricted several phthalates such as DEHP, DBP, DIBP, and BBP in a wide range of products since 2020. These bans and restrictions include children’s swimming aids, flooring, coated fabrics and paper, recreational gear, mattresses, footwear, and office supplies, among other categories. These chemicals are not expected to be found in foods above certain thresholds. However, not all phthalates are restricted or tested for either.\n\nOther Categories of Products Mamavation Has Tested for Toxic Contaminants\n\nBefore we launch into the raw data from our lab, we wanted to remind you about all the other studies we have done on indications of PFAS “forever chemicals,” pesticides, & heavy metals inside the food and consumer products you may bring inside your home. Each one of these studies were done in a similar fashion as this study with brands sent independently to the certified lab and raw data of those labs at the bottom of the post.\n\nSoft Contact Lenses\n\nGreen Beauty Makeup\n\nLip Balm\n\nCondoms & Lubricants\n\nDental Floss\n\nToilet Paper\n\nTissue Paper\n\nPeriod Underwear\n\nTampons\n\nSanitary Pads, Pantiliners, & Incontinence Pads\n\nPowdered Electrolytes\n\nCinnamon\n\nSalt\n\nButter Wrappers\n\nPasta & Tomato Sauces\n\nNut Butters (Peanut butter, etc.)\n\nCoffee\n\nOlive oils\n\nCoconut oils\n\nKetchup\n\nActivewear (Yoga Pants)\n\nSports Bras\n\nParchment Paper\n\nCupcake Liners\n\nPlastic-Free Straws\n\nSandwich Baggies (Both plastic & more “sustainable” options)\n\nFast Food Packaging\n\nFurniture\n\nChildren’s Probiotics\n\nKids’ Backpacks\n\nBaby Strollers\n\nBaby Bottles\n\nMamavation’s Investigation of Avocado Oils & Phthalates\n\nFor this study, avocado oils were purchased between February 2023 and May 2024. Each product was recorded in our database and sent directly to the lab within its original packaging. Unfortunately, 100% of avocado oils tested had at least trace amounts of ortho-phthalates, a class of hormone-disrupting chemicals.\n\nTo make this a more comprehensive list, we have combined our raw data with raw data from the study done in 2023 by Defend Our Health. As you can see, the purpose behind this consumer study is designed to help you select a food product with lower amounts of phthalates.\n\nMamavation’s EPA-certified lab tested for the following phthalates. This is not a complete list of all the phthalates that are allowed to be present as an indirect food additive according to the FDA, however, this list goes above and beyond what is already restricted by the European Union or the State of California and mirrors what was tested in 2023 by Defend Our Health.\n\nDiethyl phthalate (DEP)\n\nDi-n-propyl phthalate (DPP)\n\nDiisobutyl phthalate (DIBP)\n\nDibutyl phthalate (DBP)\n\nDihexyl phthalate (DnHP)\n\nBenzyl butyl phthalate (BBP)\n\nDicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP)\n\nDiisononyl phthalate (DINP)\n\nDi-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP)\n\nDiisodecyl phthalate (DIDP)\n\nbis(2-Ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)\n\nDimethyl phthalate (DMP)\n\nBis(2-propylheptyl) Phthalate (DPHP)\n\nDidecyl phthalate (DDP)\n\nPete Myers, Chief Scientist at Environmental Health Sciences, Adjunct Professor of Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University, and Co-Author of Our Stolen Future had this to say: “The presence of individual types of phthalates in avocado oils is just a starting point. Scientific experts in endocrine disruption are deeply concerned about the simultaneous effect of the mixtures of phthalates present. In our samples, 91% tested had at least two phthalate types present, and 64% had at least three phthalates present. That’s not a good sign.”\n\nMamavation’s Raw Data on Phthalates in Avocado Oil\n\nAre You Kidding Me?

    "# Comprehensive Analyst Report on Kevala\n\n## Company Overview\n\nKevala is a Seattle-based workforce management startup founded in early 2020, focusing on improving the quality and accessibility of care in senior housing and skilled nursing communities through innovative scheduling and workforce management technologies. The company aims to revolutionize healthcare delivery by optimizing staff utilization and enhancing the overall resident experience. Kevala's platform integrates advanced scheduling, credential management, vendor management, and data-driven insights, making it the first in the industry to unify and optimize workforce management across various staff types, including full-time, part-time, and agency personnel [(Kevala, 2024)](https://www.kevala.care/blog/kevala-appoints-lauren-wilson-to-lead-ltc).\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### Executive Appointment\n\nOn August 1, 2024, Kevala appointed Lauren Wilson as Vice President and General Manager to lead its Senior Housing and Long-Term Care business segment. Wilson, a veteran with 20 years of experience in healthcare and senior housing, expressed her commitment to transforming care delivery for seniors, stating, \"We are not trying to be incrementally better than current tools; we aim to institute a sea change in the industry\" [(Kevala, 2024)](https://www.kevala.care/blog/kevala-appoints-lauren-wilson-to-lead-ltc). Todd Owens, CEO of Kevala, emphasized that Wilson's industry insights and relationships will guide both Kevala and its clients effectively [(Kevala, 2024)](https://www.kevala.care/blog/kevala-appoints-lauren-wilson-to-lead-ltc).\n\n### Strategic Partnerships\n\nKevala has recently integrated its platform with PointClickCare, a leading healthcare technology platform. This collaboration aims to enhance staffing decisions in skilled nursing facilities by utilizing real-time census and acuity data, thereby reducing reliance on agency labor and associated overtime costs. Todd Owens remarked, \"At Kevala, we believe that workforce management should be a strategic advantage, not a daily struggle\" [(Logan Wright, Investors Hangout, 2025)](https://investorshangout.com/revolutionizing-skilled-nursing-with-kevalas-new-integration-253706-/).\n\n## Product Overview\n\nKevala's workforce management software is designed specifically for senior housing and skilled nursing communities. The platform offers features such as:\n\n- **Centralized Scheduling**: Unifies scheduling across various staff types, capturing employee availability and preferences to align operational needs with staff welfare.\n- **Automation and Compliance**: Automates Payroll Based Journal (PBJ) reporting, enabling nursing facilities to submit accurate compliance reports to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services [(Logan Wright, Investors Hangout, 2025)](https://investorshangout.com/revolutionizing-skilled-nursing-with-kevalas-new-integration-253706-/).\n- **Data-Driven Insights**: Provides real-time data to enhance staffing decisions, ultimately improving care quality and reducing costs [(Logan Wright, Investors Hangout, 2025)](https://investorshangout.com/revolutionizing-skilled-nursing-with-kevalas-new-integration-253706-/).\n\n## Market Position and Scale\n\nKevala is positioned at the intersection of HR tech and healthcare, with a mission to revolutionize healthcare costs and quality through smart workforce management. The company is venture-backed, indicating a strong financial foundation for growth and innovation. However, specific revenue figures and employee counts have not been disclosed in the available sources.\n\n## Industry Context\n\nThe healthcare industry is increasingly recognizing the importance of integrated solutions for workforce management. The demand for such solutions is driven by the need for efficiency and compliance in staffing, particularly in skilled nursing facilities. Kevala's integration with PointClickCare reflects a broader trend towards customized, integrated solutions in healthcare technology [(Logan Wright, Investors Hangout, 2025)](https://investorshangout.com/revolutionizing-skilled-nursing-with-kevalas-new-integration-253706-/).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nKevala is a promising player in the healthcare technology space, particularly in workforce management for senior housing and skilled nursing facilities. With recent executive appointments and strategic partnerships, the company is well-positioned to drive significant changes in how care is delivered to seniors. Prospective candidates and investors should consider Kevala's innovative approach and commitment to transforming the industry as key factors in their decision-making process. \n\nFor more information, visit [Kevala's official website](http://www.kevala.care)."
