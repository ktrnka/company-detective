Kevala is committed to adhering to all these applicable Data Protection laws.\n\nâ\n\nâPersonal dataâ â this is information we collect from you or about you and which is defined in the GDPR as âany information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.â It can be as simple as your name or your email, or something more complicated like an online identifier (usually a string of letters and / or numbers) that gets attached to you. Under PIPEDA and the CCPA, the equivalent concept is âpersonal information,â which is roughly the same. Any mention of âpersonal dataâ in this Policy shall also mean personal information.\n\n2. The Kevala Platform\n\nWe build a range of services for employees and organizations to change the healthcare industry for the better. Our services include:\n\nThe community platform that we offer at our website (www.kevala.care and local variants) is referred to as the âSite(s).â\n\nKevalaâs Sites, applications and related services, information and communications are collectively referred to as the âKevala Platform.â\n\nâ\n\nOrganizational account information\n\nSome experiences and services within the Kevala Platform allow organizations to interact with employees and employees to interact with organizations. If a user is granted access to an organization, the owner of the organization or a designated administrator may control and administer details of your account. For example, deciding your access rights, making decisions about your personal information, or requiring you to take certain actions. If your access rights are amended by the owner or designated administrator, then you may lose access to the information that is in the control of the organization.\n\nâ\n\nYour use of the Kevala Platform as part of an organizationâs account may be subject to the organizationâs policies, which may be different from this Statement. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other organizations, and you should consider both the organization's policies and whether you are comfortable enabling the organization with access to your information prior to connecting to their services.\n\n3.

I'm looking to get something like [ShiftMed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shiftmed.caregiverapp&hl=en_US&gl=US) or [CareRev](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.carerevolutions.carerev&hl=en_US&gl=US). I can't find anything like it, the closest I can get to is [Connecteam](https://connecteam.com/), but it seems more like a full staffing kind of thing not meant for tempoary staff. I assume something like ShiftMed or CareRev is created by developers just for that company, we are small so we don't have that kind of money. We still use paper timesheets and everything is a bit old school calling everywhere. \n\nThank you!\n\n\n\n## Comment ID jsgnlge with +2 score by [(Robotic_Phoenix123, Reddit, 2023-07-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/15308zx/employee_scheduling_software_for_medical_staffing/jsgnlge/) (in reply to ID 15308zx):\n1. what are the key features you are looking for?\n2. number of users\n3. webapp (mobile PWA) / mobile app (like playstore / appstore)\n\n### Comment ID jsgqa2s with +2 score by [(Pressure_Livid, Reddit, 2023-07-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/15308zx/employee_scheduling_software_for_medical_staffing/jsgqa2s/) (in reply to ID jsgnlge):\n1. We need a timesheet tracking feature that includes a signature feature to verify they worked those facilities with a facility supervisor. Connecteam is the only app I see so far that includes a signature verification. We also want nurses to claim their own shifts, like CareRev.\n\n\n2. We can have anywhere from 20 to 100 nurses depending on the season.\n\n3. I think we are looking for more of a mobile app, but I haven't looked into a pwa to see if that would fit us.\n\n## Comment ID jshbirt with +2 score by [(webdevfe, Reddit, 2023-07-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/15308zx/employee_scheduling_software_for_medical_staffing/jshbirt/) (in reply to ID 15308zx):\nGoogle Sheets\n\n## Comment ID jshk4ak with +2 score by [(Jcbrb5, Reddit, 2023-07-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/15308zx/employee_scheduling_software_for_medical_staffing/jshk4ak/) (in reply to ID 15308zx):\nWhat is your budget for this kind of software?

In addition to a signature, you can customize that form with other text and fields. You can also mark shifts as open, but it won't allow them to assign themselves. A manager/scheduler would have to do it, but at least all communication can happen within the app.",

(A Franciscan/VM hospital in Western WA) they get anywhere from $15-$18 PER HOUR bonuses often. Does anyone else want to share about bonuses at their hospitals? I am in home care right now making $19 at my over the table job, and $25 at my under the table job. But I am interested in switching to a hospital for benefits and 3 12s instead of working 5 days a week... I was gonna get hired at a Multicare hospital in January but they were only offering $17.75 per hour and for the drive I didn't want to take the pay cut. But yes....tell me about bonuses at your hospitals. And how common they are.\n\n## Comment ID inntdgu with +10 score by [(Accidentalmom, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cna/comments/x9fe00/hospital_bonuses/inntdgu/) (in reply to ID x9fe00):\nI make 15 an hour base but pick up an extra shift a week. An extra 12 hour shift is a $600 bonus plus double overtime which usually amounts to almost $1k.

Based on three key factors: \n\n* A set of high material quality-of-life indicators coinciding  with moderate per-capita incomes, both distributed across nearly the  entire population of Kerala.\n* A set of wealth and resource redistribution programmes that have  largely brought about the high material quality-of-life indicators.\n* High levels of political participation and activism among ordinary  people along with substantial numbers of dedicated leaders at all  levels. Kerala's mass activism and committed cadre were able to function  within a largely democratic structure, which their activism has served  to reinforce.\n\nKerala's unusual socioeconomic and demographic situation was summarized by author and environmentalist [Bill McKibben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_McKibben):\n\n>Kerala, a state in India, is a bizarre anomaly among developing  nations, a place that offers real hope for the future of the Third  World. Though not much larger than Maryland, Kerala has a population as  big as California's and a per capita annual income of less than $300.   But its infant mortality rate is very low, its literacy rate among the  highest on Earth, and its birthrate below America's and falling faster.   Kerala's residents live nearly as long as Americans or Europeans.   Though mostly a land of paddy-covered plains, statistically Kerala  stands out as the Mount Everest of social development; there's truly no  place like it.\n\nI'm surprised I haven't seen it cited by more socialists and communists, since these policies were first created by a communist named EMS.

Racist memes about street shitting in India are easily countered by demonstrating that it is communists who ended this. \n\nHowever, we shouldn't be dishonest: Kerala is at best a social democracy that is also financed a lot through remittances from Indian guest workers in the UAE and Saudi-Arabia. This is nothing the CPI(M) should be blamed for, as far as I can see it, they are still a revolutionary party, but they are doing what they can within in the constraints of an Indian state, but at least they're doing a much better job than the neoliberal hellscape that is imposed on the rest of India by the BJP.\n\n### Comment ID fgldhqe with +1 score by [(hungarian_conartist, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgldhqe/) (in reply to ID fgizv5e):\n>because it proves that a communist party is actually electable and doesn't immediately cause a famine or whatever when in power.\n\nNo it doesn't.

As background, I'm an American-born Indian who visits Kerala every year or so to see my relatives. Here are my observations. \n\nFirst, if you visit the area, you'll find scores of unemployed or underemployed men and women. \n\nSecond, the young people of Kerala (excepting those who are not particularly highly-educated and home-bodies) by and large seek to immigrate to the West for higher education; most do not come back. The region is experiencing a brain and talent drain. This is not sustainable in the twenty-first century.\n\nThird, starting a small business in the area is exceedingly difficult, as worker strikes, power outages, and labor shortages pose significant challenges to successful operation. \n\nFourth, many multinational corporations are hesitant about investing in the state given these conditions. \n\nFifth, many parts of Kerala would be considered risky for women to walk alone in, even during the daylight, as there is, unfortunately, a large contingent of unemployed men who seemingly have nothing better to do than make women feel uncomfortable; when my wife and I visited Kerala last January, she experienced this. \n\nSixth, and this is my anecdotal observation, alcoholism is a chronic problem in many households as the men do not have steady and sufficient employment. \n\nSeventh, if you ask Kerala expats who live in the United States whether they would ever go back and live in Kerala, the answer will virtually always be no. I asked my father if he would go back to Kerala, and while he occasionally makes statements about returning to the old country (which men of a certain generation do, I suppose), he would never follow through on this, a position held by many ex-Keralites. In my dad's words, even making minimum wage in America at Wal-Mart, while not ideal, would be better by sheer virtue of being in America. The safety-net in Kerala is only one in name and does not guarantee any upward mobility. At least in America, one can use the safety-net to move forward. In fact, this is what my parents, both of whom are Kerala expats, did in the 1980s. Their American success story is literally impossible to achieve in Kerala.\n\nSo yes, high literacy is great, but let us not be deluded into thinking that Kerala is a great success story. It is doing better than other parts of India, which is important, but this misses the existential and spiritual crisis one feels upon landing at the airport there. Everytime I go back, I thank God my parents had the foresight to leave before my siblings and I were born.\n\nEdit: added clarifying details and organization.\n\n### Comment ID fgj01ue with +27 score by [(XasthurWithin, Reddit, 2020-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgj01ue/) (in reply to ID fgiy34y):\nThat you don't have international corporations and constant labour strikes isn't necessarily a bad thing.\n\nHow is Kerala compared to the rest of India?\n\n#### Comment ID fgj0jmu with +22 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgj0jmu/) (in reply to ID fgj01ue):\nMost of his point can hardly be linked to the \"model\" in my uninformed opinion\n\n#### Comment ID fgj1l8q with +18 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgj1l8q/) (in reply to ID fgj01ue):\nFirst, I would challenge your assumption that not having international corporations and having constant labor strikes is fine. \n\n**Multinational companies provide streams of capital.** These companies build factories, invest in job-training centers, support educational facilities, and create incentives for local government to attract better talent. Without these incentives, a government bureaucrat tends to look at local problems through the lens of \"good enough,\" as in \"these roads are good enough for us, why invest in paving them\" or \"these power cuts are fine, there aren't any factories depending on them.\"\n\n**Multinational corporations provide local employment.** If you step outside of the developed world for a moment, the average person works in an agriculture-related position. Almost 70% of the jobs found in the poorest countries of the world are based on this industry, compared to less than 5% which is located in the wealthiest nations in the world. Multinationals come in, offer higher wages (which are still low compared to global standards), then shift the standard of living. The average real wages have almost tripled since 2018 in the developing and emerging G20 countries since 2008. For example, India had the highest levels, achieving an index rating of 5.5 compared to the regional 3.7 average.\n\n**Multinational corporations help incentive improving the local infrastructure.** Similar to discussion from the first point, companies must have employees who can access job sites to become productive. That means an investment in the local infrastructure becomes necessary before operations even begin. Roads, bridges, and technology access are three of the largest barriers taken down when multinationals become active in a developing country. You’ll see education investments to improve labor skills, along with public transportation development and other unique needs that some nations may require. In Kerala, the shoddy infrastructure means that a major car company like Toyota would never come because power cuts and outages would be significantly disruptive to the regional supply chain. \n\n**Multinational corporations help diversify local economies.** Many parts of India rely on primary products for subsistence. These products tend to be related to agriculture-based industries. Multinationals provide the economies of regions in the developing world with more variety, creating diversity in local production levels. That reduces reliance on commodities which often have volatile prices because their supply and demand levels waiver so often.\n\nHappy to discuss this further, but these are the thoughts that immediately come to my mind regarding your first sentence. Yes, multinationals aren't perfect, and we can certainly list ways in which multinationals aren't great for the developing world. But, on the whole, they tend to be better than they aren't. \n\nKerala is slightly ahead of India in some areas, but to call it a success story is like saying a car with three flat tires is significantly better than a car with four flat tires. In my opinion, Kerala's story is tragic because, whereas other parts of India have lower literacy and higher infant mortality, those highly-literate Keralites leave home and never come back. Accordingly, the population demographics of Kerala have, and will continue to, become older and older. Again, this is not sustainable. Anecdotally, I would say Kerala has maybe twenty years left before it becomes like any other under-developing state in India.\n\n#### Comment ID fgkgzwv with +3 score by [(ReckingFutard, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgkgzwv/) (in reply to ID fgj01ue):\nIts unemployment rate is way above average.\n\n#### Comment ID fglcebn with +1 score by [(hungarian_conartist, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fglcebn/) (in reply to ID fgj01ue):\nKeralan economy is reliant on remittances from the young supporting parents by working overseas in the west or places like Saudi Arabia.

But it's not as great as often represented.\n\n**Low entrepreneurship**\n\nThe model is practically set to not reward risk taking behaviour such as entrepreneurship. In the short run, this doesn't make much difference. In the long run, this is severely detrimental to growth.\n\n**Low business friendliness**\n\nMultinational companies are less willing to invest in Kerala. Not surprising, since the govt does not have very friendly policy for businesses. So they invest in other places - Hyderabad, Bangalore, Delhi etc. \n\n**High brain drain**\n\nThis ties into the above two. If people don't have new and exciting avenues to work in, they leave. Kerala has one of the highest expat populations. A state that leaks resources like that will not continue this for long.\n\nThen there's the fact that there are a lot of other factors at play that you have ignored. \nIt is true that Kerala has a moderately rich populace. But it is also true that Kerala is a thin state on a sea shore, by which I mean to say that almost all the state has access to the sea, which automatically means greater prosperity. If it were land locked and had a similar accomplishment, now that would be quite a feat. A coastal state being richer than others, that's not really an anomaly. \n\n\nThen there's social reforms. Kerala boasts of a lot of social reformers, something the rest of India can not. This led to a breakdown of repressive social values.

Being a Keralite I can say we are far better in terms of healthcare and education. This success is not only attributed to communists but should be shared by the other non left parties as well. Even, Christian missionaries and other religious organisations  played a major role in the education and health sector. \n\nLast point is most of the income for kerala families comes from Middle East.

But now for what might be a bit of a hot take: new systems should never base themselves on any existent system, no matter how successful that system may be, at least not heavily. The circumstances in which systems come into being and function are always unique, and they can cause systems that would otherwise fail to be successful and systems that would otherwise be successful to fail. There are lessons to be learned from Kerala, and from Cuba, and Burkina Faso, and other countries. But using one as a model is dangerous business and individual examples of various systems in action are unreliable indicators of the viability of a certain method. I believe that we should be looking at Kevala, picking out individual pieces of the structure that work and applying them in turn. For the larger picture, we should be looking instead to the theory on which those successes are based, and how best they can be implemented in our unique situations.\n\n## Comment ID fgkhssb with +1 score by [(Leonidas391, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgkhssb/) (in reply to ID eyrn7s):\nKerala is a decent model for socialist policymaking in underdeveloped nations, but it offers little guidance for socialists operating in developed/developing nations.

And who says the existence of a few minor successes proves we should all do it anyway, even if you could find a few?\n\n---\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism_in_Kerala\n\n\n> The Communist Party in Kerala is unique because it has functioned under the conditions of a liberal democracy, relying on success in multi-party elections to remain in power. **Unlike many other communist governments, the Communist Party of India (CPI) in Kerala did not crush political dissent**. \n\nGreat. A different kind of Communist party.\n\n> CPI's 1957 constitution stated it would allow the existence of opposing parties after it had parliamentary majority. Party leaders, like Namboodiripad, did not like the idea of using military force to remain in power because it would reflect poorly on the CPI as a whole on a global stage. This reliance on the people's opinions created a benevolent communist government, but it also made it more difficult to enact radical reforms. **Therefore, the reforms of the CPI in Kerala were mainly moderately socialist.**\n\nMaybe not Communist at all.\n\n---\n\n> **Agrarian reform**         \nOne of the major changes advocated by the CPI was the Agrarian Relations Bill, passed in 1961. The bill was intentionally moderate because those drafting it knew it would have to pass through many constitutional channels before it would be made into a law. Over 1,000 amendments were debated due to party divisions. **Though the bill was moderate, it still changed the farming system. It abolished feudalism and aimed to create a   \n ---> capitalist <---   \nagricultural system. The CPI did not push more radical Communist land reforms. Namboodiripad stated they would not attempt state ownership or collective farms because even though such ideas might appeal to intellectuals on a scientific basis, they would not actually help the peasantry in practice**. \n\nYes! They are not typical Communist morons and they know Marxist pseudo-intellectuals are full of shit.\n\n> The bill aimed to improve wages and working conditions as well as secure employment. Landlords were only allowed to work on their land if they paid compensation, which helped protect the tenants’ rights.\n\n---\n\n> **Industrial reform**       \n> As the CPI in Kerala was ultimately controlled by the federal government, its state plan depended on the funds it could raise independently. It struggled to industrialize and develop new manufacturing plants in Kerala throughout the 1960s while balancing out the disparities of industrialization. The CPI had Industries ministers who were responsible for industrial development. It also had an Industrial Development Cooperation that gave financial assistance to companies to help them startup new manufacturing projects. In the early 1970s, the CPI created two new corporations to help with industrial development: the Kerala Industrial and Technical Consultancy Organization and the Kerala State Electronics Development Corporation. These measures improved industry on a state level, but were less successful at the local level. **To revitalize local industry, the CPI launched an ambitious Four-Year Plan, perhaps modeling itself after Stalin's Five-Year Plans which Namboodiripad considered an inspiration. The Four-Year Plan involved district-level conventions to excite potential entrepreneurs since the government wanted more private investors to spur industry. These entrepreneurs were trained to set up their own industries. The plan was hugely successful within the first 6 weeks and managed to set up eleven new industrial estates, but then lagged as the program continued.**\n\nIt seems the government in Kerala calls itself Communist and wide eyed innocents like you and your sources believe it, but they are actually pursuing moderate policies. \n\nCiting Stalin's five year plan is odd, but their actual plan was exactly the opposite of Stalin's. It was **\"to excite entrepreneurs since the government wanted more private investors to spur industry (!!!).\"**  while Stalin wanted to crush entrepreneurs to concentrate all power in the hands of the party, the stupidest policy ever.\n\n### Comment ID fgiy7fq with +5 score by [(SternerStirner, Reddit, 2020-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgiy7fq/) (in reply to ID fgivweq):\n........You say that buddy is looking for a successful Socialist government then proceed to say that Kerala isn't Communist, it's Moderate Communist, which is Socialist, in ideological terms not internal Commie terms.

I had an instructor a while back bark at us about ego and how we need to control it. She then proceeded to correct everyone’s poses in the class that she felt were not aligned correctly because their “ego” was pushing them too far. \n\nI have issues with not being confident enough and putting other people before me and here she was lecturing me that “ego” was my problem. It was so clear that it was her issue and the fact that she was going around and trying to tell everyone how to practice was the most massive ego trip of all. I did not return to her class. I just want to hide in the back and practice the way I want 🤷‍♀️\n\n#### Comment ID kqgc2ed with +5 score by [(exsanguinatrix, Reddit, 2024-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqgc2ed/) (in reply to ID kqeg99f):\nI feel this in my soul.

Conforming to social expectations, working a job that \"seems\" prestigious, successful. With yoga practice now you have more self awareness. Realizing all the things you believed you wanted are just what the environment told you, not necessarily your true desire. You're less driven by the ego. You dissolved the identities you attached yourself to. A husband, a provider, a successful worker. But after the letting go you haven't constructed a life based on this new awareness. It is confusing. This is time to be still. If you are able to not start another job so soon, take time to meditate and be in nature. Go explore. What is your Dharma? What is your heart felt desire?

You will never make money working for others. Money is not a goal I personally strive to make more of. As long as I can live a comfortable life,my bills are paid, I am happy. I find when you do something you love as a job, you don't work a day in yr life. Change is tough, but usually brings better things. I'd say go after whatever it is you love, for employment. Even if you are working for another you'll be much more fulfilled doing something you love\n\n## Comment ID kqfjh3a with +1 score by [(nomarenamata, Reddit, 2024-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqfjh3a/) (in reply to ID 1aqcn4y):\nPTSD and anxiety from mobbing pushed me to quit a job that always felt meaningless to me. Luckily it allowed me to save enough so I can buy some time and get trained on what I actually want to do. \nI come from a completely different background but I understand the sentiment.\n\n## Comment ID kqgjyr8 with +1 score by [(spicy_fairy, Reddit, 2024-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqgjyr8/) (in reply to ID 1aqcn4y):\nyeeeep exact same thing happened to me that was congruent with my yoga practice. deleted social media other than reddit, limit who i spend time with/talk to, am more mindful of what content i consume, etc. this happened during the pandemic for me.\n\n## Comment ID kqgo3e4 with +1 score by [(WickedWiscoWeirdo, Reddit, 2024-02-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kqgo3e4/) (in reply to ID 1aqcn4y):\nIv noticed a significant difference in the month that iv been practicing, but it's sorta the culmination of many things all coming together at once\n\n## Comment ID kr8vko6 with +1 score by [(RequirementFit1128, Reddit, 2024-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1aqcn4y/has_anyones_personality_changed_dramatically/kr8vko6/) (in reply to ID 1aqcn4y):\nTo thrive, man needs purpose and meaning. The rat race, especially in finance, always keeps moving the goalposts. It feels like you're never achieving anything. Plus, it's an incredibly materialistic and competitive environment. Maybe that's not what gives you purpose and meaning.\n\n\nPeople who find purpose and meaning in their work are always happier. I encourage you to seek out what is more meaningful to you.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can continue in your career, but to realize that you don't find purpose and meaning in it, and with that realization, categorize it a simply a livelihood, and seek out purpose and meaning in other activities."

      "# [DER interconnection: 5 takeaways from the IREC Vision Summit 2023 by Paul Gerke on 2023-11-15](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/solar/der-interconnetion-5-takeaways-from-the-irec-vision-summit-2023/)\n(Minneapolis, MN) – In the words of Danish theologian Søren Kierkegaard: “Life can only be understood backward, but it must be lived forwards.”\n\nIt’s easy enough to identify shortcomings in an electrical grid one hundred years in the making; it’s not as simple to find solutions. That’s why it’s sometimes best to work in groups!\n\nSome of the brightest minds in the industry gathered in Minneapolis, Minnesota for the Interstate Renewable Energy Council Vision 2023 Summit. Over the course of several moderated sessions and fireside chats, IREC’s assemblage presented ideas and practices that will shape the future of DER interconnection. Here are some key takeaways:\n\n1. We need more engineers\n\nIf there’s an aimless student near and dear to your heart, perhaps it’s a good idea to push them toward the engineering field. Stakeholders across sectors lamented the lack of young, qualified engineers to put on projects. There isn’t staff to regularly update hosting maps, interconnection queues can’t be evaluated even remotely quickly, and not enough people understand systems once they are online.\n\n“Utilities are not classically staffed and equipped for this,” explained Rory Christian, chair and CEO of the New York State Public Service Commission.\n\n“We process more than 10,000 applications every year,” added Pearl Donohoo-Vallett, Ph.D., a senior strategy manager for utility Pepco Holdings, who suggested the need for an interconnection workforce. “That’s a lot for a small engineering staff.\n\n“These are fundamental changes in the utility business. The business transformation that is needed is enormous. If we want it to be good and fast, utilities need to build the tools and teams to collectively get things on the system a lot faster. “\n\n“I see the challenge mainly in human capital,” concurred Mahmoud Kabalan, the founding director of the Center for Microgrid Research at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. “We don’t have enough engineers comfortable to run microgrids. It’s very much an ongoing learning experience.”\n\n2. Transparency is essential to smooth interconnection\n\nStephen Mariani, who works for the Public Utilities Commission of Hawai’i, was one of many speakers frustrated by challenges collecting data.\n\n“Utilities need to be incentivized to provide transparency and information,” agreed Utopia Hill, CEO at Reactivate.\n\nJulieta Giraldez, director of grid planning at Kevala, called lack of transparency the biggest challenge facing distribution interconnection. “Good data is the backbone of being able to accomplish these goals. We only cared about the peak before. It’s not the same now,” she said. “The ability to use and understand time series data, while pushing for better quality data, is essential. Otherwise, we will be stuck with more conservative screens.”\n\nAny data that’s being used to prospect and ultimately commission a project will have to be frequently updated, too. Mark Esguerra of Southern California Edison hopes automation and AI will speed up wait times. “How do we streamline the intake of interconnection to help prevent long queues?” He wondered. “My spider senses went up when I heard capacity maps being updated.”\n\n“Things are changing very fast. Developers want to know the status today, in 12 months, in 24 months,” Giraldez of Kevala added. “I think we have made great progress with hosting capacity maps but we have to understand it’s a dynamic concept. Every time you change the load and configuration, the results change. How do we make this information more useful?”\n\nKatie Kienbaum, an author at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, is trying to get access to information that will help make interconnection more equitable. “Having good, publicly available data is essential to learning where these inequities exist and to hold utilities and regulators responsible,” she said.\n\nSAVE THE DATE! The next edition of the GridTECH Connect Forum will be held in Orlando, Florida on February 26, 2024. We’re bringing together developers, utilities, and regulators to take on the critical issue of DER interconnection in the Southeast. Register to secure your seat today.\n\n3. The rules need changing\n\nMinnesota estimates it will take around 200 years to process the interconnection applications in its queue. As Danish theologian Søren Kierkegaard almost certainly did not say: “Ain’t nobody got time for that.”\n\n“Interconnection rules didn’t keep pace with policymakers’ interests,” explained David Gahl, executive director of the Solar and Storage Industries Institute, the think tank arm of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) trade group. “Those rules need to catch up and we need to improve our processes. We need to move faster to catch up with regulators and policymakers’ intent.”\n\n“If I could wave a magic wand and say we are gonna update the 100-year-old regulatory contract and make DERs a core service of utilities, great! That’s not gonna happen overnight,” laughed Brad Klein, senior attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center. “I hope we get there. There’s work around the edges.”\n\n“The fundamental policy framework is based on stuff done in 2006. It was developed for a different time and a different world,” he continued. “That framework treats connecting DERs as a novelty, extraneous to the utility. They should pay for it, it’s only going to benefit them, and the utility will treat it as a one-off. But today, that’s completely at odds with our goals. We recognize a decentralized energy future.”\n\n“We must continue to improve the screens and the process but it won’t matter until we change the core assumptions around our framework.”\n\nRenewable energy attorney Sky Stanfield likened our current grid policy to the bones of a single-family home. “We are trying to put a skyscraper over it. Instead of a foundation, it’s an extra support beam here, a little plaster there… It’s time for us to take a look at if the basic foundation will be able to support what we need to do. I think it is not.”\n\n4. The new grid will be a more standardized and equitable one\n\nInconsistency seems to be among the only consistencies when it comes to interconnection state-to-state. Shoring up access to information, modernizing methods, and standardizing as many processes as possible will be essential as we address inequities in access to renewables.\n\n“The application process is a black hole,” said Adrian Davis, co-founder of Prime Partners Engineering. “The interconnection process is really confusing.”\n\n“It’s very challenging for developers to locate assets to support the grid if we don’t have clarity,” detailed Hill. “It’s literally a black box. There’s no consistency. Every interconnection application process varies. Some places still have Excel. Others use e-mails. Some still want wet signatures.”\n\n“We need standardizations and certification at a higher level so they can just plug and play,” added Southern California Edison’s Esguerra, who believes some of the challenge is that technology is moving quicker than we can certify its effectiveness.\n\n“It’s tough to gauge the difference between disinterest and distrust.”\n\n-Shay Banton, regulatory program engineer and energy justice policy advocate at IREC\n\nBringing lower-to-middle-income areas on board will be a tough task in some places, warned a panel on interconnection equity. Shay Banton, a regulatory program engineer and energy justice policy advocate for IREC, fears establishing trust will be difficult in overlooked communities.\n\nDavis wants to ensure LMI communities have access to technical support, as they’re often submitting one-time applications, unlike large developers navigating interconnection frequently.\n\n“When we are going out to interconnect in these communities, it’s the oldest infrastructure. People aren’t predicting disadvantaged communities to have resources- the money is being spent elsewhere,” said Hill. “It creates a red line in the grid, and we can’t have that.”\n\n5. Microgrids might not be a silver bullet, but they’ll do in a pinch\n\nWhen Hurricanes Maria and Irma devastated Puerto Rico’s electrical systems, microgrids saved lives in the aftermath. Nonprofits assisted communities in uniting behind solar and storage to provide a lifeline for critical services. Now we’re figuring out how similar setups can keep vital community centers online in emergencies stateside.\n\n“A lot of folks in Puerto Rico have changed their relationship with the energy system,” detailed IREC program director Carlos Alberto Velazquez Lopez, who leads the organization’s efforts on the island. “You used to receive a bill at the end of the month and wait for it to happen again. After Maria people started to ask where it comes from. How can I generate locally? How can I make sure the lights stay on?”\n\n“You will find such a high-energy IQ there now,” he continued. “People can tell you about batteries, how to reduce consumption. It’s fascinating, from children to older adults. What happened in Puerto Rico is terrible but what’s happening now is a very positive sign.”\n\nPODCAST: Scale Microgrid Solutions co-founder and COO Tim Hade joined Episode 34 of the Factor This! podcast to discuss scaling a cleantech hardware company, microgrids, and the role of distributed energy resources in the energy transition. Subscribe wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nVelazquez Lopez sees an opportunity for LMI communities to take ownership of energy and storage and teach energy literacy through outreach, instead of waiting for disaster.\n\nIn the short term, there appears to be an excellent use case for microgrids in places like critical care facilities, argued Weston Dengler of Smart Electric Power Alliance. “They are a tool in the tool kit. They are increasingly being proven. They will be a piece; the definition of the idea that the grid is no longer top down, it’s middle out.”\n\n“Microgrids are an example of what the grid of the future will look like, this grid of grids,” agreed OurEnergy CEO Dustin Jolley. “These are simply the early stage projects of a complete overhaul of our grid and the infrastructure it operates under.”\n\n“The missing piece is energy storage,” warned Kabalan, who is set to power five campus buildings with a microgrid of his own. “We don’t do that efficiently or economically yet. But if we figure that out in ten to twenty years, microgrids might be in everybody’s homes.”",

      "# [Avocado Oils Tested for Phthalates — Buying Guide by Leah Segedie on 2024-08-06](https://www.mamavation.com/food/avocado-oils-tested-for-phthalates-buying-guide.html)\nWhich avocado oils have the least toxic phthalate contamination? Phthalates are hormone-disrupting chemicals in plastics & fragrances that find their way into many foods and personal care products. To solve this puzzle, Mamavation sent several of the most popular avocado oils off to an EPA-certified laboratory to test for several types of phthalates to find out. You’ve trusted Mamavation to cover topics like safest olive oils tested for phthalates, safest coconut oils tested for phthalates, safest salt sans heavy metals and microplastics, safest cookware without PFAS “forever chemicals” and nanoparticles, and safest water purifiers that filter PFAS, now join us for another consumer study on avocado oils and hormone-disrupting phthalates.\n\nDisclosure: This consumer study is released in partnership with Environmental Health News. Scientific reviews were performed by (1) Terrence Collins, Teresa Heinz Professor of Green Chemistry & Director of the Institute for Green Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University, (2) Linda S. Birnbaum, Scientist Emeritus and Former Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and National Toxicology Program & Scholar in Residence at Duke University, Adjunct Professor at the University of North Carolina, & Yale University, & (3) Pete Myers, Chief Scientist at Environmental Health Sciences, Adjunct Professor of Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University, and Co-Author of Our Stolen Future.

Copyright © 2024 Mamavation — All Rights Reserved\n\nPhthalates Found in Popular Avocado Oils\n\nMamavation’s EPA-certified laboratory found phthalates in 11 popular avocado oils. These chemicals are linked to serious health effects, which we will discuss later. Because phthalates are so problematic to hormones, Mamavation has commissioned our own scientific studies on phthalates in food products to make recommendations for the safest avocado oils. Continue reading Mamavation’s article on these products to find which brands have the lowest amounts of phthalates according to our laboratory.\n\nFor this consumer study, Mamavation sent 11 popular avocado oils from 11 brands to an EPA-certified laboratory looking for phthalates. Because Mamavation only tested one product per brand, we cannot claim to know if these issues are, in fact, industry-wide or portfolio-wide. However, based on our “spot-check” of the industry, this is what we found:\n\n100% of avocado oils analyzed by our laboratory had traces of phthalates. This is a total of 11 detections from 11 avocado oil products.\n\nRanges of phthalates were from 76 parts per billion (ppb) to 56,808 ppb. Based on the amounts presented, we created 4 categories to communicate levels of phthalates found: (1) Avocado oils with the most contamination (2) Avocado oils with still very high contamination, (3) Avocado oils with intermediate contamination, & (4) Avocado Oils with the least contamination. These categories are not based on health impacts. They are based on presenting data and where the middle ground lies in each category. We then added 2 results from Defend Our Health’s study on phthalates to give our audience more variety in choices.\n\n9% of Avocado oil products had over 20,000 ppb phthalates. That’s 1 bottle out of 11 avocado oils. We dubbed this the “Are You Kidding Me?” realm, which would have the highest amount of phthalates.\n\n18% of Avocado oil products had between 2,000 ppb and 20,000 phthalates. That’s 2 out of 11 bottles of avocado oils over 2,000 ppb. We dubbed this the “Not Our Favorite Avocado Oils with High Contamination” realm.\n\n27% of avocado oil products had between 800 ppb and 2,000 ppb phthalates. That’s 3 out of 11 bottles of avocado oil between 800 ppb and 2,000 ppb. We dubbed this the “Better Avocado Oils with Intermediate Contamination” realm.\n\n45% of avocado oil products had less than 800 ppb phthalates. That’s 5 out of 11 bottles of avocado oil that had below 800 ppb. We dubbed this the “Best Avocado Oils with Least Contamination” realm.\n\nIf you are using avocado oil to prepare meals for your family or as personal care, this investigation will be very important to follow to reduce your family’s exposure to phthalates. However, as you can see, every avocado oil manufacturer whose products Mamavation studied has work to do to remove phthalates from their products. None of the avocado oils that were tested by Mamavation or by Defend Our Health had zero detections of phthalates.\n\nPhthalates are typically found inside plastics and in undisclosed fragrances. When in plastics, they work to make the plastic more flexible. When they are in fragrances, they help carry the scent longer in the air. These chemical contaminants are found in many types of products that are involved in the food service industry like food service gloves, tubing used in dairy operations, hoses, holding tanks, and conveyor belts inside manufacturing plants. In fact, there are so many places where phthalates can show up because they are legal indirect food additives used in manufacturing for both conventional AND organic foods. There is some movement to restrict some ortho-phthalate chemicals from food packaging but not from manufacturing in general.\n\nLinda S. Birnbaum, Scientist Emeritus and Former Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and National Toxicology Program & Scholar in Residence at Duke University, Adjunct Professor at the University of North Carolina & at Yale University had this to say about the study after her review: “Phthalates cause multiple adverse health effects, including developmental effects in the reproductive system and neurotoxicity. There is also evidence for causing cancer in laboratory animals.”\n\nTypes of Phthalates Found in Our Avocado Oil Study\n\nOur laboratory found five different types of phthalates in the coconut oil we sent to them. Here’s a brief breakdown of each one.\n\nDi-2-ethylhexyl Phthalate (DEHP): DEHP is a highly toxic endocrine disruptor. It was also the most common phthalate found by our lab and is found commonly in building products (wallpaper, wire, and cable insulation), clothing (footwear, raincoats), car products, food packaging, medical devices, and children’s products (toys, grip bumpers). This chemical is also on California’s Prop. 65 list of carcinogens and reproductive toxicants. In addition, it’s been linked to endocrine disruption, reproductive issues, developmental issues, liver & kidney toxicity, asthma & allergies, & thyroid problems.\n\nDiisodecyl phthalate (DIDP): Found commonly in PVC plastics, artificial leather, toys, carpet backing, covering on wires and cables, and pool liners. This chemical is also on California’s Prop. 65 list of carcinogens and reproductive toxicants. It’s associated with health concerns including liver & kidney toxicity, developmental issues, endocrine disruption, reproductive issues, asthma & allergies, & thyroid problems.\n\nBis(2-propylheptyl) Phthalate (DPHP): This type of phthalate is a substitute for other high molecular weight phthalates used primarily for high-temperature applications such as cable wires, roofing membranes, and food containers. It is used to soften plastics and is a general-use plasticizer under investigation as an endocrine disruptor. This phthalate is associated with additional health concerns like reproductive toxicity, prenatal, perinatal, & post-natal toxicity, and genotoxicity.\n\nDi-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP): This type of phthalate is a colorless, odorless, oily liquid that doesn’t evaporate easily used to keep plastics soft or more flexible. It is used for medical tubing and blood storage bags, wire and cables, carpetback coating, floor tile, adhesives, cosmetics, and pesticides. Animal studies have demonstrated increased fetal malformations and reduced body weights of offspring. DnOP comprises about 20% of commercial C6-10 phthalate mixtures used in flooring and carpet tiles, tarps, pool liners, and garden hoses. DnOP is approved by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) as an indirect food additive which is typically used in manufacturing as seam cements, bottle cap liners, and conveyor belts. DNOP are classified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as priority environmental pollutants.\n\nDibutyl phthalate (DBP): This type of phthalate is an organic compound commonly used as a plasticizer, and as an additive to\n\nadhesives or printing inks. It usually is a colorless oil, but can have a yellow color. Use of this substance in cosmetics, such as in nail polishes, is banned in the European Union. DBP is one of the six phthalic acid esters found on the Priority Pollutant List regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Animal studies have observed that DBP is toxic to fetal development. This phthalate is associated with additional health concerns like reproductive toxicity, prenatal, perinatal, & post-natal toxicity, and genotoxicity.\n\nDiisononyl phthalate (DINP): This type of phthalate is used as a plasticizer. The European Union has set restrictions on this chemical inside food contact materials because of the determination that it’s problematic to human health. DINP is also listed on the California Prop. 65 list of carcinogens and reproductive toxicants.\n\nAdditional Studies Finding Phthalates in Cooking Oils\n\nAnother scientific report co-authored by our friends at Defend Our Health published in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology found phthalates in a range of popular children’s foods and organic products in 2023. Included in this report were 2 avocado oils.\n\nMamavation took the results from this report and added it to our list of recommendations at the bottom of this post for your review, which was two additional results. However, all coconut oils, olive oils, & avocado oils tested by Defend Our Health also had trace amounts of phthalates. It’s not so much a question of whether there are phthalates present in coconut oils, olive oils, & avocado oils. It’s a matter of what levels are present. Both of our studies confirmed that these cooking oils have different levels of phthalates present.\n\nView our consumer study on olive oils here.\n\nView our consumer study on coconut oils here.\n\nPhthalates Have Specific Problematic Health Effects\n\nPhthalates are linked to many health effects from several studies on both animals and humans. This is very problematic because phthalates are linked with hormone disruption of the endocrine system, which regulates the body’s hormones, even in trace amounts in low concentrations. Epidemiological studies have revealed that exposure to phthalates adversely affects the level of hormones within the body, which can impact several important health functions. Here are some health effects phthalate exposure is linked to.\n\nWeight gain & obesity\n\nShorter height\n\nPrecocious puberty\n\nAsthma\n\nAllergies\n\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\n\nLower IQ\n\nSocial impairment\n\nType II diabetes and insulin resistance\n\nPoor cardiovascular health\n\nThyroid function and increased risk of thyroid cancer\n\nFemales: pregnancy loss and preterm birth, low birth weight, earlier menopause\n\nMales: genital development, semen quality, reduced “masculine” play, Inhibits testosterone production, Shortened anogenital distance, or shortened “taint” , Shortened length of penis\n\nTerrence Collins, Teresa Heinz Professor of Green Chemistry & Director of the Institute for Green Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University had this to say about the study during his scientific review: “An earlier Mamavation study found that olive oils are contaminated with phthalates. Now Mamavation is finding phthalates in avocado oils. Phthalates are anti-androgens—they disrupt male hormone action. Currently, highly chemicalized countries like America are experiencing a steady drop in male fertility, quantified through a population-level decline in mean sperm count and quality. Phthalate exposures are suspected of playing a role in the declines. Phthalate contamination of food oils is completely unacceptable! Like the olive oil manufacturers, the avocado oil manufacturers should begin acting to better protect their customers by thoroughly examining every aspect of their supply and manufacturing chains to ensure that all phthalates are eliminated. And then they should learn much more about endocrine disruption and become extremely diligent in producing products that are free of endocrine-disrupting chemicals. One has to wonder why the FDA appears to be asleep on the job.”\n\nHow are Phthalates Regulated in the Food Supply & Children’s Products?\n\nBecause phthalates are so problematic to human health, there are varying restrictions on products and food at the federal level. There is, however, no consistency among federal agencies to protect the public. For instance, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) restricts certain phthalates within children’s toys and childcare products. They prohibit the import and sale of those products that contain more than 0.1% of the following phthalates:\n\ndi-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)\n\ndibutyl phthalate (DBP)\n\nbenzyl butyl phthalate (BBP)\n\ndiisononyl phthalate (DINP)\n\ndiisobutyl phthalate (DIBP)\n\ndi-n-pentyl phthalate (DPENP)\n\ndi-n-hexyl phthalate (DHEXP)\n\ndicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP)\n\nEven though the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission restricted 8 ortho-phthalates in products intended for use by children, you still see some of the same chemicals approved as indirect additives by the FDA in the food supply even when those foods are marketed to children. Furthermore, the FDA denied a citizen petition in 2022 which demanded to take these phthalate chemicals out of the food supply because they impact the hormones of children.\n\nCalifornia also has some restrictions under the Prop. 65 list of Carcinogens and Reproductive Toxicants, requiring products sold over the limits to be accompanied by a warning. Any consumer living in California who tests and finds products with specific phthalate amounts outside the limits may bring a Prop. 65 lawsuit six months after serving the company with a public notification letter. However, be advised these limits are not enforceable. California’s “right to know” law is only about warning the consumer about the carcinogenic chemicals present. Therefore, California cannot force companies to recall products that are above these limits. Here are the phthalate-criteria:\n\nBBP – Maximum Allowable Dose Levels (MADL) 1,200 μg/day (oral)\n\nDBP – MADL 8.7 μg/day\n\nDIDP – MADL 2,200 μg/day\n\nDnHP – MADL 2,200 μg/day\n\nDEHP – No Significant Risk Level (NSRL) 310 μg/day (adult), MADL 4,200 μg/day (intravenous adult), MADL 600 (intravenous infant), MADL 410 ug/day (oral for adult), MADL 58 ug/day (oral for infant).\n\nDINP – NSRL 146 μg/day\n\nIn terms of avocado oils, it could be possible that the vast majority of phthalates are finding their way into the product during manufacturing, storage, or transportation. Under the Food & Drug Administration 21 CFR rules, FDA regulates food, drugs, cosmetics, and food contact materials within the United States. The FDA sanctioned the use of 25 plasticizers via an amendment to food additive regulations: 21 CFR Part 175 through 21 CFR Part 178. These regulations allow the use of phthalates in the food supply as “indirect food additives” that can be present. These chemicals can find their way into your food in many ways during manufacturing such as:\n\nAdhesives and components of coatings used in food contact materials.\n\nComponents of paper and paperboard, such as paperboard that is in contact with aqueous and fatty foods or used as a defoaming agent on the paperboard.\n\nAdjuvants, production aids, and sanitizers used in manufacturing.\n\nPlasticizers in polymeric substances, such as phthalates in plastic PVA or PVC sheets in food contact materials OR vinyl chloride homopolymers or copolymers used in food contact materials.\n\nSurface lubricants used to make metallic products.\n\nThe European Union has banned or restricted several phthalates such as DEHP, DBP, DIBP, and BBP in a wide range of products since 2020. These bans and restrictions include children’s swimming aids, flooring, coated fabrics and paper, recreational gear, mattresses, footwear, and office supplies, among other categories. These chemicals are not expected to be found in foods above certain thresholds. However, not all phthalates are restricted or tested for either.\n\nOther Categories of Products Mamavation Has Tested for Toxic Contaminants\n\nBefore we launch into the raw data from our lab, we wanted to remind you about all the other studies we have done on indications of PFAS “forever chemicals,” pesticides, & heavy metals inside the food and consumer products you may bring inside your home. Each one of these studies were done in a similar fashion as this study with brands sent independently to the certified lab and raw data of those labs at the bottom of the post.\n\nSoft Contact Lenses\n\nGreen Beauty Makeup\n\nLip Balm\n\nCondoms & Lubricants\n\nDental Floss\n\nToilet Paper\n\nTissue Paper\n\nPeriod Underwear\n\nTampons\n\nSanitary Pads, Pantiliners, & Incontinence Pads\n\nPowdered Electrolytes\n\nCinnamon\n\nSalt\n\nButter Wrappers\n\nPasta & Tomato Sauces\n\nNut Butters (Peanut butter, etc.)\n\nCoffee\n\nOlive oils\n\nCoconut oils\n\nKetchup\n\nActivewear (Yoga Pants)\n\nSports Bras\n\nParchment Paper\n\nCupcake Liners\n\nPlastic-Free Straws\n\nSandwich Baggies (Both plastic & more “sustainable” options)\n\nFast Food Packaging\n\nFurniture\n\nChildren’s Probiotics\n\nKids’ Backpacks\n\nBaby Strollers\n\nBaby Bottles\n\nMamavation’s Investigation of Avocado Oils & Phthalates\n\nFor this study, avocado oils were purchased between February 2023 and May 2024. Each product was recorded in our database and sent directly to the lab within its original packaging. Unfortunately, 100% of avocado oils tested had at least trace amounts of ortho-phthalates, a class of hormone-disrupting chemicals.\n\nTo make this a more comprehensive list, we have combined our raw data with raw data from the study done in 2023 by Defend Our Health. As you can see, the purpose behind this consumer study is designed to help you select a food product with lower amounts of phthalates.\n\nMamavation’s EPA-certified lab tested for the following phthalates. This is not a complete list of all the phthalates that are allowed to be present as an indirect food additive according to the FDA, however, this list goes above and beyond what is already restricted by the European Union or the State of California and mirrors what was tested in 2023 by Defend Our Health.\n\nDiethyl phthalate (DEP)\n\nDi-n-propyl phthalate (DPP)\n\nDiisobutyl phthalate (DIBP)\n\nDibutyl phthalate (DBP)\n\nDihexyl phthalate (DnHP)\n\nBenzyl butyl phthalate (BBP)\n\nDicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP)\n\nDiisononyl phthalate (DINP)\n\nDi-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP)\n\nDiisodecyl phthalate (DIDP)\n\nbis(2-Ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)\n\nDimethyl phthalate (DMP)\n\nBis(2-propylheptyl) Phthalate (DPHP)\n\nDidecyl phthalate (DDP)\n\nPete Myers, Chief Scientist at Environmental Health Sciences, Adjunct Professor of Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University, and Co-Author of Our Stolen Future had this to say: “The presence of individual types of phthalates in avocado oils is just a starting point. Scientific experts in endocrine disruption are deeply concerned about the simultaneous effect of the mixtures of phthalates present. In our samples, 91% tested had at least two phthalate types present, and 64% had at least three phthalates present. That’s not a good sign.”\n\nMamavation’s Raw Data on Phthalates in Avocado Oil\n\nAre You Kidding Me?

      "# [Rethinking Aging Club Thursday Alliance Rooms 2-3pm ET by Linda Sherman](https://boomertechtalk.com/rethinking-aging-club-thursday-alliance-rooms/)\nFollowing are event room names, dates and speakers for our Thursdays Age-Friendly Product Alliance. Each room name is tied to the LinkedIn event post, which includes a link to the replay, and event resources. Event co-hosts are usually Michael Phillips (AARP Tech), Steve Ewell (Consumer Technology Association Foundation), Rick Robinson (AgeTech Collaborative from AARP), Debbie Howard (Aging Matters International) and myself, Linda Sherman. Recently Carol Chiang (Evolving Homes) and Benjamin Surmi (Koelsch Communities) have been stepping in as co-host as well.\n\nTo return to the main Rethinking Aging Club recently updated Overview post please click here.\n\nSave the Date Coming Weekly Thursday Age-Friendly Product Alliance 2-3pm ET Events\n\nIf you are already a Member of our Rethinking Aging Club house, please RSVP from inside the house for upcoming events. Please note that 2-3pm ET is for Daylight Savings Time, we will return to 1-2pm ET November – March during Standard Time.\n\n10-10 Hearing Innovations with Charlotte Yeh\n\n11-21-24 Dementia Villages\n\nRoom Summaries\n\nIn June 2022, Debbie Howard began doing summaries of key speaker points at the end of each room. These are in the Clubhouse replay recordings and the podcasts. Rethinking Aging Club is now a podcast of these Thursday Age-Friendly Product Alliance shows. We are publishing our Rethinking Aging Club archives back to Nov 2021 by category until we catch up; with CES Highlights first, then Caregiver Friendly Products and Fitness and Wellness.\n\nIt will take us about six months to get all of the approximately 100 remaining shows published by category in our podcast. However, you can listen to all of them on the Clubhouse replays. Where there is a podcast recording we provide a link to that below.\n\nYou’ll see that each of our most recent shows (currently through May 2022) links to the LinkedIn show post with more information about the speakers and a link to the Clubhouse replay. Unfortunately LinkedIn started deprecating (removing) older posts. Where those are not available we are updating those to a link to a viable Clubhouse replay. Also the Clubhouse replay links in the older LinkedIn posts may be problematic so we have added Clubhouse replay information where it will be helpful. Ultimately the podcast links will solve all of this. And you can always go to our Rethinking Aging Club on Clubhouse and get all of the replays back to November 2021 in chron order.\n\nThursday Age-Friendly Product Alliance 2-3pm ET Archive Links with Speakers, Replays and Resources\n\n10-3 Aging Workforce Benefits\n\n* Sally Pace, CEO, Connect Healthcare Collaboration and Co-Creator The Granite\n\n* Stephanie Koch, SCP-SHRM, SPHR, CHVA, Director of Human Resources,Hendry Marine Industries\n\n* Madhavi Vemireddy MD, CEO, Cleo\n\n9-26-24 Fitness, Wellness and Self Care\n\n* Eric Levitan, CEO and Founder, VIVO, member AgeTech Collaborative from AARP\n\n* Dr. Krystal Culler, DBH, MA, Brain Health Expert and Founder, Virtual Brain Health Care Center\n\n* Andrea Beth Trank, Integrated Health Coach and Founder Heaven Lane Creations\n\n9-19-24 Falls Prevention\n\n* Hilik Harari, CEO GaitBetter, Member AgeTech Collaborative from AARP\n\n* Michael Wing, CEO and Co-Founder, Accelera.US\n\n8-29-24 Project Updates\n\n* David Bosnak, Founder & CEO Attune Media Labs, PBC – Empathic AI mental health support companions, MiM\n\n* Raphael Rubens, Founder MemoMate\n\n* Andy Liwen, CTO | Principal Investigator 1 True Health\n\n* Reiko Lewis, Founder Ventus Senior Concierge Service\n\n8-22-24 Living Choices – Housing Alternatives\n\n* Maureen Longoria, Co-Founder, LivNow Relocation\n\n* Mary Pitsch, Co-Founder/President, DementiaInnovations.org; Owner, EmbraceCareManagement.com\n\n* Carol Chiang, OTR/L, CAPS, ECHM, CHAMP, EvolvingHomes.com\n\n* Benjamin Surmi, Director Education and Culture, Koelsch Communities\n\n8-15-24 Wellness in order\n\n* Amy Li, Founder, Dance4Healing\n\n* Linda Sherman, MBET Health Miracle Professional Dressing – Miracle Bandage Plus\n\n* Debbie Howard, Founder, Aging Matters International – January Self-care Challenge\n\n8-8-24 Wellness in order\n\n* Ellen Khalifa, Tiny Habits Coach, Wellspan Expert\n\nPresenter for our weekly News for the Ages by Rethinking Aging Club\n\n* Elise Marie Collins, Gerontologist, Yoga Teacher, Author, and President of the Women’s National Book Association (WNBA) Co-host Your Mindset Mastery on Clubhouse\n\nWellness August 1, 2024\n\n* Sherri Snelling, CEO, Caregiving Club\n\n* Ellen MacKay, Program Manager, Yoga4Caregivers\n\nSelf-Care July 25, 2024\n\n* Deborah Harlow, Founder, The Joyful Leader\n\n* Carol Nace, Founder, Bodhi Ayurveda\n\n* Kathryn Speer Shoaf RN, BSN, ATP, Founder, Elite Cruises And Vacations LLC\n\nCaregiver Friendly Products July 18, 2024\n\n* David Carson, CEO, CareGlider\n\n* Christina ‘n Cindy Hardin-Weiss, Co-Founder, Adaptive Equipment & Caregiving Corner\n\n* Justin Lee, CEO and Founder, Quantum Senses – Earcoustic\n\n* Corlette Deveaux, MBA, CEO and Co-Founder, Remember2\n\nCaregiver Friendly Products July 11, 2024\n\n* Rob Blatt, Co-Founder, envoyatHome\n\n* Angela Fairhurst, CEO and Founder, Geri-Gadgets\n\n* Christopher Jue,Founder, CAREgivers Insight, Inc.\n\nProject Updates June 27, 2024\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/posts/lindasherman_venturesummit-marketresearch-accessibility-activity-7210842002173612033-0ddJ\n\n* Dana Keilman co-founder Morning Light Strategy\n\n* Bruce Elliott co-founder and CEO Memory Lane Games\n\n* Yasuyuki Tashibu Executive Officer Mirai Speaker sound bar soundfun.net\n\nCaregiver Friendly Products Dementia June 20, 2024\n\n* Carrie Aalberts, BS, MS Well-known as @DementiaDarling\n\n* Margot Biane Merrick, CEO and Co-founder The Loop Village\n\n* Gabriela Pelin, CEO VoiceLove\n\nFitness May 30, 2024\n\n* Mark Evin, Co-founder & CEO Ludica Health\n\n* Jim Brown, Chief Primal Officer A Balanced You\n\n* Eric Levitan, CEO & Founder Vivo\n\nSmart Home May 23, 2024\n\n* Eric Smith, Founder and CTO OliverIQ Smart Home\n\n* Akash Shah, CTO Ome Kitchen\n\n* Niels Coch, Head of Nobi Smart Lamps USA\n\nProject Updates May 16, 2024\n\n* Monika Virk, MD Founder HOP into Homecare\n\n* Robert Signore Co-founder & President Thrive Pavilion\n\n* Richard McKenna, Founder & CEO Manage My Things\n\nWomen Supporting Women May 9, 2024\n\n* Diana Place, Third Act Quest\n\n* Cat Corchado, smallspacepilates.com, Women Veterans Network (WoVeN)\n\n* Andrea M.
