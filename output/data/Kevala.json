To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we do not accept liability for unauthorized disclosure. You are also responsible for protecting your information.\n\n‍\n\nYour Kevala account is password-protected so that only you and authorized Kevala staff have access to your account information. In order to maintain this protection, do not give your password to anyone.

I'm looking to get something like [ShiftMed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shiftmed.caregiverapp&hl=en_US&gl=US) or [CareRev](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.carerevolutions.carerev&hl=en_US&gl=US). I can't find anything like it, the closest I can get to is [Connecteam](https://connecteam.com/), but it seems more like a full staffing kind of thing not meant for tempoary staff. I assume something like ShiftMed or CareRev is created by developers just for that company, we are small so we don't have that kind of money. We still use paper timesheets and everything is a bit old school calling everywhere. \n\nThank you!\n\n\n\n## Comment ID jsgnlge with +2 score by [(Robotic_Phoenix123, Reddit, 2023-07-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/15308zx/employee_scheduling_software_for_medical_staffing/jsgnlge/) (in reply to ID 15308zx):\n1. what are the key features you are looking for?\n2. number of users\n3. webapp (mobile PWA) / mobile app (like playstore / appstore)\n\n### Comment ID jsgqa2s with +2 score by [(Pressure_Livid, Reddit, 2023-07-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/15308zx/employee_scheduling_software_for_medical_staffing/jsgqa2s/) (in reply to ID jsgnlge):\n1. We need a timesheet tracking feature that includes a signature feature to verify they worked those facilities with a facility supervisor. Connecteam is the only app I see so far that includes a signature verification. We also want nurses to claim their own shifts, like CareRev.\n\n\n2. We can have anywhere from 20 to 100 nurses depending on the season.\n\n3.

In addition to a signature, you can customize that form with other text and fields. You can also mark shifts as open, but it won't allow them to assign themselves. A manager/scheduler would have to do it, but at least all communication can happen within the app.",

(A Franciscan/VM hospital in Western WA) they get anywhere from $15-$18 PER HOUR bonuses often. Does anyone else want to share about bonuses at their hospitals? I am in home care right now making $19 at my over the table job, and $25 at my under the table job. But I am interested in switching to a hospital for benefits and 3 12s instead of working 5 days a week... I was gonna get hired at a Multicare hospital in January but they were only offering $17.75 per hour and for the drive I didn't want to take the pay cut. But yes....tell me about bonuses at your hospitals. And how common they are.\n\n## Comment ID inntdgu with +12 score by [(Accidentalmom, Reddit, 2022-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cna/comments/x9fe00/hospital_bonuses/inntdgu/) (in reply to ID x9fe00):\nI make 15 an hour base but pick up an extra shift a week.

I am in western WA (way western, like on the coast) working an SNF/LTC, I have less than 1 year of experience and 1 year of nursing school. I make 24/hr with shift diff and an extra $4 per hour on shifts I pick up, which is quite a few as I am per diem. Not sure why you’re getting paid so low in a similar area.

I get premium/differentials so my average wage is \\~27/hr not including overtime. We are also super short staffed, so they have callback pay for people who pick up shifts on super slim days- this is 1.5x pay plus differentials plus overtime.

Based on three key factors: \n\n* A set of high material quality-of-life indicators coinciding  with moderate per-capita incomes, both distributed across nearly the  entire population of Kerala.\n* A set of wealth and resource redistribution programmes that have  largely brought about the high material quality-of-life indicators.\n* High levels of political participation and activism among ordinary  people along with substantial numbers of dedicated leaders at all  levels. Kerala's mass activism and committed cadre were able to function  within a largely democratic structure, which their activism has served  to reinforce.\n\nKerala's unusual socioeconomic and demographic situation was summarized by author and environmentalist [Bill McKibben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_McKibben):\n\n>Kerala, a state in India, is a bizarre anomaly among developing  nations, a place that offers real hope for the future of the Third  World. Though not much larger than Maryland, Kerala has a population as  big as California's and a per capita annual income of less than $300.   But its infant mortality rate is very low, its literacy rate among the  highest on Earth, and its birthrate below America's and falling faster.   Kerala's residents live nearly as long as Americans or Europeans.   Though mostly a land of paddy-covered plains, statistically Kerala  stands out as the Mount Everest of social development; there's truly no  place like it.\n\nI'm surprised I haven't seen it cited by more socialists and communists, since these policies were first created by a communist named EMS.

Racist memes about street shitting in India are easily countered by demonstrating that it is communists who ended this. \n\nHowever, we shouldn't be dishonest: Kerala is at best a social democracy that is also financed a lot through remittances from Indian guest workers in the UAE and Saudi-Arabia. This is nothing the CPI(M) should be blamed for, as far as I can see it, they are still a revolutionary party, but they are doing what they can within in the constraints of an Indian state, but at least they're doing a much better job than the neoliberal hellscape that is imposed on the rest of India by the BJP.\n\n### Comment ID fgldhqe with +1 score by [(hungarian_conartist, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgldhqe/) (in reply to ID fgizv5e):\n>because it proves that a communist party is actually electable and doesn't immediately cause a famine or whatever when in power.\n\nNo it doesn't.

As background, I'm an American-born Indian who visits Kerala every year or so to see my relatives. Here are my observations. \n\nFirst, if you visit the area, you'll find scores of unemployed or underemployed men and women. \n\nSecond, the young people of Kerala (excepting those who are not particularly highly-educated and home-bodies) by and large seek to immigrate to the West for higher education; most do not come back. The region is experiencing a brain and talent drain. This is not sustainable in the twenty-first century.\n\nThird, starting a small business in the area is exceedingly difficult, as worker strikes, power outages, and labor shortages pose significant challenges to successful operation. \n\nFourth, many multinational corporations are hesitant about investing in the state given these conditions. \n\nFifth, many parts of Kerala would be considered risky for women to walk alone in, even during the daylight, as there is, unfortunately, a large contingent of unemployed men who seemingly have nothing better to do than make women feel uncomfortable; when my wife and I visited Kerala last January, she experienced this. \n\nSixth, and this is my anecdotal observation, alcoholism is a chronic problem in many households as the men do not have steady and sufficient employment. \n\nSeventh, if you ask Kerala expats who live in the United States whether they would ever go back and live in Kerala, the answer will virtually always be no. I asked my father if he would go back to Kerala, and while he occasionally makes statements about returning to the old country (which men of a certain generation do, I suppose), he would never follow through on this, a position held by many ex-Keralites. In my dad's words, even making minimum wage in America at Wal-Mart, while not ideal, would be better by sheer virtue of being in America. The safety-net in Kerala is only one in name and does not guarantee any upward mobility. At least in America, one can use the safety-net to move forward. In fact, this is what my parents, both of whom are Kerala expats, did in the 1980s. Their American success story is literally impossible to achieve in Kerala.\n\nSo yes, high literacy is great, but let us not be deluded into thinking that Kerala is a great success story. It is doing better than other parts of India, which is important, but this misses the existential and spiritual crisis one feels upon landing at the airport there. Everytime I go back, I thank God my parents had the foresight to leave before my siblings and I were born.\n\nEdit: added clarifying details and organization.\n\n### Comment ID fgj01ue with +27 score by [(XasthurWithin, Reddit, 2020-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgj01ue/) (in reply to ID fgiy34y):\nThat you don't have international corporations and constant labour strikes isn't necessarily a bad thing.\n\nHow is Kerala compared to the rest of India?\n\n#### Comment ID fgj0jmu with +22 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgj0jmu/) (in reply to ID fgj01ue):\nMost of his point can hardly be linked to the \"model\" in my uninformed opinion\n\n#### Comment ID fgj1l8q with +18 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgj1l8q/) (in reply to ID fgj01ue):\nFirst, I would challenge your assumption that not having international corporations and having constant labor strikes is fine. \n\n**Multinational companies provide streams of capital.** These companies build factories, invest in job-training centers, support educational facilities, and create incentives for local government to attract better talent. Without these incentives, a government bureaucrat tends to look at local problems through the lens of \"good enough,\" as in \"these roads are good enough for us, why invest in paving them\" or \"these power cuts are fine, there aren't any factories depending on them.\"\n\n**Multinational corporations provide local employment.** If you step outside of the developed world for a moment, the average person works in an agriculture-related position. Almost 70% of the jobs found in the poorest countries of the world are based on this industry, compared to less than 5% which is located in the wealthiest nations in the world. Multinationals come in, offer higher wages (which are still low compared to global standards), then shift the standard of living. The average real wages have almost tripled since 2018 in the developing and emerging G20 countries since 2008. For example, India had the highest levels, achieving an index rating of 5.5 compared to the regional 3.7 average.\n\n**Multinational corporations help incentive improving the local infrastructure.** Similar to discussion from the first point, companies must have employees who can access job sites to become productive. That means an investment in the local infrastructure becomes necessary before operations even begin. Roads, bridges, and technology access are three of the largest barriers taken down when multinationals become active in a developing country. You’ll see education investments to improve labor skills, along with public transportation development and other unique needs that some nations may require. In Kerala, the shoddy infrastructure means that a major car company like Toyota would never come because power cuts and outages would be significantly disruptive to the regional supply chain. \n\n**Multinational corporations help diversify local economies.** Many parts of India rely on primary products for subsistence. These products tend to be related to agriculture-based industries. Multinationals provide the economies of regions in the developing world with more variety, creating diversity in local production levels. That reduces reliance on commodities which often have volatile prices because their supply and demand levels waiver so often.\n\nHappy to discuss this further, but these are the thoughts that immediately come to my mind regarding your first sentence. Yes, multinationals aren't perfect, and we can certainly list ways in which multinationals aren't great for the developing world. But, on the whole, they tend to be better than they aren't. \n\nKerala is slightly ahead of India in some areas, but to call it a success story is like saying a car with three flat tires is significantly better than a car with four flat tires. In my opinion, Kerala's story is tragic because, whereas other parts of India have lower literacy and higher infant mortality, those highly-literate Keralites leave home and never come back. Accordingly, the population demographics of Kerala have, and will continue to, become older and older. Again, this is not sustainable. Anecdotally, I would say Kerala has maybe twenty years left before it becomes like any other under-developing state in India.\n\n#### Comment ID fgkgzwv with +3 score by [(ReckingFutard, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgkgzwv/) (in reply to ID fgj01ue):\nIts unemployment rate is way above average.\n\n#### Comment ID fglcebn with +1 score by [(hungarian_conartist, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fglcebn/) (in reply to ID fgj01ue):\nKeralan economy is reliant on remittances from the young supporting parents by working overseas in the west or places like Saudi Arabia.

But it's not as great as often represented.\n\n**Low entrepreneurship**\n\nThe model is practically set to not reward risk taking behaviour such as entrepreneurship. In the short run, this doesn't make much difference. In the long run, this is severely detrimental to growth.\n\n**Low business friendliness**\n\nMultinational companies are less willing to invest in Kerala. Not surprising, since the govt does not have very friendly policy for businesses. So they invest in other places - Hyderabad, Bangalore, Delhi etc. \n\n**High brain drain**\n\nThis ties into the above two. If people don't have new and exciting avenues to work in, they leave. Kerala has one of the highest expat populations. A state that leaks resources like that will not continue this for long.\n\nThen there's the fact that there are a lot of other factors at play that you have ignored. \nIt is true that Kerala has a moderately rich populace. But it is also true that Kerala is a thin state on a sea shore, by which I mean to say that almost all the state has access to the sea, which automatically means greater prosperity. If it were land locked and had a similar accomplishment, now that would be quite a feat. A coastal state being richer than others, that's not really an anomaly. \n\n\nThen there's social reforms. Kerala boasts of a lot of social reformers, something the rest of India can not. This led to a breakdown of repressive social values. Couples with the fact that a lot of Malyali communities had a status of women unparalleled in the rest of India, Kerala had far higher *hands on deck*, as they say. \n\n\n*I'm posted in India and I have a Malyali girlfriend.*\n\n## Comment ID fgl0acs with +2 score by [(nedstarkin, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgl0acs/) (in reply to ID eyrn7s):\nJust to add one point here.

They'd rather just give all the money to rich oligarchs than to actually invest it in the people, and then wonder why things suck so badly?\n\nThis model obviously works but it's just the very minimum that should exist everywhere, it's not a lot to ask, most people would agree to this.\n\n## Comment ID fgjej18 with +1 score by [(metalliska, Reddit, 2020-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgjej18/) (in reply to ID eyrn7s):\n>Kerala\n\nHow many Keralaians took place in the strike of 250 million?

But now for what might be a bit of a hot take: new systems should never base themselves on any existent system, no matter how successful that system may be, at least not heavily. The circumstances in which systems come into being and function are always unique, and they can cause systems that would otherwise fail to be successful and systems that would otherwise be successful to fail. There are lessons to be learned from Kerala, and from Cuba, and Burkina Faso, and other countries. But using one as a model is dangerous business and individual examples of various systems in action are unreliable indicators of the viability of a certain method. I believe that we should be looking at Kevala, picking out individual pieces of the structure that work and applying them in turn. For the larger picture, we should be looking instead to the theory on which those successes are based, and how best they can be implemented in our unique situations.\n\n## Comment ID fgkhssb with +1 score by [(Leonidas391, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgkhssb/) (in reply to ID eyrn7s):\nKerala is a decent model for socialist policymaking in underdeveloped nations, but it offers little guidance for socialists operating in developed/developing nations. Kerala proves that economic growth by itself isn't necessary to improve public welfare outcomes (at least to a point), but its agrarian model and lack of independence from India itself (not arguing for or against, just saying) doesn't bode well for socialists trying to organize factory and office workers.

A different kind of Communist party.\n\n> CPI's 1957 constitution stated it would allow the existence of opposing parties after it had parliamentary majority. Party leaders, like Namboodiripad, did not like the idea of using military force to remain in power because it would reflect poorly on the CPI as a whole on a global stage. This reliance on the people's opinions created a benevolent communist government, but it also made it more difficult to enact radical reforms. **Therefore, the reforms of the CPI in Kerala were mainly moderately socialist.**\n\nMaybe not Communist at all.\n\n---\n\n> **Agrarian reform**         \nOne of the major changes advocated by the CPI was the Agrarian Relations Bill, passed in 1961. The bill was intentionally moderate because those drafting it knew it would have to pass through many constitutional channels before it would be made into a law. Over 1,000 amendments were debated due to party divisions. **Though the bill was moderate, it still changed the farming system. It abolished feudalism and aimed to create a   \n ---> capitalist <---   \nagricultural system. The CPI did not push more radical Communist land reforms. Namboodiripad stated they would not attempt state ownership or collective farms because even though such ideas might appeal to intellectuals on a scientific basis, they would not actually help the peasantry in practice**. \n\nYes! They are not typical Communist morons and they know Marxist pseudo-intellectuals are full of shit.\n\n> The bill aimed to improve wages and working conditions as well as secure employment. Landlords were only allowed to work on their land if they paid compensation, which helped protect the tenants’ rights.\n\n---\n\n> **Industrial reform**       \n> As the CPI in Kerala was ultimately controlled by the federal government, its state plan depended on the funds it could raise independently. It struggled to industrialize and develop new manufacturing plants in Kerala throughout the 1960s while balancing out the disparities of industrialization. The CPI had Industries ministers who were responsible for industrial development. It also had an Industrial Development Cooperation that gave financial assistance to companies to help them startup new manufacturing projects. In the early 1970s, the CPI created two new corporations to help with industrial development: the Kerala Industrial and Technical Consultancy Organization and the Kerala State Electronics Development Corporation. These measures improved industry on a state level, but were less successful at the local level. **To revitalize local industry, the CPI launched an ambitious Four-Year Plan, perhaps modeling itself after Stalin's Five-Year Plans which Namboodiripad considered an inspiration. The Four-Year Plan involved district-level conventions to excite potential entrepreneurs since the government wanted more private investors to spur industry. These entrepreneurs were trained to set up their own industries. The plan was hugely successful within the first 6 weeks and managed to set up eleven new industrial estates, but then lagged as the program continued.**\n\nIt seems the government in Kerala calls itself Communist and wide eyed innocents like you and your sources believe it, but they are actually pursuing moderate policies. \n\nCiting Stalin's five year plan is odd, but their actual plan was exactly the opposite of Stalin's. It was **\"to excite entrepreneurs since the government wanted more private investors to spur industry (!!!).\"**  while Stalin wanted to crush entrepreneurs to concentrate all power in the hands of the party, the stupidest policy ever.\n\n### Comment ID fgiy7fq with +5 score by [(SternerStirner, Reddit, 2020-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/eyrn7s/does_the_kerala_model_work/fgiy7fq/) (in reply to ID fgivweq):\n........You say that buddy is looking for a successful Socialist government then proceed to say that Kerala isn't Communist, it's Moderate Communist, which is Socialist, in ideological terms not internal Commie terms.

Realizing all the things you believed you wanted are just what the environment told you, not necessarily your true desire. You're less driven by the ego. You dissolved the identities you attached yourself to. A husband, a provider, a successful worker. But after the letting go you haven't constructed a life based on this new awareness. It is confusing. This is time to be still. If you are able to not start another job so soon, take time to meditate and be in nature. Go explore. What is your Dharma? What is your heart felt desire?

I encourage you to seek out what is more meaningful to you.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can continue in your career, but to realize that you don't find purpose and meaning in it, and with that realization, categorize it a simply a livelihood, and seek out purpose and meaning in other activities.",

First one has to make a sale deed also known as Kevala in Bihar. Sale deed just shows the intention of sale and has no legal meaning. \n\nAfter sale deed is complete one has to go for Mutation also known as Dakhil Khariz, which is the most important step. One can't mutate the land without verification. This is done in DCLR jurisdiction and has legal grounding. \n\nIf the said land is yours, which document you have. There are many documents related to land and not all of them prove ownership. \n\nStop being a cry baby.

Way too many! General Rule of Thumb: If a person acts pretentious, then they are not enlightened. It takes a lot more than simply doing psychedelics to become enlightened.

Something similar to the Dunning Kruger effect, they mistake awakening for enlightenment.\n\nEnlightenment in its classic meaning is very specific thing, when after Kevala Nirvikalpa Samadhi the consciousness permanently settles into a state called Sahaja Samadhi, as opposed as falling back into normal consciousness, though they may be endowed with new understandings and peacefulness.\n\nI'm not even sure if at the moment there are humans in such state, and definitely they are not talking on the Internet or bragging about it. At best there might be few people in Savikalpa Samadhi.\n\n## Comment ID e421316 with +4 score by [(None, Reddit, 2018-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/96n7td/any_of_yall_have_any_experience_with/e421316/) (in reply to ID 96n7td):\nThat can happen after a few crazy experiences. I was like that too. I still have that interest in enlightenment . But in general psychedelics just gives u ideas makes u more aware they show u what u can do to improve. Enlightenment is achieved in the sober state imo. I think enlightenment is extremely hard to actually be in though especially in the modern society. But psyches can help u become more aware and make your life better in general so that’s a pretty good thing. There are risks though\n\n## Comment ID e42an5g with +2 score by [(abnormalcy, Reddit, 2018-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/96n7td/any_of_yall_have_any_experience_with/e42an5g/) (in reply to ID 96n7td):\ni've met people who boast about having experienced ego death.   after all this time and reading about it,  i still dont even understand what ego death is,  but it seems to me that if you had experienced it,  you wouldnt be bragging about it now.\n\n### Comment ID e42auj2 with +1 score by [(dxffy, Reddit, 2018-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/96n7td/any_of_yall_have_any_experience_with/e42auj2/) (in reply to ID e42an5g):\nSometimes they just really want to share their experiences, not always \"I had this I'm better than you\" could be \"You gotta know how insane this was\" Ppl do boast ab that tho, if they sound really proud of it or they say something after like \"since then I've been very spiritual\" they prolly bragging\n\n### Comment ID e42b25f with +1 score by [(dxffy, Reddit, 2018-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/96n7td/any_of_yall_have_any_experience_with/e42b25f/) (in reply to ID e42an5g):\nEgo death is temporary tho\n\n## Comment ID e42c4nm with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2018-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/96n7td/any_of_yall_have_any_experience_with/e42c4nm/) (in reply to ID 96n7td):\nYeah, that's often a consequence of psychedelics. Anyone claiming enlightenment likely isn't enlightened. It isn't something that one owns or possesses. There is no individual independent self to claim it anyway. Anyone completely aware of that fact wouldn't claim it for themselves. Psychedelics can reveal things that people aren't yet ready for and they misinterpret them and that can often lead to delusional thinking. I know, I've been there.\n\n## Comment ID e42e3hr with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2018-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/96n7td/any_of_yall_have_any_experience_with/e42e3hr/) (in reply to ID 96n7td):\n[deleted]\n\n## Comment ID e42eu6x with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2018-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/96n7td/any_of_yall_have_any_experience_with/e42eu6x/) (in reply to ID 96n7td):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID e42fcm3 with +1 score by [(dxffy, Reddit, 2018-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/96n7td/any_of_yall_have_any_experience_with/e42fcm3/) (in reply to ID e42eu6x):\nAnyone who tries to diminish their ego is doing the opposite\n\n#### Comment ID e42ferz with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2018-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/96n7td/any_of_yall_have_any_experience_with/e42ferz/) (in reply to ID e42fcm3):\n[deleted]\n\n## Comment ID e42h7pw with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2018-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/96n7td/any_of_yall_have_any_experience_with/e42h7pw/) (in reply to ID 96n7td):\nDef used to be one.

A combination of cannabis edibles and meditation, though far less edibles as time goes on.\n\nI'd say that if someone is acting pretentious, their \"enlightenment\" is false. I couldn't act with anything except honor toward other people now. I know how easily I can become a monster, or a saint. It is the same way with everyone else. Most of the time we are caught up in our minds and suffering constantly. Humility and gratitude are the most notable signs that someone has stepped into the path toward enlightenment.\n\nIn any case, thank you for asking, hero."

Kevala spun out of Pioneer Square Labs last April.\n\nLong-term care, which includes senior living, skilled nursing and rehabilitation, home care, and hospice, is the fastest growing segment of healthcare and represents over 65,000 service providers.\n\n“Long-term care eventually affects all of us, but we in the tech industry have not done our part to properly equip the facilities and people doing the hard work on the front lines,” said Todd Owens, CEO and co-founder of Kevala. “Kevala is on a mission to deliver an integrated and intelligent solution that enables caregivers to spend more time with their patients and residents.”\n\nWith Kevala, long-term care organizations can use the platform to:\n\nAutomate the cumbersome onboarding and credentialing process;\n\nOptimize scheduling to improve labor utilization and eliminate waste;\n\nEliminate unnecessary overtime and associated staff burnout;\n\nOffer in-house caregivers a secure platform to collaborate; and\n\nProvide an efficient marketplace to add supplemental staff when necessary.\n\n“At Aegis, the key to our success has always been our people who provide remarkable, personal, hands-on care to each and every resident,” said Kris Engskov, President of Aegis Living, a national leader in senior assisted living and memory care. “We’re incredibly excited to work with Kevala to develop a unique platform that will enable us to better manage our care team’s time and scheduling - to ensure everyone is in the right place, at exactly the right time - and do it with the same technology they are already using in other parts of their lives.”\n\nWhen healthcare facilities need to employ temporary staff from third-party agencies, Kevala maintains a ready pool of high-quality, credentialed workers so that shifts can be filled without the usual delay, administration, and risk that results from managing transactions over phone and text.\n\n“The sad reality today is that supervisors call down long lists of staffing firms, relying on voice mail and ad-hoc text messages to fill urgent shifts,” said Amy Cheetham, Principal at Costanoa Ventures who joined the board as part of the financing. “It’s an archaic and painful process. We are convinced that Kevala’s solution can provide a better way.”\n\nIn the healthcare industry, compliance is often managed using paper and spreadsheets. Kevala’s solution automates the compliance process from initial hire through the lifecycle of an employee.\n\n“We love that Kevala is attacking the compliance piece of the healthcare system with a modern SaaS solution,” said Scott Dorsey, Managing Partner of High Alpha and former CEO and Chairman of ExactTarget. “This is an area ripe for change as Kevala helps organizations replace their paper and spreadsheets with intelligent software.”\n\nOwens was the former CEO of TalentWise, which was acquired by Sterling Talent Solutions forming the world’s largest background check and credentialing company. After serving as COO of Sterling, Owens then served as CEO of Appuri and Azuqua, which were acquired by Docusign and Okta, respectively.\n\nKevala’s founding team includes Noah Kusz and Patrick Lawler, both of whom were senior executives who worked closely with Owens at Azuqua, as well as Jake Gordon, a former senior technologist at EagleView and LiquidPlanner. The company will use the new funds to hire experienced web and mobile engineers, hire a product leader, and expand its service to additional long-term care organizations.\n\n“Healthcare organizations need modern, intelligent software to help them manage their workforces and improve the lives of their clients and patients,” said Greg Gottesman, Co-Founder and Managing Director of Pioneer Square Labs and PSL Ventures. “Todd is a visionary leader. I couldn’t be more excited to partner with him and the rest of the Kevala team on this unique opportunity.”\n\nAbout Kevala\n\nKevala is an intelligent workforce management and care orchestration platform specifically built to address the unique needs of long-term care organizations, including senior living, skilled nursing and rehabilitation, home care, and hospice. Long-term care is the fastest growing segment of healthcare and yet is the most underserved by technology. By building an\n\nintegrated and intelligent SaaS solution, Kevala is able to maximize employee productivity and engagement, while increasing quality of care and improving the bottom line.

      "# [Avocado Oils Tested for Phthalates — Buying Guide by Leah Segedie on 2024-08-06](https://www.mamavation.com/food/avocado-oils-tested-for-phthalates-buying-guide.html)\nWhich avocado oils have the least toxic phthalate contamination? Phthalates are hormone-disrupting chemicals in plastics & fragrances that find their way into many foods and personal care products. To solve this puzzle, Mamavation sent several of the most popular avocado oils off to an EPA-certified laboratory to test for several types of phthalates to find out. You’ve trusted Mamavation to cover topics like safest olive oils tested for phthalates, safest coconut oils tested for phthalates, safest salt sans heavy metals and microplastics, safest cookware without PFAS “forever chemicals” and nanoparticles, and safest water purifiers that filter PFAS, now join us for another consumer study on avocado oils and hormone-disrupting phthalates.\n\nDisclosure: This consumer study is released in partnership with Environmental Health News. Scientific reviews were performed by (1) Terrence Collins, Teresa Heinz Professor of Green Chemistry & Director of the Institute for Green Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University, (2) Linda S. Birnbaum, Scientist Emeritus and Former Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and National Toxicology Program & Scholar in Residence at Duke University, Adjunct Professor at the University of North Carolina, & Yale University, & (3) Pete Myers, Chief Scientist at Environmental Health Sciences, Adjunct Professor of Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University, and Co-Author of Our Stolen Future.

Copyright © 2024 Mamavation — All Rights Reserved\n\nPhthalates Found in Popular Avocado Oils\n\nMamavation’s EPA-certified laboratory found phthalates in 11 popular avocado oils. These chemicals are linked to serious health effects, which we will discuss later. Because phthalates are so problematic to hormones, Mamavation has commissioned our own scientific studies on phthalates in food products to make recommendations for the safest avocado oils. Continue reading Mamavation’s article on these products to find which brands have the lowest amounts of phthalates according to our laboratory.\n\nFor this consumer study, Mamavation sent 11 popular avocado oils from 11 brands to an EPA-certified laboratory looking for phthalates. Because Mamavation only tested one product per brand, we cannot claim to know if these issues are, in fact, industry-wide or portfolio-wide. However, based on our “spot-check” of the industry, this is what we found:\n\n100% of avocado oils analyzed by our laboratory had traces of phthalates. This is a total of 11 detections from 11 avocado oil products.\n\nRanges of phthalates were from 76 parts per billion (ppb) to 56,808 ppb. Based on the amounts presented, we created 4 categories to communicate levels of phthalates found: (1) Avocado oils with the most contamination (2) Avocado oils with still very high contamination, (3) Avocado oils with intermediate contamination, & (4) Avocado Oils with the least contamination. These categories are not based on health impacts. They are based on presenting data and where the middle ground lies in each category. We then added 2 results from Defend Our Health’s study on phthalates to give our audience more variety in choices.\n\n9% of Avocado oil products had over 20,000 ppb phthalates. That’s 1 bottle out of 11 avocado oils. We dubbed this the “Are You Kidding Me?” realm, which would have the highest amount of phthalates.\n\n18% of Avocado oil products had between 2,000 ppb and 20,000 phthalates. That’s 2 out of 11 bottles of avocado oils over 2,000 ppb. We dubbed this the “Not Our Favorite Avocado Oils with High Contamination” realm.\n\n27% of avocado oil products had between 800 ppb and 2,000 ppb phthalates. That’s 3 out of 11 bottles of avocado oil between 800 ppb and 2,000 ppb. We dubbed this the “Better Avocado Oils with Intermediate Contamination” realm.\n\n45% of avocado oil products had less than 800 ppb phthalates. That’s 5 out of 11 bottles of avocado oil that had below 800 ppb. We dubbed this the “Best Avocado Oils with Least Contamination” realm.\n\nIf you are using avocado oil to prepare meals for your family or as personal care, this investigation will be very important to follow to reduce your family’s exposure to phthalates. However, as you can see, every avocado oil manufacturer whose products Mamavation studied has work to do to remove phthalates from their products. None of the avocado oils that were tested by Mamavation or by Defend Our Health had zero detections of phthalates.\n\nPhthalates are typically found inside plastics and in undisclosed fragrances. When in plastics, they work to make the plastic more flexible. When they are in fragrances, they help carry the scent longer in the air. These chemical contaminants are found in many types of products that are involved in the food service industry like food service gloves, tubing used in dairy operations, hoses, holding tanks, and conveyor belts inside manufacturing plants. In fact, there are so many places where phthalates can show up because they are legal indirect food additives used in manufacturing for both conventional AND organic foods. There is some movement to restrict some ortho-phthalate chemicals from food packaging but not from manufacturing in general.\n\nLinda S. Birnbaum, Scientist Emeritus and Former Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and National Toxicology Program & Scholar in Residence at Duke University, Adjunct Professor at the University of North Carolina & at Yale University had this to say about the study after her review: “Phthalates cause multiple adverse health effects, including developmental effects in the reproductive system and neurotoxicity. There is also evidence for causing cancer in laboratory animals.”\n\nTypes of Phthalates Found in Our Avocado Oil Study\n\nOur laboratory found five different types of phthalates in the coconut oil we sent to them. Here’s a brief breakdown of each one.\n\nDi-2-ethylhexyl Phthalate (DEHP): DEHP is a highly toxic endocrine disruptor. It was also the most common phthalate found by our lab and is found commonly in building products (wallpaper, wire, and cable insulation), clothing (footwear, raincoats), car products, food packaging, medical devices, and children’s products (toys, grip bumpers). This chemical is also on California’s Prop. 65 list of carcinogens and reproductive toxicants. In addition, it’s been linked to endocrine disruption, reproductive issues, developmental issues, liver & kidney toxicity, asthma & allergies, & thyroid problems.\n\nDiisodecyl phthalate (DIDP): Found commonly in PVC plastics, artificial leather, toys, carpet backing, covering on wires and cables, and pool liners. This chemical is also on California’s Prop. 65 list of carcinogens and reproductive toxicants. It’s associated with health concerns including liver & kidney toxicity, developmental issues, endocrine disruption, reproductive issues, asthma & allergies, & thyroid problems.\n\nBis(2-propylheptyl) Phthalate (DPHP): This type of phthalate is a substitute for other high molecular weight phthalates used primarily for high-temperature applications such as cable wires, roofing membranes, and food containers. It is used to soften plastics and is a general-use plasticizer under investigation as an endocrine disruptor. This phthalate is associated with additional health concerns like reproductive toxicity, prenatal, perinatal, & post-natal toxicity, and genotoxicity.\n\nDi-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP): This type of phthalate is a colorless, odorless, oily liquid that doesn’t evaporate easily used to keep plastics soft or more flexible. It is used for medical tubing and blood storage bags, wire and cables, carpetback coating, floor tile, adhesives, cosmetics, and pesticides. Animal studies have demonstrated increased fetal malformations and reduced body weights of offspring. DnOP comprises about 20% of commercial C6-10 phthalate mixtures used in flooring and carpet tiles, tarps, pool liners, and garden hoses. DnOP is approved by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) as an indirect food additive which is typically used in manufacturing as seam cements, bottle cap liners, and conveyor belts. DNOP are classified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as priority environmental pollutants.\n\nDibutyl phthalate (DBP): This type of phthalate is an organic compound commonly used as a plasticizer, and as an additive to\n\nadhesives or printing inks. It usually is a colorless oil, but can have a yellow color. Use of this substance in cosmetics, such as in nail polishes, is banned in the European Union. DBP is one of the six phthalic acid esters found on the Priority Pollutant List regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Animal studies have observed that DBP is toxic to fetal development. This phthalate is associated with additional health concerns like reproductive toxicity, prenatal, perinatal, & post-natal toxicity, and genotoxicity.\n\nDiisononyl phthalate (DINP): This type of phthalate is used as a plasticizer. The European Union has set restrictions on this chemical inside food contact materials because of the determination that it’s problematic to human health. DINP is also listed on the California Prop. 65 list of carcinogens and reproductive toxicants.\n\nAdditional Studies Finding Phthalates in Cooking Oils\n\nAnother scientific report co-authored by our friends at Defend Our Health published in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology found phthalates in a range of popular children’s foods and organic products in 2023. Included in this report were 2 avocado oils.\n\nMamavation took the results from this report and added it to our list of recommendations at the bottom of this post for your review, which was two additional results. However, all coconut oils, olive oils, & avocado oils tested by Defend Our Health also had trace amounts of phthalates. It’s not so much a question of whether there are phthalates present in coconut oils, olive oils, & avocado oils. It’s a matter of what levels are present. Both of our studies confirmed that these cooking oils have different levels of phthalates present.\n\nView our consumer study on olive oils here.\n\nView our consumer study on coconut oils here.\n\nPhthalates Have Specific Problematic Health Effects\n\nPhthalates are linked to many health effects from several studies on both animals and humans. This is very problematic because phthalates are linked with hormone disruption of the endocrine system, which regulates the body’s hormones, even in trace amounts in low concentrations. Epidemiological studies have revealed that exposure to phthalates adversely affects the level of hormones within the body, which can impact several important health functions. Here are some health effects phthalate exposure is linked to.\n\nWeight gain & obesity\n\nShorter height\n\nPrecocious puberty\n\nAsthma\n\nAllergies\n\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\n\nLower IQ\n\nSocial impairment\n\nType II diabetes and insulin resistance\n\nPoor cardiovascular health\n\nThyroid function and increased risk of thyroid cancer\n\nFemales: pregnancy loss and preterm birth, low birth weight, earlier menopause\n\nMales: genital development, semen quality, reduced “masculine” play, Inhibits testosterone production, Shortened anogenital distance, or shortened “taint” , Shortened length of penis\n\nTerrence Collins, Teresa Heinz Professor of Green Chemistry & Director of the Institute for Green Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University had this to say about the study during his scientific review: “An earlier Mamavation study found that olive oils are contaminated with phthalates. Now Mamavation is finding phthalates in avocado oils. Phthalates are anti-androgens—they disrupt male hormone action. Currently, highly chemicalized countries like America are experiencing a steady drop in male fertility, quantified through a population-level decline in mean sperm count and quality. Phthalate exposures are suspected of playing a role in the declines. Phthalate contamination of food oils is completely unacceptable! Like the olive oil manufacturers, the avocado oil manufacturers should begin acting to better protect their customers by thoroughly examining every aspect of their supply and manufacturing chains to ensure that all phthalates are eliminated. And then they should learn much more about endocrine disruption and become extremely diligent in producing products that are free of endocrine-disrupting chemicals. One has to wonder why the FDA appears to be asleep on the job.”\n\nHow are Phthalates Regulated in the Food Supply & Children’s Products?\n\nBecause phthalates are so problematic to human health, there are varying restrictions on products and food at the federal level. There is, however, no consistency among federal agencies to protect the public. For instance, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) restricts certain phthalates within children’s toys and childcare products. They prohibit the import and sale of those products that contain more than 0.1% of the following phthalates:\n\ndi-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)\n\ndibutyl phthalate (DBP)\n\nbenzyl butyl phthalate (BBP)\n\ndiisononyl phthalate (DINP)\n\ndiisobutyl phthalate (DIBP)\n\ndi-n-pentyl phthalate (DPENP)\n\ndi-n-hexyl phthalate (DHEXP)\n\ndicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP)\n\nEven though the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission restricted 8 ortho-phthalates in products intended for use by children, you still see some of the same chemicals approved as indirect additives by the FDA in the food supply even when those foods are marketed to children. Furthermore, the FDA denied a citizen petition in 2022 which demanded to take these phthalate chemicals out of the food supply because they impact the hormones of children.\n\nCalifornia also has some restrictions under the Prop. 65 list of Carcinogens and Reproductive Toxicants, requiring products sold over the limits to be accompanied by a warning. Any consumer living in California who tests and finds products with specific phthalate amounts outside the limits may bring a Prop. 65 lawsuit six months after serving the company with a public notification letter. However, be advised these limits are not enforceable. California’s “right to know” law is only about warning the consumer about the carcinogenic chemicals present. Therefore, California cannot force companies to recall products that are above these limits. Here are the phthalate-criteria:\n\nBBP – Maximum Allowable Dose Levels (MADL) 1,200 μg/day (oral)\n\nDBP – MADL 8.7 μg/day\n\nDIDP – MADL 2,200 μg/day\n\nDnHP – MADL 2,200 μg/day\n\nDEHP – No Significant Risk Level (NSRL) 310 μg/day (adult), MADL 4,200 μg/day (intravenous adult), MADL 600 (intravenous infant), MADL 410 ug/day (oral for adult), MADL 58 ug/day (oral for infant).\n\nDINP – NSRL 146 μg/day\n\nIn terms of avocado oils, it could be possible that the vast majority of phthalates are finding their way into the product during manufacturing, storage, or transportation. Under the Food & Drug Administration 21 CFR rules, FDA regulates food, drugs, cosmetics, and food contact materials within the United States. The FDA sanctioned the use of 25 plasticizers via an amendment to food additive regulations: 21 CFR Part 175 through 21 CFR Part 178. These regulations allow the use of phthalates in the food supply as “indirect food additives” that can be present. These chemicals can find their way into your food in many ways during manufacturing such as:\n\nAdhesives and components of coatings used in food contact materials.\n\nComponents of paper and paperboard, such as paperboard that is in contact with aqueous and fatty foods or used as a defoaming agent on the paperboard.\n\nAdjuvants, production aids, and sanitizers used in manufacturing.\n\nPlasticizers in polymeric substances, such as phthalates in plastic PVA or PVC sheets in food contact materials OR vinyl chloride homopolymers or copolymers used in food contact materials.\n\nSurface lubricants used to make metallic products.\n\nThe European Union has banned or restricted several phthalates such as DEHP, DBP, DIBP, and BBP in a wide range of products since 2020. These bans and restrictions include children’s swimming aids, flooring, coated fabrics and paper, recreational gear, mattresses, footwear, and office supplies, among other categories. These chemicals are not expected to be found in foods above certain thresholds. However, not all phthalates are restricted or tested for either.\n\nOther Categories of Products Mamavation Has Tested for Toxic Contaminants\n\nBefore we launch into the raw data from our lab, we wanted to remind you about all the other studies we have done on indications of PFAS “forever chemicals,” pesticides, & heavy metals inside the food and consumer products you may bring inside your home. Each one of these studies were done in a similar fashion as this study with brands sent independently to the certified lab and raw data of those labs at the bottom of the post.\n\nSoft Contact Lenses\n\nGreen Beauty Makeup\n\nLip Balm\n\nCondoms & Lubricants\n\nDental Floss\n\nToilet Paper\n\nTissue Paper\n\nPeriod Underwear\n\nTampons\n\nSanitary Pads, Pantiliners, & Incontinence Pads\n\nPowdered Electrolytes\n\nCinnamon\n\nSalt\n\nButter Wrappers\n\nPasta & Tomato Sauces\n\nNut Butters (Peanut butter, etc.)\n\nCoffee\n\nOlive oils\n\nCoconut oils\n\nKetchup\n\nActivewear (Yoga Pants)\n\nSports Bras\n\nParchment Paper\n\nCupcake Liners\n\nPlastic-Free Straws\n\nSandwich Baggies (Both plastic & more “sustainable” options)\n\nFast Food Packaging\n\nFurniture\n\nChildren’s Probiotics\n\nKids’ Backpacks\n\nBaby Strollers\n\nBaby Bottles\n\nMamavation’s Investigation of Avocado Oils & Phthalates\n\nFor this study, avocado oils were purchased between February 2023 and May 2024. Each product was recorded in our database and sent directly to the lab within its original packaging. Unfortunately, 100% of avocado oils tested had at least trace amounts of ortho-phthalates, a class of hormone-disrupting chemicals.\n\nTo make this a more comprehensive list, we have combined our raw data with raw data from the study done in 2023 by Defend Our Health. As you can see, the purpose behind this consumer study is designed to help you select a food product with lower amounts of phthalates.\n\nMamavation’s EPA-certified lab tested for the following phthalates. This is not a complete list of all the phthalates that are allowed to be present as an indirect food additive according to the FDA, however, this list goes above and beyond what is already restricted by the European Union or the State of California and mirrors what was tested in 2023 by Defend Our Health.\n\nDiethyl phthalate (DEP)\n\nDi-n-propyl phthalate (DPP)\n\nDiisobutyl phthalate (DIBP)\n\nDibutyl phthalate (DBP)\n\nDihexyl phthalate (DnHP)\n\nBenzyl butyl phthalate (BBP)\n\nDicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP)\n\nDiisononyl phthalate (DINP)\n\nDi-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP)\n\nDiisodecyl phthalate (DIDP)\n\nbis(2-Ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)\n\nDimethyl phthalate (DMP)\n\nBis(2-propylheptyl) Phthalate (DPHP)\n\nDidecyl phthalate (DDP)\n\nPete Myers, Chief Scientist at Environmental Health Sciences, Adjunct Professor of Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University, and Co-Author of Our Stolen Future had this to say: “The presence of individual types of phthalates in avocado oils is just a starting point. Scientific experts in endocrine disruption are deeply concerned about the simultaneous effect of the mixtures of phthalates present. In our samples, 91% tested had at least two phthalate types present, and 64% had at least three phthalates present. That’s not a good sign.”\n\nMamavation’s Raw Data on Phthalates in Avocado Oil\n\nAre You Kidding Me?

      "# [Aryan peoples and tribes by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2020-01-03](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ancient_Indo-Aryan_peoples_and_tribes)\nThis is a list of ancient Indo-Aryan peoples and tribes that are mentioned in the literature of Indian religions.\n\nFrom the second or first millennium BCE, ancient Indo-Aryan peoples and tribes turned into most of the population in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent – Indus Valley (roughly today's Punjab), Western India, Northern India, Central India, and also in areas of the southern part like Sri Lanka and the Maldives through and after a complex process of migration, assimilation of other peoples and language shift.[3]\n\nAncestors\n\n[edit]\n\nProto-Indo-Iranians (common ancestors of the Iranian, Nuristani and Indo-Aryan peoples) (Proto-Indo-Iranian speakers)\n\nProto-Indo-Aryans (Proto-Indo-Aryan speakers)\n\nVedic tribes\n\n[edit]\n\nAlina people (RV 7.18.7)\n\nAnu (RV 1.108.8, RV 8.10.5)\n\nĀyu\n\nBhageratha\n\nBhalanas\n\nBharatas- The Bharatas are a major Aryan clan, especially in Mandala 3 attributed to the Bharata sage Vishvamitra. The entire Bharata clan is described as crossing over, with their chariots and wagons, at the confluence of the Vipash (Beas River) and Shutudri (Satlej). The Bharatas are mentioned as the protagonists in the Battle of the Ten Kings in Mandala 7 (7.18 etc.), where they are on the winning side. They appear to have been successful in the early power-struggles between the various Aryan and non-Aryan clans so that they continue to dominate in post-Rigvedic texts, and later in the (Epic) tradition. \"Bhārata\" today is the official name of the Republic of India (see also Etymology of India).\n\nChedi\n\nDasa\n\nDasyu\n\nDṛbhīka\n\nDruhyus (Rigveda, RV 1.108.8, RV 8.10.5)\n\nGandhara\n\nGuṅgu\n\nIkshvaku dynasty\n\nKrivi\n\nKīkaṭa\n\nKuru\n\nMahīna\n\nMalankhara\n\nMaujavant\n\nMatsya\n\nNahuṣa\n\nPakhta\n\nPanis\n\nPārāvata\n\nParsu (Parśu)\n\nPuru (Pūru)\n\nRuśama (RV Mandala 8)\n\nSārasvata\n\nSrñjaya\n\nTritsu (RV 7.18, 7.33, 7.83)\n\nYadu: Of Indo-Aryan origin,Yadu is one of the five early Rigvedic tribes (panchajana, panchakrishtya or panchamanusha) mentioned in the Rigveda.[4] The Yadus had a tribal union with the Turvasha tribe, and were frequently described together.[page needed] The Yadus were a Aryan tribe. By the time of the arrival of the Puru and Bharata tribes, the Yadu-Turvashas were settled in Punjab, with the Yadus possibly residing along the Yamuna River. In Mandalas 4 and 5 of the Rigveda, the god Indra is stated to have saved the Yadu-Turvashas from drowning when they crossed rivers. In Mandala 6, the Yadu-Turvashas are stated to have been \"brought from far away\" by Indra. The Yadu-Turvashas are treated relatively positively in Mandalas 5, 6, and 8, and are stated to be the occasional allies and enemies of the Puru-Bharatas. In the Battle of the Ten Kings, the Yadus were defeated by Bharata chieftain Sudas.\n\nPancha Jana (Five tribes)\n\n[edit]\n\n(पञ्च जना – Páñca Jánāḥ / Pancha-janah) The pancha Jana are five tribes inexplicitly listed together during the (Āryāvarta of this time, c. 1700–1500 BCE, roughly corresponds with the Punjab and closer regions) (see the map of Early Vedic Period)\n\nAnu (in the southwest part of early Āryāvarta)\n\nDruhyu (in the north part of early Āryāvarta)\n\nPuru (ancestors of the Paurava) (in the centre and east parts of early Āryāvarta, including Sarasvati river region)\n\nTurvaśa (Turvasha) (in the centre and south parts of early Āryāvarta): The Turvashas (Sanskrit: तुर्वश, Turvaśa) were one of the five major peoples (panchajana, panchakrishtya or panchamanusha) mentioned in the Rigveda. [16] The Turvashas had a tribal union with the Yadu tribe, and were frequently described together. The Turvashas were a partly Indo-Aryan-acculturated Indus tribe. By the time of the arrival of the Puru and Bharata tribes, the Yadu-Turvashas were settled in Punjab. By the time of the Shatapatha Brahmana (7th-6th centuries BCE),[20] the Turvashas are linked to the Panchalas. Alfred Ludvig first conjectured that Turvīti and Vayya could have been connected with the Turvasha tribe, a notion that is still considered only speculation according to Witzel. In Mandalas 4 and 5 of the Rigveda, the god Indra is stated to have saved the Yadu-Turvashas from drowning when they crossed rivers. In Mandala 6, the Yadu-Turvashas are stated to have been \"brought from far away\" by Indra. The Yadu-Turvashas are treated relatively positively in Mandalas 5, 6, and 8, and are stated to be the occasional allies and enemies of the Puru-Bharatas.\n\nYadu (in the southeast and south parts of early Āryāvarta)\n\nEarly Janapadas (c. 1700–1100 BCE)\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter roughly 1700 BCE Indo-Aryan peoples and tribes were swiftly expanding through ancient northern India, therefore the number of peoples, tribes and clans was increasing (as well as the number of Indo-Aryan language speakers) and Āryāvarta was becoming a very large area (see the map on the right side).\n\nAja – (Madhya-desha Āryāvarta – Central Āryāvarta)\n\nAmbaśṭha – (Madhya-desha Āryāvarta – Central Āryāvarta)\n\nAṅga – Prachya Āryāvarta – Eastern Āryāvarta (Madhya-desha and Prachya Āryāvarta – Central and Eastern Āryāvarta in Vamana).\n\nAnu – is a Vedic Sanskrit term for one of the 5 major tribes in the Rigveda, RV 1.108.8, RV 8.10.5 (both times listed together with the Druhyu) and, much later also in the Mahabharata.[23] In the late Vedic period, one of the Anu kings, King Anga, is mentioned as a \"chakravartin\" (AB 8.22). Ānava, the vrddhi derivation of Anu, is the name of a ruler in the Rigvedic account of the Battle of the Ten Kings (7.18.13) and at 8.4.1 with the Turvaśa (tribe). The meaning ánu \"living, human\" (Naighantu) cannot be substantiated for the Rigveda[24] and may have been derived from the tribal name. (Pratichya Āryāvarta – Western Āryāvarta)\n\nĀyu[25]\n\nBhajeratha[26]\n\nBhalana – The Bhalanas were one of the tribes that fought against Sudas in the Dasarajna battle. Some scholars have argued that the Bhalanas lived in South Central and Western Pakistan, and that the Bolan Pass, around which live the Brahui people, are the Bhalana people and abode.[23] (Pratichya Āryāvarta – Western Āryāvarta)\n\nBharadvāja – (Madhya-desha Āryāvarta – Central Āryāvarta)\n\nBhrigus[28]\n\nBheda – (Madhya-desha Āryāvarta – Central Āryāvarta)\n\nBodha – (Madhya-desha Āryāvarta – Central Āryāvarta)\n\nDruhyu – The Druhyu were a people of Vedic India. They are mentioned in the Rigveda,[a] usually together with the Anu tribe.[29] Some early scholars have placed them in the northwestern region. The later texts, the Epic and the Puranas, locate them in the \"north\", that is, in Gandhara, Aratta and Setu. (Vishnu Purana IV.17) The Druhyus were driven out of the land of the seven rivers, and their next king, Gandhara, settled in a north-western region which became known as Gandhāra. The sons of the later Druhyu king Pracetas too settle in the \"northern\" (udīcya) region (Bhagavata 9.23.15–16; Visnu 4.17.5; Vayu 99.11–12; Brahmanda 3.74.11–12 and Matsya 48.9.). The word Druid (Gallic Celtic druides), is partially derived from Proto-Indo-European vid \"to see, to know'[31] [32] It has also been alleged that the Rg Veda and the Puranas describe this tribe as migrating North.[33] However, there is nothing of this in the Rigveda and the Puranas merely mention that the Druhyu are \"adjacent (āśrita) to the North\".

Bharatá is also used as a name of Agni (literally, \"to be maintained\", viz. the fire having to be kept alive by the care of men), and as a name of Rudra in RV 2.36.8. In one of the \"river hymns\" RV 3.33, the entire Bharata tribe is described as crossing over, with their chariots and wagons, at the confluence of the Vipash (Beas) and Shutudri (Satlej). Hymns by Vasistha in Mandala 7 (7.18 etc.) mention the Bharatas as the protagonists in the Battle of the Ten Kings, where they are on the winning side. They appear to have been successful in the early power-struggles between the various Aryan and non-Aryan tribes so that they continue to dominate in post-Rigvedic texts, and later in the (Epic) tradition, the Mahābhārata, the eponymous ancestor becomes Emperor Bharata, conqueror of 'all of India', and his tribe and kingdom is called Bhārata. \"Bhārata\" today is the official name of the Republic of India (see also Etymology of India).

It is possible that they are connected with the Alans or Alani people who are a nomadic Iranian tribe. Alans is a dialectal cognate of Aryāna, itself derived from the root arya-, meaning 'Aryan', the common self-designation of Indo-Iranian peoples. It probably came in use in the early history of the Alans for the purpose of uniting a heterogeneous group of tribes through the invocation of a common, ancestral 'Aryan' origin. The historian S. G.

According to Chandra Das, the name \"Shakya\" is derived from the Sanskrit word \"śakya,\" which means \"the one who is capable\".

      "# [5 Best Avocado Oils, Ranked by Shyla Cadogan, RD, Shyla Cadogan on 2024-07-22](https://studyfinds.org/best-avocado-oil/)\nPhoto by Lukas Gojda on Unsplash\n\nAvocado oil may be considered the liquid gold of the health-conscious foodie community. Whether you’re drizzling it over your salad, sautéing your veggies, or pretending to be fancy while cooking scrambled eggs, avocado oil has found a way to sneak into our kitchens and hearts. To help you find the best avocado oils, StudyFinds visited 10 expert websites and put together this list of the most-recommended products across these sites. As always, leave your recommendations of your favorite avocado oils in the comments below!\n\nStudyFinds is a research-driven platform that analyzes and synthesizes expert recommendations from trusted sources. Rather than writing reviews ourselves, we meticulously compile consensus findings from leading industry experts and established publications to save consumers valuable research time. Each article represents hours of analysis across multiple authoritative sources to identify the most consistently recommended choices.\n\n1. Chosen Foods 100% Pure Avocado Oil\n\nAvocado oil can sometimes have a strong, distinct flavor that isn’t always desired in a recipe, but Chosen Foods is used to preparing avocados in a unique way that provides the best quality product for their consumers.\n\n“Chosen Foods built its entire brand around harnessing the power of avocados, so it’s no wonder its 100% Pure Avocado Oil earned the spot of best overall. It’s non-GMO, expeller-pressed, and naturally refined, to give you a neutral taste without any additives,” The Spruce Eats writes. “Chosen Foods’ avocados, which come from Mexico are never sprayed with any pesticides and are irrigated only with rainwater.”\n\nExperts also like that it comes in a sprayable version. “Meal preparation becomes much easier and more accessible with aerosol. Besides, choosing an essential oil spray is not only convenient but also good for your health. Since this is pressed and naturally refined without the use of chemicals, you can count on it,” says Lacademie in their review.\n\nIt’s such high-quality that you can even use it to reach your skincare and beauty goals. “Made from Hass avocados, it can be used in cooking, salads and your beauty routine,” adds Chef’s Pencil.\n\n2. La Tourangelle Avocado Oil\n\nLa Tourangelle is known for having several lines of top-notch oils that make a perfect addition to your kitchen, and their avocado oil is surely included. “The mainstay of all La Tourangelle’s natural, artisanal oils is premium taste derived from the best quality ingredients. Add the flavor of La Tourangelle to any meal,” Find This Best writes.\n\nLacademie praises its health benefits for using with cooking or as a haircare or skincare product. “La Tourangelle oil is 100% hand-crafted from premium California avocados. It is also Project Non-GMO and certified as gluten-free.”\n\nAvocado oil can sometimes come with a steep price tag, but not this one! “This oil brings the best for the buck. 250 ml of oil is extracted from about 20 avocados, making this oil dense and with a potent aroma, but quite the pleasant flavor. And it’s affordable,” Chef’s Pencil writes.\n\n3. Avohass Avocado Oil\n\nAlthough this oil is the prime example of one that comes with a significant price tag, it’s one of the only oils that is actually cold pressed. “Avohass avocado oil is one of the only truly cold-pressed avocado oils on the market. The oil is extracted from the best unbruised grade-A California avocados at their peak ripeness, without the use of any heat or chemicals. Also, the oil is extra-virgin and organic-certified, which means it’s really one of the highest-quality oils you can get,” The Spruce Eats writes.\n\nFind This Best describes this product as, “vibrant green in color with a slightly nutty, rich, and buttery avocado flavor.”\n\nThis oil is also unrefined, meaning that the smoke point is a little bit lower at 400 degrees Fahrenheit and may not be the best for frying. However, it doesn’t fall short at all for just about anything else. “It’s still a suitable option for most types of cooking, such as sautéing, stir-frying, and roasting,” The Spruce Eats adds.\n\n4. Primal Kitchen Extra Virgin Avocado Oil\n\nPrimal Kitchen is a popular brand that is dedicated to their mission of making sure healthy fats are part of their condiments, sauces, and other kitchen staples. Their extra virgin avocado oil is derived from Spanish avocados and works best as a cold addition to your meals.\n\n“It’s best for cold dishes, like as part of a dressing for salads or a finishing oil for roasted vegetables but, you can also use it for medium- to low-heat cooking,” The Spruce Eats writes.\n\nBecause this product has a smoke point of up to 520ºF, you can comfortably use it for all your high-temperature cooking ideas,” Lacademie adds. “Not only that, you will love the glass packaging of Primal Kitchen. This material excellently preserves all the flavors after opening.”\n\nSeveral products from Primal Kitchen are go-to options among low-carb folks, and their avocado oil is certified to meet these dietary restrictions as well. “This oil is approved and certified by Whole 30 and Paleo diets and is also ideal for the Keto diet,” LA Times writes.\n\n5. Kevala Avocado Oil\n\nIf you’re looking for a bulk option that’s affordable and can be used in various ways, Kevala is the option for you. “Kevala Avocado Oil is best for people seeking a large quantity that they can use for the long term. This oil is produced through cold-pressing, making it a pure, nutritious, and chemical-free product,” LA Times writes.\n\nChef’s Pencil adds: “It has a mild taste and aroma and consumers find it ideal, since it’s not too overwhelming. If you’re just turning to avo oil, start with this one!”\n\nAs is the case for all of the oils listed, Kevala is beloved by many for its versatility, but is recommended for specific foods too!\n\n“Kevala oil can deal with any dish thanks to its impressive high smoke point up to 500ºF. It can even show up as one of the chosen oils to make popcorn. Or you can make home mayo with this product,” Lacademie writes.\n\nSources used to create this consensus list\n\nThe Spruce Eats\n\nLacademie\n\nChef’s Pencil\n\nFind This Best\n\nLA Times\n\nBest Reviews\n\nMSN\n\nSimply Recipes\n\nSure Keto\n\nBest Reviews UK\n\nNote: This article was not paid for nor sponsored.

      "# [The 5 Best Apple Cider Vinegars of 2024 by Marisa Olsen, www.facebook.com on 2024-12-19](https://www.eatingwell.com/best-apple-cider-vinegar-8763438)\nWhat we like: Organic and unfiltered with “the mother,” Bragg offers a balanced and tasty ACV at a reasonable price.\n\nWhat to know: This ACV has a bit of tang and funky taste upfront.\n\nBragg apple cider vinegar has withstood the test of time. Paul Bragg began his wellness empire over 100 years ago when he started selling apple cider vinegar. I frequently reach for this ACV, so I was excited to consider it in the lineup. Among the many things I like about this product are that it’s USDA-organic, non-GMO, raw, contains the mother and can be found at most grocery stores.\n\nDuring my tasting, there was a slight effervescence that occurred when I opened the jar. I noted aromas of bloomy, earthy notes of hay alongside fragrant and sweet floral tones with a touch of apple cider at the end of the nose. The coloring of the ACV was muted brown and muddy with dark, straw-like hues that were pretty opaque.\n\nThe first notes on the palate revealed high acid, very tart green apple and a tanginess upfront with intensity on the tip of the tongue that then mellowed. I observed a slight acidic tingle in the back of my throat—almost like a blooming quality that ended with a gentle sweetness. The texture was smooth in the mouth, while the acidity did linger near the front of my teeth. I ultimately found Bragg’s apple cider vinegar well balanced, with earthy and grassy characteristics that rounded out with a sweet finish.\n\nBragg’s suggests mixing one tablespoon of ACV with 8 ounces of filtered or sparkling water. Bragg apple cider vinegar is available in 16, 32, 64 and 128 ounces. Bragg is a certified B Corporation and kosher.\n\nRaw/Unpasteurized: Yes | Unfiltered: Yes | Non-GMO: Yes | USDA Organic: Yes | Serving Size: 1 tablespoon | Servings per Container: 32\n\nWhat we like: ZOE is an organic, raw vinegar crafted in Italy that showcases the subtle terroir of the region.\n\nWhat to know: It may not readily be available at most grocery stores.\n\nIf I’m looking to mix it up from Bragg, I frequently reach for ZOE while shopping at my local gourmet grocery store. This Italian ACV is organic, raw and unfiltered and boasts a 5% acidity. Crushed apples are naturally fermented in wooden casks at high altitudes in the Trentino Alto Adige region, creating a unique flavor from the Italian terroir that’s different from many other ACVs on the market.\n\nUpon testing, I found ZOE to be mild in aroma, with a faint, sweet honey mixed with an amber ale and fragrant apples alongside a subtle earthiness. The texture and appearance of the ACV was thick, like sherry or an after-dinner liquor, yet still a bit transparent. The color was glossy and rich with honey and amber hues. I also detected quite a bit of sediment in the bottle, which is constructed of glass with an inner plastic spout that makes it easy to pour without spilling, which I thought was a nice touch.\n\nDuring my sampling, I observed a mild, sweet red McIntosh apple note that was bright and easy to sip without any overly distracting sharpness of upfront acid. There were also notes of sherry, caramel and vanilla. I found a slightly chalky mouthfeel with some lingering tannins and acid in the back of my throat, but it was manageable and not offensive. Overall, ZOE is a floral, mild and smooth ACV that is raw and unfiltered but without the funkiness that often comes with other raw apple cider vinegars.\n\nRaw/Unpasteurized: Yes | Unfiltered: Yes | Non-GMO: Yes | USDA Organic: Yes | Serving Size: 1 tablespoon | Servings per Container: 34\n\nWhat we like: This ACV is packaged in a BPA-free plastic container and features freshly pressed USA-sourced organic apples.\n\nWhat to know: It features a spout for easy pouring, but it’s difficult to remove the plastic seal.\n\nFor unfiltered and raw ACV, Kevala Organic Apple Cider Vinegar is an excellent choice. This ACV has a 5% acidity and is unpasteurized, raw, unfiltered with “the mother” and certified organic by California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF).\n\nIn terms of aroma, I noted hints of earthy, umami tones with sweet grassy hay, barnyard funk and wet cardboard, but surprisingly, not off-putting. The coloring was a light, rusty orange hue with mild hints of rich amber maple syrup and farm-grown honey. The liquid was nearly opaque in the bottle, and I could see plenty of grainy sediment at the bottom of the glass jar.\n\nDuring my taste test, I expected Kevala to be more funky, but surprisingly I found this ACV to have a bright flavor profile with more tart apple on the tongue, but also well-rounded with some grassy earthiness at the finish. The ACV showcased zippy acid upfront with light tannins on the teeth and back of the throat. I also noticed a bit of a cloudy mouthfeel, but it wasn’t unpleasant. I found the drinking experience interesting and pleasant, with a snappy but well-balanced finish.\n\nKevala recommends giving the bottle a shake before using, and it is available in various sizes, including 8, 12, 35, 64 and 128 ounces.\n\nRaw/Unpasteurized: Yes | Unfiltered: Yes | Non-GMO: Yes | USDA Organic: Yes | Serving Size: 1 tablespoon | Servings per Container: 23\n\nWhat we like: Heinz’s version comes at a reasonable price and is easy to find at most local grocery stores.\n\nWhat to know: This particular ACV is not organic.\n\nIf you want to incorporate ACV into your cooking game, Heinz Apple Cider Vinegar is another popular contender. The 5% acidity and various flavor profiles make this ACV an excellent addition to soups, salad dressings and even marinades. However, heating raw ACV at high temperatures with pasteurization will kill the live healthy bacteria.\n\nThis Heinz ACV is filtered and bright but mild enough to cook with. In terms of aroma, I discerned notes of honey and sherry with a slight wet cardboard scent and under notes of a grassy yet sweet sharpness. The coloring of the Heinz ACV was a deep yellow with tints of rusty amber and was quite translucent both in the bottle and in the tasting glass.\n\nUpon sampling, I noted hints of red Gala apple, dry sherry and bright tartness. The mouthfeel was smooth and thin with mild tannins that clung to my teeth and lingered in the back of my throat just slightly.\n\nI was curious how a national grocery store brand would stand up to more nuanced contenders. I found Heinz to be pleasantly mild and balanced, and it would make a nice addition to most kitchen pantries.\n\nRaw/Unpasteurized: No | Unfiltered: No | Non-GMO: N/A | USDA Organic: No | Serving Size: 1 tablespoon | Servings per Container: 32\n\nWhat we like: Wedderspoon’s ACV is a delicious mix of manuka honey and vinegar that is easy to sip.\n\nWhat to know: It contains 2 grams of sugar (due to the honey) and is packaged in plastic.\n\nIf you’re looking for a comforting ACV drink, I liked the Wedderspoon Apple Cider Vinegar with Manuka Honey. This ACV is made from New Zealand cold-pressed apple juice, which is unfiltered and double-fermented and mixed with raw mono flora mānuka and beechwood honey.\n\nUpon opening this bottle, I noticed aromas heavy in honey with undernotes of earth, grass, pollen and a cloying sweetness. The Wedderspoon ACV boasts a fresh apple cider hue tinged with rusty tones. The jar I sampled had a dark, tawny-toned mother floating at the top that almost looked like a brown lemon seed with extra “pulp” attached. I also observed lots of sediment floating around.\n\nDuring my tasting, I also picked up notes of sweet honey and caramel that lingered with a gentle acidity and very mild tannins. There were also forward notes of apple and honey and a hint of a barnyard funk underneath the layers. The texture in my mouth during tasting had a thicker mouthfeel, and I noticed an ever-so-slight acid clinging to my teeth and the back of my throat, but it was quite mild. Overall, I found this elixir mild, sweet and nice to sip on.\n\nWedderspoon suggests shaking the bottle before using it and enjoying this blend at a ratio of one tablespoon of ACV to one cup of water.\n\nRaw/Unpasteurized: Yes | Unfiltered: Yes | Non-GMO: N/A | USDA Organic: No | Serving Size: 1 tablespoon | Servings per Container: 50\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhen it comes to apple cider vinegar, you can’t beat Bragg Original Apple Cider Vinegar (view at Amazon). Not only has this ACV been on the market for a century, but I found the flavor profiles and composition balanced, making it easy to sip on and cook with. Bragg naturally ferments fresh and organic apples directly from farms, and each bottle contains the mother. For a more filtered version, Heinz Apple Cider Vinegar (view on Amazon) is a great option, too.\n\nChoosing an Apple Cider Vinegar\n\n“With the Mother”\n\nLiquid apple cider vinegar may be packaged in different forms, including raw and unfiltered with the mother and filtered.\n\nThe \"mother\" is the cloudy, web-like substance you might see floating in the bottle. “It forms naturally during fermentation and is made up of beneficial bacteria, enzymes and proteins,” says Newlin. She adds that this combination is thought to “play a role in many of the health benefits associated with apple cider vinegar, as it adds nutrients and probiotics to the vinegar.”\n\nTo help us understand the different types of apple cider vinegar you may find on the market, Newlin walked us through the various styles and their distinct qualities:\n\nRaw apple cider vinegar is unfiltered and unpasteurized, retaining the mother, which contains the beneficial bacteria and enzymes that may boost its antioxidant and antimicrobial effects.\n\nFiltered apple cider vinegar has been processed to remove the mother and appears as a clear liquid. While this type has a longer shelf life, it lacks some of the bioactive components found in raw, unfiltered varieties.\n\nA note of caution when consuming unpasteurized foods: Pregnant or breastfeeding women and those with compromised immune systems should avoid or use extreme caution when consuming raw and unpasteurized foods, which may lead to medical complications or possible listeria exposure.\n\nAcidity levels\n\nThe acidity level in ACV is mainly due to its acetic acid content, which Newlin says can play a key role in its health benefits and antimicrobial effects. The “higher acidity enhances its potential health advantages and strengthens its ability to potentially fight off harmful microorganisms,” says Newlin.\n\nThe acidity level of apple cider vinegar ranges by brand, but most household ACVs have an acidity of 5%. However, when ingesting ACV, it’s important to always dilute it with some water, as high levels of acidity can lead to tooth erosion. Swishing or drinking with a straw can lessen the effects of acid on the teeth. Acidic drinks may also cause stomach or gastric distress, so it’s always a good idea to check with your healthcare provider before consuming apple cider vinegar.\n\nLiquid Forms vs. Pills or Gummies\n\nApple cider is most commonly consumed and taken in its natural liquid state. However, other dietary supplements are available in tablet, powder and gummy form. It’s also common to see both the liquid and supplemental forms mixed with other ingredients, such as honey, ginger or turmeric.\n\nWhile chewing on an apple cider vinegar gummy may seem like a win-win, it may not be as beneficial as you think, primarily due to the added sugar in many gummy supplements.\n\nFurthermore, apple cider dietary supplements are not regulated by the FDA and many are not independently evaluated. Plus, acidity levels may not be disclosed. If you prefer the supplement path, it’s a good idea to check the labels for dosage, ingredients and acidity levels and look for brands that are independently verified.\n\nFor the biggest benefit, Newlin recommends selecting an unfiltered liquid apple cider vinegar with the mother, since pills and gummies may offer more limited benefits.\n\nOur Apple Cider Vinegar Tests\n\nOur team researched 10 popular apple cider vinegar brands commonly found on grocery shelves or online that ranged from pasteurized to raw and those containing the mother. We landed on 10 brands in addition to a gummy and tablet supplement that I then sampled and tasted at home.\n\nTo start, I looked at the color of the vinegar and the initial smell. I was looking for notes of sweet, fruity, and earthy and was keen on identifying any vinegars that smelled sharp, like nail polish, that could indicate undesirable fermentation.\n\nFor my taste tests, I diluted my sample with a 3:1 water-to-apple-cider-vinegar ratio, as I wanted to be cautious with apple cider vinegar’s high acidity levels. I took small sips and made sure to drink a sip of water in between, as well as small bites of mozzarella cheese to clear and balance my palate. I noted certain flavor profiles, such as fruity and woody notes, and observed the texture and mouthfeel of each vinegar.\n\nAfter sipping each diluted sample, I compared and cross-referenced all the samples to form my list of best apple cider vinegars.\n\nWe Also Considered\n\nDynamic Health Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar ($28 at Amazon): I liked how this ACV was organic, raw and contained the mother. However, I found it to be a little dry and too sweet, and the zippy acid that lingered in the back of my throat was distracting.\n\nWoeber’s Pure Apple Cider Vinegar ($15 at Amazon): While this ACV is available in large quantities for an affordable price, I found the flavor profile to be off-putting and artificially sweet.\n\nLucy’s Organic Apple Cider ($29 at Amazon): I found this ACV too funky and fermented. Upon tasting, Lucy’s was highly acidic, and the lasting tannic structure was too distracting and dry in the mouth.\n\nVermont Village Raw Organic Apple Cider Vinegar (2-pack for $24 at Amazon): This ACV was not as balanced as I liked, with an intense bitterness and tartness that made my throat feel dry with its overwhelming acidity.\n\nBragg Refresher Apple Cider Vinegar with Ginger Lemon Honey (2-pack for $15 at Amazon): I was interested in trying an effervescent probiotic drink but found this beverage a bit bland and muted.\n\nNature's Bounty Apple Cider Vinegar Pills ($10 at Amazon): I wanted to try different forms of apple cider vinegar, so I sampled these tablets with 480 milligrams of ACV. Upon opening the container, the tablets revealed a potent nail polish-like odor, which was off-putting.\n\nEssential Elements Apple Cider Vinegar Gummies from The Mother ($23 at Amazon): I was curious about the ACV gummy format, but I found the flavoring distracting, with a faux apple flavoring and a saccharine finish. Plus, I didn’t care for the 4 g of added sugar.\n\nCommon Questions\n\nIs apple cider vinegar good for weight loss?\n\nWhile some studies suggest that apple cider vinegar can act as a weight loss supplement, such studies are generally limited. However, there are a few that support this claim. In a recent study, participants with overweight or obesity who consumed three doses of apple cider vinegar each day over the course of 12 weeks lost weight and improved their blood sugar levels. Participants who took the highest daily dose of apple cider vinegar (15 mL) lost the most weight—on average, about 15 pounds total. That being said, even the lowest dosage (5 mL per day) led to weight loss. Other studies looked at lipids and glycemic parameters and found that apple cider vinegar lowered total cholesterol in participants and improved fasting plasma glucose.\n\nSo, yes, apple cider vinegar can be a helpful addition when working toward weight loss goals.\n\nHow should I take apple cider vinegar and should I drink it daily?\n\nIn many cases, apple cider can be enjoyed safely and frequently. But before you go diving in and gulping down large amounts of apple cider vinegar, beware of its high levels of acidity, which can affect tooth enamel and irritate sensitive stomachs. Additionally, if you suffer from low levels of potassium (hypokalemia), overconsumption could lead to lower potassium levels.\n\nFor optimal benefits, Newlin recommends selecting raw and unfiltered apple cider vinegar with the mother, with a standard dose of 1 to 2 tablespoons diluted in water before meals.\n\nApple cider vinegar may interact with certain medications, such as those for people with diabetes, and supplements, so it’s a good idea to check with your healthcare provider before adding ACV to your daily diet.\n\nDoes apple cider vinegar help control blood sugar?\n\nFor those who suffer from blood sugar issues or diabetes, finding a natural supplement to ease blood sugar spikes and dips can be beneficial. While studies are limited, several have examined the effects of consuming ACV in people with type 2 diabetes. There is some evidence that consuming ACV regularly could help regulate fasting plasma glucose levels and improve hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), which is a measure of overall blood sugar control over a three month period.\n\nMoreover, in a 2023 randomized clinical trial (which is the gold standard for study design), type 2 diabetes participants were given either a daily dose of 30 ml of ACV or a control substance over several weeks. At the end of the study, those who consumed the ACV had improved blood lipid profiles and better blood glucose control.\n\nCan I use apple cider vinegar on my skin and hair?\n\nIf you’re not into sipping on ACV, you may still want to keep a bottle handy. Apple cider vinegar can be a natural skin product that can safely be added to your wellness routine.\n\nAs Newlin says, “Apple cider vinegar is popular for hair and skin care, though scientific backing varies.” For hair, Newlin shares that ACV is commonly used as a rinse to balance the scalp’s pH, reduce dandruff and help boost shine. “Many users dilute 1 to 2 tablespoons in a cup of water and apply it post-shampoo for these benefits.” ACV can also make an excellent DIY hair mask.\n\nThat being said, Newlin advises that clinical evidence is limited regarding the benefits of apple cider vinegar for hair and skin remedies.\n\nOur Trusted Expertise\n\nMarisa Olsen has more than 10 years of experience writing and reporting on food, lifestyle and product reviews, and she has written for multiple publications, including U.S. News & 360 Reviews, Chowhound, Southern Living, The Spruce Eats, Food & Wine, Byrdie and Liquor.com.
