      "# Post ID 1dddnmx: The Coalition did with Gears Of War what 343 should have done with Halo years ago. with +1 score by [(VeterinarianSouth572, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1dddnmx/the_coalition_did_with_gears_of_war_what_343/)\nLast sunday the coalition showed us what they have been cooking with a trailer the new Gears Of War which is not a reboot, neither Gears 6 but a prequel. I believe that they realized that the last games (4 and 5) have not been appreciated like the og games made by most of the og developers, same happened with Halo (4 and 5 are nowhere close as good and appreciated as Bungie games and everyone got their own reasons); What I want to say is, at Coalition they realized they had to gave something different to the franchise instead of kepp going with the main story, maybe they are trying to get back to the roots of the franchise. Why 343 instead of making halo 5 and infinite didn't do like them; I do not want a prequel with MC (there will also probably be incongruences beetween Halo Reach and the Fall of Reach book) what I want to say is: halo proved with ODST and Reach that it can be a great game without chief so why keep going with a story pratically on life support instead of making something different?(maybe another odst campaign, another related to a new spartan group, you guys tell me)\n\n## Comment ID l842m8b with +90 score by [(dude52760, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1dddnmx/the_coalition_did_with_gears_of_war_what_343/l842m8b/) (in reply to ID 1dddnmx):\nI don’t get what you’re saying. Halo did the same nostalgia baiting back in 2018 when they released the first reveal of Halo Infinite. It got very similar reactions in this community that the Gears trailer is currently getting in that community. It didn’t pan out when the game actually released. It is what it is.\n\nThe real puzzling thing to me is you’re praising Gears for going back to Marcus Fenix as the main protagonist while simultaneously criticizing Halo for bringing Master Chief back as the protagonist in 2012. What is the point you’re making here?\n\n## Comment ID l842e9a with +13 score by [(musuperjr585, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1dddnmx/the_coalition_did_with_gears_of_war_what_343/l842e9a/) (in reply to ID 1dddnmx):\nWhile its extremely early to tell how well the new Gears of War game will be received, i do agree with your general point that Halo should go in a new direction.   \n\n\nI don't have all the answers, and I personally don't think a reboot or prequel will be the answer. From Microsoft's point of view a Halo game without master chief is a gamble that has not worked out well financially. Both Halo Wars and Halo Wars 2 were reviewed well but did not sell as well as the company has hoped.   \n\n\nHalo is in a stagnant place right now. I think Halo needs a break. They can keep updating multiplayer and come back in another 4-5 years with a new halo.  \n\n\nIf Microsoft keeps pushing out Halo games now it will just further the downward spiral. Halo needs a break and when it returns it needs to have a good cohesive story campaign and the same gameplay Halo fans have come to expect.\n\n## Comment ID l8416ge with +15 score by [(RubiconPizzaDelivery, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1dddnmx/the_coalition_did_with_gears_of_war_what_343/l8416ge/) (in reply to ID 1dddnmx):\nI literally just got called out cause I said maybe Chief's story should be allowed to end and we just expand the world with new stories and characters, so that's funny.\n\n\nI think refusing to retire your flagship character leads to a Star Wars like problem. The world shrinks a ton because it's a galaxy with a whole history and it revolves around these three assholes (Anakin, Luke, and Rey) or this big green virgin (Chief.)\n\n\nHalo has so much story to tell away from Chief but I feel like we'll never get it unless they just finish his story, either by retirement or death.\n\n### Comment ID l84coc6 with +3 score by [(Adamal123, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1dddnmx/the_coalition_did_with_gears_of_war_what_343/l84coc6/) (in reply to ID l8416ge):\nChief should’ve been kept on ice post Halo 3, hell, maybe even “retired” post Halo 4.\n\n#### Comment ID l85fa6m with +2 score by [(_Legoo_Maine_, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1dddnmx/the_coalition_did_with_gears_of_war_what_343/l85fa6m/) (in reply to ID l84coc6):\nCortana should've stayed dead and chief should've been training the next generation of Spartans in 5.

People regard stories without the chief at higher standards than Halo 4, 5 and 6, not because they don't have the chief in it, but because they are good stories on their own.\n\nHalo Wars 2 had a better story than 5 and Infinite combined and there was no Master Chief or Cortana.

Not to say he should turn out a chump like Luke Skywalker. \n\nWhat I'm saying is that the series has to acknowledge Master Chief's bigger than itself. \n\nThe Xbox Showcase had me thinking Age of Mythology, in which the protagonist dies and becomes a demi-god, guiding his son in the sequel.\n\nMaybe Master Chief could get a similar sort of treatment: \n\nThe Forward Unto Dawn (before Halo 4 threatens existence) can't sustain its life supports, so Cortana has to work her AI magic and save Chief's consciousness in Construct form.\n\nJust an example.

The Swords of Sanghelios map in H5 was to me, the best campaign map in the H4-6 lineup. \n\nI like where you’re going for prequel but the human side is set up already.

All the bullshit they came up with for 4 and 5, too much nonsense. Same thing with gears 4 and 5, nobody wants to fight robots neither in halo or gears.

Blows my mind when people write a story and can’t recognize when it isn’t good/exciting. MPwise, trying too hard to compete with COD. Halo is halo. All the best maps from halo 1, 2, and 3 that people continue playing to this day are ones that aren’t made for competitive CoD style MP 🤷🏽‍♂️. Halo infinite could have just imported remastered halo 2 maps and everyone would have liked all those maps better than the new stuff they came up with\n\n### Comment ID l846q2c with +1 score by [(VeterinarianSouth572, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1dddnmx/the_coalition_did_with_gears_of_war_what_343/l846q2c/) (in reply to ID l846ivv):\nYeah I remember I was disappointed with Halo 4 multiplayer and going back to Halo 3 and Reach multiplayer\n\n## Comment ID l84u5ic with +1 score by [(Johncurtisreeve, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1dddnmx/the_coalition_did_with_gears_of_war_what_343/l84u5ic/) (in reply to ID 1dddnmx):\nI don’t really get the sentiment like halo infinite was more or less a soft reboot and to me going back to the vibes of the first three halo games they had the Vanished, which are a basically instant replacement of the covenant and I thought they were cool, entirely on a halo, and they even brought back the aesthetics and art design of how things look in the original three games halo infinite looks more like the bungie  trilogy then four or five while combining the mechanics of the new and old games and making things far more grounded.

You’re not gonna have this franchise exist without him. The rumor about a Halo CE remake is probably true and it’s probably gonna resemble what Activision did with Modern Warfare 2019. The story has gone completely off the rails with Halo, there’s been no consistency or even really a story arc post-4. The franchise feels aimless and lost narratively. Our Gears E-Day is probably gonna be called Halo (2026). Right in time for the 25th anniversary. A fresh start that taps into the vibe of the original. Will it be good? Idk I really hope so!",

The only logical reasoning for majority of the posts I saw was, \"gears was released every 2 years, it's been 4 since gears 5\".\n\nI do not by any means consider myself an industry insider, so take what I have to say with a grain of salt, but I do try to reference as many sources as I can. I'm just been a life long gears fan, who reads gears news. \n\nI really hate to be the bearer of bad news, if we get a \"gears reveal\" it's not coming this year. \nStarfield is the game Microsoft is pushing this holiday season. \n\nhttps://gamerant.com/gears-war-3-delayed-microsoft-big-holiday-title\n\nIf we get shown gears, it's not coming until next Christmas at the earliest. \n\nThe Coalition has stated they are working on a new ip as well as \"the future of gears\" \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/teu8oc/rip_gears_esports_tc_working_on_the_future_of/\n\nIf it wasn't gears 6, I saw \"we are getting\" \"The Marcus Collection\" (we will probably never get) that would divide the studio between more projects. I would love to see Judgement on the proper gow3 control scheme. It probably won't happen though. \nJust for reference from the time TC was formed to the time Gears of war ultimate edition was released was about a year.\n\nLast may (about a year ago) TC announced all future projects will be developed with unreal engine 5. \nhttps://www.thecoalitionstudio.com/the-future-of-gears-5/\n\nWould you really want them to push out of 3-4 fully Remastered games in a brand new engine in about a year when the last one took them about a year to do? \n\nUpdate Gears of war a retrospective author talks about how \"a collection if it's coming is still a long way off\" \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/143fg49/gears_collection_and_ue_5_from_supervising_editor/\n\nI could be completely wrong on all of this and a part of me hopes that I am. I would really set that expectation bar low for gears at the showcase. Fable was also shown at a previous show, this is also likely the game Microsoft pushes next year. \n\nI expect this to be not a popular opinion, and down voted heavily.\n\nAlso no gears movie or TV trailers.\n\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-promises-no-full-cg-trailers-for-xbox-showcase-first-party-games\n\n## Comment ID jm9ve2t with +13 score by [(BChaps, Reddit, 2023-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/13w5llv/we_are_getting_gears_of_war_6_at_the_xbox/jm9ve2t/) (in reply to ID 13w5llv):\nTC doesn't even really have a Community Director or CM at this point.

That is it.  We are certainly not getting a gears of war game within the next 2 years, and if we do it'll be another low effort GaaS game like Halo Infinite and Gears 5, built overtime. \n\nPeople forget switching over to a new engine is at the very least 6 months to a year of training to be efficient at it, they struggled with decent content on the old engine they knew about let alone a new one.  The studio was also newly formed and that takes time to become cohesive and like clock work, not only that, but then they've gone and switched over to a new engine pipeline, technology also rapidly changes over short amounts of time in this industry.\n\nSo, yeah its likely in development now, but I wouldn't expect much.  A teaser with the logo and some minor visuals (literally a flash of visuals) is all we are likely to get, if not this year, then certainly within the next 2 years.   Remember, Fable has been in development for years, and they've still not shown it, its not even certain it'll show up at this most recent event.\n\nExpecting gameplay or a release date of Gears 6 is rather unrealistic, at most I expect a flash of Gears 6's logo, to let everyone know its in development and coming to build hype, because Xbox has been in dire straights as of late, I was even amazed at Halo even likely getting some air time for Season 4 trailer during the event.\n\nWith how redfall, Halo and Gears 5 turned out (not to be commercial successes day one) I can see them teasing Gears 6, but its equally as unlikely.\n\n### Comment ID jmkvd55 with +1 score by [(IamMovieMiguel, Reddit, 2023-06-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/13w5llv/we_are_getting_gears_of_war_6_at_the_xbox/jmkvd55/) (in reply to ID jmgiuhm):\nThank you!

Gears 4 had the ultimate disrespect of if you bought the $100 edition, all you got was access to maps a few days earlier than everyone else. They took so much shit, ultimate edition players got a permanent XP boost.\n\nGears 5 had a horrible launch. The Campaign Co-op was barely functional, and buggy as hell. The launch PvE locked the characters to classes. The classes were not balanced at all. You’d get kicked for even trying to bring a class that didn’t fit the meta. You could only bring Demo, Infiltrator, Mechanic, Jack, and maybe Veteran or Marksman, but those last 2 classes were underwhelming in the first few seasons, and barely output damage compared to the Demo, who spawned with GL and Boom. \n\nCertain classes had perks that didn’t benefit anything the class could do. Like, Pilot used to have increased walk speed, just random pieces that didn’t fit. The progression sucked ass. The skins weren’t even obtainable outside of saving up the Tour of Duty coins for a skin purchase. You could only afford maybe 1 skin per Tour, unless you want to come out of pocket. Reused maps, drip feed content, lack of urgency on fixing the problems. Horde was fucked the first few seasons. \n\nEscape was honestly a great fucking addition, but it suffered from the same balancing issues as Horde. I remember Master Escape being ridiculous. It launched with 3 characters, they nerfed Mac really hard early on, so a lot of times, you’d see tank Lahni doing the killing, and Keegan with explosive, then eventually all the Horde classes were added, and it added so much more freedom and creativity on how to tackle these Hives.\n\nI’d say by season 5, they finally hit their stride. The classes balance felt great, the Escape hives had grown to the point where if you never played it, there was a fuck ton of content to dive into. Horde was so much more improved to where to could run high level matches without relying on JD and Kait for offense, and picking your favorite class wasn’t counter to the meta. \n\nUnfortunately, by the time they get the game to the best state it’s ever been in, they pull the plug, and let it die while they cut their loses and move onto Gears 6. Gears 5 at its core is a great fucking game, with smooth controls and great gunplay, but why did I have to suffer 2 shit launches in a row, and invest an unnecessary amount of hours into both games, just for a “we’ll get it right next time” approach? \n\nGears is such a good franchise, and it deserves to be treated better than the Coalition have done.\n\n### Comment ID icpjyab with +10 score by [(Hiseworns, Reddit, 2022-06-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vea5qu/do_you_think_coalition_has_done_a_good_job_as/icpjyab/) (in reply to ID icp7m10):\nThis really sums it up.

I don’t think too many people remember how little damage you actually did as both Marksman and Veteran. \n\nYou pretty much sat there shooting marshmallows, while the JD just shook the screen with GL spam, and the Kait would grab an Overkill, and snipe everything with long range bleeding Overkill shots.\n\nYou can’t sustain a player base when you launch with such an unbalance. Once Pilot came along months later, Cold Finish made it way more viable to bring as support because fortifications bought by Pilot would freeze, on top of the Silverback being really good. Even then, the Silverback cards were broken and the Mulcher didn’t bleed for a few weeks or so after the class released.\n\nI stuck around because I love Gears, but not every player is sticking around to wait for the devs to get their shit together. Tail end of season 4 and the entire season 5 was probably the most fun I had, but the amount of torture I had to go through to get to the fun, was inexcusable. \n\nGears 6 needs PvE beta testing, and needs to cook for as long as possible. It’s crazy that out of all the 3rd person shooters I’ve played, Gears has the best controls and gunplay, but doesn’t get any attention because it keeps falling behind. They gotta do better, so much potential being wasted.\n\n### Comment ID icrm4i4 with +1 score by [(That-Hipster-Gal, Reddit, 2022-06-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vea5qu/do_you_think_coalition_has_done_a_good_job_as/icrm4i4/) (in reply to ID icp7m10):\nI wouldn't even say Gears 5 is in a good state when it comes to skins, too.

Then eventually they started adding in fan favorites by price gouging players with overpriced packs for a *chance* to get them. 4’s story was weak, characters just didn’t work (pretty much the gaming equivalent of the Force Awakens). Then 5, while making use of nostalgia with parts of the campaign, was pretty crap. “Open world” was just empty wastes of time, couldn’t stand Kait as the main character, and that ending “choice” is my personal pick for most laughably awful gaming moment.\n\n## Comment ID icqtdmv with +4 score by [(Chief_RedButt, Reddit, 2022-06-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vea5qu/do_you_think_coalition_has_done_a_good_job_as/icqtdmv/) (in reply to ID vea5qu):\nTC has fumbled the ball hard. Their inability to understand the player base is astounding. \n\n**TL;DR:** Had TC earnestly listened to the feedback on Gears 4, Gears 5 would have been a much better game and my optimism for Gears 6 would be through the roof. So much of Gears 5 at launch was a step back from 4 and seemed passive aggressive or tone deaf to the player base that I can’t help but feel it was done on purpose. Gears 6 has got to be an impressive experience that truly knocks it out of the park. \n\nGears 4’s biggest issue was loot boxes. Personally, I didn’t have a problem with it since *almost* every skin that came out of gear packs was eventually released to be crafted. Towards the end of the life cycle they did experiment with direct purchases that gave you the goodies from the gear packs for a flat fee. They were somewhat expensive, but it gave people a way to guarantee the skins they wanted and was a step in the right direction for loot going forward into Gears 5. \n\nGears 5 had a rotating FOMO based store that was price gouged to hell and offered little in the way of customization for *”free-to-play”* players of a $60 AAA game. Sure, you could get rinky dinky shit out of the supply (a continuously charging loot box with nothing of value in it), but all real customization was locked behind the store or the battle pass/challenges.\n\nGears 4’s campaign was serviceable and had the tone of OG Trilogy. Sure, the new kids weren’t as charming as Delta Squad or had bulging muscles spilling out of every crack in their armor, but in the context of the story, they weren’t supposed to be Delta. Del and JD grew up in a boarding school and served in a military that were glorified policemen. Kait lived out in the woods in a more civilized stranded society. None of these kids had seen the things their parents did. It’s acceptable for them to be rough around the edges when shit hits the fan. The atmosphere is dark but the main 3 try to stay light hearted as they are scared shitless. It works and makes the campaign feel like a continuation of the OG trilogy and not a new starting point. \n\nGears 5’s campaign has its issues. The story is okay, it’s not the perfect continuation of the previous story, but it works. The overall story is great, the personal story of Kait is awful. Kait’s biggest character trait is that she is kind of a bitch to everyone, but it’s never written as a character flaw that other characters take offense to, they just let it happen. It was excusable in 4 as her being scared and defensive, but in this game she is constantly surrounded by people trying to help her. This is compounded by the fact that we are **told** JD is off having cool adventures with Marcus and Fahz, adventures that are probably reminiscent of Gears gameplay we know and not empty “open world” collectathon environments we have to trudge through as Kait. Had the campaign had JD and his acceptance of being a leader as linear shoot-em-up sections mixed in with Kait and Del’s adventure into New Hope, JD’s story would have taken some of the edge off Kait’s angry romp through the snow. \n\nGears 4’s multiplayer is top notch. Some of the best versus I’ve had in a Gears game. Probably my favorite versus in the series. \n\nGears 5’s multiplayer is kind of eh. Sometimes it’s good, sometimes it isn’t. Very inconsistent. \n\nGears 4’s horde was a no brainer evolution on the previous horde. All people really wanted was more classes or better specialization.\n\nGears 5’s horde leans too much into the hero shooter genre, and takes one of the worst designs from it… abilities being locked behind certain characters (this also pigeonholed what characters could be released, as every character had to have a horde set, so some characters from the campaign weren’t available to be played as until **months** or **years** after release). This got fixed, but was way too late. Had horde 4.0 launched in its current state, maybe it would be my favorite horde. But it’s existence is marred by the lackluster launch. Escape was cool, but TC obviously had no real plans to support it and it died off fairly early.\n\n## Comment ID icqfuz1 with +7 score by [(hobo_erotica, Reddit, 2022-06-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vea5qu/do_you_think_coalition_has_done_a_good_job_as/icqfuz1/) (in reply to ID vea5qu):\nNo, they have failed this franchise. Their games have great graphics and the same gameplay as the past epic games, but their world building and writing have been god awful. The swarm and Deebees are, to be blunt, just plain dumb. Robots and a shittier version of the locust are not interesting villains. And speaking of villains, we don’t really have a big bad presence in 4 and 5. Reyna is the main boss but she’s barely had any lines, and the speaker was a budget version of raam. 4 started a potentially interesting story, but then 5 completely shit the bed. 5 essentially just states Kaits relationship to the locust and then has the “get the hammer online” quest. When 5 ends the characters are in the same place as they were at the start, it was an entire game of treading water. Oh yea, 5 also only had four acts when the tradition has been five acts. I feel like there was supposed to be an act with JD and Faz but TC was too lazy to make it.  \n\nThen there’s the terrible MP launches. I suppose the addition of micro transactions was inevitable, but the way TC drip fed us the content was despicable. How long did we have to wait to play as Dom, arguably the second most popular character, in multiplayer? The failure of the mapmaker and terribly slow output of new maps was really disappointing. At least they eventually overhauled the horde mechanics, but by then it was too little too late.\n\n## Comment ID icsm5fv with +3 score by [(Easy-Goat, Reddit, 2022-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vea5qu/do_you_think_coalition_has_done_a_good_job_as/icsm5fv/) (in reply to ID vea5qu):\nOP is asking for opinions.

Have they done a great job and helped the series take another step forward? No. \n\nI think the comment u/Relevant-Ad-8022 made sums it up perfectly that these games will never give us the same feelings as the originals. We're inching towards two decades of Gears. People have put thousands and thousands of hours into these games and the franchise in general. Coalition has basically only been tasked with keeping the franchise going and relevant. They've barely accomplished that. The games they have released have been met with mostly positive reviews and the fan base as a whole has enjoyed them even if they have still had issues with them. \n\nSo the question is, where does Gears go from here? I think Gears Tactics was a fantastic game and more time spent to flesh things out a bit more could really turn that into a viable second franchise as opposed to just a fun side game. As for the main series, I'm not really sure what the answer is. Gears still provides something that no other game out there can provide. The 3rd person, cover shooter experience is something that is still done way better with Gears than anything else. But how does that improve and become more relevant 15+ years later? I am not sure on this one but I do think there's a way that Gears can become one of the most prominent franchises and eSports again.\n\n## Comment ID icp3r09 with +2 score by [(Realistic-Dust-5891, Reddit, 2022-06-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vea5qu/do_you_think_coalition_has_done_a_good_job_as/icp3r09/) (in reply to ID vea5qu):\nI think TC has done an average job.

Map builder is a massive fucking example of a great idea that was horribly executed due to lack of development time.

I just can't wrap my head around the open world structure they were going for with that balloon ride thing in 5. That whole level is memorable in a very bad way. The rest of the game was decent and looked great, though. Both 4 and 5 campaigns are good. \n\nThe multiplayer is pretty great. I think there's still too much of a learning curve for alot of gamers. But, I'm glad that haven't dumbed it down. They added so much to it. More executions, emotes, skins, weapons, personality, etc. It remains the most versatile, action-filled multiplayer experience today.

I also see a lot of hate towards Pc players in general. I don't really get it. A problem with this franchise is the fact that the community can be ass not just towards Pc players but casuals as well. Makes it really hard for the games to grow. Something I would change about the current state of gears is to build the game around the fan's wants and needs and not go all-in on one specific group(Comp, Casual, etc.) Maybe this could be done if the community could really interact with the devs and help.\n\n## Comment ID icqnz3s with +1 score by [(Freak_OTRT, Reddit, 2022-06-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vea5qu/do_you_think_coalition_has_done_a_good_job_as/icqnz3s/) (in reply to ID vea5qu):\nI think they've done much better than 343 with Halo. \n\n5 was significantly better than 4 for sure but nothing really tops the OG trilogy, period.

It's been mostly fixed, but these things hurt the game.\n\nThe story is... Not the best. The bland characters mean you don't really get invested. \n\nJD in Gears 4 is basically just \"the son of Marcus Pheonix\" with very little to actually like. In 5 he gets sidelined after being wreckless, but never really letting us see how it affected him. We just have him show up, scarred and sort of grown. Addressing very little of his character development. \n\nKait, is interesting... At least in terms of how people react to her. We're given a little about her throughout 4 with who she is in the grander story being more important than trying to let the player get to know her. With how the story starts some time has passed since 4 in the 5th installment. It's s implied that her connection to the Locusts/Swarm has been progressing. This is where a lot of people really get lost in weeds on liking her or not. Most dislike her because they think she's a whining crybaby. I'm not going to say they're wrong. But if most of these people were put through the wringer like she has, they'd likely act similarly. Though we're given very little to like beyond some small moments, so regardless of the \"whining\" being justified or not, there's very little to like. \n\nDel is great as a secondary character. He's the supportive friend that has some tech knowledge. In 4 he's meh, while in 5 he's actually a much stronger character throughout. He even manages to get a few chuckles out of me in some cutscenes. Along with actually trying to talk about problems with his friends. He's one of the better new characters, as controversial of an opinion as that might be to some people.\n\nFahz... Uh he's apparently kind of popular. I don't really get it. He's an A-hole who turns out to not be as much on A-hole as your initially led to believe. Which isn't terrible, but similar to Del he fills his role well enough.\n\nIt's really funny that I loved the characters in hivebusters. They were actually fun and we'll written, on top of giving us a varied but short campaign. I loved it in general over the main story and it proves the devs can make a fun but somewhat serious story. \n\nOn top of the characters the story was just so... Meh. 4 was literally just a story to justify sequels, and 5 for some reason felt the need to explain the origin of the Locusts. Which kind of did very little for the story, and offered minimal real payoff when you can predict it in the first hour or so. \n\nThen the open world. Which basically just replaced the vehicle/turret sections, and didn't add much. But was the biggest addition to the campaign. It was honestly kind of disappointing, and made things just feel slow.\n\nFinally. One of the biggest reasons Gears in general hasn't really taken off, is the multiplayer. When it's 90% people just bouncing around with shotguns, mostly getting one-shot. You're either on of the few people that likes it, or you can't get into the multiplayer pretty much at all. As satisfying as it is once you get the hang of it, it's not for everyone. \n\nWhich is why I'm surprised horde doesn't get more love. I get that escape was added too, but I feel like multiplayer PvE content is  much more palatable to the vast majority of gamers when it comes to Gears. Because the alternative is \"fixing\" PvP to be more appealing to general audiences. Which would kill the game for its fans. \n\nIt's sad to say, but as fun and exciting as the game can be. It's just not being handled correctly by Microsoft and The Coalition.\n\n### Comment ID ichayxc with +8 score by [(javycane, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/ichayxc/) (in reply to ID icgrf62):\nYour last sentence sums it up lol.\n\n### Comment ID iciqanm with +4 score by [(FelledWolf, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/iciqanm/) (in reply to ID icgrf62):\nTo tack onto this, gears horde used to be where I can load a map and have a chatoic session with no having to prepare cards and classes and gather power.. those mechanics are not fun for me.

I have tons of friends that love shooters but won’t touch gears. \n\nIt’s very punishing for beginner players and isn’t that intuitive when it comes to movement and gunplay. There are third person games like fortnite that have much more verticality and run and gun style movement with zero reliance on a cover system. There’s other third person cover shooters that are slower and more tactically paced. \n\nGears has a weird spot in the middle. Grounded gameplay with extremely twitchy run and cover gameplay. Watch an absolute sweat play the game, and it looks like they’re having a stroke between walls and one-shotting everyone.\n\nThe biggest gears fans are people that have been playing the game since forever ago.

I've been playing since 2006.  \n\nGears 4/5 had an AWFUL launch where we were literally dip fed content for months.  Gears 4 was basically unplayable on PC unless you were using 2 year old graphics drivers.  The new series (imo) has a much less exciting campaign which doesn't draw in new players.  I can't convince my friends to play the series even though I'm absolutely in love with it because they have no way to play it on PC and none of us have picked up a controller in about a decade.  \n\nThey need to come out swinging with a collection of the first 3 games like MCC did.  No issues, ALL the content of those games and more.  Then they need to hype/advertise the absolutely shit out of Gears 6 (none of that bury a friend trailer bullshit, something like the Gears 3 ashes to ashes/dust to dust, or Gears 4 tomorrow trailer that make you feel actual emotion) and the game needs to actually be good enough to back up the hype.  \n\nHalo was able to make some sort of a comeback.

The cover-based shooting was relatively groundbreaking when the series launched but is nothing special now. If anything, game movement and combat feel a little outdated and clunky compared to other modern titles.\n\nCampaigns of 4 and 5 were lackluster (both in writing and gameplay) compared to previous titles - and multiplayer, both Horde and especially PvP are pretty niche. (This isn't to say any of the above are *bad*. I personally played a lot of Horde and enjoyed going through the campaign with a friend).\n\nRecent titles don't have the gore or intensity that contributed to the franchises unique atmosphere.\n\nOn top of all of this, while the original title(s) were huge in their own right, I don't know that they ever held the mass appeal of other major titles.\n\n### Comment ID icgpkw0 with +3 score by [(TierceK, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/icgpkw0/) (in reply to ID icgjvln):\nHm, lackluster is a pretty good term to describe the campaigns instead of bad which they are not.\n4 had a great prologue.

Some objective, some subjective.\n\nFirst off I think this series has plateud in quality. IMO the biggest drop in quality is the campaign. It's bland and forgettable. We have a whiny protag who gets pulled along and makes selfish decisions. Dom breaking Marcus out of prison already kinda attaches me to this chad who broke me out. Also, there is much less care put towards the gritty gore nature of combat. Cement chunks don't come off low walls, guts don't stay on the floor, you name it. Gritty, gore, and guts was what differentiated this game from CoD. You look at a bunch of games trailers and GoW 1-3 stood out because of that. And now it's just very bland generic looking less thick people shooting at each other. Wooptido. And guess what our next quest is? Is it a hammer of dawn related mission? Is grass green? The game gets rid of epic setpiece moments like riding a brumak or a whole campaign inside a worm in favor of open world. You get a discount black guy who might as well not exist. And let's just accept the fact that they likely can't beat the original trilogy's characters or story.\n\nSecond, barely any innovation. Maybe someone will argue about this. But gears 5 looks like it went backward 2 notches. Sure the graphics are nicer, but 1 to 2 to 3 were slapping the crap out of the gaming space when it comes to innovative gameplay. First time you blew up a guy with a wall nade was fun AF. I hated the server advantage back then but boy was it fun. We also got horde mode long time ago. What new came out after? Now its just the same rehashed multiplayer with microtransacrions.\n\nThird, the decline of Xbox. Microsoft dropped the ball on the Xbox One and so there's just less people interested in Microsoft exclusives.\n\nSadly, Halo is also suffering the same problems today. Much the same problems also. Halo Infinite campaign is so bland I don't know if I can keep listening to the monkey make a speech for the 100th time. Ah guess what Halo got though! oPeN wOrLd gAmEpLaY\n\n### Comment ID icgvbi8 with +4 score by [(TierceK, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/icgvbi8/) (in reply to ID icgbg8d):\nInteresting post.\n\nDisagree about campaign, although agree about Del not being utilized enough and some more set pieces would be cool.\n\nStrongly disagree about gameplay. The chain melees, pulling someone over cover, new weapons, improved sprinting or rowdy-run, playable jack, classes, and escape all are new additions which still fit the Gears feeling. Drastic changes like taking away the cover-base system would only make this not feel like Gears anymore.\n\nStrongly agree about the decline of Xbox.

Even a fairly well-supported game like Gears 5 is naturally gonna peter off after a while\n\n* I don't want to say it's 'outdated' or anything, but... most of the gaming world has kind of moved on from the third person cover shooter. Gears is the only one left, really. It was a huge trend back then but it's just not that popular anymore. The gameplay doesn't really have the same kind of infinitely replayable appeal as something like Fortnite or Destiny.\n\n* On a related note, one could argue that the gaming mainstream is kind of 'over' Gears in general - it was hot shit in the late noughties, but the hype's fizzled out a bit as tastes and trends have evolved. Gears 4 and 5 were well received, but I don't think they were really bringing in newer crowds\n\n* Too much competition - there are tons of online multiplayer games being released and updated all the time, all fighting for your attention. Back in the Gears 1-3 days there wasn't nearly as much, online console gaming was still in its early years and was still very novel. You had a lot of copycats but Gears was up there and arguably instrumental in the dominance of the 360 at the time. It's not really the case anymore. Even the latest Halo is 'struggling'\n\n## Comment ID ich9k2s with +2 score by [(MrDysprosium, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/ich9k2s/) (in reply to ID vcttwn):\nWall Bouncing is too niche and unintuitive of a mechanic for the average player to bother investing time into, but without learning that tech, you'll always be less competitive that the typical Gears player.\n\nIt's the same reason Fortnite did away with Building.\n\nSure, it adds depth to the game, but if the average player doesn't want to engage with your super-unique , yet core-to-the-experience mechanic... you either lose that player or you chose to do away with the mechanic.\n\nGoW needs to do away with rapid wall bouncing if they ever want to be big again.,\n\n## Comment ID ichwwy1 with +2 score by [(Hour_Toe_2253, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/ichwwy1/) (in reply to ID vcttwn):\nI love posts like this.

A big hurtle with gears games is that movement is just as important as aim. Often people may get turned off to the wall bouncing when underneath it all it’s great for mixing up opponents and is very useful for positioning. I think people who play fighting games can appreciate this aspect of the game.

I think a majority of the issue is Gears has always faced is that it’s a very niche game. Over the shoulder shooters just aren’t as popular as FPS. Not to mention the story and lore coincide with that. That mad the fan base very first hard and loyal and I think when gears 5 came out everything from dropping “of war” and making things pay to play instead of being able to grind for everything just felt like they sold out to try to appeal to groups that never cared anyways. Gameplay wise it’s pretty damn good but they no doubt alienated a lot of franchise long fans in their approach to this one unfortunately.

Imo given the whole series has been about Marcus dealing with loss and sacrifice this would be my preferred way to handle a last mainline game (if 6 were to be the last mainline title).\n\nCould put it back in Kaits shoes and have her be the one to put an end to her mums wrath.\n\nOr could flesh out Del and make the 3rd member who's been the best bro the previous 2 games the lead, flesh him out more and show why everyone seems to like him.\n\nThing with JD is it doesn't seem there's anywhere left for him to do narratively speaking. You could give him a redemption story but that's a bit generic and it's more interesting to me if he doesn't get that redemption, he fucked up trying to live up to the family name and if he stays dead then that's just the price to pay for making the mistakes he did. Gears of war isn't a happy go lucky series, if he's the canon death then I think it's fitting.\n\n### Comment ID j991qln with +8 score by [(brandonsay-e, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j991qln/) (in reply to ID j98zbop):\nCouldn’t agree more 100% thought the same outline!\n\n### Comment ID j993eke with +8 score by [(xxWolfMan1313xx, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j993eke/) (in reply to ID j98zbop):\nThey focus a lot on the dead body sliding down into the cracked ground and the fact that you don’t even need to be alive to be turned ie the queen. I’d love a JD swarm like character that you don’t know it’s him throughout the beginning of the game cause he’s wearing a helmet. Then midway through he pulls it off to reveal it’s him. Then Marcus and him have a duel with the cleavers from Gears 3. Also if Del is the one dead and swarmed then it can be brother vs brother. That’s just my take on it\n\n#### Comment ID j99gotk with +2 score by [(KidCuda, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j99gotk/) (in reply to ID j993eke):\nI never thought of that!

Men like Marcus and Dom are the men on the ground who suffer from the stress and strain of the machine that is war (it's why they're called 'COGs' and 'Gears'). Marcus is a man who must go through hardship, he is moulded by, shaped by it, and as hard as he tried in Gears 4 he can't escape it; but his character is one who emerges from it. \n\nIn Gears 1 he returns from prison and climbs to the rank of sergeant and leadership, earning his place and respect from others. In 2 he must overcome the loss of his friend (Tai), and his charge (Ben Carmine), and watch his best friend finally reunite with their wife only to euthanise her, before sacrificing the last bastion of ordered civilisation they've known (Jacinto) to stop the Locust...only for it to fail. In 3 he loses his best friend, and later a father he had thought long dead, and then in 4 we learn Anya died and the locust have returned. By JD dying in 5, it fits with the theme of suffering that Marcus constantly endures but no matter the suffering he endures and rises - there's a reason his last name is \"Fenix\" after all. The interesting thing going forward will be is this the thing that finally breaks him, or will he rise again to carry on? \n\nAlso killing JD allows for John Dimaggio an amazing performance, I was dreading the scene leading up to it and was dam near tears; a great blend of subtly and weight behind it.\n\n## Comment ID j98vq10 with +18 score by [(PovasTheOne, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j98vq10/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nI’d like for this stupidity to be retcon and for both characters to be alive in the next game.

So because of that, most people picked JD just because of Marcus connection. in general, i found the whole scene stupid, neither of them should have died there. \"The Coalition\" studio has failed to capture fans with GOW 4 and 5 like the original trilogy did. Which is why the deaths in Gow 4 and 5 are meaningless tbh. Benjamin Carmine death in gow 2 was more emotional and more ppl cared for him after just a couple of hours of gameplay than players do for Del, JD, Kait, etc after 2 full games.\n\n## Comment ID j996aq9 with +19 score by [(ReactiveCypress, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j996aq9/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nI still don't really get why they did this. Gears has never been a Mass Effect like series with decisions to make like this. So now they either have to make two different campaigns based on what decision was made, or render it all pointless by making one of the deaths cannon. Personally, I think JD surviving should be the cannon choice. His rise, fall, and rise again is a much more interesting story, and they can't keep letting Marcus lose his people. Plus there's a lot of parallels between Del dying and Dom dying which can bring Marcus and JD closer.\n\n### Comment ID j99l9bp with +3 score by [(lecherousdevil, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j99l9bp/) (in reply to ID j996aq9):\nThat's my thoughts really.

He clearly has more arc to be told. We are shown he has flaws and recklessness that , while “worked out” with the launching the missile on azura- it did not with the convey/Lizzie. Marcus is very critical of him and he’s struggling to live in Marcus and Anya footsteps . His recklessness affected Baird by forcing his hand with the hammer of dawn - a wound that’s still open. He lied about his involvement with settlement 2. \n\nDel was his best friend - his death hits him hard and becomes the catalyst to getting him back on “the good path” while also bringing JD and Marcus closer together.\n\nDels death cutscenes felt more authentic too. First we get a Marcus and JD heart to heart .  Something JD has wanted since gears 4. Kaits way of saying “he was my friend too” resonated well given their bond from mount katar. We also get a moment of remorse from Fauz when he realized del is gone.\n\nDels story was told- he’s the charismatic best friend - he was there for Kait when she needed someone . He inadvertently brought the whole squad together to mourn his death. \n\nI think either JD surviving is canon or Gears has two campaigns to account for both scenarios (really hope they don’t do this)\n\n5% of me also thinks they keep del alive as canon cause “shock factor” which would be stupid too\n\n## Comment ID j99le0j with +3 score by [(Evergladeleaf, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j99le0j/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nI’m gonna say it, I didn’t like James as a character, though del was a more fun companion and more interesting character\n\nIn a perfect world it’s revealed that no one actually died, but I chose James to die on every playthrough\n\n### Comment ID j9czlas with +3 score by [(VionValor, Reddit, 2023-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j9czlas/) (in reply to ID j99le0j):\nJames was such a dick in this game too lol\n\n## Comment ID j9bh66c with +5 score by [(george_reeves_, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j9bh66c/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nI picked JD to live, I couldn’t do that to Marcus\n\n## Comment ID j98zuft with +8 score by [(Krakatorn, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j98zuft/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nThey could pull a Wolfenstein and have branching storylines.\n\n### Comment ID j99456k with +11 score by [(xxWolfMan1313xx, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j99456k/) (in reply to ID j98zuft):\nThis, this is what I would like kinda. The beginning of the game Kait can have a flashback to that day and you rechoose who dies. Depending on who you choose is how the game then plays out.\n\nSo my thing is when the character dies it kinda focus’s on the body sliding into the rubble. Then thinking about how you don’t even need to be alive to be turned into the swarm ie the queen that got me thinking.\n\nSo what if she has a new general in the next game. He wears a helmet and you don’t see his face throughout the beginning. Well midway through you come to a point where he removes his helmet revealing it to be either JD or Del in a Swarm like form.\n\nNow if it’s JD the game plays out more brutal. The Swarm are more bloodthirsty and savage. If it’s Del then they are more technologically savvy and really outsmart the player.\n\nAt the point of the reveal if JD, Marcus is stunned to know his son is somewhat alive. If Del, then JD is stunned. Then comes the one on one battle with cleavers.

It's her \"Dom's sacrifice\" moment, where she has to process the loss of her friend, swallow her grief, and fight on.

From a narrative stand-point, it makes more sense. \n\nDel is in the game far more than JD. Del's relationship with everyone makes it more impactful. He's Kait's best friend, especially during the temporary break-up with JD. He's Baird's protégé. He's a second son to Marcus. He's JD's brother. He's JACK's controller, which makes JACK's sacrifice way more emotional if he did it to avenge Del. \n\nPlus, Del's death is what completes Marcus and JD's arc. Marcus was unable to properly grieve Anya with JD and instead sent him to a boarding school. JD is now able to be vulnerable and ask for his father's love, and Marcus is now able to be there for his son when he loses his brother. It repairs their relationship. \n\nJD's death accomplishes nothing narrative-wise and leaves Marcus and JD's arcs unresolved. It's also a very much unneeded emotional toll on Marcus. He lost his parents, his brothers, his friends, his wife, and NOW his only son? No. He doesn't need that much suffering.\n\n## Comment ID j9d1v1w with +1 score by [(Redhood_Ranger, Reddit, 2023-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j9d1v1w/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nListen I like both characters but Marcus went through enough, JD being the canon death would be Marcus’ 13th reason why\n\n## Comment ID j9d4k7p with +1 score by [(BigPapaTubes, Reddit, 2023-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j9d4k7p/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nI would like if there was a third tentacle for kait, and the only option was that all three die.

If he dies here we'll miss out on a wealth of JD story building. \n\nI'm sadder by the idea of losing Del but I think that's the way it was supposed to feel.\n\n## Comment ID j9h3h85 with +1 score by [(RagtagVenom, Reddit, 2023-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j9h3h85/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nWould it not be who you actually saved??\n\n## Comment ID j9jk7bv with +1 score by [(esreverflash, Reddit, 2023-02-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j9jk7bv/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nI saved JD but I feel like they did a very poor job adding to his character in Gears 5, his character development and relationship with Marcus and Kait was arguably better in Gears 4 and in 5 they just paint him as the bad guy which doesn’t make sense. Marcus fought in the original war and knew it took sacrifice and hard decision making to win and guarantee a chance for humanity, yet his son decides to stop a violent protest and that’s where he draws the Line.",

It's an amazingly fun, spiritual horror Adventure that a lot of people are missing out.\n\n## Comment ID mk7gzr7 with +1 score by [(guitar_blade, Reddit, 2025-03-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyCanadian/comments/1ide4ud/canadian_made_video_games/mk7gzr7/) (in reply to ID 1ide4ud):\nNobody Saves The World by Drink Box Studios is a great game.

      "# [People Can Fly is working on Gears of War again by Alex Calvin on 2025-01-29](https://www.pcgamesinsider.biz/news/74939/people-can-fly-is-working-on-gears-of-war-again/)\nPolish games firm People Can Fly is once again working on the Gears of War series.\n\nIn a post on its website, the studio said that it was going to be contributing to the upcoming Gears of War: E-Day with Xbox first-party studio The Coalition. People Can Fly previously led development on 2013's Gears of War: Judgment, as well as helping out on the first three numbered entries in the sci-fi shooter franchise.\n\n“Returning to collaborate on the next chapter of this legendary saga is both a privilege and an exciting opportunity to build upon the intense, visceral action and rich storytelling that fans have come to love,\" People Can Fly CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski (pictured) said.\n\n\"We are deeply grateful for our partners’ trust and support on this journey.\"\n\nThe Coalition's studio head Mike Crump added: “Gears of War: E-Day is not just our next major game; it’s a return to what makes Gears of War games special and authentic. We’re pleased to be partnering with the talented folks at People Can Fly who have been a part of our franchise’s legacy for so long.”\n\nPeople Can Fly cut over 150 jobs during 2024.",
      "# [Outriders dev People Can Fly shares some good news as it returns to the Gears of War series to help The Coalition develop E-Day by Sherif Saed on 2025-01-28](https://www.vg247.com/gears-of-war-e-day-people-can-fly-new-development-partner)\nThe next big Gears of War game was revealed at last summer’s Xbox Games Showcase. It’s called Gears of War: E-Day, and it acts as a prequel to the events of the core series, depicting the chaos of the eponymous Emergence Day.\n\nWhile we’ve always known that Microsoft’s The Coalition studio is developing the game, today’s announcement reveals that it has one hell of a partner in People Can Fly.\n\nAnyone familiar with Gears of War, or even the classic PC shooter scene, will be very familiar with People Can Fly. The Polish studio’s history with the Gears series extends as far back as the first game, having contributed to all three mainline games.\n\nThe studio was later given an opportunity to develop its own spin-off in Gears of War: Judgment, which sadly isn’t as well remembered today. Before that, it created Bulletstorm. The studio's most recent game is Outriders and its expansion.\n\n“Returning to collaborate on the next chapter of this legendary saga is both a privilege and an exciting opportunity to build upon the intense, visceral action and rich storytelling that fans have come to love,” said studio CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski.\n\nThe Coalition, for its part, was enthusiastic about this partnership. Studio head Mike Crump added that “Gears of War: E-Day is not just our next major game; it’s a return to what makes Gears of War games special and authentic.”\n\nThis is good news for fans of People Can Fly, which has been having a rough go of it in recent years. The studio creates excellent shooters, but they just can’t seem to find a big enough audience for continued investment. More recently, the developer laid off over 120 developers as it scaled back development of an unannounced project, and suspended its self-publishing plans.\n\nWhile Gears of War: E-Day may not be the next new thing from People Can Fly, it at least means the studio will remain in business for a while longer, which will hopefully be enough to secure a brighter future for one of the most talented studios in the industry.\n\n“Our team at People Can Fly, made up of dedicated Gears of War fans, is pouring everything we have into creating an experience that will exceed expectations,” People Can Fly development director, Guillaume Barry, added.\n\n“While we can’t share more just yet, we’re eager for the day when we can show all the exciting things we’ve been working on” – says Guillaume Barry, Development Director at PCF.\n\nGears of War: E-Day does not have a release target, but some suggested it could be released as early as this year - though that seems unlikely.",
      "# [People Can Fly And The Coalition Reunite For Gears Of War: E-Day by Vaspaan Dastoor on 2025-01-28](https://www.thegamer.com/gears-of-war-e-day-people-can-fly-the-coalition-reunite/)\nSummary\n\nGears of War: E-Day is a prequel focusing on Emergence Day with Marcus and Dom returning, aiming for a release this year.\n\nThe Coalition and People Can Fly previously worked together on the first three games.\n\nPeople can't really fly.\n\nWe haven't heard much about Gears of War: E-Day ever since it was announced. All we know is that it's a prequel which will focus on the events of Emergence Day, John DiMaggio and Carlos Ferro will return to play the roles of Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago respectively, and that the game is aiming to release this year.\n\nSpeaking of reuniting the old guard, it seems developer The Coalition will be reunited with People Can Fly, which was the co-development partner on Gears of War 1, 2, and 3, and was the lead on Gears of War: Judgment.\n\nTalk About Forming A Coalition\n\nPeople Can Fly CEO, Sebastian Wojciechowski made a statement about the partnership on the developer's blog. \"Returning to collaborate on the next chapter of this legendary saga is both a privilege and an exciting opportunity to build upon the intense, visceral action and rich storytelling that fans have come to love,\" he said. \"We are deeply grateful for our partners’ trust and support on this journey.”\n\n\"Gears of War: E-Day is not just our next major game; it’s a return to what makes Gears of War games special and authentic,\" added The Coalition studio head, Mike Crump. \"We’re pleased to be partnering with the talented folks at People Can Fly who have been a part of our franchise’s legacy for so long.”\n\nThe exact nature of the partnership hasn't been discussed, but it will be interesting to see what the two studios can cook up, especially after the success of the first three games. Hopefully, the two will be able to capture the same magic.",
      "# [Bulletstorm and Painkiller devs People Can Fly to co-develop Gears of War: E-Day, following spate of layoffs and cancellations last year by Nic Reuben on 2025-01-28](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulletstorm-and-painkiller-devs-people-can-fly-to-co-develop-gears-of-war-e-day-following-spate-of-layoffs-and-cancellations-last-year)\nPainkiller, Bulletstorm, and Outriders studio People Can Fly will be co-developing Gears Of War: E-Day, the upcoming shooter in the long-running series of games about large men doing large violence at large bugs from behind medium walls. This is good news! People Can Fly have a pedigree for serving chunky gun chutney with a smile. They've also worked extensively on the series before, notably Judgement Day. E-Day itself is aiming to have a pronounced horror slant, with the 'Emergence Day' of the title referring to the insectoid Locust's first visit above ground.\n\nThis is good news, also, because last year was a fraught one for People Can Fly. Back in January, we learned from an email obtained by Kotaku that the Polish studio were laying off 30 people, alongside 20 people being moved from an unannounced Square Enix project named Gemini. They cancelled another project - a co-op action RPG named Project Dagger - in April. Last December, they parted wallets with a further 120 workers, shelved one project, and downsized another. \"We are redoubling our efforts with new work for hire engagements and focusing on the development of a single independent game,\" said chief executive officer Sebastian Wojciechowski at the time.\n\nI've enjoyed every People Can Fly game I've played, including Outriders - an excellent shooter, albeit one buried under a clumpy mountain of pre-peed live service cat litter. As for E-Day, it's primed to be a soft series reboot of sorts. \"Gears of War: E-Day is not just our next major game; it’s a return to what makes Gears of War games special and authentic,\" said The Coalition studio head Mike Crump in a press release. \"We’re pleased to be partnering with the talented folks at People Can Fly who have been a part of our franchise’s legacy for so long.”",

The Microsoft first-party studio behind the series since 2015, The Coalition, is once again taking the lead development role for the project. Today, it was revealed that People Can Fly will be a co-developer for the project.\n\n\"People Can Fly is thrilled to be working on Gears of War: E-Day, the next mainline game in the renowned Gears of War series, as a co-development partner with The Coalition,\" says the company in a press release. \"We are honored to return to the world of Gears of War, a franchise deeply embedded in our studio’s history.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time that the Polish game studio has been involved in the Gears of War franchise. The studio helped with the development of the original trilogy when Epic Games was in charge of things. People Can Fly also developed the Xbox 360-exclusive spin-off Gears of War: Judgment. The 2013-released title offered a prequel storyline following Damon Baird and Augustus Cole set prior to the events that had Marcus Fenix being freed.\n\n\"Our team at People Can Fly, made up of dedicated Gears of War fans, is pouring everything we have into creating an experience that will exceed expectations,\" says People Can Fly development director Guillaume Barry. \"While we can’t share more just yet, we’re eager for the day when we can show all the exciting things we’ve been working on.\n\n\"Gears of War: E-Day is not just our next major game; it’s a return to what makes Gears of War games special and authentic.

      "# [Gears of War Collection, E-Day Release Plans Narrowed Down in New Leak by John Bonelli, Eric Law, Ritwik Mitra, Mohsen Baqery, Raul Landaverde, Aaron McKinley, Matt Karoglou on 2025-03-04](https://gamerant.com/gears-of-war-collection-e-day-release-plans-leak/)\nSummary\n\nAccording to a new leak. Gears of War: E-Day will be released sometime in 2026.\n\nA rumored Gears of War collection may drop later in 2025 to take its place.\n\nMore concrete information may be revealed during an Xbox showcase this summer.\n\nAn industry leaker suggests that Gears of War: E-Day will be released in 2026, and a Gears of War collection will drop later in 2025 to take its place. Gears of War: E-Day was first revealed as part of Xbox's impressive game showcase last June with a nostalgic and sentimental cinematic trailer. A prequel to the original trilogy, Gears of War: E-Day will focus on franchise icon Marcus Fenix and his friendship with fan-favorite COG Dom Santiago on Emergence Day. While the trailer wasn't followed by a release window, rumors suggested it was aiming for a late 2025 release.\n\nEven before Gears of War: E-Day was revealed in 2024, a Halo: The Master Chief Collection-style remastered anthology had been part of the Xbox rumor mill for quite some time. Over the past year, there has been a string of rumors and small pieces of evidence that suggest a Gears of War collection is in the works. In June, Gears of War 2 and 3 musical composer Steve Jablonsky updated the thumbnails of both games' soundtracks on YouTube with The Coalition's studio logo, with both games originally developed by Epic Games. This led to more speculation about a Gears of War collection, as did Phil Spencer's recent revisiting of the earlier Gears games on Xbox this past January.\n\nNow, even more leaked info has come out about both Gears of War: E-Day and the potential Gears of War collection. Spanish leaker eXtas1s posted a new video to YouTube in which he mentioned that Gears of War: E-Day is looking to release in 2026, not 2025 as prior rumors suggested. In its place, he says the Gears of War collection will be revealed at the upcoming June Xbox showcase and released at some point later in 2025 for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5 as well, corroborating others' rumors about Xbox's new multiplatform strategy touching the brand's most sacred first-party franchises. eXtas1s was recently correct in his Forza Horizon 5 to PS5 rumors, so his new Gears claims do hold some weight.\n\nLeaker Suggests Gears Collection Will Drop This Year for PS5, E-Day to Release in 2026\n\nIt would make sense for the Gears of War collection to be released on PS5, as it'll allow gamers on that platform the opportunity to grow familiar with the characters before jumping back in time with Gears of War: E-Day, which may also wind up on PS5 at some point down the road. While unknown, the Gears of War collection could consist of the 2015 Gears of War: Ultimate Edition remaster alongside new remastered versions of Gears of War 2 and 3. Whether the 2013 spinoff Gears of War: Judgment or either of the more recent Kait Diaz-led sequels make it into the collection is also still a mystery.",

    "# Comprehensive Analyst Report on The Coalition and Gears of War: E-Day\n\n## Company Overview: The Coalition\n\nThe Coalition is a Microsoft first-party studio based in Vancouver, Canada, primarily known for its work on the Gears of War franchise since 2014. The studio has taken the lead on developing the series after Epic Games, the original creator, transitioned away from the project. The Coalition has been instrumental in revitalizing the franchise, focusing on delivering high-quality gaming experiences that resonate with both new and veteran players.\n\n## Product Overview: Gears of War: E-Day\n\nGears of War: E-Day is the upcoming installment in the Gears of War series, acting as a prequel to the original trilogy. The game will explore the events of Emergence Day, a pivotal moment in the franchise's lore, and will feature iconic characters Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago. The game is being developed using Unreal Engine 5, which promises enhanced graphics and gameplay mechanics.\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n- **Co-Development Partnership**: The Coalition has partnered with Polish studio People Can Fly to co-develop Gears of War: E-Day. This collaboration marks a return for People Can Fly, which previously contributed to the original Gears of War trilogy and led the development of Gears of War: Judgment. People Can Fly CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski expressed excitement about the partnership, stating, “Returning to collaborate on the next chapter of this legendary saga is both a privilege and an exciting opportunity to build upon the intense, visceral action and rich storytelling that fans have come to love” [(Calvin, PCGamesInsider, 2025-01-29)](https://www.pcgamesinsider.biz/news/74939/people-can-fly-is-working-on-gears-of-war-again/).\n\n- **Game Focus and Features**: Gears of War: E-Day will delve into the chaos of Emergence Day, with a narrative that aims to capture the essence of what makes Gears of War special. The Coalition's studio head Mike Crump emphasized that the game is “not just our next major game; it’s a return to what makes Gears of War games special and authentic” [(Saed, VG247, 2025-01-28)](https://www.vg247.com/gears-of-war-e-day-people-can-fly-new-development-partner).\n\n- **Release Timeline**: While initial rumors suggested a release in late 2025, recent leaks indicate that Gears of War: E-Day may actually launch in 2026. In the meantime, a Gears of War collection is rumored to be released in 2025, potentially serving as a lead-up to E-Day [(Bonelli et al., Gamerant, 2025-03-04)](https://gamerant.com/gears-of-war-collection-e-day-release-plans-leak/).\n\n## Company Scale and Challenges\n\nThe Coalition has been scaling its operations, but the gaming industry remains competitive. People Can Fly, despite its pedigree, faced significant challenges in 2024, including layoffs of over 150 employees and the cancellation of multiple projects. This partnership with The Coalition may provide a much-needed boost to their business and creative output [(Saed, VG247, 2025-01-28)](https://www.vg247.com/gears-of-war-e-day-people-can-fly-new-development-partner).\n\n## Executive Insights\n\n- **Sebastian Wojciechowski**, CEO of People Can Fly, highlighted the importance of this collaboration, stating, “We are deeply grateful for our partners’ trust and support on this journey” [(Calvin, PCGamesInsider, 2025-01-29)](https://www.pcgamesinsider.biz/news/74939/people-can-fly-is-working-on-gears-of-war-again/).\n  \n- **Guillaume Barry**, Development Director at People Can Fly, noted the dedication of their team, saying, “Our team at People Can Fly, made up of dedicated Gears of War fans, is pouring everything we have into creating an experience that will exceed expectations” [(Romano, Gematsu, 2025-01-27)](https://www.gematsu.com/2025/01/gears-of-war-e-day-co-developed-by-people-can-fly).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Coalition is poised to continue its legacy with Gears of War: E-Day, leveraging its partnership with People Can Fly to enhance the game's development. As the gaming landscape evolves, the collaboration may not only revitalize the Gears of War franchise but also provide stability for People Can Fly amidst its recent challenges. Investors and prospective candidates should monitor the developments closely, particularly regarding the release timeline and the potential impact of the Gears of War collection on the franchise's visibility and market performance."
