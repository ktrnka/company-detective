The only logical reasoning for majority of the posts I saw was, \"gears was released every 2 years, it's been 4 since gears 5\".\n\nI do not by any means consider myself an industry insider, so take what I have to say with a grain of salt, but I do try to reference as many sources as I can. I'm just been a life long gears fan, who reads gears news. \n\nI really hate to be the bearer of bad news, if we get a \"gears reveal\" it's not coming this year. \nStarfield is the game Microsoft is pushing this holiday season. \n\nhttps://gamerant.com/gears-war-3-delayed-microsoft-big-holiday-title\n\nIf we get shown gears, it's not coming until next Christmas at the earliest. \n\nThe Coalition has stated they are working on a new ip as well as \"the future of gears\" \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/teu8oc/rip_gears_esports_tc_working_on_the_future_of/\n\nIf it wasn't gears 6, I saw \"we are getting\" \"The Marcus Collection\" (we will probably never get) that would divide the studio between more projects. I would love to see Judgement on the proper gow3 control scheme. It probably won't happen though. \nJust for reference from the time TC was formed to the time Gears of war ultimate edition was released was about a year.\n\nLast may (about a year ago) TC announced all future projects will be developed with unreal engine 5. \nhttps://www.thecoalitionstudio.com/the-future-of-gears-5/\n\nWould you really want them to push out of 3-4 fully Remastered games in a brand new engine in about a year when the last one took them about a year to do? \n\nUpdate Gears of war a retrospective author talks about how \"a collection if it's coming is still a long way off\" \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/143fg49/gears_collection_and_ue_5_from_supervising_editor/\n\nI could be completely wrong on all of this and a part of me hopes that I am. I would really set that expectation bar low for gears at the showcase. Fable was also shown at a previous show, this is also likely the game Microsoft pushes next year. \n\nI expect this to be not a popular opinion, and down voted heavily.\n\nAlso no gears movie or TV trailers.\n\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-promises-no-full-cg-trailers-for-xbox-showcase-first-party-games\n\n## Comment ID jm9ve2t with +14 score by [(BChaps, Reddit, 2023-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/13w5llv/we_are_getting_gears_of_war_6_at_the_xbox/jm9ve2t/) (in reply to ID 13w5llv):\nTC doesn't even really have a Community Director or CM at this point.

It’s really pointless to beg and cry over something that won’t happen. I don’t anticipate anything about Gears 6.

What's even the point if the OG trilogy as well as Judgment have increased resolution and framerate on Series S and X.

Gears of War 3 still looks sharp even after 12 years. Judgment holds up after 10 years.

That is it.  We are certainly not getting a gears of war game within the next 2 years, and if we do it'll be another low effort GaaS game like Halo Infinite and Gears 5, built overtime. \n\nPeople forget switching over to a new engine is at the very least 6 months to a year of training to be efficient at it, they struggled with decent content on the old engine they knew about let alone a new one.  The studio was also newly formed and that takes time to become cohesive and like clock work, not only that, but then they've gone and switched over to a new engine pipeline, technology also rapidly changes over short amounts of time in this industry.\n\nSo, yeah its likely in development now, but I wouldn't expect much.  A teaser with the logo and some minor visuals (literally a flash of visuals) is all we are likely to get, if not this year, then certainly within the next 2 years.   Remember, Fable has been in development for years, and they've still not shown it, its not even certain it'll show up at this most recent event.\n\nExpecting gameplay or a release date of Gears 6 is rather unrealistic, at most I expect a flash of Gears 6's logo, to let everyone know its in development and coming to build hype, because Xbox has been in dire straights as of late, I was even amazed at Halo even likely getting some air time for Season 4 trailer during the event.\n\nWith how redfall, Halo and Gears 5 turned out (not to be commercial successes day one) I can see them teasing Gears 6, but its equally as unlikely.\n\n### Comment ID jmkvd55 with +1 score by [(IamMovieMiguel, Reddit, 2023-06-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/13w5llv/we_are_getting_gears_of_war_6_at_the_xbox/jmkvd55/) (in reply to ID jmgiuhm):\nThank you! Exactly this is why I was completely astounded last year when tc said \"no gears annouments anytime soon\" and everyone was like \"is coming this year\". The math just doesn't add up.

It can be treated like resident evil 4 remake with the new things they added and a overhaul on gameplay to match modern day standard.Gears of war 2 campaign is by far the best in the series and it deserves the same love like gears of War ultimate edition if not more.\n\n## Comment ID jmb1dka with +3 score by [(BarracudaFragrant631, Reddit, 2023-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/13w5llv/we_are_getting_gears_of_war_6_at_the_xbox/jmb1dka/) (in reply to ID 13w5llv):\nStop rushing out for gears 6 you bitches are the same ones complaining about rushed unfinished games y'all better fuckin wait\n\n## Comment ID jma95zk with +2 score by [(LuisCJ58, Reddit, 2023-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/13w5llv/we_are_getting_gears_of_war_6_at_the_xbox/jma95zk/) (in reply to ID 13w5llv):\n1) Gears 6 seems like a way off.

Also it was also stated by Jeff grubb that gears 6 enter development and those two new Ips were canceled so don’t know what to believe.\n\n3) Gears Collection has pick up steam with Jeff Grubb, Jez Corden, Tom Warren & Shpeshal Nick.

But in \\[this\\] moment, we had an opportunity to write our next step, and this one just felt too good to miss.”  \n\n>It’s also important to note that E-Day is not a spin-off, it’s a completely new entry to the mainline series, set earlier in the timeline. The events of the game not only serve as an exciting origin tale of two beloved characters, but it also adds detail and context to this period that will resonate through stories that will follow. In E-day, the Locust are not foes that our characters are accustomed to fighting. They are mysterious, formidable and overwhelming – an unforeseen horror that Marcus, Dom, and the rest of Sera must learn to deal with before it’s too late. Everything that happens in *E-Day* will shape the future of Gears of War for the better.  \n\n>This is the Gears of War story you’ve always wanted to hear, and it’s going to be incredible.\n\nLink to the article for anyone interested in giving it a read - [Reinventing A Mad World: Why Gears of War: E-Day Represents the Future of the Series - Xbox Wire](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-interview-details-xbox-games-showcase-2024/)\n\n### Comment ID l7uvi5c with +5 score by [(C_Noticles, Reddit, 2024-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1dc0ccn/gears_of_war_eday_announced_xbox_games_showcase/l7uvi5c/) (in reply to ID l7ukj8n):\nShitty thing is is gears 6 could be amazing, but some people are still gonna dislike it cuz it's not the same as the first 3.\n\n## Comment ID l7ulatf with +12 score by [(CDHmajora, Reddit, 2024-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1dc0ccn/gears_of_war_eday_announced_xbox_games_showcase/l7ulatf/) (in reply to ID 1dc0ccn):\nWith this and Doom Dark ages, I actually have a reason to rebuy an Xbox now :D\n\nIt’s not a Marcus Fenix collection like I wanted, but I’m not gonna lie, I think deep down I just wanted more of Marcus and Dom together again (I honestly just don’t care much for Kait and JD despite me really trying too.

So many lighthearted moments. In Gears of War it’s Marcus, Dom and Delta Squad giving each other shit to make it through dangerous times. That’s the big difference. Having been in the military for 12 years, I personally know that when you’re embracing the suck THAT is when you make true friends and brotherly bonds.\n\nNot galavanting across settlements picking off robots to steal resources like it’s nothing.\n\n#### Comment ID l7uwnkk with +6 score by [(CDHmajora, Reddit, 2024-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1dc0ccn/gears_of_war_eday_announced_xbox_games_showcase/l7uwnkk/) (in reply to ID l7utsl4):\nI think this is one of my bigger problems with gears 4 and 5. It tries too hard to be funny. JD in 4 especially was always throwing wisecracks at everything like he was trying to impress his crush. The characters never really took the stakes seriously (like every interaction they have with Jinn in 4 is them just pissing her off by being smartasses. Then doing a pikachu face when she sends an army after them.).\n\nKait in 5 (I don’t remember much about her in 4 tbh outside of JD simping for her, and her treating Marcus like shit because he’s ex-COG.) honestly feels like she’s 15 at times and still going through puberty. She has more mood swings than Elon Musk on a Twitter rant. She has bipolar interactions with every ally she has. She’s selfish and makes everything about herself. And it always felt to me that they tried to make her “special” due to her heritage, but they had nothing else to do with her that advances the story in any meaningful way outside of that heritage.\n\nAnd Del? Who cares about him? Not to be mean but he always just felt like the token black guy to me. But without any of the charm and constantly positive outlook that Cole rocks (Cole’s awesome. His presence alone can overturn morale on even the most fucked up battlefields). He was supposed to be the “Dom” for JD, but just didn’t do anything at all because the writers really wanted Kait to be JD’s partner (remember the original gears 4 reveal? Del wasn’t there. He was absolutely added later on because they realised JD and Kait have shit chemistry together.). They admittedly did try to do stuff with Del in gears 5 to make him seem like the straight man of the trio who follows his heart more than the mission, but that just feels like he’s trying to copy Dom rather than give Del any agency of his own.\n\nSorry. This went off as a rant. And I won’t say I hate gears 4 and 5. There’s some good in 4, and plenty of good parts of gears 5. But the main protagonists are absolutely terrible compared to Delta squad and I honestly don’t think gears 6 will change that :/\n\n## Comment ID l7umfac with +24 score by [(GangstaManStan, Reddit, 2024-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1dc0ccn/gears_of_war_eday_announced_xbox_games_showcase/l7umfac/) (in reply to ID 1dc0ccn):\nI loved the depressing feel of the trailer. Makes me think we’re returning to our roots of an aesthetic/atmosphere similar to Gears 1-2. I also loved how they showcased the locust drones true strength. We’ve always been told how strong they are but outside of Gears 2 we were never truly shown how physically strong they are.\n\nSide note I’ve always wanted a story following young delta squad (assuming Cole and Baird show up but I doubt it since in Gears 1 they were strangers to Marcus and Dom), but after how bad Judgement was it kind of always slipped my mind. Any theories on what the story will be about? Probably just saving a city or trying to survive?\n\nThis is truly the best case scenario to be honest. I didn’t really care for a Gears 6, although I am very curious who survived Gears 5 JD or Del and what direction TC will go with that choice, and I was super hyped for a Gears collection, but this is better than both options IMO.\n\n### Comment ID l7uoe8k with +13 score by [(momo_46, Reddit, 2024-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1dc0ccn/gears_of_war_eday_announced_xbox_games_showcase/l7uoe8k/) (in reply to ID l7umfac):\nI hope they will not rush into the E-day and show Sera at peace\n\n#### Comment ID l7ut71d with +12 score by [(Shark_Bite_OoOoAh, Reddit, 2024-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1dc0ccn/gears_of_war_eday_announced_xbox_games_showcase/l7ut71d/) (in reply to ID l7uoe8k):\nIt’d be pretty awesome to start the game with the siege of Aspho Fields where Marcus and Carlos are fighting a tank on a bridge as infantry, and Dom is with Hoffman and the SpecOps team to steal the Hammer of Dawn technology from the UIR.\n\nThere Carlos meets his fate and we see how Marcus takes the loss.

I've waited so long for an old Gears styled game. People are free to like what they like but I was really disappointed with Gears 4. I never bothered with 5 and certainly didn't care for a 6th. I have been holding out hope for a Gears collection proper remaster. That was what I thought would be the only thing to bring me back. I'm genuinely looking forwards to seeing more from this game. \n\nI hope that if the game is good and they don't intend to expand from this game, that they're working on a proper remaster. I crave so badly to play the old original three, but I can't get used to how it plays and what not any more. I'd love a more fluid feel to the game but maintaining what made the series so good in the first place. Modernise it slightly so it plays better but finding that fine line of not making it something it isn't.\n\n## Comment ID l7us065 with +3 score by [(LonesomeWater, Reddit, 2024-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1dc0ccn/gears_of_war_eday_announced_xbox_games_showcase/l7us065/) (in reply to ID 1dc0ccn):\nLETS GO!\n\n## Comment ID l7usitx with +3 score by [(Akhmatov0501, Reddit, 2024-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1dc0ccn/gears_of_war_eday_announced_xbox_games_showcase/l7usitx/) (in reply to ID 1dc0ccn):\n🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡\n\n## Comment ID l7v5fvl with +3 score by [(LostSoulNo1981, Reddit, 2024-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1dc0ccn/gears_of_war_eday_announced_xbox_games_showcase/l7v5fvl/) (in reply to ID 1dc0ccn):\nExcuse my language…\n\nFUCK YEAH!!!\n\nI’ve been waiting for an E-Day game for years!\nLet’s hope they don’t fuck it up and they actually stick to previously established lore.\n\nI’m already kind of hopeful as Marcus was using the mk.1 lancer.\n\n## Comment ID l7ump9h with +8 score by [(Doodenmier, Reddit, 2024-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1dc0ccn/gears_of_war_eday_announced_xbox_games_showcase/l7ump9h/) (in reply to ID 1dc0ccn):\nI'm **hyped** for it whenever it comes, but at the same time, this short reveal leaves me with a few concerns. Specifically, we don't have *any* details besides it being a prequel for Marcus and Dom, so I assume we're nowhere near launch yet. And I know some people are burned out by the Kait story, but it kind of signals to me that we're going to have a decade+ between Gears 5 and its sequel, especially if E-Day is considered a mainline game rather than a spinoff like Judgement\n\nI just hope horde is back and we have proper enemy diversity.

I have been itching for more Marcus as a protagonist since 2011.\n\nBut I would’ve preferred ultimately that we get Gears 6 with grizzled Marcus as its main protagonist, with this tone more or less, and advertised as the end of the new trilogy.\n\nAnd then, after that, give us Gears E-Day. Because I’m fucking here for it. I am stoked and will be playing this day one. I’m just not a fan of the waiting more than half a decade to continue stories that has been happening more and more this gen.

Last Gears game was in 2019, 7 years are way too much... Not to mention that if Gears 6 needs 5-6 years after they are done with E-Day that means the next chapter of Gears 5 story will come 13-14 years after Gears 5!

It's been mostly fixed, but these things hurt the game.\n\nThe story is... Not the best. The bland characters mean you don't really get invested. \n\nJD in Gears 4 is basically just \"the son of Marcus Pheonix\" with very little to actually like. In 5 he gets sidelined after being wreckless, but never really letting us see how it affected him. We just have him show up, scarred and sort of grown. Addressing very little of his character development. \n\nKait, is interesting... At least in terms of how people react to her. We're given a little about her throughout 4 with who she is in the grander story being more important than trying to let the player get to know her. With how the story starts some time has passed since 4 in the 5th installment. It's s implied that her connection to the Locusts/Swarm has been progressing. This is where a lot of people really get lost in weeds on liking her or not. Most dislike her because they think she's a whining crybaby. I'm not going to say they're wrong. But if most of these people were put through the wringer like she has, they'd likely act similarly. Though we're given very little to like beyond some small moments, so regardless of the \"whining\" being justified or not, there's very little to like. \n\nDel is great as a secondary character. He's the supportive friend that has some tech knowledge. In 4 he's meh, while in 5 he's actually a much stronger character throughout. He even manages to get a few chuckles out of me in some cutscenes. Along with actually trying to talk about problems with his friends. He's one of the better new characters, as controversial of an opinion as that might be to some people.\n\nFahz... Uh he's apparently kind of popular. I don't really get it. He's an A-hole who turns out to not be as much on A-hole as your initially led to believe. Which isn't terrible, but similar to Del he fills his role well enough.\n\nIt's really funny that I loved the characters in hivebusters. They were actually fun and we'll written, on top of giving us a varied but short campaign. I loved it in general over the main story and it proves the devs can make a fun but somewhat serious story. \n\nOn top of the characters the story was just so... Meh. 4 was literally just a story to justify sequels, and 5 for some reason felt the need to explain the origin of the Locusts. Which kind of did very little for the story, and offered minimal real payoff when you can predict it in the first hour or so. \n\nThen the open world. Which basically just replaced the vehicle/turret sections, and didn't add much. But was the biggest addition to the campaign. It was honestly kind of disappointing, and made things just feel slow.\n\nFinally. One of the biggest reasons Gears in general hasn't really taken off, is the multiplayer. When it's 90% people just bouncing around with shotguns, mostly getting one-shot. You're either on of the few people that likes it, or you can't get into the multiplayer pretty much at all. As satisfying as it is once you get the hang of it, it's not for everyone. \n\nWhich is why I'm surprised horde doesn't get more love. I get that escape was added too, but I feel like multiplayer PvE content is  much more palatable to the vast majority of gamers when it comes to Gears. Because the alternative is \"fixing\" PvP to be more appealing to general audiences. Which would kill the game for its fans. \n\nIt's sad to say, but as fun and exciting as the game can be. It's just not being handled correctly by Microsoft and The Coalition.\n\n### Comment ID ichayxc with +10 score by [(javycane, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/ichayxc/) (in reply to ID icgrf62):\nYour last sentence sums it up lol.\n\n### Comment ID iciqanm with +5 score by [(FelledWolf, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/iciqanm/) (in reply to ID icgrf62):\nTo tack onto this, gears horde used to be where I can load a map and have a chatoic session with no having to prepare cards and classes and gather power.. those mechanics are not fun for me.

There are third person games like fortnite that have much more verticality and run and gun style movement with zero reliance on a cover system. There’s other third person cover shooters that are slower and more tactically paced. \n\nGears has a weird spot in the middle. Grounded gameplay with extremely twitchy run and cover gameplay. Watch an absolute sweat play the game, and it looks like they’re having a stroke between walls and one-shotting everyone.\n\nThe biggest gears fans are people that have been playing the game since forever ago.

I've been playing since 2006.  \n\nGears 4/5 had an AWFUL launch where we were literally dip fed content for months.  Gears 4 was basically unplayable on PC unless you were using 2 year old graphics drivers.  The new series (imo) has a much less exciting campaign which doesn't draw in new players.  I can't convince my friends to play the series even though I'm absolutely in love with it because they have no way to play it on PC and none of us have picked up a controller in about a decade.  \n\nThey need to come out swinging with a collection of the first 3 games like MCC did.  No issues, ALL the content of those games and more.  Then they need to hype/advertise the absolutely shit out of Gears 6 (none of that bury a friend trailer bullshit, something like the Gears 3 ashes to ashes/dust to dust, or Gears 4 tomorrow trailer that make you feel actual emotion) and the game needs to actually be good enough to back up the hype.  \n\nHalo was able to make some sort of a comeback.

The cover-based shooting was relatively groundbreaking when the series launched but is nothing special now. If anything, game movement and combat feel a little outdated and clunky compared to other modern titles.\n\nCampaigns of 4 and 5 were lackluster (both in writing and gameplay) compared to previous titles - and multiplayer, both Horde and especially PvP are pretty niche.

Some objective, some subjective.\n\nFirst off I think this series has plateud in quality. IMO the biggest drop in quality is the campaign. It's bland and forgettable. We have a whiny protag who gets pulled along and makes selfish decisions. Dom breaking Marcus out of prison already kinda attaches me to this chad who broke me out. Also, there is much less care put towards the gritty gore nature of combat. Cement chunks don't come off low walls, guts don't stay on the floor, you name it. Gritty, gore, and guts was what differentiated this game from CoD. You look at a bunch of games trailers and GoW 1-3 stood out because of that. And now it's just very bland generic looking less thick people shooting at each other. Wooptido. And guess what our next quest is? Is it a hammer of dawn related mission? Is grass green? The game gets rid of epic setpiece moments like riding a brumak or a whole campaign inside a worm in favor of open world. You get a discount black guy who might as well not exist. And let's just accept the fact that they likely can't beat the original trilogy's characters or story.\n\nSecond, barely any innovation. Maybe someone will argue about this. But gears 5 looks like it went backward 2 notches. Sure the graphics are nicer, but 1 to 2 to 3 were slapping the crap out of the gaming space when it comes to innovative gameplay. First time you blew up a guy with a wall nade was fun AF. I hated the server advantage back then but boy was it fun. We also got horde mode long time ago. What new came out after? Now its just the same rehashed multiplayer with microtransacrions.\n\nThird, the decline of Xbox. Microsoft dropped the ball on the Xbox One and so there's just less people interested in Microsoft exclusives.\n\nSadly, Halo is also suffering the same problems today. Much the same problems also. Halo Infinite campaign is so bland I don't know if I can keep listening to the monkey make a speech for the 100th time. Ah guess what Halo got though! oPeN wOrLd gAmEpLaY\n\n### Comment ID icgvbi8 with +7 score by [(TierceK, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/icgvbi8/) (in reply to ID icgbg8d):\nInteresting post.\n\nDisagree about campaign, although agree about Del not being utilized enough and some more set pieces would be cool.\n\nStrongly disagree about gameplay. The chain melees, pulling someone over cover, new weapons, improved sprinting or rowdy-run, playable jack, classes, and escape all are new additions which still fit the Gears feeling. Drastic changes like taking away the cover-base system would only make this not feel like Gears anymore.\n\nStrongly agree about the decline of Xbox.

Even a fairly well-supported game like Gears 5 is naturally gonna peter off after a while\n\n* I don't want to say it's 'outdated' or anything, but... most of the gaming world has kind of moved on from the third person cover shooter. Gears is the only one left, really. It was a huge trend back then but it's just not that popular anymore. The gameplay doesn't really have the same kind of infinitely replayable appeal as something like Fortnite or Destiny.\n\n* On a related note, one could argue that the gaming mainstream is kind of 'over' Gears in general - it was hot shit in the late noughties, but the hype's fizzled out a bit as tastes and trends have evolved. Gears 4 and 5 were well received, but I don't think they were really bringing in newer crowds\n\n* Too much competition - there are tons of online multiplayer games being released and updated all the time, all fighting for your attention. Back in the Gears 1-3 days there wasn't nearly as much, online console gaming was still in its early years and was still very novel. You had a lot of copycats but Gears was up there and arguably instrumental in the dominance of the 360 at the time. It's not really the case anymore.

Maybe CoD (though Warzone seems much more popular than classic multiplayer), and maybe Halo, which is suffering pretty badly, it would be more popular if it launched with forge\n\n## Comment ID icij5vy with +1 score by [(fredujour, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/icij5vy/) (in reply to ID vcttwn):\nAmen Bro!

A big hurtle with gears games is that movement is just as important as aim. Often people may get turned off to the wall bouncing when underneath it all it’s great for mixing up opponents and is very useful for positioning. I think people who play fighting games can appreciate this aspect of the game.

I think a majority of the issue is Gears has always faced is that it’s a very niche game. Over the shoulder shooters just aren’t as popular as FPS. Not to mention the story and lore coincide with that. That mad the fan base very first hard and loyal and I think when gears 5 came out everything from dropping “of war” and making things pay to play instead of being able to grind for everything just felt like they sold out to try to appeal to groups that never cared anyways. Gameplay wise it’s pretty damn good but they no doubt alienated a lot of franchise long fans in their approach to this one unfortunately.

Then they released Judgement which was utter ass and kind of killed the franchise for a hot second. Gears 4 came, as did 5 and I agree with other posters, the core gameplay hasn’t really changed and it’s largely the same bumper jumper gnasher gameplay. Gears is a weird game where it’s kind of locked into its gameplay. Everything is very locked in and constrained. You need to use cover, you need a gnasher, and there’s no way of changing without killing the franchise. I’m not a fan of spin-offs, but they just did one with Gears Tactics which was cool. They need some more content since Gears is beloved by a lot of the Xbox community. In Gears 6 I wish there was more weapons, more customization, more classes, better rank up system, more factions, better movement that’s more fluid, different story, etc. They better not make a Battle Royale because that would be a Longshot fuckfest from across the entire map.\n\n#### Comment ID geyewl6 with +2 score by [(AragornsMassiveCock, Reddit, 2020-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/k8giew/gears_franchise_is_underrated/geyewl6/) (in reply to ID gey7j35):\n*More* classes?

The campaign's are great but they shoehorn microtransactions and silly season pass cosmetics in. Like, why rebrand it as 'Gears' instead of Gears of War? It's silly things like that which just make no sense. I don't even think *they* know what they want from that game anymore. \n\nThe movie crossovers and wrestling characters jammed in are also mega-cringey. They spend the better part of a decade building a franchise that has an immersive universe, fantastic maps which create atmosphere, only to dilute it with Terminator and Batista. \n\nHalf the good game modes are gone, Wingman has been requested for over a year now and it's not been added. Their rationale is it was barely played, but then they have a 2 v 2 gnashed gamemode? Right. \n\nSays it all when Rod Ferguson left.\n\n### Comment ID gexz6ks with +2 score by [(Exorcist-138, Reddit, 2020-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/k8giew/gears_franchise_is_underrated/gexz6ks/) (in reply to ID gexyafi):\nIt’s not longer gears of war because they are no longer at war.

You could give him a redemption story but that's a bit generic and it's more interesting to me if he doesn't get that redemption, he fucked up trying to live up to the family name and if he stays dead then that's just the price to pay for making the mistakes he did.

Men like Marcus and Dom are the men on the ground who suffer from the stress and strain of the machine that is war (it's why they're called 'COGs' and 'Gears'). Marcus is a man who must go through hardship, he is moulded by, shaped by it, and as hard as he tried in Gears 4 he can't escape it; but his character is one who emerges from it. \n\nIn Gears 1 he returns from prison and climbs to the rank of sergeant and leadership, earning his place and respect from others. In 2 he must overcome the loss of his friend (Tai), and his charge (Ben Carmine), and watch his best friend finally reunite with their wife only to euthanise her, before sacrificing the last bastion of ordered civilisation they've known (Jacinto) to stop the Locust...only for it to fail. In 3 he loses his best friend, and later a father he had thought long dead, and then in 4 we learn Anya died and the locust have returned. By JD dying in 5, it fits with the theme of suffering that Marcus constantly endures but no matter the suffering he endures and rises - there's a reason his last name is \"Fenix\" after all. The interesting thing going forward will be is this the thing that finally breaks him, or will he rise again to carry on? \n\nAlso killing JD allows for John Dimaggio an amazing performance, I was dreading the scene leading up to it and was dam near tears; a great blend of subtly and weight behind it.\n\n## Comment ID j98vq10 with +18 score by [(PovasTheOne, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j98vq10/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nI’d like for this stupidity to be retcon and for both characters to be alive in the next game.

Gears has never been a Mass Effect like series with decisions to make like this. So now they either have to make two different campaigns based on what decision was made, or render it all pointless by making one of the deaths cannon. Personally, I think JD surviving should be the cannon choice. His rise, fall, and rise again is a much more interesting story, and they can't keep letting Marcus lose his people.

He clearly has more arc to be told. We are shown he has flaws and recklessness that , while “worked out” with the launching the missile on azura- it did not with the convey/Lizzie. Marcus is very critical of him and he’s struggling to live in Marcus and Anya footsteps . His recklessness affected Baird by forcing his hand with the hammer of dawn - a wound that’s still open. He lied about his involvement with settlement 2. \n\nDel was his best friend - his death hits him hard and becomes the catalyst to getting him back on “the good path” while also bringing JD and Marcus closer together.\n\nDels death cutscenes felt more authentic too. First we get a Marcus and JD heart to heart .  Something JD has wanted since gears 4. Kaits way of saying “he was my friend too” resonated well given their bond from mount katar. We also get a moment of remorse from Fauz when he realized del is gone.\n\nDels story was told- he’s the charismatic best friend - he was there for Kait when she needed someone . He inadvertently brought the whole squad together to mourn his death. \n\nI think either JD surviving is canon or Gears has two campaigns to account for both scenarios (really hope they don’t do this)\n\n5% of me also thinks they keep del alive as canon cause “shock factor” which would be stupid too\n\n## Comment ID j99le0j with +3 score by [(Evergladeleaf, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j99le0j/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nI’m gonna say it, I didn’t like James as a character, though del was a more fun companion and more interesting character\n\nIn a perfect world it’s revealed that no one actually died, but I chose James to die on every playthrough\n\n### Comment ID j9czlas with +3 score by [(VionValor, Reddit, 2023-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j9czlas/) (in reply to ID j99le0j):\nJames was such a dick in this game too lol\n\n## Comment ID j99ah9b with +7 score by [(BreakBlue, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j99ah9b/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nHopefully Kait anyway.\n\n## Comment ID j98zuft with +7 score by [(Krakatorn, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j98zuft/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nThey could pull a Wolfenstein and have branching storylines.\n\n### Comment ID j99456k with +10 score by [(xxWolfMan1313xx, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j99456k/) (in reply to ID j98zuft):\nThis, this is what I would like kinda.

Well midway through you come to a point where he removes his helmet revealing it to be either JD or Del in a Swarm like form.\n\nNow if it’s JD the game plays out more brutal. The Swarm are more bloodthirsty and savage. If it’s Del then they are more technologically savvy and really outsmart the player.\n\nAt the point of the reveal if JD, Marcus is stunned to know his son is somewhat alive.

It's her \"Dom's sacrifice\" moment, where she has to process the loss of her friend, swallow her grief, and fight on. Gears 5 is all about Kait's journey as a character and learning how to keep fighting after heartbreak is the last step she takes in the game.\n\n## Comment ID j9a8s8c with +3 score by [(ec2033, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j9a8s8c/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nneither, retcon that garbage, if you wanna kill a character off just do it, dont force the players to decide.\n\n## Comment ID j9bh66c with +3 score by [(george_reeves_, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j9bh66c/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nI picked JD to live, I couldn’t do that to Marcus\n\n## Comment ID kiqlhjp with +3 score by [(Spartan_leo_213, Reddit, 2024-01-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/kiqlhjp/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nYou would think if Reyna or Myyrah knew who jd was she would kill him right away because for revenge for Marcus killing her in the end of gears 3\n\n### Comment ID kj2w5wg with +1 score by [(Every_Traffic_8973, Reddit, 2024-01-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/kj2w5wg/) (in reply to ID kiqlhjp):\nYour comment it late but thanks for answering\n\n#### Comment ID kjdd5ge with +1 score by [(Spartan_leo_213, Reddit, 2024-01-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/kjdd5ge/) (in reply to ID kj2w5wg):\nEh yeah dude\n\n## Comment ID j995ejc with +4 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j995ejc/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nI hope it’s Del, his character is kind of shallow.

However, I believe he's the one who dies in the canon ending, unless they Mass Effect it and have two different campaigns based upon player choice. I also read online that Del dying might be the canon one, but the only proof they have was the way the official guide went and used JD for everything after the choice, so take that with a grain of salt.\n\n## Comment ID j9aocnx with +1 score by [(Legomaniac316, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j9aocnx/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nI noticed that between the 2 different endings, besides Marcus' reaction, It felt like more attention was put into Dels, and what was made in that was reused for JD's.\n\nTruthfully i hope neither is canon, however they could pull a Wolfenstein on us.\n\n## Comment ID j9b2uzl with +1 score by [(Rustyvw1, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j9b2uzl/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nHopefully it takes a page from the telltale games book and makes a different path for each option in the next game with different dialogue options.\n\n## Comment ID j9b5dw0 with +1 score by [(PawLawz, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j9b5dw0/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nI’m guessing the game will just do a recap where the player is asked if they remember who died, with both options changing the story a little bit.\n\n## Comment ID j9b9lrc with +1 score by [(chinasorrows2705, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j9b9lrc/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nI choose JD because he was an asshole up to that point\n\n## Comment ID j9c7irh with +1 score by [(MaximumPotatoee, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j9c7irh/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nAyy I haven't kept of with the recent GoW story, but did they really bring back that bitch queen Mira for the new game?

From a narrative stand-point, it makes more sense. \n\nDel is in the game far more than JD. Del's relationship with everyone makes it more impactful. He's Kait's best friend, especially during the temporary break-up with JD. He's Baird's protégé. He's a second son to Marcus. He's JD's brother. He's JACK's controller, which makes JACK's sacrifice way more emotional if he did it to avenge Del. \n\nPlus, Del's death is what completes Marcus and JD's arc. Marcus was unable to properly grieve Anya with JD and instead sent him to a boarding school. JD is now able to be vulnerable and ask for his father's love, and Marcus is now able to be there for his son when he loses his brother. It repairs their relationship. \n\nJD's death accomplishes nothing narrative-wise and leaves Marcus and JD's arcs unresolved. It's also a very much unneeded emotional toll on Marcus. He lost his parents, his brothers, his friends, his wife, and NOW his only son? No. He doesn't need that much suffering.\n\n## Comment ID j9d1v1w with +1 score by [(Redhood_Ranger, Reddit, 2023-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j9d1v1w/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nListen I like both characters but Marcus went through enough, JD being the canon death would be Marcus’ 13th reason why\n\n## Comment ID j9d4k7p with +1 score by [(BigPapaTubes, Reddit, 2023-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j9d4k7p/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nI would like if there was a third tentacle for kait, and the only option was that all three die.

He had a lot of development in 4 too, but 5 felt personal to our relationship with the character. JD did a lot of behind the scenes character development which hasn't paid off yet.

Marcus fought in the original war and knew it took sacrifice and hard decision making to win and guarantee a chance for humanity, yet his son decides to stop a violent protest and that’s where he draws the Line."

      "# [Gears of War 6 Needs to Go Back to What Made the Franchise Great in the First Place Apparently](https://www.imdb.com/news/ni64567494/)\nGears of War is one of the most notable Xbox franchises in recent history and fans are excited for the next installment. The series has gone through quite some changes and it has deviated from its roots and the community has found a solution to make the sequel feel more familiar.\n\nThe gaming community misses the dark and gritty feel of the first few games in the franchise and hopes to see the same atmosphere return in the latest entry. Perhaps the key to the success of the video game series is pure nostalgia.\n\nGears of War 6 Should Take a Trip Down Memory Lane\n\nGears of War 6 is currently in active development over at The Coalition Studio.\n\nSequels can either elevate the franchise or take a wrong turn and lead it to an irredeemable ditch of disappointment. The Coalition Studio is doing its absolute best to bring an authentic gaming experience.",

      "# [Augustus Cole by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2007-10-30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_Cole)\nFictional character in the Gears of War video game series\n\nFictional character\n\nAugustus ColeGears of War characterFirst appearanceGears of War (2006)Designed byCliff BleszinskiVoiced byLester Speight\n\nAugustus \"Cole Train\" Cole is a fictional character in the Gears of War media franchise. He first appeared in the first video game of the series as a supporting character, and has since appeared in some capacity for every mainline and spin-off installment of the Gears of War franchise. Cole is voiced by Lester Speight in all of his video game appearances.\n\nWithin the series, Cole is a former star athlete in his youth who participated in humanity's war with the Locust Horde on the planet Sera by enlisting with the Coalition of Ordered Governments (\"COG\"), a supranational and intergovernmental military collective who are the dominant human political force on Sera. Cole has spent most of his military career alongside his close friend, Damon Baird; unlike Baird and most of Cole's team mates, who are often dour or cynical in temperament, he is usually depicted as a vibrant, enthusiastic character known for his brash humor and infectious energy.\n\nAs one of the most well known characters in the Gears of War series, Augustus Cole has earned a mostly positive reception, but also criticism and accusations of racism by some sources. The character was the subject of legal action launched by Lenwood Hamilton, a former National Football League player who claimed that his publicity rights was infringed upon because the video game character had a number of features he alleged were identified with him or his public persona. Various merchandise for the character, as with other of the series' characters, has been released.\n\nCreation and development\n\n[edit]\n\nCole is named after Phil Cole, a level designer at Epic Games.[1] Cole is concepted as an ex-professional player of Thrashball, a contact sport heavily inspired by American football, prior to the events of the video game series.[2] Cole and Baird's roles were originally reversed, with David Beckham as the inspiration for Baird as a sports star.[1] Former The Coalition studio head Rod Fergusson revealed in an interview that Cole was originally going to be named \"Gus the Bus\", but the developers were concerned that they would infringe on the nickname of a Pittsburgh Steelers football player who matched the Bus reference; as a result, the studio went with the name \"Cole Train\" instead.[3] Fergusson noted that players would be able to pick up references about \"Gus\" if they have played the original game, as the voice actor of series protagonist Marcus Fenix John DiMaggio was instructed to say the \"Gus\" line with Cole, but the studio did not do much more from a dialogue perspective.[3] The development team later used Jamie Foxx's character from the sports drama movie Any Given Sunday as Cole's archetype.[1]\n\nFor Gears of War 3, Cole was originally meant to play a more prominent role; players were supposed to be able to swap between Fenix and Cole throughout the progression of the single player campaign.[4] Cole has a daughter named Hana who first appears in the Hivebusters comic series to support the eponymous squad in their endeavours. The developers originally intended for Hana to appear in the main campaign of Gears 5, but due to story changes during the game's development, her character no longer fit into its narrative; instead, she is redesigned as a scientist who develops a method for infiltrating and destroying enemy Swarm Hives from within in the spin-off Hivebusters comic, which takes place in parallel with the events of Gear 5.[5]\n\nCole is Lester Speight's first role in the video game industry.[6] Speight said the character's popularity led to many fans identifying him as Cole, and they would regularly express their excitement towards him and his work via social media sites, websites and in person.[6] Dan Ryckert from Gameinformer have noted the real-life resemblance of Speight, a former footballer, to his character, commenting that \"casting choices don't get much easier than this\".[7]\n\nAppearances\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Gears of War, Cole and Baird are first encountered by Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago as the surviving members of Alpha Squad. Cole joined Delta Squad after the rest of Alpha Squad is confirmed to be killed in action, and he would remain with Delta Squad throughout the original Gears of War trilogy. He is well known as a sports celebrity in Sera for his career as a Thrashball player prior to \"Emergence Day\", when the Locust Horde first emerged from their subterranean lairs to wage a genocidal war of attrition against humanity 14 years before the events of the first and eponymous video game of the series. In the Gears of War 3 single player campaign, Cole is a playable character from Act One, Chapter 3 until the beginning of Act Two, where he leads a small force to search for supplies in his hometown of Hanover. In Gears of War: Judgement, a prequel set a few months after Emergence Day, Cole appears as one of the game's playable protagonists and a member of Kilo Squad along with squad leader Baird, Onyx Guard cadet Sofia Hendrick and former UIR soldier Garron Paduk.[8]\n\nBy the events of Gears of War 4, which is set more than two decades after the conclusion of the war with the Locust Horde, Cole is regarded by the public as a respected war veteran. He appears in the opening sequence of the game with Victor Hoffman and Samantha Byrne during a speech by COG First Minister Jinn. He appears in the last act to aid Marcus and his son J.D., along with their associates Kait Diaz and Delmont \"Del\" Walker. He also appears in Gears 5 as part of the war effort against the Swarm, the successor to the original Locust Horde. Cole has remained at the rank of private throughout his entire military career as he has rejected every military promotion that has been offered, under the grounds that having rank is not going to affect how many enemies he can kill.\n\nDoctor Hana Cole appears as a supporting character in the Gears 5 downloadable content expansion pack, Hivebusters. Hana tells Team Scorpio that her father was the one who connected her with Colonel Victor Hoffman for the Hivebuster operation and that Cole's introspection on the military and the war had kept her away from the military industrial complex of the COG administration, which is what Cole had wanted. Unlike her father, she takes after her unnamed mother with regards to her lack of interest in sports.\n\nCole is available as a playable character in the franchise's spin-off titles: Gears Pop! and in Gears Tactics as a pre-order exclusive.\n\nPromotion and reception\n\n[edit]\n\nLike other characters in the Gears of War franchise, Augustus Cole has been subject to various merchandise. In 2011, Epic Games released a \"Cole Train Thrashball statue\" depicting Cole wearing a Thrashball-themed sports uniform. It is made out of pure resin and weighs 6.4 pounds.[9]\n\nCole has received a mostly positive critical reception, and is noted as a fan-favorite character.[10][11] In August 2007, North American game-related cable TV channel G4 awarded Speight \"Best Voiceover\" for his performance as Augustus Cole.[12] Staff of the gaming section of the Australian publication The Age ranked Cole #12 on their list of Top 50 Xbox characters of all time in 2008, praising the character for injecting a much-needed dose of comedy and personality into the series.[13] In 2011, Cole placed #46 on a reader's poll organized by Guinness Book of Records for the top 50 video game characters of all time.[14] In an article published by Red Bull, Pete Dreyer included Cole in his list of 10 video game sidekicks who deserve their own games.[11]\n\nThe character has received some negative reception, with most of the criticism accusing the character of serving as a negative racial stereotype.[15] Marc Nix from IGN argued in favor of this point, contrasting Cole's stereotypical speech patterns to Captain Anderson of the Mass Effect series or Dr. Eli Vance of the Half-Life series; Nix noted that both characters have African American heritage, though neither speak in dialog written specifically for a black character, and are simply presented as video game characters that happen to be black. Bitmob criticized Epic Games for designing Cole as a culturally insensitive character who perpetuates outdated ideas of African-Americans, and drew an unfavorable comparison to Dominic Santiago, who is a coded as a Latino character and is depicted as \"cool and level-headed\" by comparison.[16] Allistair Pinsof from Destructoid criticized the story segment in the single player campaign of Gears of War 3 where the player assumes control of Cole.[17] Pinsof opined that Cole's sudden flashback is abrupt and ends with no real meaningful ties to the main Gears narrative, noting that what little backstory it provides for Cole is shallow at best, and that the character's behavior puts everyone including himself in serious danger.[17]\n\nA rap song performed in-character by Speight for the game's end credit has been positively received.[13] Tamoor Hussain from GameSpot praised a new version of the track which was featured in a trailer promoting the release of Gears of War Ultimate Edition in 2016. Hussain compared it to the song Dead Presidents II by JayZ.[18]\n\nLegal issues\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2017, former American football player Lenwood Hamilton sued Epic Games, Microsoft, and Speight, alleging that the character of Augustus Cole is taken from his own likeness and voice without his consent.[19] Hamilton claimed that Speight had approached him around 1998 about a video game, though Hamilton had turned it down due to the violence that would be in the game.[20][21] The lawsuit contended that elements of Cole's character, including his ethnic background, Cole Train nickname, renown for playing professional sports, and clothing were all elements representative of Hamilton, and alleged that voice analysis shows that Speight's delivery of Cole's lines matches closely with Hamilton's speech patterns. Lenwood was ultimately unsuccessful in his bid: according to a Pennsylvania federal court, a motion by Microsoft, Lester Speight and the other defendants for summary judgment on First Amendment grounds was granted, and that the defendants' First Amendment right to free expression in creating the Augustus Cole character that allegedly resembled plaintiff outweighed plaintiff's right of publicity.\"[22][23]",

      "# [Gears of War: E-Day Announced – Trailer Breakdown & Speculation by Angus Warrender on 2024-06-12](https://silentpcreview.com/news/gears-of-war-e-day-release-date-plot/)\nIt has been nearly five years since a mainstream entry into the Gears of War franchise, but the acclaimed series has returned with a bang. Though a Gears of War: E-Day release date is to be confirmed, the Xbox Showcase 2024 trailer has given us plenty to go on, and tells us a surprising amount of what we can expect from the latest entry into this classic series.\n\nWe’ve broken down everything we know about Gears of War: E-Day, from plot details to potential release dates – you won’t even need to play the game after we’ve explained what we know about this upcoming return to formula from the Gears franchise.\n\nThere’s little to go on when it comes to a Gears of War: E-Day release date, and The Coalition (E-Day‘s developers) have shied away from even providing a ballpark release window. Given that it’s a cinematic trailer revealed at Xbox Showcase rather than gameplay, we imagine it will be some time before we can get our hands on this new game.\n\nWe’re predicting a Q1 2025 release at the earliest for E-Day, as we don’t expect the game to be ready by Christmas 2024, but it will likely avoid the traditional Summer Gaming Drought. Initial reports seem to indicate that the game will be on Xbox Game Pass immediately upon release, which will likely boost players but hinder sales.\n\nGears of War: E-Day Trailer Breakdown\n\nIn just over two minutes, the E-Day trailer does a phenomenal job of building hype for the new Gears game. Here’s everything we noticed.\n\nFamiliar Faces\n\nThe big draw of this trailer is the return of franchise leads Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago, our favorite COG commandos. After Marcus defeats a Locust soldier in a one-on-one, the ground gives way. Marcus is set to meet an early grave in The Hollow, before being rescued by Dom – you can practically hear the fans cheering in the trailer.\n\nImmediately, this draws attention to the fact that E-Day is a prequel, set 14 years before the mainline Gears of War games. A prequel does make it harder to heighten the stakes, however: we know that Marcus and Dom survive (for now, at least). If E-Day‘s story wants to pack the necessary punch, we’ve got to care about the setting and characters around our two leads.\n\nWorn-Out Places\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the franchise, “E-Day” refers to “Emergence Day”: the day that the Locusts invaded Sera. We’ve seen flashes of it in games past, with a flashback in Gears of War 2 showing the calm-before-the-storm moment with Dom and his wife, Maria. It’s also been fleshed out in a number of tie-in novels and comics by authors such as Karen Traviss – but the events of E-Day itself are largely explained to the player second-hand. It’s a day mentioned extensively in the Gears lore, one that has real weight and gravitas: as the saying on Sera goes, “the lucky ones died on E-Day”.\n\nWith this, E-Day sets itself up to be the Halo: Reach of the Gears of War franchise: a prequel that expands on a key date in the lore, setting up the franchise leads for the story to come. How E-Day builds on the established lore whilst also ensuring the game stands on its own remains to be seen, but all signs point to a return-to-form for the game series.\n\nGoing Nowhere\n\nThere’s a few clues we picked up in the trailer visuals that could indicate some plot details. The TV in the room – thrown at a Locust Drone’s head shortly after – indicates that the games takes place in the Kalona District, a residential area in the Tyrus region. Whether the Kalona District is a section of Tyrus’ capital, Ephyra, or a separate location is not yet known – but Tyrus is Marcus and Dom’s homeland. The apartment also has a COG-themed “Welcome Home” banner on the wall. Given that E-Day takes place mere weeks after the end of the Pendulum Wars (an 80-year war in Gears history), maybe this is Marcus or Dom’s very own home we see destroyed, just as they return to it?\n\nIt’s also worth noting that whilst the trailer is a cinematic, it is captured in-engine. E-Day is using Unreal Engine 5 for it’s rendering, and the details it enables are astounding. Xbox Wire interviewed Kate Rayner, The Coalition’s Studio Technical Director, on the capabilities of Unreal 5:\n\n“We have fully modernized Gears from the ground up, infusing the DNA of Gears with the full capabilities of modern gaming technology. Every character, environment, and animation in ‘Gears of War: E-Day‘ has been completely rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5, allowing us to portray the Gears universe with unprecedented detail and fidelity.”\n\nKate Rayner, Danielle Partis – Xbox Wire\n\nGiven that the original Gears of War trailer set the precedent for in-engine trailers, it’s great to see E-Day following in its footsteps – in more ways than one…\n\nMad World\n\nThe E-Day trailer is steeped in Gears nostalgia. Aside from Marcus and Dom, we also see the return of the Lancer and its trademark blades, Locust Drones, and you can even spot a Locust Corpser cresting a distant building in the final few frames of the trailer. But what set off our nostalgia senses the most was the music. The original trailer for Gears of War, widely considered one of the best trailers in videogame history, used Gary Jules’ cover of Mad World by Tears for Fears – and you can hear subtle notes of that same track in the E-Day trailer score. The message is clear: Gears of War is back.\n\nWill Gears of War: E-Day be on PC?\n\nAlongside launching on Xbox Game Pass, Gears of War: E-Day will also have a PC release, with a dedicated Steam listing already active. You’ll still need an Xbox Live subscription to access it on PC, however. What’s more, E-Day is likely not coming to the PS5 at all, as previous Gears games have been Xbox/PC exclusives.\n\nIn Summary\n\nThough a Gears of War: E-Day release date is yet to be confirmed, Xbox has come out guns blazing with a trailer sure to give you goosebumps. We’ll be following all the latest on E-Day, keeping you updated with news, gameplay and other information. This new Gears game has quickly shot up our list of most-anticipated releases, and we can’t wait to see more!",

      "# [Helldivers 2 isn't on Game Pass, but these great alternatives are by Tomas Franzese on 2024-02-21](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/xbox-game-pass-games-like-helldivers-2/)\nHelldivers 2 is a PlayStation console exclusive, so it’s not available on Xbox Series X or S. Not only has Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer voiced his disappointment in this, but so have many Helldivers 2 players, who are asking for more backup in the fight against the Terminids and Automatons.\n\nIf you don’t own a PS5 or a good enough gaming PC to run Helldivers 2, you might be feeling a bit left out. But if you’re in the mood for a sci-fi or co-op game, there are plenty of entertaining alternate options available on Xbox Game Pass. While Xbox players can’t yet die for Super Earth, they can still have a great time fighting and dying in any of these Xbox Game Pass games that are playable on console.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nDeep Rock Galactic\n\nIf you specifically want another sci-fi co-op game, there are a couple of different options for you on Xbox Game Pass. First, we have Deep Rock Galactic, a co-op shooter about space dwarves who mine resources. In it, you go on missions to caves, gather resources and complete objectives, and then fight to extract with all your gathered resources. While it’s a bit different from Helldivers 2 with its first-person perspective and emphasis on mining, its core gameplay loop actually isn’t too far off from that game. It can offer you plenty of nail-biting emergent moments that you and your friends will be talking about weeks after the fact, which is a hallmark of a fantastic co-op game.\n\nGears 5\n\nHelldivers 2 finally gives PlayStation a console-exclusive answer to Xbox’s Gears of War, its flagship co-op third-person shooter franchise. Obviously, that also means that playing Gears 5 is a good Xbox Game Pass alternative. If you’re missing the single-player or narrative element from Helldivers 2, Gears 5 features a full campaign that will definitely scratch that itch. And if some co-op action is all you want, The Coalition’s game has a cooperative horde mode, as well as Escape, a mission-based mode more similar to the experience that Helldivers 2 provides. If Sony plans to never bring Helldivers 2 to Xbox, then it’s smart for Xbox players to show Microsoft we want more of the closest first-party franchise to Helldivers that it can offer.\n\nRemnant II\n\nA sleeper hit from 2023, Remnant II is the co-op shooter to play if you enjoy the brutally difficult nature of Helldivers 2. It’s a looter shooter that finds a way to incorporate Soulslike elements into its gunplay. Like Helldivers 2 on harder difficulties, Remnant II can be crushingly difficult sometimes, but that makes success all the more satisfying. Its roguelike setup and procedural generation systems also mean each person’s campaign is different, adding to Remnant II’s replay factor and enabling some really memorable moments in co-op. Remnant II also features the best boss fights I’ve encountered in a co-op game.\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Darktide\n\nIf mowing through hordes of enemies is the action from Helldivers 2 that you feel like you’re missing on Xbox, then I’d recommend Warhammer 40,000: Darktide. This four-player co-op, first-person shooter is brutally satisfying to play and emphasizes melee a lot more than the other games on this list. Like Helldivers 2, it understands that there’s simple fun to be had in sci-fi shooter power fantasy, but also isn’t afraid to make things a lot more difficult to force a crushing defeat or exhilarating win.\n\nBack 4 Blood\n\nBack 4 Blood’s zombie premise and mission-based setup are very different from what Helldivers 2 offers, but this is a personal co-op favorite of mine. It is made by Turtle Rock, the same studio behind the Left 4 Dead games, and features some of the best cooperative mission and level design I’ve seen in this wave of AAA shooters. Back 4 Blood’s card system also can drastically alter the difficulty and tools at players’ disposal from run to run, making for a cooperative experience that can be just as unpredictable as Helldivers 2’s missions. Back 4 Blood is a couple of years old and content complete now, so you don’t have to worry about a tail of live service support or overcrowded servers anymore.\n\nExoprimal",

      "# [Full list of upcoming Xbox first-party games: The full Microsoft Xbox Series X|S, One, and Windows PC gaming roadmap by Alexander Cope on 2024-01-13](https://www.windowscentral.com/everything-xbox-game-studios-working)\nWith each passing year, Microsoft continues to expand its gigantic library of Xbox games across multiple platforms. These include developing more games that take full advantage of the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, increasing its focus on PC gaming, and allowing players to stream their favorite Xbox games on mobile devices and cloud-gaming consoles via Xbox Game Pass.\n\nTo help increase the Xbox’s catalog, Microsoft has acquired legendary developers of the industry including the likes of Activision Blizzard, Obsidian Entertainment, inXile, Undead Labs, iD Software, Bethesda Softworks, Tango Gameworks, Arkane Studios, Machine Games, and more.\n\nWith tons of first-party studios at its disposal, Microsoft has a ton of upcoming Xbox games in the works scheduled to release in 2024 and beyond.

Since then 343 Industries has been working on updates for the game’s multiplayer and have reportedly begun development for the next installment of the Halo franchise according to the game’s art director on Linkedln.\n\nHalo Infinite was praised for its well-done single-player campaign but its live-service multiplayer mode was criticized heavily when it first launched in 2021 for lacking content, overpriced cosmetic DLC skins, and obstructive bugs. However, 343 Industries has managed to fix all these issues over the years by implementing tons of bug fixes, adding new maps and playlists, bringing in fan-favorite modes like The Forge and Firefight, and many more features to help Halo Infinite reach the best state it’s ever been in.\n\nCompulsion Games\n\nCompulsion is the game studio for creating the film-noir adventure game Contrast and the cult-classic first-person dystopian thriller, We Happy Few. During the 2023 Xbox Games Showcase, Compulsion announced their next major project, South of Midnight, which is scheduled to release on Xbox Series X|S and PC at an unspecified release date.\n\nSouth of Midnight is an adventure game where you play as Hazel, a young woman traveling the Deep South learning how to become a Weaver and wield mystical powers to banish a supernatural force haunting her town.\n\nDouble Fine\n\nDouble Fine Productions is well known for creating off-the-world and cartoony Xbox games that cater to both kids and adults such as Brutal Legend, Grim Fandango, Psychonauts, and more.

Their last major release was Wasteland 3 in 2021, a critically-acclaimed cRPG where players form a squad of Desert Rangers and roam a post-apocalyptic wasteland to find a way to keep the decaying state of Arizona alive.\n\nAt the 2023 Xbox Games Showcase, inXile revealed that their next video game would be an original IP called Clockwork Revolution. This title will be a first-person shooter where players travel through time to explore the origins of a steampunk metropolis called Avalon while altering past events to change the future.\n\nMojang\n\nMojang Studios is a Microsoft-backed studio responsible for developing and updating one of the biggest video games on the planet, Minecraft.

In the meantime, Mojang is preparing a massive 1.21 update to Minecraft, which will feature automatic crafting, new trial dungeons, new monsters to fight, and more.\n\nNinja Theory\n\nNinja Theory is a development studio known for creating action games like Heavenly Sword, Enslaved: Journey to the West, and DmC: Devil May Cry. Their most famous work is Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, a critically acclaimed action game released in 2017 that tells the heartbreaking tale of Sensua and her journey into hell to rescue the soul of her dead lover.\n\nIn 2019, Ninja Theory announced a sequel to Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice titled Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 which will be released for Xbox Series X|S and Windows PC on May 21, 2024. After her harrowing adventure in the previous game, Sensa returns for the sequel to embark on another quest. This time, she aims to travel to the haunting realm of Viking Iceland and battle forces of darkness from within and without to save souls suffering at the hands of tyrannical oppression.\n\nIn addition to Hellblade 2, Ninja Theory is currently working on a psychological horror game currently codenamed \"Project: Mara.\"\n\nObsidian\n\nObsidian Entertainment is a studio that produces a wide variety of games that have gone on to become some of the more unique titles in the Xbox library. These acclaimed titles include Grounded, Fallout: New Vegas, The Outer Worlds, the Pillars of Eternity series, South Park: The Stick of Truth, Pentiment, and more.\n\nObsidian is currently working on a sequel to The Outer Worlds, which will feature a new star system to explore and recruit new characters to their crew.\n\nIn addition, they are also working on Avowed, a fantasy RPG set in the same universe as Pillars of Eternity where players embark on a mission to save The Living Lands from a deadly plague.\n\nPlayground Games\n\nPlayground Games is a British-based studio responsible for developing the world-famous racing game series, Forza Horizon.

These games were considered cult classics for the original Xbox and Xbox 360 for their witty humor, fun combat, and moral choices that changed the direction of each game’s story. During the 2020 Xbox Games Showcase, Playground Games announced they would be rebooting the Fable series and would be incorporating the Forza series’ ForzaTech Engine to develop the game.\n\nHowever, no release date for Playground Games’ Fable reboot has been announced as of yet.\n\nRare\n\nRare is a legendary games developer that has helped to create some of the most beloved franchises for both Nintendo and Microsoft.

Not much is currently known about Everwild except that it will be an action-adventure game with elements of “god games”, a videogames genre that involves the player creating life as if they were a god.\n\nThe Coalition\n\nThe Coalition is a group of developers that helped create the Gears of War franchise for Epic Games before being bought out by Microsoft in 2014 along with the Gears of War IP. The developer’s last major entries in the Gears series were Gears 5 and a tactical spin-off called Gears Tactics. Both titles were released in 2020 but we haven’t heard of any new confirmed projects from The Coalition since then.\n\nOur most recent information suggests that The Coalition is working on two separate projects, one of which is undoubtedly Gears 6. The studio also built an advanced demo for Unreal Engine 5, based on The Matrix.\n\nThe Initiative\n\nThe Initiative is a relatively young studio created by Microsoft in 2018 and is currently led by Darrel Gallagher, who once served as the head of Crystal Dynamics and worked on the Tomb Raider series. The Initiative is currently together with Crystal Dynamics to create a reboot of Perfect Dark, an FPS series originally created by Rare.\n\nThe only known details about the Perfect Dark reboot are that it will be set in a dark future where the world is suffering from an ecological crisis and that it will be made in the Unreal 5 Engine.\n\nTurn 10\n\nTurn 10 Studios is the leading developer for Microsoft’s Forza franchise, primarily known for creating the Forza Motorsport series and the ForzaTech Engine.

Their last major release was State of Decay 2, which had a mixed reception when it first launched due to a myriad of gameplay and performances but is now much better state thanks to months of post-game updates and bug fixes.\n\nRight now, Undead Labs is working on releasing the much anticipated State of Decay 3, which was revealed during 2020’s Xbox Games Showcase. All we know about the State of Decay 3 thus far from its reveal trailer is that the game will have a bigger focus on visuals and character development.\n\nWorld's Edge\n\nWorld’s Edge is another developer studio created by Microsoft and its modus operandi is creating games for Age of Empires, one of the oldest and most beloved real-time strategy franchises that helped define the genre. World’s Edge’s last major releases were the long-awaited Age of Empire IV and the Xbox port of Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, both of which were released in 2023.\n\nThe next big project on World’s Edge’s agenda is creating a remaster of Age of Mythology called Age of Mythology: Retold (though no word has been given yet if it will come to Xbox consoles) and a mobile game spin-off called Age of Empires Mobile.\n\nBethesda Softworks\n\nOne of the biggest developers under Microsoft’s umbrella is Bethesda.

In addition, Bethesda is developing the sixth major entry for the Elder Scrolls franchise but no release date has been announced as of yet.\n\nid Software\n\nId Software is a legendary developer known for creating games that revolutionized the first-person shooter genre like Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM, and Quake. Their last major release was DOOM: Eternal released in 2020, a sequel to DOOM (2016) that had players take up the mantle of the Doom Slayer and charge headfirst into the armies of hell to rip and tear them apart.\n\nId Software hasn’t announced a new project since releasing DOOM: Eternal’s final DLC “Ancient Gods – Part Two” in 2021. According to a report from Gamerant, rumors are spreading that id Software is recruiting people to help develop a reboot of the Quake franchise.\n\nArkane Studios\n\nArkane Studios is known mainly for creating intense, singe-player action-adventure games like Dishonored, Prey, and its most recent title, DEATHLOOP. During the 2023 Game Awards event, Arkane revealed that their next big project would be Marvel's Blade.\n\nAll we know about Marvel’s Blade is that it will be set in Paris and that it will follow the adventures of Eric Brooks, a.k.a. Blade. Blade is a half-human/vampire hybrid dedicated to hunting vampires and other supernatural monsters of the Marvel universe.\n\nTango Gameworks\n\nTango Gameworks is a studio that was once known for primarily creating horror-themed titles The Evil Within and Ghostwire Tokyo. Then in 2023, they shadow-dropped their first non-horror themed Xbox title called Hi-Fi Rush, a game that combined hack n’ slash combat with rhythm game elements which went on to become one of the best Xbox titles of 2023.\n\nTango Gameworks has not formally announced any new games in development at this time. However, according to Gamerant and Twistedvoxal, there are rumors that Tango Gameworks may be working on a new JRPG project or that their next game will utilize the Unreal 5 Engine.\n\nMachine Games\n\nMachine Games’ main claim to fame is successfully rebooting the Wolfenstein franchise, a series of first-person shooters created by id Software. Right now Machine Games is currently working on a sequel to Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus (as confirmed by Bethesda via Variety), and a videogame based on the Indiana Jones franchise, which has been officially revealed with a trailer at the 2024 Xbox Developer Direct.\n\nThis game will have players control the titular archaeologist on a new globe-trotting adventure to recover a stolen artifact that could be the key to uncovering the mysterious 'Great Circle'. To help Indiana Jones succeed, players will need to use their wits and Indiana's iconic whip to solve devious puzzles within ancient ruins and battle evil villains plotting to use the \"Great Circle's'\" secrets for their own ends.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle will be coming out on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox Game Pass, and PC via Windows and Steam in 2024.\n\nZeniMax Online Studios\n\nZeniMax Online is the studio responsible for creating Elder Scrolls Online, an MMORPG based on Bethesda’s Elder Scrolls series that remains popular to this day even a decade after its 2014 release.\n\nAside from continuing to provide updates to Elder Scrolls Online (the most recent being a free roguelike game mode), ZeniMax Online is currently developing its next big AAA title (as stated on their official website).\n\nXbox Game Studios Publishing\n\nXbox Game Studios Publishing is partnering with a smorgasbord of developers to create a varied line-up of future Xbox titles. The publisher is also working with several unannounced independent studios to create new indie Xbox titles and a wide range of iPhone and Android games based on popular Xbox franchises.\n\nDuring the long court case battle between Xbox vs. FTC, it was revealed that Microsoft is working with IO Interactive, the creators of the Hitman series, on an Xbox-exclusive title called “Project Dragon”. IO Interactive also has another project in works called “Project Fantasy” but it’s currently unknown if this is a reworked version of Project Dragon, a separate game entirely, what it will entail, or what platforms it will be released on.\n\nMicrosoft has also announced that they’re partnering with Avalanche Studios group, the creators of the Just Cause franchise to produce Contraband. This game is looking to be a multiplayer-focused co-op shooter where teams of 4-players plan and pull off dangerous heists during the 1970s.\n\nAnother game Xbox Game Studios Publishing is working on is a game currently titled “Project Shaolin” an action game being developed by Brass Lion Entertainment that will feature the popular hip-hop group, the Wu-Tang-Clan.\n\nNext up on their line-up is Ara: History Untold (originally codenamed Indus), a 4X strategy game developed by Oxide Games where the player is put in charge of creating a civilization and leading it to economic and technological prosperity through the ages.\n\nAnother project lined up on Microsoft's docket is \"Project Maverick\", a mysterious game being developed in partnership with People Can Fly. People Can Fly is known for developing fast-paced, over-the-top shooters like Painkiller, Gears of War: Judgement, Bulletstorm, and Outriders.\n\nMicrosoft has even partnered up with Kojima Productions to create a new, Xbox-exclusive horror game called \"OD\" (originally codenamed \"Project Overdose\"). Kojima Productions is a studio founded by Hideo Kojima, the creator of the legendary Metal Gear franchise after he left Konami in 2015. Kojima Productions' first game before making OD is the surreal and haunting action-adventure game, Death Stranding.\n\nFinally, we have Towerborne (originally codenamed “Project Belfry”), an upcoming cooperative beat ‘em up/action-RPG developed by Stoic, the makers of the Banner Saga series. This game will task players (be they solo or in groups of up to 4 players) to journey through a fantasy land to save mankind’s last safe sanctuary, Belfry, from being destroyed by a horde of evil monsters.\n\nThere are many other mysterious videogame codenames we’ve discovered that we’ve yet to connect developers and projects, which hammers home that Microsoft is putting out all the stops to grow the diversity of their upcoming Xbox games.\n\nBeenox\n\nOriginally renowned for Tony Hawk ports and creating Spider-Man games on the Xbox 360, Beenox is a subsidiary of Activision that is primarily known nowadays for assisting the development of popular franchises like Skylanders, Crash Bandicoot and Call of the Duty. The last game Beenox has personally developed was Crash Team Nitro-Fueled, a remaster of the beloved racing game spin-off of Crash Bandicoot, Crash Team Racing.\n\nSince then, Beenox hasn’t announced any new projects that they’re personally developing and are currently assisting Sledgehammer Games with providing updates for 2023’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.\n\nHigh Moon Studios Inc\n\nHigh Moon Studios Inc. is a subsidiary developer of Activision known for assisting in development of Call of Duty and Destiny games and creating two of the best Transformers games ever made – Transformers: War for Cybertron and Transformers: Fall of Cybertron. Sadly, we have not seen any activity from High Moon Studios Inc. since it finished assisting Treyarch and Raven Software in releasing Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War in 2020,\n\nNow that Microsoft has finished acquiring Activision-Blizzard, there is a possibility that we could see High Moon’s Transformers games come back as either remasters or new additions to Xbox Game Pass.\n\nInfinity Ward\n\nInfinity Ward is the studio responsible for creating Activision’s monolith Call of Duty franchise. Their last major contributions to the series were Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and a free-to-play battle royale title called Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0, which has been played by over 25 million players as of November 2022.\n\nInfinity Ward has not announced any games in the works at this time.\n\nTreyarch\n\nTreyarch is another one of Activision’s subsidiary developers which are primarily known for developing the Call of Duty Black Ops series. Treyarch’s last major work was 2018's Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, and assisting Sledgehammer Games in developing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 in 2023.\n\nWe have recently discovered that Treyarch is now preparing to create a new entry in the Black Ops series.\n\nSledgehammer Games\n\nSledgehammer Games is a developer that has helped Activision in the past to create various Call of Duty. Sledgehammer Games was eventually chosen to be the lead developer of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, which released in 2023 and brought a wave of nostalgia for old-school fans while refining the gunplay formula.\n\nSledgehammer Games hasn’t got announced any new titles as of yet but it is hard work providing post-launch updates to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, the most recent of which introduced a wealth of accessibility options.\n\nToys for Bob\n\nToys for Bob is most famous for creating the Skylanders franchise and pioneering the “toys-to-life” genre, a sub-genre of games that allowed compatible toys to interact with the gameplay. In recent years, Toys for Bob has remastered the classic Spyro the Dragon games with the Spyro Reignited Trilogy, produced the long-awaited Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, and aided the development of several Call of Duty games.\n\nToys for Bob's last major game released was Crash Team Rumble in 2023, a platform-fighter where you play as various heroes and villains from the Crash Bandicoot franchise, and duke it out in chaotic 4v4 brawls. Aside from implementing post-launch updates for Crash Team Rumble, Toys for Bob has not announced a new game in the works at this time.\n\nBlizzard Entertainment\n\nBlizzard Entertainment is one of gaming’s biggest developers, creating some of the most popular franchises in the world that revolutionizing genres. Blizzard Entertainment’s stellar catalog includes the likes of the long-running fantasy MMORPG World of Warcraft, the tactical sci-fi RTS Starcraft, the competitive hero-shooter Overwatch, the dark action-RPG series Diablo, the addictive card game Hearthstone, and many more.\n\nBlizzard Entertainment is always busy developing new titles or providing updates to existing and 2024’s looking to be a pretty big one for the company. World of Warcraft will be celebrating its 20th anniversary this year with its tenth expansion, World of Warcraft: The War Within, which is set to release during the summer.\n\nOverwatch 2 just received its 39th Hero character, Mauga, on December 5th, 2023, and will be receiving new content in 2024 including more heroes, new maps, new game mods, and more.\n\nOn Hearthstone's end, Blizzard Entertainment will continue to provide it with new updates, new cards for players to collect, and more expansions like the \"Showdown in the Badlands\" which was released recently in November 2023.\n\nAfter releasing the long-awaited Diablo 4 on June 5th, 2023, and adding post-launch Seasonal updates, Blizzard Entertainment is planning to release its first expansion, Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred, in late 2024. All we know about this expansion is that it will feature new classes, classic locales from Diablo 2, and the return of an iconic Diablo villain, Mephisto.\n\nBlizzard Entertainment was also working on a survival game code-named \"Project Odyssey\" but it has been canceled by Microsoft due to layoffs across its entire gaming division.\n\nA colossal backlog of games\n\nXbox has been criticized in the past for having a limited number of first-party titles compared to its competitors like Sony and Nintendo. However, Microsoft has soundly laid that critique to rest with the monumental tidal wave of first-person Xbox games we’ve received over the past year.\n\n2023 has been a very fruitful year for Xbox in particular as it produced some of the best Xbox games from a wide range of first-party studios. Halo Infinite made a huge comeback in 2023 thanks to its ongoing updates, the long-awaited Diablo IV breathed next-gen life into Blizzard Entertainment’s long-running Diablo franchise, and Tango Gameworks’ new IP, Hi-Fi Rush, came out of nowhere and stole the award for our personal Best game of 2023.\n\n2024 and beyond is going to be even more insane for Xbox platforms with tons of upcoming Xbox games to look forward to. In 2024, we’ll be seeing the release of highly anticipated titles like Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, Avowed, and more. Then in the far future, we’ll be seeing Playground’s reimagining of the Fable franchise, Arkane Studio’s videogame interpretation of Marvel’s vampire hunter, Blade, and the sixth major entry in Bethesda’s Elder Scrolls series with Elder Scrolls VI to name a few.\n\nXbox Game Pass will also be getting a significant increase to its game library as now that Microsoft owns Activision Blizzard, we can expect to see franchises like Overwatch, Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, Diablo 4, and Call of Duty added in the future. On top of that, the Xbox platform will be receiving just as important third-party titles on the horizon including Grand Theft Audio 6, Monster Hunter Wilds, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl, the Xbox version of Final Fantasy XIV, and more.",

      "# [PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS](https://pubg.wiki.gg/wiki/PLAYERUNKNOWN%27S_BATTLEGROUNDS)\nPLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) is a Battle Royale game in which players are pitted against one another in a fight for survival released on March 23, 2017 for Steam. Roughly a year later, PUBG was released on Xbox One on September 4th, 2018 and later on December 7th, 2018 for the PlayStation 4. PUBG moved to a Free 2 Play model on January 12th, 2022.\n\nLooking for specific versions? You can find those pages at PC / Xbox / PlayStation / Mobile.\n\nAbout BATTLEGROUNDS\n\nPLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) is a competitive survival shooter formally developed/published by Bluehole. PUBG is now being developed by PUBG Corp, a Bluehole subsidiary company [1] in cooperation with Brendan Greene (PLAYERUNKNOWN) as the Creative Director, PUBG is Greene's first standalone game.\n\nPlayers are dropped into a wide, open area, and they must fight to the death - all while the battlefield shrinks, adding pressure to all in its grip. Use a variety of interesting weapons and vehicles amid the BATTLEGROUNDS. \"Killing off another player cuts down on your competition, but it also offers up the opportunity to grab some loot. Your character can only carry around a limited amount of gear, so there are important questions to ask whenever you come across new items. Is it better to stick with your current 9mm pistol, or hold out hope that you'll be able to find ammo for a found 12 gauge shotgun?\"\n\nBATTLEGROUNDS is running on Unreal Engine 4, players take on the Battle Royale experience on one of four maps, each with different characteristics. BATTLEGROUNDS is a good balance between Arma 3 and H1Z1.\n\nBackground/back story?\n\nBATTLEGROUNDS takes place on different islands (maps), but the main island for BATTLEGROUNDS is called Erangel. An abandoned Russian island where a military occupation was controlling the island. The military occupation tested chemical/biological experiments on the islands population, after a resistance attack on a biological facility, the island had to be abandoned.\n\nSpawning into the game?\n\nWhen you spawn, everyone in the game gets put in on a small island where you wait x amount of minutes to load into the game (here to make the players load into the game properly with all the assets, etc.). After the time limit is up during the starting area, you get teleported in a paradrop plane, you get flown over an area and then you get thrown out of a plane with a parachute. Once landed, loot spawns in different areas, it's based on the Arma 3 model, it's all random. The loot system is a lot more in-depth than H1Z1, so there will be more time spent farming for better weapons/attachments/armor, etc.\n\n-- All weapons/items that are on the player or weapon itself don't take up inventory space in your backpack. You can have 1 grenade on your character, while any extra grenades you pick up take up space.\n\nTrivia\n\nThe map name Erangel is based off of PLAYERUNKNOWN's daughter name.\n\nThe Dacia sedan is based off of when PLAYERUNKNOWN watched Top Gear and they always talked about it. Small Top Gear reference/Easter Egg.\n\nBikeMan's dad passed away, in honor of him on the side of Motorcycle w/ sidecar, it has the picture of his dad.\n\nThe designers that are behind the player customization are the those who did it in APB: Reloaded.\n\nPUBG wasn't the first acronym they chose. It was originally called 'PUB' & 'PUGS.' But it was later on changed to PUBG due to the relation of 'PUB' that is common with Pub/bar related search results.\n\nThe saying Winner Winner Chicken Dinner shown for winners at the end of the match. It's featured from PLAYERUNKNOWN's early Battle Royale games/mods.[2]\n\n-- For more Easter Eggs, head to Easter Eggs.\n\nDevelopment\n\nPre-Alpha (NDA) | June - September 2016\n\nAlpha (No NDA) | October - December 2016\n\nClosed Beta | February - March 2017 [3]\n\nSteam Early Access | March 23, 2017 [4]\n\nXbox One Game Preview Release | December 12, 2017 [5]\n\nFull Release | December 21, 2017 Originally, the game was suppose to get out of EA in 6 months from March 23.\n\nFull Xbox One Release | September 4th, 2018\n\nPUBG Project Thai | September, 2018 [6]\n\nPS4 Release | December 7th, 2018\n\nPUBG Project Thai renamed to 'PUBG LITE.' | January 24th, 2019 [7]\n\nGoogle Stadia version of PUBG was released on April 28th, 2020.\n\nPUBG went Free 2 Play on January 12th, 2022.

      "# [xbox.com @ PissedConsumer by Ansen Jtc, Monet G Ydg, Cecil B Pal, Dustin S Ocl, Janet B Hpk, Geremy Czy, Tonetta Zpu, Agueda Hgc, Baran K Yny, Nyana Rod on 2024-10-30](https://xbox.pissedconsumer.com/review.html)\nMy Xbox, Microsoft, Google, and Epic Games accounts were recently hacked, and I discovered unauthorized logins dating back to September 6, 2024, from locations such as China and Germany. Unfortunately, I did not become aware of these breaches until September 24, 2024 when Microsoft locked my accounts due to suspicious login attempts giving the hackers access to all my Microsoft accounts including the authentication app for nearly 20 days.\n\nAt that point, Microsoft walked me through the process of recovering my accounts, and while most were restored, my Xbox account remained inaccessible.\n\nMicrosoft customer service was unable to explain why my Xbox inventory purchased with over $6,626.29 since 2017 was missing. I was advised to log into my Epic Games account to verify if it was still linked. However, I soon discovered the hackers had locked me out of my Epic account as well. Once I regained access, I found that my gamer tag had been changed and my account had been altered.\n\nIn the process of attempting to reconnect my accounts, I learned that Xbox enforcement had indefinitely suspended my account without any clear explanation.\n\nI have been a customer since 2017 and have never received a strike or any violation warnings on my account. Despite this, my account was suspended without any communication or guidance on who to contact for assistance.\n\nMicrosoft directed me to the Xbox Enforcement page stating all information as to why my Xbox account had been suspended would be located within my account but the only explanation given was a vague reference to a violation of Xboxs terms of service or code of conduct. Which I reviewed and even consulted my attorney about, who asked me a few questions and explained the contract in depth confirming that I have not violated any terms or the code of conduct. It is deeply concerning that my account was closed without a clear reason or the opportunity to address any alleged violations.\n\nI believe Xbox has failed in its legal obligation to provide transparency and due process in enforcing its terms of service.\n\nBy suspending my account indefinitely without explanation or recourse knowing my account was compromised within the time frame they are alleging this took place, and by failing to properly secure my account against a clear and extended hacking event, Microsoft and Xbox has potentially breached its contractual obligations. I expect a resolution to this issue and accountability for the financial and emotional toll this has taken.",

      "# [Juicy Xbox Game Scoops! Perfect Dark, DOOM, State Of Decay 3 by Rafi Ahmed on 2024-05-15](https://esportsnext.com/juicy-xbox-game-scoops-perfect-dark-doom-state-of-decay-3/)\nWell, ahoy, fellow Xbox game enthusiasts! Today, we got some juicy Xbox game scoops for y’all. Yep, not just for one or two titles, but for three whole AAA games. Finally, some good news, right? The whole of last week was a depressing, never-ending nightmare, what with the whole Microsoft disaster and all. So, we needed this bit of positivity to lift our spirits and take solace in knowing Microsoft is finally ready. Or at least ready enough to show us something new from their gaming line-up.\n\nTake note that some of the info we’re gettin’ isn’t through official channels; it’s by some leaks or rumor mill. But it is reliable, so more than likely, what you’ll see from us is gonna end up true. But if it ain’t, well, you know what they say about rumors and hearsay, don’t pay it no mind. The bottom line is that we’re tired of Microsoft playing defense, and the timing of this series of “leaks” fits with the summer reveals Microsoft has planned. So, in short, we’re pretty confident in our stance here. Now, let’s dive into these 3 juicy nuggets of info.\n\nWhich Juicy Xbox Game Scoops Have Got Us Buzzing With Excitement?\n\nAlrighty, then~ so, first, we’re gonna address the big elephant in the room. There are plenty of classic games that we really wanna see Xbox make remakes of. One Xbox game, in particular, is gonna be from those that we’re gonna give you the juicy scoops about. So, yay! But sadly, there’s still plenty of radio silence on what the heck the other Xbox Game Studios are working on.\n\nFunnily enough, all 3 games in question were announced during the earlier tenure of Uncle Phil Spencer, who recently completed his decade-long milestone at Xbox. It just baffles the mind how time sure flies and how ill-managed Microsoft was in its Xbox brand. But hey, better late than never, right? Besides, that’s a worry for another time; today, we focus on what we do know!\n\nSo, without further ado, the three games in question, which we’ll discuss separately, are: The Perfect Dark reboot, a new DOOM game, and then there’s the positive update on State Of Decay 3. Yeah, sorry, no new Halo or Gears game, sadly, but hey, at this point, we’ll take what we can get our hands on. Anyway, it’s time to throw caution to the wind and see what the juicy Xbox game scoops we got for you! Here we go!\n\nThe Perfect Dark Reboot Is Something We Xbox Gamers Want, Nay, Need In Our Lives\n\nArguably, the most anticipated Xbox game that we’re pleased to have juicy scoops about is The Perfect Dark Reboot. So, in case y’all are unaware, The Perfect Dark is a stealth FPS game famous for a lot of brilliant and truly original ideas. With bizarre and surreal storytelling and gameplay features that hold up even today. It’s got corporate espionage conspiracies, innovative level design with freedom of mission structure, and, of course, sci-fi aliens.\n\nThe original Perfect Dark is one of the most unique games with hot and cool female heroines in Johanna Dark. She’s a deadly femme fatale who enjoys her line of work. She dresses to impress and turns heads with her petite figure that’s deceptively athletic and combat savvy and her provocative attire, which she flaunts unapologetically. Plus, she has a charmingly cute Brit accent, too. She’s perfect! (Sorry, not sorry for the pun~).\n\nRelated: Stellar Blade Review: Stylish Action Gaming Just Found A Queen.\n\nHow Is Perfect Dark Shaping Up?\n\nThe Perfect Dark Reboot imagines a futuristic sci-fi backdrop where Johanna Dark’s skillset is even more of an asset. The alien invasion aspect was shown in a few reveal footage from back when the game was under production. Suffice to say, we were more than hyped for the game. But that was back in 2020, and now until recently, we’ve not seen anything or heard from Microsoft or even Uncle Phil Spencer, for that matter.\n\nThe complete ignorance and keeping the franchise under wraps for this long was a sign of trouble in development. Last week, there was a false alarm regarding The Perfect Dark Reboot when Microsoft was busy making Xbox fans angry. Thankfully, however, the status quo is much better now. The piece of uplifting news and juicy Xbox game scoops came from GiantBomb’s Jeff Grub on X (formerly known as Twitter). He said that The Perfect Dark Reboot has its rough edges; there’s no denying it.\n\nHowever, he continues after that bit to give us hope. He says the more people he spoke to internally who’ve playtested the game, the more the feedback shifted towards the positive end of the spectrum. People seemed to enjoy their time with the current state of the game. Some standout highlights were even mentioned that Jeff didn’t get into details for. There is some indication that we might get to see Johasnna Dark steal the show during the Xbox June 2024 Game Showcase. So, keep your eyes peeled for that.\n\nState Of Decay 3 Update Is Full Of Promise, Hope, And Hopefully Excellence\n\nOh, boy, another Xbox Game Studio title that we have some positively juicy scoops for. Is it Christmas already? Joking aside, though, State Of Decay 3 is a game with zero exposure since its reveal. It’s problematic when a game dev’s so quiet, but thankfully that is no longer the case now. Why? Well, before we dive into the specifics here’s a bit of trivia about State Of Decay 3.\n\nSo, the entirety of the State Of Decay series is all about sandbox survival tactics. Think the Walking Dead-esque post-apocalyptic backdrop while more immersive life sim elements take center stage. You gotta be mindful of your character’s needs, while also finding any and all means to brave the harsh challenges of the game. From the elements and wilderness, not to mention other player’s cunnings, there is a plethora of things to do.\n\nSo far, we’ve had two entries in the franchise and State Of Decay 3 has only got one CGI trailer to its credit. Nothing else. We know Undead Labs is the Xbox Games Studio behind the scenes at the helm, but do you know who else is lending a hand? It’s The Coalition, the freaking Gears Of War studio. Oh, this game better be darn good, ’cause if it’s the reason we don’t have Gears 6 yet. Or else we’re rioting!\n\nWhat’s The Word On State Of Decay 3?\n\nOkay, so here’s the insider with reputable sources inside the gaming world. The host of the Xbox Two podcast, Jez Corden, recently on his show gave some little breadcrumbs about State Of Decay 3. Basically, he was pretty stoked about the state of the game, giving it high praise. The exact phrasing was along the lines of:\n\n“I’ll put out there that it (State Of Decay 3) is doing very, very well, and looks very, very good.”\n\nNow, we’re no linguistics experts, but those sound like the words of a fanboy who’s very happy to see a favourite game of his living up to his expectations. Seriously, we share the sentiment and enthusiasm of Mr. Jez Corden. These are exactly the sort of juicy Xbox game scoops we need to keep our hope for Xbox’s future in the games industry alive.\n\nCan you seriously imagine what kind of mindblowing features and gameplay magic will happen if Microsoft pulls this off successfully? We honestly cannot wait for the actual gameplay footage to drop. Or the actual release date for that matter. The refinement of the gunplay of State Of Decay 3, in particular, with the help from The Coalition studio, is making us salivate.\n\nOur Juicy Xbox Scoops Point You To The New Trademark Filing By Bethesda; It’s DOOM\n\nAaaand, finally, the last bit of our juicy Xbox game scoops is concluding with a bang, literally. Why? Well, ’cause Bethesda’s parent company, Zenimax recently filed a trademark with the title ‘IDKFA’. Now, to the average Joe/Jane gamer, it might not mean much, or it could mean absolute gibberish. But those in the know, and from the retro gaming era, know that it’s a reference to the cheat code from the classic DOOM games.\n\nRelated: The 10 Greatest Action Adventure Games From The PS1 Era.\n\nIf y’all don’t know, DOOM is a classic video game series that’s recently been rebooted in the past decade. With Doom (2016), Doom Eternal, and hell, even the Mighty DOOM game, we’ve been enjoying the new styles of the games. The forward momentum aggression in these titles is ridiculously addictive. We even have the mainline reboot of DOOM among the greatest action games of all time. Now, let’s talk about the recent buzz surrounding DOOM and a potential new entry, possibly this year.\n\nA New DOOM Entry Would Be Utterly Delightful For Xbox Fans\n\nSo, we mentioned the above trademark filing by Zenimax, right? Well, here’s where things get interesting. You see, in the recent coverage of Xbox’s abysmal game studio shutdown plans (here’s our hot take on it, by the way). Anyway, The Verge’s Tom Warren ended his piece with one heck of a teaser. It’s subtle but those with a keen eye will spot it. Basically, he spoke of how Microsoft’s gonna be winning fans over to their side. On a side note, if you’re saddened by the closure of Xbox Game Studios like Tango Gameworks, we’re honoring their legacy by giving you recommendations for games like Hi-Fi RUSH.\n\nRelated: Microsoft Needs To Turn Up The Aggression To Win Players Over.\n\nSo, as Mr. Tom was continuing his train of thought, he goes ‘Microsoft is going to be banking on new game announcements for lifting the DOOM around Xbox.’ The word DOOM was italicized and highlighted to stand apart from the rest of the report. Now, if we put on our detective hats and put the recent trademark filing along with this reputable journalist’s words together, there’s a high likelihood of a new DOOM game popping up soon-ish.\n\nOf course, if it turns out to be true, that opens the door to all kinds of possibilities. One of them is that the new DOOM game might be a series prequel that’s long been floated around. However, until we know more, it’s only a little glimmer of hope to hold onto, nothing more. But, at this point, there’s just too much at stake for Xbox to not deliver. We sincerely hope they do. ‘Cause a new DOOM game is gonna bring the hype and thunder back to camp Xbox. Thus, concludes our juicy Xbox game scoops for the day.\n\nFinal Thoughts On The Juicy Xbox Game Scoops\n\nAnd, that’s a wrap, folks. Our juicy hot takes and game scoops for Xbox come to a close now. So, then, what’s the verdict, y’all? Do you feel any sort of excitement from these leaks, rumors, and deliberate tactical marketing? Or would you rather wait and see how things turn out? Honestly, it’s anybody’s guess at this point ’cause a lot of the time, games get announced but get stuck in development hell. Or they come out as mediocre and get bombed to the bottom of the barrel pile. Either way, we’re cautiously optimistic ’cause we actually want stiff competition in the gaming industry. Otherwise, it’s gonna be a monopoly, which is never good for the customers."
