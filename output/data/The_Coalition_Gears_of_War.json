The only logical reasoning for majority of the posts I saw was, \"gears was released every 2 years, it's been 4 since gears 5\".\n\nI do not by any means consider myself an industry insider, so take what I have to say with a grain of salt, but I do try to reference as many sources as I can. I'm just been a life long gears fan, who reads gears news. \n\nI really hate to be the bearer of bad news, if we get a \"gears reveal\" it's not coming this year. \nStarfield is the game Microsoft is pushing this holiday season. \n\nhttps://gamerant.com/gears-war-3-delayed-microsoft-big-holiday-title\n\nIf we get shown gears, it's not coming until next Christmas at the earliest. \n\nThe Coalition has stated they are working on a new ip as well as \"the future of gears\" \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/teu8oc/rip_gears_esports_tc_working_on_the_future_of/\n\nIf it wasn't gears 6, I saw \"we are getting\" \"The Marcus Collection\" (we will probably never get) that would divide the studio between more projects. I would love to see Judgement on the proper gow3 control scheme. It probably won't happen though. \nJust for reference from the time TC was formed to the time Gears of war ultimate edition was released was about a year.\n\nLast may (about a year ago) TC announced all future projects will be developed with unreal engine 5. \nhttps://www.thecoalitionstudio.com/the-future-of-gears-5/\n\nWould you really want them to push out of 3-4 fully Remastered games in a brand new engine in about a year when the last one took them about a year to do? \n\nUpdate Gears of war a retrospective author talks about how \"a collection if it's coming is still a long way off\" \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/143fg49/gears_collection_and_ue_5_from_supervising_editor/\n\nI could be completely wrong on all of this and a part of me hopes that I am. I would really set that expectation bar low for gears at the showcase. Fable was also shown at a previous show, this is also likely the game Microsoft pushes next year. \n\nI expect this to be not a popular opinion, and down voted heavily.\n\nAlso no gears movie or TV trailers.\n\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-promises-no-full-cg-trailers-for-xbox-showcase-first-party-games\n\n## Comment ID jm9ve2t with +15 score by [(BChaps, Reddit, 2023-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/13w5llv/we_are_getting_gears_of_war_6_at_the_xbox/jm9ve2t/) (in reply to ID 13w5llv):\nTC doesn't even really have a Community Director or CM at this point.

It’s really pointless to beg and cry over something that won’t happen. I don’t anticipate anything about Gears 6.

That is it.  We are certainly not getting a gears of war game within the next 2 years, and if we do it'll be another low effort GaaS game like Halo Infinite and Gears 5, built overtime. \n\nPeople forget switching over to a new engine is at the very least 6 months to a year of training to be efficient at it, they struggled with decent content on the old engine they knew about let alone a new one.  The studio was also newly formed and that takes time to become cohesive and like clock work, not only that, but then they've gone and switched over to a new engine pipeline, technology also rapidly changes over short amounts of time in this industry.\n\nSo, yeah its likely in development now, but I wouldn't expect much.  A teaser with the logo and some minor visuals (literally a flash of visuals) is all we are likely to get, if not this year, then certainly within the next 2 years.   Remember, Fable has been in development for years, and they've still not shown it, its not even certain it'll show up at this most recent event.\n\nExpecting gameplay or a release date of Gears 6 is rather unrealistic, at most I expect a flash of Gears 6's logo, to let everyone know its in development and coming to build hype, because Xbox has been in dire straights as of late, I was even amazed at Halo even likely getting some air time for Season 4 trailer during the event.\n\nWith how redfall, Halo and Gears 5 turned out (not to be commercial successes day one) I can see them teasing Gears 6, but its equally as unlikely.\n\n### Comment ID jmkvd55 with +1 score by [(IamMovieMiguel, Reddit, 2023-06-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/13w5llv/we_are_getting_gears_of_war_6_at_the_xbox/jmkvd55/) (in reply to ID jmgiuhm):\nThank you!

But in \\[this\\] moment, we had an opportunity to write our next step, and this one just felt too good to miss.”  \n\n>It’s also important to note that E-Day is not a spin-off, it’s a completely new entry to the mainline series, set earlier in the timeline. The events of the game not only serve as an exciting origin tale of two beloved characters, but it also adds detail and context to this period that will resonate through stories that will follow. In E-day, the Locust are not foes that our characters are accustomed to fighting. They are mysterious, formidable and overwhelming – an unforeseen horror that Marcus, Dom, and the rest of Sera must learn to deal with before it’s too late. Everything that happens in *E-Day* will shape the future of Gears of War for the better.  \n\n>This is the Gears of War story you’ve always wanted to hear, and it’s going to be incredible.\n\nLink to the article for anyone interested in giving it a read - [Reinventing A Mad World: Why Gears of War: E-Day Represents the Future of the Series - Xbox Wire](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-interview-details-xbox-games-showcase-2024/)\n\n### Comment ID l7uvi5c with +3 score by [(C_Noticles, Reddit, 2024-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1dc0ccn/gears_of_war_eday_announced_xbox_games_showcase/l7uvi5c/) (in reply to ID l7ukj8n):\nShitty thing is is gears 6 could be amazing, but some people are still gonna dislike it cuz it's not the same as the first 3.\n\n## Comment ID l7ulatf with +12 score by [(CDHmajora, Reddit, 2024-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1dc0ccn/gears_of_war_eday_announced_xbox_games_showcase/l7ulatf/) (in reply to ID 1dc0ccn):\nWith this and Doom Dark ages, I actually have a reason to rebuy an Xbox now :D\n\nIt’s not a Marcus Fenix collection like I wanted, but I’m not gonna lie, I think deep down I just wanted more of Marcus and Dom together again (I honestly just don’t care much for Kait and JD despite me really trying too.

So many lighthearted moments. In Gears of War it’s Marcus, Dom and Delta Squad giving each other shit to make it through dangerous times. That’s the big difference. Having been in the military for 12 years, I personally know that when you’re embracing the suck THAT is when you make true friends and brotherly bonds.\n\nNot galavanting across settlements picking off robots to steal resources like it’s nothing.\n\n#### Comment ID l7uwnkk with +7 score by [(CDHmajora, Reddit, 2024-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1dc0ccn/gears_of_war_eday_announced_xbox_games_showcase/l7uwnkk/) (in reply to ID l7utsl4):\nI think this is one of my bigger problems with gears 4 and 5. It tries too hard to be funny. JD in 4 especially was always throwing wisecracks at everything like he was trying to impress his crush. The characters never really took the stakes seriously (like every interaction they have with Jinn in 4 is them just pissing her off by being smartasses. Then doing a pikachu face when she sends an army after them.).\n\nKait in 5 (I don’t remember much about her in 4 tbh outside of JD simping for her, and her treating Marcus like shit because he’s ex-COG.) honestly feels like she’s 15 at times and still going through puberty. She has more mood swings than Elon Musk on a Twitter rant. She has bipolar interactions with every ally she has. She’s selfish and makes everything about herself. And it always felt to me that they tried to make her “special” due to her heritage, but they had nothing else to do with her that advances the story in any meaningful way outside of that heritage.\n\nAnd Del? Who cares about him? Not to be mean but he always just felt like the token black guy to me. But without any of the charm and constantly positive outlook that Cole rocks (Cole’s awesome. His presence alone can overturn morale on even the most fucked up battlefields). He was supposed to be the “Dom” for JD, but just didn’t do anything at all because the writers really wanted Kait to be JD’s partner (remember the original gears 4 reveal? Del wasn’t there. He was absolutely added later on because they realised JD and Kait have shit chemistry together.). They admittedly did try to do stuff with Del in gears 5 to make him seem like the straight man of the trio who follows his heart more than the mission, but that just feels like he’s trying to copy Dom rather than give Del any agency of his own.\n\nSorry. This went off as a rant. And I won’t say I hate gears 4 and 5. There’s some good in 4, and plenty of good parts of gears 5. But the main protagonists are absolutely terrible compared to Delta squad and I honestly don’t think gears 6 will change that :/\n\n## Comment ID l7umfac with +22 score by [(GangstaManStan, Reddit, 2024-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1dc0ccn/gears_of_war_eday_announced_xbox_games_showcase/l7umfac/) (in reply to ID 1dc0ccn):\nI loved the depressing feel of the trailer. Makes me think we’re returning to our roots of an aesthetic/atmosphere similar to Gears 1-2. I also loved how they showcased the locust drones true strength. We’ve always been told how strong they are but outside of Gears 2 we were never truly shown how physically strong they are.\n\nSide note I’ve always wanted a story following young delta squad (assuming Cole and Baird show up but I doubt it since in Gears 1 they were strangers to Marcus and Dom), but after how bad Judgement was it kind of always slipped my mind. Any theories on what the story will be about? Probably just saving a city or trying to survive?\n\nThis is truly the best case scenario to be honest. I didn’t really care for a Gears 6, although I am very curious who survived Gears 5 JD or Del and what direction TC will go with that choice, and I was super hyped for a Gears collection, but this is better than both options IMO.\n\n### Comment ID l7uoe8k with +15 score by [(momo_46, Reddit, 2024-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1dc0ccn/gears_of_war_eday_announced_xbox_games_showcase/l7uoe8k/) (in reply to ID l7umfac):\nI hope they will not rush into the E-day and show Sera at peace\n\n#### Comment ID l7ut71d with +11 score by [(Shark_Bite_OoOoAh, Reddit, 2024-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1dc0ccn/gears_of_war_eday_announced_xbox_games_showcase/l7ut71d/) (in reply to ID l7uoe8k):\nIt’d be pretty awesome to start the game with the siege of Aspho Fields where Marcus and Carlos are fighting a tank on a bridge as infantry, and Dom is with Hoffman and the SpecOps team to steal the Hammer of Dawn technology from the UIR.\n\nThere Carlos meets his fate and we see how Marcus takes the loss.

I've waited so long for an old Gears styled game. People are free to like what they like but I was really disappointed with Gears 4. I never bothered with 5 and certainly didn't care for a 6th. I have been holding out hope for a Gears collection proper remaster. That was what I thought would be the only thing to bring me back. I'm genuinely looking forwards to seeing more from this game. \n\nI hope that if the game is good and they don't intend to expand from this game, that they're working on a proper remaster. I crave so badly to play the old original three, but I can't get used to how it plays and what not any more. I'd love a more fluid feel to the game but maintaining what made the series so good in the first place. Modernise it slightly so it plays better but finding that fine line of not making it something it isn't.\n\n## Comment ID l7us065 with +3 score by [(LonesomeWater, Reddit, 2024-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1dc0ccn/gears_of_war_eday_announced_xbox_games_showcase/l7us065/) (in reply to ID 1dc0ccn):\nLETS GO!\n\n## Comment ID l7usitx with +3 score by [(Akhmatov0501, Reddit, 2024-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1dc0ccn/gears_of_war_eday_announced_xbox_games_showcase/l7usitx/) (in reply to ID 1dc0ccn):\n🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡\n\n## Comment ID l7v5fvl with +3 score by [(LostSoulNo1981, Reddit, 2024-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1dc0ccn/gears_of_war_eday_announced_xbox_games_showcase/l7v5fvl/) (in reply to ID 1dc0ccn):\nExcuse my language…\n\nFUCK YEAH!!!\n\nI’ve been waiting for an E-Day game for years!\nLet’s hope they don’t fuck it up and they actually stick to previously established lore.\n\nI’m already kind of hopeful as Marcus was using the mk.1 lancer.\n\n## Comment ID l7ump9h with +6 score by [(Doodenmier, Reddit, 2024-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1dc0ccn/gears_of_war_eday_announced_xbox_games_showcase/l7ump9h/) (in reply to ID 1dc0ccn):\nI'm **hyped** for it whenever it comes, but at the same time, this short reveal leaves me with a few concerns. Specifically, we don't have *any* details besides it being a prequel for Marcus and Dom, so I assume we're nowhere near launch yet. And I know some people are burned out by the Kait story, but it kind of signals to me that we're going to have a decade+ between Gears 5 and its sequel, especially if E-Day is considered a mainline game rather than a spinoff like Judgement\n\nI just hope horde is back and we have proper enemy diversity.

I have been itching for more Marcus as a protagonist since 2011.\n\nBut I would’ve preferred ultimately that we get Gears 6 with grizzled Marcus as its main protagonist, with this tone more or less, and advertised as the end of the new trilogy.\n\nAnd then, after that, give us Gears E-Day. Because I’m fucking here for it. I am stoked and will be playing this day one. I’m just not a fan of the waiting more than half a decade to continue stories that has been happening more and more this gen.

Last Gears game was in 2019, 7 years are way too much... Not to mention that if Gears 6 needs 5-6 years after they are done with E-Day that means the next chapter of Gears 5 story will come 13-14 years after Gears 5!

They lock developers into a franchise and they are also unwilling to put on-hold the development of games for their biggest franchises.

It seems to be an issue with the vast majority of horror franchises (in all media) in that the more you learn about the world/enemies/antagonist the less, well, scary it gets.\n\nGears 1 and 2 were gritty horror games because we (in-game characters and players) all were learning about the Locust and their capabilities in real-time. Everything after that can't have that same feel because there's nothing truly new to learn about the Locust/Swarm (For all its faults, credit to Gears 4 for at least trying with how it sent us into the hive of the Swarm).\n\nDon't get me wrong, I miss the vibe of Gears 1 and 2 too. I just don't know how The Coalition (or even Epic for that matter) can keep telling horror stories AND filling out the lore of the Locust. \n\nI fully agree on one thing though, at minimum we need blood and guts back when we chainsaw enemies! They're all rated M, so why hold back?!\n\n### Comment ID kbafzgf with +2 score by [(Fabulous_Comb1830, Reddit, 2023-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/186roqx/gears_of_war_creator_reminds_microsoft_you_have/kbafzgf/) (in reply to ID kba6rpj):\nOnly played the first one.

I think one major criticism of Gears5 is its storytelling choices. \n\n\nFor example, the protagonist in previous Gears is willing to risk his life to go into a locust territory to help his friend that will most likely get himself killed. That kind of supportive story is beautiful. And we have Gears5, there is almost no connection to the companion, it is as if the guy is just a robot or slave or unwanted tag along, just sad.

We have a mutual friend who introduced us. At that time, his studio closed and he was just not really into making games at that point. He didn’t even really want to play them. He ended up investing his money into his other passion: Broadway. \n\nHe loves musicals and threw money at Hadestown which did well from what I know. I’m not a Broadway guy but it seems popular enough for me to know about them. \n\nHe also owns a bar in the Carolinas where you can see him do some karaoke and some questionable stand up comedy. \n\nOther than that, we walked around a bunch and he was willing to take us out for drinks but I was incredibly tired. It was a long day of me gluing stuff to my wife’s cosplay as it fell off. \n\nEither way, we had a fine interaction. He is incredibly aware of how people view him and he’s made peace with it.

It's been mostly fixed, but these things hurt the game.\n\nThe story is... Not the best. The bland characters mean you don't really get invested. \n\nJD in Gears 4 is basically just \"the son of Marcus Pheonix\" with very little to actually like. In 5 he gets sidelined after being wreckless, but never really letting us see how it affected him. We just have him show up, scarred and sort of grown. Addressing very little of his character development. \n\nKait, is interesting... At least in terms of how people react to her. We're given a little about her throughout 4 with who she is in the grander story being more important than trying to let the player get to know her. With how the story starts some time has passed since 4 in the 5th installment. It's s implied that her connection to the Locusts/Swarm has been progressing. This is where a lot of people really get lost in weeds on liking her or not. Most dislike her because they think she's a whining crybaby. I'm not going to say they're wrong. But if most of these people were put through the wringer like she has, they'd likely act similarly. Though we're given very little to like beyond some small moments, so regardless of the \"whining\" being justified or not, there's very little to like. \n\nDel is great as a secondary character. He's the supportive friend that has some tech knowledge. In 4 he's meh, while in 5 he's actually a much stronger character throughout. He even manages to get a few chuckles out of me in some cutscenes. Along with actually trying to talk about problems with his friends. He's one of the better new characters, as controversial of an opinion as that might be to some people.\n\nFahz... Uh he's apparently kind of popular. I don't really get it. He's an A-hole who turns out to not be as much on A-hole as your initially led to believe. Which isn't terrible, but similar to Del he fills his role well enough.\n\nIt's really funny that I loved the characters in hivebusters. They were actually fun and we'll written, on top of giving us a varied but short campaign. I loved it in general over the main story and it proves the devs can make a fun but somewhat serious story. \n\nOn top of the characters the story was just so... Meh. 4 was literally just a story to justify sequels, and 5 for some reason felt the need to explain the origin of the Locusts. Which kind of did very little for the story, and offered minimal real payoff when you can predict it in the first hour or so. \n\nThen the open world. Which basically just replaced the vehicle/turret sections, and didn't add much. But was the biggest addition to the campaign. It was honestly kind of disappointing, and made things just feel slow.\n\nFinally. One of the biggest reasons Gears in general hasn't really taken off, is the multiplayer. When it's 90% people just bouncing around with shotguns, mostly getting one-shot. You're either on of the few people that likes it, or you can't get into the multiplayer pretty much at all. As satisfying as it is once you get the hang of it, it's not for everyone. \n\nWhich is why I'm surprised horde doesn't get more love. I get that escape was added too, but I feel like multiplayer PvE content is  much more palatable to the vast majority of gamers when it comes to Gears. Because the alternative is \"fixing\" PvP to be more appealing to general audiences. Which would kill the game for its fans. \n\nIt's sad to say, but as fun and exciting as the game can be. It's just not being handled correctly by Microsoft and The Coalition.\n\n### Comment ID ichayxc with +8 score by [(javycane, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/ichayxc/) (in reply to ID icgrf62):\nYour last sentence sums it up lol.\n\n### Comment ID iciqanm with +6 score by [(FelledWolf, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/iciqanm/) (in reply to ID icgrf62):\nTo tack onto this, gears horde used to be where I can load a map and have a chatoic session with no having to prepare cards and classes and gather power.. those mechanics are not fun for me.

There are third person games like fortnite that have much more verticality and run and gun style movement with zero reliance on a cover system. There’s other third person cover shooters that are slower and more tactically paced. \n\nGears has a weird spot in the middle. Grounded gameplay with extremely twitchy run and cover gameplay. Watch an absolute sweat play the game, and it looks like they’re having a stroke between walls and one-shotting everyone.\n\nThe biggest gears fans are people that have been playing the game since forever ago. I doubt their ability to attract and retain new players is that strong\n\n## Comment ID icg6w4o with +21 score by [(XGothWolfX, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/icg6w4o/) (in reply to ID vcttwn):\nWell it is almost 3 years old at this point, lol\n\n### Comment ID icg843d with +7 score by [(Qwertykeybaord, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/icg843d/) (in reply to ID icg6w4o):\nI don't believe it is the age of the game that defines its low playercount, but rather a fundamental way on how this game is promoted on the market.\n\nAs you can see there are multiple shooter games released many years ago and still having an active player base in the hundreds of thousands every day.\n\nI have played pretty much every game on the market since I was a kid and the fluidity and grittiness of being inside a combative state in Gears is unmatched. \n\nThe feel, the sounds and the action of fighting an opponent, alone or with your team is just so REAL. \n\nGears deserves to become a low cost multiplayer promoted franchise that focuses on the true competitive aspect of its player vs player modes.\n\nI see this game being played by the top streamers if it promoted as such.\n\nA competitive world filled with players fighting for their lives on ranked and more casual modes; blasting it off with gore, sound effects and total chaos.\n\nIt is truly a unique game and its multiplayer genuineness is something that can be enjoyed by a multitude of players for years to come.\n\n#### Comment ID ichjfok with +4 score by [(vICarnifexIv, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/ichjfok/) (in reply to ID icg843d):\nAye man I’ve played all the Gears as they released and all I can say is Gears 3 multiplayer was peak for me.

I've been playing since 2006.  \n\nGears 4/5 had an AWFUL launch where we were literally dip fed content for months.  Gears 4 was basically unplayable on PC unless you were using 2 year old graphics drivers.  The new series (imo) has a much less exciting campaign which doesn't draw in new players.  I can't convince my friends to play the series even though I'm absolutely in love with it because they have no way to play it on PC and none of us have picked up a controller in about a decade.  \n\nThey need to come out swinging with a collection of the first 3 games like MCC did.  No issues, ALL the content of those games and more.  Then they need to hype/advertise the absolutely shit out of Gears 6 (none of that bury a friend trailer bullshit, something like the Gears 3 ashes to ashes/dust to dust, or Gears 4 tomorrow trailer that make you feel actual emotion) and the game needs to actually be good enough to back up the hype.  \n\nHalo was able to make some sort of a comeback.

Some objective, some subjective.\n\nFirst off I think this series has plateud in quality. IMO the biggest drop in quality is the campaign. It's bland and forgettable. We have a whiny protag who gets pulled along and makes selfish decisions. Dom breaking Marcus out of prison already kinda attaches me to this chad who broke me out. Also, there is much less care put towards the gritty gore nature of combat. Cement chunks don't come off low walls, guts don't stay on the floor, you name it. Gritty, gore, and guts was what differentiated this game from CoD. You look at a bunch of games trailers and GoW 1-3 stood out because of that. And now it's just very bland generic looking less thick people shooting at each other. Wooptido. And guess what our next quest is? Is it a hammer of dawn related mission? Is grass green? The game gets rid of epic setpiece moments like riding a brumak or a whole campaign inside a worm in favor of open world. You get a discount black guy who might as well not exist. And let's just accept the fact that they likely can't beat the original trilogy's characters or story.\n\nSecond, barely any innovation. Maybe someone will argue about this. But gears 5 looks like it went backward 2 notches. Sure the graphics are nicer, but 1 to 2 to 3 were slapping the crap out of the gaming space when it comes to innovative gameplay. First time you blew up a guy with a wall nade was fun AF. I hated the server advantage back then but boy was it fun. We also got horde mode long time ago. What new came out after? Now its just the same rehashed multiplayer with microtransacrions.\n\nThird, the decline of Xbox. Microsoft dropped the ball on the Xbox One and so there's just less people interested in Microsoft exclusives.\n\nSadly, Halo is also suffering the same problems today. Much the same problems also. Halo Infinite campaign is so bland I don't know if I can keep listening to the monkey make a speech for the 100th time. Ah guess what Halo got though! oPeN wOrLd gAmEpLaY\n\n### Comment ID icgvbi8 with +6 score by [(TierceK, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/icgvbi8/) (in reply to ID icgbg8d):\nInteresting post.\n\nDisagree about campaign, although agree about Del not being utilized enough and some more set pieces would be cool.\n\nStrongly disagree about gameplay. The chain melees, pulling someone over cover, new weapons, improved sprinting or rowdy-run, playable jack, classes, and escape all are new additions which still fit the Gears feeling.

Even a fairly well-supported game like Gears 5 is naturally gonna peter off after a while\n\n* I don't want to say it's 'outdated' or anything, but... most of the gaming world has kind of moved on from the third person cover shooter. Gears is the only one left, really. It was a huge trend back then but it's just not that popular anymore. The gameplay doesn't really have the same kind of infinitely replayable appeal as something like Fortnite or Destiny.\n\n* On a related note, one could argue that the gaming mainstream is kind of 'over' Gears in general - it was hot shit in the late noughties, but the hype's fizzled out a bit as tastes and trends have evolved. Gears 4 and 5 were well received, but I don't think they were really bringing in newer crowds\n\n* Too much competition - there are tons of online multiplayer games being released and updated all the time, all fighting for your attention. Back in the Gears 1-3 days there wasn't nearly as much, online console gaming was still in its early years and was still very novel. You had a lot of copycats but Gears was up there and arguably instrumental in the dominance of the 360 at the time. It's not really the case anymore.

That mad the fan base very first hard and loyal and I think when gears 5 came out everything from dropping “of war” and making things pay to play instead of being able to grind for everything just felt like they sold out to try to appeal to groups that never cared anyways.

Then they released Judgement which was utter ass and kind of killed the franchise for a hot second. Gears 4 came, as did 5 and I agree with other posters, the core gameplay hasn’t really changed and it’s largely the same bumper jumper gnasher gameplay. Gears is a weird game where it’s kind of locked into its gameplay. Everything is very locked in and constrained. You need to use cover, you need a gnasher, and there’s no way of changing without killing the franchise. I’m not a fan of spin-offs, but they just did one with Gears Tactics which was cool. They need some more content since Gears is beloved by a lot of the Xbox community. In Gears 6 I wish there was more weapons, more customization, more classes, better rank up system, more factions, better movement that’s more fluid, different story, etc. They better not make a Battle Royale because that would be a Longshot fuckfest from across the entire map.\n\n#### Comment ID geyewl6 with +2 score by [(AragornsMassiveCock, Reddit, 2020-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/k8giew/gears_franchise_is_underrated/geyewl6/) (in reply to ID gey7j35):\n*More* classes?

The campaign's are great but they shoehorn microtransactions and silly season pass cosmetics in. Like, why rebrand it as 'Gears' instead of Gears of War? It's silly things like that which just make no sense. I don't even think *they* know what they want from that game anymore. \n\nThe movie crossovers and wrestling characters jammed in are also mega-cringey. They spend the better part of a decade building a franchise that has an immersive universe, fantastic maps which create atmosphere, only to dilute it with Terminator and Batista. \n\nHalf the good game modes are gone, Wingman has been requested for over a year now and it's not been added. Their rationale is it was barely played, but then they have a 2 v 2 gnashed gamemode?

B) Gears already has such a long narrative, that all the fans have played and conquered, that you would have to develop an entirely new story. \n\nVideo games are already an interactive narrative. Unlike comics, you already have voices, live action, and the \"that's not the decision I made\" factor. So it would have to be brand new and insanely over the top.

Past challenges have been more attainable, and while more difficult for newer players, still allowed the opportunity to achieve if their skills developed. \n\nUnless you're already Re-Up 8, it is likely going to be impossible to complete these challenges while taking care of your family, career, and other responsibilities.\n\n### Comment ID eiwec0x with +3 score by [(TurianGhost, Reddit, 2019-03-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/b315v7/gears_of_war_4_gilded_raam_challenge/eiwec0x/) (in reply to ID eiwdozj):\nBeating the campaign on hardcore CO-OP is fairly easy. So RAAM is not that hard to get. But Re-up 10 does take a long time. Good thing is that new players have like 80 days to get it done before Gears 5\n\n#### Comment ID eiwezur with +3 score by [(cmchaunce, Reddit, 2019-03-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/b315v7/gears_of_war_4_gilded_raam_challenge/eiwezur/) (in reply to ID eiwec0x):\nI thought it said that all challenges must be completed within 80 days, but I could be wrong.\n\n#### Comment ID eiwlf8s with +3 score by [(SightlessKombat, Reddit, 2019-03-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/b315v7/gears_of_war_4_gilded_raam_challenge/eiwlf8s/) (in reply to ID eiwec0x):\nThe co-op campaign will be tough, I know I have a couple of players who might be willing to assist but I want to get that done as I can grind away at Horde myself in part but really want to get this character.\n\n#### Comment ID eiwf32n with +2 score by [(cmchaunce, Reddit, 2019-03-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/b315v7/gears_of_war_4_gilded_raam_challenge/eiwf32n/) (in reply to ID eiwec0x):\nJust checked, and it's 80 days.\n\n## Comment ID ek6fm29 with +1 score by [(DerekYourKing, Reddit, 2019-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/b315v7/gears_of_war_4_gilded_raam_challenge/ek6fm29/) (in reply to ID b315v7):\nI have completed the entire campaign in coop on hardcore, both my friend and I were playing on hardcore, he got the achievement but I did not, I double checked and it says I have 24 chapters completed in hardcore coop in the war journal, also when I go to the campaign it says highest difficulty completed in coop for each chapter is hardcore, why have I not gotten the achievement?\n\n### Comment ID ek6uz5j with +1 score by [(TurianGhost, Reddit, 2019-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/b315v7/gears_of_war_4_gilded_raam_challenge/ek6uz5j/) (in reply to ID ek6fm29):\nGlitches have plagued this game since launch.

But then again the whole narrative these same people are pushing is all about trying to attack any little thing they can.\n\nThe franchise is and always will be \"Gears of War\". The games are named differently so they can allow for spin-offs, like Gears Pop! and Gears Tactics. When Gears 4 was announced it was announced as \"Gears 4\". Everybody, both in text and in spoken word, says \"Gears\". It really is just that insignificant of a point to try and attack."

      "# [Soapbox: Gears Of War E-Day Could Be Something Special, If The Coalition Gets It Right by Ben Kerry, Pure Xbox on 2024-09-23](https://www.purexbox.com/features/soapbox-gears-of-war-e-day-could-be-something-special-if-the-coalition-gets-it-right)\nDuring Xbox's big summer showcase, the team announced a brand new Gears game in the form of Gears of War: E-Day - a good five years on from Gears 5 hitting Xbox One. More than anything, E-Day's reveal felt like a relief - we finally knew about the next Gears of War title after The Coalition had gone dark for longer than anticipated. For me personally though, the team's decision to revisit an earlier time period in Gears is so, so welcome, and I really do think this could be something very special for Xbox.\n\nLet's be clear to start with, The Coalition really hasn't made a bad game yet. Gears of War 4 and 5 are great Xbox titles, and even smaller projects like Gears: Ultimate Edition and the team's work on The Matrix Awakens have been successful endeavours as well. However, to me at least, this time period in the Gears universe feels ripe for exploring - and something about E-Day just feels very Gears so far.\n\nThe scary nature of the Locust emerging from the depths below — and everything that happened between then and the start of Gears 1 — should make E-Day fit right alongside Epic's original trilogy; which for me, was the highlight of the series so far. Gritty, intimate battles as humanity gets to grips with what the heck is going on with the Locust - that's Gears, and I can't wait to revisit that feeling in E-Day.\n\nThen, we're going to spend even more time with some the franchise's most beloved characters, which is also super exciting to me. E-Day's initial trailer puts plenty of focus on Marcus and Dom — Gears of War's OG dudebros — and you know what, I'll be more than happy to spend lots of time with them again. Truth be told, these two only look like dudebros - the original Gears cast has tons of personality and I felt they unfairly written off at times back in the mid-to-late 2000s.\n\nIn the gameplay department, we really don't have anything to worry about, do we? Gears 5 is phenomenal to play, especially at 120FPS on Xbox Series X|S. The Coalition's take on Gears, married with original, battle-worn gear and gadgets from the early days of the Locust war could make for an awesome pairing - especially if the team channels more of what made its Hivebusters DLC so great back in 2020. Less robot tech, more thrown-together monster gear, eh team?\n\nSo, yep, everything is laid out for The Coalition to deliver big with Gears of War: E-Day, and ever since its reveal trailer back in June, it's easily been my most anticipated Xbox title. If the developer can take everything it's learnt from working on Gears so far, and combine it with a bit more of that old school Gears identity, this upcoming release could be something very special. Whether it arrives next year as rumoured, or sometime after that, you can bet your bottom dollar I'll be there on day one - and I'll be here to tell you lot whether The Coalition has delivered the goods.\n\nIs this up there with your most-anticipated Xbox titles? Give us your opinions on this new direction for Gears down below.",

      "# [Gears of War: E-Day is rewinding the clocks, but The Coalition hints it still has eyes on Gears 6: \"We're not retreating from that storyline in any way\" by Kaan Serin on 2024-06-09](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/gears-of-war/gears-of-war-e-day-is-rewinding-the-clocks-but-the-coalition-hints-it-still-has-eyes-on-gears-6-were-not-retreating-from-that-storyline-in-any-way/)\nFans of oversized soldiers and chainsaw-guns might be surprised to hear that Gears of War: E-Day, the iconic series' next outing, isn't continuing the story leftover from the previous two games. But don't worry, developer The Coalition has no plans to simply abandon Kait Diaz and Co.\n\nRather than serving as a Gears of War 6, Gears of War: E-Day is throwing it back to Emergence Day - the day when the subterranean Locust army popped out of the ground and invaded Sera 14 years before the events of 2006's first Gears of War game - with Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago returning to the spotlight.\n\nWhile that's an exciting concept in isolation, it also means the narrative that started in Gears 4 and Gears 5 will remain unfinished for a while longer. If you're anything like me, you're probably itching to get back to Gears 5's agonizing cliffhanger and main gal Kait Diaz - and it now sounds like we'll get that resolution... at some point.\n\n\"We're super proud about Gears 4 and Gears 5 and the stories that were told,\" series brand director Nicole Fawcette tells Xbox Wire. The Coalition is supposedly \"not retreating from that storyline in any way,\" but the opportunity to fill in some Gears Gaps was \"too good to miss.\"\n\nThankfully, despite descending down the prequel hole, the studio is still evolving the almost 20-year-old series in fresh ways. For example, the Locust are more \"mysterious, formidable and overwhelming\" this time around. The trailer has a younger Marcus struggling to defend himself against one of the uglies - a stark contrast to the way he mows 'em down in later games. But we'll need to wait until Gears of War: E-Day launches on Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Game Pass to get the full picture.",

Despite speculation, it's not Gears 6. Instead, The Coalition is working on Gears of War: E-Day, a prequel focused on the most infamous event in all of Gears of War's bloody history. You can check out the announcement trailer below:\n\nThis trailer was built entirely in-engine, with The Coalition taking full advantage of Unreal Engine 5 to push what's visually possible. There's no release date or release window right now, or even any mention of platforms, but as it's an Xbox first-party game, we can of course expect Gears of War: E-Day to launch day one on Xbox Game Pass.\n\nGears of War: E-Day is a prequel, but the story will continue further\n\nSharing more on Xbox Wire, The Coalition confirms that this isn't some small spin-off, it's the next mainline game. Even so, that doesn't mean the team is moving away from the current-day Gears story, which was most recently touched on with the 2019 title Gears 5.\n\n“We realized that a lot of the words we use to describe the franchise were what our fans also use, phrases like brotherhood, brutality, pathos, awe” says creative director Matt Searcy. “Why E-Day? That’s the moment it all comes together. It’s the heart of the Gears universe. Everything that happens is shaped by this day.”\n\n“We’re super proud about Gears 4 and Gears 5 and the stories that were told,” says brand director Fawcette. “We’re not retreating from that storyline in any way. But in [this] moment, we had an opportunity to write our next step, and this one just felt too good to miss.”\n\nAnalysis: There's something in my eye\n\nThere's a handful of franchises you grow up with, games that mean something truly special to you because of the time and manner in which you experienced them. Gears of War is one such franchise for me. This trailer was absolutely stellar, and I'm thrilled The Coalition is going to be exploring Emergence Day in the next mainline Gears of War title.\n\nI'm also happy the team isn't abandoning the story that is waiting past Gears 5. I loved that game, and I want to see where Kait's narrative is leading her. But I'm more than happy that we are going to be taking a detour along the way.",

      "# [Day Announcement! on 2024-06-18](https://gamrconnect.vgchartz.com/thread/248243/gears-of-war-e-day-announcement/)\nAs to no Suprise but also a Suprise, Microsoft showed off the return of Gears of War, but this time it hit a little differently. This isn't Gears 6 but a prequel which hit a lot of soft spots for gaming veterans. If you haven't seen the trailer, check it out below and let's digress.\n\nGears of War: E-Day | Official Announce Trailer (In-Engine) - Xbox Games Showcase 2024 (youtube.com)\n\nSo those familiar with the trailer, they would have noticed that's the Mad World theme from the original Gears of War trailer back in 2006. Yes, we are old. Also seeing the original cast of young Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago. This Trailer is based during E-Day (Emergence Day) a prequel to Gears 1 which will explain and show how the Locust invaded and almost conquered Sera. It's a very interesting time slot to make a Gears game and one to be excited for.\n\nDuring the release of Halo 3, I had a choice between buying a PS3 and a 360, and what pushed me on getting the 360 was for Halo 3 + BC with previous titles and Rare games, since I grew up with Rare and loved their games. After buying a 360 my friend told me about the Gears of War games and recommended trying them out. Halo was the Right hand of Xbox and Gears of War was the Left hand of Xbox. At first, I saw the Gears of War games as your typical dude bro shooter which didn't interest me at first and I had a choice in buying the Mass Effect games or the Gears of War games which 3 was soon to release. I bit the bullet and said I'll try the Gears games, but I needed to play them from start to finish, meaning i brought GeoW3 but wouldn't play it until completed GeoW 1 and GeoW 2 first. Yes, I did that and finished them all in the correct order.\n\nMy thoughts on the series changed drastically. Gears of War looked like the typical dude bro from the artwork and covers but deep down, it's a Series that offers an amazing story, has some of the most emotional moments during its era and offering Gameplay and visuals which were best in class and the series still continues to this very day. Gears of War is much more than just muscles and explosions, it's a series that is about War, Death and Sadness, and it's awesome.\n\nThe Coalition has stated on Twitter/X that E-Day will be going back to the roots of the series, focusing on being a Linear style horror game like its predecessors and as a Gears of War fan who has finished all Gears games in the series, including 1, 2, 3, Judgment, Tactics, 4, 5 and played Gears PoP lol that's extremely exciting news.\n\nGears of War, the sleeping giant has awoken, the granddaddy and king of cover-based shooters, who's excited? what are your expectations or concerns.\n\nLast edited by Azzanation - on 18 June 2024",

      "# [Gears of War: E-Day revealed in Xbox Showcase at Summer Game Fest by Maddy Myers on 2024-06-09](https://www.polygon.com/24172746/gears-of-war-e-day-xbox-showcase-summer-game-fest-marcus-fenix)\nIt’s been five years since Gears 5, the most recent mainline Gears of War game, and a lot of fans had been straight-up wondering if there was ever even going to be another Gears of War game. The Coalition, the Xbox Game Studios developer that makes Gears of War games, finally revealed a new game in the series called Gears of War: E-Day.\n\nThe moody cinematic trailer, which even includes a brief clip of Gary Jules’ “Mad World” cover that appeared in an old, iconic trailer for the first Gears of War, depicts two Gears soldiers fighting Locust enemies. It looks like this game’s story will be a prequel to the first Gears of War game, as one of the two Gears is wearing Marcus Fenix’s headwrap and looks like he’s a young version of the famous character who starred in the original trilogy of Gears of War games (and still appears as an older advisory character in the latter-day Gears games). The other Gears soldier appears to be a young version of Dom, Marcus’ BFF from the original games. The game’s “E-Day” title, which refers to the original day that the Locust showed up, further cements the prequel idea and tells us exactly when this game is happening.\n\nThe first three Gears of War games, all made by Epic Games, were an exclusive staple of the Xbox lineup in the late 2000s and 2010s. The games popularized the cover shooter genre as well as “horde mode,” a survival mode in which players face endless waves of enemies and try to stay alive as long as they can. Gears games weren’t the first to do either of these types of gameplay, but they are still perhaps the most popular examples of both. After the release of the initial trilogy, though, a few things changed. The games’ lead designer Cliff Bleszinski left Epic Games in 2012, and in 2014, the Gears of War license was acquired by Xbox Game Studios.\n\nMost fans (including this author) agree that the very first Gears game post-acquisition, Gears of War 4, was a rocky transition and didn’t “feel” quite like a Gears game, tone-wise. Gears 5 managed to recapture a lot of the magic of the originals while also introducing some new stuff (like open world sections, which are weird for a Gears game but not un-fun). It’s very interesting to see the Coalition returning to E-Day and clearly trying to evoke the feel and the look of the original Gears of War trilogy.\n\nAs for how the Coalition has spent its time since developing Gears 5, it definitely wasn’t just an immediate dive into Gears of War: E-Day. Instead, the studio made Gears Tactics (2020), a turn-based strategy game set in the Gears universe; and The Coalition was also tapped to help in the development of Halo Infinite. If there were ever going to be an announcement of a Gears of War game in 2024, fans would have expected it to be Gears 6, a straight-up sequel to Gears 5, so this announcement comes as a surprise all around.",

      "# [Cliff Bleszinski: Gears of War Needs a Reboot by Samuel Rivera on 2023-11-08](https://neverendingrealm.com/news/cliff-bleszinski-gears-of-war-needs-a-reboot/)\nCliff Bleszinski, the creator and director of the original Gears of War trilogy said, in a recent interview with Comic Book , that Gears of War as a franchise needs a reboot along the lines of God of War (2018).\n\nIn reality, Gears of War under the Coalition, has been much more successful in terms of quality, than Halo under 343 industries, but the series has certainly lost some of its appeal over the last decade.\n\nBleszinski Willing to Help\n\nOn how Cliff would help the franchise:\n\n“I believe Gears needs a little bit of a reboot, like God of War had, and I’ve always said, Phil Spencer has my number, I’m happy to consult. Gears will always be near and dear to my heart. Late afternoon, if I have a mimosa in me, sometimes I’ll go to YouTube and I’ll look up key cut scenes from the Gears franchise, like Dom’s death, or Dom having to put down his wife, and I read the comments.”\n\nGears of War was single-handedly the reason why got an Xbox 360 over a PlayStation 3 at the start of the Xbox 360/PS3 era. The game was a visual revelation, a true next generation game for the time, and it made the PS3’s Resistance look like dog crap on a cardboard. Gears of War was also revolutionary the way that it told its sci-fir war tale. Character chatter during missions was wildly entertaining, and the game was cinematic enough to hook players up beyond the glorious visuals, and gory presentation.\n\nBeyond the stated above, the game took Resident Evil 4’s over the shoulder view, and gave it a much faster, much more dynamic feel, in a game that relied heavy on coverage. Taking coverage, and popping up to shoot at strategic moments during the game’s massive gun fights was fun, and somewhat innovative in the late 2000s.\n\nWhy Gears Lost Some of its Flair?\n\nPart of the problem for this saga, is that the original four man team was a golden success. Marcus Fenix was the ultimate hard bad man, and Dom was his perfect companion. The newer, younger cast, seemed forced, and not as ‘hardened’ as the older cast. A reboot would help in this area, as the original trilogy had the more engaging plot line.\n\nWhile Gears of War used to be the king of visuals, Naughty Dog’s efforts consistently beat The Coalition’s efforts with this series during the PlayStation 4/Xbox 360 era. Eventually, at least to me, Gears wasn’t a much of a system seller, in contrast to some of Sony’s best first party titles.\n\nGears of War Might Be Microsoft’s Best Action Franchise\n\nYes, it has been consistently better than Halo, at least since Bungie left the property to 343 Industries. Given that statement it is likely that Microsoft doesn’t share the same sentiment of Bleszinski. Personally, I would love another Gears of War with a sole focus on Marcus Fenix, but given that the next Gears entry is bound to be a showcase for the Unreal 5 engine, I expected another game that wow’s visually, at the very least.\n\nTo be fair, Gears 5 wasn’t that bad, storytelling wise, perhaps The Coalition can right the ship without the need of a reboot.",

      "# [Why I'm Conflicted About Gears of War: E by Sam Martinelli on 2024-07-15](https://punishedbacklog.com/punished-notes-gears-hellblade/)\nWelcome back to Punished Notes! For this latest edition, volume 34, I discuss some of my feelings around the new Gears of War announcement, the one game that uses photorealistic graphics in creative ways, and, for some reason, Mean Girls. Also… plenty more in the lightning round!\n\nI’m Conflicted About Gears of War: E-Day\n\nFairly or unfairly, I’ve garnered a reputation among some of my friends and fellow Punished Backlog writers as somewhat of an Xbox apologist. I don’t think every single Xbox console is the greatest thing since sliced bread—and I certainly can’t defend many of Microsoft’s indefensible and baffling actions—but I do generally enjoy Xbox’s first-party output more than most, even going so far as to largely favor it over PlayStation’s fake blockbuster approach.\n\nNowhere does this supposed apologia rear its head the most than in my staunch defense of 2019’s Gears 5, the fifth mainline entry in Xbox’s juggernaut Gears of War franchise. Unlike its predecessor, Gears of War 4, Gears 5 reinvigorated my love for the series, zeroing in on the slow-but-heavy action that defined its forefathers while adding in enough of its own flavor to stand out.\n\nMost importantly, I fell in love with Kait Diaz, the game’s post-Act I protagonist, and her journey to learn more about the source of the deadly Swarm enemies, as well as her own family’s grisly past. Gears 5 felt fresh in so many ways, and I’ve been waiting five years for developer The Coalition to give me the next chapter in Kait’s story. So, when Microsoft closed its 2024 Xbox Games Showcase with a reveal trailer for Gears of War: E-Day, a prequel to the first game in the series, let’s just say I had a fairly mixed reaction.\n\nLet’s first consider the positives. I love the idea of playing as a young Marcus Fenix (the protagonist of the first three games) learning to grapple with the first days of the invasion of the Locust (alien bug people that live beneath the planet’s surface). Fenix and his squadmates are grizzled, veteran badasses at the start of the first Gears of War, so seeing these men face a horrifying, unimaginable new threat appeals to the fan in me.\n\nMeanwhile, the folks over at The Coalition seem to appreciate what made the original games so successful in the first place, and are seeking to reinvigorate the franchise’s fanbase by boiling everything down to the fundamentals.\n\n“We realized that a lot of the words we use to describe the franchise were what our fans also use, phrases like brotherhood, brutality, pathos, awe,” said creative director Matt Searcy in an interview with Xbox Wire. “Why E-Day? That’s the moment it all comes together. It’s the heart of the Gears universe. Everything that happens is shaped by this day.” What Gears lover wouldn’t want that?\n\nMy concerns, however, are twofold. First of all, I thoroughly enjoyed the ways Gears 5 pushed the franchise to new narrative realms without completely abandoning what made people fall in love in the first place. The series’ transition away from the Fenix family toward Kait Diaz, a Latina woman with familial ties to Locust Queen Myrrah, allowed the player to finally inhabit someone other than a grotesquely muscular white guy.\n\nDiaz’s character arc (which, if I’m being honest, was a little messy) got to exist outside of the typical “traumatized war hero” archetype that has plagued video games for decades, and as a result the structure of the campaign got to explore various themes only hinted at but not fully explored in previous entries: the individual vs. the collective, what it means to fight on behalf of the lesser evil, whether survival means anything after so much loss, and whether one can truly distance themselves from their familial past. Delaying a follow-up to Gears 5 means avoiding a satisfying conclusion to Kait’s story for even longer.\n\nSecondly, while I understand the “back to basics” approach a lot of companies take when rebooting or returning to a familiar IP, such a decision could potentially pull the series backward. Instead of trying to build upon what came before, The Coalition seems to be retreating to the franchise’s comfort zone. I love the original Gears of War trilogy as much as anyone, but I can always go back and play those old games; I was ready to move on after 2011, and I remain ready to see what else the world of Sera has in store. You can’t grow an IP by just doing the same thing over and over again.\n\nI know I’ll play (and probably enjoy) E-Day when it comes out, whenever that is. The Coalition will probably nail the gameplay mechanics and present a compelling story with a nice balance of new ideas and fan service moments. Most Gears enthusiasts will likely fall in love with the characters and locales all over again. I just think Kait Diaz deserves more, and so do we.\n\nHellblade II and Making Better Graphics Actually Matter\n\nWhile I continue to be impressed by the gradual improvement of ultra-realism in video game visuals over the years, such improvements are rarely that massive (or even particularly noticeable to the naked eye) anymore. Even when such strides in visual technology do stick out, I no longer feel quite as amazed by them as I used to. Moreover, I yearn for times in gaming when such limitations in graphical fidelity inspired developers to try more visually creative routes, such as Dishonored’s jagged comic-book feel or the insane body proportions of the characters in Gears of War.\n\nSenua’s Saga: Hellblade II, Ninja Theory’s latest epic Norse tale, offers particularly noticeable leaps with its presentation, and it’s genuinely incredible from a technical standpoint, both visually and sonically (seriously, the audio effects in this game are outstanding). Unlike most other AAA titles with similarly impressive graphics, however, Hellblade II goes a step further, utilizing such advancements to enhance the game’s narrative elements.\n\nA sequel to 2017’s Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice, Hellblade II continues the story of Senua, a Pict warrior from Orkney in the early ninth century who allows herself to be captured by Northmen slavers and taken to Iceland in an attempt to free her enslaved people. The titular hero must navigate through a bevy of trying obstacles, battling giants and draugar (evil baddies from Norse folklore) left and right while braving her way through the elements just to survive.\n\nThose familiar with the first game understand a notable twist: Senua has psychosis (characterized as her “curse”), meaning she constantly hears competing voices only in her head, and it’s difficult for her to discern whether every horror she sees is real or imagined.\n\nI can’t speak to the accuracy of either Hellblade title’s depiction of this kind of mental illness—there has been some debate over this, after all—but the way Senua’s Saga plays with such hallucinations makes the more realistic graphics truly essential to the overall experience. The player can easily identify grass, rocks, water, and trees, but the monsters and glowing orbs seem just as natural. Sword fights with the draugar only appear marginally different than similar skirmishes with humans, especially in the dark. If everything looks equally real to the player, shouldn’t it be the same for Senua?\n\nThe game expertly presents phenomena that seem fantastical and outlandish while providing cogent explanations for why people might find them real (e.g., religious fanaticism, misinterpreting natural disasters, the fog of war). So when Senua, struggling as she always has to maintain a grip on her own sanity, witnesses a giant emerging from lava, of course she would think it’s actually happening, since others around her also believe such a thing is possible. As a result, the player can’t always be sure how much of the game is real or fantasy. For once, having everything look nearly real actually made me question how much a video game character’s own personal experience was fantasy.\n\nFor the most part, I still vastly prefer a diversity of art direction among AAA games over what we’re currently seeing, where a lot of games are starting to look more and more alike. But if other studios took the same approach that Ninja Theory just did, I’d understand it and possibly even encourage it. (Probably not, though, since such slavish devotion to graphical fidelity is probably harming the industry at large more than most realize.)\n\nLIGHTNING ROUND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nAnother quick note on Hellblade II: The game’s simplistic, 1-vs-1 approach to combat works greatly to its benefit. Some of the fights in the first Hellblade, particularly ones where you had to battle multiple opponents at once, were too chaotic and frustrating, whereas basically every encounter in the sequel feels relatively smooth and exciting.\n\nI’m still chugging along with Dragon Quest VIII, and the funny thing about this game is that I would argue that while it “gets good” about 25 hours in (especially after a particular story twist occurs), the prior 25 hours are still… quite good. It may seem bizarre to praise anything that takes so long to feel worth it, but for some reason I don’t think such a view detracts from the previous 25 hours at all. The game is fantastic in its entirety, but I’m especially glad it manages to have new gears it can reach that far into the experience.\n\nThe best part of last month’s Nintendo Direct wasn’t any single announcement (though, to be clear, I am extremely hyped for games like The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond). Instead, the presentation’s greatest aspect was that it got people excited once again about a console that’s over seven years old. Basically everyone I knew saw at least one game—or even two or three—during that Direct that they can’t wait to play, and that’s not something I can say about any other Nintendo platform that late in its lifespan.",
      "# [New Gears of War game will be somber, linear and very detailed by Stephen Totilo on 2024-06-10](https://www.gamefile.news/p/new-gears-of-war-game-will-be-somber)\nAn iconic commercial for 2006’s Gears of War is heavily influencing the direction of Microsoft’s newly revealed surprise video game prequel Gears of War: E-Day.\n\nThat ad paired footage of the dark, gritty Xbox 360 sci-fi combat game with a sorrowful cover of Tears for Fears’ “Mad World.” That combo, unusual for game trailers that tended to be more upbeat and aggressive, moved players at the time. The commercial became a classic example of so-called “sadvertising.”\n\nThe ad was, arguably, more somber than anything in the actual Gears of War game, though franchise sequels have had enough desperate firefights and shocking deaths that it’s become a Gears brand identity.\n\nGears franchise director Nicole Fawcette reinforced that in a behind-closed-doors group interview I attended in LA on Sunday afternoon.\n\nShe shared what Gears development studio The Coalition says fans have communicated as the core elements of the series:\n\n“The brutality of Gears”\n\n“The sadness, kind of melancholy vibe”\n\n“It wouldn’t be Gears if it wasn’t over the top, kind of an action spectacle”\n\n“Never fight alone” – a vibe born from the series’ co-op modes (It is also a slogan The Coalition uses in conjunction with an ongoing pledge to donate 1% of franchise revenue to organizations that work on suicide prevention and loneliness)\n\nAnd what of the new game itself, a new adventure set in the city of Kalona?

      "# [Gears Of War E-Day May Be A Prequel, But The Coalition Hasn't Forgot About Gears 6 by Johnny Flores Jr on 2024-06-10](https://www.thegamer.com/gears-of-war-e-day-may-be-a-prequel-but-the-coalition-hasnt-forgot-about-gears-6/)\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe Gears of War franchise is back with a new title called Gears of War: E-Day.\n\nE-Day will serve as a prequel set during the events of Emergence Day, and it will follow a young Marcus and Dom.\n\nThe Coalition has not forgotten about the cliffhanger ending in Gears 5, though the studio felt E-Day was too important of a story to pass up.\n\nIt's been a while since Gears of War fans had anything to look forward to. After all, the last mainline Gears game was released in 2019, and the last game of any kind was Gears Tactics, as well as support for the now-discontinued Gears Pop! -- a mobile game mashup between Funko Pop! and Gears of War. That all changed on Sunday, when, at the end of the Xbox Games Showcase, the next Gears of War title was revealed.\n\nOfficially titled Gears of War: E-Day, the latest entry in the shooter franchise is a prequel set years before the events of the first game. E-Day takes place during Emergence Day, aka the event that set the series in motion, when the Locust descended on Sera.\n\nIt is arguably the franchise's most important event, though it's never been explored outside of conversations and in-game lore. E-Day will change that by allowing players to see the events through the perspective of a young Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago.\n\nIt's certainly a change of pace for the series, but longtime fans of the series were a tad bit confused about its place in the larger franchise. That's because the last mainline title, Gears 5, ended on a massive cliffhanger that would seemingly lead into Gears 6. Of course, E-Day is not Gears 6, and with no concrete release date for it, then it would appear that Gears 6 might be even further off. But The Coalition, the team behind the current titles, hasn't forgotten about where it left off.\n\nThe Coalition Is 'Not Retreating' From The Main Storyline\n\nIn a tell-all post on Xbox Wire, creative director Matt Searcy and brand director Nicole Fawcette discussed the decision to go back in time after Gears 5. Per the post, The Coalition is proud of its work on Gears of War 4 and Gears 5 and will not be abandoning the overarching storyline it established.\n\n“We’re super proud about Gears 4 and Gears 5 and the stories that were told,” Fawcette said. “We’re not retreating from that storyline in any way. But in [this] moment, we had an opportunity to write our next step, and this one just felt too good to miss.” That next step being the story of how it all began, which, according to The Coalition, is too pivotal to not tell.\n\nIn that vein, E-Day is not a spin-off, like Gears of War: Judgment. Instead, it's a mainline tale, and per Xbox Wire, \"the events of the game not only serve as an exciting origin tale of two beloved characters, but it also adds detail and context to this period that will resonate through stories that will follow.\"\n\nElsewhere, it was revealed that E-Day is not just an origin for Marcus and Dom, but for all of Gears. An example given is the famous Chainsaw Lancer, which coincidentally doesn't exist during E-Day. That is one of the stories that will be told. “[The Chainsaw Lancer] doesn’t currently exist in that period… but it’s not a Gears game if you’re not chainsawing Locusts,\" Fawcette explained.\n\nSo, while this isn't directly Gears 6, it seems like The Coalition has good reason to stray from its cliffhanger in Gears 5. Whatever is told in E-Day will seemingly impact all future entries. And, at the very least, there's confirmation that Gears 6 will be a thing at some point, even if fans have to wait a while.",

The Coalition talked about it in a recent interview.\n\nThe Coalition and Microsoft debuted a stunning trailer for E-Day during last week's Xbox Showcase. Yes, it turned out that this trailer wasn't in real-time, but it has many excited nonetheless. Since the release of the trailer, fans have been wondering whether E-Day will also include Gears' iconic multiplayer mode. In a new interview with WindowsCentral, Creative Director Matt Searcy briefly touched on the subject, and while he didn't directly confirm multiplayer, he did provide some hints.\n\n\"I would say, this is the next mainline Gears game,\" the Creative Director said when asked about multiplayer, \"Gears has a pretty clear DNA for gameplay modes, so you can probably anticipate where we'll be going with E-Day.\"\n\nBased on this reply, it's pretty likely that E-Day will offer a fan-favorite multiplayer mode.\n\nInterestingly enough, further in the interview, Searcy and Brand Director Nicole Fawcette also mentioned the story arcs of Gears 4 and Gears 5. After all, many Gears fans expected The Coalition to announce Gears 6 after the events of Gears 5. This, however, didn't happen and the team announced a prequel. Luckily for some, The Coalition isn't deserting the story of Gears 4 and 5, as emphasized by Fawcette.\n\n\"We're focused on this and pouring everything we can into it right now, what the next game is will be for us to decide in the future,\" Searcy said. Fawcette added, \"We're not retreating from the stories of Gears 4 and 5, though. We just spent time thinking about the stories we want to tell, and we can flex the franchise from both sides. We're excited about telling this story, and hopefully, fans will love this story too.\"\n\nGears of War: E-Day is coming to Xbox and PC on a yet-to-be-announced date."
