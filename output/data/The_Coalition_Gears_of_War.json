The only logical reasoning for majority of the posts I saw was, \"gears was released every 2 years, it's been 4 since gears 5\".\n\nI do not by any means consider myself an industry insider, so take what I have to say with a grain of salt, but I do try to reference as many sources as I can. I'm just been a life long gears fan, who reads gears news. \n\nI really hate to be the bearer of bad news, if we get a \"gears reveal\" it's not coming this year. \nStarfield is the game Microsoft is pushing this holiday season. \n\nhttps://gamerant.com/gears-war-3-delayed-microsoft-big-holiday-title\n\nIf we get shown gears, it's not coming until next Christmas at the earliest. \n\nThe Coalition has stated they are working on a new ip as well as \"the future of gears\" \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/teu8oc/rip_gears_esports_tc_working_on_the_future_of/\n\nIf it wasn't gears 6, I saw \"we are getting\" \"The Marcus Collection\" (we will probably never get) that would divide the studio between more projects. I would love to see Judgement on the proper gow3 control scheme. It probably won't happen though. \nJust for reference from the time TC was formed to the time Gears of war ultimate edition was released was about a year.\n\nLast may (about a year ago) TC announced all future projects will be developed with unreal engine 5. \nhttps://www.thecoalitionstudio.com/the-future-of-gears-5/\n\nWould you really want them to push out of 3-4 fully Remastered games in a brand new engine in about a year when the last one took them about a year to do? \n\nUpdate Gears of war a retrospective author talks about how \"a collection if it's coming is still a long way off\" \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/143fg49/gears_collection_and_ue_5_from_supervising_editor/\n\nI could be completely wrong on all of this and a part of me hopes that I am. I would really set that expectation bar low for gears at the showcase. Fable was also shown at a previous show, this is also likely the game Microsoft pushes next year. \n\nI expect this to be not a popular opinion, and down voted heavily.\n\nAlso no gears movie or TV trailers.\n\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-promises-no-full-cg-trailers-for-xbox-showcase-first-party-games\n\n## Comment ID jm9ve2t with +14 score by [(BChaps, Reddit, 2023-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/13w5llv/we_are_getting_gears_of_war_6_at_the_xbox/jm9ve2t/) (in reply to ID 13w5llv):\nTC doesn't even really have a Community Director or CM at this point.

It’s really pointless to beg and cry over something that won’t happen. I don’t anticipate anything about Gears 6.

That is it.  We are certainly not getting a gears of war game within the next 2 years, and if we do it'll be another low effort GaaS game like Halo Infinite and Gears 5, built overtime. \n\nPeople forget switching over to a new engine is at the very least 6 months to a year of training to be efficient at it, they struggled with decent content on the old engine they knew about let alone a new one.  The studio was also newly formed and that takes time to become cohesive and like clock work, not only that, but then they've gone and switched over to a new engine pipeline, technology also rapidly changes over short amounts of time in this industry.\n\nSo, yeah its likely in development now, but I wouldn't expect much.  A teaser with the logo and some minor visuals (literally a flash of visuals) is all we are likely to get, if not this year, then certainly within the next 2 years.   Remember, Fable has been in development for years, and they've still not shown it, its not even certain it'll show up at this most recent event.\n\nExpecting gameplay or a release date of Gears 6 is rather unrealistic, at most I expect a flash of Gears 6's logo, to let everyone know its in development and coming to build hype, because Xbox has been in dire straights as of late, I was even amazed at Halo even likely getting some air time for Season 4 trailer during the event.\n\nWith how redfall, Halo and Gears 5 turned out (not to be commercial successes day one) I can see them teasing Gears 6, but its equally as unlikely.\n\n### Comment ID jmkvd55 with +1 score by [(IamMovieMiguel, Reddit, 2023-06-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/13w5llv/we_are_getting_gears_of_war_6_at_the_xbox/jmkvd55/) (in reply to ID jmgiuhm):\nThank you!

It seems to be an issue with the vast majority of horror franchises (in all media) in that the more you learn about the world/enemies/antagonist the less, well, scary it gets.\n\nGears 1 and 2 were gritty horror games because we (in-game characters and players) all were learning about the Locust and their capabilities in real-time. Everything after that can't have that same feel because there's nothing truly new to learn about the Locust/Swarm (For all its faults, credit to Gears 4 for at least trying with how it sent us into the hive of the Swarm).\n\nDon't get me wrong, I miss the vibe of Gears 1 and 2 too. I just don't know how The Coalition (or even Epic for that matter) can keep telling horror stories AND filling out the lore of the Locust. \n\nI fully agree on one thing though, at minimum we need blood and guts back when we chainsaw enemies! They're all rated M, so why hold back?!\n\n### Comment ID kbafzgf with +2 score by [(Fabulous_Comb1830, Reddit, 2023-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/186roqx/gears_of_war_creator_reminds_microsoft_you_have/kbafzgf/) (in reply to ID kba6rpj):\nOnly played the first one.

I think one major criticism of Gears5 is its storytelling choices. \n\n\nFor example, the protagonist in previous Gears is willing to risk his life to go into a locust territory to help his friend that will most likely get himself killed. That kind of supportive story is beautiful. And we have Gears5, there is almost no connection to the companion, it is as if the guy is just a robot or slave or unwanted tag along, just sad.

We have a mutual friend who introduced us. At that time, his studio closed and he was just not really into making games at that point. He didn’t even really want to play them. He ended up investing his money into his other passion: Broadway. \n\nHe loves musicals and threw money at Hadestown which did well from what I know. I’m not a Broadway guy but it seems popular enough for me to know about them. \n\nHe also owns a bar in the Carolinas where you can see him do some karaoke and some questionable stand up comedy. \n\nOther than that, we walked around a bunch and he was willing to take us out for drinks but I was incredibly tired. It was a long day of me gluing stuff to my wife’s cosplay as it fell off. \n\nEither way, we had a fine interaction. He is incredibly aware of how people view him and he’s made peace with it.

It's been mostly fixed, but these things hurt the game.\n\nThe story is... Not the best. The bland characters mean you don't really get invested. \n\nJD in Gears 4 is basically just \"the son of Marcus Pheonix\" with very little to actually like. In 5 he gets sidelined after being wreckless, but never really letting us see how it affected him. We just have him show up, scarred and sort of grown. Addressing very little of his character development. \n\nKait, is interesting... At least in terms of how people react to her. We're given a little about her throughout 4 with who she is in the grander story being more important than trying to let the player get to know her. With how the story starts some time has passed since 4 in the 5th installment. It's s implied that her connection to the Locusts/Swarm has been progressing. This is where a lot of people really get lost in weeds on liking her or not. Most dislike her because they think she's a whining crybaby. I'm not going to say they're wrong. But if most of these people were put through the wringer like she has, they'd likely act similarly. Though we're given very little to like beyond some small moments, so regardless of the \"whining\" being justified or not, there's very little to like. \n\nDel is great as a secondary character. He's the supportive friend that has some tech knowledge. In 4 he's meh, while in 5 he's actually a much stronger character throughout. He even manages to get a few chuckles out of me in some cutscenes. Along with actually trying to talk about problems with his friends. He's one of the better new characters, as controversial of an opinion as that might be to some people.\n\nFahz... Uh he's apparently kind of popular. I don't really get it. He's an A-hole who turns out to not be as much on A-hole as your initially led to believe. Which isn't terrible, but similar to Del he fills his role well enough.\n\nIt's really funny that I loved the characters in hivebusters. They were actually fun and we'll written, on top of giving us a varied but short campaign. I loved it in general over the main story and it proves the devs can make a fun but somewhat serious story. \n\nOn top of the characters the story was just so... Meh. 4 was literally just a story to justify sequels, and 5 for some reason felt the need to explain the origin of the Locusts. Which kind of did very little for the story, and offered minimal real payoff when you can predict it in the first hour or so. \n\nThen the open world. Which basically just replaced the vehicle/turret sections, and didn't add much. But was the biggest addition to the campaign. It was honestly kind of disappointing, and made things just feel slow.\n\nFinally. One of the biggest reasons Gears in general hasn't really taken off, is the multiplayer. When it's 90% people just bouncing around with shotguns, mostly getting one-shot. You're either on of the few people that likes it, or you can't get into the multiplayer pretty much at all. As satisfying as it is once you get the hang of it, it's not for everyone. \n\nWhich is why I'm surprised horde doesn't get more love. I get that escape was added too, but I feel like multiplayer PvE content is  much more palatable to the vast majority of gamers when it comes to Gears. Because the alternative is \"fixing\" PvP to be more appealing to general audiences. Which would kill the game for its fans. \n\nIt's sad to say, but as fun and exciting as the game can be. It's just not being handled correctly by Microsoft and The Coalition.\n\n### Comment ID ichayxc with +11 score by [(javycane, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/ichayxc/) (in reply to ID icgrf62):\nYour last sentence sums it up lol.\n\n### Comment ID iciqanm with +5 score by [(FelledWolf, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/iciqanm/) (in reply to ID icgrf62):\nTo tack onto this, gears horde used to be where I can load a map and have a chatoic session with no having to prepare cards and classes and gather power.. those mechanics are not fun for me.

I have tons of friends that love shooters but won’t touch gears. \n\nIt’s very punishing for beginner players and isn’t that intuitive when it comes to movement and gunplay. There are third person games like fortnite that have much more verticality and run and gun style movement with zero reliance on a cover system. There’s other third person cover shooters that are slower and more tactically paced. \n\nGears has a weird spot in the middle. Grounded gameplay with extremely twitchy run and cover gameplay. Watch an absolute sweat play the game, and it looks like they’re having a stroke between walls and one-shotting everyone.\n\nThe biggest gears fans are people that have been playing the game since forever ago.

Gears 4 was basically unplayable on PC unless you were using 2 year old graphics drivers.  The new series (imo) has a much less exciting campaign which doesn't draw in new players.  I can't convince my friends to play the series even though I'm absolutely in love with it because they have no way to play it on PC and none of us have picked up a controller in about a decade.  \n\nThey need to come out swinging with a collection of the first 3 games like MCC did.

I personally played a lot of Horde and enjoyed going through the campaign with a friend).\n\nRecent titles don't have the gore or intensity that contributed to the franchises unique atmosphere.\n\nOn top of all of this, while the original title(s) were huge in their own right, I don't know that they ever held the mass appeal of other major titles.\n\n### Comment ID icgpkw0 with +3 score by [(TierceK, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/icgpkw0/) (in reply to ID icgjvln):\nHm, lackluster is a pretty good term to describe the campaigns instead of bad which they are not.\n4 had a great prologue. Also the last act, but because of the Mech gameplay, not because of the story. \n5 had a pretty good story. More dramatic and mature. Act 2 and 3 were very intense, great story and world building.\n\n## Comment ID ichj7mi with +2 score by [(gorillasnthabarnyard, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/ichj7mi/) (in reply to ID vcttwn):\nCause gow1 still has the best online.\n\n## Comment ID ici39bw with +2 score by [(OrdinaryDouble2494, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/ici39bw/) (in reply to ID vcttwn):\nYeah, but then you remember the wallbouncing and all of that goes to the trash lmao\n\n## Comment ID icjcq1y with +2 score by [(zackfromspace, Reddit, 2022-06-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/icjcq1y/) (in reply to ID vcttwn):\nBecause it's absolutely doggy doo compared to the first 3.\n\n### Comment ID icn3khd with +1 score by [(Ihateazuremountain, Reddit, 2022-06-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/icn3khd/) (in reply to ID icjcq1y):\nthen why do the older games have less players lol\n\n#### Comment ID icsroa8 with +1 score by [(Hour_Toe_2253, Reddit, 2022-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/icsroa8/) (in reply to ID icn3khd):\nwow.\n\n## Comment ID icgbg8d with +7 score by [(KokakGamer, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/icgbg8d/) (in reply to ID vcttwn):\nIMO it's a variety of reasons. Some objective, some subjective.\n\nFirst off I think this series has plateud in quality. IMO the biggest drop in quality is the campaign. It's bland and forgettable. We have a whiny protag who gets pulled along and makes selfish decisions. Dom breaking Marcus out of prison already kinda attaches me to this chad who broke me out. Also, there is much less care put towards the gritty gore nature of combat. Cement chunks don't come off low walls, guts don't stay on the floor, you name it. Gritty, gore, and guts was what differentiated this game from CoD. You look at a bunch of games trailers and GoW 1-3 stood out because of that. And now it's just very bland generic looking less thick people shooting at each other. Wooptido. And guess what our next quest is? Is it a hammer of dawn related mission? Is grass green? The game gets rid of epic setpiece moments like riding a brumak or a whole campaign inside a worm in favor of open world. You get a discount black guy who might as well not exist. And let's just accept the fact that they likely can't beat the original trilogy's characters or story.\n\nSecond, barely any innovation. Maybe someone will argue about this. But gears 5 looks like it went backward 2 notches. Sure the graphics are nicer, but 1 to 2 to 3 were slapping the crap out of the gaming space when it comes to innovative gameplay. First time you blew up a guy with a wall nade was fun AF. I hated the server advantage back then but boy was it fun. We also got horde mode long time ago. What new came out after? Now its just the same rehashed multiplayer with microtransacrions.\n\nThird, the decline of Xbox. Microsoft dropped the ball on the Xbox One and so there's just less people interested in Microsoft exclusives.\n\nSadly, Halo is also suffering the same problems today. Much the same problems also. Halo Infinite campaign is so bland I don't know if I can keep listening to the monkey make a speech for the 100th time. Ah guess what Halo got though! oPeN wOrLd gAmEpLaY\n\n### Comment ID icgvbi8 with +6 score by [(TierceK, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/icgvbi8/) (in reply to ID icgbg8d):\nInteresting post.\n\nDisagree about campaign, although agree about Del not being utilized enough and some more set pieces would be cool.\n\nStrongly disagree about gameplay. The chain melees, pulling someone over cover, new weapons, improved sprinting or rowdy-run, playable jack, classes, and escape all are new additions which still fit the Gears feeling. Drastic changes like taking away the cover-base system would only make this not feel like Gears anymore.\n\nStrongly agree about the decline of Xbox.

Even a fairly well-supported game like Gears 5 is naturally gonna peter off after a while\n\n* I don't want to say it's 'outdated' or anything, but... most of the gaming world has kind of moved on from the third person cover shooter. Gears is the only one left, really. It was a huge trend back then but it's just not that popular anymore. The gameplay doesn't really have the same kind of infinitely replayable appeal as something like Fortnite or Destiny.\n\n* On a related note, one could argue that the gaming mainstream is kind of 'over' Gears in general - it was hot shit in the late noughties, but the hype's fizzled out a bit as tastes and trends have evolved. Gears 4 and 5 were well received, but I don't think they were really bringing in newer crowds\n\n* Too much competition - there are tons of online multiplayer games being released and updated all the time, all fighting for your attention. Back in the Gears 1-3 days there wasn't nearly as much, online console gaming was still in its early years and was still very novel. You had a lot of copycats but Gears was up there and arguably instrumental in the dominance of the 360 at the time. It's not really the case anymore. Even the latest Halo is 'struggling'\n\n## Comment ID ich9k2s with +2 score by [(MrDysprosium, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/ich9k2s/) (in reply to ID vcttwn):\nWall Bouncing is too niche and unintuitive of a mechanic for the average player to bother investing time into, but without learning that tech, you'll always be less competitive that the typical Gears player.\n\nIt's the same reason Fortnite did away with Building.\n\nSure, it adds depth to the game, but if the average player doesn't want to engage with your super-unique , yet core-to-the-experience mechanic... you either lose that player or you chose to do away with the mechanic.\n\nGoW needs to do away with rapid wall bouncing if they ever want to be big again.,\n\n## Comment ID ichwwy1 with +2 score by [(Hour_Toe_2253, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/ichwwy1/) (in reply to ID vcttwn):\nI love posts like this.

You could give him a redemption story but that's a bit generic and it's more interesting to me if he doesn't get that redemption, he fucked up trying to live up to the family name and if he stays dead then that's just the price to pay for making the mistakes he did.

Men like Marcus and Dom are the men on the ground who suffer from the stress and strain of the machine that is war (it's why they're called 'COGs' and 'Gears'). Marcus is a man who must go through hardship, he is moulded by, shaped by it, and as hard as he tried in Gears 4 he can't escape it; but his character is one who emerges from it. \n\nIn Gears 1 he returns from prison and climbs to the rank of sergeant and leadership, earning his place and respect from others. In 2 he must overcome the loss of his friend (Tai), and his charge (Ben Carmine), and watch his best friend finally reunite with their wife only to euthanise her, before sacrificing the last bastion of ordered civilisation they've known (Jacinto) to stop the Locust...only for it to fail. In 3 he loses his best friend, and later a father he had thought long dead, and then in 4 we learn Anya died and the locust have returned. By JD dying in 5, it fits with the theme of suffering that Marcus constantly endures but no matter the suffering he endures and rises - there's a reason his last name is \"Fenix\" after all. The interesting thing going forward will be is this the thing that finally breaks him, or will he rise again to carry on? \n\nAlso killing JD allows for John Dimaggio an amazing performance, I was dreading the scene leading up to it and was dam near tears; a great blend of subtly and weight behind it.\n\n## Comment ID j98vq10 with +18 score by [(PovasTheOne, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j98vq10/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nI’d like for this stupidity to be retcon and for both characters to be alive in the next game.

So because of that, most people picked JD just because of Marcus connection. in general, i found the whole scene stupid, neither of them should have died there. \"The Coalition\" studio has failed to capture fans with GOW 4 and 5 like the original trilogy did. Which is why the deaths in Gow 4 and 5 are meaningless tbh. Benjamin Carmine death in gow 2 was more emotional and more ppl cared for him after just a couple of hours of gameplay than players do for Del, JD, Kait, etc after 2 full games.\n\n## Comment ID j996aq9 with +19 score by [(ReactiveCypress, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j996aq9/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nI still don't really get why they did this. Gears has never been a Mass Effect like series with decisions to make like this. So now they either have to make two different campaigns based on what decision was made, or render it all pointless by making one of the deaths cannon. Personally, I think JD surviving should be the cannon choice. His rise, fall, and rise again is a much more interesting story, and they can't keep letting Marcus lose his people. Plus there's a lot of parallels between Del dying and Dom dying which can bring Marcus and JD closer.\n\n### Comment ID j99l9bp with +3 score by [(lecherousdevil, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j99l9bp/) (in reply to ID j996aq9):\nThat's my thoughts really.

He clearly has more arc to be told. We are shown he has flaws and recklessness that , while “worked out” with the launching the missile on azura- it did not with the convey/Lizzie. Marcus is very critical of him and he’s struggling to live in Marcus and Anya footsteps . His recklessness affected Baird by forcing his hand with the hammer of dawn - a wound that’s still open. He lied about his involvement with settlement 2. \n\nDel was his best friend - his death hits him hard and becomes the catalyst to getting him back on “the good path” while also bringing JD and Marcus closer together.\n\nDels death cutscenes felt more authentic too. First we get a Marcus and JD heart to heart .  Something JD has wanted since gears 4. Kaits way of saying “he was my friend too” resonated well given their bond from mount katar. We also get a moment of remorse from Fauz when he realized del is gone.\n\nDels story was told- he’s the charismatic best friend - he was there for Kait when she needed someone . He inadvertently brought the whole squad together to mourn his death. \n\nI think either JD surviving is canon or Gears has two campaigns to account for both scenarios (really hope they don’t do this)\n\n5% of me also thinks they keep del alive as canon cause “shock factor” which would be stupid too\n\n## Comment ID j99le0j with +3 score by [(Evergladeleaf, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j99le0j/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nI’m gonna say it, I didn’t like James as a character, though del was a more fun companion and more interesting character\n\nIn a perfect world it’s revealed that no one actually died, but I chose James to die on every playthrough\n\n### Comment ID j9czlas with +3 score by [(VionValor, Reddit, 2023-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j9czlas/) (in reply to ID j99le0j):\nJames was such a dick in this game too lol\n\n## Comment ID j9bh66c with +4 score by [(george_reeves_, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j9bh66c/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nI picked JD to live, I couldn’t do that to Marcus\n\n## Comment ID j99ah9b with +7 score by [(BreakBlue, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j99ah9b/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nHopefully Kait anyway.\n\n## Comment ID j98zuft with +7 score by [(Krakatorn, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j98zuft/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nThey could pull a Wolfenstein and have branching storylines.\n\n### Comment ID j99456k with +10 score by [(xxWolfMan1313xx, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j99456k/) (in reply to ID j98zuft):\nThis, this is what I would like kinda. The beginning of the game Kait can have a flashback to that day and you rechoose who dies. Depending on who you choose is how the game then plays out.\n\nSo my thing is when the character dies it kinda focus’s on the body sliding into the rubble. Then thinking about how you don’t even need to be alive to be turned into the swarm ie the queen that got me thinking.\n\nSo what if she has a new general in the next game. He wears a helmet and you don’t see his face throughout the beginning. Well midway through you come to a point where he removes his helmet revealing it to be either JD or Del in a Swarm like form.\n\nNow if it’s JD the game plays out more brutal. The Swarm are more bloodthirsty and savage. If it’s Del then they are more technologically savvy and really outsmart the player.\n\nAt the point of the reveal if JD, Marcus is stunned to know his son is somewhat alive. If Del, then JD is stunned. Then comes the one on one battle with cleavers. Either father vs son or brother vs brother.\n\nAnd that’s as far as I’ve thought\n\n## Comment ID j997aup with +3 score by [(Stay_Hydrated_Boys, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j997aup/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nWhy didn't she just throw it at her\n\n## Comment ID j99ic8p with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j99ic8p/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nDel should be the dead one.\n\nHe’s boring, he’s bland, he adds nothing, he has no development, and he’s morally perfect AND he’s not connected to any of the main characters and is essentially just ‘Best Friend - The character’.\n\n## Comment ID j99qcez with +3 score by [(jtrom93, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j99qcez/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nDel's death just makes more sense as he's the character Kait spends most of the game with. Their relationship is fleshed-out and developed throughout the game to give Del's death more meaning. It makes much more narrative sense for Kait to lose the friend she's closest with. It's her \"Dom's sacrifice\" moment, where she has to process the loss of her friend, swallow her grief, and fight on. Gears 5 is all about Kait's journey as a character and learning how to keep fighting after heartbreak is the last step she takes in the game.\n\n## Comment ID j9a8s8c with +3 score by [(ec2033, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j9a8s8c/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nneither, retcon that garbage, if you wanna kill a character off just do it, dont force the players to decide.\n\n## Comment ID kiqlhjp with +3 score by [(Spartan_leo_213, Reddit, 2024-01-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/kiqlhjp/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nYou would think if Reyna or Myyrah knew who jd was she would kill him right away because for revenge for Marcus killing her in the end of gears 3\n\n### Comment ID kj2w5wg with +1 score by [(Every_Traffic_8973, Reddit, 2024-01-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/kj2w5wg/) (in reply to ID kiqlhjp):\nYour comment it late but thanks for answering\n\n#### Comment ID kjdd5ge with +1 score by [(Spartan_leo_213, Reddit, 2024-01-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/kjdd5ge/) (in reply to ID kj2w5wg):\nEh yeah dude\n\n## Comment ID j995ejc with +4 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j995ejc/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nI hope it’s Del, his character is kind of shallow.

From a narrative stand-point, it makes more sense. \n\nDel is in the game far more than JD. Del's relationship with everyone makes it more impactful. He's Kait's best friend, especially during the temporary break-up with JD. He's Baird's protégé. He's a second son to Marcus. He's JD's brother. He's JACK's controller, which makes JACK's sacrifice way more emotional if he did it to avenge Del. \n\nPlus, Del's death is what completes Marcus and JD's arc. Marcus was unable to properly grieve Anya with JD and instead sent him to a boarding school. JD is now able to be vulnerable and ask for his father's love, and Marcus is now able to be there for his son when he loses his brother. It repairs their relationship. \n\nJD's death accomplishes nothing narrative-wise and leaves Marcus and JD's arcs unresolved. It's also a very much unneeded emotional toll on Marcus. He lost his parents, his brothers, his friends, his wife, and NOW his only son? No. He doesn't need that much suffering.\n\n## Comment ID j9d1v1w with +1 score by [(Redhood_Ranger, Reddit, 2023-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j9d1v1w/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nListen I like both characters but Marcus went through enough, JD being the canon death would be Marcus’ 13th reason why\n\n## Comment ID j9d4k7p with +1 score by [(BigPapaTubes, Reddit, 2023-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j9d4k7p/) (in reply to ID 116vl2s):\nI would like if there was a third tentacle for kait, and the only option was that all three die.

Like previous leaks said, they were making a smaller sized (possibly horror) game to help prepare them to use UE5 in the future, with a small team later being put together to start the early planning for the next Gears.\n\nHowever, that smaller game got cancelled last year, so they evidently decided to just go full steam ahead on G6. So in reality, it'll really just be your average 4 years, maaaaaybe 5, of dev time total.\n\n### Comment ID k2kr24l with +17 score by [(MLG_Obardo, Reddit, 2023-09-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/16uc8jy/unannounced_the_coalition_game_slated_for_2026_in/k2kr24l/) (in reply to ID k2kph6i):\nMy bet is UE5 isn’t nearly as easy to work with as it is said to be. And Coalition is taking the time needed to make it good.

Why are people suddenly forgetting that the new AAA pipeline is unsustainable? Big budget games take 5 years to make minimum, and since their new IP was seemingly cancelled, then 7 years sounds about right\n\n### Comment ID k2l6zcv with +6 score by [(willc20345, Reddit, 2023-09-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/16uc8jy/unannounced_the_coalition_game_slated_for_2026_in/k2l6zcv/) (in reply to ID k2kph6i):\nThey launched DLC, Tactics, dealt with COVID, changed studio heads, have helped out with countless projects, moved to UE 5 and were working on 2 smaller IP’s.\n\nVideo games don’t take 2/3 years to make anymore, take into account what they’ve been working with and against, an add in the possible Gears collection and the timing checks out.\n\n#### Comment ID k2mrxva with +1 score by [(Happiness_inprogress, Reddit, 2023-09-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/16uc8jy/unannounced_the_coalition_game_slated_for_2026_in/k2mrxva/) (in reply to ID k2l6zcv):\nFrom Software: Hold my beer\n\n### Comment ID k2l98ob with +4 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-09-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/16uc8jy/unannounced_the_coalition_game_slated_for_2026_in/k2l98ob/) (in reply to ID k2kph6i):\nI’m guessing they didn’t immediately start on Gears 6 after 5. There were rumors they were working on a new IP, which then got cancelled, so that likely lost them a chunk of time. They also seem to be linked to other Microsoft Studios for development assistance, so they might be getting stretched in different directions.\n\n#### Comment ID k2lg6sc with +1 score by [(Safe_Climate883, Reddit, 2023-09-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/16uc8jy/unannounced_the_coalition_game_slated_for_2026_in/k2lg6sc/) (in reply to ID k2l98ob):\nI'm pretty sure they helped getting that Matrix demo running on series s.

      "# [Augustus Cole by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2007-10-30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_Cole)\nFictional character in the Gears of War video game series\n\nFictional character\n\nAugustus ColeGears of War characterFirst appearanceGears of War (2006)Designed byCliff BleszinskiVoiced byLester Speight\n\nAugustus \"Cole Train\" Cole is a fictional character in the Gears of War media franchise. He first appeared in the first video game of the series as a supporting character, and has since appeared in some capacity for every mainline and spin-off installment of the Gears of War franchise. Cole is voiced by Lester Speight in all of his video game appearances.\n\nWithin the series, Cole is a former star athlete in his youth who participated in humanity's war with the Locust Horde on the planet Sera by enlisting with the Coalition of Ordered Governments (\"COG\"), a supranational and intergovernmental military collective who are the dominant human political force on Sera. Cole has spent most of his military career alongside his close friend, Damon Baird; unlike Baird and most of Cole's team mates, who are often dour or cynical in temperament, he is usually depicted as a vibrant, enthusiastic character known for his brash humor and infectious energy.\n\nAs one of the most well known characters in the Gears of War series, Augustus Cole has earned a mostly positive reception, but also criticism and accusations of racism by some sources. The character was the subject of legal action launched by Lenwood Hamilton, a former National Football League player who claimed that his publicity rights was infringed upon because the video game character had a number of features he alleged were identified with him or his public persona. Various merchandise for the character, as with other of the series' characters, has been released.\n\nCreation and development\n\n[edit]\n\nCole is named after Phil Cole, a level designer at Epic Games.[1] Cole is concepted as an ex-professional player of Thrashball, a contact sport heavily inspired by American football, prior to the events of the video game series.[2] Cole and Baird's roles were originally reversed, with David Beckham as the inspiration for Baird as a sports star.[1] Former The Coalition studio head Rod Fergusson revealed in an interview that Cole was originally going to be named \"Gus the Bus\", but the developers were concerned that they would infringe on the nickname of a Pittsburgh Steelers football player who matched the Bus reference; as a result, the studio went with the name \"Cole Train\" instead.[3] Fergusson noted that players would be able to pick up references about \"Gus\" if they have played the original game, as the voice actor of series protagonist Marcus Fenix John DiMaggio was instructed to say the \"Gus\" line with Cole, but the studio did not do much more from a dialogue perspective.[3] The development team later used Jamie Foxx's character from the sports drama movie Any Given Sunday as Cole's archetype.[1]\n\nFor Gears of War 3, Cole was originally meant to play a more prominent role; players were supposed to be able to swap between Fenix and Cole throughout the progression of the single player campaign.[4] Cole has a daughter named Hana who first appears in the Hivebusters comic series to support the eponymous squad in their endeavours. The developers originally intended for Hana to appear in the main campaign of Gears 5, but due to story changes during the game's development, her character no longer fit into its narrative; instead, she is redesigned as a scientist who develops a method for infiltrating and destroying enemy Swarm Hives from within in the spin-off Hivebusters comic, which takes place in parallel with the events of Gear 5.[5]\n\nCole is Lester Speight's first role in the video game industry.[6] Speight said the character's popularity led to many fans identifying him as Cole, and they would regularly express their excitement towards him and his work via social media sites, websites and in person.[6] Dan Ryckert from Gameinformer have noted the real-life resemblance of Speight, a former footballer, to his character, commenting that \"casting choices don't get much easier than this\".[7]\n\nAppearances\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Gears of War, Cole and Baird are first encountered by Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago as the surviving members of Alpha Squad. Cole joined Delta Squad after the rest of Alpha Squad is confirmed to be killed in action, and he would remain with Delta Squad throughout the original Gears of War trilogy. He is well known as a sports celebrity in Sera for his career as a Thrashball player prior to \"Emergence Day\", when the Locust Horde first emerged from their subterranean lairs to wage a genocidal war of attrition against humanity 14 years before the events of the first and eponymous video game of the series. In the Gears of War 3 single player campaign, Cole is a playable character from Act One, Chapter 3 until the beginning of Act Two, where he leads a small force to search for supplies in his hometown of Hanover. In Gears of War: Judgement, a prequel set a few months after Emergence Day, Cole appears as one of the game's playable protagonists and a member of Kilo Squad along with squad leader Baird, Onyx Guard cadet Sofia Hendrick and former UIR soldier Garron Paduk.[8]\n\nBy the events of Gears of War 4, which is set more than two decades after the conclusion of the war with the Locust Horde, Cole is regarded by the public as a respected war veteran. He appears in the opening sequence of the game with Victor Hoffman and Samantha Byrne during a speech by COG First Minister Jinn. He appears in the last act to aid Marcus and his son J.D., along with their associates Kait Diaz and Delmont \"Del\" Walker. He also appears in Gears 5 as part of the war effort against the Swarm, the successor to the original Locust Horde. Cole has remained at the rank of private throughout his entire military career as he has rejected every military promotion that has been offered, under the grounds that having rank is not going to affect how many enemies he can kill.\n\nDoctor Hana Cole appears as a supporting character in the Gears 5 downloadable content expansion pack, Hivebusters. Hana tells Team Scorpio that her father was the one who connected her with Colonel Victor Hoffman for the Hivebuster operation and that Cole's introspection on the military and the war had kept her away from the military industrial complex of the COG administration, which is what Cole had wanted. Unlike her father, she takes after her unnamed mother with regards to her lack of interest in sports.\n\nCole is available as a playable character in the franchise's spin-off titles: Gears Pop! and in Gears Tactics as a pre-order exclusive.\n\nPromotion and reception\n\n[edit]\n\nLike other characters in the Gears of War franchise, Augustus Cole has been subject to various merchandise. In 2011, Epic Games released a \"Cole Train Thrashball statue\" depicting Cole wearing a Thrashball-themed sports uniform. It is made out of pure resin and weighs 6.4 pounds.[9]\n\nCole has received a mostly positive critical reception, and is noted as a fan-favorite character.[10][11] In August 2007, North American game-related cable TV channel G4 awarded Speight \"Best Voiceover\" for his performance as Augustus Cole.[12] Staff of the gaming section of the Australian publication The Age ranked Cole #12 on their list of Top 50 Xbox characters of all time in 2008, praising the character for injecting a much-needed dose of comedy and personality into the series.[13] In 2011, Cole placed #46 on a reader's poll organized by Guinness Book of Records for the top 50 video game characters of all time.[14] In an article published by Red Bull, Pete Dreyer included Cole in his list of 10 video game sidekicks who deserve their own games.[11]\n\nThe character has received some negative reception, with most of the criticism accusing the character of serving as a negative racial stereotype.[15] Marc Nix from IGN argued in favor of this point, contrasting Cole's stereotypical speech patterns to Captain Anderson of the Mass Effect series or Dr. Eli Vance of the Half-Life series; Nix noted that both characters have African American heritage, though neither speak in dialog written specifically for a black character, and are simply presented as video game characters that happen to be black. Bitmob criticized Epic Games for designing Cole as a culturally insensitive character who perpetuates outdated ideas of African-Americans, and drew an unfavorable comparison to Dominic Santiago, who is a coded as a Latino character and is depicted as \"cool and level-headed\" by comparison.[16] Allistair Pinsof from Destructoid criticized the story segment in the single player campaign of Gears of War 3 where the player assumes control of Cole.[17] Pinsof opined that Cole's sudden flashback is abrupt and ends with no real meaningful ties to the main Gears narrative, noting that what little backstory it provides for Cole is shallow at best, and that the character's behavior puts everyone including himself in serious danger.[17]\n\nA rap song performed in-character by Speight for the game's end credit has been positively received.[13] Tamoor Hussain from GameSpot praised a new version of the track which was featured in a trailer promoting the release of Gears of War Ultimate Edition in 2016. Hussain compared it to the song Dead Presidents II by JayZ.[18]\n\nLegal issues\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2017, former American football player Lenwood Hamilton sued Epic Games, Microsoft, and Speight, alleging that the character of Augustus Cole is taken from his own likeness and voice without his consent.[19] Hamilton claimed that Speight had approached him around 1998 about a video game, though Hamilton had turned it down due to the violence that would be in the game.[20][21] The lawsuit contended that elements of Cole's character, including his ethnic background, Cole Train nickname, renown for playing professional sports, and clothing were all elements representative of Hamilton, and alleged that voice analysis shows that Speight's delivery of Cole's lines matches closely with Hamilton's speech patterns. Lenwood was ultimately unsuccessful in his bid: according to a Pennsylvania federal court, a motion by Microsoft, Lester Speight and the other defendants for summary judgment on First Amendment grounds was granted, and that the defendants' First Amendment right to free expression in creating the Augustus Cole character that allegedly resembled plaintiff outweighed plaintiff's right of publicity.\"[22][23]",

      "# [Helldivers 2 isn’t on Xbox, but these Game Pass titles can help fill the void by Tomas Franzese on 2024-02-21](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/xbox-game-pass-games-like-helldivers-2/)\nHelldivers 2 is a PlayStation console exclusive, so it’s not available on Xbox Series X or S. Not only has Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer voiced his disappointment in this, but so have many Helldivers 2 players, who are asking for more backup in the fight against the Terminids and Automatons.\n\nIf you don’t own a PS5 or a good enough gaming PC to run Helldivers 2, you might be feeling a bit left out. But if you’re in the mood for a sci-fi or co-op game, there are plenty of entertaining alternate options available on Xbox Game Pass. While Xbox players can’t yet die for Super Earth, they can still have a great time fighting and dying in any of these Xbox Game Pass games that are playable on console.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nDeep Rock Galactic\n\nIf you specifically want another sci-fi co-op game, there are a couple of different options for you on Xbox Game Pass. First, we have Deep Rock Galactic, a co-op shooter about space dwarves who mine resources. In it, you go on missions to caves, gather resources and complete objectives, and then fight to extract with all your gathered resources. While it’s a bit different from Helldivers 2 with its first-person perspective and emphasis on mining, its core gameplay loop actually isn’t too far off from that game. It can offer you plenty of nail-biting emergent moments that you and your friends will be talking about weeks after the fact, which is a hallmark of a fantastic co-op game.\n\nGears 5\n\nHelldivers 2 finally gives PlayStation a console-exclusive answer to Xbox’s Gears of War, its flagship co-op third-person shooter franchise. Obviously, that also means that playing Gears 5 is a good Xbox Game Pass alternative. If you’re missing the single-player or narrative element from Helldivers 2, Gears 5 features a full campaign that will definitely scratch that itch. And if some co-op action is all you want, The Coalition’s game has a cooperative horde mode, as well as Escape, a mission-based mode more similar to the experience that Helldivers 2 provides. If Sony plans to never bring Helldivers 2 to Xbox, then it’s smart for Xbox players to show Microsoft we want more of the closest first-party franchise to Helldivers that it can offer.\n\nRemnant II\n\nA sleeper hit from 2023, Remnant II is the co-op shooter to play if you enjoy the brutally difficult nature of Helldivers 2. It’s a looter shooter that finds a way to incorporate Soulslike elements into its gunplay. Like Helldivers 2 on harder difficulties, Remnant II can be crushingly difficult sometimes, but that makes success all the more satisfying. Its roguelike setup and procedural generation systems also mean each person’s campaign is different, adding to Remnant II’s replay factor and enabling some really memorable moments in co-op. Remnant II also features the best boss fights I’ve encountered in a co-op game.\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Darktide\n\nIf mowing through hordes of enemies is the action from Helldivers 2 that you feel like you’re missing on Xbox, then I’d recommend Warhammer 40,000: Darktide. This four-player co-op, first-person shooter is brutally satisfying to play and emphasizes melee a lot more than the other games on this list. Like Helldivers 2, it understands that there’s simple fun to be had in sci-fi shooter power fantasy, but also isn’t afraid to make things a lot more difficult to force a crushing defeat or exhilarating win.\n\nBack 4 Blood\n\nBack 4 Blood’s zombie premise and mission-based setup are very different from what Helldivers 2 offers, but this is a personal co-op favorite of mine. It is made by Turtle Rock, the same studio behind the Left 4 Dead games, and features some of the best cooperative mission and level design I’ve seen in this wave of AAA shooters. Back 4 Blood’s card system also can drastically alter the difficulty and tools at players’ disposal from run to run, making for a cooperative experience that can be just as unpredictable as Helldivers 2’s missions. Back 4 Blood is a couple of years old and content complete now, so you don’t have to worry about a tail of live service support or overcrowded servers anymore.\n\nExoprimal",

      "# [PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS](https://pubg.wiki.gg/wiki/PLAYERUNKNOWN%27S_BATTLEGROUNDS)\nPLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) is a Battle Royale game in which players are pitted against one another in a fight for survival released on March 23, 2017 for Steam. Roughly a year later, PUBG was released on Xbox One on September 4th, 2018 and later on December 7th, 2018 for the PlayStation 4. PUBG moved to a Free 2 Play model on January 12th, 2022.\n\nLooking for specific versions? You can find those pages at PC / Xbox / PlayStation / Mobile.\n\nAbout BATTLEGROUNDS\n\nPLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) is a competitive survival shooter formally developed/published by Bluehole. PUBG is now being developed by PUBG Corp, a Bluehole subsidiary company [1] in cooperation with Brendan Greene (PLAYERUNKNOWN) as the Creative Director, PUBG is Greene's first standalone game.\n\nPlayers are dropped into a wide, open area, and they must fight to the death - all while the battlefield shrinks, adding pressure to all in its grip. Use a variety of interesting weapons and vehicles amid the BATTLEGROUNDS. \"Killing off another player cuts down on your competition, but it also offers up the opportunity to grab some loot. Your character can only carry around a limited amount of gear, so there are important questions to ask whenever you come across new items. Is it better to stick with your current 9mm pistol, or hold out hope that you'll be able to find ammo for a found 12 gauge shotgun?\"\n\nBATTLEGROUNDS is running on Unreal Engine 4, players take on the Battle Royale experience on one of four maps, each with different characteristics. BATTLEGROUNDS is a good balance between Arma 3 and H1Z1.\n\nBackground/back story?\n\nBATTLEGROUNDS takes place on different islands (maps), but the main island for BATTLEGROUNDS is called Erangel. An abandoned Russian island where a military occupation was controlling the island. The military occupation tested chemical/biological experiments on the islands population, after a resistance attack on a biological facility, the island had to be abandoned.\n\nSpawning into the game?\n\nWhen you spawn, everyone in the game gets put in on a small island where you wait x amount of minutes to load into the game (here to make the players load into the game properly with all the assets, etc.). After the time limit is up during the starting area, you get teleported in a paradrop plane, you get flown over an area and then you get thrown out of a plane with a parachute. Once landed, loot spawns in different areas, it's based on the Arma 3 model, it's all random. The loot system is a lot more in-depth than H1Z1, so there will be more time spent farming for better weapons/attachments/armor, etc.\n\n-- All weapons/items that are on the player or weapon itself don't take up inventory space in your backpack. You can have 1 grenade on your character, while any extra grenades you pick up take up space.\n\nTrivia\n\nThe map name Erangel is based off of PLAYERUNKNOWN's daughter name.\n\nThe Dacia sedan is based off of when PLAYERUNKNOWN watched Top Gear and they always talked about it. Small Top Gear reference/Easter Egg.\n\nBikeMan's dad passed away, in honor of him on the side of Motorcycle w/ sidecar, it has the picture of his dad.\n\nThe designers that are behind the player customization are the those who did it in APB: Reloaded.\n\nPUBG wasn't the first acronym they chose. It was originally called 'PUB' & 'PUGS.' But it was later on changed to PUBG due to the relation of 'PUB' that is common with Pub/bar related search results.\n\nThe saying Winner Winner Chicken Dinner shown for winners at the end of the match. It's featured from PLAYERUNKNOWN's early Battle Royale games/mods.[2]\n\n-- For more Easter Eggs, head to Easter Eggs.\n\nDevelopment\n\nPre-Alpha (NDA) | June - September 2016\n\nAlpha (No NDA) | October - December 2016\n\nClosed Beta | February - March 2017 [3]\n\nSteam Early Access | March 23, 2017 [4]\n\nXbox One Game Preview Release | December 12, 2017 [5]\n\nFull Release | December 21, 2017 Originally, the game was suppose to get out of EA in 6 months from March 23.\n\nFull Xbox One Release | September 4th, 2018\n\nPUBG Project Thai | September, 2018 [6]\n\nPS4 Release | December 7th, 2018\n\nPUBG Project Thai renamed to 'PUBG LITE.' | January 24th, 2019 [7]\n\nGoogle Stadia version of PUBG was released on April 28th, 2020.\n\nPUBG went Free 2 Play on January 12th, 2022.

Whether you’re a fan of Marvel, Pokémon, or hunting monsters the size of skyscrapers, this year’s lineup is looking absolutely fire. We’ve got epic action-adventures like Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra, and mind-bending puzzle games like Professor Layton and the New World of Steam. Not to mention, heavy hitters like Gears of War: E-Day and GTA VI are finally dropping after years of waiting. It’s the year for everyone—whether you’re into dark, creepy horror games (Little Nightmares III) or can’t wait to dive back into Albion with Fable. Let’s be real, you’re gonna want to start saving up now because 2025 is packed with must-play titles. Here’s a preview of the top 13 games that should be on your radar. Ready? Let’s dive in.\n\n1. Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra\n\nYo, Marvel fans, you’re gonna love this one! Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra throws us back into the madness of World War II with a squad you never saw coming: a young Captain America, Black Panther, a Wakandan spy, and some American soldier dude. Together, they’ve gotta shut down Hydra before they take over the world. You’re getting all the action, plus stealth and espionage vibes, so get ready to switch gears real fast. Directed by Amy Henning (yeah, the Uncharted mastermind), this game’s gonna be packed with intense action and cinematic storytelling. And let’s not forget, it’s built from scratch for next-gen consoles, so the visuals? They’re gonna be INSANE. Whether you're a fan of Spider-Man or just love the MCU vibes, Rise of Hydra is definitely gonna scratch that superhero itch. Coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X in 2025, this game’s gonna be FIRE!\n\nGenre: Action-adventure\n\nDeveloper: Skydance New Media\n\nConsoles: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X\n\nRelease: 2025\n\n2. Professor Layton and the New World of Steam\n\nAlright, brainiacs, listen up! Professor Layton and the New World of Steam is bringing back the puzzle master himself, Professor Layton, along with his trusty sidekick, Luke. This one’s set a year after Unwound Future, but now everything’s run by steam-powered tech. So, think old-school detective vibes mixed with some high-tech steampunk swag. You’ll be solving a whole bunch of wild puzzles while exploring this crazy advanced city, trying to crack some mysterious case (because, duh, it’s Layton, there’s always a mystery). Fans of the OG games on DS will totally vibe with this, but even if you’re new to the series, the combo of brain-teasers and slick storytelling is gonna hook you. Plus, the art style? STILL on point. It’s coming to Switch in 2025, and I know y’all are hyped for some fresh Layton action.\n\nGenre: Puzzle\n\nDeveloper: Level-5\n\nConsoles: Switch\n\nRelease: 2025\n\n3. Gears of War: E-Day\n\nYo, Gears fans, we’re goin’ back to where it all started with Gears of War: E-Day! This prequel’s taking us back to the literal day the Locust came outta nowhere and wrecked humanity’s whole vibe. It’s all about that Emergence Day chaos. You’ll be right in the middle of it, fighting alongside new characters (and maybe some old faves), trying to survive the first wave of this war. Expect those signature Gears cover-based shootouts, epic set pieces, and BRUTAL combat. If you’ve played Gears before, you already know how intense this is gonna be, but as a prequel, it’s gonna dig deeper into the story, giving us more lore. Plus, the next-gen graphics? Yeah, they’re gonna be jaw-dropping. Get your Lancers ready, ‘cause it’s dropping on Xbox Series X and PC in 2025.\n\nGenre: Shooter\n\nDeveloper: The Coalition Studio\n\nConsoles: Xbox Series X, PC\n\nRelease: 2025\n\n4. Little Nightmares III\n\nAlright horror junkies, get ready to be spooked AGAIN ‘cause Little Nightmares III is coming for your nightmares (pun intended). This time around, we’ve got new characters wandering through even more twisted, creepy environments, filled with disturbing creatures that’ll have you clutching your controller. If you loved the eerie vibe of the first two games, then this one’s gonna take things to a whole new level. It’s still got that combo of puzzle-solving and platforming, but the horror elements? Yeah, they’ve cranked it up. Supermassive Games (the folks who made Until Dawn) are behind this one, so you KNOW they’re bringing that next-level tension. Whether you’re creepin’ through dark hallways or running for your life, this game’s gonna keep you on edge the whole time. It’s droppin’ on all major platforms—PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Switch—so no excuses, y’all. Prepare to lose sleep in 2025!\n\nGenre: Puzzle, Platformer\n\nDeveloper: Supermassive Games\n\nConsoles: PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X\n\nRelease: 2025\n\n5. Fable\n\nIt’s been like FOREVER (14 Years!), but Fable is finally making a comeback in 2025! If you’ve never played Fable before, you’re in for a treat. It’s an action RPG with a world straight out of a fairytale—except this time, there’s some serious choices you gotta make, and those choices? Yeah, they matter. You’ll be playin’ as Humphry, a retired hero who gets pulled back into the chaos when a new threat shows up. Expect quirky characters, magical creatures, and a world where your moral decisions literally shape everything around you. The game’s getting a full reboot by Playground Games (yep, the same folks behind Forza), so you KNOW it’s gonna look stunning on next-gen hardware. Expect a mix of humor, action, and fantasy that feels both familiar and fresh. Fable is coming to PC and Xbox Series X—get ready to dive back into Albion!\n\nGenre: Action RPG\n\nDeveloper: Playground Games\n\nConsoles: PC, Xbox Series X\n\nRelease: 2025\n\n6. DOOM: The Dark Ages\n\nImagine DOOM, but in medieval times. Yeah, let that sink in. DOOM: The Dark Ages takes the fast-paced, rip-and-tear combat you know and love and throws you into a dark fantasy world where you’re battling dragons, knights, and all sorts of medieval monsters. You’re still playin’ as the Doom Slayer, but instead of high-tech guns, you’re gonna have to get a little medieval with it. New weapons, new abilities, and a whole new vibe, but trust me, the intensity is still VERY MUCH there. Developed by id Software, the graphics are gonna be off the charts with a dark, Gothic style that’s gonna make every battle look EPIC. If you’re into brutal, chaotic first-person shooters, DOOM: The Dark Ages is gonna blow your mind. Coming in 2025 to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X, this game’s gonna be a bloodbath.\n\nGenre: Action, First-person shooter\n\nDeveloper: id Software\n\nConsoles: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X\n\nRelease: 2025\n\n7.

Building on the open-world vibes from Legends: Arceus, Z-A gives you more freedom than ever. You’ll be exploring vast environments, discovering new Pokémon species, and getting into battles that feel a lot more connected to the story. This time, there’s a real focus on the relationships between humans and Pokémon, and yeah, you can RIDE some of your Pokémon around now! The whole thing’s packed with new mechanics, fresh adventures, and a story that’ll have you totally immersed. Exclusively on the Switch in 2025, this is gonna be a MUST-play for all you Trainers out there. Time to catch ‘em all again!\n\nGenre: RPG\n\nDeveloper: Game Freak\n\nConsoles: Switch\n\nRelease: 2025\n\n8. Monster Hunter Wilds\n\nHuntin’ monsters is about to get WILD. Monster Hunter Wilds takes everything you love about the Monster Hunter series and drops it into a massive open world that’s all about survival. You’re not just takin’ down giant monsters anymore—you’ve gotta gather resources, craft weapons, and deal with whatever the wilderness throws at you. Capcom’s amped up the AI, so the monsters are smarter, deadlier, and have more unique behaviors depending on their environment. Weather systems, evolving ecosystems, and dynamic co-op multiplayer mean no two hunts are the same. Oh, and did I mention it’s BEAUTIFUL? The game’s gonna look incredible on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X. Whether you’re a veteran hunter or a total noob, Monster Hunter Wilds in 2025 is gonna be an adventure you won’t wanna miss.\n\nGenre: Adventure RPG\n\nDeveloper: Capcom\n\nConsoles: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X\n\nRelease: 2025\n\n9. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach\n\nHideo Kojima’s back at it with the sequel to Death Stranding—and Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is looking even weirder and more epic than the first game. You’re back in the boots of Sam Porter Bridges (yep, played by Norman Reedus again) in this dystopian future where delivering packages is way more intense than it sounds. This time, the world’s bigger, the stakes are higher, and the mysterious forces you’re fighting? Even more bizarre. Expect the same mix of walking-simulator mechanics and cryptic storytelling, but with new action sequences, freaky visuals, and a deeper narrative. Kojima’s not playin’ around, y’all. Coming exclusively to PS5 in 2025, this game’s gonna mess with your head—in the best way possible.\n\nGenre: Action\n\nDeveloper: Kojima Productions\n\nConsoles: PS5\n\nRelease: February 28, 2025\n\n10. Grand Theft Auto VI\n\nYou thought Rockstar was done? Nah. Grand Theft Auto VI is FINALLY dropping in 2025, and it’s taking us back to Vice City. This time, the world’s MASSIVE, with dynamic weather, evolving NPCs, and a level of realism that’s gonna blow your mind. Rumor has it, we’re getting multiple playable characters and an even more detailed heist system. Whether you’re causing chaos in the streets, pulling off insane heists, or just living that digital crime life, GTA VI is gonna set a new bar for open-world games. Rockstar’s been keeping details on the low, but you already know it’s gonna be packed with action, satire, and some wild storylines. If you’ve been waiting for GTA VI as long as the rest of us, 2025 can’t come soon enough!\n\nGenre: Action-adventure\n\nDeveloper: Rockstar Games\n\nConsoles: PS5, Xbox Series X\n\nRelease: Fall 2025\n\n11. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond\n\nSamus Aran’s BACK, baby! Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is dropping on the Switch in 2025, and after years of delays, it’s about to blow fans away. We don’t know much about the story, but it’s gonna pick up where the Prime series left off, with more first-person action, exploration, and puzzle-solving. You’ll be diving deep into uncharted territories, battling new enemies, and discovering more about the dark secrets of the galaxy. With updated graphics, motion controls, and new power-ups, Metroid Prime 4 is gonna feel both classic and fresh at the same time. Whether you’re a longtime fan or totally new to the series, this is one Switch game you’re NOT gonna wanna miss.\n\nGenre: First-person action-adventure\n\nDeveloper: Retro Studios\n\nConsoles: Switch\n\nRelease: 2025\n\n12. Civilization VII\n\nStrategy lovers, get ready! Civilization VII is coming in 2025, and it’s looking like the most complex and deep Civ game yet. As always, you’ll be guiding your empire through the ages, but Firaxis is promising some huge upgrades to AI, diplomacy, and combat systems. The whole “one more turn” addiction is gonna be REAL with this one. Expect new civilizations, revamped game mechanics, and visuals that’ll look stunning on next-gen hardware. Whether you’re trying to conquer through military, diplomacy, or tech, Civ VII is gonna challenge you like never before. Set your calendars for February 2025, because world domination is about to get a whole lot more interesting.\n\nGenre: Strategy\n\nDeveloper: Firaxis Games\n\nConsoles: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X\n\nRelease: February 6, 2025\n\nAnd there you have it, folks—the biggest games dropping in 2025 that’ll have us glued to our screens for hours on end. Whether you’re ready to punch through WWII as Captain America in Marvel 1943 or gearing up to take on massive dragons in DOOM: The Dark Ages, there’s no shortage of excitement coming our way.
