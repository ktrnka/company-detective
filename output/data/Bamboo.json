      "# [Dos and Donâts: LinkedIn Ads](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/post/dos-and-donts-linkedin-ads)\nLinkedIn has over 1 billion users worldwide with 65 million business decision-makers using the platform to connect with customers, employees, and other professionals. Like other social media platforms, LinkedIn has an advertising option. But is it effective?\n\nReports show that itâs 277% more effective for lead gen than Facebook or Twitter and offers three times the conversion rates of competitors.\n\nWith such good results, itâs possible that LinkedIn ads can benefit your company, but knowing a few best practices can help you get more out of every penny spent.\n\n1. Do target highly-specific groups\n\nLinkedIn allows for very narrow, niche targeting, so take advantage of this by drilling down for the audience you want to see your brand. It can take time to figure out what groups or keywords these audiences use, but when you find them, donât be afraid to personalize your messaging to speak to them directly. Choose an objective and align that objective accordingly with your target audience, leveraging LinkedIn's robust targeting capabilities.\n\nWhat kind of targeting can you look for? Over 39,000 skills are listed by users on LinkedIn, giving you some great insight into what words users prefer when referring to their careers. When you find your ideal customer, check out their skills. This can be a treasure trove of insight for future ad messaging. You can also go further by speaking with leads directly through their inbox.Â\n\nThe Bamboo team shares, âin Conversation and Sponsored Messaging Ads, leverage macros to substitute in personalized variables like a user's name, job position, or employer.â\n\nThis will help your message stand out from the other message requests they get and may help you land the deal, since theyâll see a message that targets them specifically.\n\n2. Donât advertise items that arenât relevant\n\nLinkedIn is a unique ad platform that caters to business professionals, job seekers, and those with B2B offerings. Itâs not ideal for certain brands, such as those in consumer health and lifestyle, unless you can tie in a business need. Lipstick may not be a good fit, but a new vitamin blend that supports the needs of the busy C-level professional may be. Just be sure it really fits the tone of other posts being shared on LinkedIn. Advertising ill-fitting brands is a waste of money and can damage your brand.\n\n3. Do start with conversation ads\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Conversation Ads, or those that land directly in a user's inbox, are hard to ignore.\n\nâConversation ads are a lesser known but very impactful ad format,â explains Bamboo's team of Growth Marketing Managers. âThey also have a cool decision tree mechanism that functions like a chatbot or choose-your-own-adventure.â\n\nFor busy marketing professionals, this can help you save time in replying to messages while still delivering highly-personalized messages to those who are most likely to buy your products or services.\n\n4. Â Donât be afraid of the price tag\n\nLinkedIn has a daily minimum ad buy of $10 and a campaign minimum of $100, but the CPM may be higher than what companies have paid on other platforms. Consider all the ways to put your money to good use.\n\nâSome advertisers' eyes may pop out looking at CPM costs. LinkedIn is a more expensive platform, but the value lies in the targeting. While the impressions may be costly to deliver, keep a close eye on cost-per-conversion and conversion rate to ensure your campaigns perform up to benchmark.â\n\nIt's recommended to take a little extra time to figure out Lead Form Opens to Impressions to get a better idea of how your Conversation Ads are doing instead of the click-through rate (CTR) or the open rates provided by the LinkedIn reporting platform. This is especially important for getting native lead forms out through the messaging option.\n\nLinkedIn may not be the first place you think of spending your ad dollars, but this platform already attracts professionals willing to spend a significant amount of money for LinkedIn Premium Business, Sales Navigator Core, or Recruiter Lite features. Currently, 39% of users pay for LinkedIn Premium, and 37% of millionaires are LinkedIn members.",
      "# [How Turo decreased Host CPA 73% with Bamboo](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/turo)\nTo measure the effectiveness of mobile app campaigns, they also needed to test operating systems (iOS/Android) to determine where paid social investment should be allocated.Â\n\nBamboo built multiple mobile app install ad variations to test which creative assets and formats worked best; carousel, static image (with and without copy overlay), or video format. The team tested these formats simultaneously with audience targeting including car owners with a single or multi-car household, home-sharers, online car marketplaces, and a lookalike audience built from users who have already listed their cars on Turo.Â\n\nOn Instagram, the team discovered quickly that static image ads outperformed carousel and video format ads, while on Facebookâs Mobile News Feed, carousel ad format outperformed static and video formats in terms of driving owners to complete listing their vehicle on Turoâs app.",
      "# [How Highlights saw a 65% lift in CVR with Bamboo](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/highlights)\nBamboo simultaneously ran product tag and non-product tag split tests through the Meta A/B testing tool to compare insights. This allowed them to better understand performance and the next steps if a similar test were to be run again.Â\n\n*Bamboo ran this test in partnership with the Meta marketing science team to ensure a statistically significant result.\n\nWhat are Product Tags?\n\nProduct Tags allow shoppers to seamlessly shop Highlightsâ products right on their Facebook feed, moving easily from discovery to final purchase without having to leave the platform. Some of the key benefits of ads with Meta product tags are driving traffic, post engagement, and maximizing the reach of a brandâs shoppable products right on the platform. Shopping ads with product tags can also help businesses grow their pool of shopping Custom Audiences who can be re-engaged with through retargeting ads later on.",
      "# [How The Black Tux decreased customer acquisition costs 37% with Bamboo](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/theblacktux)\nThe strategy centered around leveraging Facebook's unique relationship targeting abilities to acquire high-value customers, while also developing and testing immersive ad formats suited for storytelling and product showcasing.\n\nâFacebookâs relationship status audiences allow us to target high-value potential customers and nurture them over the course of their engagement until theyâre ready to think about the groom and groomsmen attire. Our goal is that, by that time, we will have convinced them to choose us.â - Matt Gierl, VP of Growth & Marketing at The Black Tux\n\nThe team first combined multiple audience attributes and filters. Targeting consumers ages 18 to 65 with an âEngagedâ relationship status, Bamboo split out the Black Tux campaigns between men and women in order to serve the most relevant creative to each.\n\nBamboo leveraged Lookalike Audiences of current customers and interested customers, which doubled the addressable audience size and helped lower acquisition costs. Bamboo also used Custom Audiences to retarget people who had previously engaged with the companyâs website.\n\nBamboo diversified creative testing by using ad formats including video ads, Instagram Stories, collections, and carousels. Through testing and optimizing these formats, the team found that immersive formats like collection and carousel ads led to the most conversions, beating static image ads by up to 238%.",
      "# [How Peloton decreased cost per install by 33% with Bamboo](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/peloton)\nThe Bamboo team prioritized Facebook and Instagram, developing campaigns targeting multiple attributes and filters such as Custom Lists, Lookalike Audiences, Broad Interests, Behaviors, and Keywords. Custom Lists and Lookalike audiences performed 13% better than Broad Interests and Keywords. The team also tested targeting based on gender, with Female audiences proving to be top performers on Instagram and Males outperforming on Facebook.\n\nBamboo tested video, carousel, and static assets across both Instagram and Facebook. A mix of static and video assets were needed on Instagram. The team tested square video, vertical video, and video carousels. Lastly, they tested showcasing various uses of the mobile app, whether it be at home, in the gym, or in-studio at Peloton.Â\n\nThis successful partnership enabled Peloton to efficiently promote its mobile app, driving more than 10,000 new first-time Peloton class attendees.Â",
      "# [How Rewind Used Paid Media to Amplify Rapid Organic Growth](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/rewind)\nBamboo & Rewind executed a testing strategy across Google, Meta, LinkedIn, and Reddit to quickly identify what worked and what didnât. The teams tested tactics, placements, copy, and creatives to ensure messaging resonated with targeted audiences.Â\n\nEvery channel & tactic served a purpose. Efficiency was found in Googleâs Performance Max campaign, enabling it to become the top-performing ad type. Bamboo leaned on this campaign type to drive efficiency while continuing to test creative & messaging through other channels. Google Searchâs copy and keyword performance led Bamboo to hone in on top use cases and helped identify additional audience segments. Meta was the main lever used for creative testing of value props, imagery, and asset types, which allowed the teams to uncover that user reviews drive strong performance.",
      "# [How HotelTonight improved ROAS with Bamboo](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/hoteltonight)\nHotelTonight is a mobile app for booking last-minute hotel deals, offering discounted rates for rooms booked on the same day or up to a week in advance. Acquired by Airbnb in 2019, it caters to spontaneous travelers and features a range of hotel options with an easy-to-use interface. Looking for a way to extend their commitment to boldness to their advertising strategy, HotelTonight chose Bamboo to be their growth partner.\n\nHaving seen organic success on Facebook and Instagram, HotelTonight wanted to introduce paid campaigns to the media mix. Bamboo needed to build a personalized strategy to explore the new medium in a way that would reach the right audience, consisted of new creative outlets to express HotelTonight's unique style, and most importantly, had strong performance gains compared to other channels.\n\nBamboo used the transfer of knowledge from organic to paid audiences to save HotelTonight weeks of test budgets and campaigns in order to find the right targeting fit. Performance started off strong by staying consistent with HotelTonight's brand voice as paid campaigns were launched.\n\nHotelTonight enlisted the helped of Bamboo's creative services to rapidly design and test new concepts, allowing them to study and understand user behavior as fast as they possibly could.\n\nWith the transfer of audience knowledge from organic to paid and the creative success that was found, HotelTonight quickly achieved click-through-rates that were meaningfully higher than any other channel they were running and click-to-install rates that nearly doubled from their Instagram Ads.\n\nThe collective impact of numerous successful initiatives led to a significant improvement in HotelTonight's Instagram advertising performance. When measured against other new acquisition channels in the same period, Instagram campaigns yielded notably better outcomes, including:\n\nImprove ROAS 31%Â\n\nDecrease cost per install 17%Â\n\nDecrease in cost per purchase 16%",
      "# [How Great Jones improved first purchaser AOV with Bamboo](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/greatjones)\nThe Challenge\n\nGreat Jones needed to shift KPI focus to retain customers longer\n\nPrior to collaboration with Bamboo, Great Jones aimed to acquire as many users as possible under a strict customer acquisition cost, resulting in customers who were less invested in the brand and had low retention. With this outlook, first-time purchaser CPA was critical and ultimately limited the ability to scale.\n\nGreat Jones needed an efficient growth strategy that would move them away from short-term ROAS goals and toward loyal customers who were likely to drive additional long-term revenue.\n\nBamboo's Approach\n\nRefining strategies to target higher-value products & shift focus towards customer LTV\n\nBamboo first shifted focus on launching campaigns that attracted potential customers exclusively to product SKUs that did one of two things; yielded additional revenue on first purchases or had high repeat purchase rates.\n\nNext, Bamboo's growth team utilized its analytics capabilities to help interpret user data that signaled better long-term outcomes. Bamboo shifted the primary KPI to user-LTV and focused on acquiring users who were more invested in the brand and making first-time purchases of higher-priced products that were much more valuable.\n\nThe Results\n\nBamboo helps Great Jones improve ROAS 109% and increase monthly revenue of new cohorts\n\nBy shifting the acquisition investments from single products to high-value SKUsâ, Great Jones &Â Bamboo were able to increase the overall return on ad spend by 109%.\n\nBamboo built trust with Great Jones to scale their growth program well over the cap that a low cost-per-acquisition target was previously limiting them to.\n\nAs part of the long-term framework, they were able to achieve an increase in the monthly revenue of newly acquired cohorts.",
      "# [How AllTrails improved app conversion rate 40% with Bamboo](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/alltrails)\nCOVID-19 changed human behavior. It's as simple as that. People opting for outdoors instead of indoors, shopping at home instead of in-person â all while finding new ways to connect. Throughout the dynamic year, Bamboo had to learn how to adjust its campaign strategy to position AllTrails as the go-to product to stay healthy, mentally and physically.\n\nBamboo aimed to harness the momentum of interest within the client's vertical by attracting loyal, long-term customers in an increasingly competitive space, with the goal of improving app retention.\n\nBamboo strategized to attract users likely to explore new health alternatives during a global pandemic using a localized and seasonal approach. This was supported by a multifaceted campaign strategy:\n\n- Restructured geo targeting tiers across paid social and realigned on KPIs per tier\n\n- Accelerated investment ahead of highly seasonal milestones\n\n- Leveraged tCPA app campaigns with Google\n\nBamboo optimized toward a mid-funnel event that preceded the main KPI in the user funnel. This gave the team confidence that the algorithm would receive ample conversion volume to learn quickly. Bamboo also monitored user cohorts to understand and react to changes in user behavior after the initial acquisition.\n\nBy adopting Bamboo's growth strategy, AllTrails was able to take advantage of the growing demand in their industry and position themselves as the market leader in outdoor trail navigation apps. Bamboo's strategy allowed a new and diverse set of users to discover a healthy way to recreate during a global pandemic. The approach also allowed for:\n\nRapidly expanded total market coverage with the launch of new Google App campaigns (6x YoY increase in investment)\n\nImprovement in YoY growth by 40% with in-app conversion ratesÂ\n\nImprovement in average monthly LTV by 52%",
      "# [How Upside improved new user retention with Bamboo](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/upside)\nUpside, a localized savings app, gives you real cash back on gas, groceries, and restaurants. They came to Bamboo wanting to scale their growth program.\n\nBamboo evaluated GetUpside's growth goals against their existing KPIs and worked with them to implement localized CAC goals based on user-LTV in that area. Bamboo discovered was that:\n\nThe client was losing out on significant revenue by targeting a universal KPI / CAC, having limited visibility into long-term performance, and focusing only on funnel-optimization versus value-optimization.\n\nâ\n\nThe average new user cohorts were churning quickly.\n\nMoving beyond channel management, Bamboo took a deep dive into our clientâs digital ads, ad attribution, and product analytics to seek out opportunities. We worked on a strategy that would allow us to set goals based on real-world information by including an analysis of retention and ARPU by location, channel, and mobile operating system.\n\nUsing data analytics to focus on value-optimization, we were able to better understand the behaviors that signaled a strong user. As a result, the average new cohort was retaining for much longer which allowed our client to capture additional revenue.",
      "# [How Digit improved app conversion rate 386% with Bamboo](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/digit)\nAfter achieving success on paid social channels, Bamboo &Â Digit's goal was to expand into Google App Campaigns.\n\nThe team had to meet tight performance goals while scaling. Digit was already spending at scale across varying paid social channels. As the clientâs new agency, it was up to us to prove out a new growth channel to reach new users at a similar or better cost than existing acquisition sources were providing.\n\nBamboo started by utilizing the best practices of each unique channel. Google App Campaigns can be fickle, so its best to let the algorithm build enough learnings at each stage in the event funnel, so it can work for you vs against you! This tried and true method requires patience, communication, and understanding, but the payoff is well worth avoiding any shortcuts. Â\n\nWe launched the client with a Max Installs campaign- a new app with no history needs a starting point.\n\nBy the second month, our client was seeing enough conversions to move to a Target Cost per Action (tCPA) campaign driving up the conversion rate close to goal.\n\nThe next several months were focused on creative testing culminating in taking advantage of a video-only campaign.\n\nBamboo utilized Google App Campaigns to drive significant growth for Digit at highly competitive costs, resulting in:\n\nIncrease scale by 83% m/m\n\nImprove conversion rate between month one and three by 386%\n\nGrow key conversion event volume 60x between month one and ten\n\nBamboo won the Premier Partner Award for âApp Excellenceâ by utilizing best practices across Googleâs suite of ad products for our work with Digit, an all-in-one subscription-based money app that budgets, saves, and invests for you.",
      "# [How Providers App decreased user acquisition costs with Bamboo](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/providers)\nProviders is a free, #1 rated app that five million households now use to manage their EBT, WIC, SSI, unemployment, debit, and other benefits. Built with the intention of lessening the administrative burden that makes benefits hard to obtain, the Providers App aims to give back the time and emotional resources of those who need help. Bamboo and Providers teamed up with the goal of increasing brand trust and lowering cost per app registration.\n\nWith the UGC launch on Meta, Bamboo aimed to capture the attention of more qualified users within our existing top-performing Android campaigns. This initiative was supported by the following elements:Â\n\n2-week A/B test through Metaâs experiments functionÂ\n\nEvergreen Android campaign that was our top-performant at the time\n\nDemographic audience targeting that attempted to reach our core persona\n\nThe campaign optimized towards an event that preceded the main KPI to ensure we would gain enough volume for the algorithm to learn quickly. We monitored both events throughout the test so we could be confident in the results.Â\n\n*Due to the limited iOS targeting options and the skew of Android users on the app, we chose to not replicate this test for iOS initially.\n\nBamboo immediately saw positive impacts during the initial two-week test. These results would end up being a catalyst for expansion of the UGC offering and the Providersâ paid social program. In the first 2 weeks of the A/B test, the UGC creatives made by Bamboo Creative Studio (BCS) quickly became more efficient than historic top-performing ads. The UGC launch led to the following results for Providers:\n\nDecrease in cost per registration by 68%\n\nIncrease in ad engagement click-through rate by 15%\n\nIncrease in paid social ad spend by 20%",
      "# [How Rebag increased AOV by 50% with Bamboo](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/rebag)\nRebagâs unique business required an equally one-of-a-kind advertising strategy; maintaining the Rebag brand while developing new creative was essential. The Rebag team wanted to maintain a more upscale, minimalist look. Bamboo produced ads that did just that.Â\n\nLanding on an initial style that Rebag loved, the Bamboo team worked with Rebagâs in-house design team to brainstorm and build variations of copy, borders, video, and carousels â until top-performers were discovered. \"The Rebag brand is extremely important to us, so images that conveyed a luxurious product were a must-have. Using the creative approach Bamboo came up with, we can deliver ads that hit Rebagâs creative and business goals.\" - Elizabeth Layne, Chief Marketing Officer at Rebag\n\nWe worked closely with Rebagâs team to begin testing ideas and iterations. Due to Rebagâs designer bags coming in at a high price point, it can be hard to find a consistent sweet spot when advertising. As a way to keep sales steady, Bamboo included a healthy mix of dynamic and non-dynamic product ads for prospecting. This allowed the team to capture favorable ROAS for non-dynamic ads, but build volume and consistency with dynamic ads. Combining the performance of all prospecting ads, Bamboo helped Rebag start off strong with a ROAS that improved over time.",
      "# [How Webflow 10x'd lead volume with Bamboo](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/webflow)\nThe benefits afforded to an enterprise lead gen program by LinkedIn Advertising are immediately apparent: through its unique targeting options, you can reach highly-specific groups with tailored messaging on a platform where people are engaging in a business mindset.\n\nThe challenge on LinkedIn is to run campaigns cost-efficiently. Thereâs no getting around it â impressions and clicks are pricey on LinkedIn. Committing to gradual improvement overtime and aggressively searching for opportunities to optimize are key to succeeding on this platform. The average cost-per-click for LinkedIn ads is around $5.26, while Facebookâs average CPC is $0.97. Cost of course varies case-by-case, but the same principle generally applies between platforms.\n\nIn order to generate meaningful performance improvements, Bamboo needed to launch countless tests, take big swings, learn from losses and iterate upon wins. The approach came down to shifting away from a full-funnel approach to consolidate into KPI driving campaigns only, test and refine core audiences, lean into lead magnet assets and gated content, and leverage unique ad formats such as Conversation Ads.\n\nBamboo observed that when upper-funnel campaign spend is incorporated into overall CPA, the blended rate was not efficient enough to achieve goals. In response, Bamboo collapsed the funnel into two stages: gated content at the top and demo offers at the bottom.\n\nThe team was able to evolve the targeting approach by casting a wide net to start, and then testing out different segments within that pool. When a winning segment was identified, Bamboo would get even more specific with things like job function, job titles, and company size.\n\nOn average, ads promoting Webflowâs blog content had 25% higher CTR than the product demo campaigns. Bamboo leveraged this insight to find a happy medium between the two approaches â keeping audiences engaged with content offerings, with the caveat that the asset is unlocked through submission of a contact form.\n\nThe team found early success with native lead gen forms and conversation ads. Conversation ads were leveraged for their benefit of keeping the experience on-platform and utilizing their decision tree mechanism that functions like a chatbot or choose-your-own-adventure game. The end result is a highly targeted, highly personalized message delivered directly to a userâs inbox.",
      "# [Lemonaid Health: Seed Stage to $400M Exit with Bamboo](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/lemonaidhealth)\nIn the rapidly evolving telehealth industry, Lemonaid Health faced a multifaceted challenge that hindered its growth and market penetration. They offered an extensive range of telehealth services, each with unique customer acquisition costs and lifetime values, resulting in a complex and inefficient paid media strategy. This abundance of SKUs led to varying customer acquisition costs that made it difficult for Lemonaid Health to allocate its media budget effectively. Consequently, they heavily over-indexed toward paid search. This over-reliance on paid search not only limited the company's reach but also stunted its ability to explore and capitalize on other channels that could offer better ROI.\n\nLemonaid Health came to Bamboo to optimize their media spend and align the spend with their overall goal of maximizing customer lifetime value. Before the partnership, Lemonaid struggled to differentiate between what drove long-term customer loyalty versus what attracted more transactional, one-time purchases.\n\nBamboo first prioritized paid social by optimizing Facebook strategies with focused testing on evergreen content and pricing messages to engage new patients. They quickly diversified assets using Bambooâs Creative Services, launching videos including in-house and UGC testimonials that featured medical industry professionals to increase trust and credibility.\n\nWithin 2 months, Bamboo expanded into paid search, diversifying the paid search strategy to widen reach. They tested non-brand keywords and optimized creatives and landing pages to boost engagement and conversions. Bamboo broadened Lemonaid's presence with Google Shopping and Display and used Universal App Campaigns to acquire both new and churned patients\n\nBamboo utilized paid search, paid social, and Lemonaidâs first-party analytics to identify key drivers of both short-term and long-term revenue across Lemonaidâs telehealth SKUs. These insights refined Lemonaid Health's strategy and allowed them to drive fast and sustainable growth.",
      "# [How Furkin increased enrollment volume by 136% with Bamboo](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/furkin)\nThe Bamboo and the Furkin team collaborated on not only paid media strategies and creative, but also acted on opportunities to increase quote > enrollment rate by improving user experience and honing in on brand messaging. Both teams looked beyond channel management to paid program strategy and landing page experience to make sure potential enrollees had a holistic &Â compelling view of the brand from start to finish. Â\n\nSocial vs SearchÂ\n\nWith view-through conversions and Appleâs privacy laws, one of the larger challenges was having clear visibility into social performance on a business level. To understand better how the channels interact with each other and the business, Bamboo tested the media mix between search and social and the impact on brand volume. Additionally, testingÂ a different channel split and noting impact on overall performance was critical as Bamboo landed on a 70/30 Social/Search split.\n\nThis will vary for different advertisers based on the industry, and awareness of the brand in the market. With Furkin being a new brand, it aligned with the objective of also increasing overall awareness of the brand.\n\nIncremental geo expansion driven by higher confidence in strategy\n\nBamboo found success within platforms by targeting most populous cities and regions within Canada. As campaign scaled, expanding into new territories was deliberate and intentional. Bamboo expanded into specific zip codes and provinces before extending our media reach to a country wide target. At this time, there was high confidence in the strategy since winning creatives, messaging and overall media strategy had been identified.\n\nSocial testingÂ\n\nWithin Social, Bamboo leaned heavily into testing various aspects of our strategy. With lower budgets, Bamboo established testing strategies that ranged from A/B tests, and informal testing with benchmarks and check in cadences to make quick decisions based on directional data (platform + business level).\n\nSearch\n\nSince Google noted higher conversion volume, we set up campaigns optimizing for Enrollments. However, since we were limited by budgets, the campaigns were set at Maximize conversions. In Q3, Search scaled 64% driving 110% more enrollments Q/Q at a 22% efficient CPE. We were able to unlock this using a mix of strategies laid out below.\n\nBrand vs Non Brand\n\nOn search, the objective was to scale within the pet insurance categoryÂ with our Non Brand effort since we wanted to lean into the most incremental tactic while capturing all brand demand that social was generating. Over the quarter, Bamboo successfully increased Non Brand split from 59% -> 70% which drove 128% more enrollments at a 14% more efficient CPE.\n\nScaling Non Brand with Broad + Phrase & Exact + DSAÂ\n\nUnlocking Non Brand in an extremely competitive market was critical for Bamboo since it would prove to be the most incremental. Bamboo wasable to do this leaning into a multi pronged approach leaning into DSA to capture and mine new queries while testing Broad Match at lower budgets and using phrase & exact campaigns to maintain control on performance. As a result, Non Brand scaled 94%.Â Â\n\nWhile the Bamboo team worked on media strategies, the Furkin team worked quickly internally to facilitate a better user experience across the media touch points and at a product level. They were able to do this successfully by:",
      "# [How Adobe Creative Cloud increased return on marketing spend with YouTube Shorts](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/adobecreativecloud)\nAdobe has been a market leader in its industry for years, but they needed to explore new ways to reach its target audience and grow its revenue. To achieve this, Adobe Creative Cloud and Document Cloud decided to expand into new mobile-first placements across social and video platforms.\n\nAligning creative formats and content to mobile-only placements was one of the biggest challenges for Adobe. They needed to strategize new creative that was engaging yet action-driven. They also needed to adjust their short-form creative strategy to be awareness-focused vs. direct response.\n\nYouTube Shorts was chosen as a test for new ad placements with a goal of understanding their value and efficiencies. Bamboo started by helping Adobe determine how best to leverage their existing creatives, as well as creator-led content. Once Adobe agreed on placements and prepared user-generated content and branded creative, the Bamboo team added YouTube Shorts to their list of tactics and scaled up the best-performing assets.Â\n\nOnce tests began, the team quickly discovered that UGC-style ads drove 140% more sourced units indicating its effectiveness at driving product trials or purchases. The YouTube Shorts test group saw 57% higher impressions with 36% more efficient CPM vs. the control. The sourced ARR of the test group was also 132% higher, indicating that the creator-led ads generated more revenue than the control group.",

The model outputs forecasts in various forms based on those inputs.\n\nFor the modelâs first big test, Filson used the model to predict their e-commerce sales for the 2023 Holiday Season.\n\nThe teams compared forecasts to actuals a few months into the Holiday Season and were delighted to learn that they were very precise, with one month forecasted at 99.6% of the actual. Other months were forecasted within a few percentage points. The teams also learned even more ways to improve the models accuracy in future time periods."

So bamboo trees aren’t good for producing more shoots (you plant one and you get one back).\n\nIf you want shoots, mystery islands or trading are your best bet.

Google tells me it's been in PA for a decade or so. It loves to grow alongside streams, which made me think of it. Whether or not it is \"native\" to Pennsylvania is a philosophical question -- it wasn't there 200 (or 20) years ago, but it will naturally and inevitably spread north as the local climate becomes more suitable for it, as will many other Southeastern species.\n\nAs to your original question, in NC nothing native out-competes river cane, but a lot of things can grow alongside it. (And of course your bamboo might be something completely different.)\n\nEDIT: Google also tells me that rough horsetail (*Equisetum hyemale*) is bamboo-like, native to Pennsylvania, and very aggressive.

I take a sawzall right down as close to the ground as I can get and immediately treat the stump. Cutting alone will also help to slow growth.\n\nIf you're cutting, you want to try to get as close to the ground because what's left will be a serious trip hazard, especially if working in the area with tools. I honestly scoot around on my butt for ease and safety because I've tripped a few times and my bamboo is on top of a retaining wall. If you cut too high it can also leave a cup that water accumulates in and is perfect for mosquito larva. \n\nIf it's running bamboo, there will be significant material underground. It's not easy to remove in my experience as it's thick and rigid and intertwined, but maybe that's just me. I'm trying to wait it out and see what happens over winter and if it's any easier to dig out next summer, but best bet would be to excavate it out. I mention this because it may impact your ability to plant in the area for a while if you can't dig through the roots, or if you need to bring heavy equipment. \n\nI'm just shy of 2 years with my bamboo and I'm told to expect to deal with it for many more. I'm expecting consistent supervision of the area for years to catch any new growth early and to prep the ground for replanting.\n\n## Comment ID kinr150 with +2 score by [(PM_ME_TUS_GRILLOS, Reddit, 2024-01-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NativePlantGardening/comments/19aj2nb/native_plant_that_outcompetes_bamboo/kinr150/) (in reply to ID 19aj2nb):\nI think you have enough advice about eradication already (herbicide ftw). \n\n\nIf you grow veggies or vines, bamboo canes can be used to make trellises or fences.

That’s one of bamboo’s more exciting properties, it will put out a cane, which will reach its full height within 2-3 months and then never grow in height again, only putting out branches. Clumps of bamboo reach their full size by each year sending out successively taller shoots. Clumping bamboo definitely requires less maintenance than running bamboo in terms of keeping it contained, but it will still need water sometimes, especially in its first year. I’d recommend waiting until fall before planting, it’s a lot harder on the plant to try and get established in the heat of summer. And bamboo naturally lose leaves throughout the year, it lets them form a natural mulch. I’m not sure if there are any bamboo species that could endure a mega-drought without help. Fertilizer needs will depend on your soil.\n\n## Comment ID h3m8bch with +1 score by [(fifasol, Reddit, 2021-06-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bamboo/comments/oaj5tp/what_type_of_bamboo_species_can_grow_best_in/h3m8bch/) (in reply to ID oaj5tp):\nIm in socal, but near the coast.

And most spreading bamboos only occupy the first foot of the soil. \n\nTo remove; take a reciprocating saw with a pruning blade and cut into the soil in a grid pattern (make sure there are no pipes or wires first on or in the soil). Then pop out the clumps with a shovel. (Which should expose the rhizomes in the underside of the clumps.) After you get it all up (by following the rhizomes cutting in a grid), reapply your desired soil in the worked area.\n\nIf you kept the canes uncut, you would now have bamboo divisions for your bamboo loving friends (like me!) The canes on the edge of the Grove are the best divisions as long as they are 3-6 months old.\n\nTo control spreading bamboo; you take into account the top 1' to 2' of soil (as it habitates the top foot of soil) and dig either a 1'-2' deep trench around where you want it to colonize. (As bamboo is awful at adjusting for height, and will poke out the side rather then going under. Just prune off what pokes through). Or dig in a bamboo barrier around where you want it contained.\n\nBamboo is a super sequestrator by the by, and has a use sequestering carbon to fight climate change. And if no inorganic fertilizers are used it feeds mycelial networks too! Plus you can use it to make bio-char!\n\nHope you all found this helpful!\n\n## Comment ID hpjn68i with +7 score by [(Peajy, Reddit, 2021-12-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/rm3bgc/should_i_let_bamboo_take_over_this_part_of_the/hpjn68i/) (in reply to ID rm3bgc):\nBamboo is beautiful, it is also extremely hard wearing and will take over if left to it’s own accord.

I recently had some clumping bamboo planted in my backyard and want to intersperse some other plants on the ground. Each bamboo is spaced about six feet apart and the barrier is about two feet wide. The plants will be on the same irrigation as the bamboo, aka will gets lots of water. There’s also direct light for a couple hours each day, but the plants will be heavily shadowed by the bamboo and two trees I have. I’d love something that flowers, but my priority is something that will thrive. I’m a somewhat novice gardener so hopefully nothing too temperamental.

I learned from my neighbor that the bamboo had originated 4 houses down the block and had even crossed the alley at one point.  I ended up having to knock on doors so that all 6 homeowners with infested yards could cut down their bamboo and treat the stumps at the same time.  One homeowner was elderly and too poor to hire anyone to get rid of it; another was a landlord who didn't care.  The other homeowners pitched in to get rid of it in their yards \n\nI spent hours and hours over 4 months getting rid of the bamboo in my yard and in the alley behind my house, an area that was probably 40'×45' of solid bamboo.  By the time I was done getting rid of it, I had carpal tunnel in both hands and had trigger fingers in all my fingers except my left pinky.  The inflammation got so bad I had to go on prednisone for several weeks.  Even after cutting down all the existing stalks, it took 3 more years of destroying the new growth after every rain before it was completely gone.\n\nThe reason I typed all this up is to illustrate how serious I am when I say that if I were your neighbor I would hate your guts and would seek out every legal remedy I could, including filing a lawsuit.\n\n## Comment ID isw6k6r with +9 score by [(hotttsauce84, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AustinGardening/comments/y7ev5y/best_plants_to_coplantcompanion_plant_with_bamboo/isw6k6r/) (in reply to ID y7ev5y):\nI know you probably don’t want to hear this because it’s likely you spent money to have that bamboo planted, but as others have said, remove it immediately.

They will hide the fence when the bamboo grows tall. Think leafy w open habit (not leggy, tho) vs tight, manicured small leaf like, say, a boxwood.

I'd go with Variegated Mondo Grass (Ophiopogon jaburan ‘Vittatus’).  The variegation will bring the bamboo depth of field closer to the eye. But, since you have a small lot, Black Mondo Grass (Ophiopogon planiscapus ‘Nigrescens’), sometimes labeled as \"Black Dragon' will offer greater depth of field. Either will offer even greater attention to the canes than the lawn alone. However, teh Black Dragon will make the back of the property dark when you already have dark green evergreens along each fence side.    I would not use the variety 'Nana' as it will mimic the high turf getting lost in the process.\n\nAnother option is Japanese Forest Grass Hakonechloa macra \"Aureola'  [http://www.enchantedgardensdesign.com/blog/2018/9/7/hakone-grass-a-four-season-perennial](http://www.enchantedgardensdesign.com/blog/2018/9/7/hakone-grass-a-four-season-perennial).\n\nYet other options are Variegated Japanese Sedge(Carex morrowii 'Aurea-variegata') [https://www.monrovia.com/variegated-japanese-sedge.html](https://www.monrovia.com/variegated-japanese-sedge.html) and Carex oshimensis 'Evergold' [https://www.waltersgardens.com/variety.php?ID=CAREV](https://www.waltersgardens.com/variety.php?ID=CAREV) and Carex morrowii 'Ice Dance' [https://www.monrovia.com/ice-dance-japanese-sedge.html#:\\~:text=Carex%20morrowii%20'Ice%20Dance'&text=A%20lush%20mound%20of%20slender,growing%2C%20non%2Dinvasive%20groundcover](https://www.monrovia.com/ice-dance-japanese-sedge.html#:~:text=Carex%20morrowii%20'Ice%20Dance'&text=A%20lush%20mound%20of%20slender,growing%2C%20non%2Dinvasive%20groundcover).\n\nI also LOVE the idea of a sitting boulder, maybe two, very organic, not formal, maybe one boulder with a depression that holds water,  sandwiched within the bamboo as who doesn't like sitting on a boulder in a grove of bamboo? The boulder, or two, now becomes a destination which I like for your contemplation space.\n\nBamboo looks like Bambusa multiplex 'Golden Goddess'. It will be a striking 8-12 ft high screen if it is! PLEASE don't shear the tops into a formal hedge. Your on center spacing is fine for this well behaved clumping bamboo. NO need to remove every other one. This is a bamboo variety I've used for a privacy screen similar to your design many times. It starts getting cold sensitive around 28\\*. Although it could be a Fargesia. F. robusta, the straight species, maybe? Again, if it is F. robusta you're OK too on the spacing. It gets a bit taller than  Golden Goddess though.

As large as you can afford. Shoot for 5: 2x 3'x3', 2x 2'x2', and 1 about the size of a basketball. \n\nThe same rules apply outside as they do inside: All of Granny's dolls, Hummel figurines and dishes lining every shelf looks cluttered.

I have hostas that get direct morning and noon sun, then indirect the rest of the day and they do pretty well. They don't get huge, but they're healthy and put up with my careless lawnmowing habits without a problem.  I think you could find a hosta variety that would do ok for you.

It won’t shoot out randomly in the middle of the yard, just expand a few inches radially every year. Will probably start screwing up the grass in 5 years or so, and it’ll require digging out the roots to resize it. A huge PITA, especially if the ground is clay, but not impossible like running bamboo.

Im thinking of making my lawn smaller by about 1/3 in front of my bamboo so it will be mulched. Debating whether I should plant anything in front of it after making Lawn smaller.

Moss poles require constant moisture to actually be useful which requires multiple waterings a week which requires messing with plants when we all got shit to do, yo.\n\nI buy bundles of 4 foot bamboo sticks that I cut for whatever size range. I’ve started to standardize my cuts based on my space and plant pot sizes. Once plants start to get really big in 5-6inch pots at about 2-3 feet tall, I use larger 6 foot thicker bamboo poles. My plants are all climbing like crazy and throwing out larger, more mature leaves and I’m happy as can be. They are easier to move around with poles vs those big moss things, aren’t tipsy and are extremely cost effective.\n\nYour syngonium does not need a moss pole. It could be beneficial to stake it with a bamboo pole and you will have more time and money to spend on more plants going this route.\n\nSide note, people say “I like that natural look” of the pole and I hear you. My counter to that is That you can play with using multiple bamboo poles in various ways to really highlight the plants form in a way that a single moss pole can’t.  You also don’t have to deal with constant moss mess everywhere. You can also use natural sticks that have more organic looks to the setup in certain situations (depends on tree type, plant type and not recommend for long term staking).\n\nHope this helps and good luck!\n\n### Comment ID ixxglaa with +5 score by [(SouthsidePlantDaddy, Reddit, 2022-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Syngonium/comments/z5fgkp/moss_poles_for_syngs_yes_or_no/ixxglaa/) (in reply to ID ixvszo5):\nI disagree. The reason you don’t see suppliers using sphagnum moss poles is because sphagnum   Is expensive and there is no reason for them to invest that amount of resources (the time to attach/monitor the plant on the pole and the overhead cost) if it’s ultimately no an aesthetic the consumer may even want. They send them out unstaked because it is then up to you to do with them what you will. \n\nI 100% think you should use a sphagnum pole. I have all of my aroids on them and will never stop using them. Unless you are more interested in draping plants, I can’t see a reason not to use them. The plants grow faster and larger, fewer chances of under watering or over watering, more humidity in the area around the pole, ideal support, and they just look great! \n\nI’ve never seen someone make a pole the way you have, but that would be an incredibly useful way to propagate. You can just open up the pole and clean away the sphagnum. I use cylinder poles, so when I propagate a plant that’s grown on the pole, I have to work the roots back through the holes of the actual pole. I may steal this for my propagation plants.

They used clear plastic, I just used what I had. It was particularly tricky getting it to stay stable in the pot. Maybe I overstuffed it w moss and it was too heavy? I don’t know. \n\nI have now gone down the rabbithole and see people are chucking their moss poles for plain wood planks. I may do that with some of my pothos for kicks.\n\n### Comment ID ixvykbv with +2 score by [(Embarrassed_Ad_2377, Reddit, 2022-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Syngonium/comments/z5fgkp/moss_poles_for_syngs_yes_or_no/ixvykbv/) (in reply to ID ixvszo5):\nVery very helpful thanks.

You keep your humidity up and that encourages airroots who grow no matter what and if they want they can attach to bamboo but the whole point is less focus on constantly keeping things moist for plants that probably aren’t going to be worth the energy to put in a second root set like a albo syngonium. The poles are just their to help hold the stems up via tie ups but that’s about it. \n\nThe difference is a mosspole takes a ton of pot real estate, takes a ton of resources to put together and if you are keeping both dry, then probably it’s worth going the simplest, cheapest way which is just bamboo.\n\n### Comment ID lo269gk with +1 score by [(The_best_is_yet, Reddit, 2024-09-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Syngonium/comments/z5fgkp/moss_poles_for_syngs_yes_or_no/lo269gk/) (in reply to ID ixvszo5):\nthank you for sharing this!

They just need something for the air roots to cling too. Extensions are easy, when using stackable poles. No fuss. However, I have found moss better for my climbing philos and once I mastered the care, relatively easy and less messy. Although I will have to train my house sitter, either she will embrace it or throw them all out 🤣😲😱\n\n### Comment ID ixxosq4 with +2 score by [(Embarrassed_Ad_2377, Reddit, 2022-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Syngonium/comments/z5fgkp/moss_poles_for_syngs_yes_or_no/ixxosq4/) (in reply to ID ixwompa):\nYeah I think tomorrow I will undo the pole on the white butterfly- it isn’t tall enough and its doing nothing for the plant.

BUT... they are both on loooong single, kinda thin, main stems. I have been intrigued watching the Leca Queen and others on YT with their moss poles.   \nToday I took the plunge and made 2 (wonky) moss poles for these syngs, and repottted them. I also chopped the WB.  \nI am scared because the moss poles seem all wrong. I made them from a plastic mesh (I couldn't find any wire square or plastic squares like the one she used) I made like a \"u\" shape, I had seen this done with clear plastic- and it has the side towards the stem open. The thing is, they don't seem tall enough. To make sure the pot didn't tip over (that moss got so heavy when wet!) I had to use a larger pot than I wanted...  \nNow I am stressing because the stem is against the damp moss, and especially my WB doesn't have too many nodes along that part of the stem. The moss pole wasn't nearly tall enough. It looks dumb.  \nWill the nodes from the bare stem grow into the moss? What do you do as it grows, this pole can end up being 8 ft tall!  \nI also see some people just let their syngs vine, how is this done without the plant getting all top-heavy and snapping?  \nAlso, I don't personally like the look of the 3-lobed mature leaf. How do you prevent those from happening?  \nUgh- I think I prematurely thought the moss pole was going to be the answer to these plants growing larger and larger, but now a. I'm not even sure I LIKE moss poles, and b. I'm afraid I did something to make these plants stress out and die.  \nAnyone with experience, let me know what you did!\n\n## Comment ID ixvtouq with +3 score by [(Reveal_Simple, Reddit, 2022-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Syngonium/comments/z5fgkp/moss_poles_for_syngs_yes_or_no/ixvtouq/) (in reply to ID z5fgkp):\nCheck out “lazy moss poles” by unplantparenthood on YouTube.\nAlso what are your goals for the plant?

It sounds like you worked here in the early days of the creative team when it was separated as an R&amp;D effort, but you'll be happy to know that is no longer the case. Creative team members are integrated into account teams now and are extremely central to what we do! \n\n2. I am no longer involved in sales and I definitely agree with your critique. Account teams are now involved pre-sale for the clients they would be owning and it's going a lot smoother as a result!\n\n3. The \"group project\" call out is fair, though I think that was mostly due to our matrixed org structure. It made things difficult for us as we outgrew it. It was often unclear who the one person responsible for various things were. Too many approvals and too much consensus was required. We're now reorganizing into pods to fix this empower more leaders across the business. Definitely agree and understand this critique from the past though!\n\n4. The one thing I have to call out is that we are not and have never been \"a revolving door of clients\". We have very strong client retention and that has always been the case. I'm not sure if this happened on your clients specifically but I want to assure future team members and clients that this is not the case.\n\nThanks for what you put into Bamboo and again, I hope you found a better fit!",

It's a young company and management is always seeking input on ways to improve (see the detailed and sincere responses to the negative reviews for examples), but will also invest heavily in helping its people to grow in their role and intended career path. Even when debating whether to leave to pursue a dream career change, everyone was very supportive and positive. Bamboo really celebrates the accomplishments of all its employees (current and former) out of genuine care.\r\n\r\nFairly solid benefits in terms of health, dental, and vision, with stock options, flexible PTO (and you are actually encouraged to use it) and a generous but reasonable work from home policy. The work-life balance is also very good. \r\nMinor perks include a lounge stocked with snacks and a rotating schedule for people to bring their dogs into the office - as long as they're well behaved. \r\n\r\nThe team environment is great. Everyone is very friendly and casual and tries to make the day enjoyable, though will also be respectful and professional where needed. Management works hard to resolve even minor interpersonal conflicts from differences in work style so that everyone is content. There are many opportunities to connect with others inside and outside of work, though no major peer pressure as can sometimes occur at startups or in agency environments. Even during the pandemic, Bamboo did its best to attend to employee needs and set up virtual social events, from yoga and workouts to language lessons to involved happy hours.",

Even when debating whether to leave to pursue a dream career change, everyone was very supportive and positive. Bamboo really celebrates the accomplishments of all its employees (current and former) out of genuine care.\r\n\r\nFairly solid benefits in terms of health, dental, and vision, with stock options, flexible PTO (and you are actually encouraged to use it) and a generous but reasonable work from home policy. The work-life balance is also very good. \r\nMinor perks include a lounge stocked with snacks and a rotating schedule for people to bring their dogs into the office - as long as they're well behaved. \r\n\r\nThe team environment is great. Everyone is very friendly and casual and tries to make the day enjoyable, though will also be respectful and professional where needed. Management works hard to resolve even minor interpersonal conflicts from differences in work style so that everyone is content. There are many opportunities to connect with others inside and outside of work, though no major peer pressure as can sometimes occur at startups or in agency environments. Even during the pandemic, Bamboo did its best to attend to employee needs and set up virtual social events, from yoga and workouts to language lessons to involved happy hours.",

      "# [Japanese Knotweed vs Bamboo: Differences and Similarities on 2019-07-13](https://www.japaneseknotweedspecialists.com/news/japanese-knotweed-vs-bamboo)\nJapanese knotweed and bamboo have many things in common: theyâre both ornamental plants and theyâre also incredibly invasive. Unfortunately, when left to grow and spread, these plants are responsible for considerable damage, amounting to thousands in repairs for homeowners and taxpayers.\n\nAllowing Japanese knotweed to spread into neighbouring properties or the countryside could also carry significant fines and penalties. Itâs so invasive itâs been known to kill other ecological systems and destroy vegetation plots. Whilst thereâs no legislation in place to control bamboo, it is also capable of causing structural damage to buildings. Thatâs why, itâs more important than ever to get these plants under control and ensure they canât spread.\n\nJapanese Knotweed vs Bamboo: Why Are They Invasive?\n\nDespite their ornamental appeal, both Japanese knotweed and bamboo can cause serious damage in and around the areas they grow. Unfortunately, their ability to spread, as well as their tough and thick root structures, make them both invasive species.\n\nItâs true that bamboo and Japanese knotweed have been popular fixtures within domestic gardens, and we can thank the curiosity of the Victorian upper classes for this alone. During the Victorian era, understanding new species, as well as botany and plant cultivation, piqued the interest of many households. And, just like a fashion trend, as the plants were displayed to family, friends and fellow aristocrats, their popularity grew. Â\n\nWhat are the Differences Between Japanese Knotweed and Bamboo?\n\nAs invasive species, Japanese knotweed and bamboo have some stark similarities and differences. Although they can both wreak havoc on homes, ecological systems and vital infrastructure, they also have key distinctive features to help tell them apart.\n\nJapanese Knotweed\n\nStems\n\nUpon a quick glance, the stems of a Japanese knotweed plant might appear like those of a bamboo. As it grows to full size, the stems also feature ridges and a slight zig-zag growth pattern as bamboo.\n\nFlowers\n\nAlongside their shovel-shaped leaves, Japanese knotweed plants are accompanied by clusters of creamy white flowers. These typically come through in the summer months, with the plants in flower around August to September months. The flowers are also quite similar to those on Himalayan knotweed.\n\nLeaves\n\nDescribed as either heart or shovel-shaped, the leaves on a Japanese knotweed plant differ from those shown on bamboo. With a much wider surface area, the plantâs leaves are also a much darker green in comparison. Japanese knotweed also loses its leaves in the autumn and winter months.\n\nShoots\n\nThe shoots of a Japanese knotweed plant look slightly like asparagus spears but can be easily told apart by their colouring. Infant Japanese knotweed is often a reddish-brown before it develops. Typically, Japanese knotweed tends to grow where hollow or dead stems lay on the ground.\n\nRoots\n\nStrong and often clustered, the roots of a Japanese knotweed plant are also known as rhizomes. They are hardy enough to grow almost everywhere and can appear tough as they cluster under the ground. As the plants are invasive, they only require 0.2g of their rhizome to survive a culling, meaning they can easily grow again.\n\nBamboo\n\nStems\n\nOne of the most notable characteristics of a bamboo plant is its stems. Cylindrical in shape, the stems also feature small ridges which are also known as nodes, and are designed to strengthen the stem as it grows.\n\nFlowers\n\nFlowering on a bamboo plant is quite a rare occurrence and can happen once every 65-120 years. However, this frequency is dependent on the species of bamboo growing. Bamboo plants known to flower, such as clumping or running bamboo, also drop their seeds during different seasons.\n\nLeaves\n\nOne of the most notable differences between the two plants is the leaf structure. Bamboo has narrower leaves compared to Japanese knotweed. They descend into a pointed shape that is similar to grass and are normally symmetrical. Unlike Japanese knotweed, bamboo normally retains its leaves.\n\nShoots\n\nDespite their pointed tips, the base of bamboo has more girth compared to that of Japanese knotweed. Its exterior is best described as woody and thick, preserving it as it grows. Whatâs more, bamboo shoots are often harvested and enjoyed as Asian cuisine.\n\nRoots\n\nBamboo roots can spread evenly and can grow up to 20 feet away from the main base of the plant. Unfortunately, this can mean damage to nearby properties or infrastructure as they can easily grow beneath driveways and house foundations. Thatâs why bamboo root structures need to be checked frequently and treated if required.\n\nHow Were They Introduced to the UK? Â\n\nItâs no surprise that we have our Victorian ancestors to blame for introducing both plants to the country. However, they crossed British waters and entered domestic properties within different decades.\n\nJapanese Knotweedâs Introduction to the UK Â\n\nAs European countries explored more Asian territories, they brought back certain marvels that didnât exist within British culture or British life. These fascinations, especially for botanical studies, led to the plant being introduced in 1850 by a German botanist. Â\n\nJapanese knotweed had already made a name for itself three years prior in The Netherlands being coined âthe most interesting new ornamental plant of the yearâ by the Society of Agriculture and Horticulture. Of course, hindsight is a great thing.\n\nBambooâs Introduction to the UK\n\nAlmost 25 years prior to Japanese knotweed crossing British waters, bamboo arrived at Kew Gardens in 1826. During the Victorian era, there was a huge obsession for plant-hunting with keen botanists eager to introduce new species, learn them and understand their anatomy. Â\n\nIntroducing this species was trial and error. Botanists couldnât determine whether the plant would survive the climate or thrive within the soil. At the time, it was sent to separate centres and places within the country to see if it could survive.\n\nWhat Damage Has Been Caused By Japanese Knotweed and Bamboo?\n\nUnsupervised and unchecked invasive plants have a tendency to cause major disruption and damage. From overhead cabling to building foundations, Japanese knotweed and bamboo are notorious for costing taxpayers in excess of Â£246.5 million each year. In fact, Japanese knotweed is the most expensive invasive species on Britainâs shores. Â\n\nJapanese Knotweed Damage\n\nJapanese knotweed is strong enough to penetrate cracks in foundations and can grow through them, causing damage to walls, properties and infrastructure. Itâs strong enough to gradually lift paving slabs, creating trip hazards for visitors or walkers. Whatâs more, it can also cause blockages in drainage pipes as itâs capable of growing and spreading underground.\n\nBamboo Damage\n\nIntroduced as decorative plants for the garden, bamboo can also wreak havoc on a domestic property. Not only can it push through any cracks or gaps in bricks, causing damage to driveways and foundation walls, but it has also led to an increase in nuisance claims for mortgage lenders. It has the potential to restrict lenders from supplying mortgages for properties infested by bamboo.\n\nWhat Legislation is in Place?\n\nBamboo Legislation\n\nUnlike Japanese knotweed, bamboo is not covered under any legislation making it neither illegal to own or allow the plant to spread. However, that doesnât mean its consequence free. Some households have reported the plant costing them damage in excess of Â£100,000. Itâs believed that some mortgage lenders may also restrict borrowing if your home is infested with bamboo.\n\nJapanese Knotweed Legislation\n\nAlthough itâs not illegal to have Japanese knotweed on your property, it is illegal to allow it to spread out to neighbouring properties. As the plant causes significant damage, if you allow it to spread and are unable to control it, you may be liable under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, as well as the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 and the Environmental Protection Act 1990.\n\nHow Should Japanese Knotweed and Bamboo Be Removed?\n\nFor proper removal and disposal, itâs always best case to employ specialists. Invasive plant specialists are able to fully manage and assess the threat both Japanese knotweed and bamboo pose. In many cases, they may also offer a guarantee in the event regrowth happens.\n\nDepending on the level of infestation and how much soil has been contaminated, there are a number of possibilities when it comes to the removal of both plants. They should be meticulously and cautiously removed to avoid their respreading. For example, Japanese knotweed plants can thrive when just 0.2g of rhizome is left behind.\n\nMethods for removal may include:\n\nExcavation tactics\n\nBurning\n\nHerbicide and spraying\n\nOff-site removal (with a licenced carrier)\n\nThink You Might Have an Invasive Species on Your Property?\n\nIf you believe either bamboo, Japanese knotweed or buddleia is growing on your property, you may want to take action sooner rather than later. At Japanese Knotweed Specialists, weâre able to identify, risk assess and remove both plants, whilst offering you a guarantee in case of regrowth. Contact us today.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ",

      "# [How To Grow And Care For Bamboo by Steve Bender, www.facebook.com on 2016-11-11](https://www.southernliving.com/garden/perennials/how-to-grow-bamboo)\nBamboo (Bambusa vulgaris) is an evergreen perennial that grows in running and clumping formations. Running bamboo spreads faster than the clumping variety, making it highly invasive in environments where the growth goes unchecked. Native to Asia, this tropical and sub-tropical plant has several cultivar varieties.\n\nThe thick stems grow vertically in loose clumps but do not contain any thorns. Relatively strong, the common bamboo has yellow stems, or culms, with dark green foliage that emerges new in the spring. The continuous foliage and quick growth rate make common bamboo an excellent option as a privacy hedge. Plant in late spring or early fall.\n\nNote that raw bamboo culms and leaves contain toxins and people shouldn't eat them raw. However, there are specific varieties whose young shoots are edible and are considered non-toxic to pets and people.\n\nPlant Attributes\n\nBamboo Care\n\nPlant container-grown bamboo any time of year. Clumping bamboo often requires a barrier or garden stakes on one side to help the plant adjust to the desired shape as it grows in an enlarging circle. Use this variety away from fences or sidewalks and maintain its invasive spread by breaking off new shoots when the growth exceeds its space.\n\nLarge expanses of concrete or asphalt won't prevent the spread of running bamboo, but it isn't difficult to contain them—provided you understand how they grow. Rhizomes are shallow and spread sideways, not down. To prevent the horizontal spread of bamboo, block, cut, or surround the rhizomes with a trench.\n\nBamboo needs consistent watering and fertilizer while establishing and growing. Keep the soil moist but well-drained, and amend it with rich, fertile nutrients if required.\n\nLight\n\nCommon bamboo needs daily sun exposure to grow to its fullest potential. Provide plants with at least six hours of sunlight daily in moderately warm areas. In areas with harsher summer climates, the partial shade will provide bamboo with some relief from the afternoon sun. Bamboo grows well in environments with ample light and humidity.\n\nSoil\n\nBamboo thrives in moist, well-drained soil but will tolerate most soil types as long as it is not soggy or too dry. Use a slightly acid soil pH and balance the soil's nutrients with fertilizer if necessary. If growing bamboo in containers, use potting soil with organic compost, such as mushrooms.\n\nWater\n\nWater bamboo frequently and deeply for best growth and wet the soil around the plant to a few inches deep. Established plants tolerate considerable drought but look best with regular irrigation. If grown indoors, use a spray bottle to help amplify the humidity surrounding the bamboo.\n\nTemperature and Humidity\n\nNative to tropical and sub-tropical environments, bamboo grows best in humid areas with moist soil. Common bamboo grows naturally near river banks and open ground and tolerates various climate conditions. Depending on the variety, bamboo will defoliate during the dry season and grow new foliage during the rainy season or spring. Optimal temperatures range from 65°F to 90°F, but a cold-hardy bamboo variety can tolerate temperatures near 10°F.\n\nFertilizer\n\nFeed in-ground plants monthly, from March to October, with a high-nitrogen fertilizer or lawn fertilizer. Using a balanced fertilizer throughout the growing season helps plants to provide nutrients to the roots and keeps the bamboo healthy. Cut back on water and fertilizer to restrict the size and spread of an established bamboo.\n\nTypes of Bamboo\n\nThere is a diverse variety of bamboo to grow in gardens or containers. Depending on your space availability and growing environment, some species are better suited for different conditions. Here are only a few of the available selections:\n\n'Buddha's Belly' (Bambusa ventricosa): This plant grows well indoors, reaching about 5 to 8 feet tall in a container. It is adaptable to various conditions, and the culms grow in a unique, zigzagging formation.\n\n'Chilean Bamboo' (Chusquea culeou): Native to Latin America, this species has solid culms that grow up to 20 feet. This variety's solid stems make it an excellent option for a privacy screen or to use as a focal point in your garden.\n\n'Broad-leaf Bamboo' (Sasa Palmata): A tropical, running bamboo species with highly resilient growth, this plant tolerates shady environments.\n\n'Blue Bamboo' (Himalayacalamus hookerianus): This evergreen, clump-forming bamboo has slender and elegant culms, each containing a hint of red or purple coloring on top of its blue stems that mature to gold.\n\nPruning\n\nPrune bamboo any time during the year, but prevent accidentally removing emerging shoots during the growing season. Much of the pruning needed for bamboo plants is to maintain shape and appearance. Start by removing older, dead, or unsightly culms with a saw or sharp garden shears. Remove these unwanted culms to the ground, or cut above the node if you are pruning for appearance.\n\nDepending on the bamboo variety, running bamboo species must block the plant's surrounding area to avoid unwanted spread. A continuous polypropylene plastic sheet around the perimeter of the planting helps to block the space, but remember to keep a 2-inch lip above ground to stop runners. Never place plastic under roots, as they need excellent drainage. Continuously drying the soil, extending 10 to 20 feet beyond the planting bed, impedes runners.\n\nAnother effective pruning solution is to periodically insert a spade to its full length around the plant, severing the rhizomes and isolating unwanted parts from the main plant. Break off new shoots that rise from the isolated rhizomes, so they are unlikely to resprout. Surrounding the plant with an 18-inch deep and 1-foot wide trench can provide an opening to remove any emerging rhizomes. Fill the trench with loose mulch or sand, then use a spading fork several times a year to search the trench for roving rhizomes and easily sever.\n\nPropagating Bamboo\n\nThe best time to propagate bamboo from existing clumps is just before growth begins in the spring. Here is how to propagate bamboo by dividing culms or rhizome cuttings:\n\nDuring March or April (for hardy varieties) or May or early June (for tropical varieties), roots with at least three culms are divided using a sharp pruning shear or spade. Do not cut or spread the root ball, which will kill the canes.\n\nCut back the tops to balance the loss of roots and rhizomes. Don't worry if the foliage wilts because new growth will emerge from the missing culms.\n\nIf propagating from a clumping bamboo species, cut the rhizome with a garden spade from the root ball. Running bamboo will have a foot-long rhizome with roots and buds.\n\nAfter removing the section of bamboo from cuttings or the root ball, plant the new divisions in rich soil filled with organic material. Continue watering and maintain a moist, well-drained growing environment.\n\nHow to Grow Bamboo From Seed\n\nGrowing bamboo from seeds is challenging but possible in the right conditions. Here is how to grow bamboo from seeds:\n\nBamboo seeds need humidity to grow, so create a greenhouse if you do not own one. Start with a seed tray, bamboo seeds, pellets, and a container large enough to enclose the tray—creating a greenhouse atmosphere.\n\nFill each spot in the seed starting tray with a pellet and add water to cover it, filling the individual containers about halfway. Use clean water and let the pellets soak until expanding. Remove excess water.\n\nFill a container with clean water and submerge the bamboo seeds for up to 24 hours. Keep the seeds in a warm area.\n\nUse a pencil or fingers to create a hole in each pellet, which will plant one seed in each area. Make sure the seeds are completely covered. Place in a room with indirect sunlight and keep pellets moist. Continue care until sprouts reach the greenhouse container's top, then transplant them into a larger container to grow until it's time to move the plant outdoors.\n\nPotting and Repotting Bamboo\n\nWhen growing bamboo in a container, it might be necessary to repot the plant once it outgrows its current space. As an aggressive spreader, bamboo—especially running bamboo—can quickly overgrow if not maintained.\n\nStart with a sturdy, well-draining container with similar depth and width. Fill the container with rich potting soil, enough to cover the top of the root ball. Transplant the root ball in the new container, but do not pack the plant too deeply, as this can cause rot. Leave air pockets in the soil and water thoroughly. Depending on your preferences, continue repotting bamboo or gently divide the rhizomes to maintain shape and appearance.\n\nOverwintering\n\nAfter establishing growth, bamboo plants are relatively cold-hardy in USDA Zones 4-10. Planting bamboo in the spring is best to allow culms to emerge and take root before experiencing colder conditions. Adding mulch to the plant during its first winter season is recommended when planted outdoors. If using a container to grow bamboo, move the plant indoors before the first frost.\n\nCommon Pests & Plant Diseases\n\nScale, mealybugs, and aphids occasionally appear on bamboo but seldom do any harm. Spray with insecticidal soap or summer oil if these pests excrete honeydew in bothersome amounts. Mites can cause yellow streaking or disfigurement of leaves, which insecticidal soap can also control.\n\nRoot rot can occur in bamboo plants that do not have adequate circulation or wet growing environments. This soil-borne disease causes roots to appear darker or slimy. Use a sharp knife to remove damaged or mushy roots and prevent spreading by eliminating the culms above. Water the plant's base in the morning to prevent foliage from developing a fungus.\n\nCommon Problems With Bamboo\n\nBamboo plants are relatively free from problems and only require some maintenance. Your bamboo plant might need more water, soil nutrients, or sun exposure.\n\nCurling Leaves\n\nAdequate watering balance is one of the most challenging parts of caring for bamboo plants. Curling leaves signify underwatering. Without any other changes, changing the watering schedule is all that's needed to resolve this issue. Water plants once or twice a week at the plant's base. Different conditions, like container plants and harsh summer heat, might require watering more often.\n\nDrooping Leaves\n\nBamboo plants require a lot of nitrogen-rich fertilizer. Use organic compost at the beginning of the growing season in the spring and again in mid to late summer. Extra feeding can help revive the thinning plant when the foliage looks unhealthy. Brown leaves can signify too much fertilizer, so don't overfeed bamboo.\n\nLeaves Turning Brown\n\nToo much direct or harsh sunlight can cause bamboo plants' leaves to turn brown. Overwatering and underwatering can also cause an imbalance in soil nutrients, creating brown leaves. If possible, move bamboo to an area with indirect or filtered sunlight.",

      "# [How to Plant and Grow Golden Bamboo by Hollyanna McCollom, www.facebook.com on 2016-02-18](https://www.bhg.com/gardening/plant-dictionary/shrub/golden-bamboo/)\nGolden bamboo is a perennial with finely textured green leaves and attractive golden-yellow stems. It is considered a running bamboo and is often planted to create privacy between properties because it grows quickly (often as much as 2 to 3 feet per year). It is one of the quickest ways to make a dense hedge or screen without planting fully grown shrubs. It also provides bold vertical interest in landscape beds or the contained space between two driveways.\n\nGolden bamboo is hardy in zones 6 through 10 but is not recommended for all landscapes as it can be hard to control. It is easier to keep in check in northern climates, but it may not be as evergreen in these zones. If temperatures drop to 5 degrees Fahrenheit or below, golden bamboo will likely drop its foliage, and the canes may die—but don't fret. The roots will, most likely, send up new canes in the spring.\n\nWhere to Plant Golden Bamboo\n\nGolden bamboo is native to China but has been grown in the United States since the late 1880s when it was introduced in Alabama. It prefers moist, well-draining soil and thrives in sunny spots where it can get about 6 to 8 hours of sunlight each day. You can also grow golden bamboo in partial shade or poor soil, but the results may be uneven and less robust.\n\nDue to its height, fast growth rate, and abundance, golden bamboo is often grown as a privacy fence or living hedge. Its lush, delicate leaves are great for muffling nearby sounds. When grown in close proximity, its canes knock together and create a pleasant, soothing sound that makes a melodic addition to modern, naturalistic, and Japanese-style gardens.\n\nHow and When to Plant Golden Bamboo\n\nYou can plant golden bamboo in spring or fall; in the right conditions, it will quickly grow to full height and density in just a few years. When planting a nursery-grown golden bamboo plant, dig a hole as deep as the plant's container and twice as wide as the root ball. Place the plant in the hole, then backfill it with soil mixed with mulch. Water deeply. Subsequent waterings should keep the soil moist but not soggy.\n\nInstall root barriers around these perennials when planting them in the landscape unless you are prepared for a seemingly infinite spread. Or plant each one in a large plastic pot sunk into the soil with the rim of the pot extending 3 to 5 inches above the ground. This will help prevent golden bamboo from creeping into the surrounding soil. Space your golden bamboo plants at least 3 to 5 feet apart to accommodate future growth or wider if you want a less dense, airier look.\n\nGolden Bamboo Care Tips\n\nLight\n\nGolden bamboo grows best where it gets full sun for at least six to eight hours a day, though where it gets very hot, some late-afternoon shade is beneficial. It will do fine located in partial shade, but its growth will be slower.\n\nSoil and Water\n\nGolden bamboo is fairly drought tolerant, but optimally, it will have moist, well-drained soil. Keep it watered, but don't let the soil get waterlogged. When the weather is very hot, golden bamboo may need additional watering a few times a week if it's in a container or once a week if it's grown in the ground.\n\nTemperature and Humidity\n\nGolden bamboo thrives in hot and humid areas, but will do fine in less-ideal conditions. It will even grow in cold weather, though not as quickly or as tall as it does where it's warm.\n\nFertilizer\n\nFertilize golden bamboo in early spring and midsummer. In milder climates, it can also be fertilized in early fall. Since golden bamboo is a grass, use a lawn fertilizer that doesn't contain weed killer, following the manufacturer's instructions, or use compost or manure.\n\nPruning\n\nCut away golden bamboo's dead or weak stems periodically after it's established. If it's getting bulky, you can thin it out as needed. To highlight the tortoise-shell coloring of the stalks, remove leaves that grow along the lower portions near the base.\n\nGolden bamboo is tough to eradicate once firmly planted in the ground. Be persistent. Cut plants as close to the ground as possible. Watch for new growth and repeat cutting several times during the growing season as necessary until underground rhizomes die. Chemical herbicides are occasionally effective, too. Follow application directions carefully.\n\nPotting and Repotting Golden Bamboo\n\nAvoid unwanted spreading by planting golden bamboo in a container at least 24 inches deep and wide. The pot should be wood or unglazed terra-cotta with drainage holes at the bottom. Place the pot on a sturdy, impenetrable surface, such as concrete, to prevent the ground from being invaded. After planting, cover the soil surface with two inches of mulch to help it retain moisture. Water a potted golden bamboo three times a week during the summer, more often if the temperature reaches 90°F, so the soil doesn't dry out.\n\nPests and Problems\n\nThe main problems golden bamboo can have are root rot and sooty mold. Sooty mold is caused by pests like mealybugs and aphids. Keep your plants trimmed to allow for air circulation and water at the base, not in the middle, to avoid root rot.\n\nHow to Propagate Golden Bamboo\n\nTo grow golden bamboo from a stem cutting, cut a section of cane about 10 inches long at a 45-degree angle. It should have at least three nodes. After dipping it in rooting hormone, plant the section in quality soil up to the first node. Mist the soil daily and fill the center of the cane with water, periodically refilling it. After a few weeks in bright sunlight, your cane will have grown taller, and it will be ready for planting in a few months.\n\nTypes of Golden Bamboo\n\n'Koi' Golden Bamboo\n\n'Koi' golden bamboo is a rare variety with golden canes with green stripes. The canes have a maximum diameter of less than 2 inches and internodal growth that gives them a knobby appearance. It's a great candidate for container planting and often grows a little slower than other varieties.\n\n‘Albovariegata’ Golden Bamboo\n\nThis type of golden bamboo is a hardy, clumping variety with yellow canes and narrow, yellow-green leaves that sometimes have white stripes. It typically grows from 6 to 30 feet tall and is hardy in zones 6 through 10.\n\n‘Holochrysa’ Golden Bamboo\n\nThe sturdy Holochrysa golden bamboo canes will turn from green to a bright golden color much earlier than other golden bamboo cultivars, especially when grown in ample sunlight. As the Holochrysa reaches heights of 12 to 20 feet, its leaves will stay bright and evergreen, providing a pretty contrast to the yellow canes.\n\nCompanion Plants for Golden Bamboo\n\nAcer Palmatum 'Beni Kawa'\n\nA stunning maple that looks beautiful year-round, the ‘Beni Kawa’ also likes full sun to part shade and moist, well-drained soil. It typically grows to only 15 feet tall and is happy in zones 5 through 9.\n\nHakone Grass\n\nA low-maintenance perennial grass, Hakone grass makes a lovely ground cover for the shadier areas leading up to your bamboo plantings.

      "# [Epic Games: The Complete History and Strategy](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/epic-games)\nBen: Welcome to Season 7 Episode 3 of Acquired. The podcast about great technology companies and the stories and playbooks behind them. Iâm Ben Gilbert.\n\nDavid: Iâm David Rosenthal.\n\nBen: And we are your hosts. For everyone new to the show and for everyone whoâs been with us or a while, itâs been a while since we introduced ourselves. We wanted to tell you a little bit about who we are. I am the co-founder of Pioneer Square Labs in Seattle. We are a startup studio and early-stage venture fund. My background is primarily in founding companies and product management.\n\nDavid: I have been a long time venture capitalist. Iâm currently an independent angel investor and advisor to startups based in San Francisco. I come at things from the venture and investing side.\n\nBen: Most importantly, we are excited to be with you today as peers and practitioners in the industry, diving into stories that we all talk about the water cooler when that was a thing.\n\nDavid: The Zoom cooler.\n\nBen: The Zoom cooler, exactly. Today, we will explore what happens when an idealist has full control over a product with perfect global product-market fit, unbelievable economics, and has the leverage to shape the world to his idealistic will, even (potentially) at the expense of his own business. Today we talk about Epic Games, makers of Fortnite, and the Unreal game engine.\n\nYou probably know of them since Fortnite is an absolute international phenomenon, the most played game in the world, and for parents out thereâthe way Gen Z hangs out with each other, or because they are currently the most credible threat to the worldâs largest companyâApple. Not to mention, of course, the incredible amount of attention Fortnite consumes is a threat to Facebookâs advertising business model. Netflix cites it to its investors as the number threat. Epic is the primary US ally of the quiet Chinese giant, Tencent. But their ambitions expand far beyond any of this, and we canât wait to bring you the full story today.\n\nFor the bootstrappers out there, this may just be the most successful bootstrapping story of all time. Going 22 years from founding before rising a dime of investment, so strap in.\n\nDavid: Incredible. Cannot wait to dive into this one.\n\nBen: As always, if you love Acquired and you want to hone your craft of company building, you should join the community of Acquired Limited Partners. Youâll get access to the LP show where we dive deeper into the fundamentals of company building and investing in addition to our monthly LP calls where we talk with all of you directly. And of course, our Book Club and the Zoom calls that we have with the authors.\n\nOur most recent episode on the LP show was on the fundamentals of venture capital. Discussing how VC firms make their investment decisions. Tune in if thatâs of interest to you as a founder or active or aspiring investors. If you arenât already a limited partner, you can click the link in the show notes or go to acquired.fm/lp. All new listeners get a 7-day free trial.\n\nDavid: We realize tooâwhile weâre introducing and explaining ourselves hereâitâs been a while since weâve talked about why we call this thing the Limited Partner Program. Itâs because limited partners are the folks that give capital to VCs and venture firms and make everything possible. Thatâs what you guys are for us too. You are super special. Everyone who is an LP, we thank you. If you want to become one, canât wait to have you.\n\nBen: Yup. Now, on to our presenting sponsor for all of Season 7, Tiny, and its founder Andrew Wilkinson. Andrew, in the last episode, we talked about the types of companies that you buy to build your portfolio of wonderful internet businesses at Tiny. Why does it make sense for the founders the way that you go about doing this?\n\nAndrew: When you go to talk to private equity, itâs typically a six-month process. Thereâs a lot of renegotiation. Thereâs really brutal diligence. Itâs not a fun experience. The worst part of it is that 60% of the time, it goes nowhere. We try and flip that on its head. We will generally tell people if weâre interested within 2 days, send them an offer within 5, and try and close within 30. We can offer them a full upfront cash out. Thereâs no complex earn-out, weird structures, or anything. The founder can either stay or go. Weâre not going to handcuff them to the radiator, and the company gets to operate as it is.\n\nOur model is to hold companies and folks on profits and keep them for the long-term. Your employees arenât going to get merged into a big larger company, and the business isnât going to get flipped in two or three years. Itâs very attractive to a founder who is proud of what theyâve built and wants their business to persist.\n\nBen: Yeah. If youâll indulge my curiosity, listeners of this show know that every business and every strategy is about tradeoffs. When you say compressed diligence or you say we close super fast, what are the tradeoffs that youâre willing to make, and why can you make those?\n\nAndrew: The private equity model is Iâm going to tell you $100 million and then itâs going to be $30 million and a $70 million earn-out (if youâre lucky). We will just go to you and say, we'll give you $30 million. Here is what makes sense and weâll do it in a short period of time. Iâve compared it to if youâre going to go on a date with somebody and they say itâs really important that youâre Christian. You say youâre Christian on day one and then a month later you say youâre an atheist. Thereâs this ridiculous dance that gets done. We just donât do the dance.\n\nBen: Got it. Thank you for the analogy, and thanks for the insight. If you own a wonderful internet business that you want to sell or you know someone who does, you should get in touch. You can learn more at tinycapital.com or by clicking the link in the show notes. All right listeners, time for our episode on Epic Games.\n\nDavid: Letâs dive in. Before we do, we owe a lot of thank yous on this one on the research to a whole bunch of people who have written a lot, and done a lot of great reporting and analysis of Epic, Apple, Tencentâeverything going on here. Three, in particular, I wanted to call out though. One is Matthew Ball and Jacob Novak who wrote just an awesome six-part primer on Epic and all the dynamics around the company. Weâll link to that in the show notes. Definitely go read that.\n\nSecond is the gaming website, Kotaku did this wonderful interview with Tim Sweeney, the CEO and founder of Epic back in 2011. Nikki was inducted into the Gaming Hall of Fame. Many of the direct quotes that weâre going to use from Tim in this episode are from that interview. And then finally, this is so fun. I finally got a chance to use my favorite non-tech industry podcast out there as a source for an Acquired episode.\n\nBen: Youâve been waiting for this forever.\n\nDavid: Iâd bend those. Iâve been wanting to do this forever. Wizard and the Bruiser. Such an awesome podcast. Itâs basically Acquired for nerd history.\n\nBen: Then what are we?\n\nDavid: Weâre a business nerd history.\n\nBen: Yes. They are more game nerds. I suppose weâre more business nerds.\n\nDavid: Games, anime, and stuff. They did a deep dive episode on Epic last year, which was a super helpful jump-starting our research. Thanks, guys, as always.\n\nBen: And for everyone, weâve put all of our links to every source that we use in the show notes. Feel free to peruse those. A special shout out to Griff in the Acquired Slack at acquired.fm/slack who recommended the Matthew Ball piece that got us started down the rabbit hole of researching this in the first place. Awesome to have listeners help us do some of the research.\n\nDavid: Always great. Weâre going to get to all of the high drama here around Fortnite, Tencent, Apple, the lawsuits, et cetera. As always, on Acquired, we start way back. I think itâs particularly important here because I donât think you can understand whatâs going on or Epic without understanding the man who is its founder and CEOâTim Sweeney.\n\nWho is Tim? He was born in the year 1970 in Potomac, Maryland. He was the third of three brothers, but his older two brothers were much older. One was 10 years older than him, and the other one was 15 years older. While he was the youngest of three brothers, he was probably almost like an only child for a lot of his life. By the time he was in elementary school, both of his brothers were probably in college or out of college at that point.\n\nBen: Yeah. He started programming super young. He was an 11-year-old game programmer.\n\nDavid: Yeah. Itâs all wrapped up in this. His dad worked for the Department of Defense. He worked at the mapping agency as part of the Intelligence Unit where they were creating military maps from satellite imagery doing Palantir and skybox type of stuff back in the day before those companies.\n\nEarly on, young Tim realizes two things about himself. One is that he loves tinkering with the guts of how things work. Both mechanicalâand as we will soon seeâcomputers and technical things. Two is he also actually loves business. This is a pretty rare combination. He becomes just a fantastic engineer and a fantastic business mind.\n\nBut he doesnât love business for the money. This is a man who does not have a lot of use for money. He lives in North Carolina, heâs not married, he doesnât have kids, he doesnât hang out with celebrities. Yeah, he bought a few fancy sports cars and a nice house and stuff. He has talked about it to the Wall Street Journal. He mostly eats Bojangles fried chicken and drinks Diet Coke. He wears cargo pants that he probably buys for about $20.\n\nWhat he does is he writes code and works on Epic. Thatâs what he cares about in life. Itâs just so refreshing seeing that and this man whoâs running such an important internet company versus all the other larger than life tech CEOs out there.\n\nBen: You say he loves business. Heâs more of a business engineer. Heâs not a mogul. Heâs not leveraging every component of his business to give him the most cash. Heâs excited about what business gives you the potential to do in the world. It isnât bringing an engineering mindset to the business or a tinkererâs mindset.\n\nDavid: Heâs now taken most of his wealth and has been applying it to land conservation in North Carolina. Which is just so different than you see from so many people these days.\n\nBen: One more point to just paint the classic computer engineer that is Tim Sweeney as David, you and I both watched this video from 2008 where they interview Tim. Heâs got a sports car and has a nice house. Heâs like, hereâs my dining room. Hereâs my dining room table. Iâve never eaten at it. I mostly go to Burger King. It's everything you would expect from an awesome video game programmer, not a CEO worth $4 billion or $5 billion.\n\nDavid: Totally. How did he get this way? Ben, as you mentioned, when heâs really youngâlike 5 or 6âhe starts tinkering around and disassembling lawn mowers and then building them up into go-karts and racing them around. I feel like his parents must haveâby this point in timeâjust been tired of raising little kids for so many years. Theyâre just like, all right Tim, do whatever you want.\n\nAnd then, a couple of years laterâwhen heâs about 9 or 10 years oldâa video game arcade pops up pretty near his house. This is like the 1980 timeframe. This is Noland Bushnell, the height of Atari just after Pong, but Space Invaders was a thing.\n\nTim becomes super fascinated by this arcade. Eventually, his parents get him an Atari 2600 at home. But itâs not so much because he loves playing the games, although he thinks theyâre interesting. Heâs interested in how they worked and in particular, how the cabinets work. He talks about the Atari 2600 that heâs got. Heâs like, âYeah, I like playing some of the games. But it was a pretty crappy machine compared to the cabinets.â He wanted to know how these things work.\n\nThen, a little bit after this time after he started getting into games and this being his first exposure to computers, he went out to visit his oldest brother Steve, who had moved to San Diego and was working on a startup in the computer industry there at that time. Remember, this is like 1981, 1982, just at the start of the PC revolution. Steve had bought a bunch of brand new IBM PCs that they were using at the company. He shows young, 11-year-old Tim how to use these things, how to program it in BASIC. Timâs like, thatâs it. Heâs found his calling in life.\n\nHe has this great quote, âTrying to build a go-kart, you can spend months on something like that and it never quite works right. But the computer would do exactly what you say. I could write, in just a few hours, a really impressive program. It was the ultimate machine to tinker with. It was love at first sight. From that point on, I tried to dedicate all of the time I had free to learning to do more with computers.â\n\nBen: Which for anyone whoâs a programmer out there knows, the computer always does exactly what youâre telling it, both a gift and a curse. Because if itâs doing the wrong thing, itâs just running the instructions you put in there.\n\nDavid: Tim goes back home from visiting Steve in San Diego. Steve must have been seeing the gleam in his kid brotherâs eye. He buys the family back in Maryland an Apple II. This becomes Timâs obsessions. He starts making games and other programs for it. He estimates that over the next couple of years, he would spend the canonical Malcolm Gladwell 10,000 teaching himself how to program.\n\nThis is whatâs so cool. Remember his dad works for DOD, he has access to early, early proto-internet networking type stuff. He goes on BBS systems from the Apple II and he starts asking questions and learning from folks there everything he needs to know about programming. Heâs completely self-taught and he makes a few games during this time, but he never really shares them with anybody.\n\nA little bit later in high school is when he discovers his second passion for business. As Tim tells the story, itâs when he gets a summer job at a hardware store. The wage that heâs earning at the hardware must have been minimum wage, at the time $4 an hour. Heâs working there and he realizes, wait a minute, no matter how hard I work here or how well I do, Iâm only going to earn $4 an hour for the summer. This is the very programmer engineering mind working at this here. Thereâs got to be a more optimal way I could use my time. Not because I need the money, but just because I could do better.\n\nWhat he decides instead is he sees that there are a bunch of lawn mowing businesses operating in the neighborhood. Itâs summertime, cutting the grass in Maryland. He goes around, he asks these families, how much are you paying your lawn mowing services? Theyâre like, we usually pay $100, $120 for mowing the lawn. And Timâs like, bingo. He quits his job at the hardware store, he undercuts the market by 2X. He charges all the families in the neighborhood $60 to mow their lawns. Although he runs the math and figuresâheâs using his dadâs tractorâthat heâs pulling in about $25 an hour.\n\nBen: That feels like an insanely expensive lawn cutting for the time on the East Coast.\n\nDavid: I know. These must have been pretty big lawns.\n\nBen: Yeah, no kidding.\n\nDavid: Either that or very high willingness to pay.\n\nBen: Yeah, fast-growing lawns.\n\nDavid: Yeah, indeed. He has this great quote. He says, âThatâs when I came to a really clear realization that, by trying harder and striving to find cool business opportunities, you could do far, far better than wage earners, who I was when I was working at the hardware store. At that point, it became really clear to me that there were big opportunities in the world.â Super cool.\n\nAs we said, he ends up going to the University of Maryland, close to home. Heâs not a particularly great student. Heâs spending all of his time on his Apple II and BBS systems. He decides to study mechanical engineering because they have a computer science department there, but he thought that would be a waste of time. He already knows how to program. Heâs going to learn more interesting stuff. He ends up learning a lot of math.\n\nBen: Heâs going to say the math and physics here seem like theyâll come in real handy.\n\nDavid: Seems like theyâll come in handy, yeah. On the side though, heâd kept his lawn mowing business going. And then when he goes to university he says, you know, I might want to try and do something even more lucrative. Iâm an engineering major here. I really have the skill with computers than a lot of people had at the time. What if I start doing computer consulting instead?\n\nHe starts a company. He calls it Potomac Computer Systems. He goes around to families and businesses and helps them set up databases and the like. Thatâs going okay, but there is part of that or maybe unrelated. He eventually gets a 286 IBM computer. Weâve talked about this in a bunch of episodes. That 286 was the canonical Intel chip that would unlock the PC market and take it majorly mainstream.\n\nBen: This is the thing we talked about on the Intel episode that was their business when their business of memory got destroyed.\n\nDavid: Indeed. Tim realizes this that thereâs all of a sudden a pretty big install base out there. Even though he likes programming on the Apple II better, he sees all these other 286 IBM and IBM compatible PCs popping up and he says, there might actually be an even better business rather than selling my time for dollars that I could build around selling software for this nascent PC market.\n\nHe decides to do it. Heâs like, okay, what software am I going to write? To start writing software, I need to use a text editor on the IBM PC to write the software. This isâfor these listeners out there who are engineers or familiar with engineeringâpre-Vim and eMacs days. There are no good text editors. Heâs like, oh, great. Iâm going to write a text editor first for other software developers (sensing a theme here).\n\nHe sits down, he starts trying to do it, but he gets distracted and he keeps thinking about how he couldâinstead of writing this text editorâmake it into a game. He has this quote, he says, âI realized, hey, you know, I could make each character on the screen have a collision. I could have that cursor be a game character. I could turn this text editor into a little game. Similar to Atari Adventure, I based it on rooms. Each screen full of text became a room. I had different graphical characters represent different gameplay behaviors. Suddenly you could build a text document and hit the play button in this editor and now youâre up and running with your game.â He calls this game ZZT.\n\nBen: Oh, I didnât realize ZZT was the thing that was first a text editor. I knew that was his first game, but wow.\n\nDavid: It was his first game, but this is whatâs so cool and it just foreshadows everything to come with Epic. Because he started working on it as a text editor. He was just describing in that quote, you can design a room in the text editor and hit play, and then you can play the game. He ships ZZT as a game withâhe actually did it as shareware. The first room was free, and then you wrote to him and you paid to get the floppy disk with the other three rooms that were part of the game.\n\nBen: Which of course he would mail you.\n\nDavid: He would mail you, yup. Which is pretty awesome in and of itself. But because it was an editor itself, anybody who had the game could then make their own rooms and could also press play in their own rooms.\n\nBen: Yeah. Waving my hands around of things to pay attention to in the future here is get started playing this game for free and pay later, and then thing two being, hey, this game is editable.\n\nDavid: Yup. This is when he decides, hey, I probably need a different name for this business besides Potomac Computer Systems.\n\nBen: And something that makes it sound like a really big company like big, important.\n\nDavid: Yup. Weâre on the same level as id Software is just getting started around this time and they have a cool name. Why donât we call it Epic MegaGames? Of course, by we, I mean Tim because itâs just Tim. He releases ZZT and it does pretty well. He doesnât make a ton of money, but he sells a few thousand copies. Incredibly, they would keep selling the game until 2013.\n\nBen: What?\n\nDavid: Yeah, this is incredible. I found it in the research. Timâs dad, Paul, ended up taking over the distribution of the game. It was still just sold to this shareware model of writing to Tim.\n\nBen: Shareware was really big inâI remember it from the mid-90s where youâd go to software swaps, or youâd go to user groups. We were part of Mac users of Delaware, so weâd go to the mud meetings. People would demo and youâd swap software there or youâd sell software there. Because thereâs no internet to go find software, you need to discover it in some way from other nerds who are writing shareware.\n\nDavid: Yup. The reason shareware was attractiveâespecially to an indie software dev like Tim at the time wasâyour other alternatives were to try and go the retail packaged software model. To do that, you had to go get a big publisher like Electronic Artsâwas just getting started at this time. We did our episode with Drip at the beginnings of that industry. He was thinking about it like Hollywood. You need these big budgets, fund these studios, and then you had the relationships with the retailers to get the boxes into retail stores. The retailers would take 50%. When all was said and doneâ¦\n\nBen: Which is Appleâs current argument to congress.\n\nDavid: Exactly. When all was said and done, if Tim had gone the traditional publisher plus retail model, he wouldâve only been making (maybe if he was lucky) 10%, 15% of the revenue that he would be seeing out of the game. Whereas this shareware path, he kept 100%.\n\nBen: Pretty cool if you can get the discovery and distribution.\n\nDavid: Indeed.\n\nBen: Process the payments and do all the other very expensive things involved. I feel like Iâm Apple here over peddling away.\n\nDavid: It was lucky for Tim he had his dad to process the payments, i.e. opened the checks, packaged up the floppy disk in mailing envelopes, and sent them out. ZZT does pretty well. Like I said, they sell a couple of thousand copies of this. Tim starts looking around and one thing that he has always been really good at is observing whatâs going on in the market.\n\nI mentioned the id Software a minute ago and folks who know their gaming history know that it was John Carmack and John Romero would eventually end up making Doom, which weâll talk about in a minute.\n\nBen: And Quake, right?\n\nDavid: And Quake, yes. After Doom. But before Doom, id had released a game called Commander Keen. It was a 2D side-scrolling game. It was a pretty big graphical leap forward versus the literal text editor-based games like ZZT. Tim saw Commander Keen out there and he said, âOkay, thatâs interesting. I should do something like that. Whatâs a twist I could put on it? What if I do it with a female protagonist?â He basically cloned Commander Keen but called it Jill of the Jungle instead.\n\nBen: I love it.\n\nDavid: But because it was a 2D side-scrolling game, it wasnât just textbase. It needed actual artwork and assets in the game. Tim wasnât capable of doing that just on his own. He needs to recruit people, and he ends up recruiting some great folks that he meets on bulletin board systemsâagain, online in this proto-internet. Folks like Cliff Bleszinski, who is a 17-year-old high school student and applies to be a programmer at this big mega-companyâEpic MegaGames, ends up becoming one of the first employees. Cliff, known as CliffyB, would go on to become legendary and super important for Unreal and then the Gears of War Series. He recruits this great talent.\n\nAnd then he also realizes okay, I want to make this great game. I need the talent to make the games, but I also need some talent in the business and distribution side here because Iâm trying to build a big company. Who was the big company? Of course, at the time, it was id. He calls up id and starts talking with their president at the timeâMark Reinâwho was handling all of idâs distribution and publishing.\n\nBen: I didnât know he was the president of id. He recruited away the president?\n\nDavid: Yeah. He was the early president of id.\n\nBen: Wow.\n\nDavid: At first, theyâre talking about like, maybe id could publish Jill of the Jungle. But then, Mark ends up falling out with Carmack and Romero, leaving id. And Tim says, âHey, Iâve got a new and better idea. Why donât you come join us here at Epic and you can be our head of distribution and publishing?â He recruits Mark, who yeah, had been president of id to come join this company.\n\nBen: Thatâs a crazy career move for him. Heâs president of one of the biggest game companies in the world at that point. To go and take anything less than that title is wild.\n\nDavid: Totally wild. He became a vice president at Epic.\n\nBen: As employee three, two, or something.\n\nDavid: Indeed. He comes and joins Tim. Remember, Tim is like a junior in college at this point in time, and heâs got CliffyB working with him whoâs a senior in high school. But they put out this game and it does well. And then CliffyB starts working on a few other games that also do well.\n\nNext thing you know, theyâre selling quite a good bit of software through this Shareware model and doing quite well. Tim ends up dropping out of college in his final year, and they go full time on the business. Theyâre selling these games. Theyâre all still 2D side scrollers, but thereâs another pretty big revolution thatâs about to come in the nascent gaming industry here.\n\nBen: What year are we in?\n\nDavid: Weâre now in the early â90sââ91, â92. Pretty quickly after that, id and John Carmack start talking about this big project that theyâre working on, and itâs a game thatâs going to be called Doom. I have to assumeâalmost no matter what age you areâif youâre listening to this show, youâve heard of Doom, played some version of it over the years. But itâs easy to forgetâand I had forgotten until doing this researchâjust how revolutionary this game was at the time.\n\nBen: Was it the first 3D game?\n\nDavid: It was the first 3D game. Before Doom, everything looked like a Super Nintendo style game. Doom was the first game. This is crazy, it ran on just these commodity 286, 386 Intel PCs, and it ran on DOS, but Carmack was able to get a fully 3D world rendered and working.\n\nBen: Just amazing feats of computer science because this well predates graphic cards or anything thatâs optimized to do this. Itâs just an unbelievable amount of trigonometry and math.\n\nDavid: And John Carmack used all sorts of crazy programming tricks to make this work. It comes out, this becomes the Fortnite of its day because it was also distributed via shareware.\n\nBen: When you say the Fortnite of the day, letâs paint this clear. For this tiny constrained market that was video games, it owned that market. But were nothing like the hundred-plus billion-dollar video game market of today.\n\nDavid: No. For reference, Fortnite has 350 million registered players at this time. Doom ends up having a few million copies that it both sells and distributes via shareware in that first couple of years. Ultimately, it would get to 10 or 20 million copies. But no video game had ever approached anything like those numbers before.\n\nTim, Epic, and Mark are like, okay, cool. This is where the industry is going. We got to skate where the puck is going here. We need to work on a similar project. They do. They start getting to work on the project. Theyâre going to call their 3D shooter Unreal. But the problem wasâthat they quickly found out, just like we were sayingâthe things that John Carmack did to make Doom run were just huge feats of engineering. It was this massive proprietary advantage that id had.\n\nAnybody, like Tim and Epic, that was trying to get a competing product out there was just going to be nigh impossible. But this doesnât deter Tim. He starts thinking about an idea. Heâs like, okay, I know that id spends all this time and effort working to make Doom work. They work on other projectsâand Ben, you mentioned Quake. That would be the successor to Doom that they would come out with. Theyâre rewriting the wheel each time they come out with a new game.\n\nJohn did all this work to make Doom work. But they have to recreate a whole lot of that each time theyâre making another game. They have this lead, but itâs not like theyâre going to keep churning out game after game after game, and nobody else is going to catch up. I can take my time, build an engine similar to what Doom has. But if I make it a little more extensible, then I can use this engine and pump out a bunch of content internally and not have to go through all these hoops each time that id is having to go through. Heâs like, okay, cool. Weâre going to invest the time upfront to do this.\n\nBen: A parallel here in Jeff Bezos speak, Tim is working on a system that uses primitivesâbuilding blocks, rather than starting from zero each time. Because you build from primitives and assemble building blocks that are modular, and you can build on top of, each time you get compounding value out of each piece of work that you put in.\n\nDavid: Yup. He starts working on it, and heâs not shy about what heâs doing. Heâs trying to build hype for the game for Unreal. Heâs talking to game magazines and the like. A pretty incredible thing happens. Other developers and studios start coming to Tim and Mark saying, hey, I hear youâre working on this engine. We would also love to make 3D type games and compete with it in Doom. Would you be willing to license it to us? And Tim says, yes.\n\nBen: Whoa. And this is before they released Unreal? He was hyping this so much that they had a demand for the Unreal Engine before Unreal came out?\n\nDavid: Yes. In fact, I believe some of the first games that were made by third parties on the Unreal Engine came out within a few months or a year of Unreal itself.\n\nBen: Oh, wow. Crazy.\n\nDavid: Yeah. Totally crazy. It turns out this was a really big idea because these dynamics are not only not going to get easier in the industryâthe dynamics of the technical bar to build video games. That bar was just going to keep going up and up and up and up exponentially in tandem with Mooreâs Law. Without a tooling system like this, you would quickly become completely locked out no matter how good you were at being able to build a game.\n\nBen: One of the takeaways there is the timing to create a game engine is so perfect because, before that, you couldnât really create a game engine. And after that, you would be so woefully behind that you better be creating a game engine for a whole new paradigm because it would be foolish to start building a PC based game engine 5, 10 years after Tim did.\n\nDavid: Yup. And it turned outâalmost in a much bigger way than what Tim saw when he started working on Jill of the Jungleâsomebody whoâs a really, really great technical engineer, game developer, and programmer who could build an engine or parts of an engine like this isnât necessarily always going to be the right person that can have a great creative story idea, game design content. If something like this didnât start to exist, the creative people would just be totally locked out of the industry or would be relocated to working only within super big companies that had the engineering side of the house and a creative side of the house.\n\nBen: That makes sense. Listeners, I want to pause for a moment and say, we keep saying Tim. Today, Epic is a 2000-person company. Itâs almost appropriate to say Timâwhen the company makes decisions todayâit was especially true at this point because there were less than 15 people. Into the very small operation going on here, and Tim was absolutely making these strategic decisions about what the company would be and what it would do.\n\nDavid: Yeah. Not only was it a small operation. It was a remote operation. They didnât even all live in Maryland together. They were communicating via early internet technologies here. Finally, after just about five years of working on this, in 1998, Unreal came out and along with the official unveiling of the Unreal Engine for game developers.\n\nUnreal itself is a big hit, but also games that are built on it. Games like Deus Ex, which people might remember using it. And then a few short years after all of this comes out, thereâs a major change in the gaming industry, which after many years of talking about it, Microsoft finally enters the picture with the launch of the Xbox in 2001. This does a whole bunch of stuff. One, it inserts a huge amount of weight and marketing muscle behind gaming. Two, it massively expands the console market because of that marketing weight behind it.\n\nBen: Which is previously just the original PlayStation and N64. You had previous versions of Nintendo before that and the Atari 2600, but it was just the PS1, the N644, and the Dreamcast, were the only predecessors before Microsoft entered that console market.\n\nDavid: Indeed. Though, it was two separate parts of the market because Sony and Nintendo were the only viable players. Sony was where all the third-party developers went. Nintendo had terrible owners, royalty terms with third party developers because they sold their systems based on their first-party titlesâstuff that they were making in-house like Mario, Zelda, and [...].\n\nBen: Nintendoâs attitude has always been weâre both the best at technology and the best at creative gameplay. The systems are for our games. Sure, if you want to let us have most of the economics, then you too can develop for our system.\n\nDavid: But theyâre mostly a vertically integrated company. When Microsoft came out though, now all of a sudden, theyâre duking it out with Sony for developers. As a developer, on the one hand, thatâs good because now youâve got two companies competing for your favor and willing toâif youâre good and you have the promise of making good contentâwilling to give you good deals. But if you want to access the whole market, you want to have your title on both systems on the PlayStation and the Xbox.\n\nUnless youâre using an engine like Unreal, thatâs almost impossible to do. Youâre going to have to build from the ground up.\n\nBen: Full dual development teams.\n\nDavid: Full dual development teams. It turns out that this is a problem that Unreal can now really help with and solve because they can haveâunder the hood, itâs not quite as easy as just check a box to deploy to PlayStation.\n\nBen: It turns outâwrite once, run anywhere, have been promised many times, and have been successful zero of them.\n\nDavid: These days, itâs pretty close.\n\nBen: Tell that to a React Native developer.\n\nDavid: Itâs so much better (even then) than having to have two full separate development teams. Once this happens, they start getting some huge games in franchises and start moving over to building on Unreal. The Tom Clancy games, the Splinter Cell, Rainbow Six, BioShock, Mass Effect, and Borderlandsâthese are all in the early to mid-2000s. Theyâre coming overbuilding on Unreal and then being able to sell pretty quickly. They might do an exclusive with Sony or Nintendo for six months or whatever. That platform gets it first, but then theyâre able to access the rest of the market and go to the other half.\n\nBen: Right. By this point, Epic is a technology company. They make games and they make this game engine, which is a huge component of the gameâs value chain. But theyâre a technology company rather than aâfirst and foremostâgame company. When you ask Tim to describe the history, he describes, we have Epic 1.0, which was Potomac Computer Systems. We have Epic 2.0, where we realized that oh yeah, this technology company builds a game engine. Itâs the PC gaming revolution of the late â90s to about 2005.\n\nAnd then David, exactly what we were talking about now, this is what he calls Epic 3.0 where the massive proliferation of the console wars allowed usâa neutral third party that can dramatically bring your cost down, your efficiency up in developing a game full steam ahead on a console. We will be an essential part of building that business.\n\nDavid: Yup. And they do keep building some games in house as well, but theyâre thinking about it like Amazon and AWS. They are the first and best customer for the technology that theyâre building as part of the engine. They do Unreal Tournament, they do the Unreal championship, and they do other games.\n\nBen: I love how East Coast that just was. Did you say Unreal Tournament? That is how an East Coaster says tournament.\n\nDavid: I never even noticed that. Growing up I would say orange. Jenny has taught me to say orange.\n\nBen: Whatâs the Nintendo character?\n\nDavid: Mario?\n\nBen: All right, there you go. I got some New York friends that say Mario. Anyway, we digress.\n\nDavid: We digress. Appropriate digressions, though. By the mid-2000s, like weâre saying for a bunch of reasons, the big part of the gaming market is really in consoles. Specifically, itâs in Sony and Microsoft with the PlayStation and the Xbox. The PC gaming industry still exists, but itâs gotten tough because piracy has become rampant, not to mention Microsoft is now putting all of their weight in gaming behind the Xbox, not so much on PC gaming.\n\nTim, once again, sees that this is where things are going and decides, hey, what if we tie-up with Microsoft. Weâre going to be launching a new version of the Unreal Engine 3.0. Microsoft is coming out with its next-generation hardwareâthe Xbox 360 at the time. We might be able to get some really good marketing dollars here from them if weâre a launcher or near launch exclusive title with the 360.\n\nBen: And Microsoftâs effectivelyâin this relationshipâthe publisher and Epic is the developer.\n\nDavid: Yes. I believe that is correct. Epic develops this game called Gears of War, which most listeners will probably be familiar with.\n\nBen: Itâs the game where you could push that one button and put your back against the wall and look around the corner.\n\nDavid: Yup, totally.\n\nBen: Itâs so funny how so many had this signature move. That was amazing. That was in every commercial, that was in every demo. You first played the game, that is the thing that you wanted to try and do.\n\nDavid: And this thing sold so many Xbox 360s.\n\nBen: Yup.\n\nDavid: As a result of all of this, the thing is this becomes a red herring for the company. Epic ends up making $100 million of revenue on Gears of War. It cost them $12 million. I believe thatâs $12 million across development and marketing because Microsoft is handling so much of the marketing budget.\n\nBen: Wow. Iâd make that bet all day.\n\nDavid: Totally. They are making an 88% margin on $100 million in revenue. They have been successful in lots of dimensions up to this point, both on the technology and the game side, but this is a whole nother level.\n\nBen: Why ever be your own publisher? Itâs great if youâre the developer. Someone else is going to spend the money. You just have to develop the game. Itâs great. Why ever change?\n\nDavid: I remember I was just coming into graduating college and getting into media investment banking at the time, people were thinking like, oh man, games are going to be like Hollywood. This is a Hollywood movie-style money. The dynamics are really similar here. This is going to be great. It turns out though that Hollywood is not that good business in the industry, and why is that? Itâs super capital intensive.\n\nGears of War 1 was a red herring for a bunch of reasons. It was a launch title with the 360. Microsoft handled so much of the promotion and marketing. When Epic ends up doing Gears of War 2 and then Gears of War 3, the game sells roughly the same amount. Maybe not quite as much in terms of revenue, but their margins end up shrinking significantly down to 30%, 40%, and theyâre having to tie up all this huge amount of capital in the investments in developing these games and then marketing them. Tim and Epic realized this is not as interesting as we thought it was.\n\nBen: Time to get out. Also, it started to show the tension between the developer-publisher model. For folks who havenât listened to the EA episode. We talked about this on the Activation Blizzard episode. The developer is the creative. Think about it as the director on down on a movie set where youâre the one having the brilliant ideas and executing on them. The publisher is the investor. Theyâre fronting the money. Theyâre doing the marketing. They know how to businessify your creative efforts.\n\nThe issue is, when push comes to shove like it did after maybe Gears of War 3, Epic wanted to do a multiplayer-only version. They said, look, we think multiplayer gaming is the future. Hint hint, nudge nudge to where they are today. Online is right around the corner, starting to become a thing.\n\nDavid: And Microsoft was like, no, we donât care. We want to move more 360s.\n\nBen: Exactly. It was a stalemate at that point, and Microsoft was the publisher. Microsoft was the money behind it. They won.\n\nDavid: Weâre now right around the 2009, 2010 time frame. Tim has a quote. He says, âThere was an increasing realization that the old model wasnât working anymore and the new model was looking increasingly like the way to go.â What is the new model? Two things happen right around this time that totally laid the groundwork for what Epic is today.\n\nThe first is in October 2009. A little company in LA, a little startup in LA launches a game (if you could call it that). Itâs a mod on a mod of an existing game.\n\nBen: This is a mod of Half-Life 2?\n\nDavid: No, no, no, no. Iâm talking about League.\n\nBen: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The mod of Warcraft 3 is the mobile online battle arena game of Dota, or was it Defense of the Ancients?\n\nDavid: Yeah.\n\nBen: Of course, thereâs a lot of controversy over if this idea is theft or if this is above the bar. But you have this very similar-looking game that I think youâre referring to, David, being started by a plucky startup in LA in 2009.\n\nDavid: Yup. That company is Riot Games, and that game is League of Legends. Itâs a mobile massively online battle arena, but it represents a completely orthogonal path and a throwback away from this Hollywoodification of the games industry and back to small lean development teams taking a concept and iterating on it without having to invest tons and tons of development resourcesâand in particularâtons of marketing resources. Itâs distributed 100% online. Itâs a mod of an existing game engine thatâs out there.\n\nBen: Rip off.\n\nDavid: I didnât say that. But it means that it can get to market so much faster. And then another big innovation that they have is they donât charge for it. Itâs freeâfree to play. Free to play, that term had gotten a really bad name in the industry because mobile games had taken that up. Free to play really meant, yeah, you could play it for free, but if you wanted to make any progress in the game or a win, youâd have toâ¦\n\nBen: This was just starting. It got a really bad name in 2012, 2014 era. The iPhone was 2007. The App Store was 2008. It wasnât a quite dirty backwater. Social had given it a bad name before mobile gave it a bad name. The free to play stuff on Facebook wasâ¦\n\nDavid: It was the Zynga-type stuff. Zynga was probably (in many ways) not the worst offender in this regard. All of the games that you had to pay to make any progress. What League was and what Riotâs big innovation was that you could buy things, but they were just aesthetic. They were just virtual goods. They didnât help you succeed in the game in any way, shape, or form. They just gave you personality.\n\nBen: It was still free to win, but you could pay for other things.\n\nDavid: This ends up becoming known as a game as a service, which weâll get into in a second. The other big thing that happened that Epic was directly a part of was in September 2010, Epic demoed on stage at an Apple Keynote a demo of the Unreal Engine 3 running on iOS.\n\nBen: Oh, thatâs right. I forgot about that. That actually was the beginning of these really long distracting demos at Apple Keynotes of games. Where every time theyâre showing off some new graphics technology but youâre watching it over some stream. Youâre not sure what the new thing is, and youâre like, okay, theyâre showing off. This time itâs metal, and itâs an Apple in-house technology. Craigâs all excited about it. Okay, good. Glad someone else made another cool game that takes advantage of some harbor feature I donât understand. I always have beef with those being at Apple Keynotes, but I get that it was a leap forward.\n\nDavid: It was a leap forward because A) you could bring this incredible console-quality graphics and gaming technology to mobile. But it was even more important for the industry in terms of enabling cross-platform, deploying, development, and then ultimatelyâonline play of games. Epic now is right in the middle of all of this because if you have a game as a service, like League of Legends or any other free to win type game.\n\nBen: Importantly, thatâs fully distributed digitally. Thereâs no more box software. It is being distributed over the internet.\n\nDavid: Yup. You want to get that in the hands of as many players on as many platforms as possible. Game developers always wanted to do this. They wanted to be on Microsoft and Sony. But at the end of the day, theyâre selling box software, and thatâs fine. But when youâre no longer selling box software, youâre monetizing based on the engagement of players. Maximizing your total pool of players is really important. By far, at this point and then going forward, the vast number of computing devices capable of playing games out thereâtheyâre mobile devices.\n\nBen: Itâs the number of devices multiplied by 10 for the accessible market of games, or maybe more. But importantlyâI think the other thing that is relevant to this argument that youâre making about having a more direct relationship with those customers and wanting to reach as many customers as possibleâis theyâre now all on internet-connected devices. Rather than your only chance to monetize being every time you ship a new disk to a store and they buy it, you have an opportunityâat any given momentâto monetize, as long as there are payment systems in place.\n\nThe thing that digital distribution enabled was the idea that going back to the very beginning of what made Epic epicâthat they could give something away for free. But then since you had an always-on relationship with that customer, you could figure out your monetization down the line.\n\nDavid: What this does to the industry is it makes it like the SaaS industry. Youâd gone from expensive to develop capitalized software that required years of development time and was big and monolithic. Your Oracle, a lot of Microsoft software, and that type of thing. All of a sudden, developersâjust like software developersâare empowered to do small little things that solve a point niche problem, deploy it on best in class infrastructure like AWS out there, use something like Stripe to accept payments.\n\nBen: Donât we wish?\n\nDavid: Yeah, donât we wish. Get it out there, and be used and build real businesses with great economics. The same thing starts to happen in the gaming industry. Of course, who was the pioneer in doing all of these? In the middle of all of it, not just on their own, but then with Riotâitâs Tencent.\n\nBen: Yup. This is interesting because Riot is pioneering this in the United States. Tencent had already done it with the ability to do microtransactions on their early games in China. Something that they were definitely ahead on. As soon as Riot started to succeed in it very earlyâI think it was pre-2011, maybe 2010âTencent invested in Riot.\n\nDavid: Once Tencent saw Riot succeeding with this model in the West, they first invested in Riot in 2010, and then they bought the company in 2011. Tim sees all of these going on. He wants to move Epic in the direction of becoming essentially the AWS plus Stripe enabling this future renaissance in independent creators and game developers.\n\nBen: The current state of their business, they had sold Gears of Warâthe full franchise, all the IP, and everythingâto Microsoft.\n\nDavid: Not quite yet.\n\nBen: Okay.\n\nDavid: First he starts talking to Tencent and agrees in 2012âfor the first time everâto sell any equity in Epic games. He sells a 40% stake in Epic to Tencent for $330 million. Valuing Epic at just under $1 billion, which was crazy at the time. People were like this is nuts. This is a video game technology developer that is having bad economics with their big franchise, Gears of War. Whatâs going on here?\n\nBen: The thing that people didnât realize at the time wasâeven ignoring the game as a service betâhow stable the platform business was. One of the things I want to mention in the playbook but we need to talk about now is gaming is classically a hits-driven business. What you have with the Unreal Engine is a smoother on that. That business has just grown steadily since its inception. You now have this massive steady business underneath your more spikey hits-driven games business.\n\nDavid: Yup. With this investment from Tencent, Tim maintains majority control of the company. He says all right, weâre going to refocus the entire company around this vision of the future. Weâre going to do three things. One, the Unreal Engine is now our most important product and piece of technology, and we need to add much more to it. Itâs not going to be just about the engine for creating the game. It needs to be all the infrastructure to run these games, run live ops, do payments, and do all of these things.\n\nFunny aside at the time, when I was at Madrona, we were venture investors in a company called PlayFab in Seattle. Which was an independent startup that had the same vision of weâre going to build the infrastructure layer for operating these games as a service and be like Unreal or be like Unityâtheir competitorâwhich we havenât mentioned yet. PlayFab ended up getting acquired by Microsoft. It turned out that Epic and Unity were going to do these things themselves as well, and it was all going to be a part of the platform.\n\nBen: Yeah. There was definitely industry speculation at that point that those things would not be part of game engines. That they were a separate factorable thing. Weâll talk about this but Epic has Epic online services today. Thereâs a lot that lives in that middle ground of is it part of the engine, or is it more a part of an online service? But Epic obviously had, not only the relationships with developers, but the ability to bundle things that might not have used to be considered part of an engine, but add more and more and more to that ball of yarn where it was no longer just physics, but it was physics, characters, AI, the way that they interact, and all sorts of things to help with the live ops of your game.\n\nDavid: That was one. Two, as Tim says, weâre going to rationalize the console business. I donât want to be in that anymore. Weâre going to sell the Gears of War franchise to Microsoft. They did that in early 2014. The Tencent investment was in late 2012.\n\nThree, to make all this work, we need to have a thousand flowers blooming out there of people developing on the creators, developers, and game makers developing on the Unreal platform. We canât anymore be charging people a SaaS fee to use our platform because thatâs going to lock out the kids in high school who are building stuff at game jams.\n\nBen: Right. Incentives are powerful. If you charge money for something, less people will do it.\n\nDavid: Yup. In March 2015âthis was super ahead of the curveâEpic stopped charging a licensing fee for the Unreal Engine, making it completely free to use and develop on. Remember, Unity is out there as well, which is a competing third-party game engine.\n\nBen: Mostly focused on mobile.\n\nDavid: Mostly focused on mobile, but you could use it for lots of things.\n\nBen: For sure, but simpler, newer, amazing for 2D stuff, lighter, and more accessible, but youâre not going to go build the most amazing 3D first-person shooter PC game with it.\n\nDavid: On Unity, no. Theyâre still charging a SaaS fee. Unreal now is completely free. Youâre getting literally the stuff that Gears of Wars is developed on for free. Instead, the business model is switched to a 5% royalty on revenue that you would earn on your games after publishing. Thatâs a pretty good deal. If you think about the amount of fixed cost youâd have to capitalize on to do this, it would just be huge. Even your ongoing operating cost to run technology, it would be more than 5% of your revenue.\n\nBen: Totally. Youâd have to be massive for it to make more sense for you to build your own engine now than use Unreal, which is exactly the strategy. When you look at who develops their own proprietary game engines, itâs only the Activision Blizzard of the world, the Riot Games. But very large publishers that you know of, so think Bluehole for PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, which of course we will talk about later. Lots of big cross-platform 3D games from big studios that just arenât quite as big as Activision Blizzard or Riot use Unreal instead of developing their own proprietary thing.\n\nDavid: Yup. Those are the three big moves that Epic makes after the Tencent investment, and they are all just so spot on and really enabled them to become the AWS plus Stripe plus plus plus in the industry.\n\nBen: Stripe doesnât feel right yet. Stripe to me would be like the Epic Games Store.\n\nDavid: Yes, theyâre building the groundwork for all that.\n\nBen: Yeah. To put it in Timâs parlance. Epic 3.0 was consoles. Epic 4.0 is free to play games as a service digital distribution. But exactly what youâre talking about, David, is this incredibly robust primitives that serve as the horizontal layer to make games. Theyâve stepped back from weâre a game-maker, accept.\n\nDavid: Accept. Just like Amazon though, they still have this view of well, we can be the internal kind of first and best customer to show whatâs possible with these tools. We have this rich history of making great games that people love. They decide that theyâre going to spin up three teams internally to start working on Epicâs new tools to build new games from Epic that are going to run on these games as a service free to win model.\n\nThe first that they start working on is a reboot of the Unreal Tournament. The second is a MOBA thatâs going to include Gears of Wars-style action elements. It was called Paragon. And the third was going to be a whole brand new IP that was going to combine elements of Minecraft and crafting with a tower defense type dynamic. Those games were popular at that moment in time. They had a really cool name for it. They were going to call it Fortnite.\n\nBen: Well, we just got $330 million and boy are we going to spend it is the way that I hear that.\n\nDavid: Yup. Spoiler alert. Just like a lot of times when a company gets $330 million and has the core economic engine of the company but then they have other projects that they want to work on, those other projects donât go so well. None of those three games work at all.\n\nBen: Itâs interesting you say none of the three. Iâm excited to talk about that. The other thing to think about here is this is a company with a bootstrapped culture. They have always been starved for resources. They had always been a few people. They had always been figuring out whatâs the right partner or the right way that we can only make a game when weâre sure that itâs going to be worth it for us.\n\nNow, theyâve got so many resources. This is exactly what we talked about on the Eventbrite episode with Julia and Kevin. Raise a bunch of money and thereâs a lot of things that seem like good ways to deploy that capital because you can conceptualize why it all makes sense. But then you become this large organization. I donât want to call it in-fighting but conflicting views about what the future should be. There are people who are vying for political power thatâs saying, my game is the most important game. It results in churn. This happens all through Epicâs history but they bought companiesâsome worked, some didnât. They bring in these studios. Sometimes theyâd end up writing them off. It just increases all that fervor and churns around trying to do a bunch of stuff.\n\nDavid: And remember, what was Epic and Tim really, really good at? He was good at looking at what was succeeding in the market at that given moment in time, remixing it a little bit to make it fresh, and then putting it back out there quickly. Thatâs what he did with ZZT. Thatâs what he did with Jill and the Jungle. Thatâs what Unreal was after Doom. And thatâs not what theyâre doing with these three projects here. Itâs unclear that the market really wants them. They operate for years in development for each of these games.\n\nBen: Started in 2011, 2012.\n\nDavid: Yup, and going all the way through 2017. And then basically a miracle happens. So you mention PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. Tell us a little bit about PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.\n\nBen: Rewind to 1999. There was a book release in Japan called Battle Royale, or at least thatâs the English translation of it. In 2000, this was made into a popular Japanese movie. It basically inspired the Hunger Games. Think about a battle on an island. A bunch of childrenâI think itâs a fight to the death. Itâs a little dark.\n\nDavid: Seriously dark.\n\nBen: But you want to be the last person standing. Thereâs a variety of games and different anime series through the early 2000s that are based on this Battle Royale concept. There are early games. Thereâs Daybreak. End of the 2010s or mid of the 2010s, thereâs this gameâH1Z1âthatâs starting to incorporate this Battle Royale concept into a game. Is it 2017 that Battlegrounds comes out?\n\nDavid: Yup, March 2017.\n\nBen: And we will henceforth refer to it as PUBG. PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds comes out and it is a smash hit. It is like this notion of thereâs a fixed amount of time. Thereâs this circle that is contracting, itâs going to bring everybody closer and closer and closer together, and you have to be the last person standing. The action is fast-paced. Itâs a pretty short amount of time that each game lasts. Itâs not this 50-minute MOBA style game. It is get in, enjoy the action, and get out. Even if you win, itâs not that long of a game. It is really fun, and boy does it skyrocket off the charts, especially becauseâDavid, exactly as youâre sayingâdigital distribution. It is free to win. It is leveraging these in-app purchase adornments that you can buy for your character skins. But itâs pretty realistic. The violence is actual violence. It is a war game.\n\nDavid: Itâs dark. Itâs realistic. Also though, when it first comes out, itâs in beta. Itâs built on Unreal. Itâs not a big team. Itâs not Activision making this. Itâs an indie dev out there.\n\nBen: Raise your hand if you heard of Bluehole before this podcast. Unless youâre in the industry, you havenât heard of PlayerUnknown's parent company.\n\nDavid: No. And alsoâin these early daysâitâs only on PC, I think.\n\nBen: I think youâre right.\n\nDavid: And it was not yet cross-platform. Again, especially with a game like this. You want as many people as possible to play. You want your friends to play. And not all your friends are going to have gaming PCs. In a literally Epic move, the company and Tim see this happening, realize that these internal game projects are not getting any traction.\n\nBen: The Unreal Tournament team, I think they knew at this point that wasnât going to ship. By the way, the title Fortnite inside of Epic started in 2011, so itâs been six years of development and you have this other Unreal Tournament team that I think had already given up at this point. It was clear that it was not going to ship. Paragon is taking a crap ton of resources to make that a reality. Thatâs the internal status of the company when PUBG hits.\n\nDavid: PUBG hits, within two months, the Unreal Tournament team hops over into the Fortnite assets. I remember theyâre all developing on the Unreal Engine. They all know how to work with the assets and the code here. They build and launch a new mode of Fortnite called Fortnite Battle Royale that is a Fortnite graphic cartoony take on this Battle Royale concept that PUBG has just taken massive. They ship it in September 2017. Within 2 weeks, they get 10 million active players. This is bonkers.\n\nTen million players are probably what Doom got in the whole life of the game. Within six months, they have 125 million active players. Incredibly, there are some dynamics here. Like you mentioned Ben, thereâs less violence. It appeals to kids more, especially it appeals to parents more who are willing to let their kids play this.\n\nBen: Yeah. When you die, the drone comes and scans your body and warps you away. I donât think thatâs the right terminology, but youâre not bleeding out in the street the way you are in PUBG.\n\nDavid: Yup. But unlike PUBG, which is only on PC at this pointâbecause of all of Epicâs resourcesâthey immediately deploy it cross-platformâPCs, consoles, mobile devicesâall within the first few months of launching. Sony actually would be a big hold out. Sony would let Epic release it on the PlayStation, but wouldnât allow PlayStation players to cross-platform play with the other platforms because they wanted to keep everything in-house in the PlayStation Network. Epic eventually convinces Sony that, hey, you canât keep this cat in the bag here.\n\nBen: They may have even gone to 125 million users before launching mobile. Maybe thatâs wrong, but I remember it was a smash hit phenomenon and it wasnât on mobile yet. That was the craziest thing. The games industry absolutely turned on its head at this point because everyone is just told Esports is going to be this massive moneymaker, which it ended up not being.\n\nDavid: You were building an Esports company at the time, right?\n\nBen: Yeah. I was very deep in this at this time with Taunt. Esports was a really good idea for the publishers and really not that interesting for everyone else. Streaming was interesting for lots of players in the value chain. The interesting thing about being in that industry at that moment was PUBG went from nowhere to being dominant. We all thought, wow, here is this new arrival of this thing is going to be a fixture along with Activision Blizzardâs games and Riotâs games. A few months later, boom. Fortnite blows it out of the water and just steals share like crazy and then goes to even bigger and newer heights.\n\nIt was the craziest thing because youâre like, God, the fervor in this industry right now of what is going to be the staying power franchise is crazy. I want to reflect back on the launch a little bit because Fortnite did launch its original game built by the original teamâFortnite: Save the World. That basically didnât work. It came out, PUBG came out, and PUBG won. This thing was not about a Battle Royale game.\n\nDavid: [...] won. It wasnât a fight because Fortnite wasnât playing the same.\n\nBen: Right. No one was talking about it. The craziest thing was, internally at Epic, when you said they started working on the Fortnite assets, what that looked like was copying the code base that a whole other teamâit was basically lying fallow.\n\nThe Unreal Tournament team takes that fourth code base, rebuilds the whole thing using the gameplay mechanics of PUBG, and launches it. You then have this fascinating internal struggle of trying to figure out, how do you combine these two teams? One of which poured six years of their lives into getting 95% of the way there but got the core gameplay mechanic wrong. And the other which spent the last few months working on a new project, having fresh eyes, and not being clouded by all the baggage of previous decisions and haggling made over the last six years that has this smash hit. And all anybody out in the world cares about is, Fortnite. Anything lower level than that or internal politics, donât care about.\n\nYou have to figure out as a companyâwhen you know you just have this thing thatâs magically captivated the worldâhow do you throw all of your resources at it and bring everyone together and kumbaya to say we as a company are doubling down on this thing as our thing along with our other thing the technology platform of the Unreal Engine?\n\nDavid: Thatâs what I was going to say. Itâs not even the business model of the company. The business model of the company and Tim, heâs really gotten religion at this point in time. The mission is to build the tools, be the AWS and Stripe, and live ops for a day before all developers make games. This is just such an important backdrop to whatâs going on now. Because now weâll run through whatâs happening. But Tim again, heâs just viewing this. This is a windfall. This is awesome. This means I get more firepower and more ability to play offense in getting my ultimate vision to come true here.\n\nLike we said, Fortnite, Battle Royaleâa major cultural phenomenon. Estimates are that they made $2.5 billion in revenue in 2018 alone. It launched in September 2017. 2018, $2.5 billion in revenue. In October 2018, Epic raised its first non-strategic capital raise. They raise $1.25 billion from KKR, Disney, and several other investors at a $15 billion valuation.\n\nBen: Quite the step up.\n\nDavid: Quite the step up. In December 2018, they launched Fortnite Creator mode, which is almost bringing Roblox type elements into Fortnite by letting people create and ultimately monetize their own designs, levels, and experiences. In doing so, at the same time, they launch the Epic Games Store. This is now bringing forward all of this future that Tim wants to come to bear. What ultimately set the stage for this confrontation with Apple and Google, the Epic Games Store, theyâre going to sell their own games onlineâFortnite currency, V-Bucks, and third party games in the Epic Games Store. Of course, you can do this on PCs and the web.\n\nBen: The opportunity is to compete with Steam. Steam has been doing this forever. Frankly, the knock-on valve is those guys havenât had a hit in forever. Theyâre just taking a vague or a rake on all these other games that they have a monopoly on PC game distribution.\n\nDavid: Yup, and theyâre taking a 30% cut.\n\nBen: And Epic had such a hit with Fortnite where they were like, we have the advantage of never needing to be in your store and always going direct. Now we have this direct channel, but all these customers are like, we should leverage that.\n\nDavid: Yup. What did they launch the store with? They launched the store with a 12% cut of the revenue. They undercut Valve by 18%. And then, the kicker is, if you build your game on the Unreal Engine, the 5% revenue fee gets baked into the 12%.\n\nBen: Unreal.\n\nDavid: Literally Unreal. Epic is saying, you get the engine, the live ops, and the distribution in the store and the payment processing that comes with that for a maximum fee of 12% of your revenue.\n\nBen: Itâs wild. Letâs even ignore the lack of double-dipping on that 5% from the Unreal Engine. That 12%, the way that Tim talks about it is basically its cost plus pricing model. Where he says, look, I think itâs going to take 5%, 7% to run the store. We donât need to make more than 5%. We think Apple and Steam are getting away with highway robbery. Weâre just basically going to make sure that at the maximum we make 5%. If youâre really trusting in us and building in our full-stack, weâre not going to charge twice.\n\nIt is the exact opposite of what every other CEO in the technology industry these days is doing.\n\nDavid: Itâs not like Google says, hey, if you use GCE for your infrastructure, whatever you spend on that, weâre going to give you credits in AdWords.\n\nBen: No. Weâll give you a reduced price if you buy more from us, but weâre certainly not going to say, yeah, yeah, weâll give you core assets for free.\n\nDavid: Totally. 2019 is the clash between Valve, Steam, and the Epic Games Store. Valve respondsâthey cut their take rate to 25%. Theyâre going back and forth. But really, this is setting the stage for what would happen now this year.\n\nBen: One other conflict that happened previously too is with Google where Epic basically said, look, we're not going to go through Google Play anymore. Because Android, you have this nice open platform. You brag about it being an open platform. We are going to have people download the APK where theyâre just going to sideload and install the app directly.\n\nWhat Epic and all of the people who want to play Fortnite on Androids realizes, thereâs a litany of oh my God, youâre about to get your phone hacked dialogues that come up between downloading that app and getting to play it, and every time thereâs an update. This is something that Epic walked back from and eventually did list on the Google Play Store because Google, as Tim calls it, has a fake open ecosystem. Despite getting to proselytize about how the Google Play Store is not the only way to launch on their platform, in reality, it is.\n\nDavid: Then this year, Epic decides to take this fight directly to, as you said, not just Google, but Apple.\n\nBen: The other Tim.\n\nDavid: The other Tim. Tim [...]. I wonder how much the timing of this? Clearly, Tim had been thinking about this and plotting this move for a while. But this was the first year we started to see some cracks, not just in the game developer sentiment about these App Store take rates, but among other software developers. Thereâs the whole Hey, Controversy with Basecamp around Apple and the 30% cut that theyâre taking on Hey email software.\n\nBen: Apple has this very silly role where they say, either youâre using our payments infrastructure, or if you choose to use your own, there can be no link or reference to it in the app. Hey basically linked to their website or something like that, thus violated App Store policy.\n\nDavid: But itâs all the same spirit here of how muchâ\n\nBen: Right. Pay us 30% or have this gross and horrible user experience where people have no idea how to sign up for your thing.\n\nDavid: While all of this is going on, cracks are starting to form in the developersâ sentiment with Apple and a little bit Google. Now, Epic is here sitting on, not just the biggest game in the world, but the biggest cultural phenomenon, and on par with TikTok, social networking experience as well. Itâs a pretty big point of leverage with these ecosystems.\n\nFinally, on August 13, 2020, Epic pushes a new version of Fortnite to the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store that offers a permanent discount on V-Bucksâthe in-game currency in Fortniteâif you buy directly from Epic. Which I believe you could do now in this new version of the app.\n\nBen: You still can if you have the app on your phone.\n\nDavid: Oh, if you still have that version of the app. Apple and Google immediately delist Fortnite from their app stores.\n\nBen: And then they said you need to upload a new version that doesnât include this.\n\nDavid: And Tim said, nope, not going to do that.\n\nBen: Yup. Then the pitchforks come out. This comes right on the heels on the antitrust controversy. Epic deeply prepared for this and thought this through, and they released this unbelievable videoâthis free Fortnite video where youâve got Tim Cook is the evil IBM-like character from the original 1984 commercial. Epic, theyâre coming in to swing the hammer and throw it at the evil IBM Tim Cook character.\n\nDavid: Itâs all Fortnite characters. Itâs so good.\n\nBen: It is the deepest dagger you can stab at the Apple executive team and really make them feel like the villains in this story. The pitchforks continue to come out. Everyoneâs escalating. Apple says we are going to ban your developer account.\n\nDavid: This is a major escalation here.\n\nBen: Yeah. That says, if you donât submit an updated version of Fortnite to the App Store that doesnât violate our terms and services, we are going to ban your developer account. What that meansâif you dig into it isâwe are going to make it so that you can no longer distribute new versions of the Unreal Engine to your developers that they can compile in their code and then submit to the iOS or Mac App Stores. Theyâre basically saying, look, all iOS and Mac App Store, weâre just going to break the ability to use Unreal Engine if you're a developer on those app stores.\n\nNow they have got a two-front war. Thereâs a Fortnite war and Apple has dragged the Unreal Engine into this. Of course, this goes to the courts. Thereâs an injunction filed. The most recent couple of pieces of information that we know are that a judgeâfor at least the next monthâhas said, Apple this thing that youâve done bringing the Unreal Engine into this. You canât put a little ticking time bomb on Epic and say that youâre going to break their developer account that deeply to the point where Unreal Engine wonât work for all of these game developers anymore. Thatâs one step too far.\n\nThe thing that you can keep haggling about is whether Fortnite needs to submit a new version that doesnât violate your policies and has only a transaction with Apple that pays the 30% cut. Thatâs still in fairgrounds to fight about. Apple, you can keep Fortnite out of the App Store for anyone whoâd want to download it now. They didn't mandate. I donât believe that you have to keep letting the existing version of Fortnite work on peopleâs phones, but it is. I expect that Apple has a very powerful kill switch at its disposal.\n\nWe will see if Apple decides to stop allowing the existing version of Fortnite with the payment loophole thatâs on 100 million-plus phones or tens of millions of phones to break. But that is the state of where things are today.\n\nDavid: Yeah. Just right before we went to record, Epic hit back and announced that existing Fortnite instances running on Apple devices are going to lose access to the next Fortnite season and cross-play ability. They'll no longer be able to play with friends that are on other platforms, whether thatâs Android, a console, or PC.\n\nBen: When tech giants clash, customers lose.\n\nDavid: Indeed.\n\nBen: We will get to that more in grading. David, do you have any else in history and facts here?\n\nDavid: No. I think that is quite the Epic story for history and facts.\n\nBen: All right. Before we go into our analysis, weâd like to thank Bamboo, the official sponsor of the analysis of all of Season 7. Bamboo is one of the top growth marketing firms in tech. They have supported world-class growth programs for startups like AllTrails, Peloton, friends of the show at rover.com, and many more.\n\nWhether itâs paid search, paid social, creative production, attribution, or product analytics, Bamboo services always have the same objectives in mind.

You can click the link in the show notes, or go to growwithbamboo.com to learn more.\n\nOkay, so our next sectionâin many episodesâis called the acquisition category. There wasn't an acquisition here. David and I have thought a little bit about what we're trying to accomplish with this category. We think that it's best described by a book that we're obsessed with, have had an LP call with the author, and just really think it's brilliantâthe 7 Powers.\n\nWhat are the 7 powers? They're basically the ways thatâHamilton, if you're listening, I'm going to butcher the definition hereâa leader in a category can earn outsized profits versus all of their competitors. It's basically what's the thing that makes your business powerful versus your competitors. I think this gets at the core, David, of what and why we want to dissect what the core essence of a business is.\n\nDavid: There's so much going on here with the technology platforms, the evolution of the games industry in real-time, and then this Fortnite phenomenon. What is the power that Epic has? There are seven categories of power in the 7 Powers that Hamilton identifiesâcounter positioning, scale economies, switching costs, network economies, process power, branding, and cornered resources.\n\nMost companies that have power have one, maybe two of these. I think Epic has three powers that are concurrently going on here. I would say they have scale economies because the scale at which you need to operate your infrastructure to power a game like Fortnite, PUBG, or any of the other large games that run on Unreal, you need a huge amount of infrastructure. And then to amortize that infrastructure costs such that you're able to sell it essentially at 5% to 12% of your annual customersâ revenue. Nobody else can match that.\n\nBen: No, it's the same way that Netflix draws its power. By having the largest subscriber base, it has the lowest per subscriber costs to produce content.\n\nDavid: Yup, or AWSâsame deal. I think there are switching costs. That might be the most directly powerful here. If you're PUBG or you're any game that's built on Unreal, you have no choice except to continue running on Unreal. You're not going to spin up something on your own. You could maybe try and switch over to Unity, but that's going to be very, very difficult, and not going to have the same types of features that you need.\n\nBen: We've leaned on this a few times, and obviously, itâs a private company so the financials aren't public, but it's fair to assume that the Unreal Engine on its own does about $1.5 billion a year in revenue. This thing that lots of developers are pretty locked into because they committed, and it was a good decision too. We're not saying that they should have picked anything else because basically, if you're building a mobile game that's really pretty simple, you should be using Unity. And if you're building a broader cross-platform 3D complex gameâespecially one that requires meaningful physicsâyou should be using Unreal. They're generating this $1 billion, $2 billion, (call it) $1.5 billion alone from that engine business.\n\nDavid: That's 5% of the revenue that they're making. Multiply that by 20 to get the amount of revenue that their customers are generating. Those are the two powers that apply to the core technology Unreal Engineâonline services and all the infrastructure are part of the business. But then with Fortnite, they also have this network economy. This is where cross-platform becomes so important. Fortnite on iOS without cross-platform is so kneecapped. Imagine youâre a kid or anybody who hangs out with their friends on Fortnite, whether that's playing Battle Royale, in creator mode, or attending the concerts that are on [...]. Travis Scott hosted a concert.\n\nBen: Marshmello.\n\nDavid: Marshmello had 14 million people attending. Now, interestingly, that's not like there was one room with 14 million people. It was limited (I think) to 50 actually for the Travis Scott concert. You want to be in the instance with your 49 friends. You don't want to be with 49 strangers. Now, if all of a sudden, if most of your friends are not going to be playing on an iOS device, they're going to be on a console. They're going to be on a Switch. They're going to be on an Android device. Now, you can't play with them. That hugely removes the value.\n\nBen: David, I think this is a good time to bring in the other pillars of Epic's business. Of course, weâve talked about Fortnite. That on its own is somewhere between $1 billion and $2 billion a year in revenue right now. You got the game engine. That's another $1 billion to $2 billion a year in revenue. You have the apps store, or what do they call it?\n\nDavid: The Epic Games Store.\n\nBen: The Epic Games Store. I think it's losing money right now because of the amount of marketing dollars that they're pouring into it and deals that they're doing to get games in there exclusively. There's a lot of dollars that they're pouring in to make that a successful thing on its own.\n\nThey started with a huge head start because they converted all of the Fortnite launchers into Epic Games Stores. I can't remember how many million it was, but overnight, millions and millions of people suddenly had the Epic Games Store and now had other games in there. If you want to deep dive into the Epic Games Store, you should go and read the Matthew Ball piece that we have linked in the show notes. It's awesome.\n\nBut then, there's this fourth pillar of the Epic online services, which is not a huge business for Epic yet but is exactly the sort of thing that Tim Sweeney loves. You can sort of plug into any one of these AWS-like services in the Epic online services, whether or not you're using the engine. There should just be a tremendous amount of interop across the whole industry where you can use the matchmaking service, you could use the friendsâ list.\n\nThere are all sorts of ways that you can allow people to play cross-platform or for friends to be aware of each other. If one person's playing one game on an Xbox and the other person's playing a different game on their phoneâusing these Epic online services, they could all sort of be a part of the same metaverse.\n\nDavid: There it is. It took us long enough to get there.\n\nBen: Here we are an hour-and-a-half in.\n\nDavid: Thatâs the power. Right now, in the current instantiation of Epicâwith the Epic online services having just been nascent in adoption, and Fortnite being the first and best customer of itâthat network economyâs power only lives in the Fortnite part of Epic's business. What you're talking about is they want to bring all of that network economy and network effect of all these friend connections, and all the cross-platform into everything that is built on the Epic technology. That's pretty powerful. I think that's probably also what's scary to Apple, to Google, and probably to Facebook too.\n\nBen: Yeah. This hits at the core of how Tim Sweeney philosophically thinks about what Epic's mission in the world is and how it is diametrically opposed to Apple, Facebook, and Google. It's not only open versus closed. It's more like Tim thinks there's another internet to be built by basically bringing down rent everywhere. Take rates should dramatically go down, and interoperability should dramatically go up. Think about when the World Wide Web first launchedâhow wide open it wasâbut Tim's vision is a little bit more privacy protected. That you can't just drop arbitrary Javascript in and collect information on people.\n\nThink about the Ready Player One world, but rather than it all being one company, he has this vision ofâand he'll name his competitors. It's remarkable to listen to him talk. That the Roblox economy could interact with the Fortnite economy. You could buy goods and bring them between worlds. You can easily shift between those worlds with your friends. I think that the way that he thinks about the world and this metaverse that he wants everyone to live in is commerce is going to be online in this digital space. Social connections are going to live there. It's not just games, and it shouldn't all belong to one company.\n\nYou look at the way that Apple is approaching this particular fight and this whole 30% battle, it is, we are entitled to 30% of everything that happens on our platform. And Tim is pounding his fist and saying, nothing is yours and nothing is ours.\n\nDavid: Yup. Tim Sweeney, not Tim Cook whoâs pounding his fist.\n\nBen: Exactly. Too many Tims.\n\nDavid: Yeah.\n\nBern: As usual, there are too many white men in power in our stories.\n\nDavid: Absolutely. But I think this is what's really cool. The whole concept of the metaverse, Ready Player One, and all that is so cool. People have wanted it to come about for so long, and VR was kind of a head fake around this. VCs got very excited, myself included. It is actually starting to happen now, just not in the way that anybody expected. Everything we've talked about so far with all of EpicâEpicâs technology, the experiences that they makeâis in the context of thinking about them as games. But weâve already crossed the Rubicon. They're not just games anymore.\n\nBen: Fortnite has observer mode. There's a wayâif you don't feel like playingâyou can still go get on chat with your friends and watch them play without you having to be involved in the game. It's a hangout place.\n\nDavid: Creator mode, where you can create all sorts of experiences and play them with your friends. That's what people also do in Roblox. That's what people do in Rec Room. We've had Nick Fajt on the show, the CEO of Rec Room. I think this is what Tim is talking about here.\n\nAnd then you think about the tools that Epic makes. They're so powerful and can enable experiences that just honestly would have been impossible to imagine two years ago. We haven't talked about yet on the episode, but things like The Mandalorianâthe awesome Disney Plus TV series. That series was basically made in the Unreal Engine. They filmed the whole thing on a soundstage with digital walls, and all of the sets were built virtually in Unreal.\n\nBen: It's so freaking insane. Iâm going to hold my tongue. For now, it is the coolest, most insaneâhow are there zero practical effects on that whole thing?\n\nDavid: Am I stealing your thunder from later?\n\nBen: But the point you're making is you can enable high IP franchises to be filmed and created out of a fraction of the cost, in a fraction of the time frame. And it's not just theoretically it could happen. The Unreal Engine branching out of gaming, Fortnite branching out of gaming is happening inâ¦\n\nDavid: It's already happened.\n\nBen: â¦sort of real iconic use cases.\n\nDavid: Yeah. Okay. Any other powers you had on your list?\n\nBen: No, those were mine too. Into the section of what would have happened otherwise, if we were looking at transactions here of acquisition, this would be what would have happened if the big company hadn't bought the little company. Here, the way I want to analyze this of what would have happened otherwise if Tencent had not invested.\n\nAnd before we talk about if they hadnât invested, I want to talk about their investment for a moment because I ran some numbers and holy everything, you guys. This is a crazy investment. Weâve covered some crazy investments on the show. I think Naspersâ Tencent is one of the all-time best, but this one isâlet's just run through some numbers.\n\nIn 2012, Tencent bought 40% of the company for $330 million. That 40% stakeâplayed forward six years, in October of 2018âwhen they raised the round on the valuation of $15 billion, that's now worth $5.4 billion, if I did my delusion math right there. It took them six years to turn $330 million into $5.4 billion, which I think is a 60% annualized return on that money. One way to contextualize that is if you're a VC and you're listening to this, let's say you're a smaller series A firm, and you've got a $330 million fund. That's like investing the whole fund and generating a 16X only six years into the life of the fund.\n\nDavid: Yeah. The crazy, crazy, crazy thing though about Tencentâand why they're just on a whole another level than anyone else out thereâis this is far from even their best investment. We covered what's probably their best right now. I haven't run the math on Meituan, but in Pinduoduo, two episodes ago, that stake (I think) is worth $20 billion some odd now. And they've invested less than $1 billion.\n\nBen: Yeah, it's wild.\n\nDavid: And similar order of magnitude for Meituan.\n\nBen: Unbelievable investors. And they bet huge, with conviction, and are often right. Anyway, a quiet giant. The other thing that I want to say about that deal, not the 2012 deal, but the 2018 deal, is when they were valued at $15 billionâI hadn't done my research on the company at that point, and I was like, oh my God. People are caught up in the Fortnite hype. This is not going to end well. But in 2018, they did $5.6 billion in revenue, $3 billion of which was profit. That valuation is 5X EBITDA. Thatâs not crazy at all.\n\nDavid: Not crazy at all.\n\nBen: I'd be a buyer. It's very rational relative to a lot of this other mid-teens, $20 billion, $30 billion, and $40 billion valuations that we saw from lots of other companies over the last several years. This business grew incredibly quickly, was spitting off cash, and continues to.\n\nDavid: It reminds me a lot in that way of Zoom. Here's a company that's been growing incredibly quickly, incredibly capital efficiently Zoom (I believe) generated over $1 billion in free cash flow last quarter. You contrast that with all these other companies out there that are burning capital. It reminds me also of just how we started at the top of the show with who Tim Sweeney is, what his goals are, and how he operates. He's not hobnobbing with celebrities, even though he's a billionaire. He is eating Bojangles fried chicken and spending his time building Epic towards his vision and mission for the future. He bootstrapped forâhow long did we say it was? Was it 22 years before...?\n\nBen: Twenty-two years before taking the Tencent money.\n\nDavid: Twenty-two years before taking the Tencent money.\n\nBen: Yeah, so I mean on the one hand, yes, you're right. It's absolutely this reflection of Timâs personality. On the other hand, we're comparing it to these companies like Uber that are moving people around their cities. And Fortnite makes money by selling digital hats. They're selling zero marginal cost items that have zero distribution costs, and they're selling a ton of them because of social proof.\n\nDavid: You're pulling forward the playbook theme.\n\nBen: Yeah, but anyway. Would Epic be what they are without the Tencent investment? Absolutely not. If you think back to 2012âprobably 2011 when the conversation startedâthey had no or very little digital distribution expertise. They had most recently shipped Gears of War on some disks to some Xbox customers. They had no live ops experience of running anything like the platforms that they have today that are constantly changing and constantly getting updated and constantly getting new seasons. There were no games as experience.\n\nI think Tim would be the first to tell you. There's a quote that I grabbed here that Tim says which is, âTencent is the number one operator of live games in the world, the number one game publisher in China, and the number three internet company in the world. They're not game developers. Their expertise is how to operate these games on a very large scale and appeal to customers, and we found that their values are very similar to ours and that we have a great deal that we can learn from them.â\n\nI think that was in like the 2013-2014 time frame that he gave that quote. I think not only are they investors, but the leadership team at Epic thinks of them really as strategic advisors, and people who brought them into this Epic 4.0 era of the company.\n\nDavid: Yeah. It's telling that all of the three major strategic moves and then the game development in this new way that have remade Epic all happened after the Tencent investment. It just underscores too this theme serves up so much, even though it's specific to Tencent. That company has been so misunderstood for so long. When the investment happened in 2012âwe didnât talk about this in history and factsâbut a lot of people left Epic because they thought that Tencent coming in meant that they were going to turn into Zinga. They thought of Tencent as free to play. This is not what we want to build. This is not how you build real games.\n\nThe reality was it was totally wrong. It was this whole new version of a much more sustainable, more democratic way of building games, and vision for the industry. And people are only now just starting to wake up to that reality of Tencent.\n\nBen: It's absolutely right. Playbook?\n\nDavid: Playbook, let's do it. Okay, so Ben, you mentioned virtual digital zeroâ¦\n\nBen: Selling hats.\n\nDavid: Zero marginal cost goods, say more about that.\n\nBen: Yeah, it is literally the greatest business model of all time to have the fixed cost and frankly, not even the large fixed costs of designing a new piece of virtual garb, a character, a skin, or using the tools that Epic has built. It is not. It is a lot of work for an animator to do thisârigor, and all the other things involved, but it's not crazy. It's 1-5 people doing it for less than a couple of months and in some cases, a day. You can sell that thing to 350 million people for $20 each, and it costs zero dollars for you to get to them.\n\nIt is the most incredible operating leverage that you could possibly have on getting something that takes a very small amount of fixed costs to create relative to its distribution, and have zero marginal costs and zero distribution costs in getting it out there.\n\nIt is like the gods of internet business models come down and knighted Epic and said, you have this privilege to just print dollars. And there's an ATM in their backyard that is just spitting out money. I am assigning zero value judgment on that. I'm just saying the reality of the business that they find themselves in is unbelievable.\n\nDavid: This theme that low or zero marginal costs goods make for incredible businesses and business models, I feel is such an important mega theme. I feel like I've been rediscovering this past year, and we've been discovering it on the show. The cool thing is, well two cool things. One, it doesn't only apply to the internet. Once you start to scratch the surface about this idea, you realize it's actually been around for a long time.\n\nBen: Right media was classically this.\n\nDavid: Media was this, yup. And reading The Outsiders really made me think about this.\n\nBen: Media doesn't have the advantage that software has. Aside from maintenance cost, once you make it, then people keep finding value in it over a pseudo infinite time scale. Media generally has a shelf life and then you have to create more media, which is the same thing in Fortnite to be fair.\n\nDavid: It's multiple types in the media business. There's the content part of the media business that you're talking about. There's also the distribution part of the media business. Now, this has vastly changed with the internet, but I think about John Malone, TCI, and the cable business. That was a business that had incredibly high fixed costs to literally run the cables and launch the satellites for the distribution of signals. But then once you were a cable operator and you had those lines laid into people's homes, it was literally zero marginal cost to keep charging them $100 a month every month.\n\nOnce you start to see this, it really helps me to evaluate business models and start to foresee what a business model of a company is going to be. No matter how successfully you operateâHamilton talks a lot about this in 7 Powers. Operational excellence is super important, and table stakes for becoming a great company, but you have this ceiling of how great you can be based on the economic characteristics of your business and your industry. It comes down, often, to this marginal cost aspect.\n\nBen: And if you just look at the FANG, and I donât want to say FANG because I don't think Netflix deserves to be in it. Let me get to my horse for a moment because I slipped up. FANG should refer to high-paying jobs in the valley at big companies, and people have used it to refer to a set of stocks that should actually include Microsoft, and should not include Netflix, especially from a market cap perspective.\n\nAnyway, if you are looking at the big five tech companies by market cap, much of the same characteristics are present in all of them. Online advertising, the Google model, the Facebook modelâthat's zero marginal cost, zero distribution costs business. You look at the virtueâvirtue is very much the wrong word. You look at the advantages that even Instagram has over YouTube, Instagram doesn't have to pay creators. Whereas YouTube has to pay a cut out to creators. Any business where you are able to charge to distribute something that costs you nothing, and it also costs you nothing to distribute it, that is present in a lot of these companies.\n\nNow, fascinatingly, which Iâll foreshadow before grading, Apple is one of these companies that does not have zero marginal cost, and definitely does not have zero distribution costs. Theirâfor the longest timeâbusiness model is making 35% operating margins on shipping goods to you that are really, really expensive to produce even on a variable basis. Obviously, the R&D is expensive, but the crap in an iPhone is really expensive. It's not like a digital hat. It's no wonder they're trying to get into these services businesses that are creating this clash.\n\nAn interesting takeaway here is Epic has the best business model of all time, and Apple is jealous. That is a little bit of what we are seeing here. But yes David, I think you're exactly right that once you see it, you can't unsee it.\n\nDavid: Totally can't see it. I think there's another theme to highlight here that Epic first stumbled into with the Unreal Engine, but then Tim Sweeney really got religion around and has driven his whole vision now of letting a thousand flowers bloom. This is related to the marginal cost aspect of what you're doing, but it's one thing to make games yourself and invest lots of resources into doing that.\n\nThat's making an assumption that you are going to be right and know what the market is going to want. Tim has a pretty good track record of that, but as we've seen, even he can slip up sometimes. Those three titles that they started working on in 2012, 2013 didn't work. A much better aspect is if you can find a way to just enable entrepreneurship and creativity writ large and be able to say, hey, I don't know what's going to work, but I'm going to let lots and lots of people try and have their shot. That can be way more powerful.\n\nBen: Yeah, what was the phrase we used with Chetan when we had him on the LP Show? Leverage on tinkering, which is any time you can empower a creator to do more with their same skill set, it can be really powerful. What you were describing right now, my notes here are steady platform revenues to smooth hit-driven spik",
      "# [Shopping Cart Empty Icon](https://www.babylist.com/hello-baby/best-bamboo-baby-clothes)\nThere’s certain baby gear you’ll find you just can’t live without. For many parents, bamboo baby clothes fall into that category (in fact, some fans of the fabric refer to themselves as “bamboo moms”). And their love for bamboo baby clothes is not unfounded—this type of fabric is soft, stretchy, breathable and extra-gentle on new baby skin.\n\nWhat Is Bamboo Fabric?\n\nBamboo material is made from the fibers from the fast-growing bamboo plant, which are then blended with other materials (that vary by brand) to make a buttery soft fabric. You may see it called “Bamboo Viscose” or “Bamboo Rayon” depending on what the blend is. One thing to note: due to the process involved in creating the fabric, it doesn’t meet the qualifications needed to be certified organic (except for bamboo linen which is not widely used).\n\nWhy People Love Bamboo Fabric\n\nBamboo clothing has increased in popularity over the last few years. Many parents of babies with eczema-prone skin swear by dressing their babies in bamboo clothing. It’s lightweight, super soft and breathable—all things that sensitive skin needs. The fabric is also extremely stretchy, meaning fast-growing babies and toddlers tend to fit in the pieces for a while. Which is great news, because bamboo clothing also tends to have a higher price tag and makes stocking up on a few pieces worth it.\n\nBamboo baby clothing brands are also well known for designing clothes in unexpected colors and prints, branching out from traditional baby pinks and blues. Some brands stick to more aesthetic, neutral-colored clothes while others carry bright colors and themed prints for every occasion. If you have a particular style in mind for how you want to dress your baby, don’t be afraid to register for a few pieces you love! This can also help people figure out your clothing preferences when shopping for a baby shower gift.\n\nHow to Care For Bamboo Clothing\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that bamboo material does require a bit of TLC when washing—it’s typically recommended to wash on cold and lay flat to dry to increase the garment’s longevity. This will help to prevent pilling and shrinkage. Some parents still throw them in the dryer on low and have no complaints, but be sure to look at the specific care instructions.\n\nIf you’re on the hunt for the best bamboo clothes for your baby, you’re in luck. We rounded up our favorite pieces of bamboo baby clothes and accessories to help you choose.\n\nBabylist’s Picks For The Best Bamboo Baby Clothes",
