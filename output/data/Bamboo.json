      "# [How Turo decreased Host CPA 73% with Bamboo](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/turo)\nTo measure the effectiveness of mobile app campaigns, they also needed to test operating systems (iOS/Android) to determine where paid social investment should be allocated.\n\nBamboo built multiple mobile app install ad variations to test which creative assets and formats worked best; carousel, static image (with and without copy overlay), or video format. The team tested these formats simultaneously with audience targeting including car owners with a single or multi-car household, home-sharers, online car marketplaces, and a lookalike audience built from users who have already listed their cars on Turo.\n\nOn Instagram, the team discovered quickly that static image ads outperformed carousel and video format ads, while on Facebook’s Mobile News Feed, carousel ad format outperformed static and video formats in terms of driving owners to complete listing their vehicle on Turo’s app.",
      "# [How Highlights saw a 65% lift in CVR with Bamboo](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/highlights)\nBamboo simultaneously ran product tag and non-product tag split tests through the Meta A/B testing tool to compare insights. This allowed them to better understand performance and the next steps if a similar test were to be run again.\n\n*Bamboo ran this test in partnership with the Meta marketing science team to ensure a statistically significant result.\n\nWhat are Product Tags?\n\nProduct Tags allow shoppers to seamlessly shop Highlights’ products right on their Facebook feed, moving easily from discovery to final purchase without having to leave the platform. Some of the key benefits of ads with Meta product tags are driving traffic, post engagement, and maximizing the reach of a brand’s shoppable products right on the platform. Shopping ads with product tags can also help businesses grow their pool of shopping Custom Audiences who can be re-engaged with through retargeting ads later on."

Even clumping bamboo spreads quite a bit and it'll fill in. I think anything you plant there will get swallowed up by the bamboo within a couple years.

Down the road, tho, all you'll be looking at is naked canes and the fence. Not attractive. \n\nWhether you add another layer of shrubs or not, your plants and boulders should be thoughtfully selected and angled to shift the leaf litter of the bamboo back towards the base of the plants. \n\nAnd I would do several branched, open habit shrubs bw the bamboo and boulders. They will hide the fence when the bamboo grows tall. Think leafy w open habit (not leggy, tho) vs tight, manicured small leaf like, say, a boxwood. Something that the bamboo litter will fall through and down to the ground vs sticking to it and looking dead and ugly. \n\nWhen you're placing said shrubs and rocks, come out 2' further than where you think it should be.\n\n#### Comment ID gzk8083 with +7 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/landscaping/comments/nlkz8e/what_to_plant_in_front_of_bamboo_hedge/gzk8083/) (in reply to ID gzji537):\nCould always do annuals until the bamboo fills out.\n\n#### Comment ID gzkwymt with +1 score by [(gatt0h, Reddit, 2021-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/landscaping/comments/nlkz8e/what_to_plant_in_front_of_bamboo_hedge/gzkwymt/) (in reply to ID gzji537):\nBlack mondo grass!! You'll never mulch again\n\n#### Comment ID gzlm5fx with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/landscaping/comments/nlkz8e/what_to_plant_in_front_of_bamboo_hedge/gzlm5fx/) (in reply to ID gzji537):\nI like the mondo grass approach  at the base of the bamboo. I'd go with Variegated Mondo Grass (Ophiopogon jaburan ‘Vittatus’).  The variegation will bring the bamboo depth of field closer to the eye. But, since you have a small lot, Black Mondo Grass (Ophiopogon planiscapus ‘Nigrescens’), sometimes labeled as \"Black Dragon' will offer greater depth of field. Either will offer even greater attention to the canes than the lawn alone. However, teh Black Dragon will make the back of the property dark when you already have dark green evergreens along each fence side.    I would not use the variety 'Nana' as it will mimic the high turf getting lost in the process.\n\nAnother option is Japanese Forest Grass Hakonechloa macra \"Aureola'  [http://www.enchantedgardensdesign.com/blog/2018/9/7/hakone-grass-a-four-season-perennial](http://www.enchantedgardensdesign.com/blog/2018/9/7/hakone-grass-a-four-season-perennial).\n\nYet other options are Variegated Japanese Sedge(Carex morrowii 'Aurea-variegata') [https://www.monrovia.com/variegated-japanese-sedge.html](https://www.monrovia.com/variegated-japanese-sedge.html) and Carex oshimensis 'Evergold' [https://www.waltersgardens.com/variety.php?ID=CAREV](https://www.waltersgardens.com/variety.php?ID=CAREV) and Carex morrowii 'Ice Dance' [https://www.monrovia.com/ice-dance-japanese-sedge.html#:\\~:text=Carex%20morrowii%20'Ice%20Dance'&text=A%20lush%20mound%20of%20slender,growing%2C%20non%2Dinvasive%20groundcover](https://www.monrovia.com/ice-dance-japanese-sedge.html#:~:text=Carex%20morrowii%20'Ice%20Dance'&text=A%20lush%20mound%20of%20slender,growing%2C%20non%2Dinvasive%20groundcover).\n\nI also LOVE the idea of a sitting boulder, maybe two, very organic, not formal, maybe one boulder with a depression that holds water,  sandwiched within the bamboo as who doesn't like sitting on a boulder in a grove of bamboo? The boulder, or two, now becomes a destination which I like for your contemplation space.\n\nBamboo looks like Bambusa multiplex 'Golden Goddess'. It will be a striking 8-12 ft high screen if it is! PLEASE don't shear the tops into a formal hedge. Your on center spacing is fine for this well behaved clumping bamboo. NO need to remove every other one. This is a bamboo variety I've used for a privacy screen similar to your design many times. It starts getting cold sensitive around 28\\*. Although it could be a Fargesia. F. robusta, the straight species, maybe? Again, if it is F. robusta you're OK too on the spacing. It gets a bit taller than  Golden Goddess though.  I dont know the variety. \n\nShrubs between bamboo clumps will get swallowed up.\n\n### Comment ID gzmb7oa with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/landscaping/comments/nlkz8e/what_to_plant_in_front_of_bamboo_hedge/gzmb7oa/) (in reply to ID gzjfm9q):\nI have a magnolia Grandiflora planted in between a bamboo border.

If not you and your neighbors won't enjoy it very much in the near future.  It also won't matter what you put in front of it as it will spread very quickly in all directions.\n\nThat aside, you could do something more like a rock garden and plant some sedum stone crop for ground cover.  That will be very hardy and add color.\n\n### Comment ID gzj5sei with +9 score by [(koralex90, Reddit, 2021-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/landscaping/comments/nlkz8e/what_to_plant_in_front_of_bamboo_hedge/gzj5sei/) (in reply to ID gzj5fwi):\nYes it's clumping and right behind is a retaining wall so it cannot go into my neighbors yard.

As large as you can afford. Shoot for 5: 2x 3'x3', 2x 2'x2', and 1 about the size of a basketball. \n\nThe same rules apply outside as they do inside: All of Granny's dolls, Hummel figurines and dishes lining every shelf looks cluttered.

I have hostas that get direct morning and noon sun, then indirect the rest of the day and they do pretty well. They don't get huge, but they're healthy and put up with my careless lawnmowing habits without a problem.  I think you could find a hosta variety that would do ok for you.

It won’t shoot out randomly in the middle of the yard, just expand a few inches radially every year. Will probably start screwing up the grass in 5 years or so, and it’ll require digging out the roots to resize it. A huge PITA, especially if the ground is clay, but not impossible like running bamboo. But it would be vastly easier putting in a barrier now than digging out the roots in a decade.\n\n## Comment ID gzk52s1 with +5 score by [(____blue____, Reddit, 2021-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/landscaping/comments/nlkz8e/what_to_plant_in_front_of_bamboo_hedge/gzk52s1/) (in reply to ID nlkz8e):\nWe've had that bamboo for over two years in our yard.

Im thinking of making my lawn smaller by about 1/3 in front of my bamboo so it will be mulched. Debating whether I should plant anything in front of it after making Lawn smaller.

What ever I plant in front will be shaded from morning and noon sun but will get afternoon sun. Will hostas/japanese forest grass/black mondo grass survive afternoon sun in Zone 8b? If not what suggestions do you have that go well with bamboo but don't obstruct the view of the bamboo? Or should I just not plant anything to highlight the bamboo hedge and simply mulch in front?\n\nCurrently on my backyard I have arborvitae on the left and right side..

It had become a bamboo forest. It ate a giant lilac. It grew so fast you could watch its progress over the course of the day. A couple times shoots came up under the lawn mower and flipped it over. It spread to next to the house and grew between the siding and the outer wall. Our once large yard was reduced by half. \n\nWe tried to kill it.

And most spreading bamboos only occupy the first foot of the soil. \n\nTo remove; take a reciprocating saw with a pruning blade and cut into the soil in a grid pattern (make sure there are no pipes or wires first on or in the soil). Then pop out the clumps with a shovel. (Which should expose the rhizomes in the underside of the clumps.) After you get it all up (by following the rhizomes cutting in a grid), reapply your desired soil in the worked area.\n\nIf you kept the canes uncut, you would now have bamboo divisions for your bamboo loving friends (like me!) The canes on the edge of the Grove are the best divisions as long as they are 3-6 months old.\n\nTo control spreading bamboo; you take into account the top 1' to 2' of soil (as it habitates the top foot of soil) and dig either a 1'-2' deep trench around where you want it to colonize. (As bamboo is awful at adjusting for height, and will poke out the side rather then going under. Just prune off what pokes through). Or dig in a bamboo barrier around where you want it contained.\n\nBamboo is a super sequestrator by the by, and has a use sequestering carbon to fight climate change. And if no inorganic fertilizers are used it feeds mycelial networks too! Plus you can use it to make bio-char!\n\nHope you all found this helpful!\n\n## Comment ID hpjn68i with +6 score by [(Peajy, Reddit, 2021-12-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/rm3bgc/should_i_let_bamboo_take_over_this_part_of_the/hpjn68i/) (in reply to ID rm3bgc):\nBamboo is beautiful, it is also extremely hard wearing and will take over if left to it’s own accord.

The time you spend staying on top of it is time that could be spent doing more beneficial things for your land.  You will pay dearly in your time and sweat to keep a cute little bamboo forest from taking over.\n\n And even if you are responsible, the people who move in after you might think it looks great and just let it go.  That was the case with the people who lived here before I moved in.  It took the better part of 15 years for me to get rid of it.  And there are still traces of it that I have to dig up.

Whether or not it is \"native\" to Pennsylvania is a philosophical question -- it wasn't there 200 (or 20) years ago, but it will naturally and inevitably spread north as the local climate becomes more suitable for it, as will many other Southeastern species.\n\nAs to your original question, in NC nothing native out-competes river cane, but a lot of things can grow alongside it.

Our neighbors kept theirs for a bit, but I think they removed it by now.\n\n## Comment ID kin4c62 with +2 score by [(sami_sees, Reddit, 2024-01-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NativePlantGardening/comments/19aj2nb/native_plant_that_outcompetes_bamboo/kin4c62/) (in reply to ID 19aj2nb):\nI haven't used herbicide near water so you'd need something specific for that application, but I've been cutting and treating. I take a sawzall right down as close to the ground as I can get and immediately treat the stump. Cutting alone will also help to slow growth.\n\nIf you're cutting, you want to try to get as close to the ground because what's left will be a serious trip hazard, especially if working in the area with tools. I honestly scoot around on my butt for ease and safety because I've tripped a few times and my bamboo is on top of a retaining wall. If you cut too high it can also leave a cup that water accumulates in and is perfect for mosquito larva. \n\nIf it's running bamboo, there will be significant material underground. It's not easy to remove in my experience as it's thick and rigid and intertwined, but maybe that's just me. I'm trying to wait it out and see what happens over winter and if it's any easier to dig out next summer, but best bet would be to excavate it out. I mention this because it may impact your ability to plant in the area for a while if you can't dig through the roots, or if you need to bring heavy equipment. \n\nI'm just shy of 2 years with my bamboo and I'm told to expect to deal with it for many more. I'm expecting consistent supervision of the area for years to catch any new growth early and to prep the ground for replanting.\n\n## Comment ID kinr150 with +2 score by [(PM_ME_TUS_GRILLOS, Reddit, 2024-01-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NativePlantGardening/comments/19aj2nb/native_plant_that_outcompetes_bamboo/kinr150/) (in reply to ID 19aj2nb):\nI think you have enough advice about eradication already (herbicide ftw). \n\n\nIf you grow veggies or vines, bamboo canes can be used to make trellises or fences.

The offshoots can punch right through. If you haven't already, I'd suggest at least a good 3 ft tall piece of metal sheet against your wall under the surface to prevent the need to excise all the bamboo later to dig out the area for repairs to your home.

I learned from my neighbor that the bamboo had originated 4 houses down the block and had even crossed the alley at one point.  I ended up having to knock on doors so that all 6 homeowners with infested yards could cut down their bamboo and treat the stumps at the same time.  One homeowner was elderly and too poor to hire anyone to get rid of it; another was a landlord who didn't care.  The other homeowners pitched in to get rid of it in their yards \n\nI spent hours and hours over 4 months getting rid of the bamboo in my yard and in the alley behind my house, an area that was probably 40'×45' of solid bamboo.  By the time I was done getting rid of it, I had carpal tunnel in both hands and had trigger fingers in all my fingers except my left pinky.  The inflammation got so bad I had to go on prednisone for several weeks.  Even after cutting down all the existing stalks, it took 3 more years of destroying the new growth after every rain before it was completely gone.\n\nThe reason I typed all this up is to illustrate how serious I am when I say that if I were your neighbor I would hate your guts and would seek out every legal remedy I could, including filing a lawsuit.\n\n## Comment ID isw6k6r with +9 score by [(hotttsauce84, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AustinGardening/comments/y7ev5y/best_plants_to_coplantcompanion_plant_with_bamboo/isw6k6r/) (in reply to ID y7ev5y):\nI know you probably don’t want to hear this because it’s likely you spent money to have that bamboo planted, but as others have said, remove it immediately.

Palm Trees are not made out of what we call wood, its an example of how hard it can be to categorize things as any physical characteristics you pick are not uniform.  \n\nOak trees are more related to orchids than pine trees, grouping by genetics doesn't work either.  Tree's are sometime given as an example of convergent evolution, where distinct groups develop similar traits.  We lump those groups in as \"trees\" when really there is no set way to distinguish what is or isn't a tree.    \n\n\n[Quick little vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSmurp1xOkQ) I'm getting this from.\n\n### Comment ID i1cvr68 with +25 score by [(Gastronomicus, Reddit, 2022-03-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ti10nj/til_palm_trees_arent_trees_theyre_just_massive/i1cvr68/) (in reply to ID i1btak9):\nTrue, but [secondary growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_growth) is often used to define what is a shrub or tree.

Why would you name them all different types of biguns (made up word borrowed from LOTF)\n\n## Comment ID lnpoh6o with +1 score by [(yaoguai666, Reddit, 2024-09-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ti10nj/til_palm_trees_arent_trees_theyre_just_massive/lnpoh6o/) (in reply to ID ti10nj):\nTrees are not a monophyletic taxonomic group but consist of a wide variety of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight.\n\nMeaning that any family of plant can convergently evolve to be what you layman's call trees\n\n## Comment ID i1db2q6 with +1 score by [(ulises314, Reddit, 2022-03-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ti10nj/til_palm_trees_arent_trees_theyre_just_massive/i1db2q6/) (in reply to ID ti10nj):\nAll trees are just massive plants, aren’t they?\n\n## Comment ID i1cko47 with +1 score by [(Pongfarang, Reddit, 2022-03-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ti10nj/til_palm_trees_arent_trees_theyre_just_massive/i1cko47/) (in reply to ID ti10nj):\nYou can use the wood of a palm tree to make stuff, I know a guy who built a building with coconut palm pillars. and you buy carved items in coconut wood. But bananas trees have nothing like wood. You can cut them in half with one good machete swing. Bamboo is essentially hardwood, so dense it doesn't float unless there is an air pocket. But Bamboo is a type of grass.\n\n## Comment ID i1co0a1 with +1 score by [(AngelSucked, Reddit, 2022-03-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ti10nj/til_palm_trees_arent_trees_theyre_just_massive/i1co0a1/) (in reply to ID ti10nj):\nWhich is why is sucks if* you have to cut one down. These things are the graveyard of chainsaws and pole axe blades.\n\n## Comment ID i1e407w with +1 score by [(Needmoresnakes, Reddit, 2022-03-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ti10nj/til_palm_trees_arent_trees_theyre_just_massive/i1e407w/) (in reply to ID ti10nj):\nWords have different uses in different contexts. A biologist cares more about cladistics but laypeople are usually applying more utilitarian semantics.\n\nIf I need a landmark or a bit of shade or something to cut down and use as a bridge or whatever, tree is a perfectly useful word.\n\nCladistics is great when you need to be specific and exact but isn't helpful in lots of other scenarios.\n\nIt's not that palm trees aren't trees or that trees don't exist, it's just different meanings in different contexts.\n\n## Comment ID i1fd1o6 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-03-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ti10nj/til_palm_trees_arent_trees_theyre_just_massive/i1fd1o6/) (in reply to ID ti10nj):\nIt would be helpful if someone could explain the difference between a tree and a plant bc I don’t know"

It sounds like you worked here in the early days of the creative team when it was separated as an R&amp;D effort, but you'll be happy to know that is no longer the case. Creative team members are integrated into account teams now and are extremely central to what we do! \n\n2. I am no longer involved in sales and I definitely agree with your critique. Account teams are now involved pre-sale for the clients they would be owning and it's going a lot smoother as a result!\n\n3. The \"group project\" call out is fair, though I think that was mostly due to our matrixed org structure. It made things difficult for us as we outgrew it. It was often unclear who the one person responsible for various things were. Too many approvals and too much consensus was required. We're now reorganizing into pods to fix this empower more leaders across the business. Definitely agree and understand this critique from the past though!\n\n4. The one thing I have to call out is that we are not and have never been \"a revolving door of clients\". We have very strong client retention and that has always been the case. I'm not sure if this happened on your clients specifically but I want to assure future team members and clients that this is not the case.\n\nThanks for what you put into Bamboo and again, I hope you found a better fit!",

Even when debating whether to leave to pursue a dream career change, everyone was very supportive and positive. Bamboo really celebrates the accomplishments of all its employees (current and former) out of genuine care.\r\n\r\nFairly solid benefits in terms of health, dental, and vision, with stock options, flexible PTO (and you are actually encouraged to use it) and a generous but reasonable work from home policy. The work-life balance is also very good. \r\nMinor perks include a lounge stocked with snacks and a rotating schedule for people to bring their dogs into the office - as long as they're well behaved. \r\n\r\nThe team environment is great. Everyone is very friendly and casual and tries to make the day enjoyable, though will also be respectful and professional where needed. Management works hard to resolve even minor interpersonal conflicts from differences in work style so that everyone is content. There are many opportunities to connect with others inside and outside of work, though no major peer pressure as can sometimes occur at startups or in agency environments. Even during the pandemic, Bamboo did its best to attend to employee needs and set up virtual social events, from yoga and workouts to language lessons to involved happy hours.",

Even when debating whether to leave to pursue a dream career change, everyone was very supportive and positive. Bamboo really celebrates the accomplishments of all its employees (current and former) out of genuine care.\r\n\r\nFairly solid benefits in terms of health, dental, and vision, with stock options, flexible PTO (and you are actually encouraged to use it) and a generous but reasonable work from home policy. The work-life balance is also very good. \r\nMinor perks include a lounge stocked with snacks and a rotating schedule for people to bring their dogs into the office - as long as they're well behaved. \r\n\r\nThe team environment is great. Everyone is very friendly and casual and tries to make the day enjoyable, though will also be respectful and professional where needed. Management works hard to resolve even minor interpersonal conflicts from differences in work style so that everyone is content. There are many opportunities to connect with others inside and outside of work, though no major peer pressure as can sometimes occur at startups or in agency environments.

      "# [How To Grow And Care For Bamboo by Steve Bender, www.facebook.com on 2016-11-11](https://www.southernliving.com/garden/perennials/how-to-grow-bamboo)\nBamboo (Bambusa vulgaris) is an evergreen perennial that grows in running and clumping formations. Running bamboo spreads faster than the clumping variety, making it highly invasive in environments where the growth goes unchecked. Native to Asia, this tropical and sub-tropical plant has several cultivar varieties.\n\nThe thick stems grow vertically in loose clumps but do not contain any thorns. Relatively strong, the common bamboo has yellow stems, or culms, with dark green foliage that emerges new in the spring. The continuous foliage and quick growth rate make common bamboo an excellent option as a privacy hedge. Plant in late spring or early fall.\n\nNote that raw bamboo culms and leaves contain toxins and people shouldn't eat them raw. However, there are specific varieties whose young shoots are edible and are considered non-toxic to pets and people.\n\nPlant Attributes\n\nBamboo Care\n\nPlant container-grown bamboo any time of year. Clumping bamboo often requires a barrier or garden stakes on one side to help the plant adjust to the desired shape as it grows in an enlarging circle. Use this variety away from fences or sidewalks and maintain its invasive spread by breaking off new shoots when the growth exceeds its space.\n\nLarge expanses of concrete or asphalt won't prevent the spread of running bamboo, but it isn't difficult to contain them—provided you understand how they grow. Rhizomes are shallow and spread sideways, not down. To prevent the horizontal spread of bamboo, block, cut, or surround the rhizomes with a trench.\n\nBamboo needs consistent watering and fertilizer while establishing and growing. Keep the soil moist but well-drained, and amend it with rich, fertile nutrients if required.\n\nLight\n\nCommon bamboo needs daily sun exposure to grow to its fullest potential. Provide plants with at least six hours of sunlight daily in moderately warm areas. In areas with harsher summer climates, the partial shade will provide bamboo with some relief from the afternoon sun. Bamboo grows well in environments with ample light and humidity.\n\nSoil\n\nBamboo thrives in moist, well-drained soil but will tolerate most soil types as long as it is not soggy or too dry. Use a slightly acid soil pH and balance the soil's nutrients with fertilizer if necessary. If growing bamboo in containers, use potting soil with organic compost, such as mushrooms.\n\nWater\n\nWater bamboo frequently and deeply for best growth and wet the soil around the plant to a few inches deep. Established plants tolerate considerable drought but look best with regular irrigation. If grown indoors, use a spray bottle to help amplify the humidity surrounding the bamboo.\n\nTemperature and Humidity\n\nNative to tropical and sub-tropical environments, bamboo grows best in humid areas with moist soil. Common bamboo grows naturally near river banks and open ground and tolerates various climate conditions. Depending on the variety, bamboo will defoliate during the dry season and grow new foliage during the rainy season or spring. Optimal temperatures range from 65°F to 90°F, but a cold-hardy bamboo variety can tolerate temperatures near 10°F.\n\nFertilizer\n\nFeed in-ground plants monthly, from March to October, with a high-nitrogen fertilizer or lawn fertilizer. Using a balanced fertilizer throughout the growing season helps plants to provide nutrients to the roots and keeps the bamboo healthy. Cut back on water and fertilizer to restrict the size and spread of an established bamboo.\n\nTypes of Bamboo\n\nThere is a diverse variety of bamboo to grow in gardens or containers. Depending on your space availability and growing environment, some species are better suited for different conditions. Here are only a few of the available selections:\n\n'Buddha's Belly' (Bambusa ventricosa): This plant grows well indoors, reaching about 5 to 8 feet tall in a container. It is adaptable to various conditions, and the culms grow in a unique, zigzagging formation.\n\n'Chilean Bamboo' (Chusquea culeou): Native to Latin America, this species has solid culms that grow up to 20 feet. This variety's solid stems make it an excellent option for a privacy screen or to use as a focal point in your garden.\n\n'Broad-leaf Bamboo' (Sasa Palmata): A tropical, running bamboo species with highly resilient growth, this plant tolerates shady environments.\n\n'Blue Bamboo' (Himalayacalamus hookerianus): This evergreen, clump-forming bamboo has slender and elegant culms, each containing a hint of red or purple coloring on top of its blue stems that mature to gold.\n\nPruning\n\nPrune bamboo any time during the year, but prevent accidentally removing emerging shoots during the growing season. Much of the pruning needed for bamboo plants is to maintain shape and appearance. Start by removing older, dead, or unsightly culms with a saw or sharp garden shears. Remove these unwanted culms to the ground, or cut above the node if you are pruning for appearance.\n\nDepending on the bamboo variety, running bamboo species must block the plant's surrounding area to avoid unwanted spread. A continuous polypropylene plastic sheet around the perimeter of the planting helps to block the space, but remember to keep a 2-inch lip above ground to stop runners. Never place plastic under roots, as they need excellent drainage. Continuously drying the soil, extending 10 to 20 feet beyond the planting bed, impedes runners.\n\nAnother effective pruning solution is to periodically insert a spade to its full length around the plant, severing the rhizomes and isolating unwanted parts from the main plant. Break off new shoots that rise from the isolated rhizomes, so they are unlikely to resprout. Surrounding the plant with an 18-inch deep and 1-foot wide trench can provide an opening to remove any emerging rhizomes. Fill the trench with loose mulch or sand, then use a spading fork several times a year to search the trench for roving rhizomes and easily sever.\n\nPropagating Bamboo\n\nThe best time to propagate bamboo from existing clumps is just before growth begins in the spring. Here is how to propagate bamboo by dividing culms or rhizome cuttings:\n\nDuring March or April (for hardy varieties) or May or early June (for tropical varieties), roots with at least three culms are divided using a sharp pruning shear or spade. Do not cut or spread the root ball, which will kill the canes.\n\nCut back the tops to balance the loss of roots and rhizomes. Don't worry if the foliage wilts because new growth will emerge from the missing culms.\n\nIf propagating from a clumping bamboo species, cut the rhizome with a garden spade from the root ball. Running bamboo will have a foot-long rhizome with roots and buds.\n\nAfter removing the section of bamboo from cuttings or the root ball, plant the new divisions in rich soil filled with organic material. Continue watering and maintain a moist, well-drained growing environment.\n\nHow to Grow Bamboo From Seed\n\nGrowing bamboo from seeds is challenging but possible in the right conditions. Here is how to grow bamboo from seeds:\n\nBamboo seeds need humidity to grow, so create a greenhouse if you do not own one. Start with a seed tray, bamboo seeds, pellets, and a container large enough to enclose the tray—creating a greenhouse atmosphere.\n\nFill each spot in the seed starting tray with a pellet and add water to cover it, filling the individual containers about halfway. Use clean water and let the pellets soak until expanding. Remove excess water.\n\nFill a container with clean water and submerge the bamboo seeds for up to 24 hours. Keep the seeds in a warm area.\n\nUse a pencil or fingers to create a hole in each pellet, which will plant one seed in each area. Make sure the seeds are completely covered. Place in a room with indirect sunlight and keep pellets moist. Continue care until sprouts reach the greenhouse container's top, then transplant them into a larger container to grow until it's time to move the plant outdoors.\n\nPotting and Repotting Bamboo\n\nWhen growing bamboo in a container, it might be necessary to repot the plant once it outgrows its current space. As an aggressive spreader, bamboo—especially running bamboo—can quickly overgrow if not maintained.\n\nStart with a sturdy, well-draining container with similar depth and width. Fill the container with rich potting soil, enough to cover the top of the root ball. Transplant the root ball in the new container, but do not pack the plant too deeply, as this can cause rot. Leave air pockets in the soil and water thoroughly. Depending on your preferences, continue repotting bamboo or gently divide the rhizomes to maintain shape and appearance.\n\nOverwintering\n\nAfter establishing growth, bamboo plants are relatively cold-hardy in USDA Zones 4-10. Planting bamboo in the spring is best to allow culms to emerge and take root before experiencing colder conditions. Adding mulch to the plant during its first winter season is recommended when planted outdoors. If using a container to grow bamboo, move the plant indoors before the first frost.\n\nCommon Pests & Plant Diseases\n\nScale, mealybugs, and aphids occasionally appear on bamboo but seldom do any harm. Spray with insecticidal soap or summer oil if these pests excrete honeydew in bothersome amounts. Mites can cause yellow streaking or disfigurement of leaves, which insecticidal soap can also control.\n\nRoot rot can occur in bamboo plants that do not have adequate circulation or wet growing environments. This soil-borne disease causes roots to appear darker or slimy. Use a sharp knife to remove damaged or mushy roots and prevent spreading by eliminating the culms above. Water the plant's base in the morning to prevent foliage from developing a fungus.\n\nCommon Problems With Bamboo\n\nBamboo plants are relatively free from problems and only require some maintenance. Your bamboo plant might need more water, soil nutrients, or sun exposure.\n\nCurling Leaves\n\nAdequate watering balance is one of the most challenging parts of caring for bamboo plants. Curling leaves signify underwatering. Without any other changes, changing the watering schedule is all that's needed to resolve this issue. Water plants once or twice a week at the plant's base. Different conditions, like container plants and harsh summer heat, might require watering more often.\n\nDrooping Leaves\n\nBamboo plants require a lot of nitrogen-rich fertilizer. Use organic compost at the beginning of the growing season in the spring and again in mid to late summer. Extra feeding can help revive the thinning plant when the foliage looks unhealthy. Brown leaves can signify too much fertilizer, so don't overfeed bamboo.\n\nLeaves Turning Brown\n\nToo much direct or harsh sunlight can cause bamboo plants' leaves to turn brown. Overwatering and underwatering can also cause an imbalance in soil nutrients, creating brown leaves. If possible, move bamboo to an area with indirect or filtered sunlight.",
      "# [13 Plants You Should Never Grow Next to Hydrangeas by Michelle Mastro, www.facebook.com on 2024-07-24](https://www.marthastewart.com/what-not-to-plant-next-to-hydrangeas-8680041)\nHydrangeas are some of the most beautiful flowering shrubs. Known for their spectacular blooms in a range of colors, they work great in a late summer or early fall garden. However, it turns out that some plants don’t play well with hydrangeas. These plants include other flowers, trees, vegetables, and herbs, many of which prefer other soil types or need different care. Some even emit chemicals that are harmful to hydrangeas and other flowers.\n\nAhead, we spoke to garden experts about which plants to keep away from your hydrangeas to ensure that these showy shrubs thrive.\n\nChristine Schaub, host of the home and garden YouTube show Come on Over\n\nAndrew Connolly, owner of Little Flower Cottage, a seller of flowers\n\nEvan Torchio, expert arborist and founder of Tree Menders\n\n01 of 13\n\nThyme\n\nA woody herb, thyme prefers dry soil, the opposite of what hydrangeas like. \"Thyme is often drought-tolerant and wilts in the kind of moisture hydrangeas crave,\" says Christine Schaub, host of the YouTube show Come on Over. As an herb, thyme also tends to thrive in the sunniest of sunny locations, something tender hydrangea leaves reject, she says.\n\n02 of 13\n\nBlack Walnut\n\nThis tree produces juglone, a chemical harmful to many plants. \"Specifically, juglone stunts the growth of hydrangeas by stopping water uptake,\" says Andrew Connolly, owner of Little Flower Cottage, a seller of flowers.\n\n03 of 13\n\nEucalyptus\n\nEucalyptus trees don’t do well with hydrangeas. \"Eucalyptus are heavy feeders and can deplete the soil of the most essential nutrients,\" says Connolly. Thus, the hydrangeas will become malnourished next to the eucalyptus and might not be able to flower.\n\n04 of 13\n\nLavender\n\nNever plant lavender next to hydrangeas. \"Lavender is notoriously finicky about soil moisture, humidity, and sun,\" says Schaub. Since it hails from the Mediterranean, lavender prefers dry, rocky, sandy conditions, conditions a hydrangea plant can’t cope with. \"And lavender will let you know it’s unhappy by turning yellow, then brown, and the hollow stem will snap right off,\" she says.\n\n05 of 13\n\nDaffodils\n\nDaffodils can be toxic to other plants. \"Their roots secret a substance that inhibits the growth of any neighboring plants,\" says Connolly.\n\n06 of 13\n\nMarigolds\n\nWhile a great companion plant for many herbs and vegetables, marigolds do not get along with hydrangeas. \"These orange-toned beauties want sun all day, every day. And they like their 'feet' in drier conditions,\" says Schaub. If placed in moist ground that hydrangeas like, your marigolds will droop, turn yellow, and eventually die.\n\n07 of 13\n\nBamboo\n\nTechnically a species of grass, bamboo shouldn’t grow next to just any plant. \"Bamboo can cast too much shade, depriving hydrangeas of the sunlight they need,\" says Evan Torchio, founder of Tree Menders. Plus, certain bamboo varieties are considered invasive, as they spread aggressively and therefore should be kept in a confined space like a concrete planter away from native plants.\n\n08 of 13\n\nLimelight Hydrangea\n\nSurprisingly, not all hydrangea varieties get along. \"Planting different hydrangea varieties too close together can lead to cross-pollination issues,\" says Connolly. And placing too many different hydrangeas on top of each other can impact the color and intensity of their flowers, especially in closely related hydrangea species.\n\n09 of 13\n\nRoses\n\nRoses can compete with hydrangeas for nutrients and water. This is particularly true in small gardens. \"Additionally, some rose varieties may prefer different soil conditions than hydrangeas,\" says Torchio.\n\n10 of 13\n\nLilac\n\nA flowering bush, lilac is an aggressive grower. \"It can quickly outcompete other plants for resources,\" says Torchio. Plus, these flowers prefer well-drained soil, the opposite of what hydrangeas like.\n\n11 of 13\n\nAnemone\n\nAnemone blooms in mid-to-late summer just like hydrangeas, but these flowers should never be planted together. Hydrangeas grow big, towering over this low-lying plant. \"If the anemone base is too shaded, it will not bloom, and then you’ll miss the best part of this hardy plant,\" says Schaub.\n\n12 of 13\n\nGarlic\n\nGarlic and hydrangeas don’t get along. \"While not commonly planted in ornamental gardens, garlic can affect the growth of floral plants like hydrangeas,\" says Connolly. This is because garlic releases allelopathic chemicals that can harm flowers.\n\n13 of 13\n\nSunflowers\n\nKnown for their height, sunflowers can shade out hydrangeas. \"Also, some studies suggest that sunflowers may have allelopathic properties, releasing chemicals that can inhibit the growth of nearby plants,\" says Torchio.",
