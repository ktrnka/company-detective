She figured they’d get tall and bushy and block our view of the neighboring yard. \n\nThe bamboo thrived. It got tall. It got bushy. It spread all over our yard and every neighboring yard. It had become a bamboo forest. It ate a giant lilac. It grew so fast you could watch its progress over the course of the day. A couple times shoots came up under the lawn mower and flipped it over. It spread to next to the house and grew between the siding and the outer wall. Our once large yard was reduced by half. \n\nWe tried to kill it. We whacked it down with big knives, and sprayed poison all over the place. It was too late. The bamboo won. It’s still there. Thirty years later I drive past the place and the entire back yard is stuffed with bamboo. \n\nWhenever anyone says they want to plant bamboo, this is what I tell them.

Many of the natives are not going to thrive with the weather weirding and increasing toxification/disruption of our planet.\n\nNon-natives are going to play a role in our future existence, some are not going anywhere anytime soon, and some will be naturalized at some point down the line. We need a broader vision of natives vs non-natives. It is not black and white and there are infinite gray areas.\n\n### Comment ID hplqm5o with +3 score by [(caribeno, Reddit, 2021-12-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/rm3bgc/should_i_let_bamboo_take_over_this_part_of_the/hplqm5o/) (in reply to ID hpk6jpv):\nNursery people often push invasive.

See how the shoots are popping up in lines? That's most likely marking an underground root system.

And most spreading bamboos only occupy the first foot of the soil. \n\nTo remove; take a reciprocating saw with a pruning blade and cut into the soil in a grid pattern (make sure there are no pipes or wires first on or in the soil). Then pop out the clumps with a shovel. (Which should expose the rhizomes in the underside of the clumps.) After you get it all up (by following the rhizomes cutting in a grid), reapply your desired soil in the worked area.\n\nIf you kept the canes uncut, you would now have bamboo divisions for your bamboo loving friends (like me!) The canes on the edge of the Grove are the best divisions as long as they are 3-6 months old.\n\nTo control spreading bamboo; you take into account the top 1' to 2' of soil (as it habitates the top foot of soil) and dig either a 1'-2' deep trench around where you want it to colonize. (As bamboo is awful at adjusting for height, and will poke out the side rather then going under. Just prune off what pokes through). Or dig in a bamboo barrier around where you want it contained.\n\nBamboo is a super sequestrator by the by, and has a use sequestering carbon to fight climate change. And if no inorganic fertilizers are used it feeds mycelial networks too! Plus you can use it to make bio-char!\n\nHope you all found this helpful!\n\n## Comment ID hpjn68i with +4 score by [(Peajy, Reddit, 2021-12-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/rm3bgc/should_i_let_bamboo_take_over_this_part_of_the/hpjn68i/) (in reply to ID rm3bgc):\nBamboo is beautiful, it is also extremely hard wearing and will take over if left to it’s own accord.

Down the road, tho, all you'll be looking at is naked canes and the fence. Not attractive. \n\nWhether you add another layer of shrubs or not, your plants and boulders should be thoughtfully selected and angled to shift the leaf litter of the bamboo back towards the base of the plants. \n\nAnd I would do several branched, open habit shrubs bw the bamboo and boulders. They will hide the fence when the bamboo grows tall. Think leafy w open habit (not leggy, tho) vs tight, manicured small leaf like, say, a boxwood. Something that the bamboo litter will fall through and down to the ground vs sticking to it and looking dead and ugly. \n\nWhen you're placing said shrubs and rocks, come out 2' further than where you think it should be.\n\n#### Comment ID gzk8083 with +7 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/landscaping/comments/nlkz8e/what_to_plant_in_front_of_bamboo_hedge/gzk8083/) (in reply to ID gzji537):\nCould always do annuals until the bamboo fills out.\n\n#### Comment ID gzkwymt with +1 score by [(gatt0h, Reddit, 2021-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/landscaping/comments/nlkz8e/what_to_plant_in_front_of_bamboo_hedge/gzkwymt/) (in reply to ID gzji537):\nBlack mondo grass!!

I'd go with Variegated Mondo Grass (Ophiopogon jaburan ‘Vittatus’).  The variegation will bring the bamboo depth of field closer to the eye. But, since you have a small lot, Black Mondo Grass (Ophiopogon planiscapus ‘Nigrescens’), sometimes labeled as \"Black Dragon' will offer greater depth of field. Either will offer even greater attention to the canes than the lawn alone. However, teh Black Dragon will make the back of the property dark when you already have dark green evergreens along each fence side.    I would not use the variety 'Nana' as it will mimic the high turf getting lost in the process.\n\nAnother option is Japanese Forest Grass Hakonechloa macra \"Aureola'  [http://www.enchantedgardensdesign.com/blog/2018/9/7/hakone-grass-a-four-season-perennial](http://www.enchantedgardensdesign.com/blog/2018/9/7/hakone-grass-a-four-season-perennial).\n\nYet other options are Variegated Japanese Sedge(Carex morrowii 'Aurea-variegata') [https://www.monrovia.com/variegated-japanese-sedge.html](https://www.monrovia.com/variegated-japanese-sedge.html) and Carex oshimensis 'Evergold' [https://www.waltersgardens.com/variety.php?ID=CAREV](https://www.waltersgardens.com/variety.php?ID=CAREV) and Carex morrowii 'Ice Dance' [https://www.monrovia.com/ice-dance-japanese-sedge.html#:\\~:text=Carex%20morrowii%20'Ice%20Dance'&text=A%20lush%20mound%20of%20slender,growing%2C%20non%2Dinvasive%20groundcover](https://www.monrovia.com/ice-dance-japanese-sedge.html#:~:text=Carex%20morrowii%20'Ice%20Dance'&text=A%20lush%20mound%20of%20slender,growing%2C%20non%2Dinvasive%20groundcover).\n\nI also LOVE the idea of a sitting boulder, maybe two, very organic, not formal, maybe one boulder with a depression that holds water,  sandwiched within the bamboo as who doesn't like sitting on a boulder in a grove of bamboo? The boulder, or two, now becomes a destination which I like for your contemplation space.\n\nBamboo looks like Bambusa multiplex 'Golden Goddess'. It will be a striking 8-12 ft high screen if it is! PLEASE don't shear the tops into a formal hedge. Your on center spacing is fine for this well behaved clumping bamboo. NO need to remove every other one. This is a bamboo variety I've used for a privacy screen similar to your design many times. It starts getting cold sensitive around 28\\*. Although it could be a Fargesia. F. robusta, the straight species, maybe? Again, if it is F. robusta you're OK too on the spacing. It gets a bit taller than  Golden Goddess though.  I dont know the variety. \n\nShrubs between bamboo clumps will get swallowed up.\n\n### Comment ID gzmb7oa with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/landscaping/comments/nlkz8e/what_to_plant_in_front_of_bamboo_hedge/gzmb7oa/) (in reply to ID gzjfm9q):\nI have a magnolia Grandiflora planted in between a bamboo border.

It won’t shoot out randomly in the middle of the yard, just expand a few inches radially every year.

Im thinking of making my lawn smaller by about 1/3 in front of my bamboo so it will be mulched. Debating whether I should plant anything in front of it after making Lawn smaller.

Or should I just not plant anything to highlight the bamboo hedge and simply mulch in front?\n\nCurrently on my backyard I have arborvitae on the left and right side..

I take a sawzall right down as close to the ground as I can get and immediately treat the stump. Cutting alone will also help to slow growth.\n\nIf you're cutting, you want to try to get as close to the ground because what's left will be a serious trip hazard, especially if working in the area with tools. I honestly scoot around on my butt for ease and safety because I've tripped a few times and my bamboo is on top of a retaining wall. If you cut too high it can also leave a cup that water accumulates in and is perfect for mosquito larva. \n\nIf it's running bamboo, there will be significant material underground. It's not easy to remove in my experience as it's thick and rigid and intertwined, but maybe that's just me. I'm trying to wait it out and see what happens over winter and if it's any easier to dig out next summer, but best bet would be to excavate it out. I mention this because it may impact your ability to plant in the area for a while if you can't dig through the roots, or if you need to bring heavy equipment. \n\nI'm just shy of 2 years with my bamboo and I'm told to expect to deal with it for many more.

I recently had some clumping bamboo planted in my backyard and want to intersperse some other plants on the ground. Each bamboo is spaced about six feet apart and the barrier is about two feet wide. The plants will be on the same irrigation as the bamboo, aka will gets lots of water. There’s also direct light for a couple hours each day, but the plants will be heavily shadowed by the bamboo and two trees I have. I’d love something that flowers, but my priority is something that will thrive. I’m a somewhat novice gardener so hopefully nothing too temperamental. (My pupper is curious, but not destructive so okay if it pet friendly per se.)

I learned from my neighbor that the bamboo had originated 4 houses down the block and had even crossed the alley at one point.  I ended up having to knock on doors so that all 6 homeowners with infested yards could cut down their bamboo and treat the stumps at the same time.  One homeowner was elderly and too poor to hire anyone to get rid of it; another was a landlord who didn't care.  The other homeowners pitched in to get rid of it in their yards \n\nI spent hours and hours over 4 months getting rid of the bamboo in my yard and in the alley behind my house, an area that was probably 40'×45' of solid bamboo.  By the time I was done getting rid of it, I had carpal tunnel in both hands and had trigger fingers in all my fingers except my left pinky.  The inflammation got so bad I had to go on prednisone for several weeks.  Even after cutting down all the existing stalks, it took 3 more years of destroying the new growth after every rain before it was completely gone.\n\nThe reason I typed all this up is to illustrate how serious I am when I say that if I were your neighbor I would hate your guts and would seek out every legal remedy I could, including filing a lawsuit.\n\n## Comment ID isw6k6r with +9 score by [(hotttsauce84, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AustinGardening/comments/y7ev5y/best_plants_to_coplantcompanion_plant_with_bamboo/isw6k6r/) (in reply to ID y7ev5y):\nI know you probably don’t want to hear this because it’s likely you spent money to have that bamboo planted, but as others have said, remove it immediately. Your future self will thank you. Not only do you risk pissing off all of your neighbors for a 50 yard radius, and even if you don’t plan to live there for more than a couple years so don’t care about the long-term headache, you also severely risk fucking up the resale value of your home. When home shopping recently, I came across two homes that I absolutely loved but 1000% refused to even consider because of established bamboo that I knew was going to be several months—if not years—of a headache and massive expense to remove.

I need some help with clearing bamboo and wisteria from our backyard. Our neighbors and I have been working hard to mitigate the wisteria, and our yard and the house behind us have bamboo. They said they are willing to get rid of it, but we don’t know where to start! Do we just fill the ground, or do we start cutting it down?

I've been fighting it for a few years. I have the Chinese variety ripping apart my fence and it's worse than kudzu, IME.\n\nBamboo is cutting, stomping new shoots, and mowing to maintain.

I think the latter can affect nearby plants when used on cut stumps, but I could be mistaken.   Dye added to the solution helps you see where you've used it.  You can buy indicator colorant, but I know some folks just use food coloring, which is temporary.  I don't do foliar applications of herbicide because I don't want to have issues with overspray on other plants/animals.  Cut stump  is my preferred method.  \n\n\n[Link from University of Florida's Center for Invasive Plants](http://plants.ifas.ufl.edu/plant-directory/wisteria-sinensis/)\n\n## Comment ID fsbo9n4 with +2 score by [(lordnecro, Reddit, 2020-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/gtgxun/help_with_wisteria_and_bamboo/fsbo9n4/) (in reply to ID gtgxun):\nI had a massive battle with wisteria.\n\nThe roots are very strong, using weed killer or just cutting the visible parts will do nothing.

We dug it up and pulled it out for days. It was a clump that took up about a 10' radius above ground and there were runners extending fifteen feet or so out from that clump underground. \n\nAfter digging out all that we could see, I went through on my hands and knees and dug all the rhizomes out that I could find. It's going to be back because of those rhizomes. They break off during removal and they will grow more bamboo. The trick will be going out there and diligently removing it as it shows up. I have herbicide ready to go if it proves more than I can handle without it. We don't want to use it unless we have no other choice. \n\nDisposal of the bamboo is tricky too, after you pull it up. Vegetative matter is not accepted at our local dump and we're rural and do not have curbside pick up of yard waste. It's illegal (and super irresponsible) to dump it in the woods. We're lucky enough that we're allowed to take it to my husband's workplace where it will be burned along with a bunch of piles of brush they were clearing there. You want to be careful where you put it because it can and will grow under the right circumstances.\n\nI hear chickens love to eat the new bamboo shoots that pop up from the ground, but I don't want the stink of chickens or the work involved in keeping predators away.\n\nAny way, it's a big job. it's horrible, but you can do it. Just be aware it's going to be difficult. Thankfully ours was all growing about 2\" below the ground and we didn't have to dig too deep to get most of it. There were places where it was deeper because it will do that to get around obstacles like rocks and in our case a small pond I built for our dog. It had also shot runners beneath a deck and there were shoots coming up against the house and trying to go under the siding. Thankfully, the lack of light meant there were only maybe three of those to deal with. Also the soil was loose and covered in a layer of chips, so this stuff came up pretty easy in that section.\n\n## Comment ID fscx8pt with +1 score by [(crowfort, Reddit, 2020-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/gtgxun/help_with_wisteria_and_bamboo/fscx8pt/) (in reply to ID gtgxun):\nMy parent had bamboo growing up.

It sounds like you worked here in the early days of the creative team when it was separated as an R&amp;D effort, but you'll be happy to know that is no longer the case. Creative team members are integrated into account teams now and are extremely central to what we do! \n\n2. I am no longer involved in sales and I definitely agree with your critique. Account teams are now involved pre-sale for the clients they would be owning and it's going a lot smoother as a result!\n\n3. The \"group project\" call out is fair, though I think that was mostly due to our matrixed org structure. It made things difficult for us as we outgrew it. It was often unclear who the one person responsible for various things were. Too many approvals and too much consensus was required. We're now reorganizing into pods to fix this empower more leaders across the business. Definitely agree and understand this critique from the past though!\n\n4. The one thing I have to call out is that we are not and have never been \"a revolving door of clients\". We have very strong client retention and that has always been the case. I'm not sure if this happened on your clients specifically but I want to assure future team members and clients that this is not the case.\n\nThanks for what you put into Bamboo and again, I hope you found a better fit!",

It's a young company and management is always seeking input on ways to improve (see the detailed and sincere responses to the negative reviews for examples), but will also invest heavily in helping its people to grow in their role and intended career path. Even when debating whether to leave to pursue a dream career change, everyone was very supportive and positive. Bamboo really celebrates the accomplishments of all its employees (current and former) out of genuine care.\r\n\r\nFairly solid benefits in terms of health, dental, and vision, with stock options, flexible PTO (and you are actually encouraged to use it) and a generous but reasonable work from home policy. The work-life balance is also very good. \r\nMinor perks include a lounge stocked with snacks and a rotating schedule for people to bring their dogs into the office - as long as they're well behaved. \r\n\r\nThe team environment is great. Everyone is very friendly and casual and tries to make the day enjoyable, though will also be respectful and professional where needed. Management works hard to resolve even minor interpersonal conflicts from differences in work style so that everyone is content. There are many opportunities to connect with others inside and outside of work, though no major peer pressure as can sometimes occur at startups or in agency environments. Even during the pandemic, Bamboo did its best to attend to employee needs and set up virtual social events, from yoga and workouts to language lessons to involved happy hours.",

Today, many companies think they can check their diversity box by hiring women, and non-blacks, while not truly addressing the deeper cultural and institutional issues they have. Bamboo manages to model this standard with its white male-centered-bro-y culture.\r\n\r\nI didn't not realize my how much my experience at Bamboo had taken a toll on my life/stress, work-life-balance, and health until I left.\r\n\r\nWhen I joined Bamboo there was one Black man at the company. When I left there was still only one...\r\n\r\nMy team unfortunately was very unstable due to nepotism and the micro-aggressions that management got away with expressing toward their team members. This created an isolating environment for the mostly women and women of color that my boss acted out against.  \r\n\r\nWhat made it even more uncomfortable during my time at Bamboo was their performative acts towards transparency and how they quickly developed ambiguous performance evaluation processes to stifle employees from advancing and creating false expectations that they themselves did not live up to. \r\n\r\nThe company chooses the old school approach of vetting incoming candidates for \"cultural fit\" via macho whiskey meetings—making it easier to bring friends in. What resulted is the cliquey environment I found myself in—where like minds thrived, and diverse challenges to the \"tech world standard\" were seen as illegitimate or frowned upon. \r\n\r\nBamboo's HR and management teams lack the experience and training in diversity, inclusion and empathy to address deeply entrenched issues within the company. It's sad that many end up being singled out and unheard because of bias. I'd say run the other direction if you are looking for true growth and a company that values their people as much as their profit.",

              "response": "Hi there! Thank you for sharing feedback and for working at Bamboo. I'll try and address some of your review as best I can!\n\n1. The reason we don't negotiate salaries is because we want to make sure we have compensation methodology that is as equity and fair as possible. Negotiated salaries often introduce more gender or other pay disparities systematically (because white people and especially men tend to negotiate while underrepresented groups tend to not) and we want to avoid that. Here is a good overview on this POV if it's of interest: https://www.forbes.com/sites/financialfinesse/2018/04/11/a-powerful-way-to-close-the-pay-gap-dont-negotiate-salaries/?sh=7048f4e72209).\n\nIf it felt manipulative when I shared our policy with you, I probably should've done a better job explaining the \"why\" and I'll be sure we do that better going forward. Thank you again for sharing the feedback.\n\n2. On salaries, I'm not sure when you left Bamboo but we actually increased pay across the board for 2021 going forward so I agree with you on this! We could've paid better (we used to pay at 50th percentile) and now we do.\n\n3. I 100% agree that we more diversity across our teams. I started Bamboo as a 23 year old with two ex-coworkers, who were both white and from Michigan/Ohio. We should've prioritized diversity way earlier on, but we did a bad job at it in our first few years. This is a big focus for us going forward and making Bamboo as an inclusive a place as possible has been a big focus for us since 2020 (which is not soon enough!). We are also investing in more macro racial justice efforts as well (you can read more about that here: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6755176153276846080)\n\n4. I don't have enough details about your unique situation (\"team player\" doesn't clarify much, which is totally fine as I know you'd like to stay anonymous!), but we really try and train our coaches and leadership to empower their teams with autonomy and goal ownership at Bamboo. If you were or felt micromanaged in some way, I apologize for that. I encourage anyone who interviews with us to ask about what's it like working here day-to-day as they interview with folks across the team. I am certain this response would be very far from norm.\n\nThanks again for leaving feedback and for helping us build Bamboo. I really appreciate it!!",

To be direct, we've simply outgrown our current development planning infrastructure and promotion criteria. Our senior leadership is actively working to revamp both of these. Education and enablement our #1  and #2 priorities, respectively.\n\nI can't tell if you're still a full-time panda or not, but if you are, please know that our new leveling system will be rolling out in early Q3 (like next month!) and our current criteria will be wound down. Please be patient and I promise this will be fixed ASAP. Thanks again for your review and for everything you contribute to our teammates and clients!",

Today, many companies think they can check their diversity box by hiring women, and non-blacks, while not truly addressing the deeper cultural and institutional issues they have. Bamboo manages to model this standard with its white male-centered-bro-y culture.\r\n\r\nI didn't not realize my how much my experience at Bamboo had taken a toll on my life/stress, work-life-balance, and health until I left.\r\n\r\nWhen I joined Bamboo there was one Black man at the company. When I left there was still only one...\r\n\r\nMy team unfortunately was very unstable due to nepotism and the micro-aggressions that management got away with expressing toward their team members. This created an isolating environment for the mostly women and women of color that my boss acted out against.  \r\n\r\nWhat made it even more uncomfortable during my time at Bamboo was their performative acts towards transparency and how they quickly developed ambiguous performance evaluation processes to stifle employees from advancing and creating false expectations that they themselves did not live up to. \r\n\r\nThe company chooses the old school approach of vetting incoming candidates for \"cultural fit\" via macho whiskey meetings—making it easier to bring friends in. What resulted is the cliquey environment I found myself in—where like minds thrived, and diverse challenges to the \"tech world standard\" were seen as illegitimate or frowned upon. \r\n\r\nBamboo's HR and management teams lack the experience and training in diversity, inclusion and empathy to address deeply entrenched issues within the company. It's sad that many end up being singled out and unheard because of bias. I'd say run the other direction if you are looking for true growth and a company that values their people as much as their profit.",

Even when debating whether to leave to pursue a dream career change, everyone was very supportive and positive. Bamboo really celebrates the accomplishments of all its employees (current and former) out of genuine care.\r\n\r\nFairly solid benefits in terms of health, dental, and vision, with stock options, flexible PTO (and you are actually encouraged to use it) and a generous but reasonable work from home policy. The work-life balance is also very good. \r\nMinor perks include a lounge stocked with snacks and a rotating schedule for people to bring their dogs into the office - as long as they're well behaved. \r\n\r\nThe team environment is great. Everyone is very friendly and casual and tries to make the day enjoyable, though will also be respectful and professional where needed. Management works hard to resolve even minor interpersonal conflicts from differences in work style so that everyone is content. There are many opportunities to connect with others inside and outside of work, though no major peer pressure as can sometimes occur at startups or in agency environments. Even during the pandemic, Bamboo did its best to attend to employee needs and set up virtual social events, from yoga and workouts to language lessons to involved happy hours.",

      "# [How To Grow And Care For Bamboo by Steve Bender, www.facebook.com on 2016-11-11](https://www.southernliving.com/garden/perennials/how-to-grow-bamboo)\nBamboo (Bambusa vulgaris) is an evergreen perennial that grows in running and clumping formations. Running bamboo spreads faster than the clumping variety, making it highly invasive in environments where the growth goes unchecked. Native to Asia, this tropical and sub-tropical plant has several cultivar varieties.\n\nThe thick stems grow vertically in loose clumps but do not contain any thorns. Relatively strong, the common bamboo has yellow stems, or culms, with dark green foliage that emerges new in the spring. The continuous foliage and quick growth rate make common bamboo an excellent option as a privacy hedge. Plant in late spring or early fall.\n\nNote that raw bamboo culms and leaves contain toxins and people shouldn't eat them raw. However, there are specific varieties whose young shoots are edible and are considered non-toxic to pets and people.\n\nPlant Attributes\n\nBamboo Care\n\nPlant container-grown bamboo any time of year. Clumping bamboo often requires a barrier or garden stakes on one side to help the plant adjust to the desired shape as it grows in an enlarging circle. Use this variety away from fences or sidewalks and maintain its invasive spread by breaking off new shoots when the growth exceeds its space.\n\nLarge expanses of concrete or asphalt won't prevent the spread of running bamboo, but it isn't difficult to contain them—provided you understand how they grow. Rhizomes are shallow and spread sideways, not down. To prevent the horizontal spread of bamboo, block, cut, or surround the rhizomes with a trench.\n\nBamboo needs consistent watering and fertilizer while establishing and growing. Keep the soil moist but well-drained, and amend it with rich, fertile nutrients if required.\n\nLight\n\nCommon bamboo needs daily sun exposure to grow to its fullest potential. Provide plants with at least six hours of sunlight daily in moderately warm areas. In areas with harsher summer climates, the partial shade will provide bamboo with some relief from the afternoon sun. Bamboo grows well in environments with ample light and humidity.\n\nSoil\n\nBamboo thrives in moist, well-drained soil but will tolerate most soil types as long as it is not soggy or too dry. Use a slightly acid soil pH and balance the soil's nutrients with fertilizer if necessary. If growing bamboo in containers, use potting soil with organic compost, such as mushrooms.\n\nWater\n\nWater bamboo frequently and deeply for best growth and wet the soil around the plant to a few inches deep. Established plants tolerate considerable drought but look best with regular irrigation. If grown indoors, use a spray bottle to help amplify the humidity surrounding the bamboo.\n\nTemperature and Humidity\n\nNative to tropical and sub-tropical environments, bamboo grows best in humid areas with moist soil. Common bamboo grows naturally near river banks and open ground and tolerates various climate conditions. Depending on the variety, bamboo will defoliate during the dry season and grow new foliage during the rainy season or spring. Optimal temperatures range from 65°F to 90°F, but a cold-hardy bamboo variety can tolerate temperatures near 10°F.\n\nFertilizer\n\nFeed in-ground plants monthly, from March to October, with a high-nitrogen fertilizer or lawn fertilizer. Using a balanced fertilizer throughout the growing season helps plants to provide nutrients to the roots and keeps the bamboo healthy. Cut back on water and fertilizer to restrict the size and spread of an established bamboo.\n\nTypes of Bamboo\n\nThere is a diverse variety of bamboo to grow in gardens or containers. Depending on your space availability and growing environment, some species are better suited for different conditions. Here are only a few of the available selections:\n\n'Buddha's Belly' (Bambusa ventricosa): This plant grows well indoors, reaching about 5 to 8 feet tall in a container. It is adaptable to various conditions, and the culms grow in a unique, zigzagging formation.\n\n'Chilean Bamboo' (Chusquea culeou): Native to Latin America, this species has solid culms that grow up to 20 feet. This variety's solid stems make it an excellent option for a privacy screen or to use as a focal point in your garden.\n\n'Broad-leaf Bamboo' (Sasa Palmata): A tropical, running bamboo species with highly resilient growth, this plant tolerates shady environments.\n\n'Blue Bamboo' (Himalayacalamus hookerianus): This evergreen, clump-forming bamboo has slender and elegant culms, each containing a hint of red or purple coloring on top of its blue stems that mature to gold.\n\nPruning\n\nPrune bamboo any time during the year, but prevent accidentally removing emerging shoots during the growing season. Much of the pruning needed for bamboo plants is to maintain shape and appearance. Start by removing older, dead, or unsightly culms with a saw or sharp garden shears. Remove these unwanted culms to the ground, or cut above the node if you are pruning for appearance.\n\nDepending on the bamboo variety, running bamboo species must block the plant's surrounding area to avoid unwanted spread. A continuous polypropylene plastic sheet around the perimeter of the planting helps to block the space, but remember to keep a 2-inch lip above ground to stop runners. Never place plastic under roots, as they need excellent drainage. Continuously drying the soil, extending 10 to 20 feet beyond the planting bed, impedes runners.\n\nAnother effective pruning solution is to periodically insert a spade to its full length around the plant, severing the rhizomes and isolating unwanted parts from the main plant. Break off new shoots that rise from the isolated rhizomes, so they are unlikely to resprout. Surrounding the plant with an 18-inch deep and 1-foot wide trench can provide an opening to remove any emerging rhizomes. Fill the trench with loose mulch or sand, then use a spading fork several times a year to search the trench for roving rhizomes and easily sever.\n\nPropagating Bamboo\n\nThe best time to propagate bamboo from existing clumps is just before growth begins in the spring. Here is how to propagate bamboo by dividing culms or rhizome cuttings:\n\nDuring March or April (for hardy varieties) or May or early June (for tropical varieties), roots with at least three culms are divided using a sharp pruning shear or spade. Do not cut or spread the root ball, which will kill the canes.\n\nCut back the tops to balance the loss of roots and rhizomes. Don't worry if the foliage wilts because new growth will emerge from the missing culms.\n\nIf propagating from a clumping bamboo species, cut the rhizome with a garden spade from the root ball. Running bamboo will have a foot-long rhizome with roots and buds.\n\nAfter removing the section of bamboo from cuttings or the root ball, plant the new divisions in rich soil filled with organic material. Continue watering and maintain a moist, well-drained growing environment.\n\nHow to Grow Bamboo From Seed\n\nGrowing bamboo from seeds is challenging but possible in the right conditions. Here is how to grow bamboo from seeds:\n\nBamboo seeds need humidity to grow, so create a greenhouse if you do not own one. Start with a seed tray, bamboo seeds, pellets, and a container large enough to enclose the tray—creating a greenhouse atmosphere.\n\nFill each spot in the seed starting tray with a pellet and add water to cover it, filling the individual containers about halfway. Use clean water and let the pellets soak until expanding. Remove excess water.\n\nFill a container with clean water and submerge the bamboo seeds for up to 24 hours. Keep the seeds in a warm area.\n\nUse a pencil or fingers to create a hole in each pellet, which will plant one seed in each area. Make sure the seeds are completely covered. Place in a room with indirect sunlight and keep pellets moist. Continue care until sprouts reach the greenhouse container's top, then transplant them into a larger container to grow until it's time to move the plant outdoors.\n\nPotting and Repotting Bamboo\n\nWhen growing bamboo in a container, it might be necessary to repot the plant once it outgrows its current space. As an aggressive spreader, bamboo—especially running bamboo—can quickly overgrow if not maintained.\n\nStart with a sturdy, well-draining container with similar depth and width. Fill the container with rich potting soil, enough to cover the top of the root ball. Transplant the root ball in the new container, but do not pack the plant too deeply, as this can cause rot. Leave air pockets in the soil and water thoroughly. Depending on your preferences, continue repotting bamboo or gently divide the rhizomes to maintain shape and appearance.\n\nOverwintering\n\nAfter establishing growth, bamboo plants are relatively cold-hardy in USDA Zones 4-10. Planting bamboo in the spring is best to allow culms to emerge and take root before experiencing colder conditions. Adding mulch to the plant during its first winter season is recommended when planted outdoors. If using a container to grow bamboo, move the plant indoors before the first frost.\n\nCommon Pests & Plant Diseases\n\nScale, mealybugs, and aphids occasionally appear on bamboo but seldom do any harm. Spray with insecticidal soap or summer oil if these pests excrete honeydew in bothersome amounts. Mites can cause yellow streaking or disfigurement of leaves, which insecticidal soap can also control.\n\nRoot rot can occur in bamboo plants that do not have adequate circulation or wet growing environments. This soil-borne disease causes roots to appear darker or slimy. Use a sharp knife to remove damaged or mushy roots and prevent spreading by eliminating the culms above. Water the plant's base in the morning to prevent foliage from developing a fungus.\n\nCommon Problems With Bamboo\n\nBamboo plants are relatively free from problems and only require some maintenance. Your bamboo plant might need more water, soil nutrients, or sun exposure.\n\nCurling Leaves\n\nAdequate watering balance is one of the most challenging parts of caring for bamboo plants. Curling leaves signify underwatering. Without any other changes, changing the watering schedule is all that's needed to resolve this issue. Water plants once or twice a week at the plant's base. Different conditions, like container plants and harsh summer heat, might require watering more often.\n\nDrooping Leaves\n\nBamboo plants require a lot of nitrogen-rich fertilizer. Use organic compost at the beginning of the growing season in the spring and again in mid to late summer. Extra feeding can help revive the thinning plant when the foliage looks unhealthy. Brown leaves can signify too much fertilizer, so don't overfeed bamboo.\n\nLeaves Turning Brown\n\nToo much direct or harsh sunlight can cause bamboo plants' leaves to turn brown. Overwatering and underwatering can also cause an imbalance in soil nutrients, creating brown leaves. If possible, move bamboo to an area with indirect or filtered sunlight.",
