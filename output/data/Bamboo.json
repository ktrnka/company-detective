      "# [Dos and Donâts: LinkedIn Ads](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/post/dos-and-donts-linkedin-ads)\nLinkedIn has over 1 billion users worldwide with 65 million business decision-makers using the platform to connect with customers, employees, and other professionals. Like other social media platforms, LinkedIn has an advertising option. But is it effective?\n\nReports show that itâs 277% more effective for lead gen than Facebook or Twitter and offers three times the conversion rates of competitors.\n\nWith such good results, itâs possible that LinkedIn ads can benefit your company, but knowing a few best practices can help you get more out of every penny spent.\n\n1. Do target highly-specific groups\n\nLinkedIn allows for very narrow, niche targeting, so take advantage of this by drilling down for the audience you want to see your brand. It can take time to figure out what groups or keywords these audiences use, but when you find them, donât be afraid to personalize your messaging to speak to them directly. Choose an objective and align that objective accordingly with your target audience, leveraging LinkedIn's robust targeting capabilities.\n\nWhat kind of targeting can you look for? Over 39,000 skills are listed by users on LinkedIn, giving you some great insight into what words users prefer when referring to their careers. When you find your ideal customer, check out their skills. This can be a treasure trove of insight for future ad messaging. You can also go further by speaking with leads directly through their inbox.Â\n\nThe Bamboo team shares, âin Conversation and Sponsored Messaging Ads, leverage macros to substitute in personalized variables like a user's name, job position, or employer.â\n\nThis will help your message stand out from the other message requests they get and may help you land the deal, since theyâll see a message that targets them specifically.\n\n2. Donât advertise items that arenât relevant\n\nLinkedIn is a unique ad platform that caters to business professionals, job seekers, and those with B2B offerings. Itâs not ideal for certain brands, such as those in consumer health and lifestyle, unless you can tie in a business need. Lipstick may not be a good fit, but a new vitamin blend that supports the needs of the busy C-level professional may be. Just be sure it really fits the tone of other posts being shared on LinkedIn. Advertising ill-fitting brands is a waste of money and can damage your brand.\n\n3. Do start with conversation ads\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Conversation Ads, or those that land directly in a user's inbox, are hard to ignore.\n\nâConversation ads are a lesser known but very impactful ad format,â explains Bamboo's team of Growth Marketing Managers. âThey also have a cool decision tree mechanism that functions like a chatbot or choose-your-own-adventure.â\n\nFor busy marketing professionals, this can help you save time in replying to messages while still delivering highly-personalized messages to those who are most likely to buy your products or services.\n\n4. Â Donât be afraid of the price tag\n\nLinkedIn has a daily minimum ad buy of $10 and a campaign minimum of $100, but the CPM may be higher than what companies have paid on other platforms. Consider all the ways to put your money to good use.\n\nâSome advertisers' eyes may pop out looking at CPM costs. LinkedIn is a more expensive platform, but the value lies in the targeting. While the impressions may be costly to deliver, keep a close eye on cost-per-conversion and conversion rate to ensure your campaigns perform up to benchmark.â\n\nIt's recommended to take a little extra time to figure out Lead Form Opens to Impressions to get a better idea of how your Conversation Ads are doing instead of the click-through rate (CTR) or the open rates provided by the LinkedIn reporting platform. This is especially important for getting native lead forms out through the messaging option.\n\nLinkedIn may not be the first place you think of spending your ad dollars, but this platform already attracts professionals willing to spend a significant amount of money for LinkedIn Premium Business, Sales Navigator Core, or Recruiter Lite features. Currently, 39% of users pay for LinkedIn Premium, and 37% of millionaires are LinkedIn members.",
      "# [How Turo decreased Host CPA 73% with Bamboo](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/turo)\nTo measure the effectiveness of mobile app campaigns, they also needed to test operating systems (iOS/Android) to determine where paid social investment should be allocated.Â\n\nBamboo built multiple mobile app install ad variations to test which creative assets and formats worked best; carousel, static image (with and without copy overlay), or video format. The team tested these formats simultaneously with audience targeting including car owners with a single or multi-car household, home-sharers, online car marketplaces, and a lookalike audience built from users who have already listed their cars on Turo.Â\n\nOn Instagram, the team discovered quickly that static image ads outperformed carousel and video format ads, while on Facebookâs Mobile News Feed, carousel ad format outperformed static and video formats in terms of driving owners to complete listing their vehicle on Turoâs app.",
      "# [How The Black Tux decreased customer acquisition costs 37% with Bamboo](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/theblacktux)\nThe strategy centered around leveraging Facebook's unique relationship targeting abilities to acquire high-value customers, while also developing and testing immersive ad formats suited for storytelling and product showcasing.\n\nâFacebookâs relationship status audiences allow us to target high-value potential customers and nurture them over the course of their engagement until theyâre ready to think about the groom and groomsmen attire. Our goal is that, by that time, we will have convinced them to choose us.â - Matt Gierl, VP of Growth & Marketing at The Black Tux\n\nThe team first combined multiple audience attributes and filters. Targeting consumers ages 18 to 65 with an âEngagedâ relationship status, Bamboo split out the Black Tux campaigns between men and women in order to serve the most relevant creative to each.\n\nBamboo leveraged Lookalike Audiences of current customers and interested customers, which doubled the addressable audience size and helped lower acquisition costs. Bamboo also used Custom Audiences to retarget people who had previously engaged with the companyâs website.\n\nBamboo diversified creative testing by using ad formats including video ads, Instagram Stories, collections, and carousels. Through testing and optimizing these formats, the team found that immersive formats like collection and carousel ads led to the most conversions, beating static image ads by up to 238%.",
      "# [How AllTrails improved app conversion rate 40% with Bamboo](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/alltrails)\nCOVID-19 changed human behavior. It's as simple as that. People opting for outdoors instead of indoors, shopping at home instead of in-person â all while finding new ways to connect. Throughout the dynamic year, Bamboo had to learn how to adjust its campaign strategy to position AllTrails as the go-to product to stay healthy, mentally and physically.\n\nBamboo aimed to harness the momentum of interest within the client's vertical by attracting loyal, long-term customers in an increasingly competitive space, with the goal of improving app retention.\n\nBamboo strategized to attract users likely to explore new health alternatives during a global pandemic using a localized and seasonal approach. This was supported by a multifaceted campaign strategy:\n\n- Restructured geo targeting tiers across paid social and realigned on KPIs per tier\n\n- Accelerated investment ahead of highly seasonal milestones\n\n- Leveraged tCPA app campaigns with Google\n\nBamboo optimized toward a mid-funnel event that preceded the main KPI in the user funnel. This gave the team confidence that the algorithm would receive ample conversion volume to learn quickly. Bamboo also monitored user cohorts to understand and react to changes in user behavior after the initial acquisition.\n\nBy adopting Bamboo's growth strategy, AllTrails was able to take advantage of the growing demand in their industry and position themselves as the market leader in outdoor trail navigation apps. Bamboo's strategy allowed a new and diverse set of users to discover a healthy way to recreate during a global pandemic. The approach also allowed for:\n\nRapidly expanded total market coverage with the launch of new Google App campaigns (6x YoY increase in investment)\n\nImprovement in YoY growth by 40% with in-app conversion ratesÂ\n\nImprovement in average monthly LTV by 52%",
      "# [How Rebag increased AOV by 50% with Bamboo](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/rebag)\nRebagâs unique business required an equally one-of-a-kind advertising strategy; maintaining the Rebag brand while developing new creative was essential. The Rebag team wanted to maintain a more upscale, minimalist look. Bamboo produced ads that did just that.Â\n\nLanding on an initial style that Rebag loved, the Bamboo team worked with Rebagâs in-house design team to brainstorm and build variations of copy, borders, video, and carousels â until top-performers were discovered. \"The Rebag brand is extremely important to us, so images that conveyed a luxurious product were a must-have. Using the creative approach Bamboo came up with, we can deliver ads that hit Rebagâs creative and business goals.\" - Elizabeth Layne, Chief Marketing Officer at Rebag\n\nWe worked closely with Rebagâs team to begin testing ideas and iterations. Due to Rebagâs designer bags coming in at a high price point, it can be hard to find a consistent sweet spot when advertising. As a way to keep sales steady, Bamboo included a healthy mix of dynamic and non-dynamic product ads for prospecting. This allowed the team to capture favorable ROAS for non-dynamic ads, but build volume and consistency with dynamic ads. Combining the performance of all prospecting ads, Bamboo helped Rebag start off strong with a ROAS that improved over time.",
      "# [How Webflow 10x'd lead volume with Bamboo](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/webflow)\nThe benefits afforded to an enterprise lead gen program by LinkedIn Advertising are immediately apparent: through its unique targeting options, you can reach highly-specific groups with tailored messaging on a platform where people are engaging in a business mindset.\n\nThe challenge on LinkedIn is to run campaigns cost-efficiently. Thereâs no getting around it â impressions and clicks are pricey on LinkedIn. Committing to gradual improvement overtime and aggressively searching for opportunities to optimize are key to succeeding on this platform. The average cost-per-click for LinkedIn ads is around $5.26, while Facebookâs average CPC is $0.97. Cost of course varies case-by-case, but the same principle generally applies between platforms.\n\nIn order to generate meaningful performance improvements, Bamboo needed to launch countless tests, take big swings, learn from losses and iterate upon wins. The approach came down to shifting away from a full-funnel approach to consolidate into KPI driving campaigns only, test and refine core audiences, lean into lead magnet assets and gated content, and leverage unique ad formats such as Conversation Ads.\n\nBamboo observed that when upper-funnel campaign spend is incorporated into overall CPA, the blended rate was not efficient enough to achieve goals. In response, Bamboo collapsed the funnel into two stages: gated content at the top and demo offers at the bottom.\n\nThe team was able to evolve the targeting approach by casting a wide net to start, and then testing out different segments within that pool. When a winning segment was identified, Bamboo would get even more specific with things like job function, job titles, and company size.\n\nOn average, ads promoting Webflowâs blog content had 25% higher CTR than the product demo campaigns. Bamboo leveraged this insight to find a happy medium between the two approaches â keeping audiences engaged with content offerings, with the caveat that the asset is unlocked through submission of a contact form.\n\nThe team found early success with native lead gen forms and conversation ads. Conversation ads were leveraged for their benefit of keeping the experience on-platform and utilizing their decision tree mechanism that functions like a chatbot or choose-your-own-adventure game. The end result is a highly targeted, highly personalized message delivered directly to a userâs inbox.",
      "# [Lemonaid Health: Seed Stage to $400M Exit with Bamboo](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/case-studies/lemonaidhealth)\nIn the rapidly evolving telehealth industry, Lemonaid Health faced a multifaceted challenge that hindered its growth and market penetration. They offered an extensive range of telehealth services, each with unique customer acquisition costs and lifetime values, resulting in a complex and inefficient paid media strategy. This abundance of SKUs led to varying customer acquisition costs that made it difficult for Lemonaid Health to allocate its media budget effectively. Consequently, they heavily over-indexed toward paid search. This over-reliance on paid search not only limited the company's reach but also stunted its ability to explore and capitalize on other channels that could offer better ROI.\n\nLemonaid Health came to Bamboo to optimize their media spend and align the spend with their overall goal of maximizing customer lifetime value. Before the partnership, Lemonaid struggled to differentiate between what drove long-term customer loyalty versus what attracted more transactional, one-time purchases.\n\nBamboo first prioritized paid social by optimizing Facebook strategies with focused testing on evergreen content and pricing messages to engage new patients. They quickly diversified assets using Bambooâs Creative Services, launching videos including in-house and UGC testimonials that featured medical industry professionals to increase trust and credibility.\n\nWithin 2 months, Bamboo expanded into paid search, diversifying the paid search strategy to widen reach. They tested non-brand keywords and optimized creatives and landing pages to boost engagement and conversions. Bamboo broadened Lemonaid's presence with Google Shopping and Display and used Universal App Campaigns to acquire both new and churned patients\n\nBamboo utilized paid search, paid social, and Lemonaidâs first-party analytics to identify key drivers of both short-term and long-term revenue across Lemonaidâs telehealth SKUs. These insights refined Lemonaid Health's strategy and allowed them to drive fast and sustainable growth.",

Both teams looked beyond channel management to paid program strategy and landing page experience to make sure potential enrollees had a holistic &Â compelling view of the brand from start to finish. Â\n\nSocial vs SearchÂ\n\nWith view-through conversions and Appleâs privacy laws, one of the larger challenges was having clear visibility into social performance on a business level. To understand better how the channels interact with each other and the business, Bamboo tested the media mix between search and social and the impact on brand volume. Additionally, testingÂ a different channel split and noting impact on overall performance was critical as Bamboo landed on a 70/30 Social/Search split.\n\nThis will vary for different advertisers based on the industry, and awareness of the brand in the market. With Furkin being a new brand, it aligned with the objective of also increasing overall awareness of the brand.\n\nIncremental geo expansion driven by higher confidence in strategy\n\nBamboo found success within platforms by targeting most populous cities and regions within Canada. As campaign scaled, expanding into new territories was deliberate and intentional. Bamboo expanded into specific zip codes and provinces before extending our media reach to a country wide target. At this time, there was high confidence in the strategy since winning creatives, messaging and overall media strategy had been identified.\n\nSocial testingÂ\n\nWithin Social, Bamboo leaned heavily into testing various aspects of our strategy. With lower budgets, Bamboo established testing strategies that ranged from A/B tests, and informal testing with benchmarks and check in cadences to make quick decisions based on directional data (platform + business level).\n\nSearch\n\nSince Google noted higher conversion volume, we set up campaigns optimizing for Enrollments. However, since we were limited by budgets, the campaigns were set at Maximize conversions. In Q3, Search scaled 64% driving 110% more enrollments Q/Q at a 22% efficient CPE. We were able to unlock this using a mix of strategies laid out below.\n\nBrand vs Non Brand\n\nOn search, the objective was to scale within the pet insurance categoryÂ with our Non Brand effort since we wanted to lean into the most incremental tactic while capturing all brand demand that social was generating. Over the quarter, Bamboo successfully increased Non Brand split from 59% -> 70% which drove 128% more enrollments at a 14% more efficient CPE.\n\nScaling Non Brand with Broad + Phrase & Exact + DSAÂ\n\nUnlocking Non Brand in an extremely competitive market was critical for Bamboo since it would prove to be the most incremental. Bamboo wasable to do this leaning into a multi pronged approach leaning into DSA to capture and mine new queries while testing Broad Match at lower budgets and using phrase & exact campaigns to maintain control on performance. As a result, Non Brand scaled 94%.Â Â\n\nWhile the Bamboo team worked on media strategies, the Furkin team worked quickly internally to facilitate a better user experience across the media touch points and at a product level. They were able to do this successfully by:",

The team proposed including In-Feed Discovery Video, Consideration, and Video Actions in order to conquer shared goals of increasing overall enrollments. Budget was allocated between the following initiatives to ensure the test was set up for success.Â\n\nYouTube In-Feed Discovery Video campaigns were established to increase brand awareness and views for Trupanionâs Pup Talk Series. The goal was to establish Trupanion as a thought leader within the industry and gain higher reach and engagement value from less expensive ad placements, pushing users into the various retargeting audiences and funnels currently in place.\n\nConsideration campaigns were set up on YouTube to test and garner new interest in prospective customers by introducing the Trupanion brand for further research into the product. Bamboo also wanted to interject the Trupanion brand into the video pet space to sway potential customers away from competitors with value props such as a free quote, and survey users and viewers on brand recall and their preference to pick Trupanion over other competitors.\n\nLastly, the team tested YouTube Video Action campaigns to capture high-value customers ready to make enrollment or quote in the pet medical insurance space.

When short-form video campaigns do well, they are regularly the top performing ad type in an account.Â\n\nWith over 70 billion in daily views, YouTube Shorts is growing increasingly popular for advertisers looking to diversify their media mix.Â\n\nLetâs dive into some best practices for building a strong YouTube Shorts creative strategy.Â Â\n\n1. Include your brand logo very early on, and then again at the end of the video, so that viewers understand immediately who created the content.\n\n2. Use looping to give your viewers the satisfaction of watching over and over again. Start filming your videos with the final shot to achieve this effect. (Donât forget the audio!)\n\n3. Add a song or other audio clip to your Shorts. Make sure you use songs and sounds that are available for commercial use. Most of the music and sounds found in YouTubeâs library are free, but only for personal, non-commercial use unless you have the appropriate licenses.\n\n4. YouTube Shorts videos only allow up to 60 seconds, so ensure youâre making the most of the limited time to get your message across succinctly. Shorts are meant to be short. You donât always have to use the full duration if you can get the message across sooner.\n\n5. If youâre repurposing content from another platform, ensure your content is in the correct ratio for YouTube Shorts and that the clip is tailored specifically to this platform.\n\n6. Add enticing thumbnails to intrigue your audience and grab attention from the first glance. Make it eye-catching by featuring bright colors, interesting fonts, and relevant imagery that will stop people in their tracks.\n\n7. Last but not least: To produce great ads for every ad platform and asset type, we recommend finding multiple agency partners who can deliver best-in-class work per category.

      "# [LTV and Profitability on Meta](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/post/efficient-growth-tips-ltv-and-profitability-on-meta)\nFacebook and Instagram ads certainly have the potential to create a higher lifetime value of your customers, but it doesnât make sense to approach the advertising platform without some background on whatâs working.\n\nIf youâve been advertising for a while, and the results have been lackluster, consider these best practices and tips to improve how efficiently you're growing on Meta.\n\nWhat is a customer lifetime value (CLTV)?\n\nCustomer lifetime value (CLTV) is measured as the net profit you think you can get from a single customer over a lifetime. It includes how often they buy within a cycle, how much they spend each time they make a purchase, and how long they remain a customer. If even one of these factors moves in the right direction, your LTV can skyrocket, but no one factor is more important than the others.\n\nWith Facebook and Instagram (Meta), specifically, you may find a formula that works best for your business, just for these platforms. Orienting towards efforts for LTVÂ = orienting towards profitability. Consider how you want to measure LTV before you begin tinkering with your ad campaigns.Â\n\nDisappointed in your ad results? Try these tactics below for improved profitability and for more LTVÂ use case examples and to learn how adopting customer lifetime value strategies leads to profitable growth, we recommend exploring Meta's recently released LTV whitepaper.\n\n1. Help your customer get to know you better\n\nCustomers will only get the full value of your product (and continue using it) if they understand what they are buying. Ideas for boosting this opportunity include creating ads that also serve as educational content for your customer after they buy.\n\nMeta shared in their LTVÂ whitepaper, \"If a business can identify the most profitable customers early in the relationship, it can maximize the gains from the most loyal customers while minimizing the losses from trying to persuade customers who have a low chance of becoming profitable in the long run.\"\n\nWhen a customer knows more about how something works, they are more likely to use it correctly and appreciate the value it brings to their lives. By advertising in a way that helps customers \"get\" you and your brand, you can boost overall LTV for that product line.Â â\n\n2. Use value-based Lookalike Audiences\n\nIf youâre not already taking advantage of first-party data (1P), you may be missing out. This information is ideal for creating Lookalike Audiences of those who may not be familiar with your brand but match the demographics of those who already know and live it.\n\nLook-alike Audiences are preferred over generic categories based on age, location, and interest, which require you to guess the common denominator among avid buyers.Â Meta also shared that businesses using broad targeting strategies can also optimize towards higher value consumers by excluding low-value Lookalike Audiences without complicating the ad account structure.\n\nHowever, ensure you're up to date on Meta's best practices for using value-based Lookalike Audiences and ways you should avoid when calculating customer LTV.\n\n3. Condense advertised product offerings to those that create high LTV\n\nOne common mistake is to advertise only your cheapest product or service with the thought that it creates a lower barrier to those purchasing for the first time. While it can drive an initial sale, it doesnât guarantee future sales, which can contribute to a lower LTV.Â\n\nInstead of promoting low-cost products through low-priced bids, consider boosting your premium products, which may attract those with higher user intent to spend more over their lifetime. While the customer acquisition cost (CAC) may initially be higher, the LTV to CAC ratio should improve; the customers you attract may be more in line with what you need to create a loyal fanbase of eager buyers for your more expensive products.Â\n\n(Note: Quality data is needed to create these opportunities, so be sure you are the tools available to collect user data.)Â\n\n4. Consider adjusting to a predicted LTV bid\n\nAnother useful tactic is to use a dynamically or manually set revenue based on the predicted LTV (pLTV) as the value for a purchase conversion event. This bid should be based on your target LTV:CAC ratio. Youâll be able to bid more aggressively toward users with a specific propensity to be qualified or behave like a high-value customer. It also feeds the platform algorithm with more data, which is especially relevant when a product or service's LTV grows significantly past the first 30 days.\n\nHow do you do this from the Meta ad platform? Start by adjusting the product value on a new event, then create a purchase and a âpLTV purchaseâ to test it out. You may have to adjust the product value manually via a tagging tool like Google Tag Manager and a look-up table. (These tables use the product name as a key for the input variable and use the output value as the \"purchase\" value.) Then, you simply add this value to a duplicated Facebook or Google tag and begin using them for reporting or even testing them as an optimization event.Â\n\nIn their LTVÂ whitepaper, Meta also highlighted that marketers using pLTVÂ in Ads Manager must understand the limitations of attribution. \"All reporting within Ads Manager is subject to attribution logic and will offer a filtered view of performance. Therefore, marketers should use pLTVÂ as a success metric in Conversion Lift when making strategic decisions.\"\n\nBottom line: Because of certain uncontrollable factors, such as geography, subscription length, or product type, LTV can vary significantly. You may opt to dynamically change your output value based on these conditions. These factors must be denoted in your data layer, so you can then build a function that will reference these variables and return a dynamic value that's used in place of the transaction amount.",

      "# [TikTok Ads That Convert: Secrets from Bambooâs Designers](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/post/tiktok-ads-that-convert-efficient-growth-secrets-from-bamboo-designers)\nWith over 1 billion monthly active users, itâs become increasingly important for brands to make a presence on the fastest-growing social network, TikTok. The numbers truly speak for themselves:Â\n\n3 Billion Installations\n\nTikTok has been installed on devices over 3 billion times worldwide (source)\n\n167 Million TikTok Videos Watched in an Internet MinuteÂ\n\nIn an \"internet minute\", people consume hundreds of thousands of hours of content and send, scroll, and upload millions of messages, emails, and texts (source)\n\nTikTok Users Spend > 850 Minutes per Month on the App\n\nUsage has grown tremendously since first recorded in October 2019 at an average of 442.9 minutes per month (source)\n\nThese stats make TikTok an exciting advertising channel for marketers because of its scalability. Compared to other channels in your media mix, TikTok is the least saturated with advertisers, making it a platform where you can find relatively cheaper costs.Â\n\nIf youâve been thinking about adding TikTok into your mix, donât wait any longer.Â\n\nâ\n\nExcited about giving TikTok a shot but donât know where to start with creative? Below are the top 5 TikTok ad best practices weâre making sure to utilize for our clients to push towards efficient growth. Regardless of your industry,Â we hope you'll find some inspiration for your own creative strategy.Â\n\nâ\n\n1) Design a TikTok, not an adÂ\n\nTikTok openly challenges brands to embrace the creativity, positivity, and realness of the platform when designing ad creative. In order to meaningfully connect with the TikTok community, an ad must seamlessly fit into the For You feed by incorporating the latest TikTok trends that fit the unique style and tone of the platform.Â\n\nThe goal here is for viewers to stumble on your ad and get reeled by thinking itâs content thatâs native to the platform!\n\nâ\n\nâ2) Use Transition Filters for a Native Feel\n\nIn the world of TikTok, advertisers have just 3 seconds to hook users before theyâre swiping onto somebody else's video. Quick transition filters are the way to keep the audience watching. In contrast to other social platforms, ad lengths of 9-12 seconds are best for view-throughs, and these transitional cuts help get your full message across in the shortest amount of time. On top of turning your ads into an energetic and animated viewer experience, using these filters can help your brand stay on-trend by making your ad look more native to the platform.Â\n\nKeep in mind, TikTok ads donât repeat as native videos do, so if you want that loop effect you know and love, youâll have to manually create it before uploading your video to the platform.\n\nâ\n\n3) Maximize your message with Typography\n\nWith an aspect ratio of just 9:16, itâs crucial to use every bit of creative space intentionally.Â Your typography design can take many shapes and forms from closed captions to text overlays. Whatever your message, the key is to make your text look as though it was added inside the TikTok platform, a capability that organic creators have.Â\n\nAt Bamboo, we find this to be one of the most simple and effective ways to make your ads look in line with organic content when scrolling on the FYP.\n\nâ\n\n4) Use Display Cards for Memorable messaging\n\nIn the small length of time your ad runs, you want to make sure your brand is memorable. TikTok is making this easier for advertisers with every new feature thatâs rolled out. Display cards are one of their newest interactive creative add-ons. You can think of display cards as an overlay, they usually appear within 2-3 seconds of the ad starting. This feature is a fantastic way to incorporate more branding, messaging or star reviews into your creative.Â\n\nPro tip: Use display cards for quick iterations on video concepts you already have by overlaying a new mini card at the beginning to refresh them.\n\nâ\n\n5) Add Audio to Grab Attention\n\nLast but certainly not least, the audio you choose for your ad will be one of the first elements to grab a viewerâs attention. Finding the right audio can be tricky, especially when it comes to musicâchances are, the trendy song youâd like to use will get your ad taken down because you donât have the appropriate rights to use it. To combat this, TikTok rolled out The TikTok Commercial Music Library with a pool of over 150,000 pre-cleared, royalty tracks sourced from top-tier music houses. Here at Bamboo, we also like to browse tracks from emerging artists through Artist.Io.\n\nOf course, you canât forget about TikTokâs text-to-speech feature for your ads. Creators use it to narrate their videos, as an accessibility tool, and to make enjoyable content overall.\n\nCrunched for time but want your ads to be successful on TikTok? You donât have to reinvent the wheel. Take your top-performing Facebook assets and implement as many of the above best practices as you can.\n\nâ\n\nWe look forward to sharing the success our clients have seen using these tips and tricks!Â",
      "# [Shopify LTV Benchmarks for 2023: How does your brand stack up?](https://www.growwithbamboo.com/post/shopify-ltv-benchmarks-for-2023-how-does-your-brand-stack-up)\n2023 will be here before we know it, so Varos and Bamboo have partnered up to share the latest Shopify Lifetime Value (LTV) benchmarks and analysis across beauty, fashion, food & beverage, and home & garden verticals. We hope it helps with 2023 planning.\n\nâTo see how granular KPIs stack up against other companies just like yours, try Varos today. Takes just 2 minutes.\n\nIf you want support to drive more profitable growth in 2023, reach out to the team at Bamboo.Â\n\nHere are the benchmarks and analysis:\n\nTop beauty brands earned an extra $40 per customer by Month 12. They achieve this by earning more revenue per customer in Month 1 and then continuing to expand that revenue per customer until LTVs flatten out around Month 7. Beauty appears to have lower retention rates after Month 7 than some other verticals we analyzed, so we recommend that beauty brands ensure they are profitable on customers well before that point. For Bambooâs top beauty clients, we generally aim to be profitable on customer acquisition in Month 1.\n\nTop fashion brands also out-earned their peers in Month 1 and continued doing so through Month 6. The end result is an extra $59 per customer by Month 12 for top performers. LTV curves flattened out for Fashion brands around Month 5, so we recommend ensuring profitability on new customer acquisition before that. For Bambooâs top fashion clients, we like to see profitability on customer acquisition costs by Month 2 (preferably month 1).Â\n\nIn Food and Beverage, monetization after Month 1 is clearly what separates the best from the rest. Top F&B brands continue stacking lifetime value each month while the Median F&B brand earns less early on and stops monetizing customers almost entirely by Month 6. Top F&B brands are earning $40 more per customer in Year 1 and appear to keep on earning revenue from customers after that point. If youâre an F&B brand who has strong repeat rates, you should be okay with longer customer acquisition payback periods â possibly up to 6 months or more.\n\nIn terms of Lifetime Value, top Home and Garden brands outperform every other vertical.Â\n\nH&G also has the biggest gap between âthe bestâ and âthe restâ. Top H&G brands earn almost triple the revenue per customer in Month 1 and end up earning a whopping $122 more per customer by the end of Year 1. This gap makes sense in a vertical that includes both furniture and small H&G items, but itâs clear that the market potential for any H&G brand is large for brands that can monetize well upfront and then upsell customers successfully over time.\n\nWhen we look at the overall roll up, itâs clear that top Shopify brands monetize their customers better early and they monetize their better in later months too. The best Shopify brands earn an extra $56 per customer in Year 1 by outperforming their peers in both acquisition and retention.\n\nIn our CAC and ROAS obsessed industry, many teams ignore 50% or more of the value they capture when they successfully acquire a customer. Top Shopify brands earn more value at every stage of the customer journey, not just in the customerâs first month. With that, itâs critical to understand how your full customer journey stacks up to your peers!Â\n\nTo see how granular KPIs stack up against other companies just like yours, try Varos today. Takes just 2 minutes.\n\nIf you want support to drive more profitable growth in 2023, reach out to the team at Bamboo.Â",

With so many transactions to analyze, Excel quickly hits row limits, making it impossible to truly understand cohort behavior and project future customer value without more robust tooling.\n\nThat's why we built I Heart Cohorts, a free tool that unlocks cohorts and lifetime value insights in just a few clicks. The app allows anyone to analyze cohorts of any size, handling even the largest transaction volumes with ease. PS - we donât track or store any transaction data you analyze with the tool. All data processing happens locally in your browser. Files selected will not be sent to or shared with our servers or any third party service.\n\nHereâs how to use the app:\n\n1. Upload your transaction file(s) that include a transaction value, transaction date, and user ID and press \"analyze\".\n\n2. The app gives you a perfect cohorted revenue report and lifetime value reports for free.\n\n3. You can export the finished cohorted revenue report to CSV if you want to do further analysis in Excel afterward.\n\nWe hope you enjoy it!

There is a new electro pen with a copper pen tip that has just been released. It has potential with Bamboo Paper but could use a bit of fine tuning.

I’ve used multiple apps for note taking, even ones that charge an arm and a leg just to be presented with some laggy or glitchy technology. But Bamboo has taken note of what true to life note taking should be like and reinvented it for a tablet. \n\nWhenever I’m taking notes with my Apple Pencil it doesn’t feel like I’m writing on a tablet, that’s how smooth it is! \n\nBut although I have a list of great things to say about it, I still have some wants from it to. This app would be my to go to app for all note taking if...\n\nA few updates came around. \n\nMy main pet peeve is the fact that notes can’t be taken on landscape. Whenever I start my notes on portrait I’m forced to keep taking them on portrait. It’d be awesome if you would incorporate the ability for the paper to rotate with the orientation desired. \n\nAlong with this, the app still glitches when zooming in and out during note taking or designing. I always get the pop up that if I turn off multitasking it’ll make it better but it actually makes it worse. So as a result, this causes unintentional writing or marks on paper. \n\nNot as major, but recording during note taking process or recording option when a note taking notebook is chosen would add a lot of value to the app.\n\nLastly, there should be more personalization options for the notebooks. I understand there are a variety of notebooks we can choose from that come with their own paper layout and cover but having the ability to interchange the covers would move this app to my #1 note taking app, actually my sole note taking app.\n\nI hope that some of these thoughts are already being worked on because I honestly can’t find a better app that makes note taking fun and stress free.",

Precision is questionable in my experiences because I use apple pen. Compared to so many other sketching and drawing apps, bamboo paper falls short. Hand writing and line quality feels unstable. Perhaps there is a better support for Wacom pens as there is a specific connection tool just for the Wacom products. But this was something I was willing to overlook since the description states there is better quality experience through Wacom products.\n\nMy main qualm is with the fact that there is no way to transfer purchases from iOS to windows 10. On the windows app, there is no way to log into inkspace. What is the point of Wacom account if there’s no way to sign into it on the application so that you can transfer purchases and data? If you do not intend to fix this issue, please add a way for customers to be reimbursed. On top of this, when I contacted customer support, I was told there was no cross platform synchronization. If I purchased something on iOS, it stays on iOS, on iPad.\n\nOn their website, they claim the Wacom account is a wonderful way to connect apps and maintain registered products. The Wacom website provides a marketplace for apps that is, quite frankly, confusing and unusable. They display free apps that you cannot download or are missing download links. It is riddled with many missing pages or they just refuse to load. Why display bamboo paper on the marketplace if it’s not an app that can be purchased through the marketplace? Their inadequacy does not just stop there, all their services provided by their website is riddled with issues such as missing links and confusing product registration process. \n\nI do believe Wacom has great products to offer, but their services fall short in ways that add to frustration and inconvenience rather than facilitate work flow.",

I have many archived notebooks, and have come to depend heavily on this app in my work. Since I switched to the iPad Pro one and a half years ago, Bamboo Paper has been failing miserably. \nAt first there was no compatibility for iPencil - ridiculous. The resolution was horrible. They fixed those items after a few months, but unfortunately the wrist sensitivity was never improved; I am constantly erasing stray marks on the page. \nFor the past 8 months or so, I have been getting a notification to update the app. Repeatedly. It does not update. Since they created Inkspace, my notebooks do not sync in the cloud. I called support a couple of times, useless. \nThey provided an \"update\" in March that did nothing. My app did not update, as far as I know. \nNow I am furious - for the past month or two (maybe since the \"update\") my notebooks have been completely screwed up. I will open the app and have two notebooks for separate projects suddenly have the same name. The pages are still there, but since they have the same name I have no idea which book is which. I create a new notebook, and next time I open the app it copies the name AND PAGES of an existing notebook. I delete the pages in one notebook, and it wound up deleting the pages in the original notebook too. So now I can't create a new notebook, I have three notebooks with the same name, and two contain exactly zero pages - while the third has pages from a different notebook. \nUnbelievable. I'm done with Bamboo Paper, and I'm done with Wacom. Losing work history is ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. Get your act together - it's a real shame. This was a great app; not sure why they couldn't embrace Pro and iPencil right off the bat. \nBuh-bye.",

That said, Apple does offer the beta builds for upcoming OS releases and developers should test when a major update is on the horizon. This user impacting issue is solely Wacom's fault and hopefully they learn from it. Also I REALLY wish palm rejection was implemented in the app. It is extremely awkward taking notes without resting your hand down. \n\n*** ORIGINAL REVIEW***\n\nThis is a great app for taking notes in class and or sketching.

It also crashes regularly on the attempts to change the color of the stroke while writing.\n- the line goes out of sync with the tooltip of the stylus towards the right edge of the screen. The line appears too far to the left from the tip of the pen. This is not happening on the left side or in the middle of the screen. This changes when the orientation of the screen is changed, so it seems to be a software and not a hardware issue.\n- the mark on the paper appears when the pen is lifted, rather then when it touches the screen.

      "# works Great for me - IPad Air 2, 5 stars [(darkdragon9967, Apple App Store, 2021-06-27)](https://apple/7514277034)\nUsing the iPad Air 2 with the Adonit Dash 3 pen and this app in combination is excellent. Good-writing,  palm rejection works great 99% of the time. Otherwise you can buy a cheap handwriting glove if you wish. It works by Bluetooth. Make sure you turn the pen on along with the tablet's Bluetooth. The Adonit Dash3 in combination with Bamboo paper is the best most consistent writing experience on the iPad Air 2 which doesn't support any of the Apple Pencils BTW. There is a new electro pen with a copper pen tip that has just been released. It has potential with Bamboo Paper but could use a bit of fine tuning. That pen is not Bluetooth but palm rejection is a bit more hot or miss.. Bamboo paper is great for writing and journaling which is what I mainly use it for. On the iPad Air 2, I would recommend the Adonit Dash 3 pen to use Bamboo Paper.",

This app just feels nice right from the getgo. I have like 12 physical journals each with a different theme for taking notes. I’m really just trying to consolidate them in one space. And then from there I’m just looking to write. I don’t need any of that high powered whatever. The interface is lovely. I haven’t encountered any of the glitching other people have mentioned. I’ve also only had this a day, but it seems reliable. I tested the backups and they worked. Backups are limited to the Bamboo ecosystem which is technically every platform but not super nice.

This is frustrating for me because I love using bamboo paper but I have to resort to using a sub par app like zoom notes lite which has the features I want ie pdf annotation support and a ruler kit for my math classes. If your using strict blank notes bamboo paper is the best app you will find. I have tested hundreds of apps and this does its job amazingly. I just wish it could support my needs so I can use its great handwriting imitation and feel more often. Also zoom notes lite isn’t bad but compared to bamboo paper everything is subpar.",

I cannot express how many times this is fumbled up my drawing experience.. please take this out or let me turn it off. \n\nTwo: zooming on the page is the least responsive zoom experience of any drawing app I’ve used. Half the time it doesn’t work and ends up putting a line of ink through my work where I was using my fingers to zoom. \n\nThree: please give the eraser fixed size options, the way it changes size based on scrub speed leaves almost no consistency if someone is trying to articulately mask or clean a sketch.\n\nFour: please let me change the paper type of each individual page. I have paid for all of the tools and I use them. I like to have journals for different focuses, and sometimes my different focuses would benefit from different paper types. I would like to keep all of my focus in one place without having to start a second journal on the same topic just to have a different paper type.\n\nFive: Black and dark paper types need to trigger the UI to switch to light toggles. When using black paper, I have to go searching for UI toggles and it’s deeply frustrating. \n\nSix: please get rid of the Wacom Pen Sync button that exists on every page. I have an Apple Pencil and will never use anything else. I get that you make this hardware, but I don’t need it visible all the time. Put it on a different options page.\n\nSeven: Allow cellular data sync. \n\nEight: The color palette system is limited, I wish it felt more like procreate.\n\nNine: placing and adjusting an image is incredibly frustrating and I hate this app to its core when I’m trying to get something done and the palm of my hand triggers the image adjust dialog.\n\nTen: Please let me doodle on the covers of the journals and overall create a more personalized user experience.\n\nEleven: Please let me stack journals, archive journals that I no longer wish to have out. This would be amazing for me as I generate a lot of content and would like to put old projects away.\n\nTwelve: I would like higher resolution pages, at least to have the option of them. Exported images are very low resolution. It would be nice if I could at least print these sketches on PAPER and have them hold a 1:1 quality with the size of my screen.. Maybe just give me the freedom to set the dimensions of a notebook? Or have it be infinitely flexible like Moleskine Flow?\n\nThirteen: searchable handwriting. I would pay for this tool.

      "# Almost perfect...., 2 stars [(IAMEGI, Apple App Store, 2018-08-01)](https://apple/3002382568)\nBamboo Paper in my honest opinion has probably the best and smoothest interface. I’ve used multiple apps for note taking, even ones that charge an arm and a leg just to be presented with some laggy or glitchy technology. But Bamboo has taken note of what true to life note taking should be like and reinvented it for a tablet. \n\nWhenever I’m taking notes with my Apple Pencil it doesn’t feel like I’m writing on a tablet, that’s how smooth it is! \n\nBut although I have a list of great things to say about it, I still have some wants from it to. This app would be my to go to app for all note taking if...\n\nA few updates came around. \n\nMy main pet peeve is the fact that notes can’t be taken on landscape. Whenever I start my notes on portrait I’m forced to keep taking them on portrait. It’d be awesome if you would incorporate the ability for the paper to rotate with the orientation desired. \n\nAlong with this, the app still glitches when zooming in and out during note taking or designing. I always get the pop up that if I turn off multitasking it’ll make it better but it actually makes it worse. So as a result, this causes unintentional writing or marks on paper. \n\nNot as major, but recording during note taking process or recording option when a note taking notebook is chosen would add a lot of value to the app.\n\nLastly, there should be more personalization options for the notebooks. I understand there are a variety of notebooks we can choose from that come with their own paper layout and cover but having the ability to interchange the covers would move this app to my #1 note taking app, actually my sole note taking app.\n\nI hope that some of these thoughts are already being worked on because I honestly can’t find a better app that makes note taking fun and stress free.",

      "# Sync only on iOS devices, 2 stars [(arqqon, Apple App Store, 2018-03-01)](https://apple/2260253691)\nApp itself does what it states except sync across devices. Precision is questionable in my experiences because I use apple pen. Compared to so many other sketching and drawing apps, bamboo paper falls short. Hand writing and line quality feels unstable. Perhaps there is a better support for Wacom pens as there is a specific connection tool just for the Wacom products. But this was something I was willing to overlook since the description states there is better quality experience through Wacom products.\n\nMy main qualm is with the fact that there is no way to transfer purchases from iOS to windows 10. On the windows app, there is no way to log into inkspace. What is the point of Wacom account if there’s no way to sign into it on the application so that you can transfer purchases and data? If you do not intend to fix this issue, please add a way for customers to be reimbursed. On top of this, when I contacted customer support, I was told there was no cross platform synchronization. If I purchased something on iOS, it stays on iOS, on iPad.\n\nOn their website, they claim the Wacom account is a wonderful way to connect apps and maintain registered products. The Wacom website provides a marketplace for apps that is, quite frankly, confusing and unusable. They display free apps that you cannot download or are missing download links. It is riddled with many missing pages or they just refuse to load. Why display bamboo paper on the marketplace if it’s not an app that can be purchased through the marketplace? Their inadequacy does not just stop there, all their services provided by their website is riddled with issues such as missing links and confusing product registration process. \n\nI do believe Wacom has great products to offer, but their services fall short in ways that add to frustration and inconvenience rather than facilitate work flow.",

I have many archived notebooks, and have come to depend heavily on this app in my work. Since I switched to the iPad Pro one and a half years ago, Bamboo Paper has been failing miserably. \nAt first there was no compatibility for iPencil - ridiculous. The resolution was horrible. They fixed those items after a few months, but unfortunately the wrist sensitivity was never improved; I am constantly erasing stray marks on the page. \nFor the past 8 months or so, I have been getting a notification to update the app. Repeatedly. It does not update. Since they created Inkspace, my notebooks do not sync in the cloud. I called support a couple of times, useless. \nThey provided an \"update\" in March that did nothing. My app did not update, as far as I know. \nNow I am furious - for the past month or two (maybe since the \"update\") my notebooks have been completely screwed up. I will open the app and have two notebooks for separate projects suddenly have the same name. The pages are still there, but since they have the same name I have no idea which book is which. I create a new notebook, and next time I open the app it copies the name AND PAGES of an existing notebook. I delete the pages in one notebook, and it wound up deleting the pages in the original notebook too. So now I can't create a new notebook, I have three notebooks with the same name, and two contain exactly zero pages - while the third has pages from a different notebook. \nUnbelievable. I'm done with Bamboo Paper, and I'm done with Wacom. Losing work history is ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. Get your act together - it's a real shame. This was a great app; not sure why they couldn't embrace Pro and iPencil right off the bat. \nBuh-bye.",

There are limited colors (no color wheel swatch) and unless you pay for the stylus ($30-$70), you're stuck with limited tools (pen, pencil, marker thing) and there is no visible way to add layers the way professionals would. I bought the $70 stylus and makes little to no difference than using my finger or a dollar store stylus. It just unlocks 3 more tools (brush, watercolor, crayon). Overall, big disappointment and reluctant to use a wacom product for art ever again. Also, I'm pretty skeptical and worried for privacy with that suspicious contract we are forced to agree to at the beginning. Still concerned about that.",

Draw, annotate, highlight anything you import.\n\nWhat more I would like to see:\nWacom needs to branch out from just the artist's features. I want a higher quality photo import even when zoomed (granted I have an old non retina iPad, but it's still poor sometimes).\n\nMore functionality with options for text input, adding straight lines, boxes, or other shapes.\n\nA PC application for viewing notebooks. The portal is ok though.\n\nIn the ink space portal, I want it to know when my iPad was in landscape view. I always use it in landscape and every PDF uploads in portrait with all of my pages sideways.

It also crashes regularly on the attempts to change the color of the stroke while writing.\n- the line goes out of sync with the tooltip of the stylus towards the right edge of the screen. The line appears too far to the left from the tip of the pen. This is not happening on the left side or in the middle of the screen. This changes when the orientation of the screen is changed, so it seems to be a software and not a hardware issue.\n- the mark on the paper appears when the pen is lifted, rather then when it touches the screen. This create a disorienting experience, especially when trying to work on small and precise strokes, because it does not allow the user to orient the initial position of the line before drawing it.",

It had become a bamboo forest. It ate a giant lilac. It grew so fast you could watch its progress over the course of the day. A couple times shoots came up under the lawn mower and flipped it over. It spread to next to the house and grew between the siding and the outer wall. Our once large yard was reduced by half. \n\nWe tried to kill it.

If you decide to keep it I suggest you get a panda for your yard to keep it managed lol. Most species of bamboo are illegal in the states and it is highly invasive.

And most spreading bamboos only occupy the first foot of the soil. \n\nTo remove; take a reciprocating saw with a pruning blade and cut into the soil in a grid pattern (make sure there are no pipes or wires first on or in the soil). Then pop out the clumps with a shovel. (Which should expose the rhizomes in the underside of the clumps.) After you get it all up (by following the rhizomes cutting in a grid), reapply your desired soil in the worked area.\n\nIf you kept the canes uncut, you would now have bamboo divisions for your bamboo loving friends (like me!) The canes on the edge of the Grove are the best divisions as long as they are 3-6 months old.\n\nTo control spreading bamboo; you take into account the top 1' to 2' of soil (as it habitates the top foot of soil) and dig either a 1'-2' deep trench around where you want it to colonize. (As bamboo is awful at adjusting for height, and will poke out the side rather then going under. Just prune off what pokes through). Or dig in a bamboo barrier around where you want it contained.\n\nBamboo is a super sequestrator by the by, and has a use sequestering carbon to fight climate change. And if no inorganic fertilizers are used it feeds mycelial networks too! Plus you can use it to make bio-char!\n\nHope you all found this helpful!\n\n## Comment ID hpjn68i with +6 score by [(Peajy, Reddit, 2021-12-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/rm3bgc/should_i_let_bamboo_take_over_this_part_of_the/hpjn68i/) (in reply to ID rm3bgc):\nBamboo is beautiful, it is also extremely hard wearing and will take over if left to it’s own accord.

That’s one of bamboo’s more exciting properties, it will put out a cane, which will reach its full height within 2-3 months and then never grow in height again, only putting out branches. Clumps of bamboo reach their full size by each year sending out successively taller shoots. Clumping bamboo definitely requires less maintenance than running bamboo in terms of keeping it contained, but it will still need water sometimes, especially in its first year. I’d recommend waiting until fall before planting, it’s a lot harder on the plant to try and get established in the heat of summer. And bamboo naturally lose leaves throughout the year, it lets them form a natural mulch. I’m not sure if there are any bamboo species that could endure a mega-drought without help. Fertilizer needs will depend on your soil.\n\n## Comment ID h3m8bch with +1 score by [(fifasol, Reddit, 2021-06-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bamboo/comments/oaj5tp/what_type_of_bamboo_species_can_grow_best_in/h3m8bch/) (in reply to ID oaj5tp):\nIm in socal, but near the coast.

Each year we get shoots coming up this time of year and they grow quickly.  I'd say the first ones showed up about 3 weeks ago and those ones are about 3 foot now.

Down the road, tho, all you'll be looking at is naked canes and the fence.

They will hide the fence when the bamboo grows tall. Think leafy w open habit (not leggy, tho) vs tight, manicured small leaf like, say, a boxwood.

I'd go with Variegated Mondo Grass (Ophiopogon jaburan ‘Vittatus’).  The variegation will bring the bamboo depth of field closer to the eye. But, since you have a small lot, Black Mondo Grass (Ophiopogon planiscapus ‘Nigrescens’), sometimes labeled as \"Black Dragon' will offer greater depth of field. Either will offer even greater attention to the canes than the lawn alone. However, teh Black Dragon will make the back of the property dark when you already have dark green evergreens along each fence side.    I would not use the variety 'Nana' as it will mimic the high turf getting lost in the process.\n\nAnother option is Japanese Forest Grass Hakonechloa macra \"Aureola'  [http://www.enchantedgardensdesign.com/blog/2018/9/7/hakone-grass-a-four-season-perennial](http://www.enchantedgardensdesign.com/blog/2018/9/7/hakone-grass-a-four-season-perennial).\n\nYet other options are Variegated Japanese Sedge(Carex morrowii 'Aurea-variegata') [https://www.monrovia.com/variegated-japanese-sedge.html](https://www.monrovia.com/variegated-japanese-sedge.html) and Carex oshimensis 'Evergold' [https://www.waltersgardens.com/variety.php?ID=CAREV](https://www.waltersgardens.com/variety.php?ID=CAREV) and Carex morrowii 'Ice Dance' [https://www.monrovia.com/ice-dance-japanese-sedge.html#:\\~:text=Carex%20morrowii%20'Ice%20Dance'&text=A%20lush%20mound%20of%20slender,growing%2C%20non%2Dinvasive%20groundcover](https://www.monrovia.com/ice-dance-japanese-sedge.html#:~:text=Carex%20morrowii%20'Ice%20Dance'&text=A%20lush%20mound%20of%20slender,growing%2C%20non%2Dinvasive%20groundcover).\n\nI also LOVE the idea of a sitting boulder, maybe two, very organic, not formal, maybe one boulder with a depression that holds water,  sandwiched within the bamboo as who doesn't like sitting on a boulder in a grove of bamboo? The boulder, or two, now becomes a destination which I like for your contemplation space.\n\nBamboo looks like Bambusa multiplex 'Golden Goddess'. It will be a striking 8-12 ft high screen if it is! PLEASE don't shear the tops into a formal hedge. Your on center spacing is fine for this well behaved clumping bamboo. NO need to remove every other one. This is a bamboo variety I've used for a privacy screen similar to your design many times. It starts getting cold sensitive around 28\\*. Although it could be a Fargesia. F. robusta, the straight species, maybe? Again, if it is F. robusta you're OK too on the spacing. It gets a bit taller than  Golden Goddess though.

Im thinking of making my lawn smaller by about 1/3 in front of my bamboo so it will be mulched. Debating whether I should plant anything in front of it after making Lawn smaller. I was thinking maybe hosta, Japanese forest grass with black mondo grass but not sure if it'll handle the afternoon sun since it'll be on the western side. I'm in zone 8b and live in Portland Oregon. What ever I plant in front will be shaded from morning and noon sun but will get afternoon sun. Will hostas/japanese forest grass/black mondo grass survive afternoon sun in Zone 8b? If not what suggestions do you have that go well with bamboo but don't obstruct the view of the bamboo? Or should I just not plant anything to highlight the bamboo hedge and simply mulch in front?\n\nCurrently on my backyard I have arborvitae on the left and right side.. Some Weigela, Rosemary, and daphne on the left, some Boxwood, barberry, western sword fern and kramer's winter heath on the right. \n\nBTW I'm making my lawn smaller because I want to mow less and make it less water intensive.\n\n## Comment ID gzk6e9b with +2 score by [(KayKid21, Reddit, 2021-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/landscaping/comments/nlkz8e/what_to_plant_in_front_of_bamboo_hedge/gzk6e9b/) (in reply to ID nlkz8e):\nThis is perfect\n\n## Comment ID gzknteg with +2 score by [(abracatastrophe, Reddit, 2021-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/landscaping/comments/nlkz8e/what_to_plant_in_front_of_bamboo_hedge/gzknteg/) (in reply to ID nlkz8e):\nWisest thing would be some form of perennial flamethrower...\n\n## Comment ID gzkpulb with +2 score by [(VegasAce23, Reddit, 2021-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/landscaping/comments/nlkz8e/what_to_plant_in_front_of_bamboo_hedge/gzkpulb/) (in reply to ID nlkz8e):\nHemp 🤫or Mary Jane\n\n## Comment ID gzkv2vg with +2 score by [(stygarfield, Reddit, 2021-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/landscaping/comments/nlkz8e/what_to_plant_in_front_of_bamboo_hedge/gzkv2vg/) (in reply to ID nlkz8e):\nNapalm.

I recently had some clumping bamboo planted in my backyard and want to intersperse some other plants on the ground. Each bamboo is spaced about six feet apart and the barrier is about two feet wide. The plants will be on the same irrigation as the bamboo, aka will gets lots of water. There’s also direct light for a couple hours each day, but the plants will be heavily shadowed by the bamboo and two trees I have. I’d love something that flowers, but my priority is something that will thrive. I’m a somewhat novice gardener so hopefully nothing too temperamental.

I learned from my neighbor that the bamboo had originated 4 houses down the block and had even crossed the alley at one point.  I ended up having to knock on doors so that all 6 homeowners with infested yards could cut down their bamboo and treat the stumps at the same time.  One homeowner was elderly and too poor to hire anyone to get rid of it; another was a landlord who didn't care.  The other homeowners pitched in to get rid of it in their yards \n\nI spent hours and hours over 4 months getting rid of the bamboo in my yard and in the alley behind my house, an area that was probably 40'×45' of solid bamboo.  By the time I was done getting rid of it, I had carpal tunnel in both hands and had trigger fingers in all my fingers except my left pinky.  The inflammation got so bad I had to go on prednisone for several weeks.  Even after cutting down all the existing stalks, it took 3 more years of destroying the new growth after every rain before it was completely gone.\n\nThe reason I typed all this up is to illustrate how serious I am when I say that if I were your neighbor I would hate your guts and would seek out every legal remedy I could, including filing a lawsuit.\n\n## Comment ID isw6k6r with +9 score by [(hotttsauce84, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AustinGardening/comments/y7ev5y/best_plants_to_coplantcompanion_plant_with_bamboo/isw6k6r/) (in reply to ID y7ev5y):\nI know you probably don’t want to hear this because it’s likely you spent money to have that bamboo planted, but as others have said, remove it immediately. Your future self will thank you. Not only do you risk pissing off all of your neighbors for a 50 yard radius, and even if you don’t plan to live there for more than a couple years so don’t care about the long-term headache, you also severely risk fucking up the resale value of your home.

It weaves through it and adds color and a little “control”.\n\n### Comment ID isy06eo with +2 score by [(passing_plant_zaddy, Reddit, 2022-10-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AustinGardening/comments/y7ev5y/best_plants_to_coplantcompanion_plant_with_bamboo/isy06eo/) (in reply to ID isxyxnf):\nI planted Weaver’s Bamboo (aka Graceful Bamboo or bambusa textilis gracilis).

Again I know a million people will say “yeah but what about this one exception to the rule” but my time is valuable and the less I’m fussing with my plants, the better it is for everyone. Moss poles require constant moisture to actually be useful which requires multiple waterings a week which requires messing with plants when we all got shit to do, yo.\n\nI buy bundles of 4 foot bamboo sticks that I cut for whatever size range. I’ve started to standardize my cuts based on my space and plant pot sizes. Once plants start to get really big in 5-6inch pots at about 2-3 feet tall, I use larger 6 foot thicker bamboo poles. My plants are all climbing like crazy and throwing out larger, more mature leaves and I’m happy as can be. They are easier to move around with poles vs those big moss things, aren’t tipsy and are extremely cost effective.\n\nYour syngonium does not need a moss pole. It could be beneficial to stake it with a bamboo pole and you will have more time and money to spend on more plants going this route.\n\nSide note, people say “I like that natural look” of the pole and I hear you. My counter to that is That you can play with using multiple bamboo poles in various ways to really highlight the plants form in a way that a single moss pole can’t.  You also don’t have to deal with constant moss mess everywhere. You can also use natural sticks that have more organic looks to the setup in certain situations (depends on tree type, plant type and not recommend for long term staking).\n\nHope this helps and good luck!\n\n### Comment ID ixxglaa with +5 score by [(SouthsidePlantDaddy, Reddit, 2022-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Syngonium/comments/z5fgkp/moss_poles_for_syngs_yes_or_no/ixxglaa/) (in reply to ID ixvszo5):\nI disagree. The reason you don’t see suppliers using sphagnum moss poles is because sphagnum   Is expensive and there is no reason for them to invest that amount of resources (the time to attach/monitor the plant on the pole and the overhead cost) if it’s ultimately no an aesthetic the consumer may even want. They send them out unstaked because it is then up to you to do with them what you will. \n\nI 100% think you should use a sphagnum pole. I have all of my aroids on them and will never stop using them. Unless you are more interested in draping plants, I can’t see a reason not to use them. The plants grow faster and larger, fewer chances of under watering or over watering, more humidity in the area around the pole, ideal support, and they just look great! \n\nI’ve never seen someone make a pole the way you have, but that would be an incredibly useful way to propagate. You can just open up the pole and clean away the sphagnum. I use cylinder poles, so when I propagate a plant that’s grown on the pole, I have to work the roots back through the holes of the actual pole. I may steal this for my propagation plants.

You keep your humidity up and that encourages airroots who grow no matter what and if they want they can attach to bamboo but the whole point is less focus on constantly keeping things moist for plants that probably aren’t going to be worth the energy to put in a second root set like a albo syngonium. The poles are just their to help hold the stems up via tie ups but that’s about it. \n\nThe difference is a mosspole takes a ton of pot real estate, takes a ton of resources to put together and if you are keeping both dry, then probably it’s worth going the simplest, cheapest way which is just bamboo.\n\n### Comment ID lo269gk with +1 score by [(The_best_is_yet, Reddit, 2024-09-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Syngonium/comments/z5fgkp/moss_poles_for_syngs_yes_or_no/lo269gk/) (in reply to ID ixvszo5):\nthank you for sharing this!

BUT... they are both on loooong single, kinda thin, main stems. I have been intrigued watching the Leca Queen and others on YT with their moss poles.   \nToday I took the plunge and made 2 (wonky) moss poles for these syngs, and repottted them. I also chopped the WB.  \nI am scared because the moss poles seem all wrong. I made them from a plastic mesh (I couldn't find any wire square or plastic squares like the one she used) I made like a \"u\" shape, I had seen this done with clear plastic- and it has the side towards the stem open. The thing is, they don't seem tall enough. To make sure the pot didn't tip over (that moss got so heavy when wet!) I had to use a larger pot than I wanted...  \nNow I am stressing because the stem is against the damp moss, and especially my WB doesn't have too many nodes along that part of the stem. The moss pole wasn't nearly tall enough. It looks dumb.  \nWill the nodes from the bare stem grow into the moss? What do you do as it grows, this pole can end up being 8 ft tall!  \nI also see some people just let their syngs vine, how is this done without the plant getting all top-heavy and snapping?  \nAlso, I don't personally like the look of the 3-lobed mature leaf. How do you prevent those from happening?  \nUgh- I think I prematurely thought the moss pole was going to be the answer to these plants growing larger and larger, but now a. I'm not even sure I LIKE moss poles, and b. I'm afraid I did something to make these plants stress out and die.  \nAnyone with experience, let me know what you did!\n\n## Comment ID ixvtouq with +3 score by [(Reveal_Simple, Reddit, 2022-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Syngonium/comments/z5fgkp/moss_poles_for_syngs_yes_or_no/ixvtouq/) (in reply to ID z5fgkp):\nCheck out “lazy moss poles” by unplantparenthood on YouTube.\nAlso what are your goals for the plant? They can get squatty if you work at it or this fall way seems ideal for more propagation\n\n### Comment ID ixvyr9s with +1 score by [(Embarrassed_Ad_2377, Reddit, 2022-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Syngonium/comments/z5fgkp/moss_poles_for_syngs_yes_or_no/ixvyr9s/) (in reply to ID ixvtouq):\nThanks, I will check them out.\n\nI will have lots of propagations, so I can try and make a full squatty one, which is I think what I personally prefer.\n\n#### Comment ID ixw0u03 with +3 score by [(Reveal_Simple, Reddit, 2022-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Syngonium/comments/z5fgkp/moss_poles_for_syngs_yes_or_no/ixw0u03/) (in reply to ID ixvyr9s):\nSomeone great at syngoniums told me when you are rooting a cutting, cut back the first time it tries to vine and it will be squattier.

Planks work the best for me. They are rough enough for the roots to attach while adding support for climbing.\n\n### Comment ID ixz7shx with +1 score by [(Embarrassed_Ad_2377, Reddit, 2022-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Syngonium/comments/z5fgkp/moss_poles_for_syngs_yes_or_no/ixz7shx/) (in reply to ID ixywapx):\nI am now considering putting my scindapsis exotica on a plant.

I glue them together for height. Some I have painted to look pretty but the paint is thin enough that the wood is still rough so the roots attach pretty easily.

They’re both invasive af, maybe I can create some balance and get some good berries?  \n\n\nThoughts?\n\n## Comment ID jqep4pi with +3 score by [(up2late, Reddit, 2023-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/14ounew/bamboo_vs_blackberries/jqep4pi/) (in reply to ID 14ounew):\nBamboo will win.

It would be a lot of work to eradicate the roots that have already spread past where you want them. My wife just mows them down as she cuts the grass. We have 2 types of giant timber bamboo and if she goes more than a week between mowings during the spring they can get out of hand.\n\n## Comment ID jqflh4l with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/14ounew/bamboo_vs_blackberries/jqflh4l/) (in reply to ID 14ounew):\nIf you need something to prevent the spread of bamboo just use a lawn mower. By mowing over the new shoots, you won't be able to see them and after a few growing seasons they should stop bothering you as they are trained to not grow in your direction\n\n### Comment ID jqhgv1n with +1 score by [(Altruistic_Key_1266, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/14ounew/bamboo_vs_blackberries/jqhgv1n/) (in reply to ID jqflh4l):\nLawn mower is quite enough with this variety. Beginning in April, shoots start about 3 inches around and shoot up 3-4 ft a day, and by day two, the bottom portions have already turned woody. I have to walk out , every day until the beginning of June, and dig up new stalks as they appear, because they also cluster. Kicking down one stalk results in 2-4 more a few days later. It’s like the frickin Hydra from Heracles.\n\n## Comment ID jqh75lb with +2 score by [(AuntieDawnsKitchen, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/14ounew/bamboo_vs_blackberries/jqh75lb/) (in reply to ID 14ounew):\nIt’s like Alien v Predator: Whoever wins, we lose\n\nThe real winners would be the birds, since the bamboo would keep you from harvesting the berries, they could chow down. And then spread blackberry seed all over the known universe. But are blackberries from seed fast enough to compete with the sheer power of the bamboo runners?\n\nIt would be a hell of a cage match, but with no cage"

It sounds like you worked here in the early days of the creative team when it was separated as an R&amp;D effort, but you'll be happy to know that is no longer the case. Creative team members are integrated into account teams now and are extremely central to what we do! \n\n2. I am no longer involved in sales and I definitely agree with your critique. Account teams are now involved pre-sale for the clients they would be owning and it's going a lot smoother as a result!\n\n3. The \"group project\" call out is fair, though I think that was mostly due to our matrixed org structure. It made things difficult for us as we outgrew it. It was often unclear who the one person responsible for various things were. Too many approvals and too much consensus was required. We're now reorganizing into pods to fix this empower more leaders across the business. Definitely agree and understand this critique from the past though!\n\n4. The one thing I have to call out is that we are not and have never been \"a revolving door of clients\". We have very strong client retention and that has always been the case. I'm not sure if this happened on your clients specifically but I want to assure future team members and clients that this is not the case.\n\nThanks for what you put into Bamboo and again, I hope you found a better fit!",

It's a young company and management is always seeking input on ways to improve (see the detailed and sincere responses to the negative reviews for examples), but will also invest heavily in helping its people to grow in their role and intended career path. Even when debating whether to leave to pursue a dream career change, everyone was very supportive and positive. Bamboo really celebrates the accomplishments of all its employees (current and former) out of genuine care.\r\n\r\nFairly solid benefits in terms of health, dental, and vision, with stock options, flexible PTO (and you are actually encouraged to use it) and a generous but reasonable work from home policy. The work-life balance is also very good. \r\nMinor perks include a lounge stocked with snacks and a rotating schedule for people to bring their dogs into the office - as long as they're well behaved. \r\n\r\nThe team environment is great. Everyone is very friendly and casual and tries to make the day enjoyable, though will also be respectful and professional where needed. Management works hard to resolve even minor interpersonal conflicts from differences in work style so that everyone is content. There are many opportunities to connect with others inside and outside of work, though no major peer pressure as can sometimes occur at startups or in agency environments. Even during the pandemic, Bamboo did its best to attend to employee needs and set up virtual social events, from yoga and workouts to language lessons to involved happy hours.",

Today, many companies think they can check their diversity box by hiring women, and non-blacks, while not truly addressing the deeper cultural and institutional issues they have. Bamboo manages to model this standard with its white male-centered-bro-y culture.\r\n\r\nI didn't not realize my how much my experience at Bamboo had taken a toll on my life/stress, work-life-balance, and health until I left.\r\n\r\nWhen I joined Bamboo there was one Black man at the company. When I left there was still only one...\r\n\r\nMy team unfortunately was very unstable due to nepotism and the micro-aggressions that management got away with expressing toward their team members. This created an isolating environment for the mostly women and women of color that my boss acted out against.  \r\n\r\nWhat made it even more uncomfortable during my time at Bamboo was their performative acts towards transparency and how they quickly developed ambiguous performance evaluation processes to stifle employees from advancing and creating false expectations that they themselves did not live up to. \r\n\r\nThe company chooses the old school approach of vetting incoming candidates for \"cultural fit\" via macho whiskey meetings—making it easier to bring friends in. What resulted is the cliquey environment I found myself in—where like minds thrived, and diverse challenges to the \"tech world standard\" were seen as illegitimate or frowned upon. \r\n\r\nBamboo's HR and management teams lack the experience and training in diversity, inclusion and empathy to address deeply entrenched issues within the company. It's sad that many end up being singled out and unheard because of bias. I'd say run the other direction if you are looking for true growth and a company that values their people as much as their profit.",

              "response": "Hi there! Thank you for sharing feedback and for working at Bamboo. I'll try and address some of your review as best I can!\n\n1. The reason we don't negotiate salaries is because we want to make sure we have compensation methodology that is as equity and fair as possible. Negotiated salaries often introduce more gender or other pay disparities systematically (because white people and especially men tend to negotiate while underrepresented groups tend to not) and we want to avoid that. Here is a good overview on this POV if it's of interest: https://www.forbes.com/sites/financialfinesse/2018/04/11/a-powerful-way-to-close-the-pay-gap-dont-negotiate-salaries/?sh=7048f4e72209).\n\nIf it felt manipulative when I shared our policy with you, I probably should've done a better job explaining the \"why\" and I'll be sure we do that better going forward. Thank you again for sharing the feedback.\n\n2. On salaries, I'm not sure when you left Bamboo but we actually increased pay across the board for 2021 going forward so I agree with you on this! We could've paid better (we used to pay at 50th percentile) and now we do.\n\n3. I 100% agree that we more diversity across our teams. I started Bamboo as a 23 year old with two ex-coworkers, who were both white and from Michigan/Ohio. We should've prioritized diversity way earlier on, but we did a bad job at it in our first few years. This is a big focus for us going forward and making Bamboo as an inclusive a place as possible has been a big focus for us since 2020 (which is not soon enough!). We are also investing in more macro racial justice efforts as well (you can read more about that here: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6755176153276846080)\n\n4. I don't have enough details about your unique situation (\"team player\" doesn't clarify much, which is totally fine as I know you'd like to stay anonymous!), but we really try and train our coaches and leadership to empower their teams with autonomy and goal ownership at Bamboo. If you were or felt micromanaged in some way, I apologize for that. I encourage anyone who interviews with us to ask about what's it like working here day-to-day as they interview with folks across the team. I am certain this response would be very far from norm.\n\nThanks again for leaving feedback and for helping us build Bamboo. I really appreciate it!!",

Today, many companies think they can check their diversity box by hiring women, and non-blacks, while not truly addressing the deeper cultural and institutional issues they have. Bamboo manages to model this standard with its white male-centered-bro-y culture.\r\n\r\nI didn't not realize my how much my experience at Bamboo had taken a toll on my life/stress, work-life-balance, and health until I left.\r\n\r\nWhen I joined Bamboo there was one Black man at the company. When I left there was still only one...\r\n\r\nMy team unfortunately was very unstable due to nepotism and the micro-aggressions that management got away with expressing toward their team members. This created an isolating environment for the mostly women and women of color that my boss acted out against.  \r\n\r\nWhat made it even more uncomfortable during my time at Bamboo was their performative acts towards transparency and how they quickly developed ambiguous performance evaluation processes to stifle employees from advancing and creating false expectations that they themselves did not live up to. \r\n\r\nThe company chooses the old school approach of vetting incoming candidates for \"cultural fit\" via macho whiskey meetings—making it easier to bring friends in. What resulted is the cliquey environment I found myself in—where like minds thrived, and diverse challenges to the \"tech world standard\" were seen as illegitimate or frowned upon. \r\n\r\nBamboo's HR and management teams lack the experience and training in diversity, inclusion and empathy to address deeply entrenched issues within the company. It's sad that many end up being singled out and unheard because of bias. I'd say run the other direction if you are looking for true growth and a company that values their people as much as their profit.",

Bamboo really celebrates the accomplishments of all its employees (current and former) out of genuine care.\r\n\r\nFairly solid benefits in terms of health, dental, and vision, with stock options, flexible PTO (and you are actually encouraged to use it) and a generous but reasonable work from home policy. The work-life balance is also very good. \r\nMinor perks include a lounge stocked with snacks and a rotating schedule for people to bring their dogs into the office - as long as they're well behaved. \r\n\r\nThe team environment is great. Everyone is very friendly and casual and tries to make the day enjoyable, though will also be respectful and professional where needed. Management works hard to resolve even minor interpersonal conflicts from differences in work style so that everyone is content. There are many opportunities to connect with others inside and outside of work, though no major peer pressure as can sometimes occur at startups or in agency environments.

      "# [The big British bamboo crisis: ‘It invaded my beautiful home’ by Simon Usborne, www.theguardian.com, simon-usborne on 2024-06-11](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/11/big-british-bamboo-crisis-invaded-my-beautiful-home)\nIsobel Chetwood moved to her dream home on her birthday just over a decade ago. As she wound up a 40-year career in the NHS as a GP practice manager in Stockport, Greater Manchester, she was keen to return to her roots in Cheshire. She settled in a comfortable house in the quiet village of Plumley.\n\nChetwood, 68, lives alone. When she moved in, she found a gardener (“I don’t do dirt down me fingernails,” she says, laughing). He made her a raised bed for growing strawberries, alongside a fence that divided her garden from her neighbour’s. “It was beautiful out there,” she says.\n\nAll was well until – a little over two years ago – alien shoots began rising like spears from the soil around her strawberry plants, having somehow found a way through the heavy railway sleepers and bricks used to build the bed.\n\nThe new plants grew incredibly quickly – and multiplied. Chetwood identified them as bamboo. She suspected they had spread from a plant that the previous tenants in the rented house next door had put in years ago as a living screen.\n\nShe alerted the landlord, who assaulted the bamboo with shears and weedkiller. But the attack only hastened the plant’s spread. “The new tenants had two little children and a dog and there were these really sharp spears of bamboo coming up all over their lawn,” Chetwood says. She began to get anxious. “It felt like this was an invasion of my beautiful home.”\n\nChetwood had become the latest victim of a growing problem that is striking fear into the hearts of homeowners across the country. It is leaving many locked in bitter disputes or facing astonishing bills for work to rip out the plants and rebuild their gardens.\n\nCertain varieties of bamboo that were planted clumsily while the plant was in peak fashion in the 90s and 00s have been silently and invisibly burrowing through garden topsoil. Now, they are rising up, punching through paving stones, asphalt and even the foundations of houses as they dominate any plant life they encounter.\n\n“Bamboo has become the next Japanese knotweed,” says Emily Grant, the director of operations at Environet, a UK specialist in surveying and removing invasive plants. The plants have much in common, having been imported to Britain more than a century ago as exotic ornamental novelties, only to spread underground using creeping stems called rhizomes.\n\nThe biggest difference, Grant says, is awareness. Environet recently added questions about bamboo to its annual survey, conducted by YouGov. “In our latest research, 71% of people weren’t aware that bamboo could cause any damage and 84% were not aware that it could prompt legal claims between neighbours or hinder property sales.”\n\nMoreover, because bamboo is often planted intentionally on garden boundaries as a natural fence, the chances of neighbourly disputes are higher than with other plants. And because bamboo can take a decade or more to mature, the problem is often passed on to unwitting owners or tenants before the first shoots start to appear.\n\nThere are no restrictions on planting bamboo or any legal requirements to declare its presence when selling a house, as is the case with Japanese knotweed, because it is not legally classified as an invasive species. Yet Grant says a fast-spreading bamboo plant can be just as destructive as Japanese knotweed.\n\nInquiries about it flood Environet’s Surrey HQ at a rate of 20 a day in the summer, when growth is most rampant. “We started out as 100% focused on Japanese knotweed, but in the three years since we started to offer bamboo removal services, it’s now about 50:50,” Grant says. “And it’s not that we were turning away bamboo work before. We just weren’t seeing the demand.”\n\nThe climate crisis may be a factor. “Warmer summers mean the soils are heating up more than they used to and the plants are able to spread faster,” says Susanne Lucas, an American horticulturist who began specialising in bamboo in the late 80s. She is the CEO of the World Bamboo Organization, which promotes bamboo conservation and the plant’s use in industries such as construction.\n\nGrant blames a careless rush to buy bamboo in the 90s and 00s, driven partly by the aspirational gardening shows that filled the TV schedules. Back then, ignorance dominated the supply chain, particularly when it came to making the vital distinction between bamboo species, of which there are more than 1,000 in the world: is it a “runner” or a “clumper”?\n\nClumping bamboos tend to grow only upwards and produce new shoots close to the original root ball. For the UK climate, Lucas recommends the fargesia and borinda genera. These varieties now dominate bamboo sales at garden centres, where labelling typically reassures buyers that the plants are clumping and non-invasive.\n\nRunning bamboos are the ones to avoid. They have evolved to colonise surrounding ground to create forests, sending out rhizomes that can reach several metres in every direction. Each rhizome produces knuckle-like nodes, from which thick new shoots then reach for the light.\n\nThese shoots “come up through the ground at the diameter of the finished bamboo cane”, Grant says. “So they might be 2cm or 3cm across, pushing through the ground at that diameter with a huge amount of force. I get a bit of a shiver down my spine when I see people have planted the more exotic varieties, which can be 10cm across.”\n\nIf anything, Chetwood got off lightly. She was terrified about what might be happening in her garden when she began looking up bamboo problems online, where horror stories abound. The worst case Environet has dealt with began in 2019 with a call from a homeowner who spotted a bamboo shoot rising up from behind the skirting boards inside their house in Hampshire. Another shoot had punched through a plaster wall in the sitting room.\n\nSurveyors lifted floorboards to discover that a vast web of rhizomes had been spreading under the house for years, originating from a neighbour’s garden. The only reliable way to remove bamboo is to excavate all the rhizomes. In this case, that meant ripping out all the floorboards and tiles across the ground level, as well as the kitchen and a bathroom, then using a digger and spades to pull out hundreds of metres of runners.\n\nThe final bill came to more than £100,000. It was covered by home insurance, but the family had to live in a temporary home for months while builders put their house back together.\n\nIn Northamptonshire, a retired homeowner who had planted bamboo more than a decade earlier returned home from a holiday in 2022 to find a shoot growing out of his oven. Work to remove all the rhizomes ended up costing him more than £6,000.\n\nGrant says home insurers typically decide that planting bamboo amounts to negligence – the horticultural equivalent of leaving a tap running and flooding a bathroom. Where damage is caused by a plant on a neighbouring property, that neighbour’s policy may cover the work on the other side of the fence.\n\n“I think it was knocking on the door of about £6,000 on my side and I was worried I was going to have to pay,” says Chetwood, who called in Environet. In the end, she was fortunate to have a sympathetic landlord next door, whose insurer paid for the excavation on Chetwood’s side of the fence (although he had to cough up for the work in his own garden).\n\nBeverley wasn’t so lucky. The retired nurse and her husband moved into a new-build house in Hastings in 2006. A gardener put in two bamboo plants for screening the year after. Almost 15 years later, the plant had spread beneath her and her neighbour’s gardens and shoots were beginning to pop up. “My neighbour was a bit annoyed,” says Beverley, 75. “Then it came so close to the house and I got really scared.”\n\nIn the past two years, Beverley and her husband have spent almost £10,000 on excavation and the reinstatement of a short public path between the gardens (the bamboo broke the heavy slabs). “It’s a huge expense that we could really have done without, but there’s nothing we can do about it,” she says.\n\nAs well as buying clearly marked clumping varieties from reputable suppliers, gardeners should contain bamboo plants, as a precaution, and keep an eye on them. Keeping them in pots, whether buried or on the ground, can help, as can regularly digging a trench around plants to cut off new rhizomes. Vertical root barriers – essentially hard plastic sheeting buried to stop lateral growth – are widely available in gardening shops.\n\n“But containment is only as good as the monitoring of it,” says Grant. “We often see rhizomes jumping over root barriers or breaking through pots.” Left to their own devices, clumping varieties can also cause problems as their root balls expand, especially if planted against fences or walls.\n\nWhile no law governs the planting or declaration of bamboo (Grant urges buyers to include a check for bamboo in any survey), owners or occupiers may be able to issue proceedings against a neighbour who won’t take responsibility for problem plants under “common law nuisance”. This includes encroachment on a neighbour’s land, damage to a neighbour’s land or interference with a neighbour’s enjoyment of their land.\n\n“We’re seeing a big increase in people bringing claims against uncooperative neighbours,” says Grant, whose colleagues are often called as expert witnesses in such cases. She recommends starting with a chat and then a more formal letter or email if nothing changes. “If an owner has been notified and failed to act, that’s when you can pursue them legally,” she says. “But it can be a lengthy process, and obviously you have to live with your neighbour from then on, so it’s not an ideal course of action.”\n\nChetwood and Beverley were both lucky: after initial angst, relations with their neighbours were civil. No solicitors were required. Both victims of invasive bamboo are still waiting out the five-year guarantees they paid for on top of the removal work. During this time, their excavation sites are monitored for regrowth, as any piece of rhizome left behind can take root.\n\n“They found some very small shoots the first time and then last February they came for the annual check and there was nothing at all,” Chetwood says. “My garden is all back as it was.” Her strawberry plants didn’t survive, but she is happy with the turf that now borders the fence, which no longer has additional screening. “I certainly wouldn’t get any more bamboo,” she says. “People just stick it in the ground and think it’ll be all right, but it won’t.”",

However, bamboo-starch composites have potential drawbacks, such as poor mechanical strength, water sensitivity and processing costs.\n\nTo make bamboo-based thermosetting plastic on an industrial scale, the researchers ground bamboo into powder and used eco-friendly chemicals to remove part of the lignin – the organic substance binding the cell structures, giving the stalks their rigidity – and disturb the structure of another cellular component in the cells.",

      "# [Bamboo furniture and handicraft training revitalize Vizimumba community by Lydia Amanzi on 2024-09-09](https://forestsnews.cifor.org/89370/bamboo-furniture-and-handicraft-training-empowers-vizimumba-community?fnl=)\nClack. Tap. Clack. The rhythmic sound of hammers striking bamboo fills the air, breaking through cheerful conversations and bursts of laughter. On the ground, bamboo shavings blend with the red dust of the earth, and a sense of anticipation hangs in the humid air.\n\nTwenty-six Vizimumba Information Center (VIC) members in Nyimba District of Eastern Province, Zambia, recently completed a transformative training program. This diverse group, split between men and women, including many youths, spent ten days learning the art of crafting furniture and other products from the indigenous Savannah Bamboo (Oxytenanthera abyssinica). The training, held under the Zambia for Agroforestry, Biodiversity, and Climate (Z4ABC) project, aimed to enhance bamboo craftsmanship in the community.\n\nGuided by expert trainers from the International Network of Bamboo and Rattan (INBAR), participants mastered a wide range of techniques, including bending, straightening, processing materials, joinery, assembly, weaving, finishing, treatment, and preservation. They learned to produce high-quality bamboo furniture, including chairs, tables, stools and decorative woven baskets. The training, which ran from 8 to 19 July 2024, attracted both seasoned artisans and newcomers eager to expand their skills and create new opportunities for themselves.\n\nThe hands-on approach to the training ensured that participants gained theoretical knowledge and practical skills essential for sustainable bamboo craftsmanship. Divided into small groups, they learnt how to select and prepare bamboo poles, cut and measure materials, and apply various joining techniques. The use of traditional bamboo nails and natural adhesives offered a cost-effective alternative to conventional fasteners, reflecting the programme’s emphasis on resourcefulness and sustainability.\n\n“We have taught them how to make bamboo office chairs, tables, stools, and weaving techniques,” said Donald Khibuti, a consultant bamboo artisan from INBAR and leader of the training workshop. “Over the last 17 years, I have traveled in the region to provide guidance and enhance the skills of local artisans who lacked professional training.”\n\nParticipants also delved into bamboo’s environmental benefits, understanding its role in climate change mitigation and its potential to replace plastic products, thereby reducing pollution. The programme highlighted bamboo’s value as a renewable resource that supports sustainable development and fosters resilience against climate change.\n\n“This workshop has given us new skills to create unique products for sale,” Mary Mbewe, one of the trainees, expressed with gratitude. Meanwhile, a young artisan, John Tembo, was optimistic about his future: “With this knowledge, we can save money by using bamboo nails and glue instead of fasteners.”\n\nThe programme also introduced modern carpentry tools to complement traditional techniques, enabling artisans to produce more durable and eco-friendly products. This blend of innovation and tradition enriches the community’s craftsmanship and aligns with broader environmental goals, such as reducing deforestation and increasing carbon sequestration.\n\nThe training marks a significant step toward sustainable livelihood development in Vizimumba. The participants are now equipped to produce market-ready bamboo furniture and handicrafts, fostering job opportunities and self-employment within the province. Moreover, the new skills acquired will be shared with other community members, amplifying the training’s impact across the district.\n\nBamboo has long been a versatile resource for the people of Vizimumba Ward, and this training represents a renewed commitment to sustainably harnessing its potential. As the project continues to support the community, the aim is to ensure that bamboo remains a vital part of daily life, contributing to economic growth and environmental resilience.\n\nWellington Chazya, the pilot landscape coordinator for the project, highlighted the introduction of modern carpentry tools that complement traditional techniques to ensure the sustainable use of bamboo. “We want to enhance their skills to match modern production styles, support their artisan trade, and enhance their livelihoods.”\n\nChazya also mentioned previous training implemented by the project on establishing a bamboo nursery and planting bamboo within homesteads and field boundaries, which reduced the need for long-distance resource collection.\n\nBamboo plays a multi-functional role in Vizimumba Ward, supporting many livelihoods. The Z4ABC project collaborates with the community to ensure sustainable bamboo production, reducing pressure on forest resources and enhancing resilience to climate change.\n\nThis training marks a significant step toward sustainable livelihood development, empowering the Vizimumba community with valuable skills and knowledge in bamboo furniture and handicraft manufacturing.\n\nAbout Z4ABC\n\nThe Z4ABC project is a four-year project targeted at contributing to climate-relevant, productive and sustainable transformation of agriculture and food systems. Additionally, it will provide scientific support for developing partnerships to support local solutions and address the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It will be implemented in targeted areas in the Lower Zambezi – Luangwa – Nyika (ZLN) landscape to support the integrated transformation of selected agriculture, forestry, and wildlife-based value chains (VCs) in the ZLN corridor to become more sustainable, climate-resilient, and productive whilst supporting local livelihoods, food security, resilient food systems and protecting biodiversity. The project will contribute to Zambia’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) to the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change to cut emissions and adapt to climate impacts in the country.",

The eight-day exercise will take place in various locations across the United States as well as designated sea and airspace in the eastern Pacific.\n\nRed Flag 24-1 served as the tactical build up to the operational implementation of multi-domain, combat readiness training that is Bamboo Eagle.\n\n“Bamboo Eagle is designed to provide advanced training in a disaggregated, multi-domain scenario in order to sustain and strengthen the ability of the joint and coalition force to prevail in conflict when necessary,” said Maj. Gen. Case Cunningham, USAFWC commander.\n\nThe inclusion of training in eastern Pacific, sea and airspace, allows for warfighters to train in a combat representative environment and will incorporate scenarios in the maritime domain.\n\nWarfighters will implement all-domain combat-power generation from multiple basing locations throughout the western part of the U.S., while conducting distributed command and control, agile logistics, and air-to-air refueling.",

Hosted by the U.S. Air Force Warfare Center at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, flight operations will occur in designated airspace off the coast of Southern California through Feb. 2.\n\nBamboo Eagle begins on the heels of Red Flag 24-1, which serves as the tactical build up to Bamboo Eagle’s operational implementation of multi-domain, combat readiness training. The inclusion of a maritime training zone over the Pacific allows for combat warfighters to train in a combat representative environment and will incorporate scenarios in the joint maritime domain.\n\nWarfighters will implement all-domain combat-power generation from disaggregated basing locations throughout the western part of the U.S., while incorporating scenarios in distributed command and control, agile logistics, and tactical air-to-air refueling from Air Mobility Command. Part of that aerial refueling will be powered by KC-46A aircraft and Airmen from the 22nd Air Refueling Wing, heading to numerous locations to participate in Bamboo Eagle.\n\n“We’re looking forward to working jointly with the other units and airframes to provide tactical aerial refueling, while accomplishing our own learning objectives for Bamboo Eagle, and the opportunity to support all-domain combat power generation. This will be a fantastic training opportunity to work with other services and international partners, to fuel all-domain combat-power generation,” said Capt. Corey Dickey, 349th Air Refueling Squadron and McConnell’s detachment commander for Bamboo Eagle.\n\nApproximately 3,000 U.S. service members across four branches are expected to fly, maintain and support more than 150 aircraft from 24 units in more than 10 locations during Bamboo Eagle. Additionally, close to 300 joint and interagency allies and partners from the Royal Air Force and Royal Australian Air Force are also participating to make the nation’s forces stronger. Exercising with allies and partners enables the U.S. to improve interoperability and train in a way that reflects coalition forces in a future fight.",

Col. Brandon Nauta, the 65th Aggressor Squadron commander. “During execution, the aggressor units execute what they have been planning the past 6 months and put the participants to the test.”\n\nLt. Col. Donald Davenport, the 64th Aggressor Squadron commander, added that in this exercise Red Force provides Blue Force the opportunity to train against a realistic threat that is designing the scenarios to work to their advantage.\n\n“We can formulate scenarios to make it work on our terms which is what a real threat will do,” said Davenport. “An opportunity that has never been done before.”\n\nBamboo Eagle provides Airmen, allies and partners a versatile, realistic training environment for testing tactics, developing strategies and conducting advanced training to support U.S. national interests.\n\n“One aspect of this exercise is that we don’t fight alone,” said Nauta. “Bamboo Eagle provides an environment that we can jointly train together, both on the Blue and Red sides, and better understand how each of us operate so we are better prepared to fight together if called upon.”\n\nBamboo Eagle 24-3 includes scenarios that stress an air expeditionary wing’s ability to generate combat air power. These challenges range from arming aircraft, to keeping Airmen and assets safe from simulated missile strikes, to supplying subordinate units with the necessary equipment to sustain operations.\n\n“Bamboo Eagle provides the logistical problem that we cannot provide when training in the Nevada Test and Training Range, the tyranny of distance,” said Davenport.\n\nNauta added that instead of every participant planning missions, taking off, and debriefing from a single location, Bamboo Eagle forces participants to coordinate those efforts from multiple locations.\n\nCapt. Andrew See, a 706th Aggressor Squadron F-16 pilot, has flown several missions both during the day and at night for Bamboo Eagle 24-3, highlighted how placing the fight geographically separate from everyone’s homebase effectively simulates an austere environment.\n\n“It is more situationally realistic because of the timing and ranges involved and the added complexity of being positionally separated from homebase as compared to Red Flag where those situations are mostly simulated,” said See. “In Bamboo Eagle you’re much farther from home.”\n\nIn line with the Department of the Air Force’s reoptimization efforts for Great Power Competition and as the Department of Defense’s only F-35A aggressor squadron, the 65th Aggressor Squadron represents the most capable and technologically advanced professional adversary replication unit specifically designed to train the warfighter against current and future near-peer threats.\n\n“A fifth-generation platform for the 65th Aggressors allows us to leverage exquisite capabilities to provide training for Bamboo Eagle participants against current near-peer and future threat capabilities that is not often replicated at home station training,” said Nauta. “There is a shock factor initially, but as the days and weeks go on with this training, it is encouraging to see how the participants think creatively allowing them to adapt for mission success.”\n\nModern warfare encompasses multiple domains, complex high-end conflict and requires improved joint interoperability, faster data sharing and unified command and control across all warfighting domains.\n\n“Bamboo Eagle 24-3 represents the most realistic live fly and virtual operational and tactical level training that a combat Airman, Guardian, Sailor, or Marine will face in training,” said Nauta. “So the saying goes, ‘As iron sharpens iron’, the Bamboo Eagle 24-3 participants will come out of this exercise ready to face any challenge.”",

      "# [SIU researchers study how giant cane bamboo remnants affect ecosystems by Tim Crosby](https://news.siu.edu/2024/07/072424-siu-researchers-study-how-giant-cane-bamboo-remnants-affect-ecosystems.php)\nby Tim Crosby\n\nCARBONDALE, Ill. – Two researchers from Southern Illinois University Carbondale are studying the role remnants of a once common bamboo species plays in improving soil and water, supporting wildlife and the effects of nearby forests.\n\nJim Zaczek, professor of forestry in the School of Forestry and Horticulture, and Thanchira “M.J.” Suriyamongkol, a graduate student with SIU’s Cooperative Wildlife Research Laboratory, are studying giant cane, a woody perennial bamboo species native to the United States and found across 22 southeastern states from Maryland across Southern Illinois and eastern Oklahoma, and down to east Texas and Florida.\n\nUsing a grant from the Illinois Native Plant Society, along with support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Program, the two are investigating the relationship between canebrake growth and forest characteristics, specifically assessing the impact of forest canopy cover and the cane’s density, height and coverage area.\n\nThe work could provide clues for better management of the species to improve its overall health and protect its important place in the ecosystem, including its role as a mitigator of agricultural runoff.\n\nAn iconic plant\n\nGiant cane – or Arundinaria gigantea – historically has covered large swaths of the southeast. The plant typically grows densely on ground called “canebrakes,” a common sight in such areas.\n\nHuman activities, including land-clearing, agriculture, fire suppression, and livestock overgrazing, have drastically reduced its abundance. Scientists now believe that only 2% of canebrake habitat remains.\n\nPrevious studies indicate giant cane could be a good candidate as a riparian buffer species, especially against agricultural runoff, Suriyamongkol said.\n\n“It improves soil and water quality, increasing soil infiltration rate and enhancing soil organic matter,” she said.\n\nThe plant also provides a habitat that supports diverse wildlife species of both vertebrates and invertebrates, though less is known about how Southern Illinois wildlife use it.\n\n“In Southern Illinois, studies have been limited to species of concern, such as Swainson’s warbler,” Suriyamongkol said. “But we know it also supports a diverse wildlife community, with more than 70 species of wildlife observed using the canebrakes for nesting, feeding and more.”\n\nThe study is focusing on expanding scientists’ understanding of the animals that live amid giant cane, including birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians in Southern Illinois, as well as the characteristics of canebrakes that contribute to animal habitat uses.\n\nField studies\n\nTo find out more, the researchers visited known cane patches and the areas surrounding them, looking for study sites. They ended up identifying 47 sites that met their criteria.\n\nThe researchers then took measurements of canebrakes, including height and density and area. They also examined nearby forest cover characteristics, such as tree density, area, tree height, leaf litter depth and canopy cover, along with the cover provided by other herbaceous plants and shrubs.\n\nThe researchers next used a model to look at the correlation between canebrake characteristics and the forest cover.\n\nResults…\n\nThe researchers plan to publish their findings soon and are currently writing an article describing what they found. Suriyamongkol said those findings include cane growth being limited by nearby tree canopy topping the canebrakes.\n\n“Based on the relationships between forest cover and canebrake characteristics that we observed, managing overstory trees through prescribed burning and/or thinning would promote cane growth,” she said.\n\nSuriyamongkol said the work is important because the fragmented nature of canebrakes have made it difficult to determine their impact on the environment.\n\n“Studying the remaining canebrake remnants could aid in determining their ecological value and resiliency,” she said. “Understanding canebrake status in association with forest cover could help guide management of canebrake to meet restoration goals by altering forest overstory conditions.”\n\nNOTE: Thanchira Suriyamongkol is pronounced tan-CHEE-rah su-ri-ya-mong-kol.

While melamine consumed in the short-term has low acute toxicity, long-term exposure at high levels can result in kidney damage and damage to the urinary tract.\n\nWhilst it is very unlikely that the short-term use of these products would result in an immediate risk to health, the FSA and FSS recommends reducing exposure to these products as the long-term impacts from regular use of these items remains unclear.\n\nTherefore, the FSA and FSS are advising that these products should remain unavailable for sale in Great Britain (GB) and people should dispose of them or repurpose if they still have them in their homes.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, these products have already been prohibited for sale as a food contact material, following the European Commission Food Contact Material legislation and businesses continue to comply with this ruling.\n\nThe advice does not apply to items made solely from bamboo or plant-based materials, only those products which use a combination of plastic and plant-based materials. Businesses are being asked to take care to check that any bamboo or similar-plant products remaining on the market do not contain any plastic components.\n\nDr James Cooper, deputy director of food policy at the FSA said:\n\n\"At the Food Standards Agency, our mission is to ensure food is safe and this also includes ensuring the products which come into contact with our food, such as containers and utensils, are safe too.\n\n“Following our robust risk assessment process, we have found there to be insufficient evidence to provide us with confidence that these products are safe for consumers to use and therefore, our position remains that food containers and utensils containing bamboo composite material should not be sold in GB.\n\n“We don’t know the long-term impacts to health from using these products and we continue to have concerns that chemicals such as formaldehyde and melamine might leak from these materials when they are in contact with food, especially hot or acidic foods.\n\n“Previously, businesses were asked to remove these products from sale and, as a precautionary measure, consumers were advised that they should not use any of these products they had previously purchased until a full investigation into the potential risks had been completed.\n\n“Now this is complete, we are advising consumers who still have these items not to use them for storing or serving food, but to dispose of them in general waste, and for businesses to ensure these products are not made available for sale.\n\n“These products are not compostable and can’t be recycled and so, consumers who still have these items should discard them in the general waste bin or re-use them for non-food purposes.”\n\nIt may be difficult to tell whether a product is made from a bamboo-composite material once it has been removed from its packaging, but products will have a smooth surface and have the feel of plastic.",

De Pree said, “We will be a good corporate neighbor by being a good steward of the environment.” With this in mind, Herman Miller has revisited many of its designs through material innovation over the years, including the Eames Molded Plastic Chairs, now made from 100% recycled plastic, and Aeron Chair, now made with ocean-bound plastic.\n\nThe bamboo-based leather alternative is soft, durable, and more scratch-resistant and colorfast than any other material. It is used in designer handbags and footwear, luxury automotive interiors, and now, as an upholstery option for the iconic Eames Lounge Chair and Ottoman from Herman Miller.\n\nBamboo is deemed one of the world’s most sustainable resources due to its rapid and continual growth, higher CO2 absorption rate, and usage of only one-third of the water required by other natural plants. Upholstering the Eames Lounge Chair and Ottoman in material derived from bamboo helps reduce the materials carbon footprint of the chair by up to 35 percent.\n\nEames Lounge Chair and Ottoman, often referred to by collectors and design enthusiasts by the product codes “670” and “671”, was introduced on national television in 1956 by Charles and Ray Eames and has been in continuous production from Herman Miller since. It set the bar for lounge seating and quickly became a highly visible emblem of Herman Miller’s quality. One of the most significant furniture designs of the 20th century—instantly recognizable in museums, homes, offices, and film sets—the timeless design provides long-lasting comfort through its signature reclined positioning and a shape that flexes to fit individuals. Citing the English club chair as inspiration, Charles said he sought to design a modern version of that chair, one that had “the warm receptive look of a well-used first baseman's mitt.”\n\n“Charles and Ray Eames pioneered the use of molded plywood in furniture, one of the central material innovations of their time. Today, Herman Miller is among the first furniture brands to offer a plant-based leather alternative—made almost entirely from bamboo. The two materials come together in the latest offering of the iconic Eames Lounge Chair and Ottoman, upholding the aesthetic and quality standards that have defined the chair for nearly 70 years,” says Noah Schwarz, Vice President of Product Design for Herman Miller.\n\nThe new bamboo-based upholstery colorways include ivory, russet, and black. Each can be specified with any of the existing shell types—walnut, santos palisander, ash, or oak—and in standard and tall sizes.\n\nEames Lounge and Ottoman with bamboo-based upholstery can be purchased in stores and online at Herman Miller and through Herman Miller and MillerKnoll dealers for contract customers. Visit the Herman Miller website for your region for availability.\n\nAbout Herman Miller\n\nOver the last century, Herman Miller has been guided by a commitment to problem-solving designs that inspire the best in people. Along the way, Herman Miller has forged critical relationships with the most visionary designers of the day, from mid-century greats like George Nelson, the Eames Office, and Isamu Noguchi, to research-oriented visionaries like Robert Propst and Bill Stumpf—and with today's groundbreaking studios like Industrial Facility and Studio 7.5. From the birth of ergonomic furniture to manufacturing some of the twentieth century's most iconic pieces, Herman Miller has pioneered original, timeless design that makes an enduring impact, while building a lasting legacy of design, innovation, and social good. Herman Miller is a part of MillerKnoll, a collective of dynamic brands that comes together to design the world we live in.

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) in the UK has advised against the use of bamboo-composite materials for food-related purposes due to concerns over chemical leaching, particularly formaldehyde and melamine, which can pose health risks [(Food Standards Agency, 2024-06-20)](https://www.food.gov.uk/news-alerts/news/updated-notice-on-plastic-containers-and-utensils-containing-bamboo).\n\n## Opinions and Market Sentiment\nThe perception of bamboo varies significantly across different contexts. In gardening, for instance, bamboo has been labeled as invasive, with homeowners facing significant costs to remove it from their properties. This has led to a growing awareness of the potential risks associated with planting bamboo, akin to the issues posed by Japanese knotweed [(Simon Usborne, The Guardian, 2024-06-11)](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/11/big-british-bamboo-crisis-invaded-my-beautiful-home).\n\nConversely, in the context of sustainability and innovation, bamboo is celebrated for its potential to replace harmful plastics and contribute to eco-friendly practices. The ongoing research into bamboo's role in improving soil and water quality further underscores its ecological importance [(Tim Crosby, SIU, 2024-08-16)](https://news.siu.edu/2024/07/072424-siu-researchers-study-how-giant-cane-bamboo-remnants-affect-ecosystems.php).\n\n## Conclusion\nBamboo Rose is positioned as a leader in retail technology solutions, with recent acquisitions and partnerships enhancing its capabilities. The product bamboo itself is gaining traction as a sustainable alternative to plastics, although it faces challenges related to its application in food safety. As awareness of bamboo's benefits and risks continues to grow, both prospective candidates and investors should consider the evolving landscape of bamboo in various industries. \n\nFor further information, please refer to the sources cited throughout this report."
