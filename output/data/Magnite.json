      "# [Open Bidding FAQ on 2023-09-01](https://www.magnite.com/openbiddingfaq/)\n1. I reviewed the Terms & Conditions and found some language that I was not comfortable agreeing to. Can I propose changes/redlines?\n\nUnfortunately, given the high volume of Google Open Bidding publishers who are participating in this program, Magnite is unable to accommodate any custom changes/redlines to the Terms & Conditions at this time.\n\n2. How long does it normally take Magnite to review my submission?\n\nMagnite is doing its best to expedite the review of each submission and expects the review process to normally take up to three business days. Magnite thanks you for your patience as this new Open Bidding program is rolled out.\n\nIf approved, Magnite will require that you update your Ads.txt/App-Ads.txt file in order to monetize your inventory. It is recommended that you get a head start by inserting the following line item:\n\nrubiconproject.com, 22884, DIRECT, 0bfd66d529a55807\n\nMagnite also recommends that you bookmark the Google OB Terms you consented to by bookmarking the following URL. This will allow you to access these legal terms for future reference.\n\n4. It’s been a week. Will I receive email notification from Magnite once I am approved or rejected?\n\nDue to the high volume of submissions, Magnite will not be able to send you a separate email notification once your inventory starts monetizing. However, your application’s status will appear in your applicable Bidder’s UI interface (Google Ad Manager or Google Admob) as one of three statuses:\n\n“Pending” – your submission is still under review\n\n“Approved” – your submission was approved and monetization should begin soon\n\n“Rejected” – your submission was rejected\n\n5. When I checked my status in my Google Bidder’s UI interface (AdManager or Admob), it shows my status as “rejected.” How can I find out the reasons for the rejection? Is there a way I can appeal the decision?\n\nDue to the high volume of submissions received and Magnite’s focus on reviewing all submissions as quickly as possible, Magnite is unable to provide detailed rejection reasons or offer a path to appeal at this time. To increase your chances of approval, please make sure to provide detailed & accurate information when initially submitting your information.\n\n6. I did not enter any billing information when I submitted my form. How will Magnite provide me performance reporting and know how to pay me?\n\nOne of the value propositions of the Google Open Bidding program is to offer publishers consolidated billing/reporting. Google will be providing you performance reporting and remitting payments directly to you. You will not receive a login to the Magnite platform.\n\n7. What ad formats or sizes does Magnite support?\n\nMagnite supports monetization across a wide variety of ad formats and industry-standard sizes, including desktop web, mobile web, mobile app, and video. Ad formats include, but are not limited to, banners, interstitials, in-stream or outstream, and rewarded video.\n\n8. Which countries is Magnite able to do business with under this program?\n\nIf your inventory becomes approved, and as long as your company is not registered to do business in, nor has its principal place of business located in, any of the countries listed HERE, then you are eligible to work with Magnite.\n\n9. What if I have new domains or app bundles that I wish to monetize with Magnite, but were not included in my original submission? How do I get those approved?\n\nIf you have new inventory that Magnite hasn’t reviewed, please provide your Google Publisher ID and any new domain and/or app bundle details to Magnite’s email alias of OBSupport@magnite.com. If/when it is approved, you can begin sending that inventory to Magnite for monetization.\n\n10. I have ad inventory available for monetization from many different countries. Which countries will Magnite be able to monetize?\n\nThere are some exceptions, but you can expect Magnite to be able to monetize a wide array of ad formats in most major countries around the world.\n\n11. I don’t have my Google Publisher ID readily available. Is that going to be a problem to get approved?\n\nIt is important that you provide your Google Publisher ID when submitting your application to Magnite. If you are having trouble locating your Google Publisher ID, you can click here if you are an Admob publisher and click here if you are a Google Ad Manager publisher for more information. Please also note that if you require additional email support for any reason after your submission, please make sure to include your Google Publisher ID in your email inquiry to expedite a reply from Magnite.\n\n12. I still have additional unanswered questions. Should I email my Google or my Magnite representative?",

I understand the concepts, theoretical and practical, but one thing you can only build with experience is where you rank certain platforms. Most likely, we'll bring someone onto my team for programmatic or go with an agency, but I'd at least like to know what the best DSP platforms for our needs are, as well as which ones to avoid. \n\nWe're mostly looking at advertising on streaming platforms, music and tv/film. \n\nFor context:\n\n\\- We are in health services, specifically urgent care. We also offer primary care and have a line of pediatric care clinics which will likely be the focus of our programmatic advertising (mostly mothers of kids under 11)  \n\\- Main uses will be for platforms like Spotify/Pandora and streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, etc.  \n\\- We have \\~60 locations, mostly in rural areas  \n\\- Budget is fat  \n\\- The head of the department is awesome, mostly because they're me\n\n## Comment ID kgsul3l with +5 score by [(3EsandPaul, Reddit, 2024-01-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1911gd7/best_dsp_for_a_chain_of_urgent_care_clinics_for/kgsul3l/) (in reply to ID 1911gd7):\nBasis or StackAdapt\n\n## Comment ID kgs5gcc with +9 score by [(JimmyTango, Reddit, 2024-01-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1911gd7/best_dsp_for_a_chain_of_urgent_care_clinics_for/kgs5gcc/) (in reply to ID 1911gd7):\nMost major platforms will want a monthly minimum spend, say $50kish per month. Choozle used to be no minimum but I’m not sure what their latest system is. StackAdapt might be worth a look, they play strongly in the local space, not sure how strong their CTV offering is. \n\nNetflix can only be bought via Xandr DSP right now and only as programmatic guarantee.

However, Walmart does not offer this type of service. \n\nWalmart has their own DSP, built on top of the Trade Desk, where you build custom audiences based on past purchases of specific SKUs tied to your brand. You can also create custom audiences of purchasers based on an entire category.  In addition, there are pre-built Persona segments like Busy Families and demo segments that you can tap into. You can also use non-Walmart data segments, and they are tapped into most SSPs, so it truly is a full on DSP\n\nBecause they own their DSP, they are able to see the entire bid stream, which is how they figure out the attribution. They're keep track of everyone that your campaign served an impression to by utilizing some form of anonymized ID,  and if a person then makes a purchase, they will attribute that purchase and revenue to your campaign. This is typically tracked through credit card # and email addresses to create their own proprietary ID graph and tying it back to the anonymized ID in the bid stream. They utilize a 14 day and a 30 day lookback window - anybody who was served an ad but made a purchase outside of these windows will not be attributed. They also have a machine learning product to tie back \"cash paying customers\" to the campaign (which I don't really believe is that accurate and inflates their revenue numbers).\n\nEssentially, a PMP offering wouldn't allow for matching up of users targeted vs users who bought, because the audiences gets ported out of the attribution ecosystem (if that makes any sense). It could technically be done if you sent over the exposure log files from the DSP to the PMP partner in order for them to actually attempt to do anything, but I'm not actually aware of any company who actually does this.\n\nSo to answer your questions:\n\n1. Xandr isn't involved in the situation, apart from maybe their supply that the DSP can tap into.\n\n2. Matching IDs from targeting and tying it back to their own propriety ID graph.\n\n3. PMP isn't possible here, and in the Walmart DSP, they're connecting to supply vendors just like any other DSP and bidding in real time.\n\n### Comment ID lqb496q with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1fvz91i/can_someone_explain_whats_going_on_behind_the/lqb496q/) (in reply to ID lqazwnj):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID lqbfted with +3 score by [(shooin13, Reddit, 2024-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1fvz91i/can_someone_explain_whats_going_on_behind_the/lqbfted/) (in reply to ID lqb496q):\nYou’ve got it right – for accurate in-store attribution, the retailer typically needs to have control over both the buy-side (DSP) and the supply-side (SSP). This allows them to track the full chain of ad impressions and tie them back to purchases, using things like loyalty programs, credit card data, or proprietary ID graphs.\n\nIn a PMP setup, it becomes more challenging to match users and attribute in-store sales because the data often exits the retailer's ecosystem. That kind of attribution is more feasible when the retailer owns or manages both sides, making the integration seamless.\n\nIf the retailer isn’t directly managing both sides, achieving in-store attribution through a PMP would require more complex integrations, such as using exposure log files from the DSP to attempt that matching, but that’s far from a standard practice today.\n\n#### Comment ID lqbdbmm with +2 score by [(workredditaccount555, Reddit, 2024-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1fvz91i/can_someone_explain_whats_going_on_behind_the/lqbdbmm/) (in reply to ID lqb496q):\nAll good.

That allows them to essentially anonymize this ID and send it over vi the PMP for targeting. If the targeted user completes a purchase for the advertisers item, they are able to tie it back to an exposure. \n\nNot sure what the inventory is, but I imagine some of it is on the Walmart site.

It manages Retailer A's ad inventory, facilitates the creation of Private Marketplace (PMP) deals, and integrates with Retailer A's first-party data to enable audience targeting. \n\nWalmart likely uses a combination of methods to link online ad exposure to in-store purchases, such as loyalty programs, email matching, device ID tracking, etc.\n\nThe inventory in the PMP likely comes from a combination of sources. This includes Retailer A's own digital properties, such as their website and mobile app. It may also include inventory from partner networks with which Walmart has established agreements. Additionally, Walmart might secure some inventory through programmatic guaranteed deals with various publishers, which they then include in the PMP offering. Rather than pre-purchasing inventory to resell, Walmart is more likely curating a package of their own and partner inventory, making this bundle available to selected advertisers through the PMP. This approach allows Walmart to offer a diverse range of ad placements while maintaining control over who can access this premium inventory.\n\n## Comment ID lqe18es with +1 score by [(zeplin_fps, Reddit, 2024-10-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1fvz91i/can_someone_explain_whats_going_on_behind_the/lqe18es/) (in reply to ID 1fvz91i):\nI’m wondering if OP actually meant Walmart DSP.

All good then, haha\n\n\nIm going to use different examples to mitigate confusion. \n\nYou = programmatic trader for Burger King,\nDSP = DV360,\nSSP = Magnite\n\n\nBurger King collects data. Commonly a collection of cookie IDs of people they think are interested in Burger King. This data is pushed to DV360. You can now apply it as an audience in DV360 to only target these people. \n\nAt this point, you have an audience, but no *inventory*. \n\nSo, you reach out to Magnite. You tell them about the campaign and say you want a PMP of food-related inventory. Magnite, who owns inventory across many many sites, curates a list for you and builds a deal in their platform. \n\nSince this is a private marketplace deal, they only want Burger King to use it. Rather than pushing it so everyone on DV360 can use it, they push it to the Burger King seat in DV360. To do this, they need the seat ID from you. \n\nOnce pushed, they’ll give you the deal ID. You can now accept the deal using this ID in DV360. Once accepted, you can apply it to the campaign.\n\nIf you didn’t need a curated PMP or a preferred rate, you could just use the existing inventory in DV360, no need to reach out to Magnite. You could then apply a site list to curate the inventory yourself. \n\n\nNow you activate the campaign. The DSP keeps the bid request data for all impressions served. Maybe it’s the device ID, maybe IP, email. The information isn’t important. The fact is, data for each user served is stored. \n\nNow, Burger King collects data as well. Maybe they are tracking the IPs of users that connect to their WiFi. Maybe they are tracking people within a certain radius of their stores. Maybe they are getting device info tied to credit card transactions. There are many methods, but if this data can be tied back to the impression data in DV360, a conversion is attributed to the campaign.\n\nOffline measurement is tough and far from perfect. There are offline measurement partners such as Inmarket or Foursquare that make it easier. They can help with the attribution process. They can also measure foot traffic of a particular store to measure lift as well. \n\n\n\nI think a big part is your confusion of terms. PMP is a private marketplace deal. This is inventory. Sites, apps, streaming services, etc. Audiences are digital “pools” of users, commonly cookie IDs. \n\nAudience = People,\nDeal/PMP = Inventory\n\nInventory is of course mandatory. You need to buy as space in order to deliver an impression. Audiences are optional. They are just used as a way to slim down the targeting in order to reach more focused users.\n\n## Comment ID lqf6aga with +1 score by [(BidTheory, Reddit, 2024-10-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1fvz91i/can_someone_explain_whats_going_on_behind_the/lqf6aga/) (in reply to ID 1fvz91i):\nThat specific PMP traffic and audience represents a very small part of the total bidstream available in the market. Xandr has a role making sure their pre-targeting sends as much traffic (bid requests) as possible for that specific traffic so you can bid on it. Normally the SSP should give priority to PMP traffic versus general open market traffic to make sure the DSP gets as much of it as possible.\n\nIt doesn’t make sense for DSPs (or SSPs) to exchange traffic none of the DSPs campaigns are bidding for or buying. A running PMP likely has an active buyer in the DSP and therefore the SSP (Xandr) should make sure as much of that as possible gets through so you can buy it.",

Some agencies are better at retaining folks in account transitions, but others arent so that depends on where you work at. \n\nAlso the other downside of being at a client is the company is constantly putting more and more workload on you for the same pay, as they try to manage profitability for wall Street.\n\n## Comment ID iiohgtw with +1 score by [(maddog2047, Reddit, 2022-08-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/wecmof/programmatic_career_path/iiohgtw/) (in reply to ID wecmof):\nClient side is most definitely not ‘chill’ - different set of pressures, but if you have the appetite you can get invaluable exposure to non media colleagues who can accelerate your development\n\n## Comment ID iir32y7 with +1 score by [(DeCyantist, Reddit, 2022-08-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/wecmof/programmatic_career_path/iir32y7/) (in reply to ID wecmof):\nWorking client side is real business pressure rather than client pressure.

Comfort comes a bit later. Main thing an Indian sees when buying a car is cost to ROI ratio. How much are they getting per lakh spent. A brand like Kia has penetrated the tier 2 and tier 3 city as well. Why? The same ratio mentioned above. In order to win India, you have to penetrate these tier 2 and 3 cities. \n\nCitreon is a foreign brand. It will take time for people to trust the brand. It all depends on the marketing and more importantly the products. My and my team had a look at your YouTube and Instagram page and came to a conclusion that Citroen India is doing nothing different when it comes to advertising and marketing content than any other car brand. If you want to win in India, here are a few things that can help you with marketing and advertising...\n\n* Build a community.  \nSomething similar to what OnePlus did during its inception. Or what Ultraviolette is doing now. As per your current brand image, your target demographics is new-generation India living in metropolitan cities. People between the age of 25-45. Atleast that's what it looks like from your TV and digital content. If you want to spend little money, this is the way to go. Build a community of loyal owners and talk to them about their experiences. Not only that but also feature them in your content (I did see some client testimonials on YouTube) Understand what they like and more importantly what they dont like and what improvement would they like to see in the next generation models. This will help in a couple of ways, when viewers see non-advertising faces on the screen, they understand that the brand is actually listening to the owners and proactively working on delivering the best products. Make Citroen feel like a customer friendly company. this might also help with after-sales service image that many brands are infamous for (looking at you Tata).\n* Change your overall brand image slightly to cater to a wider audience.  \nHaving young faces in your ad looks cool but is nothing different than what other brand ads looks like. Nobody looks at the space in the car and say, 'Happy place' (like in one of your ads) It's cringe after a point. Let's be more realistic and ad real life scenarios without being so tacky and flashy with all sorts of colours. Think about why would a random 45-ish uncle from a village of Gujarat or down south would buy a Citroen. Cater to them as well! Practical scenarios. Create a campaign umbrella under which all the USP's of a product are covered through various real-life situations. Keep it simple.\n* Go over and above a car.  \nThis is about your digital content. Talk about things like road-safety, basic etiquettes like land discipline, using low beam at night etc. Use memes. They are so relatable to your regular audience! Dude, why is your Instagram grid so scattered?! There is no dominant colour throughout the grid. Photos are so random with heavy text on them. There is no brand language that I could recognize. Honestly, it's hap-hazard. Let's start with that first. Make it streamline and organized. Next, look at international counterparts like Lucid or Polestar. Create content that shows the people behind the brand like its engineers, designers and CEO's. Know what the thought process was behind a particular product. When viewers see the people behind the brand talking passionately about their products and the thought process behind them, it makes them trust the brand more.  \nReference: [https://youtu.be/-iU1af5heTc](https://youtu.be/-iU1af5heTc)  \n[https://youtu.be/3wkYSPtoN5E](https://youtu.be/3wkYSPtoN5E)  \nThere is so much you can do on digital than you cant do on TV.  Any piece of content that gets uploaded, be it a photo or video needs to be meaningful. Right from product launches to feature list, thoughts behind the products, talking to executives, tour of the facility, customer testimonials etc. Hell, you can even start a weekly podcast with your India CEO, Design head etc. talking about various thing that a car goes through. Right from an idea to its production version.\n\nThis is what comes to my mind by only going through your social media. Do remember, marketing and advertising can only do so much if the products aren't great. Metaverse is a good example.  \n\n\nLet me know if this helps!\n\n## Comment ID jlxh5pl with +10 score by [(CM_gogo, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/13tu9fs/thoughts_on_citroën_in_india_and_what_can_they_do/jlxh5pl/) (in reply to ID 13tu9fs):\n> \"Biggest challenge we're facing is people not buying the car\"\n\nThis honestly feels like such an amateurish statement. This is the end result and not the core flaw in my opinion as an outsider. The basic marketing funnel goes awareness > interest > consideration > intent > evaluation > purchase. Are you seriously telling me that only the last step is the problem and not any of the earlier ones?\n\nI have so many friends making a car purchase who're not aware even of Citroen or have just heard it in passing and aren't seriously considering it.\n\nFrom what I can see, Citroen tried launching the C5 as a premium model to establish an aspirational brand and failed (just like Fluence, X-Trail, Teana, Rexton, and others) and decided to all of a sudden pivot to the other end of the market with a super-affordable hatchback. Such a product needs volumes which you don't have the dealerships and service network to support. This is also confusing for a consumer as to what does this brand specialise in. The launch of the C3 too was very lacklustre with loads of missing features. A new variant is launched recently but you've missed the bus. Should've come out all guns blazing.\n\nTake the example of Kia which launched a product at the right price point (not too expensive like C5 or too cheap like the C3), equipped it to the gills, added multiple engine + gearbox + fuel + variant options (to the point that it became a bit too much) and marketed it with one of the leading Bollywood celebs.\n\n## Comment ID jlx6vbo with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/13tu9fs/thoughts_on_citroën_in_india_and_what_can_they_do/jlx6vbo/) (in reply to ID 13tu9fs):\nMore showrooms and service centres, better customer reach-out with more cars and better advertisement, improving amenities provided in cars and targeting right segments C5 Aircross is not the product that will make majority of sales.

Whoever decided the feature list hasnt been following the market lately.\n\n## Comment ID jlxg9u7 with +9 score by [(TheManFromUnkill, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/13tu9fs/thoughts_on_citroën_in_india_and_what_can_they_do/jlxg9u7/) (in reply to ID 13tu9fs):\nHow did Sebastian Loeb beat every other car maker in a Citroen for more than a decade ? \nWhy is the Citroen DS a masterpiece ? \n\nInnovation , easy to repair , easy to live with, reliable , consistent ?\n\nWhat is the USP ? \n\nWhy not have a rally type service on wheels where you don’t need an authorized stealership workshop in every village ?

Brand awareness. (a) assure the masses you are here to stay, the best way to do so is not marketing but investment. And then publicize those investments. (b) Use the reliability of an individual by hiring him as your brand ambassador. (c) Hiring, nothing says commitment by a company when they invest in Human Resources, more jobs will associate more people with the brand, it is along term game.\n\n2. Products need to be differentiated, invest in cosmetics, use the underlying platform for all, but things people see and interact with, needs to be differentiated. Don't be like TATA, Maruti.\n\n3. Awareness about the brand and it's heritage. This is the third attempt by the brand to enter Indian market. Many of us remember the cars and the troubles. Need to ensure you are not just testing waters but playing the long term game. The Birla Group need to shoulder that responsibility too, Citroën cannot do it alone.\n\nThese are just rough outlines, define the fine-grained strategy, and be aggressive.\n\nJust my two cents.

What I mean by good is that its a really peppy car. Its so responsive, it just takes off. You don’t get performance like that at this price point. \nIts not claustrophobic inside either, like how the baleno and other cars of this dimension are. \nIts build quality is also pretty good, it feels solid.\nThe looks of the C3 are aesthetically pleasing, so thats always nice.\nIt has good ground clearance. Again better than its rivals. Its gives peace of mind on broken uneven roads.\nThe tyres on this car, in the shine turbo variant, are broader than that of its competitors. It makes it stable on the highway at high speeds. Also because its slightly broad and less in overall height - it adds to its stability. \n\nYou should make a video of this car being driven around in the hills, because its engine is powerful enough to drive on steep climbs, like in Missouri, or Manali, especially during traffic. Show how great its clutch, hand break, and climbing ability is on an uphill climb during a traffic jam. \nAlso its great on bad roads, you don’t really feel the bumps at all. \nAnd its so stable on the highway at high speeds. The really nice thing about this car is that its just a pleasure to drive. \nAnd that is its selling point. Its a drivers car. \nIts ergonomic, so its comfortable, its fun.\nYou can drive hours and not get a back ache or a neck ache.\n\nThe C3 is also more mechanical a car than electronic. \nI drove a mahindra xuv 300 in the hills one time, and in traffic because of a clutch misfire it switched off, and the steering got locked and the breaks wouldn’t work and I was on an incline and that was very scary because I could have just hit the car in front because it started to slip forward. I managed to restart the car fast enough but this is a huge problem in cars now days because they are more electric than mechanic and if they switch off everything gets locked and restarting the car is a while process.\nIn older cars you never faced such an issue, so that just made them safer. \n\nHaving less electronic parts also is more affordable to maintain in the long run. Its real competitors are wagon r and i10. \nIn features, which everyone loves, it is lacking. The price its being sold at is not at par with the features offered. That is the main reason no is going for this car. \nSo the only thing to do is highlight its standout features, which I have listed on top. No other car in this category and one above it has a peppy engine like the C3 has. \nIt needs heavy advertising, because no one will know otherwise. Also the servicing needs to highlighted. The lack of service centres is a drawback.\n\nSo yeah, get it reviewed more by some popular car youtubers.\nSecondly, make some great adverts like a road trip from delhi to manali, show it being driven around and highlight its good points. Because where its good, its really good.",

Kia is sitting there with Sonet which has the interior quality from two segments above, but Kiger is there with rattly plastic. Your average 10L spending customer is no longer interested in products that feels cheaper and hence why you see Nissan do the sensible thing and improve the interior of the Magnite even if they haven't made any substantial change.\n\nAs an example, when I was buying a small hatch, I actually looked at amaze, it's a very superior car for my purpose. But, I couldn't sell it to my family because of the lacklustre Honda sales reception, the bare-bones interiors, colour choices and to a large extent a dull test ride. What I am noticing obviously is as people's quality of life and financial potential improves, they are looking for good presentation, especially when they are shelling out on big products.\n\nAll the things said above magnifies dramatically once they look at a product line from Hyundai, Kia and even Tata and Mahindra in this price range. You can Kiger is a solid 1L or 2L cheaper, but when people look at Venue they will check out the i20 and even the bottom segment i10 grand nios. It all feels very premium and well put together, and not like they are being sold something cheap with compromises. When you go to the Tata or Mahindra, your family will check out the XUV 700 and Harriers. They would rather buy something that's a segment below from a brand that offers Harrier than a showroom that's sitting there with one car that doesn't feel as premium.\n\nSo, they have to bring the products quality to at least the old Duster level to survive in the market, then the service and sales experience factors in.\n\n### Comment ID lshx9rn with +3 score by [(sid3091, Reddit, 2024-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lshx9rn/) (in reply to ID lsbnsqh):\n> Your average 10L spending customer is no longer interested in products that feels\n\nYou're not getting a sonet at 10 lacs, my guy.

In fact, if I'm spending on one as a beater next, I would buy the second to base trim since it has the important two things I look for in a car, a decent infotainment system and rear camera. It also comes kitted with front parking sensor and auto headlamps; hence why you see a lot of people buying the HTK and HTK+. And the important part is they don't feel like a downgraded version in terms of trim quality, and you can be confident they won't start rattling after a few years.\n\nBut what I meant by 10L spending customer is just people who are ready to spend past 10L and go up to 15L.\n\n## Comment ID lsbt0xv with +8 score by [(WhyAmIHere0025, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lsbt0xv/) (in reply to ID 1g5jgwc):\nTbf, a lot of good cars don’t do well in India, our market has requirements that most people abroad do not care about much, ‘kitna deti hai?’, sunroofs etc.\nEfficiency obviously makes sense since most people here aren’t exactly that rich, and for a lot of people owning a car is an aspiration or a dream, so obviously they want all the gimmicks like a sunroof and electronics, which is why Hyundais and KIAs sell so well (they are decent cars as well no denying that), so simply getting all the basics right doesn’t sell enough, a brand needs some kind of USP for word of mouth, Honda offers brand value die to the historical image of the city, the Germans offer driving dynamics, suzuki offers mileage and reliability etc, and the former two still aren’t doing well here, now imagine how would you explain to a neighbour with no knowledge of cars about why they should get a Renault in today’s time?\n\n## Comment ID lsbsbok with +20 score by [(amanbindra94, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lsbsbok/) (in reply to ID 1g5jgwc):\nI own a CVT turbo Kiger and can vouch that it's the most VFM product in the market at that price band.

The non turbo engine sucks and the turbo one is just satisfactory, especially in the AMTs and many city drivers are going towards automatics even at low price points.\n\n2. India has also seen a shift where many people have started at least thinking of Safety in their top 5 requirements. \n\n3. Also Renault has always been seen as a budget brand because their only car that did respectable numbers after the duster is the Kwid. Renault’s fault for not bringing updated Duster in time to take advantage of the booming SUV market despite the fact that Duster could be considered one of the cars that popularised SUVs in city households. \n\n4. The consumer in that price bracket is more concerned with Fuel Efficiency (Maruti’s strength) than with Ride Comfort (Renault’s only redeeming feature) and since neither offers the better safety they go with Maruti/Hyundai.\n\n### Comment ID lsbt5p5 with +10 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lsbt5p5/) (in reply to ID lsbpzvz):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID lshxork with +2 score by [(sid3091, Reddit, 2024-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lshxork/) (in reply to ID lsbt5p5):\n> 3 more bhp at 17 lakhs on road\n\nAnd 20NM less torque :P\n\n## Comment ID lscjmvz with +3 score by [(HistoricalSeason432, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lscjmvz/) (in reply to ID 1g5jgwc):\nKiger and Magnite( turbo variants) are Punch/Altroz/Exter/Baleno rivals.

Current anti-trust case law often depends on showing a harm to someone (usually the consumer). With search by itself, it's hard to show any 'harm' even if it was monopolistic. You can actually very plausibly argue the opposite- by being monopolistic, google has better data to give better results.\n\nIt's much easier to do so with ads (monopoly means Google has leverage for higher ad prices). You can see this thinking in the release:\n\n*To redress Google’s anticompetitive conduct, the Department seeks both equitable relief on behalf of the American public as well as treble damages for losses sustained by federal government agencies that overpaid for web display advertising.*\n\nThere was also the swap from Trump's DOJ, to Biden. There is likely some difference in thinking between the two. In particular, Biden's nominees have been much more interested in antitrust/monopoly laws than past DOJs (including Dem ones). They've been much more aggressive.\n\n>because they survived the last one?\n\nThe 2020 case hasn't actually been litigated yet, it's set for 2023.\n\n*The Google search litigation is scheduled for trial in September 2023.*\n\n### Comment ID j6dt3gf with +142 score by [(lyzabth, Reddit, 2023-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/10o9fgj/whats_up_with_doj_suing_google_again/j6dt3gf/) (in reply to ID j6ds4ep):\nAnswered!

In fact, they seemed to err on the most reasonable specifically for this reason.\n\nIn addition, nowadays everything is based around Real-Time Bidding (RTB) and it’s generally on the advertiser themselves (not the platform) to control their bid and spend limits.\n\nSo Google is very clearly not using their “monopoly” to undercut competition, fleece advertisers nor do they have near the ubiquity as an ad platform as they do in search (Facebook, Apple, Magnite and the hundreds of other smaller adtech platforms make up a significant chunk of the advertising space; even being far larger than Google in many niche spaces). So I would argue this is a much *less* likely case than their search monopoly.\n\n### Comment ID j6e2sja with +51 score by [(Sarothu, Reddit, 2023-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/10o9fgj/whats_up_with_doj_suing_google_again/j6e2sja/) (in reply to ID j6ds4ep):\nUh...

Enforcement of laws by your Department of Justice is dependant on which administration is currently in charge?\n\nIn theory, no. In practice, yes.\n\n(Again, in theory), it's not supposed to change that much. So they won't like, drop a case that was previously filed. There's supposed to be a respect between different administrations, and a lot of employees are lifetime so they work under different admins. The courts also put some restrictions. They don't let DOJ whiplash from making argument A to making argument not-A.\n\nBut even in the ideal case leaving partisan politics aside, when you have a different people in charge, they're going to have at least slightly different interpretations of the law. There are going to be cases where one person might not pursue a case, or they're willing to settle, etc. There is room for discretion.\n\n\nIt's not *quite* as bad as it sounds, but yes, it's a problem. The system assumes a lot of good faith. And there isn't a whole let of checks and balances on DOJ's discretion. If they choose to not file a charge, there isn't really anything anyone can do about it short of big stuff like impeachment.\n\n>That seems like madness, especially given that these cases tend to take years and the administration in charge changes so rapidly?\n\nIt's kind of unavoidable, especially in our system, since every agency operates under the Executive Branch. Our Founding Fathers only created 3 branches of government. We've put up some kludges, but fundamentally there is no such thing as an independent agency, everything operates as one of those branches. (And even 'independent' agencies still tend to have some nonzero politics). So we're more susceptible to it\n\nThat said, for what it's worth, it almost certainly works similarly in most countries. The difference is that presumption of good faith isn't as obviously stretched. But that sort of discretion is kind of inherent in enforcing the law. There will always be cases that are borderline, or whatever, or certain cases that get prioritized\n\n#### Comment ID j6e9p2v with +11 score by [(__crackers__, Reddit, 2023-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/10o9fgj/whats_up_with_doj_suing_google_again/j6e9p2v/) (in reply to ID j6e2sja):\nIt's the same everywhere. \n\nThey don't just have a naughty list, they have to do a proper investigation first.

That seems like madness\n\nIt's more like there are limited resources to prosecute things and in theory, different Attorneys General could reasonably disagree with which enforcement actions are worth taking when given the choice between two.\n\nPart of this is going to be because things like antitrust suits aren't guaranteed wins and require both an assessment of the risk/rewards as well as sometimes novel legal theories (antitrust law for instance is an area of law where legal thinking has changed drastically over time).\n\nA great example of this would be whether the DOJ should pursue a case against Apple on antitrust grounds for its app stores. Epic Games lost that lawsuit, but could the DOJ therefore win? *What* exactly is the appropriate market? Apple clearly has a monopoly on apps used by Apple users but doesn't have a monopoly on apps used by all smartphone users. \n\nThis is all to say that I can easily see a case where political appointees to positions in the DOJ (which the ssistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division is) might reasonably disagree over whether to bring an action or not.\n\n#### Comment ID j6f8all with +2 score by [(chicagotim1, Reddit, 2023-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/10o9fgj/whats_up_with_doj_suing_google_again/j6f8all/) (in reply to ID j6e2sja):\nThe enforcement of WHICH of thousands of potential cases to focus on and what to prioritize.

We still have other search engines\n\nAntitrust doesn't apply to just literal monopolies (which is literally just 1 company), but also ones with every large market share, like oligopolies.\n\nThere is a pretty good argument that the market is too concentrated, yes. While there are alternatives, Google is by far the major player\n\nGoogle is something like ~30% of overall ad market share (with Facebook at ~24%, and Amazon at ~12%). That isn't quite monopoly status, but it's well into antitrust/oligopoly status. It's huge.\n\n(It's market share of search is even higher, at ~92%)\n\nPart of Google's argument is definitely going to be that there are other search engines, so people aren't locked in. Not sure how it will turn out, anti-trust law is kinda complicated. But as I mentioned above, usually the standard is harm to consumers. You can have competitors but still be so large it's detrimental to consumers.\n\n### Comment ID j6ehzjb with +9 score by [(ronearc, Reddit, 2023-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/10o9fgj/whats_up_with_doj_suing_google_again/j6ehzjb/) (in reply to ID j6ds4ep):\nThe timing of Microsoft sinking $10B into ChatGPT may be enough for Google to convince the courts that they don't have a monopoly; they just had a temporary technological advantage which is already being challenged by emerging technologies.\n\n#### Comment ID j6ewdxz with +10 score by [(Needs_More_Nuance, Reddit, 2023-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/10o9fgj/whats_up_with_doj_suing_google_again/j6ewdxz/) (in reply to ID j6ehzjb):\nIt's more about anticompetitive practices\n\n#### Comment ID j6fagps with +8 score by [(notjordansime, Reddit, 2023-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/10o9fgj/whats_up_with_doj_suing_google_again/j6fagps/) (in reply to ID j6ehzjb):\nThat's apples to oranges though.

          "cons": "Magnite pay is well below industry standard. I was told by HR when leaving the company that Magnite does not want to be known as a top paying company. This leads mid/junior employees to have higher turnover rates than expected.\n\nA lot of teams are very top-heavy, which leaves no room or possibility for others to get promoted. I was at Magnite for over 5 years, and we never once did a proper year end, employee evaluation. At other companies, you typically do your evaluation with your manager in December, who then provides feedback on how to grow in your career. Where you stand in terms of performance should not be a surprise, but at Magnite it is. When January comes around, random people get promoted, and your manager will just look at you shrug and say there wasn't enough budget for anyone else to get promoted. Given promotions only happen once a year, this is an extremely upsetting situation to be in, and is the exact reason why many people leave the company. \n\nEach team's RTO is different. Understandably, RTO is the new normal, but then everyone should be held to the same standard. There are engineers that need to be in the office 3x a week, but then several SALES people are allowed to work completely remote? People who lead large teams are completely remote? The company needs a more fair stance. It seems only senior level people at the company got permission to be remote, while everyone else is held to a different standard.",

C-level management was either incompetent or so out of touch they end up being incompetent, I couldn't tell. Middle management is a bunch of yes-men (men, no women) who aggressively play the \"just go with it even though it's a bad plan, it will get fixed eventually\" card and as far as I can tell they are all highly loaded with stock and just playing a waiting game to dump it all as soon as it vests.. I can't blame them there. Day to day is a slew of overstaffed meetings that should have been (or already were) tracked issues and don't really accomplish anything with some spurts of work thrown in. At SpotX I would be able to get about 20-25 hours per 40hr week of active work completed and Magnite I was peaking in the mid to low teens. It seems from my view that every piece of infrastructure is set up by only skimming documentation and then getting it to a place at which it just barely functions then moving on and never ever coming back to get it out of alpha stage. Bugs become features, duct tape becomes structural and all that. Honestly I have never seen a more toxic work environment. The back to office mandate that all but management follows was a cherry. I loved spotx because of the teams and attitude of all trying to push in the same direction and we all tried that at magnite when we got acquired.. and got promptly thrown under every bus they could find. I'm glad I got a package, others were not so lucky. Beware of the politics in middle management, some of them can lie very well, and pay attention to who is the one pulling their strings. Check the companies cycle of funding, quarterly reports and then immediate stock dumps by all employees.",

C-level management was either incompetent or so out of touch they end up being incompetent, I couldn't tell. Middle management is a bunch of yes-men (men, no women) who aggressively play the \"just go with it even though it's a bad plan, it will get fixed eventually\" card and as far as I can tell they are all highly loaded with stock and just playing a waiting game to dump it all as soon as it vests.. I can't blame them there. Day to day is a slew of overstaffed meetings that should have been (or already were) tracked issues and don't really accomplish anything with some spurts of work thrown in. At SpotX I would be able to get about 20-25 hours per 40hr week of active work completed and Magnite I was peaking in the mid to low teens. It seems from my view that every piece of infrastructure is set up by only skimming documentation and then getting it to a place at which it just barely functions then moving on and never ever coming back to get it out of alpha stage. Bugs become features, duct tape becomes structural and all that. Honestly I have never seen a more toxic work environment. The back to office mandate that all but management follows was a cherry. I loved spotx because of the teams and attitude of all trying to push in the same direction and we all tried that at magnite when we got acquired.. and got promptly thrown under every bus they could find. I'm glad I got a package, others were not so lucky. Beware of the politics in middle management, some of them can lie very well, and pay attention to who is the one pulling their strings. Check the companies cycle of funding, quarterly reports and then immediate stock dumps by all employees.",

This leads mid/junior employees to have higher turnover rates than expected.\n\nA lot of teams are very top-heavy, which leaves no room or possibility for others to get promoted. I was at Magnite for over 5 years, and we never once did a proper year end, employee evaluation. At other companies, you typically do your evaluation with your manager in December, who then provides feedback on how to grow in your career. Where you stand in terms of performance should not be a surprise, but at Magnite it is. When January comes around, random people get promoted, and your manager will just look at you shrug and say there wasn't enough budget for anyone else to get promoted. Given promotions only happen once a year, this is an extremely upsetting situation to be in, and is the exact reason why many people leave the company. \n\nEach team's RTO is different. Understandably, RTO is the new normal, but then everyone should be held to the same standard. There are engineers that need to be in the office 3x a week, but then several SALES people are allowed to work completely remote? People who lead large teams are completely remote? The company needs a more fair stance. It seems only senior level people at the company got permission to be remote, while everyone else is held to a different standard.",

      "# [TargetSmart Announces Exclusive Partnership with Magnite to Enable Turn Key Data-Driven Political Advertising Across CTV Inventory by KarYi Lim on 2024-08-15](https://www.magnite.com/press/targetsmart-announces-exclusive-partnership-with-magnite-to-enable-turn-key-data-driven-political-advertising-across-ctv-inventory/)\nDemocratic campaigns, agencies, and causes can utilize TargetSmart data at scale across premium content\n\nWASHINGTON DC – August 15, 2024 – TargetSmart, the leading provider of political data for Democratic campaigns and advocacy organizations, announced an exclusive partnership with Magnite (NASDAQ: MGNI), the largest independent sell-side advertising company. This collaboration, supported by Magnite’s integration with Snowflake AI Data Cloud for Media, enables Democratic campaigns, agencies, and causes to immediately activate campaigns using TargetSmart data across Magnite’s expansive CTV footprint on any demand side platform.\n\n”We’ve all seen in the last few weeks how campaigns need to be nimble and ready to pivot on a dime to communicate with their target audience. This partnership puts Democratic buyers in the driver’s seat and offers them a streamlined way to execute and optimize their political campaigns,” said TargetSmart CEO Lindsey Schuh Cortes. “Magnite’s scale and direct relationships with publishers bring campaigns and causes closer to the inventory they want to advertise across. We expect the benefits of this closer access to result in higher match rates and faster deal set up resulting in reaching more voters at the speed that political advertising requires.”\n\nMagnite is the world’s largest independent sell-side advertising company and helps media owners monetize their content across all screens and formats including streaming TV, online video, display, and audio.

      "# [Inside the Magnite C-Suite with Chief Product Officer Adam Soroca by Mariah Cooper on 2024-08-26](https://www.magnite.com/blog/inside-the-magnite-c-suite-with-chief-product-officer-adam-soroca/)\nIn this Q+A, we sit down with Chief Product Officer Adam Soroca to get a behind-the-scenes look at product development at Magnite, his insights on the future of ad tech, and what keeps him motivated and excited about the industry.\n\nMagnite’s C-Suite series provides a unique opportunity to gain firsthand perspectives on critical industry trends and strategic initiatives shaping Magnite’s core values and future.\n\nWhat are you most passionate about in your role as chief product officer at Magnite? What drives your product vision and innovation strategy?\n\nSo, this answer has two dimensions: the work we do and the team we get to work alongside. One is Magnite’s role and the scale at which we operate. Magnite has incredible scale across all the leading media formats. Our ability to connect buyers with sellers’ inventory and influence consumers is immense. It’s a real privilege and an honor to build and innovate on this stage.\n\nI enjoy the mix of creativity and problem-solving. I like to sit at the dreaming level and think about things that don’t exist and the detailed technology needed to make them work. We often flip-flop between those two categories before merging them together.\n\nOur approach is a constant mix of “What does the market say? What do our clients say that they think they need? What do they not say that you have to interpret?” From there, our vision unfolds. Sometimes, these are linear, incremental innovations. And sometimes, these things are brand new and bring something to the market that hasn’t been asked for. Some of the most interesting things come from that because you show up with something, and clients say, “I didn’t even know I needed that.” You have to convince the market and help the market evolve in a certain way.\n\nThe other part of my role that motivates me is building the team and developing not just a product team but a cross-functional team to innovate, think differently, and bring these products to market.\n\nMagnite operates in a rapidly evolving landscape. How do you approach product development to ensure Magnite stays ahead of the curve?\n\nThat is the delicate art and dance that we have to do. It’s a constant balance of doing what is requested by clients specifically and pushing forward things on our own that we believe the industry needs. There’s really no perfect science to it. You have to be able to say “no” to a lot. In product management, we say “no” or more like “no, not this quarter” way more often than we say “yes.”\n\nWith so many stakeholders in ad tech (advertisers, publishers), how do you balance their needs when prioritizing product features?\n\nWe balance the portfolio and allocate our resources towards our different product lines, dedicating percentages of our product and engineering resources to work on each. That rebalancing happens at the executive leadership team level. However, once that allocation is set within the product lines, those product managers and engineering leaders are free to prioritize however they see appropriate. As a company, we first build heavier on the ad server and publisher side. We balance that out with products that benefit our marketers, whether it’s for the brands, the agencies, or the DSPs so that they can buy our inventory fairly, transparently, and advantageously.\n\nWhat exciting product innovations are currently in the pipeline at Magnite? Can you give us a sneak peek?\n\nWe’re excited about a lot of things coming to market. We are working on a single sign-on and universal navigation between Magnite Streaming and SpringServe for a seamless user experience. We want our publisher clients who use both products to feel like it’s one product. We also are building out our identity suite and scaling it to suit the needs of our clients. Curated Marketplaces is on track to add targeting and features to DV+ and add capabilities to our self-service workflow for streaming inventory.\n\nWe have advanced forecasting that’s hitting the market. We’re also looking into new investments, specifically in live television, and expanding upon our initial success with Tiles into other formats. This is innovation and the redefinition of the advertising experience for connected television.\n\nNow for something fun! Tell us about the first concert you ever attended.\n\nRolling Stones at Shea Stadium. Living Colour opened up for that. It was a great concert with a bunch of my friends from high school, and we had a blast!",

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as \"may,\" \"might,\" \"will,\" \"objective,\" \"intend,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"can,\" \"would,\" \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"design,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" \"plan\" or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the Company’s guidance or expectations with respect to future financial performance; acquisitions by the Company, or the anticipated benefits thereof; potential synergies from the Company's acquisitions; macroeconomic conditions or concerns related thereto; the growth of ad-supported programmatic connected television (\"CTV\"); our ability to use and collect data to provide our offerings; scope and duration of client relationships; the fees we may charge in the future; our anticipated financial performance; key strategic objectives; anticipated benefits of new offerings; business mix; sales growth; benefits from supply path optimization; the development of identity solutions; client utilization of our offerings; our competitive differentiation; our market share and leadership position in the industry; market conditions, trends, and opportunities; certain statements regarding future operational performance measures; and other statements that are not historical facts. These statements are not guarantees of future performance; they reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and estimates and subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from expectations or results projected or implied by forward-looking statements.\n\nWe discuss many of these risks and additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by our forward-looking statements under the headings \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" and elsewhere in this press release and in other filings we have made and will make from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of the report in which they are included. Unless required by federal securities laws, we assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated, to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the statements are made. Without limiting the foregoing, any guidance we may provide will generally be given only in connection with quarterly and annual earnings announcements, without interim updates, and we may appear at industry conferences or make other public statements without disclosing material nonpublic information in our possession. Given these uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Investors should read this press release and the documents that we reference in this press release and have filed or will file with the SEC completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Operational Measures:\n\nIn addition to our GAAP results, we review certain non-GAAP financial measures to help us evaluate our business on a consistent basis, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of investments in our technology and development and sales and marketing, and assess our operational efficiencies. These non-GAAP measures include Contribution ex-TAC, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Income (Loss), and Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) per share, each of which is discussed below.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, or as superior to, the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments, and review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP measures, and the reasons we consider them appropriate. It is important to note that the particular items we exclude from, or include in, our non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the items excluded from, or included in, similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. See \"Reconciliation of Revenue to Gross Profit to Contribution ex-TAC,\" \"Reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA,\" \"Reconciliation of net loss to non-GAAP income,\" and \"Reconciliation of GAAP loss per share to non-GAAP earnings per share\" included as part of this press release.\n\nWe do not provide a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial expectations for Contribution ex-TAC and Adjusted EBITDA, or a forecast of the most comparable GAAP measures, because the amount and timing of many future charges that impact these measures (such as amortization of future acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related charges, foreign exchange (gain) loss, net, stock-based compensation, impairment charges, provision or benefit for income taxes, and our future revenue mix), which could be material, are variable, uncertain, or out of our control and therefore cannot be reasonably predicted without unreasonable effort, if at all. In addition, we believe such reconciliations or forecasts could imply a degree of precision that might be confusing or misleading to investors.\n\nContribution ex-TAC:\n\nContribution ex-TAC is calculated as gross profit plus cost of revenue, excluding traffic acquisition cost (\"TAC\"). Traffic acquisition cost, a component of cost of revenue, represents what we must pay sellers for the sale of advertising inventory through our platform for revenue reported on a gross basis. Contribution ex-TAC is a non-GAAP financial measure that is most comparable to gross profit. We believe Contribution ex-TAC is a useful measure in assessing the performance of Magnite and facilitates a consistent comparison against our core business without considering the impact of traffic acquisition costs related to revenue reported on a gross basis.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA:\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment charges, interest income or expense, and other cash and non-cash based income or expenses that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance, including, but not limited to foreign exchange gains and losses, acquisition and related items, gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, other debt refinancing expenses, non-operational real estate and other expenses (income), net, and provision (benefit) for income taxes. We also track future expenses on an Adjusted EBITDA basis, and describe them as Adjusted EBITDA operating expenses, which includes total operating expenses. Total operating expenses include cost of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA operating expenses is calculated as Contribution ex-TAC less Adjusted EBITDA. We adjust Adjusted EBITDA operating expenses for the same expense items excluded in Adjusted EBITDA. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our performance for the following reasons:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company’s performance without regard to items such as those we exclude in calculating this measure, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired.\n\nOur management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies, and in communications with our board of directors concerning our performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also used as a metric for determining payment of cash incentive compensation.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA provides a measure of consistency and comparability with our past performance that many investors find useful, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, and also facilitates comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\n\nAlthough Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. These limitations include:\n\nStock-based compensation is a non-cash charge and will remain an element of our long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period.\n\nDepreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, and the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, but Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements.\n\nImpairment charges are non-cash charges related to goodwill, intangible assets and/or long-lived assets.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisition and related items, such as amortization of acquired intangible assets, merger, acquisition, or restructuring related severance costs, and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash and non-cash charges and changes in, or cash requirements for, acquisition and related items, such as certain transaction expenses.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash and non-cash charges related to certain financing transactions such as gains or losses on extinguishment of debt or other debt refinancing expenses.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in our working capital needs, capital expenditures, non-operational real estate expenses or income, or contractual commitments.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for income taxes and the cash impact of other income or expense.\n\nOther companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\nOur Adjusted EBITDA is influenced by fluctuations in our revenue, cost of revenue, and the timing and amounts of the cost of our operations. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nNon-GAAP Income (Loss) and Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) per Share:\n\nWe define non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share as non-GAAP income (loss) divided by non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding. Non-GAAP income (loss) is equal to net income (loss) excluding stock-based compensation, cash and non-cash based merger, acquisition, and restructuring costs, which consist primarily of professional service fees associated with merger and acquisition activities, cash-based employee termination costs, and other restructuring activities, including facility closures, relocation costs, contract termination costs, and impairment costs of abandoned technology associated with restructuring activities, amortization of acquired intangible assets, gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, non-operational real estate and other expenses or income, foreign currency gains and losses, interest expense associated with Convertible Senior Notes, other debt refinance expenses, and the tax impact of these items. In periods in which we have non-GAAP income, non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding used to calculate non-GAAP earnings per share includes the impact of potentially dilutive shares. Potentially dilutive shares consist of stock options, restricted stock units, performance stock units, and potential shares issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, each computed using the treasury stock method, and the impact of shares that would be issuable assuming conversion of all of the Convertible Senior Notes, calculated under the if-converted method. We believe non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance and our trends on a per share basis, and also facilitates comparison of our financial results on a per share basis with other companies, many of which present a similar non-GAAP measure. However, a potential limitation of our use of non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share is that other companies may define non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share differently, which may make comparison difficult. This measure may also exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. Non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share is a performance measure and should not be used as a measure of liquidity. Because of these limitations, we also consider the comparable GAAP measure of net income (loss).\n\nInvestor Relations Contact\n\nNick Kormeluk\n\n(949) 500-0003\n\nnkormeluk@magnite.com\n\nMedia
