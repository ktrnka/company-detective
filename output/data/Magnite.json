The company provides technology solutions that enable publishers to monetize their digital advertising inventory across various formats, including Connected TV (CTV), online video, display, and audio. Originally founded as The Rubicon Project, Inc. in 2007, the company rebranded to Magnite in July 2020. Headquartered in New York City, Magnite operates globally with offices in major markets such as Los Angeles, London, Singapore, and Sydney [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/).\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, Magnite employed approximately 911 full-time employees. The company reported a market capitalization of approximately $1.68 billion, with a trailing revenue of $649.22 million and a net income loss of $5.4 million [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/). Magnite's business model is primarily B2B, serving publishers and advertisers by providing a platform that facilitates the buying and selling of digital ad space. The company's revenue is generated through fees charged for transactions conducted on its platform.\n\nMagnite's platform supports billions of advertising transactions each month, highlighting its significant scale and reach within the digital advertising ecosystem [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/). The company has been active in forming strategic partnerships to enhance its offerings, including collaborations with TF1 PUB, Blitz, and Netflix, which are expected to bolster its CTV advertising capabilities [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/news/); [(The Motley Fool, 2024)](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/05/16/why-magnite-stock-skyrocketed-thursday-morning/).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nMichael G. Barrett serves as the President and CEO of Magnite. He has expressed optimism about the company's growth, particularly in the CTV segment, citing a positive ad spend environment and share gains as key factors contributing to the company's momentum [(StockNews.com, 2024)](https://stocknews.com/news/mgni-nexn-crto-tbla-is-magnite-a-top-pick-in-digital-advertising/).\n\n# News\n\n## Financial Performance\n\nMagnite's financial performance has been mixed. In Q2 2024, the company reported a revenue of $162.9 million, a 7% increase year-over-year, with a contribution ex-TAC of $146.8 million, up 9% year-over-year. However, the company also reported a loss of $1.1 million for the quarter, indicating ongoing challenges in achieving profitability [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/). Despite these challenges, analysts have a positive outlook for Magnite, with expectations for revenue growth of 10.6% in the fiscal year ending December 2024 [(StockNews.com, 2024)](https://stocknews.com/news/mgni-nexn-crto-tbla-is-magnite-a-top-pick-in-digital-advertising/).\n\n## Partnerships and Acquisitions\n\nMagnite has secured several strategic partnerships, including with TF1 PUB and Blitz, to enhance its programmatic advertising solutions. A significant partnership with Netflix is expected to enhance Magnite's CTV advertising capabilities, potentially making Netflix one of its largest customers by the end of 2025 [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/news/); [(The Motley Fool, 2024)](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/05/16/why-magnite-stock-skyrocketed-thursday-morning/).\n\n## Financial Maneuvers\n\nOn September 18, 2024, Magnite completed a term loan repricing, reducing its interest rate by 75 basis points, which is expected to save the company over $2.7 million in annual interest payments [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/news/).\n\n## Market Position and Challenges\n\nDespite its leading position in the adtech space, Magnite faces challenges, including competition from larger players and the need to improve profitability. Recent reports indicated a decline in stock following concerns about its relationship with Disney and potential impacts on revenue from key partnerships [(The Globe and Mail, 2024)](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/markets-news/Motley%20Fool/28829585/why-magnite-stock-was-falling-today/).\n\n# Additional Reading\n\n- [Magnite Legal & Privacy Policies](https://www.magnite.com/legal/)\n- [Magnite Insights](https://www.magnite.com/insights/)\n- [Magnite Research](https://www.magnite.com/research/)\n- [Magnite Careers Overview](https://www.magnite.com/careers/)\n- [Magnite ESG Overview](https://www.magnite.com/esg/)\n- [Magnite SpringServe Master Terms](https://www.magnite.com/legal/springserveterms/)\n- [Magnite Contact Us](https://www.magnite.com/contact-us/)\n\nMagnite, Inc. remains a significant player in the digital advertising landscape, with a robust platform and strategic partnerships that position it for future growth.

The terms and conditions of the Agreement and the SpringServe Materials are the Confidential Information of Magnite. As to both parties, Confidential Information also includes business and marketing plans, software code, technology and technical information, product and system designs and configurations, specifications, APIs, trade secrets, and business processes. However, Confidential Information shall not include any information that: (i) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to Disclosing Party; (ii) was known to Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party without restriction on use or disclosure; (iii) was independently developed by Receiving Party without reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information or breach of any obligation owed to Disclosing Party; or (iv) is rightfully received from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure.\n\n(b) Restrictions; Use. Receiving Party shall not use or disclose the Confidential Information of Disclosing Party, without Disclosing Party’s consent, for any purpose other than to perform Receiving Party’s obligations or exercise its rights under the Agreement, as of the Effective Date or as subsequently updated. Such disclosures shall only be made to those third parties who are bound by confidentiality obligations with respect to such Confidential Information that are at least as protective as those set forth herein, and Receiving Party shall be responsible and liable for the failure of any such third party to treat the Confidential Information in accordance with Receiving Party’s obligations. Receiving Party shall protect the confidentiality of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in the same manner that it protects the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind (but in no event using less than reasonable care). Receiving Party shall promptly notify Disclosing Party if it becomes aware of any actual or reasonably suspected unauthorized disclosure of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.\n\n(c) Legal Disclosure. If Receiving Party is compelled by law or legal process to disclose the Confidential Information of Disclosing Party, it shall provide Disclosing Party with (i) prompt prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and (ii) reasonable assistance, at Disclosing Party’s expense, if Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. In any event, such disclosure shall be strictly limited to the Confidential Information that is required to be so disclosed by law or legal process.\n\n4.2 Privacy and Data Usage.\n\n(a) Privacy Laws. Customer shall ensure that its use of the SpringServe Materials, including with regard to any data and/or data segments that Customer uploads or has uploaded on its behalf, complies with its obligations under (i) all applicable privacy laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and any other laws materially similar in form or scope to the foregoing, and including any rules promulgated pursuant to the foregoing and each as amended from time to time (collectively, the “State Privacy Laws”), the Regulation 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) (“GDPR”), the GDPR as incorporated into United Kingdom law pursuant to section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal Act) 2018 (“UK GDPR”), and any implementation of the European Union Directive 2002/58/EC (as modified by Directive 2009/136/EC), and any replacement legislation, and (ii) generally accepted privacy self-regulatory guidelines, such as the principles of the Digital Advertising Alliance and the code of the Network Advertising Initiative, as updated, supplemented or amended from time to time, ((i) and (ii), collectively, the “Privacy Laws”). When sending Ad requests to Magnite, Customer shall honor and not inhibit, circumvent, disrupt, or otherwise compromise the actual user choice to opt out (including to opt out of “targeted advertising”, “sharing”, or “sales” of personal data as such terms are defined in the State Privacy Laws), limit ad tracking, or other similar setting or preference, as indicated by the end user, with respect to each applicable application or platform.\n\n(b) Privacy Policies. Customer agrees to post on its website and all Media an up-to-date and accurate privacy policy, and/or provide the appropriate link to such a policy within its Media, that: (i) complies with all applicable Privacy Laws and (ii) accurately discloses all applicable data collection, use, and disclosure practices, including, but not limited to, an explanation of the purposes for which data is collected by or will be transferred to, third parties, the use of cookies, pixels, beacons, locally stored objects, or other similar technologies by third parties for purposes of targeting individual end users with interest-based, and other types of advertisements. Customer and each seller of the Media shall comply with its respective privacy polic(ies). Customer further agrees that its and the Media privacy polic(ies) will provide (i) consumers subject to the State Privacy Laws a functioning method to opt-out of “sales”, “sharing” and “targeted advertising” by the Customer as required by the State Privacy Laws; and (ii) all end users with a conspicuous link to a functional opt-out page. If Customer uses the SpringServe Materials to buy or sell Ad Inventory directly or indirectly on behalf of any third party, Customer will ensure that such third party complies with this Section 4.2.\n\n(c) Data. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, Magnite shall have the right to collect, use, and disclose data transmitted through or otherwise derived from Customer’s use of the SpringServe Materials as described in the applicable Magnite privacy polic(ies).\n\n(d) Required Consent. To the extent that any data, including persistent identifiers (such as IP address or device identifiers) or precise geo-location data, about end users are collected, used, transmitted, or processed by or on behalf of Customer or a party on behalf of which Customer is directly or indirectly buying or selling Ad Inventory using SpringServe Materials, Customer represents and warrants that all necessary disclosures have been provided to and appropriate consents have been or will be obtained from such end user (“Required Consents”), as applicable. These Required Consents include, but are not limited to, those necessary to collect information about individual end users through the use of technologies, such as cookies and pixels, located on the end user’s device, and to pass such information to Magnite for processing in accordance with the Agreement. All Required Consents shall be obtained by Customer before any such technologies are set on the applicable end user’s device, regardless of whether such technologies are set directly by Customer or by or through Magnite. Customer shall not directly or indirectly pass Magnite any information that permanently identifies a particular device.\n\n(e) European Data Protection Law. Magnite collects certain data from Customer’s use of the SpringServe Materials, which may include end user “personal data” as defined in European data protection law (“Personal Data”). Magnite and Customer shall process such personal data as data controllers. Customer and Magnite agree to implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect the Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, loss of integrity, and against all other unlawful forms of processing. Further, Magnite and Customer will not process any Personal Data outside of Europe, unless it first implements appropriate safeguards for the Personal Data that satisfy the requirements of European data protection law.\n\n(f) State Privacy Laws. For purposes of State Privacy Laws, Magnite will receive such personal information as a third party and acts as a controller with respect to such personal information. In the event of changes to the State Privacy Laws or issuance of applicable regulation, court order or governmental guidance relating to the State Privacy Laws, Magnite may modify the terms of the Agreement if such change does not have a material adverse impact on Customer and only if mutually agreed upon in writing. For purposes of this Section 4.2(f), (i) the terms “commercial purpose”, “consumer”, “controller”, “personal information”, “processor”, “process”, “sale”, “share” and “targeted advertising” as used herein have the meanings given in the CCPA and (ii) references to “controller”, “personal information” and “processor” include “business”, “personal data” and “service provider” respectively.\n\nMagnite and Customer will comply with their respective obligations under State Privacy Laws with respect to the processing of personal information governed by the Agreement and, where applicable, will also require that their vendors comply with the same.\n\nWhere processing deidentified data, Magnite and Customer further agree to (i) not attempt to reidentify such data; (ii) use reasonable administrative, technical and organizational measures to prevent reidentification or inadvertent release of the data; and (iii) publicly commit to maintain and use the data in deidentified form and not attempt to reidentify the data.\n\nAdditional CCPA Commitments:\n\nIf personal data is subject to the CCPA, this Section “Additional CCPA Commitments” applies. Magnite will: (i) comply with applicable obligations under the CCPA, including by providing the same level of privacy protection as required of “businesses” under the CCPA; (ii) notify Customer if it can no longer meet its obligations under the CCPA; and (iii) grant Customer the right to take reasonable and appropriate steps to help ensure Magnite is using the personal information in a manner consistent with the CCPA, such as by requesting information or an attestation from Magnite.\n\nIf Customer believes that Magnite is engaged in unauthorized use of personal data provided by Customer, upon notice to Magnite, the Parties will work together in good faith to stop or remediate the allegedly unauthorized use of such personal information, as necessary. Where Magnite receives from Customer personal information subject to the CCPA, Customer makes such personal information available to Magnite for the commercial purposes of performing advertising and related services, as further specified in the Agreement and Magnite will process such personal information only for such purposes and subject to any restrictions outlined in the Agreement.\n\n(g) Kids’ Sites. Customer shall not make Ad Inventory available on a Kids’ Site (as defined below), unless permitted by Magnite in a written amendment signed by both parties. As used herein, “Kids’ Site” refers to any Media: (a) directed to children located in the U.S. (or any U.S. territory thereof) who are under the age of 16; (b) directed to children located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) who are younger than the applicable age required for parental consent; or (c) directed to children, as defined by laws of any other jurisdiction. Customer may not, except to the extent permitted by applicable law, use the SpringServe Materials to: (i) create profiles of visitors of Kids’ Sites or of any users that Customer knows to be under the applicable age of parental consent requirements (“Kids”); (ii) purchase, sell, place, or facilitate the placement of behaviorally targeted Ads on Kids’ Sites; or (iii) collect personal information (as defined by the United States’ Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act), personal data (as defined by GDPR), or comparable data under any similar law of any jurisdiction, about Kids or visitors of Kids’ Sites. Magnite undertakes no obligation to identify Kids Sites or to monitor the compliance of Buyers or Sellers with respect to identifying Kids Sites.\n\nTERM AND TERMINATION\n\n5.1 Term. The Agreement begins on the Effective Date and will continue until terminated as permitted. Each party may terminate the Agreement in whole or terminate any individual Service at any time for any reason, without penalty, by providing thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the other party. The termination of an individual Service will not impact the term of the Agreement or any other Service, unless the provision of another Service depends upon the terminated Service (in which case, both Services will be deemed terminated).\n\n5.2 Suspension; Termination. In addition to its other termination rights specified in the Agreement, Magnite may limit and/or suspend Customer’s access to and use of the SpringServe Materials (including ceasing purchase, sale, delivery, or serving of Ads or Ad Inventory) if Magnite has a reasonable basis to suspect that (a) Customer is violating the terms of the Agreement, (b) Customer’s account remains inactive for at least twelve (12) months, (c) Customer’s use of the SpringServe Materials is likely to damage or cause harm or risk to Magnite, the SpringServe Materials, other customers, or end users of Media or their data, devices, or systems, or (d) Customer becomes insolvent or generally unable to pay its debts as they become due, or becomes the subject of any bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution, or similar proceeding, or has made an assignment for the benefit of creditor or similar disposition of its assets. Magnite will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with notice prior to any limitation or suspension, but in any event will notify Customer promptly thereafter. If an event giving rise to a limitation or suspension is able to be cured (as reasonably determined by Magnite), Customer shall have five (5) days to cure (“Suspension Window”). If Customer has not cured before the expiration of the Suspension Window, or the limitation or suspension is not able to be cured (as reasonably determined by Magnite), then Magnite may terminate the Agreement or any Service in whole or in part upon written notice (email acceptable).\n\n5.3 Effect of Termination. Upon termination of the Agreement or any Service in whole or in part, the following will apply either in total or in relation to the individually terminated Service, as applicable: (a) all access rights granted to the SpringServe Materials shall immediately terminate; (b) Customer will cease all use of SpringServe Materials; and (c) the following will survive: (i) any provisions specified by their terms to survive; and (ii) provisions of the Agreement that, by their nature, are applicable to matters at issue between the parties after termination of the Agreement, such as accrued unpaid payment obligations, limitation of liability, indemnities, confidentiality, and proprietary rights.\n\nREPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; DISCLAIMER\n\n6.1 Mutual Representations and Warranties. Each party represents and warrants to the other that: (a) it has the full corporate right, power, and authority to enter into the Agreement and to exercise its rights and perform its obligations; (b) its execution and delivery of the Agreement, and the performance of its obligations and duties in connection therewith, do not and will not violate any agreement to which it is bound; and (c) it shall comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations in performing its respective obligations and exercising its rights under the Agreement, including with respect to consumer protection and privacy.\n\n6.2 Disclaimer. Except for the express representations and warranties stated herein and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither party makes, and each party expressly disclaims, all representations, conditions, terms and warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the subject matter of the Agreement, including without limitation any implied representation, term, or warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Without limiting the generality of the above and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Magnite makes no representation or warranty (a) as to any Ad or Media or any benefit, performance, or revenues that Customer (or Customer’s clients or users) will obtain from its use of the SpringServe Materials, (b) that any particular Buyer relationships will be established or maintained through the SpringServe Services, (c) that Ads will be available for delivery or at a particular price, or (d) that the SpringServe Materials will be always available or bug or error-free.\n\nINDEMNIFICATION\n\n7.1 Customer Obligations. Subject to Section 7.3, Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Magnite, its permitted successors and assigns, and their respective Affiliates, agents, officers, directors, and employees (collectively, “Magnite Indemnified Parties”) from and against any claims, suits, legal proceedings, regulatory proceedings, or investigatory proceedings (“Claims”) brought against any Magnite Indemnified Party by any third party and any and all judgments, losses, damages, settlements, liabilities, fines, penalties, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) (“Losses”) arising as a result of any such Claim, in each case as a result of or in connection with: (a) any false or misleading representation by Customer or any breach by Customer of any of its warranties or obligations under the Agreement; and (b) a Claim that Media provided or delivered by Customer through the SpringServe Materials, Customer’s Marks, or Customer’s business activities infringe any Intellectual Property Right of any third party ((a) – (b) each being a “Customer Indemnifiable Act”).\n\n7.2 Magnite Obligations. Subject to Section 7.3, Magnite shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Customer, its successors and assigns, and their respective Affiliates, agents, officers, directors, and employees (“Customer Indemnified Parties”) from and against any Claim brought against any Customer Indemnified Party by any third party and any Losses arising as a result of any such Claim, in each case as a result of or in connection with: (a) any false or misleading representation by Magnite or any breach by Magnite of any of its warranties or obligations under the Agreement; or (b) a Claim that the SpringServe Materials, when used in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, infringe any Intellectual Property Right of any third party. In the event a Claim under Section 7.2(b) is made or, in Magnite’s reasonable opinion, is likely to be made, or if required by settlement, Magnite may elect, at its sole option and expense, to: (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the SpringServe Materials that are the subject of such Claim, (ii) replace or modify the SpringServe Materials that are the subject of such Claim to be non-infringing without material decrease in functionality, or (iii) terminate the Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Magnite shall have no liability for any infringement Claim under this Section 7.2 to the extent such Claim results from: (i) modifications to the SpringServe Materials by or on behalf of a Customer Indemnified Party, or (ii) use or combination of any SpringServe Materials with any other item not provided by Magnite; in each case without the prior written consent of Magnite.\n\n7.3 Procedure.\n\n(a) Notice and Reasonable Assistance. In the event of a Claim, the indemnified party shall provide prompt notice of the Claim to the indemnifying party. A failure to provide prompt notice shall not release the indemnifying party from its indemnification obligations under the Agreement, but it will reduce those indemnification obligations by the amount (if any) of additional Losses attributable to the delayed notification. The indemnified party shall also provide reasonable information and assistance needed to defend or settle the Claim (provided the indemnifying party bears any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the indemnified party in providing such assistance or information).\n\n(b) Control of Claim. The indemnifying party of any Claim shall have sole control of the investigation, defense, and settlement of the Claim, provided that the indemnifying party does not enter into any settlement of a Claim that: (i) imposes a monetary obligation on the indemnified party that is not covered by the indemnification; (ii) imposes a material, non-monetary obligation on the indemnified party; (iii) does not include an unconditional release of the indemnified party; (iv) admits liability on the part of the indemnified party; and/or (v) is non-confidential (collectively, the “Settlement Restrictions”). Any settlement that does not comply with the Settlement Restrictions in full will require the prior written consent of the indemnified party.\n\nLIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n\n8.1 Limitations; Liability Cap. SUBJECT TO SECTION 8.2, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL (A) EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR (B) EITHER PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER IN CONNECTION WITH THE AGREEMENT, UNDER ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY, EXCEED U.S. $250,000 (OR ITS EQUIVALENT).\n\n8.2. Exclusions. THE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY SET FORTH IN SECTION 8.1 SHALL NOT APPLY TO: (A) A BREACH OF SECTION 3.1 (RIGHT TO ACCESS AND RESTRICTIONS); (B) A BREACH OF SECTION 4.1 (CONFIDENTIALITY); (C) A CLAIM FOR INDEMNIFICATION UNDER SECTION 7.1; (D) THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, OR FRAUDULENT, CRIMINAL, OR MALICIOUS CONDUCT OF THE PARTY SEEKING TO LIMIT ITS DAMAGES; OR (E) AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO MAGNITE UNDER THE AGREEMENT.\n\nBINDING ARBITRATION & CLASS ACTION WAIVER\n\n9.1 Arbitration. As a material part of the Agreement, any and all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to the Agreement shall be determined exclusively by confidential, final, and binding arbitration as follows:\n\n(a) General. Unless the parties mutually agree to another arbitration service provider, the matters submitted to arbitration shall be heard and determined by a single arbitrator in Los Angeles (or another mutually agreed upon venue), in accordance with the then-existing comprehensive arbitration rules or the streamlined arbitration rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”). Any party to the arbitration may request JAMS to identify panels of retired or former jurists qualified and able to sit as arbitrators of the matters submitted for arbitration and the arbitrator determining the submitted matters shall be selected from such panels pursuant to JAMS rules. Except as otherwise determined by the arbitrator, the fees of the arbitration charged by JAMS initially will be paid equally by both parties. However, the arbitrator shall have the right to order either party to pay all fees and costs as part of the award.\n\n(b) Waiver; Final Award. By agreeing to submit all disputes, claims and controversies to binding arbitration, Customer and SpringServe expressly waive their rights to have such matters heard or tried in court before a judge or jury or in another tribunal. Unless an arbitrator commits errors of law or legal reasoning, any arbitration award shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties, subject only to judicial review provided by statutes governing arbitrations, and a judgment rendered on the arbitration award may be entered in any state or federal court having jurisdiction thereof.\n\n9.2 Class Action Waiver. Customer and Magnite agree that each may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, mass action, or representative action.\n\nTAXES. Customer is solely responsible for payment of any Taxes applicable to its transactions under the Agreement and/or its use of any Service (whether those Taxes are collected and remitted by Magnite or paid directly to the relevant authorities by Customer), except for Taxes based on Magnite’s net income. Customer shall provide Magnite with an IRS form W9 or W-8BEN, as applicable. Upon Magnite’s request and as applicable, Customer shall also provide Magnite with a treaty residency certificate, VAT registration proof, and/or any other relevant documents for tax compliance purposes.\n\nIf and only if Customer is currently based or becomes based (whether as the original Customer or through assignment of this Agreement) in a jurisdiction outside of the United States to which withholding taxes apply, then the following language will also apply: Any applicable Taxes not collected by Magnite from Customer shall be paid by Customer to the relevant authorities directly, and in such circumstances, Customer shall: (a) gross-up such payment to fully-account for such Tax, (b) immediately tender the relevant amount of Tax to the appropriate authorities, and (c) promptly thereafter, inform Magnite in writing that such Taxes have been paid and provide such documentation (including original receipts or other governmental documentation, or copies thereof) as may reasonably be requested by Magnite to ensure that Magnite is satisfied that it will not bear any financial liability of Tax to such authorities in respect of such payment. To the extent that Customer reasonably determines that any payment to Magnite is subject to withholding Tax, Customer shall provide prompt notification to Magnite of such fact in writing, and Magnite shall thereafter provide Customer with a treaty residency certificate, or other similar governmental document, as reasonably requested by Customer.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\n\n11.1 Assignment. Customer may not assign, subcontract, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any or all of its rights and/or obligations under the Agreement without the prior written consent of Magnite (not to be unreasonably withheld). Customer is not required to obtain the prior written consent of Magnite in the event of a Change of Control of Customer, provided that the acquirer(s) assumes Customer’s obligations hereunder after such Change of Control and provided further that the Change of Control does not involve a direct competitor of Magnite, as determined by Magnite in its sole discretion. Customer shall notify Magnite of any Change of Control permitted by this Section 11.1 within 30 days of the consummation thereof. As used herein, “Change of Control” means (a) the merger or consolidation of Customer with another entity; (b) a transaction or series of related transactions in which a third party becomes the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the combined voting power of the outstanding securities of Customer; or (c) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Customer. Any attempted assignment by Customer in breach of this Section 11.1 shall be void. The provisions of the Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties’ respective transferees, successors, and assigns.\n\n11.2 Governing Law; Venue. The Agreement will be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California without reference to conflicts of laws principles. Jurisdiction and venue for all disputes hereunder shall be in Los Angeles County, California. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to the Agreement.\n\n11.3 Non-Exclusive Relationship. The Agreement is non-exclusive and either party may engage in similar or other relationships, agreements, or arrangements with any other party.\n\n11.4 Independent Relationship of the Parties. The relationship between Customer and Magnite (and its personnel or agents) in connection with the Agreement is at all times that of an independent contractor and neither party is an employee, partner, agent, trustee or joint venturer of, for, or with the other. Except to the extent otherwise provided in the Agreement or under applicable law, neither party shall owe any fiduciary or other duties to the other.\n\n11.5 Other Customers. To the extent that another customer of Magnite incurs Losses as a result of any Customer Indemnifiable Act, Customer acknowledges and agrees that such other customer may recover such Losses from Customer directly and will be deemed a third-party beneficiary of this Section 11.5.\n\n11.6 Interpretations. Headings and captions are for convenience only and do not affect the meaning or interpretation of the Agreement. Ambiguities, inconsistencies, or conflicts in the Agreement will be resolved by applying the most reasonable interpretation under the circumstances, giving full consideration to the parties’ intentions at the time the Agreement was entered into and common practice in the industry at that time. The term “including” or “includes” means “including/includes without limitation.” The Agreement shall not be construed against any party by reason of its drafting, preparation, or means of acceptance.\n\n11.7 Public Relations. During the Term of the Agreement, Magnite may use Customer’s Marks in general promotional and informational materials. Except as permitted in the Agreement, neither party shall use the name of the other party in publicity, advertising, or other public materials (unless required by applicable law or regulation) without the prior written consent of the other party.\n\n11.8 Notices. All notices under the Agreement must be made in writing. Notices to Customer shall be made in the applicable user interface (“UI”) for the Service or by email to then-current contact information available to Magnite. Notices to Magnite shall be made by email to legal@magnite.com. Electronic notice will be effective as of the date of posting (for notice within the UI) or as of the sent date (for email notice).\n\n11.9 Advice of Counsel. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL AND HAS READ AND UNDERSTOOD ALL OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THE AGREEMENT.\n\n11.10 Modifications. Magnite will provide Customer with written notice via email or through a general notice displayed within the applicable Service of any material changes (including applicable fees), additions, or deletions to the Agreement applicable to Customer (“Modifications”). If Customer determines in its reasonable discretion that a Modification will have a material, adverse effect on Customer, then for a period of ten (10) business days after the date of notice by Magnite (the “Termination Window”), Customer may, as its sole and exclusive remedy for any Modification, terminate the Agreement upon written notice to Magnite. By continuing to access or use the SpringServe Materials after such Termination Window, Customer agrees to be bound by such Modification.\n\n11.11 Force Majeure. Except for any payment obligations, neither party nor its Affiliates will be liable for any delay or failure to perform hereunder due to circumstances beyond such party’s reasonable control including earthquake, flood, fire, hurricane, tornado, natural disaster, acts of God, riot, national emergency, epidemic or other public health emergency, quarantine, government action or regulation, war, invasion, act of foreign enemies, hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorism, civil war, rebellion, revolution, radiation, other toxic or hazardous contamination, nuclear accident or explosion, restrictions on commodities or supplies, strikes or industrial disputes, or disruptions involving power or infrastructure systems not within such party’s possession or reasonable control (each a “Force Majeure Event”).\n\n11.12 Export Compliance. Customer agrees to comply with the export laws and regulations of the United States and with applicable trade controls of other countries (and that in cases of conflict or inconsistency among applicable export and import laws and regulations, U.S. law shall govern). Customer shall not use the SpringServe Materials to conduct, promote or facilitate business, or target end users in countries subject to U.S. embargo or trade sanctions.\n\n11.13 Anti-Corruption. Customer agrees (a) to comply with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and UK Bribery Act 2010, in relation to the Agreement; and (b) that it will not offer to pay or pay anything of value to anyone, including foreign governmental officials or related persons or entities on Magnite’s behalf.",

Magnite is most common in the Magma Core and Glacial Strata, 2 of the least popular biomes.

Let's say you are a toilet paper distributor as an aggregator that sells TP to retail stores. You sell to Target, Walmart, and Costco. The latest legislative rulings mean toilet paper can no longer be sold with brand names or unique packaging. \n\nConsumers will know by context clues that they are buying toilet paper and prices differ. What happens? The retail stores continue to sell toilet paper but their margins may shift as consumers no longer buy brand names. The retail stores with proprietary owned toilet paper may benefit as consumers no longer care about branding. A store like Costco may gain buyers as value becomes a primary differentiator. \n\nWhat about the toilet paper distributor? Toilet paper demand isn't changing. Their business may have had less upside in the past but now revenue risk is mitigated. TP continues to be sold in the same quantity but with different distribution by retail store.\n\nIn our case, Magnite is the aggregator distributor. Cookie deprecation matters but not to the same degree as the retail store (any DSP). TTD carries its \"open\" badge with honor, but they don't own any inventory or proprietary data which is an issue with the ongoing regulatory changes, see CPRA and GDPR. \n\nHow can the big box retailers differentiate their brand-less toilet paper without exceeding regulatory policy?\n\n## Comment ID hlwnsib with +7 score by [(dnchw2, Reddit, 2021-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/r16ui9/trade_desk_vs_magnite_why_is_one_stock_a_rocket/hlwnsib/) (in reply to ID r16ui9):\ni noticed that TTD gets media coverage on their new roll outs. \n\npeople use TTD revenue as a demand for online advertising so they share signals of spend.\n\n## Comment ID hmpfjif with +3 score by [(zdogmasterfly, Reddit, 2021-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/r16ui9/trade_desk_vs_magnite_why_is_one_stock_a_rocket/hmpfjif/) (in reply to ID r16ui9):\nThere are 2 big, macro-economic reasons, and several more reasons specific to these two companies.\n\nOne important thing to understand is that most of advertising is demand-constrained (or, over-supplied) -- for the simple reason that it is much easier to create another 30-second ad slot, put another banner ad on your blog, or create a YouTube video than it is to extract another dollar from Coca-Cola, P&G, etc.  Especially in digital, it will forever be easier to create new inventory than it will be to create products to sell.  Basic market economics show that whomever controls the scarcity has the advantage.  Thus, if you have the ability to be on the demand-side, that's where you want to be.\n\nTo explain the second macro reason for TTD's success compared to Magnite, I need to challenge one of the premises of OP's post… These two companies do NOT do primarily the same thing -- they do very different things, with very different values to the parties with the money.  This goes back to Wanamaker's century-old adage: \"Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half.\"  Arguably, the most value anyone can add an advertiser is helping them make a more optimal decision where to spend their money.  This is TTD's business.  Magnite, at its best, helps optimize yield for publishers, but even then publishers aren't the ones who pay them.  And, more typically, they are just pipes to connect DSPs with publishers.  The end-game for SSPs is low-margin, high-volume -- i.e. commoditization.  For this reason, we will continue to see consolidation in the SSP space, likely to AdX plus 1-2 non-AdX.  Magnite has a good shot to be one of those 1-2 non-AdX big players at end-state, but even if this does play out, it's not a high-value spot to occupy in the stack.  Just look at financial markets for an analogy: A single investment bank like Goldman Sachs has a larger market cap than all the US stock exchanges combined.\n\nApart from these macro reasons, these specific companies are very different.  TTD has a sterling track record as a public company, having beat-and-raised every quarter since their IPO -- 20 quarters in a row.  TTD also has been solidly profitable for years prior to their IPO while still growing revenue at a healthy clip year over year.  Magnite, on the other hand, has missed earnings for the past 2 quarters has gone in and out of profitability throughout their history.  TTD is a visionary company that has carried the entire industry on its back.  Magnite floundered for years as Rubicon, missing the header bidding opportunity, trying be a DSP, etc.  It was actually just in June 2021 that their TTM revenue finally recovered from the slip that began in late-2016 -- they've been essentially playing catchup the entire time TTD has been public.  Rubicon made a very smart and critical move by ditching their DSP and merging with Telaria to finally get scale on the CTV bandwagon, but their track record as a true leader has yet to be established.  Add to this that MGNI's P/E is over 7X that of TTD, and it's easy for me to understand why MGNI is flagging while TTD continues to grow strong.\n\n## Comment ID hlx95a9 with +4 score by [(iBarber111, Reddit, 2021-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/r16ui9/trade_desk_vs_magnite_why_is_one_stock_a_rocket/hlx95a9/) (in reply to ID r16ui9):\nI guess if you're just looking at the last few months....\n\nAs someone that bought MGNI at $7, I've been perfectly happy with their performance. They're up 100%+ from pre-pandemic levels. IMO, they were full-on rocketship early 2021 & the past 6 months have been just a bit of a return to Earth. Couldn't tell you why TTD kept rocketing while MGNI didn't, but it probably has something to do with the fact that MGNI's market cap is 1/25th TTD's & is more heavily affected by a couple of mediocre earnings reports, which they had.\n\nAlso, TTD's P/E ratio is 185, while MGNI's is 1500. So investors actually *are* pricing in a lot more future growth from MGNI than they are from TTD.\n\nI own both, but more MGNI. I just think aggregating CTV inventory is a winning play. While I agree with the user that wouldn't bet on them in the long run - it depends on your definition of 'long'. I don't see why they won't keep growing for at least a few years. i.e they sit in my brokerage account & not my retirement, lol.\n\n## Comment ID hly6s6s with +4 score by [(zabpremier, Reddit, 2021-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/r16ui9/trade_desk_vs_magnite_why_is_one_stock_a_rocket/hly6s6s/) (in reply to ID r16ui9):\nI don’t think they’re the same at all. DSPs can differentiate in a handful of ways (products, data, attribution, etc). There’s a huge difference between what TTD offers compared to a Yahoo, Google, etc. SSPs offer very little here, to buyers it might be a cutback or publisher roster. For pubs it’s really just a pipe that you’re hoping takes the least amount margin wise. All Magnite has done is acquire folks without developing any real tech differentiation.\n\n### Comment ID hm10uch with +1 score by [(subcow, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/r16ui9/trade_desk_vs_magnite_why_is_one_stock_a_rocket/hm10uch/) (in reply to ID hly6s6s):\nYes and no. I sit on the pub side, and I work with SSPs daily. I worked on the SSP side in the past.  SSPs see the writing on the wall about commoditiztion, and some of them at least have been working to differentiate themselves. Some do it simply through having better customer service. Some actually help me make connections with buyers/advertisers so I can land PMP deals, while some bring more deals directly to the table for me.\n\n#### Comment ID hm12ik2 with +2 score by [(zabpremier, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/r16ui9/trade_desk_vs_magnite_why_is_one_stock_a_rocket/hm12ik2/) (in reply to ID hm10uch):\nI’m on the pub programmatic sales side as well and agree with you to a certain extent. Customer service and lead gen is certainly important but not in the same league of differentiation when comparing to DSPs. DSPs have truly unique data sets, UIs that are easy to use or meant for savvy buyers, specific integrations, and products in general. Customer service is a smart way of doing business versus a material difference in product but that’s just me. BTW - which SSPs give you good lead gen?

The other mineral veins are in smaller chunks or formations, but croppa spawns like gold or nitra veins. Large croppa veins can have 40+ units while the magnite spires are capped at what, 10 or 12? And some dwarves don't mine the full chunk or the remaining 'crusts' when the spire is halfway trapped in the floor. So even at a 3:1 ratio, a mission in an abundant croppa biome will often be better for acquiring magnite than a mission in an abundant magnite mission. Or any other mineral, because ya know, money can be exchanged for ~~goods and services~~ minerals. On a related note, I never buy croppa/ umanite from the daily deal and I never sell magnite/ bismor/ enor. Umanite typically sticks up out of smooth ground and Jadiz glows obviously in biomes it spawns in, but jadiz is more limited on amounts like the others--you see a double umanite spawn from time to time, almost never a double jadiz. As for enor/ bismor/ magnite, they are easy to miss and limited. Magnite is the worst offender because it doesn't glow and it can spawn halfway into the ground, making it hidden from many viewing angles. Bismor has this problem too as it is always a small object, but it has a relatively distinct look and some shimmer, so spotting it is not as difficult.\n\n### Comment ID l9oi1fn with +1 score by [(whydoyou-ask, Reddit, 2024-06-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/1dipr1h/why_is_magnite_5x_as_rare_as_the_other_minerals/l9oi1fn/) (in reply to ID l971f9l):\nI found a triple jadiz just the other day.

It wasn’t three sets of little glowing gems next to each other, it was one glowing area that was a bit oblong so there was some hint that there would be more than one in it.\n\n## Comment ID l95xpas with +8 score by [(Sir_Nope_TSS, Reddit, 2024-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/1dipr1h/why_is_magnite_5x_as_rare_as_the_other_minerals/l95xpas/) (in reply to ID 1dipr1h):\nMagnite will turn into ~~A 'Best of Queen' album~~ Jadiz if left in a dwarf's pockets overnight.\n\n## Comment ID l963npf with +8 score by [(Toneww, Reddit, 2024-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/1dipr1h/why_is_magnite_5x_as_rare_as_the_other_minerals/l963npf/) (in reply to ID 1dipr1h):\nYou find it in smaller quantities and in two of the least played biomes\n\n## Comment ID l95wrst with +7 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/1dipr1h/why_is_magnite_5x_as_rare_as_the_other_minerals/l95wrst/) (in reply to ID 1dipr1h):\nI’m having this problem too\n\n## Comment ID l95oc5h with +5 score by [(nick_____name, Reddit, 2024-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/1dipr1h/why_is_magnite_5x_as_rare_as_the_other_minerals/l95oc5h/) (in reply to ID 1dipr1h):\nIt’s not that it’s rare it’s just required for absolutely everything so you run out of it easier\n\n## Comment ID l961lmi with +3 score by [(Notafuzzycat, Reddit, 2024-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/1dipr1h/why_is_magnite_5x_as_rare_as_the_other_minerals/l961lmi/) (in reply to ID 1dipr1h):\nSell the ones you use less to buy the ones you use more. \n\nDRG just making bank off your hard work.\n\n## Comment ID l96dwwy with +4 score by [(err0rz, Reddit, 2024-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/1dipr1h/why_is_magnite_5x_as_rare_as_the_other_minerals/l96dwwy/) (in reply to ID 1dipr1h):\nMy theory is it’s mostly down to biome bias.\n\nThe biomes in which Magnite spawns are the biomes you are less likely to play in.\n\nI have the same issue except with Enor Pearl and Bismor.\n\n### Comment ID l96pr7e with +3 score by [(UnBR33vuhble, Reddit, 2024-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/1dipr1h/why_is_magnite_5x_as_rare_as_the_other_minerals/l96pr7e/) (in reply to ID l96dwwy):\nThat's my theory: they avoid the magma core, leading to a sharp drop in Magnite stocks.

Not so much harder that you always fail or anything, but enough harder you fail more often than most other biomes, which results in less rewards, so over many missions you end up with a lot less. Maybe you also tend to avoid missions in those biomes or decrease the difficulty which results in lesser rewards, personally I don’t but I still feel I end up with less magnite than other minerals and I think the reason is I’m a little more likely to fail missions there.\n\n## Comment ID l99fswt with +1 score by [(Snoot_Boot, Reddit, 2024-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/1dipr1h/why_is_magnite_5x_as_rare_as_the_other_minerals/l99fswt/) (in reply to ID 1dipr1h):\nWhat's magnite?\n\n## Comment ID l99kqbq with +1 score by [(camrynbronk, Reddit, 2024-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/1dipr1h/why_is_magnite_5x_as_rare_as_the_other_minerals/l99kqbq/) (in reply to ID 1dipr1h):\nYour magnite is my bismor.\n\n## Comment ID l99kt3z with +1 score by [(MeesMans, Reddit, 2024-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/1dipr1h/why_is_magnite_5x_as_rare_as_the_other_minerals/l99kt3z/) (in reply to ID 1dipr1h):\nand WHY do you need it for almost all overclocks??\n\n## Comment ID l99lnui with +1 score by [(MontagoDK, Reddit, 2024-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/1dipr1h/why_is_magnite_5x_as_rare_as_the_other_minerals/l99lnui/) (in reply to ID 1dipr1h):\nThe answer is to have 40.000 of each 😅\n\n## Comment ID l9a62ut with +1 score by [(HelmiPlayerOne, Reddit, 2024-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/1dipr1h/why_is_magnite_5x_as_rare_as_the_other_minerals/l9a62ut/) (in reply to ID 1dipr1h):\nI have a magnite overflow somehow, but lack jadiz\n\n## Comment ID l9a8b39 with +1 score by [(nosville22_PL, Reddit, 2024-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/1dipr1h/why_is_magnite_5x_as_rare_as_the_other_minerals/l9a8b39/) (in reply to ID 1dipr1h):\nhow ofthen do you play magma core or glacial strata?\n\nit's quite abundant in those two areas otherwise it's fairly rare or absent\n\n## Comment ID l9abd3f with +1 score by [(Vertnoir-Weyah, Reddit, 2024-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/1dipr1h/why_is_magnite_5x_as_rare_as_the_other_minerals/l9abd3f/) (in reply to ID 1dipr1h):\nI've been thinking about how some missions seem to spawn only/way more on certain biomes like salvage (haven't done the research) and then how having those missions in your assignment means you're not getting magnite and rarely enor pearls even though i'd argue those are harder to see and come in small amounts\n\n## Comment ID l9adzcd with +1 score by [(VexyValkyrie, Reddit, 2024-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/1dipr1h/why_is_magnite_5x_as_rare_as_the_other_minerals/l9adzcd/) (in reply to ID 1dipr1h):\nFor me it's Bismor.

There’s good amount of power and no CVT lag. Interiors are pretty subtle and there’s no hump in the rear which means comfortable seating. It also offers wireless Android auto and apple car play. Suspension is very comfortable.\nThe only downside I found that the co passenger seat height is pretty low so people with less height will feel as if they’re just seeing the dashboard.\nOverall, if I have to buy a car below 12 lacs, I’ll go for Magnite. \nBe aware that Magnite still feels like a small car and does not give you an SUVish feel that Brezza is able to give due to raised seating. But other than this Brezza is very dated and not value for money at least in the automatic trims.\n\nI don’t know about Punch, the looks are pretty weird though.\n\n## Comment ID hsqieq0 with +18 score by [(nobuddys, Reddit, 2022-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/s4dnqb/tata_punch_or_nissan_magnite/hsqieq0/) (in reply to ID s4dnqb):\nBetter Space + features - Magnite\n\n\nHandling - Punch\n\nIf your requirement is immediate, it's better to go for Punch.\n\n### Comment ID hsqjp5v with +3 score by [(sonikinesis, Reddit, 2022-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/s4dnqb/tata_punch_or_nissan_magnite/hsqjp5v/) (in reply to ID hsqieq0):\nWhat about service cost & convenience?\n\n#### Comment ID hsqjyer with +11 score by [(nobuddys, Reddit, 2022-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/s4dnqb/tata_punch_or_nissan_magnite/hsqjyer/) (in reply to ID hsqjp5v):\nNissan had some of the lowest service cost when I was looking at the Kicks.

What i hated about the magnite was that the clutch travel distance was more (b2b traffic will def give you pains), No dead pedal, moderate AC (small ac for the magnite, looks like the cooling wasn't sufficient), and like many videos i noticed the steering response was not that good.  \n\n\nFor Punch, the stability is good, and suspension is on par with magnite, has a Dead pedal next to the clutch (good for those long drives), service center for both are close to me like 2km, steering and Braking was on point. So i went with Punch Adventure at 7.3L, Magnite non turbo doesnt have Hill assists and was very similar to punch but the NA 1L felt it lacked the pushing power. Considering Tata cars, the spares in the long run wouldn't be an issue, couldn't say the same about Magnite.  Magnite has sold like 30k cars since the launch in end of 2020, and Punch reached similar figures in 3 months, so looking at the volumes and considering the availability of the spares i decided to hold on to my punch booking. Got my vehicle last week, damn i must say the suspension feels a lot lot good than in the TD vehicle.\n\n### Comment ID htzgwaq with +1 score by [(sonikinesis, Reddit, 2022-01-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/s4dnqb/tata_punch_or_nissan_magnite/htzgwaq/) (in reply to ID htz5slj):\nWhich variant you recommend for Punch?\n\n#### Comment ID htzjuuz with +1 score by [(neo222, Reddit, 2022-01-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/s4dnqb/tata_punch_or_nissan_magnite/htzjuuz/) (in reply to ID htzgwaq):\nFor punch, i got the adventure, but strictly speaking, punch for below 8l and for around 10l better to go with Nexon, the magnite turbo at 9.4 doesn't offer vfm, better to get Nexon XMS which offer amazing driving comfort, suspension, build quality sans the gadgets. Even the nexon XZ at 10.8L is amazing for its price.

They really don’t have any cars in their portfolio right now. They can pull the plug soon. \nAlso Magnite has very dated interiors. The plastic quality on doors and dashboard is very low.

The cars maybe good VFM but the service sucks. The standard response for any repair is replace. And since they dont have the parts in stock - you have to prepay and wait. The Nissan CVT is probably the best available in the low / mid range cars - as all the others only offer AMT options.\n\n## Comment ID kb5rvtl with +1 score by [(vamsivadrevu, Reddit, 2023-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/16pzu6v/my_father_is_buying_nissan_magnite/kb5rvtl/) (in reply to ID 16pzu6v):\nI bought a magnite turbo xv premium CVT 6 months ago. The turbo with CVT is the best option on magnite. Anything else is too much compromise and not enough value for money. \n\nTurbo CVT should be your choice if you want a smooth automatic and decent power. \n\nIf your requirement is manual, there are other better options at the same price. But a proper automatic with turbo is only magnite and kiger at this price point."

It worked better than I thought it would. But like most other corporations, stop with the drum beating and emptiness of setting goals as if we are cattle to be herded and prodded. Goal-setting itself isn't the problem -- the way it is forced and meaningless is. You want employees that *want* on their own to make the company better ... right? At least one of the subsidiaries you acquired had a better way of achieving this than you do. And this isn't nostalgia or hurt due to change. It doesn't have to be like that subsidiary ... but you could learn a lot from what worked there to be better than just cookie-cutter-corporate a lot of the time.",

This leads mid/junior employees to have higher turnover rates than expected.\n\nA lot of teams are very top-heavy, which leaves no room or possibility for others to get promoted. I was at Magnite for over 5 years, and we never once did a proper year end, employee evaluation. At other companies, you typically do your evaluation with your manager in December, who then provides feedback on how to grow in your career. Where you stand in terms of performance should not be a surprise, but at Magnite it is. When January comes around, random people get promoted, and your manager will just look at you shrug and say there wasn't enough budget for anyone else to get promoted. Given promotions only happen once a year, this is an extremely upsetting situation to be in, and is the exact reason why many people leave the company. \n\nEach team's RTO is different. Understandably, RTO is the new normal, but then everyone should be held to the same standard. There are engineers that need to be in the office 3x a week, but then several SALES people are allowed to work completely remote? People who lead large teams are completely remote? The company needs a more fair stance. It seems only senior level people at the company got permission to be remote, while everyone else is held to a different standard.",

C-level management was either incompetent or so out of touch they end up being incompetent, I couldn't tell. Middle management is a bunch of yes-men (men, no women) who aggressively play the \"just go with it even though it's a bad plan, it will get fixed eventually\" card and as far as I can tell they are all highly loaded with stock and just playing a waiting game to dump it all as soon as it vests.. I can't blame them there. Day to day is a slew of overstaffed meetings that should have been (or already were) tracked issues and don't really accomplish anything with some spurts of work thrown in. At SpotX I would be able to get about 20-25 hours per 40hr week of active work completed and Magnite I was peaking in the mid to low teens. It seems from my view that every piece of infrastructure is set up by only skimming documentation and then getting it to a place at which it just barely functions then moving on and never ever coming back to get it out of alpha stage. Bugs become features, duct tape becomes structural and all that. Honestly I have never seen a more toxic work environment. The back to office mandate that all but management follows was a cherry. I loved spotx because of the teams and attitude of all trying to push in the same direction and we all tried that at magnite when we got acquired.. and got promptly thrown under every bus they could find. I'm glad I got a package, others were not so lucky. Beware of the politics in middle management, some of them can lie very well, and pay attention to who is the one pulling their strings. Check the companies cycle of funding, quarterly reports and then immediate stock dumps by all employees.",

        "cons": "I was only at Magnite for 2 years and was actually hired by the acquired SpotX 8 years prior to that so I'm sure my situation was not exactly shared by everyone. C-level management was either incompetent or so out of touch they end up being incompetent, I couldn't tell. Middle management is a bunch of yes-men (men, no women) who aggressively play the \"just go with it even though it's a bad plan, it will get fixed eventually\" card and as far as I can tell they are all highly loaded with stock and just playing a waiting game to dump it all as soon as it vests.. I can't blame them there. Day to day is a slew of overstaffed meetings that should have been (or already were) tracked issues and don't really accomplish anything with some spurts of work thrown in. At SpotX I would be able to get about 20-25 hours per 40hr week of active work completed and Magnite I was peaking in the mid to low teens. It seems from my view that every piece of infrastructure is set up by only skimming documentation and then getting it to a place at which it just barely functions then moving on and never ever coming back to get it out of alpha stage. Bugs become features, duct tape becomes structural and all that. Honestly I have never seen a more toxic work environment. The back to office mandate that all but management follows was a cherry. I loved spotx because of the teams and attitude of all trying to push in the same direction and we all tried that at magnite when we got acquired.. and got promptly thrown under every bus they could find. I'm glad I got a package, others were not so lucky. Beware of the politics in middle management, some of them can lie very well, and pay attention to who is the one pulling their strings. Check the companies cycle of funding, quarterly reports and then immediate stock dumps by all employees.",

This leads mid/junior employees to have higher turnover rates than expected.\n\nA lot of teams are very top-heavy, which leaves no room or possibility for others to get promoted. I was at Magnite for over 5 years, and we never once did a proper year end, employee evaluation. At other companies, you typically do your evaluation with your manager in December, who then provides feedback on how to grow in your career. Where you stand in terms of performance should not be a surprise, but at Magnite it is. When January comes around, random people get promoted, and your manager will just look at you shrug and say there wasn't enough budget for anyone else to get promoted. Given promotions only happen once a year, this is an extremely upsetting situation to be in, and is the exact reason why many people leave the company. \n\nEach team's RTO is different. Understandably, RTO is the new normal, but then everyone should be held to the same standard. There are engineers that need to be in the office 3x a week, but then several SALES people are allowed to work completely remote? People who lead large teams are completely remote? The company needs a more fair stance. It seems only senior level people at the company got permission to be remote, while everyone else is held to a different standard.",

It worked better than I thought it would. But like most other corporations, stop with the drum beating and emptiness of setting goals as if we are cattle to be herded and prodded. Goal-setting itself isn't the problem -- the way it is forced and meaningless is. You want employees that *want* on their own to make the company better ... right? At least one of the subsidiaries you acquired had a better way of achieving this than you do. And this isn't nostalgia or hurt due to change.

In a leaked image, the Magnite facelift was snapped at Bharat NCAP's testing facility revealing its front fascia, which features a new radiator grille and a reworked chin. The Magnite facelift will look a tad bit sharper than the outgoing model.

      "# [MGNI: Is Magnite a Top Pick in Digital Advertising? by StockNews.com Staff on 2024-07-07](https://stocknews.com/news/mgni-nexn-crto-tbla-is-magnite-a-top-pick-in-digital-advertising/)\nThe digital advertising landscape is expanding rapidly as consumers spend more time online. Brands are fiercely competing for attention across websites, social media platforms, and mobile apps. This competition has driven a surge in digital ad spending, with the global market projected to exceed $1.37 trillion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 9.6% from 2024 to 2033.\n\nShould investors seeking a slice of this growing pie consider investing in Magnite, Inc. (MGNI)? Valued at a $1.89 billion market cap, the company operates a prominent independent sell-side advertising platform, connecting publishers with advertisers. It provides access to premium ad spaces across the web, mobile apps, Connected TV (CTV), and audio.\n\nMGNI exceeded Wall Street’s expectations in the first quarter with strong top and bottom-line results. Contribution ex-TAC for CTV significantly surpassed the high end of their guidance range, reaching $130.60 million, up 12% year-over-year. Moreover, their CTV segment saw an 18% year-over-year rise to $54.89 million, while DV+ grew 9% to $75.70 million.\n\nMichael G. Barrett, President and CEO of MGNI, commented, “We finished the quarter with strong CTV upside in live sports, related to March Madness, as well as strong continued growth in ad serving, both contributing to share gains. DV+ also posted strong results with growth of 9%.”\n\n“A positive ad spend environment to start 2024, plus our share gains, have led to a great start to the year, and we remain optimistic this momentum will continue. There is a clear trend to consolidation in our space, and we believe the strongest, technically superior, scaled players that deliver the best monetization, will capture market share gains,” he added.\n\nShares of MGNI have gained 81.1% over the past nine months and 44.9% year-to-date, closing the last trading session at $13.53. However, the stock has dipped marginally over the past month.\n\nLet’s look at factors that could influence MGNI’s performance in the upcoming months.\n\nRecent Strategic Partnership\n\n10 STOCKS TO SELL NOW!\n\nOn June 18, the company announced an expanded partnership with Spectrum Reach, the advertising sales arm of Charter Communications, Inc. This partnership enhances programmatic ad-buying access across Spectrum Reach’s vast library of premium linear and streaming TV inventory.\n\nThe agreement extends MGNI’s full programmatic capabilities to Spectrum’s latest video delivery technology, allowing ad buyers to bid on individual impressions in real time. Additionally, ad buyers will benefit from centralized planning and frequency management across linear and digital platforms.\n\nIn March, MGNI and Mediaocean announced an exclusive partnership to enhance automation and supply path efficiency for connected TV (CTV) and online video (OLV) advertising. This partnership allows Mediaocean’s Prisma buyers to directly activate streaming campaigns with premium video sellers through MGNI’s ClearLine solution. It builds on their 2023 deal, which integrated Magnite’s streaming inventory into Mediaocean’s ad infrastructure for local TV buyers.\n\nMixed Financials\n\nFor the first quarter that ended March 31, 2024, MGNI’s revenue increased 14.7% year-over-year to $149.32 million, beating the analysts’ revenue estimate of $124.16 million. Its adjusted EBITDA rose 7.2% from the year-ago value to $26.03 million. Its non-GAAP net income grew 38.8% from the previous year’s quarter to $7.98 million. Furthermore, the company’s adjusted EPS came in at $0.05, up 25% year-over-year.\n\nHowever, its loss from operations for the quarter was $13.83 million. The company’s cash outflow from operating activities amounted to $60.41 million, up 95.5% from $30.89 million in the year-ago period. Also, as of March 31, 2024, MTDR’s cash and cash equivalents decreased to $252.83 million, compared to $326.22 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\nFavorable Analyst Expectations\n\nAnalysts expect MGNI’s revenue and EPS for the second quarter (ended June 2024) to grow 6.9% and 72.1% year-over-year to $144.10 million and $0.15, respectively. Moreover, the company surpassed consensus EPS and revenue estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, which is remarkable.\n\nFor the fiscal year ending December 2024, Street expects MGNI’s revenue to increase 10.6% from the prior year to $607.77 million. The company is expected to post an earnings per share of $0.82, indicating a 52.3% year-over-year growth.\n\nIn addition, the company’s revenue and EPS for the fiscal year 2025 are expected to increase 10.8% and 13.6% year-over-year to $673.57 million and $0.93, respectively.\n\nMixed Valuation\n\nIn terms of forward non-GAAP PEG, MGNI is trading at 0.44x, 68.3% lower than the industry average of 1.37x.\n\nHowever, the stock’s forward EV/Sales and EV/EBITDA multiples of 3.73 and 11.48 are 98.1% and 50.5% above the respective industry averages of 1.88 and 7.63. Likewise, its forward non-GAAP P/E ratio of 16.45x is 29.9% higher than the industry average of 12.66x.\n\nMixed Profitability\n\nMGNI’s trailing-12-month levered FCF margin of 29.61% is 246.1% higher than the 8.56% industry average. Also, the stock’s trailing-12-month Capex/Sales of 4.42% is 22% higher than the industry average of 3.62%.\n\nHowever, its trailing-12-month EBITDA margin of 11.89% is 36.3% lower than the industry average of 18.65%. MGNI’s trailing-12-month net income margin and ROCE of negative 12.24% and negative 11.17% compares to the respective industry averages of 2.87% and 3.56%.\n\nPOWR Ratings Reflect Uncertainty\n\nMGNI’s mixed fundamentals are reflected in its POWR Ratings. The stock has an overall rating of C, which translates to Neutral in our proprietary rating system. The POWR Ratings are calculated by taking into account 118 different factors, with each factor weighted to an optimal degree.\n\nOur proprietary rating system also evaluates each stock based on eight distinct categories. MGNI has earned a B grade for Sentiment, consistent with optimistic analyst estimates.\n\nHowever, the stock has a C grade for Value and Quality, in sync with its mixed valuation and profit margins. Also, MGNI has a D grade for Stability, justified by its five-year beta of 2.34.\n\nWithin the B-rated Advertising industry, MGNI is ranked #8 out of 16 stocks.\n\nBeyond what I have stated above, we have also given MGNI grades for Growth and Momentum. Get all MGNI ratings here.\n\nBottom Line\n\nMGNI showed resilience in the first quarter of 2024, surpassing revenue expectations and demonstrating growth in adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income. This performance underscores its solid position in the digital advertising space, especially with its strategic partnerships aimed at enhancing programmatic ad-buying efficiency.\n\nHowever, the company reported a loss from operations and a substantial increase in cash outflow from operating activities compared to the previous year, reflecting challenges in managing costs and cash flow.\n\nWhile Magnite’s initiatives to enhance programmatic ad-buying capabilities and expand into connected TV are promising, the stock’s high volatility and current valuation suggest caution for potential investors. Given these mixed signals, waiting for a better entry point in this stock seems prudent.\n\nHow Does Magnite, Inc. (MGNI) Stack Up Against Its Peers?\n\nWhile MGNI has an overall grade of C, equating to a Neutral rating, you may check out these A (Strong Buy) rated stocks within the Advertising industry: Nexxen International Ltd.

      "# [Magnite Continues Steady Growth Powered By Programmatic CTV by Anthony Vargas on 2024-08-08](https://www.adexchanger.com/tv/magnite-continues-steady-growth-powered-by-programmatic-ctv/)\nCTV is where the action is for Magnite.\n\nAlthough the full revenue impact of Magnite’s exclusive SSP partnership with Netflix hasn’t hit yet, simply announcing the deal, which happened in May, “created significant momentum for our business,” Magnite President and CEO Michael Barrett told investors on Wednesday.\n\n“New and existing customers [are] asking us how we can help them move faster into programmatic CTV advertising,” he said.\n\nMagnite’s CTV revenue was $63 million in Q2, up 12% YOY. By contrast, revenue from Magnite’s display and video (DV+) business – which includes everything other than CTV – was $84 million, up 7% YOY.\n\nMagnite’s total Q2 revenue was $147 million, a 9% year-over-year increase, with growth exceeding its guidance.\n\nCTV goes programmatic\n\nThe Netflix deal validates Magnite’s years of effort “to create the world’s leading holistic programmatic CTV platform,” Barrett bragged.\n\nHe also highlighted other recent big wins in the CTV space, including Magnite’s partnership with United Airlines to serve ads across its in-flight entertainment platform and the expansion of Magnite’s now seven-year partnership with Roku.\n\nBeyond these deals, Barrett pointed to three additional drivers of Magnite’s CTV growth: healthy overall ad spend, strength in the CTV ad serving market through its SpringServe ad server and increased programmatic adoption by big-name streaming platforms.\n\nMagnite already works with “just about every big [CTV] player out there,” Barrett said, although he did concede there are some big fish – namely YouTube – it will likely never catch.\n\nLarge streamers getting more involved in programmatic helped offset a slight downturn in CTV CPMs for the quarter, Barrett added.\n\n“We believe these [CPM reductions] are supply-driven by the largest industry players scaling their CTV inventory, and not from a drop-off in demand,” he said. “Volume increases have significantly offset CPM reductions, and we believe these trends of accelerating programmatic adoption will continue.”\n\nPlus, lower prices and more supply makes it easier for smaller buyers to enter the CTV market, which is a win for overall programmatic adoption, Barrett said.\n\nThe line on ClearLine\n\nBarrett also offered a few updates on ClearLine, Magnite’s self-serve direct buying solution for CTV, but didn’t share any hard numbers about that part of its business.\n\nClearLine, he said, is “continuing to gain adoption, and we are seeing very good growth, albeit off of a small base,” thanks to traction with agencies and brands that are in “testing and early development.”\n\nBarrett named Roku as a key early adopter of ClearLine and added that Magnite will begin launching ClearLine campaigns in partnership with omnichannel ad platform Mediaocean this coming quarter.\n\nCookie crumbs\n\nBut while much was said about CTV, Magnite didn’t offer much insight into what’s going on with its DV+ business.\n\nBarrett attributed DV+’s 7% YOY growth to Magnite scaling inventory, improving efficiency through traffic shaping and investing in podcast ad formats and digital out-of-home.\n\nHe also alluded to efforts to improve monetization and performance through the use of AI, such as the fully automated Prebid wrapper optimization feature the company added to its Demand Manager publisher tech offering last week. However, it’s unlikely such a new product is generating much revenue yet.\n\nIn response to an investor who inquired about DV+’s Q2 growth rate lagging behind Q1’s 9%, Barrett noted that “there’s always some volatility in the DV+ line.” He added that mobile experienced lighter than usual growth in the quarter, “but nothing to point a finger at.”\n\nBut speaking of volatility, Magnite accentuated the positives of Google backpedaling on its plans to phase out third-party cookies for all Chrome users. The decision should relieve short-term uncertainty around display CPMs, Barrett said.\n\nAnd Magnite doesn’t consider its investment in testing Google’s cookie alternative, the Privacy Sandbox, to be a sunk cost. “We are prepared to support Privacy Sandbox or a future iteration of it,” Barrett said, “for those that may want it.”",

      "# [Nissan Magnite Facelift Interiors Teased – Ahead Of 4th Oct Launch by Akshay Kulkarni on 2024-09-30](https://www.rushlane.com/nissan-magnite-facelift-interiors-teased-ahead-of-4th-oct-launch-12507598.html)\nRivals to upcoming Nissan Magnite Facelift include Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Mahindra XUV3XO, Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet and Renault Kiger\n\nThe sub 4m SUV segment is currently dominated by Tata Motors With Punch and Nexon. Renault Nissan alliance have been targeting both these vehicles with Kiger and Magnite. Fast forwarding to October 2024, Nissan is on the verge of launching Magnite facelift on October 4th and teased interiors ahead of launch. Let’s take a look.\n\nNissan Magnite Facelift Interiors\n\nCompeting in the highly competitive sub 4m SUV space, Nissan Magnite has a tough job on its hands. When we take sales prospect, Nissan Magnite stayed below the top ten in the charts, holding its ground at 11th spot with 2,527 units sold in August 2024. The company aims to boost sales with a facelift ahead of the festive season.\n\nThat’s where the soon to launch facelift comes into action. Ahead of 4th October launch, Nissan has been dropping a few teasers. The most recent teaser shows Magnite facelift’s interiors. Starting with the interior colour theme, Nissan’s new teaser reminds me of Magnite SUV Concept which was first revealed exactly four years ago. Instead of the bright Red highlights, Nissan has used what looks like Orange or Tan or Camel shade.\n\nWe can see the same on dashboard and door panels. Seats get a lighter shade of this contrasting colour in a dual-tone appeal with Black. We can also see Orange or Tan stitching on steering wheel for contrast. Overall Lamborghini-like interior layout looks similar to current model. The grab handles on door panels get new interesting patterns for stylistic appeal.\n\nDashboard and door panels look like they have stitching on them, suggesting a soft-touch finish, to uplift overall cabin ambience of Magnite facelift. Speaking of cabin ambience, there is ambient lighting on dashboard and door panels. Steering is all-black, this time around, and centre console looks similar too.\n\nFeatures upgrade?\n\nOn the outside, we can expect Nissan Magnite facelift to get new bumpers at the front and rear along with a larger grill. Most of the sheet metal might remain identical to keep costs in check. Alloy wheel design is new and LED projector headlight with LED indicators and fog lights are likely to be carried.\n\nAlso carried over, will be auto AC, rear AC vents, front and rear armrest, passive keyless entry and push-button start, large infotainment with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, TFT instrument cluster and more. We hope it gets front ventilated seats, auto headlights, rain-sensing wipers, 360-degree camera, auto-dimming IRVM and others.\n\nPowertrains-wise, we don’t expect any changes. So, the 1.0L 3-cylinder may continue to be offered in naturally-aspirated and turbocharged format with 5-speed manual and CVT gearbox options as current model.",

The carmaker has not disclosed the booking amount, but deliveries for the updated Nissan Magnite will commence post-October 5. The new Nissan Magnite will see changes and here’s what to expect.\n\n2024 Nissan Magnite facelift — What to expect?\n\nWhile Nissan has not revealed the new Magnite yet, the company has released teaser images, revealing some crucial design changes. The most obvious is the alloy wheel design, which now gets a 6-spoke design, while the front grille and lighting setup have also changed, along with tweaked front and rear bumpers.\n\nInside, the new Nissan Magnite gets a black and orange combination, and with the inserts, an update is seen compared to the model it replaces.

      "# [Why Magnite Stock Rocketed Higher on Thursday by Danny Vena, www.facebook.com on 2024-05-16](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/05/16/why-magnite-stock-skyrocketed-thursday-morning/)\nShares of Magnite (MGNI -3.68%) charged sharply higher Thursday morning, surging as much as 31.4%. As of 11:53 a.m. ET, the stock was still up 30.5%.\n\nThe catalyst that sent the adtech specialist soaring was a new big-name ad partner.\n\nMillions of new ad watchers\n\nAt the ad industry upfronts -- the annual advertising sales event for television and streaming platforms -- Netflix (NFLX 0.70%) dropped several nuggets that made waves. First, the company revealed that its less expensive ad-supported tier has quickly grown to 40 million global accounts just 18 months after its debut. Even more surprising, the tally is up from 23 million in January.\n\nPerhaps more importantly to Magnite, Netflix said it planned to unveil its own advertising platform and will no longer rely on Microsoft's technology. As part of that move, Netflix announced that beginning this summer, the company will make its ad supply available to several programmatic ad partners, including Magnite and The Trade Desk, fully launching its platform in the U.S. by the second quarter of 2025.\n\nA sizable opportunity\n\nSeveral analysts have already weighed in on the deal. Benchmark notes that \"Netflix could become Magnite's largest customer by the end of 2025.\" The firm reiterated its buy rating and $18 price target, which represents potential upside of 84% compared to Wednesday's closing price. It also called Magnite a \"best idea\" for 2024.\n\nInvestment firm Craig-Hallum is even more bullish, maintaining its buy rating and boosting its price target to $20. This represents potential gains for investors of 104% compared to Wednesday's close. The analysts cited Magnite's exclusive partnership with Disney, noting that the Netflix deal represents another huge vote of confidence.\n\nHeading into the announcement, despite a rebound in the advertising market, Magnite shares were actually down 8% over the past year. A combination of slow revenue growth and lack of profits have weighed on the stock, but Wall Street and investors alike are viewing this announcement as a turning point for Magnite.",

Analyst Daniel Kurnos also argued that it was \"highly unlikely\" that Disney would build a full end-to-end stack without Magnite.\n\nCraig-Hallum and Needham also said that the sell-off creates a buying opportunity for Magnite.\n\nWhat it means for Magnite\n\nAn 11% decline might seem excessive, considering the news seems partly speculative at this point, and the implications aren't fully understood.\n\nLike other adtech stocks, Magnite has struggled in the aftermath of the pandemic, as the earlier boom in digital advertising has given way to slower growth and less enthusiasm among investors.\n\nMagnite is still struggling to accelerate its growth, as revenue was up just 7% in the second quarter. With or without the Disney setback, the company will have to improve on that number in order for the stock to be a winner.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Magnite right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Magnite, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Magnite wasn’t one of them.

Over 40% of all signups in the ads countries now come from the ads plan.\n\nNetflix also featured new partners that advertisers can use to measure and verify the impact of their campaigns, including Affinity Solutions, DoubleVerify, EDO Inc, Integral Ad Science, iSpotTV, Kantar, Lucid, NCSolutions, Nielsen and TVision.\n\nNew Ad Tech\n\nLooking ahead, Reinhard announced Netflix will launch an in-house advertising technology platform, by the end of 2025. This will give advertisers new ways to buy, new insights to leverage, and new ways to measure impact.\n\n“Bringing our ad tech in-house will allow us to power the ads plan with the same level of excellence that’s made Netflix the leader in streaming technology today,” she said.\n\nThis summer, Netflix will also expand its buying capabilities to include The Trade Desk, Google's Display & Video 360, and Magnite who will join Microsoft as the main programmatic partners for advertisers.\n\nAll of these enhancements are designed to make Netflix even better for clients. \"We’re being incredibly strategic about how we present ads because we want our members to have a phenomenal experience. We conduct deep consumer research to make sure we stay ahead of the competition, bringing opportunities that are better for members and better for brands,” said Reinhard.\n\nEngagement\n\nAs Bela Bajaria, Netflix's Chief Content Officer, explained, “Our audiences are highly engaged — and by engaged I mean that they are choosing to spend their time watching Netflix. That’s important because engagement is the key to success in streaming. When people watch our shows and movies, they get more value from Netflix, they stick around longer, and they’re more likely to recommend us to their friends. And this matters to all of you because you want to be where the audiences are, too.”\n\nAccording to Nielsen, over the last three years, Netflix had more top 10 titles than every other streaming service combined.\n\nOver 70% of Netflix’s ad-supported members watch for more than 10 hours a month — which is 15 percentage points higher than the nearest competitor, according to Nielsen. Netflix members also pay even more attention three hours into watching than they do when they first start. And because they do, they’re around twice as likely to respond to an ad compared to other streaming services and linear TV.\n\nNew Series, Movies and Live Events\n\nBajaria also talked about how Netflix needs a variety of quality shows,movies and live events that members will love throughout the year — across many, many genres, cultures and languages. And that’s exactly what they’ll get in 2024 and 2025.\n\nNetflix announced new series, including witty comedies like Golf, starring Will Ferrell and executive produced by Ramy Youseff and Rian Johnson, and Running Point, starring Kate Hudson and executive produced by Mindy Kaling.\n\nTwo new dramas will also be coming to Netflix: The Waterfront from Kevin Williamson, an adult family drama set in a small coastal town with twists and turns inspired by true events, and a contemporary cowboy saga starring Tim McGraw. And, Bajaria announced that the critically acclaimed series 3 Body Problem will also be back for all new episodes.\n\nFor sports fans, Netflix highlighted multiple new shows, including a new documentary series following the story of Jerry Jones and the 1990s Dallas Cowboys, and three series in partnership with the International Olympic Committee: Simone Biles: Rising which will follow the comeback of the greatest gymnast ever, a show spotlighting men’s basketball teams from around the world as they compete for medals, and Sprint, tracking the 100-meter sprinters.\n\nNew films announced include Happy Gilmore 2 starring Adam Sandler, The Woman in Cabin 10 based on the bestselling novel of the same name and starring Keira Knightley, and a new film from Academy Award® winner Kathryn Bigelow.\n\nAnd the NFL is coming to Netflix. That’s right, Netflix will be the global home of the NFL’s two Christmas Day marquee games this year. And we’ll be streaming at least one Christmas Day game in 2025 and 2026.\n\nThe Netflix Effect\n\nNetflix Chief Marketing Officer Marian Lee shared how Netflix shows and films influence culture — a phenomenon that has become known as the Netflix Effect. “It starts with wonderful stories that become unmissable moments for millions of fans,” Lee said. “But then it spreads across Netflix — where our trailers get billions of views — and across our social media channels, where we have a billion very active followers.”\n\nThe Netflix ads plan and live events now give advertisers even more opportunities to thoughtfully engage with this fandom, leveraging its growing marketing and creative teams to help more brands find a home in their world. “We’ll help you reach more fans and give you more access on-screen, off-screen, and during some of our biggest moments,” Lee said.\n\nAs an example of one of these new opportunities, the company announced that Celsius will be the first presenting sponsor for the upcoming live Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson event this July. Brand partners for the fight will have featured placements throughout the broadcast and customized branding inside the ring.\n\nClosing the presentation, Peter Naylor, Vice President of Advertising Sales, said, “There’s a lot to be excited about over the next year. But the story of ads on Netflix this year is pretty simple: It’s about growth and momentum.”\n\nThe Netflix Experience\n\nThis year, Netflix unveiled an interactive Upfront experience showcasing popular titles like Bridgerton, Squid Game, Wednesday and more for advertisers to engage with.\n\nUpcoming 2024 Slate Highlights:\n\nReturning Favorites\n\nArcane S2 - Award winning animated series\n\nCobra Kai S6 - Critics’ Choice award winning action comedy series\n\nThe Diplomat S2 - Golden Globe nominated drama series\n\nEmily in Paris S4 - Emmy nominated romantic comedy-drama series\n\nHeartstopper S3 - BAFTA nominated coming-of-age series\n\nMo S2 - Final season of award winning drama series\n\nOuter Banks S4 - People’s Choice award winning drama series\n\nSquid Game S2 - Emmy® award winning Korean drama series\n\nSweet Tooth S3 - Final season of Emmy award winning family drama series\n\nThe Umbrella Academy S4 - Final season of Emmy nominated drama series\n\nUnstable S2 - Comedy series starring Rob Lowe\n\nVikings Valhalla S3 - Historical drama series\n\nNew Prestige Dramas\n\nAmerican Primeval - Action-thriller western limited series directed by Pete Berg\n\nBlack Doves - Keira Knightley and Ben Whishaw star in spy thriller\n\nEric - Limited thriller series starring Emmy award winner Benedict Cumberbatch\n\nKAOS - Greek mythology twisted drama starring Jeff Goldblum\n\nThe Madness - Conspiracy thriller starring Emmy award winner Colman Domingo\n\nMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story - Second installment of Ryan Murphy’s Monster anthology series\n\nThe Perfect Couple - Book adaptation of Elin Hilderbrand’s New York Times bestseller\n\nSupacell - Superhero series written and directed by Andrew Onwubolu\n\nNew Comedy Series\n\nA Classic Spy - Based on the 2020 documentary The Mole Agent, starring Ted Danson\n\nThe Decameron - Comedy series from creator and showrunner Kathleen Jordan\n\nNo Good Deed - Starring Emmy award-winning actors Lisa Kudrow and Ray Romano\n\nNobody Wants This - Romantic comedy starring Kristen Bell and Adam Brody [Download first look photo HERE.]\n\nRunning Point - Starring Kate Hudson [Download first look photos HERE.]\n\nNew Unscripted Series\n\nAMERICA’S SWEETHEARTS: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders - New series about the most iconic franchise in cheerleading\n\nRhythm & Flow S2 - Hit music competition series returns with new hosts DJ Khaled, Ludacris and Latto\n\nNew Premium Documentaries\n\nHomicide: Los Angeles - Docuseries from the mind of Law & Order creator Dick Wolf (preceded by Homicide: New York which premiered earlier this year)\n\nOur Oceans - Produced by Freeborne Media, Wild Space Productions\n\nUntitled K Pop doc series - Docuseries about the rigorous process of making a global music sensation\n\nNew Sports Series\n\nReceiver - From the creators of Quarterback, the series follows pass-catchers during the NFL 2023-24 season\n\nUntitled 2004 Red Sox Series - A look at the historic 2004 Red Sox season that culminated with one of the greatest comebacks in sports.\n\nNew Live Events\n\nJake Paul vs. Mike Tyson - Heavyweight boxing mega-event sanctioned as a professional fight\n\nSelect Upcoming Films\n\nAtlas - Jennifer Lopez stars in the sci-fi action thriller\n\nBack in Action - Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz star in this action comedy stars [Download first look photos HERE]\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F - Eddie Murphy returns to the iconic franchise\n\nCarry-On - Taron Egerton and Jason Bateman star in this action thriller\n\nFamily Affair - Nicole Kidman and Zac Efron star in this romantic comedy\n\nHit Man - Glen Powell leads Richard Linklater’s steamy dark comedy\n\nHot Frosty - Lacey Chabert stars in this holiday rom-com\n\nThe Merry Gentleman - Chad Michael Murray stars in this holiday rom-com\n\nThe Piano Lesson - Film adaptation of the award-winning play starring Samuel L.

(NASDAQ: MGNI) is the world's largest independent sell-side advertising platform, providing technology solutions for publishers to monetize their digital advertising inventory across various formats, including Connected TV (CTV), online video, display, and audio. The company was formerly known as The Rubicon Project, Inc. and rebranded to Magnite in July 2020.

The company has a market capitalization of approximately $1.68 billion, with a trailing revenue of $649.22 million and a net income loss of $5.4 million [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/).\n\n## Financial Performance\nMagnite's financial performance has shown mixed results. In Q2 2024, the company reported a revenue of $162.9 million, a 7% increase year-over-year, with a contribution ex-TAC of $146.8 million, up 9% year-over-year [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/). However, the company also reported a loss of $1.1 million for the quarter, indicating ongoing challenges in achieving profitability [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/).\n\nDespite these challenges, analysts have noted a positive outlook for Magnite, with expectations for revenue growth of 10.6% in the fiscal year ending December 2024, reaching approximately $607.77 million [(StockNews.com, 2024)](https://stocknews.com/news/mgni-nexn-crto-tbla-is-magnite-a-top-pick-in-digital-advertising/). The stock has seen significant volatility, with a year-to-date gain of approximately 44.9% as of the latest reports [(StockNews.com, 2024)](https://stocknews.com/news/mgni-nexn-crto-tbla-is-magnite-a-top-pick-in-digital-advertising/).\n\n## Recent Developments\n### Partnerships and Acquisitions\nMagnite has been active in forming strategic partnerships to enhance its offerings. Notably, the company announced a partnership with **TF1 PUB**, a leading French video advertising network, to leverage Magnite's technology for programmatic advertising solutions [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/news/). Additionally, **Blitz**, a gaming analytics platform, has chosen Magnite as its preferred supply-side platform (SSP) to streamline its programmatic strategy [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/news/).\n\nIn a significant move, Magnite secured a partnership with **Netflix**, which is expected to enhance its CTV advertising capabilities. This partnership allows Magnite to access Netflix's ad supply, potentially making it one of Magnite's largest customers by the end of 2025 [(The Motley Fool, 2024)](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/05/16/why-magnite-stock-skyrocketed-thursday-morning/).\n\n### Financial Maneuvers\nOn September 18, 2024, Magnite successfully completed a term loan repricing, reducing its interest rate by 75 basis points, which is expected to save the company over $2.7 million in annual interest payments [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/news/). This financial maneuver is part of Magnite's strategy to improve its financial health amid ongoing operational losses.\n\n## Product Overview\nMagnite's platform offers a comprehensive suite of tools for both publishers and advertisers. The company's technology enables publishers to manage and monetize their digital advertising inventory effectively, while providing advertisers with access to high-quality ad spaces across various channels. The platform supports billions of advertising transactions each month, emphasizing its scale and reach in the digital advertising ecosystem [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/).\n\n### Innovations and Technology\nMagnite has been at the forefront of integrating advanced technologies into its offerings. The company has partnered with **KERV Interactive** to deliver AI-powered interactive video ads, enhancing audience engagement and driving performance for advertisers [(KERV Interactive, 2024)](https://www.magnite.com/press/kerv-interactive-partners-with-magnite-to-deliver-ai-powered-interactive-video-ads-programmatically-at-scale/). Additionally, Magnite's **SpringServe** ad server is designed specifically for CTV and video advertising, providing better insights and control for advertisers [(TELUS Communications, 2024)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magnite-chosen-as-the-preferred-technology-partner-to-enhance-telus-connected-tv-offering-302191700.html).\n\n## Executive Insights\nMichael G. Barrett, President and CEO of Magnite, has expressed optimism about the company's growth trajectory, particularly in the CTV segment. He noted, \"A positive ad spend environment to start 2024, plus our share gains, have led to a great start to the year, and we remain optimistic this momentum will continue\" [(StockNews.com, 2024)](https://stocknews.com/news/mgni-nexn-crto-tbla-is-magnite-a-top-pick-in-digital-advertising/). This sentiment reflects the company's strategic focus on expanding its CTV capabilities and enhancing programmatic ad-buying efficiency.\n\n## Market Position and Challenges\nDespite its leading position in the adtech space, Magnite faces challenges, including competition from larger players and the need to improve profitability. The company's stock has experienced fluctuations, with recent reports indicating a decline following concerns about its relationship with Disney and potential impacts on revenue from key partnerships [(The Globe and Mail, 2024)](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/markets-news/Motley%20Fool/28829585/why-magnite-stock-was-falling-today/). Analysts have suggested that while there are risks, the long-term outlook remains positive due to the growing demand for programmatic advertising solutions.\n\n## Conclusion\nMagnite, Inc. stands as a significant player in the digital advertising landscape, with a robust platform and strategic partnerships that position it for future growth. However, potential investors and candidates should consider the company's mixed financial performance and the competitive challenges it faces in the evolving adtech market. As Magnite continues to innovate and expand its offerings, it remains a company to watch in the digital advertising sector."
