I understand the concepts, theoretical and practical, but one thing you can only build with experience is where you rank certain platforms. Most likely, we'll bring someone onto my team for programmatic or go with an agency, but I'd at least like to know what the best DSP platforms for our needs are, as well as which ones to avoid. \n\nWe're mostly looking at advertising on streaming platforms, music and tv/film. \n\nFor context:\n\n\\- We are in health services, specifically urgent care. We also offer primary care and have a line of pediatric care clinics which will likely be the focus of our programmatic advertising (mostly mothers of kids under 11)  \n\\- Main uses will be for platforms like Spotify/Pandora and streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, etc.  \n\\- We have \\~60 locations, mostly in rural areas  \n\\- Budget is fat  \n\\- The head of the department is awesome, mostly because they're me\n\n## Comment ID kgsul3l with +5 score by [(3EsandPaul, Reddit, 2024-01-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1911gd7/best_dsp_for_a_chain_of_urgent_care_clinics_for/kgsul3l/) (in reply to ID 1911gd7):\nBasis or StackAdapt\n\n## Comment ID kgs5gcc with +9 score by [(JimmyTango, Reddit, 2024-01-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1911gd7/best_dsp_for_a_chain_of_urgent_care_clinics_for/kgs5gcc/) (in reply to ID 1911gd7):\nMost major platforms will want a monthly minimum spend, say $50kish per month. Choozle used to be no minimum but I’m not sure what their latest system is. StackAdapt might be worth a look, they play strongly in the local space, not sure how strong their CTV offering is. \n\nNetflix can only be bought via Xandr DSP right now and only as programmatic guarantee. Not sure it makes sense for you with such a local focus as inventory is limited as is targeting.  \n\nWhy not go with a regional agency who might already have access to these platforms?\n\n## Comment ID kgs59zn with +4 score by [(Publish_Lice, Reddit, 2024-01-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1911gd7/best_dsp_for_a_chain_of_urgent_care_clinics_for/kgs59zn/) (in reply to ID 1911gd7):\nDon’t pulsepoint specialise in medical area?\n\n### Comment ID kgs6fje with +6 score by [(sarries123, Reddit, 2024-01-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1911gd7/best_dsp_for_a_chain_of_urgent_care_clinics_for/kgs6fje/) (in reply to ID kgs59zn):\nPulsepoint and DeepIntent both do\n\n#### Comment ID kgxzgo9 with +1 score by [(al-j-, Reddit, 2024-01-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1911gd7/best_dsp_for_a_chain_of_urgent_care_clinics_for/kgxzgo9/) (in reply to ID kgs6fje):\nThey are much more if you are pharma though and not this type of client-\n\n## Comment ID kgtfuul with +4 score by [(arkitector, Reddit, 2024-01-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1911gd7/best_dsp_for_a_chain_of_urgent_care_clinics_for/kgtfuul/) (in reply to ID 1911gd7):\nI work for a healthcare org and we use StackAdapt for CTV and contextual display.

TTD has prenegotiated deals with most major streaming/ctv/audio publishers. Additionally you want strong reach and graph capabilities in the rural areas along with large data selection which is possible with TTD. The main caveat would be meeting TTD minimums but you could go through a good reseller.\n\n## Comment ID kgsa73e with +1 score by [(OrdinaryInside8, Reddit, 2024-01-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1911gd7/best_dsp_for_a_chain_of_urgent_care_clinics_for/kgsa73e/) (in reply to ID 1911gd7):\nRoku perhaps? TTD is good but you’ll have to hit minimum monthly thresholds. Stackadapt is no fee but limited features. Deepintent is healthcare specific, but I think they’re fairly smoke and mirrors. Whatever you do, look for someone who has some measurement and attribution capabilities.\n\n### Comment ID ky68scb with +1 score by [(Fragrant-Locksmith-9, Reddit, 2024-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1911gd7/best_dsp_for_a_chain_of_urgent_care_clinics_for/ky68scb/) (in reply to ID kgsa73e):\nHi u/OrdinaryInside8 can you elaborate more on DeepIntent?

Right now, I'm working with VDO.AI and Google Ad Manager (GAM) using VAST tags, as they integrate well with IMA SDK. However, I’m seeing mixed reviews about VDO.AI and wondering if there are better alternatives. The estimated CPM I got was around $1-2 which seems low considering I'm hosting my own videos. Since YouTube ads offer a similar range ($1-3 CPM), I'd love to hear recommendations for other companies that provide VAST tags with better rates.\n\n## Comment ID mjsev48 with +2 score by [(Fearless-Dagger, Reddit, 2025-03-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/1jir42k/ctv_monetization_vdoai_alternatives/mjsev48/) (in reply to ID 1jir42k):\nWas thinking of switching too, but my CPMs are rebounding this week.

If you’re applying for in house roles with just 2 years experience, you’re going to be going against people with more experience. Not saying it can’t be done, but just curb your expectations.\n\nMy experience applying for and interviewing for in house roles is that they are less established in their processes and product implementation than an agency role. Being able to evaluate partners and provide POVs is a very valuable skill to set yourself apart. Also, most in house roles I’ve applied for want someone with programmatic, social, and search experience. So your social experience is a good addition.\n\nGood benefits and pay usually come with climbing the career ladder, which is why most people want to climb it.

Some examples of the richer feature set: adaptive/multiplex ads, smart refresh, interactive ads, dynamic floors optimized by AI, bidder optimization per GEO/device/website, traffic shaping, timeout optimization per GEO/device/website, anti-malvertising, auto-in-content units, asynchronous ad loading, adblock revenue recovery, multi-platform & flexible ad sizes support...

Kia is sitting there with Sonet which has the interior quality from two segments above, but Kiger is there with rattly plastic. Your average 10L spending customer is no longer interested in products that feels cheaper and hence why you see Nissan do the sensible thing and improve the interior of the Magnite even if they haven't made any substantial change.\n\nAs an example, when I was buying a small hatch, I actually looked at amaze, it's a very superior car for my purpose. But, I couldn't sell it to my family because of the lacklustre Honda sales reception, the bare-bones interiors, colour choices and to a large extent a dull test ride. What I am noticing obviously is as people's quality of life and financial potential improves, they are looking for good presentation, especially when they are shelling out on big products.\n\nAll the things said above magnifies dramatically once they look at a product line from Hyundai, Kia and even Tata and Mahindra in this price range. You can Kiger is a solid 1L or 2L cheaper, but when people look at Venue they will check out the i20 and even the bottom segment i10 grand nios. It all feels very premium and well put together, and not like they are being sold something cheap with compromises. When you go to the Tata or Mahindra, your family will check out the XUV 700 and Harriers. They would rather buy something that's a segment below from a brand that offers Harrier than a showroom that's sitting there with one car that doesn't feel as premium.\n\nSo, they have to bring the products quality to at least the old Duster level to survive in the market, then the service and sales experience factors in.\n\n### Comment ID lshx9rn with +4 score by [(sid3091, Reddit, 2024-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lshx9rn/) (in reply to ID lsbnsqh):\n> Your average 10L spending customer is no longer interested in products that feels\n\nYou're not getting a sonet at 10 lacs, my guy.

In fact, if I'm spending on one as a beater next, I would buy the second to base trim since it has the important two things I look for in a car, a decent infotainment system and rear camera. It also comes kitted with front parking sensor and auto headlamps; hence why you see a lot of people buying the HTK and HTK+. And the important part is they don't feel like a downgraded version in terms of trim quality, and you can be confident they won't start rattling after a few years.\n\nBut what I meant by 10L spending customer is just people who are ready to spend past 10L and go up to 15L.\n\n## Comment ID lsbt0xv with +9 score by [(WhyAmIHere0025, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lsbt0xv/) (in reply to ID 1g5jgwc):\nTbf, a lot of good cars don’t do well in India, our market has requirements that most people abroad do not care about much, ‘kitna deti hai?’, sunroofs etc.\nEfficiency obviously makes sense since most people here aren’t exactly that rich, and for a lot of people owning a car is an aspiration or a dream, so obviously they want all the gimmicks like a sunroof and electronics, which is why Hyundais and KIAs sell so well (they are decent cars as well no denying that), so simply getting all the basics right doesn’t sell enough, a brand needs some kind of USP for word of mouth, Honda offers brand value die to the historical image of the city, the Germans offer driving dynamics, suzuki offers mileage and reliability etc, and the former two still aren’t doing well here, now imagine how would you explain to a neighbour with no knowledge of cars about why they should get a Renault in today’s time?\n\n## Comment ID lsbsbok with +18 score by [(amanbindra94, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lsbsbok/) (in reply to ID 1g5jgwc):\nI own a CVT turbo Kiger and can vouch that it's the most VFM product in the market at that price band.

The non turbo engine sucks and the turbo one is just satisfactory, especially in the AMTs and many city drivers are going towards automatics even at low price points.\n\n2. India has also seen a shift where many people have started at least thinking of Safety in their top 5 requirements. \n\n3. Also Renault has always been seen as a budget brand because their only car that did respectable numbers after the duster is the Kwid. Renault’s fault for not bringing updated Duster in time to take advantage of the booming SUV market despite the fact that Duster could be considered one of the cars that popularised SUVs in city households. \n\n4. The consumer in that price bracket is more concerned with Fuel Efficiency (Maruti’s strength) than with Ride Comfort (Renault’s only redeeming feature) and since neither offers the better safety they go with Maruti/Hyundai.\n\n### Comment ID lsbt5p5 with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lsbt5p5/) (in reply to ID lsbpzvz):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID lshxork with +2 score by [(sid3091, Reddit, 2024-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lshxork/) (in reply to ID lsbt5p5):\n> 3 more bhp at 17 lakhs on road\n\nAnd 20NM less torque :P\n\n## Comment ID lsc53bh with +3 score by [(Thick_Growth_7630, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lsc53bh/) (in reply to ID 1g5jgwc):\n* Noisy engine (Especially when the AC is on)\n* No option for CNG or EV or Hybrid.

It is terrible, unless you're doing live and somehow can manage to qualify for their SSAI integration.   That is next to impossible though.  \n\nPublica and Springserve are what you want.   Beachfront is cool too, Freewheel is great but extremely advanced and hard to get into.   There's a few other options out there.  \n\nYou do need to get separate relationships set up with SSP's though, even if you have accounts at some of them already the CTV account is usually separate.    \n\n\nThere is a learning curve and cost to set up these servers, so you also need to look at how much volume you have and what the real dollar opportunity is for you to make those decisions.     \n\n\nMy company has set a number of people up with Publica and Springserve, so I'm happy to give you information about what it takes, costs, etc.    We do have Publica and relationships with all the major SSP's, so at the very least I can give you some real-world data.\n\n### Comment ID i6qi7kz with +1 score by [(federoll, Reddit, 2022-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/udwrh9/which_ctv_adtech_should_we_use/i6qi7kz/) (in reply to ID i6q2ufv):\nThanks for the detailed explanation.\nI've talked with Publica and they do not have a marketplace and don't have pre-stablished connections with exchanges.\n\nI guess that Spingserve is the same, you have to manually connect with ssps and exchanges.\n\nI found that Smart adserver is more business oriented with their own demand and supply.

      "# Post ID kr2jlk: MGNI, PERI, or PUBM with +26 score by [(SaveThemTurdles, Reddit, 2021-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kr2jlk/mgni_peri_or_pubm/)\nMagnite, Perion Network, and Pubmatic are all digital advertising companies that look poised for growth in the next few years. The demand for digital advertisements has increased due to the growing popularity of streaming services, and I expect this industry to do very well in the next few years. I’d like to know opinions on which of these three companies are best positioned to take advantage of the expanding advertising space. \n\nOverview:\n\n**MGNI - Magnite**\n\nMarket Cap: $3.40 billion \n\nLast Quarter revenue: $60.98 million\n\nEPS: 0.06\n\nMagnite, Inc. operates an independent sell-side advertising platform in the United States and internationally. Its omnichannel advertising platform enables publishers to monetize various auction types and formats, including CTV, desktop display, video, audio, and mobile, as well as allows agencies and brands to access brand-safe ad inventory and execute advertising transactions. The company is based in Los Angeles, California. \n\n**PERI - Perion Network Ltd.**\n\nMarket Cap: $321.21 million\n\nLast quarter revenue: $83.41 million\n\nEPS: 0.08\n\nPerion Network Ltd., a technology company, delivers advertising solutions to brands, agencies, and publishers in North America, Europe, and internationally. The company develops digital advertising solutions to capture consumer attention and drive engagement, as well as delivers ads across a portfolio of Websites and mobile applications. Its proprietary social marketing platform offers a dashboard for marketers that make media buying efficient on Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, and other social networks and platforms. The company's platform allows advertisers to control their marketing expenditures, in-house planning and strategy, and utilize the technical tool to create operational marketing efficiencies. In addition, it provides search-based monetization solutions for publishers with analytics capabilities to track and monitor their business performance; Smilebox that enables people to tell the stories of their lives with customizable eCards, slideshows, invitations, and collages; and IncrediMail a messaging application that enables consumers to manage various email accounts in one place. The company was formerly known as IncrediMail Ltd. and changed its name to Perion Network Ltd. in November 2011. Perion Network Ltd. was incorporated in 1999 and is headquartered in Holon, Israel.\n\n**PUBM - PubMatic, Inc.**\n\nMarket Cap: $1.28 billion\n\nLast quarter earnings: $34.39 million \n\nEPS: 0.25\n\nPubMatic, Inc. provides a cloud infrastructure platform that enables real-time programmatic advertising transactions worldwide. Its platform supports an array of ad formats and digital device types, including mobile app, mobile web, desktop, display, video, over-the-top, connected television, and media. The company was founded in 2006 and is headquartered in Redwood City, California. PubMatic had their IPO in early December 2020. \n\n\nI think all three stocks are good buys, with PERI being the most undervalued at the moment. If anyone has anything to add it would be much appreciated!\n\n## Comment ID gi79byj with +15 score by [(cold-brew-101, Reddit, 2021-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kr2jlk/mgni_peri_or_pubm/gi79byj/) (in reply to ID kr2jlk):\nYou'll want to get into PERI, it is a company that has raised guidance twice this year and is seeing a resurgence in growth.

My only concern is the lack of consistent growth since 2013. Seems like revenue has fluctuated between $20 million and $120 million over the years. May be the reason the stock seems so undervalued at the moment.\n\n#### Comment ID gi7p56e with +3 score by [(mcoclegendary, Reddit, 2021-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kr2jlk/mgni_peri_or_pubm/gi7p56e/) (in reply to ID gi7azlq):\nThe same is true for a lot of the digital advertising companies though.

The only reason to buy Pubmatix is because adtech stocks tend to follow TTD in ups/downs. There is literally nothing unique or special about the company itself - just a cookie cutter SSP that isn’t doing anything noteworthy\n\n### Comment ID gi8stzf with +6 score by [(Cheesepuff_BeanDip, Reddit, 2021-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kr2jlk/mgni_peri_or_pubm/gi8stzf/) (in reply to ID gi7ekbr):\nI work in AdTech also.  MGNI is an industry leader.  PubMatic is just one of the bunch.  I've seen many DSP's temporaily suspend PubMatic inventory paths because of ad fraud scores.

Because of a thing called 'header bidding', most SSPs all tend to sell more or less the same supply as each other though you have some like Triplelift that specialize in native ads (ads that seem more like organic content).\n\nI *think* there's more value in companies like LiveRamp that's a data platform especially as there is continuously growing interest/concern around data privacy but it doesn't really appear to be reflected in their stock price.\n\n### Comment ID gi7hxwu with +3 score by [(2toness, Reddit, 2021-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kr2jlk/mgni_peri_or_pubm/gi7hxwu/) (in reply to ID gi7ekbr):\nWhat is your sentiment on MGNI then?\n\n#### Comment ID gi8t7uj with +5 score by [(Cheesepuff_BeanDip, Reddit, 2021-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kr2jlk/mgni_peri_or_pubm/gi8t7uj/) (in reply to ID gi7hxwu):\nMGNI provides massive ad placement reach/scale, full transparency into their auction process, and also partners with TTD/LiveRamp on forward-thinking projects like Unified ID.  \n\n\nPubMatic is an SSP that I often disable from campaigns I run.  The ads always get \"clicked\" but the clickers rarely take action once they land on sites.  Classic ad fraud.\n\n#### Comment ID gi8zvom with +4 score by [(4ndyp4ndy, Reddit, 2021-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kr2jlk/mgni_peri_or_pubm/gi8zvom/) (in reply to ID gi7hxwu):\nlike u/Cheesepuff_BeanDip mentioned, they're doing some good stuff with Unified ID 2.0. I think they're the first big supply side partner to get involved so points for that. For reference - Unified ID 2.0 is perceived to be very important for the business with cookies and such going away. I have a positive view of their CEO too who's a seasoned adtech vet.\n\nI don't really know their financials or their growth but their stock 4Xing over the past year seems like .... an overvaluation and just riding the coattails of TTD though. They haven't exactly done anything to warrant all that hype but I suppose it's been a huge bull market. There was some excitement a while back about their sole partnership with Hulu but I think that's no longer exclusive to Magnite\n\nIf you're deciding between these though, just dump your money into Magnite or TTD lol.\n\n## Comment ID gi7tmv6 with +5 score by [(play_it_safe, Reddit, 2021-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kr2jlk/mgni_peri_or_pubm/gi7tmv6/) (in reply to ID kr2jlk):\nThere are others, too. \n\nMAX, IBEX, FLNT, BCOV\n\nAlso, you left out the most important part: how much they're growing and future trajectories.\n\n### Comment ID gi7xydc with +3 score by [(SaveThemTurdles, Reddit, 2021-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kr2jlk/mgni_peri_or_pubm/gi7xydc/) (in reply to ID gi7tmv6):\nThanks, Haven’t looked into those yet. \n\nMGNI has the best YOY growth of the three. \n\nPERI has consistent growth over the last three quarters and I think next earnings will continue the trend.

They are all turnaround plays!!!\nIt's not a growth stock!!!\n\nThis seems like a lot of confidence for a company that most recently grew only 12% year over year.\n\nI know the headline ran with 62% growth and some of the financial sites show that 62% as well. But from their own quarterly press release, that is not the actual growth rate. \n\nMagnite revenue was $61.0 million for Q3 2020, up 62% from Q3 2019 on an as reported basis and up 12% on a pro-forma basis\n\nThird quarter 2020 financial results of Magnite represent the combined performance of Rubicon Project and Telaria, which merged on April 1, 2020. Third quarter 2019 comparative numbers do not include results from Telaria, unless noted as pro-forma.\n\nTelaria was around a $15M/quarter company. So the 62% doesn’t take into account nearly 25% of the combined company total revenue into the comparable. And when you look at the comparable it’s only 12% growth for the combined company. \n\nFurther the mobile and desktop grew about 3% YoY. And CTV accounted for $11M and 18% of revenue and grew at 51%. At $11M that should be growing near triple digits to be anywhere near matching the narrative. $11M and 51% are pathetically small numbers for what should be a hypergrowth market. And that CTV growth rate has fallen like a rock every quarter.\n\nThe guidance is similarly weak at $75M at top of guide. The Q4 combined comparable is $68.1M, implying 10-11% growth. Q4 is a seasonally larger quarter for both of the Magnite companies. As typical you can expect Q1 guide to show a decline QoQ. And probably continued 10-12% growth.\n\nAnnual Revenues from the past few years:\n\n2016: 278M\n2017:155M -44% YoY\n2018:124M -20% YoY\n2019: 156M +26% YoY\n\n\nThis is clearly a \"hope for a turnaround\" company and not a high growth company!!!\n\n## Comment ID gkrrz6h with +1 score by [(Aside_Much, Reddit, 2021-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kr2jlk/mgni_peri_or_pubm/gkrrz6h/) (in reply to ID kr2jlk):\nGreat write up!    \nTake a look at Comscore / $SCOR.

      "# Post ID 1d59dkx: Magnite (MGNI): A Hidden Gem with Explosive Potential Due to Low Float and Strong Partnerships with +16 score by [(letitglowbig, Reddit, 2024-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1d59dkx/magnite_mgni_a_hidden_gem_with_explosive/)\nHey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share some compelling reasons why I believe Magnite (MGNI) is set for a strong performance this year and why it's a great time to consider adding it to your portfolio. One particularly interesting dynamic is the extremely low float, combined with recent strategic moves that could make this stock soar. Here’s a detailed breakdown:\n\n# 1. Strong Financial Performance\n\nMagnite recently reported Q1 2024 revenue of $149.3 million, a 15% increase from the previous year, and significantly higher than analyst expectations of $124.24 million. Their Contribution ex-TAC also grew by 12% to $111.1 million, indicating strong operational efficiency and market demand.\n\n# 2. Strategic Netflix Partnership\n\nMagnite has secured a key partnership with Netflix, becoming a primary partner for their ad-supported tier. This deal not only boosts Magnite’s revenue potential but also validates its technology and market position. As streaming services grow, especially ad-supported models, this partnership will be crucial.\n\n# 3. Growth in CTV\n\nConnected TV (CTV) revenue grew 18% year-over-year to $55 million. With more consumers shifting to streaming, Magnite is well-positioned to capture increasing ad spend in the CTV space, further enhanced by the Netflix deal.\n\n# 4. Election Year Boost\n\n2024 is a presidential election year, and political ad spending is expected to hit new highs. Previous cycles have shown substantial increases, and 2024 is projected to see digital and CTV ad spending grow exponentially, benefiting companies like Magnite that are well-positioned in these markets.\n\n# 5. Analyst Confidence\n\nAnalysts have issued strong buy ratings and optimistic price targets for MGNI, reflecting confidence in the company’s strategic direction and growth opportunities.\n\n# 6. Institutional Ownership\n\nA whopping 90.01% of MGNI shares are held by institutions, with significant holdings by Vanguard (9.15%), RTL US Holding Inc (8.84%), and BlackRock (7.16%). Additionally, 3.70% of shares are held by employees and C-suite executives, indicating strong long-term confidence and stability.\n\n# 7. Low Float\n\nMagnite has an extraordinarily low float, with only about 8.8 million shares available for individual investors. This is due to the high institutional ownership (90.01%) and insider holdings (3.70%). Such a low float scenario is uncommon and presents a unique opportunity.\n\nWhen a stock has a low float, it means there are fewer shares available for trading. This limited supply can lead to significant price volatility, especially if demand for the stock increases. In the case of Magnite, the recent Netflix partnership and strong financial performance are likely to attract more individual investors. With only a small number of shares available for trading, even a moderate increase in buying interest can drive the stock price up sharply.\n\nThe low float scenario is not typical for most stocks, making this a unique situation. When combined with high institutional confidence and insider ownership, it suggests that those who know the company best believe in its long-term potential. For retail investors, this creates an opening to capitalize on a stock that could see rapid appreciation as more people become aware of its strengths and begin to buy shares.\n\n# 8. Increased Attention\n\nHistorically, MGNI has been a relatively unknown stock with a 30-day volume SMA of 2.17 million shares. However, the Netflix deal has brought new attention from individual investors. With the limited float and increased interest, there’s a strong potential for significant price movement as more investors jump in.\n\n# 9. Short Interest Dynamics\n\nWith 5.6% of shares shorted, there’s potential for a short squeeze. While 5.6% is not an overwhelming amount, combined with the low float and high institutional ownership, any positive news or strong buying activity could compound quickly, forcing short sellers to cover their positions and driving the stock price up rapidly.\n\n**Conclusion**: With strong financial performance, strategic partnerships, growth in CTV, the upcoming election year boost, analyst confidence, significant institutional ownership, a low float, and increased attention from investors, Magnite (MGNI) is well-positioned for explosive growth in 2024. It’s a stock worth considering for your portfolio.\n\n**Disclaimer**: I am not a financial advisor. This post is not financial advice. You should always do your own research and consider your own financial situation and goals before making any investment decisions.

Goal-setting itself isn't the problem -- the way it is forced and meaningless is. You want employees that *want* on their own to make the company better ... right? At least one of the subsidiaries you acquired had a better way of achieving this than you do. And this isn't nostalgia or hurt due to change.

C-level management was either incompetent or so out of touch they end up being incompetent, I couldn't tell. Middle management is a bunch of yes-men (men, no women) who aggressively play the \"just go with it even though it's a bad plan, it will get fixed eventually\" card and as far as I can tell they are all highly loaded with stock and just playing a waiting game to dump it all as soon as it vests.. I can't blame them there. Day to day is a slew of overstaffed meetings that should have been (or already were) tracked issues and don't really accomplish anything with some spurts of work thrown in. At SpotX I would be able to get about 20-25 hours per 40hr week of active work completed and Magnite I was peaking in the mid to low teens. It seems from my view that every piece of infrastructure is set up by only skimming documentation and then getting it to a place at which it just barely functions then moving on and never ever coming back to get it out of alpha stage. Bugs become features, duct tape becomes structural and all that. Honestly I have never seen a more toxic work environment. The back to office mandate that all but management follows was a cherry. I loved spotx because of the teams and attitude of all trying to push in the same direction and we all tried that at magnite when we got acquired.. and got promptly thrown under every bus they could find. I'm glad I got a package, others were not so lucky. Beware of the politics in middle management, some of them can lie very well, and pay attention to who is the one pulling their strings. Check the companies cycle of funding, quarterly reports and then immediate stock dumps by all employees.",

This leads mid/junior employees to have higher turnover rates than expected.\n\nA lot of teams are very top-heavy, which leaves no room or possibility for others to get promoted. I was at Magnite for over 5 years, and we never once did a proper year end, employee evaluation. At other companies, you typically do your evaluation with your manager in December, who then provides feedback on how to grow in your career. Where you stand in terms of performance should not be a surprise, but at Magnite it is. When January comes around, random people get promoted, and your manager will just look at you shrug and say there wasn't enough budget for anyone else to get promoted. Given promotions only happen once a year, this is an extremely upsetting situation to be in, and is the exact reason why many people leave the company. \n\nEach team's RTO is different. Understandably, RTO is the new normal, but then everyone should be held to the same standard. There are engineers that need to be in the office 3x a week, but then several SALES people are allowed to work completely remote? People who lead large teams are completely remote? The company needs a more fair stance. It seems only senior level people at the company got permission to be remote, while everyone else is held to a different standard.",

C-level management was either incompetent or so out of touch they end up being incompetent, I couldn't tell. Middle management is a bunch of yes-men (men, no women) who aggressively play the \"just go with it even though it's a bad plan, it will get fixed eventually\" card and as far as I can tell they are all highly loaded with stock and just playing a waiting game to dump it all as soon as it vests.. I can't blame them there. Day to day is a slew of overstaffed meetings that should have been (or already were) tracked issues and don't really accomplish anything with some spurts of work thrown in. At SpotX I would be able to get about 20-25 hours per 40hr week of active work completed and Magnite I was peaking in the mid to low teens. It seems from my view that every piece of infrastructure is set up by only skimming documentation and then getting it to a place at which it just barely functions then moving on and never ever coming back to get it out of alpha stage. Bugs become features, duct tape becomes structural and all that. Honestly I have never seen a more toxic work environment. The back to office mandate that all but management follows was a cherry. I loved spotx because of the teams and attitude of all trying to push in the same direction and we all tried that at magnite when we got acquired.. and got promptly thrown under every bus they could find. I'm glad I got a package, others were not so lucky. Beware of the politics in middle management, some of them can lie very well, and pay attention to who is the one pulling their strings. Check the companies cycle of funding, quarterly reports and then immediate stock dumps by all employees.",

I was at Magnite for over 5 years, and we never once did a proper year end, employee evaluation. At other companies, you typically do your evaluation with your manager in December, who then provides feedback on how to grow in your career. Where you stand in terms of performance should not be a surprise, but at Magnite it is. When January comes around, random people get promoted, and your manager will just look at you shrug and say there wasn't enough budget for anyone else to get promoted. Given promotions only happen once a year, this is an extremely upsetting situation to be in, and is the exact reason why many people leave the company. \n\nEach team's RTO is different. Understandably, RTO is the new normal, but then everyone should be held to the same standard. There are engineers that need to be in the office 3x a week, but then several SALES people are allowed to work completely remote? People who lead large teams are completely remote? The company needs a more fair stance. It seems only senior level people at the company got permission to be remote, while everyone else is held to a different standard.",

      "# [Inside the Magnite C-Suite with Chief Product Officer Adam Soroca by Mariah Cooper on 2024-08-26](https://www.magnite.com/blog/inside-the-magnite-c-suite-with-chief-product-officer-adam-soroca/)\nIn this Q+A, we sit down with Chief Product Officer Adam Soroca to get a behind-the-scenes look at product development at Magnite, his insights on the future of ad tech, and what keeps him motivated and excited about the industry.\n\nMagnite’s C-Suite series provides a unique opportunity to gain firsthand perspectives on critical industry trends and strategic initiatives shaping Magnite’s core values and future.\n\nWhat are you most passionate about in your role as chief product officer at Magnite? What drives your product vision and innovation strategy?\n\nSo, this answer has two dimensions: the work we do and the team we get to work alongside. One is Magnite’s role and the scale at which we operate. Magnite has incredible scale across all the leading media formats. Our ability to connect buyers with sellers’ inventory and influence consumers is immense. It’s a real privilege and an honor to build and innovate on this stage.\n\nI enjoy the mix of creativity and problem-solving. I like to sit at the dreaming level and think about things that don’t exist and the detailed technology needed to make them work. We often flip-flop between those two categories before merging them together.\n\nOur approach is a constant mix of “What does the market say? What do our clients say that they think they need? What do they not say that you have to interpret?” From there, our vision unfolds. Sometimes, these are linear, incremental innovations. And sometimes, these things are brand new and bring something to the market that hasn’t been asked for. Some of the most interesting things come from that because you show up with something, and clients say, “I didn’t even know I needed that.” You have to convince the market and help the market evolve in a certain way.\n\nThe other part of my role that motivates me is building the team and developing not just a product team but a cross-functional team to innovate, think differently, and bring these products to market.\n\nMagnite operates in a rapidly evolving landscape. How do you approach product development to ensure Magnite stays ahead of the curve?\n\nThat is the delicate art and dance that we have to do. It’s a constant balance of doing what is requested by clients specifically and pushing forward things on our own that we believe the industry needs. There’s really no perfect science to it. You have to be able to say “no” to a lot. In product management, we say “no” or more like “no, not this quarter” way more often than we say “yes.”\n\nWith so many stakeholders in ad tech (advertisers, publishers), how do you balance their needs when prioritizing product features?\n\nWe balance the portfolio and allocate our resources towards our different product lines, dedicating percentages of our product and engineering resources to work on each. That rebalancing happens at the executive leadership team level. However, once that allocation is set within the product lines, those product managers and engineering leaders are free to prioritize however they see appropriate. As a company, we first build heavier on the ad server and publisher side. We balance that out with products that benefit our marketers, whether it’s for the brands, the agencies, or the DSPs so that they can buy our inventory fairly, transparently, and advantageously.\n\nWhat exciting product innovations are currently in the pipeline at Magnite? Can you give us a sneak peek?\n\nWe’re excited about a lot of things coming to market. We are working on a single sign-on and universal navigation between Magnite Streaming and SpringServe for a seamless user experience. We want our publisher clients who use both products to feel like it’s one product. We also are building out our identity suite and scaling it to suit the needs of our clients. Curated Marketplaces is on track to add targeting and features to DV+ and add capabilities to our self-service workflow for streaming inventory.\n\nWe have advanced forecasting that’s hitting the market. We’re also looking into new investments, specifically in live television, and expanding upon our initial success with Tiles into other formats. This is innovation and the redefinition of the advertising experience for connected television.\n\nNow for something fun! Tell us about the first concert you ever attended.\n\nRolling Stones at Shea Stadium. Living Colour opened up for that. It was a great concert with a bunch of my friends from high school, and we had a blast!",
      "# [Inside the Magnite C-Suite with Chief People Officer Shawna Hughes by Mariah Cooper on 2025-01-24](https://www.magnite.com/blog/inside-the-magnite-c-suite-with-chief-people-officer-shawna-hughes/)\nIn this Q+A, we sit down with Chief People Officer Shawna Hughes to discuss her passion for fostering a supportive and flexible workplace culture at Magnite, her approach to driving employee development, and the innovative talent strategies she’s implementing to meet the evolving needs of the ad tech industry.\n\nMagnite’s C-Suite series provides a unique opportunity to gain firsthand perspectives on critical industry trends and strategic initiatives shaping Magnite’s core values and future.\n\nAs the Chief People Officer at Magnite, how do you approach fostering a strong workplace culture?\n\nI am focused on the small things that reinforce support and care for our employees. Our approach at Mangite is if you live it, you don’t have to say it.\n\nFinding multiple avenues to show that support in different ways excites me about my job.\n\nWhen it comes to driving the culture, the People team is a conduit. The People team creates and coordinates tools and processes to enable leaders and employees to take ownership of the culture. When everyone feels like they are part of the culture rather than being told what it is, that drives a great workplace.\n\nThe People team looks to foster culture by allowing individual choice. Employees can regularly elect what is important to them. Examples of this include extensive benefits offerings, peer-to-peer recognition and customized awards, tenure recognition, and company donation matching for charitable donations. Employees are offered a number of options and can truly navigate the company in a way that’s customized to them.\n\nIn a fast-evolving industry like ad tech, how do you ensure that Magnite’s talent strategies remain innovative and forward-thinking?\n\nIt goes back to the small things that matter because if you’ve built the foundation of flexibility and multiple avenues of support, you can double down at any moment on one of those. Driving flexibility and creativity in how we support our employees is the foundation of being able to adjust whatever is thrown our way, especially in an environment that’s very focused on costs. It’s not just about programs. It’s also about tools.\n\nFor instance, we recognize the need to broaden our conversations and enhance the tools available so managers and employees can better discuss performance and career development. In response, we rolled out the 9-box evaluation method. This tool evaluates employees on performance and potential growth. We are also transparent about job leveling within the organization. It’s like a compass for employee development—once you know where everyone stands, you can confidently map out the best route forward.\n\nWe offer employees development opportunities and transparency regarding the skills and abilities required for each role and in all functions. We also have an open forum for employees to ask our CEO and other senior leaders questions about the company or industry as a whole.\n\nWith so many teams and personalities at Magnite, how do you balance the varied needs of employees across departments while setting company-wide people initiatives?\n\nWe prioritize getting a lot of feedback. We have an engagement survey for company employees and gather feedback from different steps in the recruiting process. We will not succeed without that feedback. Being proactive about getting feedback is the foundation of what we do. We can’t always say yes at the moment to any given request, just like a product roadmap, but it always goes on the list to build and enhance.\n\nCan you share any programs or initiatives at Magnite that support employee growth and well-being?\n\nThis year, we’re trying to launch more employee-led resource groups. We will keep evolving our performance management process to support ongoing career development. We also offer a lunch program funded by the company that allows people to order lunches instead of catering. This allows individual needs to be met by ordering the food they want to eat and the flexibility to choose when to eat it, unlike a catered lunch, where people cannot choose the food they want to eat and may miss out on getting food due to meetings or other work commitments. I’m very proud of our lunch program.\n\nIf you could instantly master any skill, what would it be?\n\nPersonally, it would be singing—I cannot sing at all! Professionally, it’d be transforming from reactivity to proactivity.",

These forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of the report in which they are included.

Without limiting the foregoing, any guidance we may provide will generally be given only in connection with quarterly and annual earnings announcements, without interim updates, and we may appear at industry conferences or make other public statements without disclosing material nonpublic information in our possession. Given these uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Investors should read this press release and the documents that we reference in this press release and have filed or will file with the SEC completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Operational Measures:\n\nIn addition to our GAAP results, we review certain non-GAAP financial measures to help us evaluate our business on a consistent basis, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of investments in our technology and development and sales and marketing, and assess our operational efficiencies. These non-GAAP financial measures include Contribution ex-TAC, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Income (Loss), and Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) per share, each of which is discussed below.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, or as superior to, the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments, and review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP measures, and the reasons we consider them appropriate. It is important to note that the particular items we exclude from, or include in, our non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the items excluded from, or included in, similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. See \"Reconciliation of Revenue to Gross Profit to Contribution ex-TAC,\" \"Reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA,\" \"Reconciliation of net income (loss) to non-GAAP income (loss),\" and \"Reconciliation of GAAP earnings (loss) per share to non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share\" included as part of this press release.\n\nWe do not provide a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial expectations for Contribution ex-TAC and Adjusted EBITDA, or a forecast of the most comparable GAAP measures, because the amount and timing of many future charges that impact these measures (such as amortization of future acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related charges, foreign exchange (gain) loss, net, stock-based compensation, impairment charges, provision or benefit for income taxes, and our future revenue mix), which could be material, are variable, uncertain, or out of our control and therefore cannot be reasonably predicted without unreasonable effort, if at all. In addition, we believe such reconciliations or forecasts could imply a degree of precision that might be confusing or misleading to investors.\n\nContribution ex-TAC:\n\nContribution ex-TAC is calculated as gross profit plus cost of revenue, excluding traffic acquisition cost (\"TAC\"). Traffic acquisition cost, a component of cost of revenue, represents what we must pay sellers for the sale of advertising inventory through our platform for revenue reported on a gross basis. Contribution ex-TAC is a non-GAAP financial measure that is most comparable to gross profit. We believe Contribution ex-TAC is a useful measure in facilitating a consistent comparison against our core business without considering the impact of traffic acquisition costs related to revenue reported on a gross basis.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA:\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment charges, interest income or expense, and other cash and non-cash based income or expenses that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance, including, but not limited to foreign exchange gains and losses, acquisition and related items, gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, other debt refinancing expenses, non-operational real estate and other expenses (income), net, and provision (benefit) for income taxes. We also track future expenses on an Adjusted EBITDA basis, and describe them as Adjusted EBITDA operating expenses, which includes total operating expenses. Total operating expenses include cost of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA operating expenses is calculated as Contribution ex-TAC less Adjusted EBITDA. We adjust Adjusted EBITDA operating expenses for the same expense items excluded in Adjusted EBITDA. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our performance for the following reasons:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company’s performance without regard to items such as those we exclude in calculating this measure, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired.\n\nOur management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies, and in communications with our board of directors concerning our performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also used as a metric for determining payment of cash incentive compensation.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA provides a measure of consistency and comparability with our past performance that many investors find useful, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, and also facilitates comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\n\nAlthough Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. These limitations include:\n\nStock-based compensation is a non-cash charge and will remain an element of our long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period.\n\nDepreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, and the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, but Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements.\n\nImpairment charges are non-cash charges related to goodwill, intangible assets and/or long-lived assets.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisition and related items, such as amortization of acquired intangible assets, merger, acquisition, or restructuring related severance costs, and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash and non-cash charges and changes in, or cash requirements for, acquisition and related items, such as certain transaction expenses.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash and non-cash charges related to certain financing transactions such as gains or losses on extinguishment of debt or other debt refinancing expenses.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain non-operational real estate and other (income) and expense, net, which consists of transactions or expenses that are typically by nature non-operating, one-time items, or unrelated to our core operations.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in our working capital needs, capital expenditures, or contractual commitments.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for income taxes and the cash impact of other income or expense.\n\nOther companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\nOur Adjusted EBITDA is influenced by fluctuations in our revenue, cost of revenue, and the timing and amounts of the cost of our operations. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nNon-GAAP Income (Loss) and Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) per Share:\n\nWe define non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share as non-GAAP income (loss) divided by non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding. Non-GAAP income (loss) is equal to net income (loss) excluding stock-based compensation, cash and non-cash based merger, acquisition, and restructuring costs, which consist primarily of professional service fees associated with merger and acquisition activities, cash-based employee termination costs, and other restructuring activities, including facility closures, relocation costs, contract termination costs, and impairment costs of abandoned technology associated with restructuring activities, amortization of acquired intangible assets, gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, non-operational real estate and other expenses or income, foreign currency gains and losses, interest expense associated with Convertible Senior Notes, other debt refinance expenses, and the tax impact of these items. In periods in which we have non-GAAP income, non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding used to calculate non-GAAP earnings per share includes the impact of potentially dilutive shares. Potentially dilutive shares consist of stock options, restricted stock units, performance stock units, and potential shares issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, each computed using the treasury stock method, and the impact of shares that would be issuable assuming conversion of all of the Convertible Senior Notes, calculated under the if-converted method. We believe non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance and our trends on a per share basis, and also facilitates comparison of our financial results on a per share basis with other companies, many of which present a similar non-GAAP measure. However, a potential limitation of our use of non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share is that other companies may define non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share differently, which may make comparison difficult. This measure may also exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. Non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share is a performance measure and should not be used as a measure of liquidity. Because of these limitations, we also consider the comparable GAAP measure of net income (loss).\n\nMAGNITE, INC.\n\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n\n(In thousands)\n\n(unaudited)December 31,
