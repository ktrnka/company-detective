      "# [Open Bidding FAQ on 2023-09-01](https://www.magnite.com/openbiddingfaq/)\n1. I reviewed the Terms & Conditions and found some language that I was not comfortable agreeing to. Can I propose changes/redlines?\n\nUnfortunately, given the high volume of Google Open Bidding publishers who are participating in this program, Magnite is unable to accommodate any custom changes/redlines to the Terms & Conditions at this time.\n\n2. How long does it normally take Magnite to review my submission?\n\nMagnite is doing its best to expedite the review of each submission and expects the review process to normally take up to three business days. Magnite thanks you for your patience as this new Open Bidding program is rolled out.\n\nIf approved, Magnite will require that you update your Ads.txt/App-Ads.txt file in order to monetize your inventory. It is recommended that you get a head start by inserting the following line item:\n\nrubiconproject.com, 22884, DIRECT, 0bfd66d529a55807\n\nMagnite also recommends that you bookmark the Google OB Terms you consented to by bookmarking the following URL. This will allow you to access these legal terms for future reference.\n\n4. It’s been a week. Will I receive email notification from Magnite once I am approved or rejected?\n\nDue to the high volume of submissions, Magnite will not be able to send you a separate email notification once your inventory starts monetizing. However, your application’s status will appear in your applicable Bidder’s UI interface (Google Ad Manager or Google Admob) as one of three statuses:\n\n“Pending” – your submission is still under review\n\n“Approved” – your submission was approved and monetization should begin soon\n\n“Rejected” – your submission was rejected\n\n5. When I checked my status in my Google Bidder’s UI interface (AdManager or Admob), it shows my status as “rejected.” How can I find out the reasons for the rejection? Is there a way I can appeal the decision?\n\nDue to the high volume of submissions received and Magnite’s focus on reviewing all submissions as quickly as possible, Magnite is unable to provide detailed rejection reasons or offer a path to appeal at this time. To increase your chances of approval, please make sure to provide detailed & accurate information when initially submitting your information.\n\n6. I did not enter any billing information when I submitted my form. How will Magnite provide me performance reporting and know how to pay me?\n\nOne of the value propositions of the Google Open Bidding program is to offer publishers consolidated billing/reporting. Google will be providing you performance reporting and remitting payments directly to you. You will not receive a login to the Magnite platform.\n\n7. What ad formats or sizes does Magnite support?\n\nMagnite supports monetization across a wide variety of ad formats and industry-standard sizes, including desktop web, mobile web, mobile app, and video. Ad formats include, but are not limited to, banners, interstitials, in-stream or outstream, and rewarded video.\n\n8. Which countries is Magnite able to do business with under this program?\n\nIf your inventory becomes approved, and as long as your company is not registered to do business in, nor has its principal place of business located in, any of the countries listed HERE, then you are eligible to work with Magnite.\n\n9. What if I have new domains or app bundles that I wish to monetize with Magnite, but were not included in my original submission? How do I get those approved?\n\nIf you have new inventory that Magnite hasn’t reviewed, please provide your Google Publisher ID and any new domain and/or app bundle details to Magnite’s email alias of OBSupport@magnite.com. If/when it is approved, you can begin sending that inventory to Magnite for monetization.\n\n10. I have ad inventory available for monetization from many different countries. Which countries will Magnite be able to monetize?\n\nThere are some exceptions, but you can expect Magnite to be able to monetize a wide array of ad formats in most major countries around the world.\n\n11. I don’t have my Google Publisher ID readily available. Is that going to be a problem to get approved?\n\nIt is important that you provide your Google Publisher ID when submitting your application to Magnite. If you are having trouble locating your Google Publisher ID, you can click here if you are an Admob publisher and click here if you are a Google Ad Manager publisher for more information. Please also note that if you require additional email support for any reason after your submission, please make sure to include your Google Publisher ID in your email inquiry to expedite a reply from Magnite.\n\n12. I still have additional unanswered questions. Should I email my Google or my Magnite representative?",

I have stock in Magnite and I have been watching this companies stock drop day after day. It makes me wonder if there is something going on behind the scenes or if there is some underlying issue causing this to drop day after day after day. It could just be because it’s not as speculative an investment as say Pubmatic or TTD. \n\nI know this Reddit sub is for programmatic discussion so feel free to share insights or anything you might find related to this.

The largest SSPs for audio are AdsWizz (owned by SXM), Triton (owned by iHeart), and Dax Audio. When you work with SXM or iHeart, you'll notice the deals will be mapped through the SSP that the publisher owns. \n\n  \nSpotify works with Google and Magnite as their SSPs.\n\n### Comment ID lj96wmt with +1 score by [(Unfair_Donkey_6732, Reddit, 2024-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1exvrds/ssps_who_has_the_best_audio_inventory/lj96wmt/) (in reply to ID lj8zrer):\nThanks, this is helpful!

The demand for digital advertisements has increased due to the growing popularity of streaming services, and I expect this industry to do very well in the next few years. I’d like to know opinions on which of these three companies are best positioned to take advantage of the expanding advertising space. \n\nOverview:\n\n**MGNI - Magnite**\n\nMarket Cap: $3.40 billion \n\nLast Quarter revenue: $60.98 million\n\nEPS: 0.06\n\nMagnite, Inc. operates an independent sell-side advertising platform in the United States and internationally. Its omnichannel advertising platform enables publishers to monetize various auction types and formats, including CTV, desktop display, video, audio, and mobile, as well as allows agencies and brands to access brand-safe ad inventory and execute advertising transactions. The company is based in Los Angeles, California. \n\n**PERI - Perion Network Ltd.**\n\nMarket Cap: $321.21 million\n\nLast quarter revenue: $83.41 million\n\nEPS: 0.08\n\nPerion Network Ltd., a technology company, delivers advertising solutions to brands, agencies, and publishers in North America, Europe, and internationally. The company develops digital advertising solutions to capture consumer attention and drive engagement, as well as delivers ads across a portfolio of Websites and mobile applications. Its proprietary social marketing platform offers a dashboard for marketers that make media buying efficient on Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, and other social networks and platforms. The company's platform allows advertisers to control their marketing expenditures, in-house planning and strategy, and utilize the technical tool to create operational marketing efficiencies. In addition, it provides search-based monetization solutions for publishers with analytics capabilities to track and monitor their business performance; Smilebox that enables people to tell the stories of their lives with customizable eCards, slideshows, invitations, and collages; and IncrediMail a messaging application that enables consumers to manage various email accounts in one place. The company was formerly known as IncrediMail Ltd. and changed its name to Perion Network Ltd. in November 2011. Perion Network Ltd. was incorporated in 1999 and is headquartered in Holon, Israel.\n\n**PUBM - PubMatic, Inc.**\n\nMarket Cap: $1.28 billion\n\nLast quarter earnings: $34.39 million \n\nEPS: 0.25\n\nPubMatic, Inc. provides a cloud infrastructure platform that enables real-time programmatic advertising transactions worldwide. Its platform supports an array of ad formats and digital device types, including mobile app, mobile web, desktop, display, video, over-the-top, connected television, and media. The company was founded in 2006 and is headquartered in Redwood City, California. PubMatic had their IPO in early December 2020. \n\n\nI think all three stocks are good buys, with PERI being the most undervalued at the moment. If anyone has anything to add it would be much appreciated!\n\n## Comment ID gi79byj with +15 score by [(cold-brew-101, Reddit, 2021-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kr2jlk/mgni_peri_or_pubm/gi79byj/) (in reply to ID kr2jlk):\nYou'll want to get into PERI, it is a company that has raised guidance twice this year and is seeing a resurgence in growth.

Because of a thing called 'header bidding', most SSPs all tend to sell more or less the same supply as each other though you have some like Triplelift that specialize in native ads (ads that seem more like organic content).\n\nI *think* there's more value in companies like LiveRamp that's a data platform especially as there is continuously growing interest/concern around data privacy but it doesn't really appear to be reflected in their stock price.\n\n### Comment ID gi7hxwu with +3 score by [(2toness, Reddit, 2021-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kr2jlk/mgni_peri_or_pubm/gi7hxwu/) (in reply to ID gi7ekbr):\nWhat is your sentiment on MGNI then?\n\n#### Comment ID gi8t7uj with +6 score by [(Cheesepuff_BeanDip, Reddit, 2021-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kr2jlk/mgni_peri_or_pubm/gi8t7uj/) (in reply to ID gi7hxwu):\nMGNI provides massive ad placement reach/scale, full transparency into their auction process, and also partners with TTD/LiveRamp on forward-thinking projects like Unified ID.  \n\n\nPubMatic is an SSP that I often disable from campaigns I run.

I think they're the first big supply side partner to get involved so points for that. For reference - Unified ID 2.0 is perceived to be very important for the business with cookies and such going away. I have a positive view of their CEO too who's a seasoned adtech vet.\n\nI don't really know their financials or their growth but their stock 4Xing over the past year seems like .... an overvaluation and just riding the coattails of TTD though. They haven't exactly done anything to warrant all that hype but I suppose it's been a huge bull market. There was some excitement a while back about their sole partnership with Hulu but I think that's no longer exclusive to Magnite\n\nIf you're deciding between these though, just dump your money into Magnite or TTD lol.\n\n## Comment ID gi7tmv6 with +6 score by [(play_it_safe, Reddit, 2021-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kr2jlk/mgni_peri_or_pubm/gi7tmv6/) (in reply to ID kr2jlk):\nThere are others, too. \n\nMAX, IBEX, FLNT, BCOV\n\nAlso, you left out the most important part: how much they're growing and future trajectories.\n\n### Comment ID gi7xydc with +3 score by [(SaveThemTurdles, Reddit, 2021-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kr2jlk/mgni_peri_or_pubm/gi7xydc/) (in reply to ID gi7tmv6):\nThanks, Haven’t looked into those yet. \n\nMGNI has the best YOY growth of the three. \n\nPERI has consistent growth over the last three quarters and I think next earnings will continue the trend.

They are all turnaround plays!!!\nIt's not a growth stock!!!\n\nThis seems like a lot of confidence for a company that most recently grew only 12% year over year.\n\nI know the headline ran with 62% growth and some of the financial sites show that 62% as well. But from their own quarterly press release, that is not the actual growth rate. \n\nMagnite revenue was $61.0 million for Q3 2020, up 62% from Q3 2019 on an as reported basis and up 12% on a pro-forma basis\n\nThird quarter 2020 financial results of Magnite represent the combined performance of Rubicon Project and Telaria, which merged on April 1, 2020. Third quarter 2019 comparative numbers do not include results from Telaria, unless noted as pro-forma.\n\nTelaria was around a $15M/quarter company. So the 62% doesn’t take into account nearly 25% of the combined company total revenue into the comparable. And when you look at the comparable it’s only 12% growth for the combined company. \n\nFurther the mobile and desktop grew about 3% YoY. And CTV accounted for $11M and 18% of revenue and grew at 51%. At $11M that should be growing near triple digits to be anywhere near matching the narrative. $11M and 51% are pathetically small numbers for what should be a hypergrowth market. And that CTV growth rate has fallen like a rock every quarter.\n\nThe guidance is similarly weak at $75M at top of guide. The Q4 combined comparable is $68.1M, implying 10-11% growth. Q4 is a seasonally larger quarter for both of the Magnite companies. As typical you can expect Q1 guide to show a decline QoQ. And probably continued 10-12% growth.\n\nAnnual Revenues from the past few years:\n\n2016: 278M\n2017:155M -44% YoY\n2018:124M -20% YoY\n2019: 156M +26% YoY\n\n\nThis is clearly a \"hope for a turnaround\" company and not a high growth company!!!\n\n## Comment ID gkrrz6h with +1 score by [(Aside_Much, Reddit, 2021-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kr2jlk/mgni_peri_or_pubm/gkrrz6h/) (in reply to ID kr2jlk):\nGreat write up!    \nTake a look at Comscore / $SCOR.

This means they help fill advertising space, primarily on websites, apps, and **connected TV (CTV)** platforms. Price per share at time of writing: $40.20\n\n**CTV -** Basically anything that is not cable TV is connected TV. Connecting through your xbox or roku or apple TV or however you want to stream TV. This is the **primary source of revenue** for $MGNI. Are you on the poor people version of Hulu that runs ads? Those ads run through MGNI.\n\nSo let me ask you - is there a movement towards cable TV, or a movement towards finding other ways to watch TV through streaming services? I think you know the answer. And that is reason #1 to buy in. **As CTV increases in popularity, so does demand for advertising space, and so does $MGNI revenue.**\n\n**Industry comparison -**\n\nTrade Desk ($TTD). TTD operates on the buy side of ad tech, so while not exactly the same, they are within the same industry. TTD is currently **up 2800%** over the last 4 years, with a market cap of $38.5 billion. Where is $MGNI? A shade under $5 billion. Now is it realistic to expect MGNI to be the next home run play like TTD (who my brother sold for $50/share, RIP)? Predicting anything to go up 2800% in 4 years is unlikely but who knows. But **if MGNI can get to even half the market cap of TTD, that is a price target of $160.** (Current: $40/share, Mcap 4.75 Billion)\n\n**Past/future earnings:**\n\nPast earnings and future earnings show the story of a company with fairly rapid growth. Take a look for yourself:\n\nQ1 2020 Revenue - $36.3MM, up 12% YoY from Q1 2019\n\nQ2 2020 Revenue - $42.3MM, up 12% YoY from Q2 2019\n\nQ3 2020 Revenue - $61MM, up 62% YoY from Q3 2019\n\n*Q4 2020 Revenue - Expected $72-75MM, up \\~50% YoY from Q4 2019*\n\n**$MGNI is up %335 in the past 12 mo, am I too late to the party?**\n\nAnswer: **NO,** and although I already outlined some reasons why above, here is a list for you:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. CTV will      only increase in popularity, which is where the bulk of MGNI revenue comes      from\n2. $MGNI is      showing accelerated growth, great for a mid-cap company to try to make the      jump to large-cap\n3. Trade Desk      (TTD), who is not a competitor but is in the same industry, is valued      nearly 10x higher than MGNI.\n4. Earnings      coming up 2/24, which I expect MGNI to crush, and I do not think that      earnings are priced in yet.\n5. Needham      analyst Laura Martin makes MGNI her top pick for 2021, saying 500% growth      is possible (Jan 13 [Why Wall Street analysts think Magnite may be the      next hot play in ad tech (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/why-wall-street-analysts-think-magnite-may-be-the-next-hot-play-in-ad-tech.html))\n6. Survived a      short hit piece by Spruce Point Capital on Jan 8 (Thank you for a low      entry point for some calls)\n7. **PR Today: Launch of “Unified Decisioning”,** a new MGNI product/software. From article:\n\n*“Publishers are eager to tap into the efficiencies that programmatic provides without relinquishing the control they are used to when selling directly to buyers. Unified Decisioning enables them to do both and we’re excited to bring these capabilities to leading CTV publishers.”* Link: [*Magnite Introduces Open Beta of New CTV & OTT Solution Named Unified Decisioning | Business Wire*](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210202005138/en/Magnite-Introduces-Open-Beta-of-New-CTV-OTT-Solution-Named-Unified-Decisioning)\n\nIf you’re interested in companies that are trending from bottom-left to top-right, then I encourage you to invest in $MGNI. I believe it is a **good short-term play**; having just went on a weeklong dip from Jan 22 - Jan 29, I think you have a decent entry point here at $41.50, although I believe any entry point is fine at this stage in the company’s growth. Also in the short-term is earnings on 2/24 which I believe will be good for MGNI. It is also a **good long-term play** for reasons above, my EOY price target is $125, although it would not surprise me if it goes significantly higher. The $MGNI train hasn’t even left the station!\n\nPositions: 100 shares @ $16, 2/19 35c x5, 2/19 40c x2, 2/19 45c x10, 2/19 50c x2 (Slight degeneracy)\n\n**TL/DR:** MGNI is a growing company in the growing industry of advertising in (primarily) connected TV services (Think: Roku). Same realm as $TTD but 1/10th the market cap. Much room to grow. Earnings coming up 2/24 and Laura Martin’s stock pick of 2021. Just released beta of new software today. Not financial advice, I just like the stock.\n\nEdit: MGNI acquires SpotX for 1.1 billion.

There was a point a long time ago where SSPs were differentiated by the inventory they had. Due to things like header bidding (publishers can make their inventory available across MANY SSPs instead of just one), that went away. Yeah CTV is a thing but every other SSP is focused on it and it’s not like Magnite offers anything unique there either - they HAD a unique offering for Hulu but no longer the case.\n\nBefore Magnite merged - would I have had a bullish outlook on the 2 companies? No lol. \n\nI’m sure Magnite will keep growing because AdTech as a whole follows TTD in trend as that is the industry darling and powerhouse outside of the massive boys like Google and honestly, I’d buy almost entirely on account of that. If TTD wasn’t public, I’d be amazed if Magnite was anywhere close to its share price now. \n\nSummary : keep watching TTD. If TTD ever drops, Magnite will also have a terrible day\n\n### Comment ID glth4i1 with +1 score by [(Environmental-Kiwi78, Reddit, 2021-02-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbb8zv/mgni_why_it_is_still_a_great_time_to_buy/glth4i1/) (in reply to ID glte7cr):\nThank you.

They are expected to expand into Canada soon and have positive earnings in their March report. Even though they're in the same sector, they actually make more revenue than MGNI (228m to MGNI's 139m last year) and they're about 1/10th of the entry point price.

If you’re applying for in house roles with just 2 years experience, you’re going to be going against people with more experience. Not saying it can’t be done, but just curb your expectations.\n\nMy experience applying for and interviewing for in house roles is that they are less established in their processes and product implementation than an agency role. Being able to evaluate partners and provide POVs is a very valuable skill to set yourself apart. Also, most in house roles I’ve applied for want someone with programmatic, social, and search experience. So your social experience is a good addition.\n\nGood benefits and pay usually come with climbing the career ladder, which is why most people want to climb it. If I could make the same pay as an associate as I could as a VP, I’d obviously choose to be an associate.\n\n## Comment ID iip8b66 with +5 score by [(Crazy_Cat_Dude2, Reddit, 2022-08-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/wecmof/programmatic_career_path/iip8b66/) (in reply to ID wecmof):\nPublisher side is pretty chill.

Some agencies are better at retaining folks in account transitions, but others arent so that depends on where you work at. \n\nAlso the other downside of being at a client is the company is constantly putting more and more workload on you for the same pay, as they try to manage profitability for wall Street.\n\n## Comment ID iiohgtw with +1 score by [(maddog2047, Reddit, 2022-08-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/wecmof/programmatic_career_path/iiohgtw/) (in reply to ID wecmof):\nClient side is most definitely not ‘chill’ - different set of pressures, but if you have the appetite you can get invaluable exposure to non media colleagues who can accelerate your development\n\n## Comment ID iir32y7 with +1 score by [(DeCyantist, Reddit, 2022-08-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/wecmof/programmatic_career_path/iir32y7/) (in reply to ID wecmof):\nWorking client side is real business pressure rather than client pressure.

Kia is sitting there with Sonet which has the interior quality from two segments above, but Kiger is there with rattly plastic. Your average 10L spending customer is no longer interested in products that feels cheaper and hence why you see Nissan do the sensible thing and improve the interior of the Magnite even if they haven't made any substantial change.\n\nAs an example, when I was buying a small hatch, I actually looked at amaze, it's a very superior car for my purpose. But, I couldn't sell it to my family because of the lacklustre Honda sales reception, the bare-bones interiors, colour choices and to a large extent a dull test ride. What I am noticing obviously is as people's quality of life and financial potential improves, they are looking for good presentation, especially when they are shelling out on big products.\n\nAll the things said above magnifies dramatically once they look at a product line from Hyundai, Kia and even Tata and Mahindra in this price range. You can Kiger is a solid 1L or 2L cheaper, but when people look at Venue they will check out the i20 and even the bottom segment i10 grand nios. It all feels very premium and well put together, and not like they are being sold something cheap with compromises. When you go to the Tata or Mahindra, your family will check out the XUV 700 and Harriers. They would rather buy something that's a segment below from a brand that offers Harrier than a showroom that's sitting there with one car that doesn't feel as premium.\n\nSo, they have to bring the products quality to at least the old Duster level to survive in the market, then the service and sales experience factors in.\n\n### Comment ID lshx9rn with +4 score by [(sid3091, Reddit, 2024-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lshx9rn/) (in reply to ID lsbnsqh):\n> Your average 10L spending customer is no longer interested in products that feels\n\nYou're not getting a sonet at 10 lacs, my guy.

It also comes kitted with front parking sensor and auto headlamps; hence why you see a lot of people buying the HTK and HTK+. And the important part is they don't feel like a downgraded version in terms of trim quality, and you can be confident they won't start rattling after a few years.\n\nBut what I meant by 10L spending customer is just people who are ready to spend past 10L and go up to 15L.\n\n## Comment ID lsbt0xv with +9 score by [(WhyAmIHere0025, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lsbt0xv/) (in reply to ID 1g5jgwc):\nTbf, a lot of good cars don’t do well in India, our market has requirements that most people abroad do not care about much, ‘kitna deti hai?’, sunroofs etc.\nEfficiency obviously makes sense since most people here aren’t exactly that rich, and for a lot of people owning a car is an aspiration or a dream, so obviously they want all the gimmicks like a sunroof and electronics, which is why Hyundais and KIAs sell so well (they are decent cars as well no denying that), so simply getting all the basics right doesn’t sell enough, a brand needs some kind of USP for word of mouth, Honda offers brand value die to the historical image of the city, the Germans offer driving dynamics, suzuki offers mileage and reliability etc, and the former two still aren’t doing well here, now imagine how would you explain to a neighbour with no knowledge of cars about why they should get a Renault in today’s time?\n\n## Comment ID lsbsbok with +17 score by [(amanbindra94, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lsbsbok/) (in reply to ID 1g5jgwc):\nI own a CVT turbo Kiger and can vouch that it's the most VFM product in the market at that price band.

The non turbo engine sucks and the turbo one is just satisfactory, especially in the AMTs and many city drivers are going towards automatics even at low price points.\n\n2. India has also seen a shift where many people have started at least thinking of Safety in their top 5 requirements. \n\n3. Also Renault has always been seen as a budget brand because their only car that did respectable numbers after the duster is the Kwid. Renault’s fault for not bringing updated Duster in time to take advantage of the booming SUV market despite the fact that Duster could be considered one of the cars that popularised SUVs in city households. \n\n4. The consumer in that price bracket is more concerned with Fuel Efficiency (Maruti’s strength) than with Ride Comfort (Renault’s only redeeming feature) and since neither offers the better safety they go with Maruti/Hyundai.\n\n### Comment ID lsbt5p5 with +7 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lsbt5p5/) (in reply to ID lsbpzvz):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID lshxork with +2 score by [(sid3091, Reddit, 2024-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lshxork/) (in reply to ID lsbt5p5):\n> 3 more bhp at 17 lakhs on road\n\nAnd 20NM less torque :P\n\n## Comment ID lscjmvz with +3 score by [(HistoricalSeason432, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lscjmvz/) (in reply to ID 1g5jgwc):\nKiger and Magnite( turbo variants) are Punch/Altroz/Exter/Baleno rivals.

It’s just that the post was asking for criticism.\n\n### Comment ID lsbp35y with +6 score by [(sharmaamahesh, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lsbp35y/) (in reply to ID lsbl2a2):\nTurbo engine doesn’t feel underpowered even on highway. I drive kiger cvt and once drove from Gurugram to Surat under 18 hours. The car respond awesome specially in sports mode and I wasn’t even tired after driving ~1200km. The car feels comfortable event at 124-130km/hr. Mileage is something could have been better and noise as well.\n\n#### Comment ID lsbuvus with +2 score by [(No-Combination-2211, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lsbuvus/) (in reply to ID lsbp35y):\nIt’s always small things bro. People shortlist based on specs.\n\nAnd there it takes a beating. And the post was asking for critique.\n\nIt’s a feature loaded VFM product. But lags in sales due to small demerits and has not been marketed well.\n\n## Comment ID lsc53bh with +2 score by [(Thick_Growth_7630, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lsc53bh/) (in reply to ID 1g5jgwc):\n* Noisy engine (Especially when the AC is on)\n* No option for CNG or EV or Hybrid. (Indians need mileage and less maintenance costs)\n* No sunroof, even sub-10L cars offer sunroof. Sonet/Nexon has a sunroof right from the base model. (I don't like the sunroof as it gets hot in the cabin, we are in a country that faces 9-10 months of extreme heat, but the sunroof has become a decisive factor for people buying a car.)\n* Poor mileage - CVT or MT, it returns 12 odd km in the city, which is very low compared to other cars.\n* Despite dashing looks in Black, the car feels like a beefed-up Kwid.\n\n## Comment ID lsc6jlm with +2 score by [(Siddk007, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lsc6jlm/) (in reply to ID 1g5jgwc):\n1.

Had to be towed back and fixed over 2 days.\n\nThen it broke down the same week again at a hill station. Had to be towed again.\n\nAnd then it had acceleration issues for a few years until they figured out what was wrong.\n\nScrew Renault.\n\n## Comment ID lse5f63 with +3 score by [(Silent-Jaguar-13, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lse5f63/) (in reply to ID 1g5jgwc):\nAs a kiger owner, I can’t agree with you more. It’s been a GREAT first car for me. The suspension is quite nice and I can get through bumpy chennai roads without much trouble. \nThe only two cons i have is that the engine sound is quite loud (but you’ll learn to live it) and the mileage is not pretty (im getting 10-11kmpl with only city usage) \nThe pros on the other hand are numerous. Firstly, the looks are stunning (especially my red and black one). Secondly, it’s very spacious; passengers have no complaints of headroom or legroom or even boot space. Thirdly, it’s very feature rich. Doesnt have a sunroof, sure, but it has keyless entry, wireless charger, wireless android auto and apple carplay, folding orvms, and ample amount of storage. Service has been good as well with renault service easily accessible. \n\nHonestly i love this car and I wouldnt trade it for a Sonet or Brezza or any of the “sunroof” cars\n\n## Comment ID lsbor9m with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lsbor9m/) (in reply to ID 1g5jgwc):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID lsbsyor with +3 score by [(Cute_Labrador_, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lsbsyor/) (in reply to ID lsbor9m):\nYo wtf are you even saying?

This leads mid/junior employees to have higher turnover rates than expected.\n\nA lot of teams are very top-heavy, which leaves no room or possibility for others to get promoted. I was at Magnite for over 5 years, and we never once did a proper year end, employee evaluation. At other companies, you typically do your evaluation with your manager in December, who then provides feedback on how to grow in your career. Where you stand in terms of performance should not be a surprise, but at Magnite it is. When January comes around, random people get promoted, and your manager will just look at you shrug and say there wasn't enough budget for anyone else to get promoted. Given promotions only happen once a year, this is an extremely upsetting situation to be in, and is the exact reason why many people leave the company. \n\nEach team's RTO is different. Understandably, RTO is the new normal, but then everyone should be held to the same standard. There are engineers that need to be in the office 3x a week, but then several SALES people are allowed to work completely remote? People who lead large teams are completely remote? The company needs a more fair stance. It seems only senior level people at the company got permission to be remote, while everyone else is held to a different standard.",

C-level management was either incompetent or so out of touch they end up being incompetent, I couldn't tell. Middle management is a bunch of yes-men (men, no women) who aggressively play the \"just go with it even though it's a bad plan, it will get fixed eventually\" card and as far as I can tell they are all highly loaded with stock and just playing a waiting game to dump it all as soon as it vests.. I can't blame them there. Day to day is a slew of overstaffed meetings that should have been (or already were) tracked issues and don't really accomplish anything with some spurts of work thrown in. At SpotX I would be able to get about 20-25 hours per 40hr week of active work completed and Magnite I was peaking in the mid to low teens. It seems from my view that every piece of infrastructure is set up by only skimming documentation and then getting it to a place at which it just barely functions then moving on and never ever coming back to get it out of alpha stage. Bugs become features, duct tape becomes structural and all that. Honestly I have never seen a more toxic work environment. The back to office mandate that all but management follows was a cherry. I loved spotx because of the teams and attitude of all trying to push in the same direction and we all tried that at magnite when we got acquired.. and got promptly thrown under every bus they could find. I'm glad I got a package, others were not so lucky. Beware of the politics in middle management, some of them can lie very well, and pay attention to who is the one pulling their strings. Check the companies cycle of funding, quarterly reports and then immediate stock dumps by all employees.",

C-level management was either incompetent or so out of touch they end up being incompetent, I couldn't tell. Middle management is a bunch of yes-men (men, no women) who aggressively play the \"just go with it even though it's a bad plan, it will get fixed eventually\" card and as far as I can tell they are all highly loaded with stock and just playing a waiting game to dump it all as soon as it vests.. I can't blame them there. Day to day is a slew of overstaffed meetings that should have been (or already were) tracked issues and don't really accomplish anything with some spurts of work thrown in. At SpotX I would be able to get about 20-25 hours per 40hr week of active work completed and Magnite I was peaking in the mid to low teens. It seems from my view that every piece of infrastructure is set up by only skimming documentation and then getting it to a place at which it just barely functions then moving on and never ever coming back to get it out of alpha stage. Bugs become features, duct tape becomes structural and all that. Honestly I have never seen a more toxic work environment. The back to office mandate that all but management follows was a cherry. I loved spotx because of the teams and attitude of all trying to push in the same direction and we all tried that at magnite when we got acquired.. and got promptly thrown under every bus they could find. I'm glad I got a package, others were not so lucky. Beware of the politics in middle management, some of them can lie very well, and pay attention to who is the one pulling their strings.

I was at Magnite for over 5 years, and we never once did a proper year end, employee evaluation. At other companies, you typically do your evaluation with your manager in December, who then provides feedback on how to grow in your career. Where you stand in terms of performance should not be a surprise, but at Magnite it is. When January comes around, random people get promoted, and your manager will just look at you shrug and say there wasn't enough budget for anyone else to get promoted. Given promotions only happen once a year, this is an extremely upsetting situation to be in, and is the exact reason why many people leave the company. \n\nEach team's RTO is different. Understandably, RTO is the new normal, but then everyone should be held to the same standard. There are engineers that need to be in the office 3x a week, but then several SALES people are allowed to work completely remote? People who lead large teams are completely remote?

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as \"may,\" \"might,\" \"will,\" \"objective,\" \"intend,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"can,\" \"would,\" \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"design,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" \"plan\" or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the Company’s guidance or expectations with respect to future financial performance; acquisitions by the Company, or the anticipated benefits thereof; potential synergies from the Company's acquisitions; macroeconomic conditions or concerns related thereto; the growth of ad-supported programmatic connected television (\"CTV\"); our ability to use and collect data to provide our offerings; scope and duration of client relationships; the fees we may charge in the future; our anticipated financial performance; key strategic objectives; anticipated benefits of new offerings; business mix; sales growth; benefits from supply path optimization; the development of identity solutions; client utilization of our offerings; our competitive differentiation; our market share and leadership position in the industry; market conditions, trends, and opportunities; certain statements regarding future operational performance measures; and other statements that are not historical facts. These statements are not guarantees of future performance; they reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and estimates and subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from expectations or results projected or implied by forward-looking statements.\n\nWe discuss many of these risks and additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by our forward-looking statements under the headings \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" and elsewhere in this press release and in other filings we have made and will make from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of the report in which they are included. Unless required by federal securities laws, we assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated, to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the statements are made. Without limiting the foregoing, any guidance we may provide will generally be given only in connection with quarterly and annual earnings announcements, without interim updates, and we may appear at industry conferences or make other public statements without disclosing material nonpublic information in our possession. Given these uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Investors should read this press release and the documents that we reference in this press release and have filed or will file with the SEC completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Operational Measures:\n\nIn addition to our GAAP results, we review certain non-GAAP financial measures to help us evaluate our business on a consistent basis, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of investments in our technology and development and sales and marketing, and assess our operational efficiencies. These non-GAAP measures include Contribution ex-TAC, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Income (Loss), and Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) per share, each of which is discussed below.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, or as superior to, the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments, and review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP measures, and the reasons we consider them appropriate. It is important to note that the particular items we exclude from, or include in, our non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the items excluded from, or included in, similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. See \"Reconciliation of Revenue to Gross Profit to Contribution ex-TAC,\" \"Reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA,\" \"Reconciliation of net loss to non-GAAP income,\" and \"Reconciliation of GAAP loss per share to non-GAAP earnings per share\" included as part of this press release.\n\nWe do not provide a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial expectations for Contribution ex-TAC and Adjusted EBITDA, or a forecast of the most comparable GAAP measures, because the amount and timing of many future charges that impact these measures (such as amortization of future acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related charges, foreign exchange (gain) loss, net, stock-based compensation, impairment charges, provision or benefit for income taxes, and our future revenue mix), which could be material, are variable, uncertain, or out of our control and therefore cannot be reasonably predicted without unreasonable effort, if at all. In addition, we believe such reconciliations or forecasts could imply a degree of precision that might be confusing or misleading to investors.\n\nContribution ex-TAC:\n\nContribution ex-TAC is calculated as gross profit plus cost of revenue, excluding traffic acquisition cost (\"TAC\"). Traffic acquisition cost, a component of cost of revenue, represents what we must pay sellers for the sale of advertising inventory through our platform for revenue reported on a gross basis. Contribution ex-TAC is a non-GAAP financial measure that is most comparable to gross profit. We believe Contribution ex-TAC is a useful measure in assessing the performance of Magnite and facilitates a consistent comparison against our core business without considering the impact of traffic acquisition costs related to revenue reported on a gross basis.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA:\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment charges, interest income or expense, and other cash and non-cash based income or expenses that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance, including, but not limited to foreign exchange gains and losses, acquisition and related items, gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, other debt refinancing expenses, non-operational real estate and other expenses (income), net, and provision (benefit) for income taxes. We also track future expenses on an Adjusted EBITDA basis, and describe them as Adjusted EBITDA operating expenses, which includes total operating expenses. Total operating expenses include cost of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA operating expenses is calculated as Contribution ex-TAC less Adjusted EBITDA. We adjust Adjusted EBITDA operating expenses for the same expense items excluded in Adjusted EBITDA. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our performance for the following reasons:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company’s performance without regard to items such as those we exclude in calculating this measure, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired.\n\nOur management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies, and in communications with our board of directors concerning our performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also used as a metric for determining payment of cash incentive compensation.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA provides a measure of consistency and comparability with our past performance that many investors find useful, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, and also facilitates comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\n\nAlthough Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. These limitations include:\n\nStock-based compensation is a non-cash charge and will remain an element of our long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period.\n\nDepreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, and the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, but Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements.\n\nImpairment charges are non-cash charges related to goodwill, intangible assets and/or long-lived assets.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisition and related items, such as amortization of acquired intangible assets, merger, acquisition, or restructuring related severance costs, and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash and non-cash charges and changes in, or cash requirements for, acquisition and related items, such as certain transaction expenses.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash and non-cash charges related to certain financing transactions such as gains or losses on extinguishment of debt or other debt refinancing expenses.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in our working capital needs, capital expenditures, non-operational real estate expenses or income, or contractual commitments.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for income taxes and the cash impact of other income or expense.\n\nOther companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\nOur Adjusted EBITDA is influenced by fluctuations in our revenue, cost of revenue, and the timing and amounts of the cost of our operations. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nNon-GAAP Income (Loss) and Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) per Share:\n\nWe define non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share as non-GAAP income (loss) divided by non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding. Non-GAAP income (loss) is equal to net income (loss) excluding stock-based compensation, cash and non-cash based merger, acquisition, and restructuring costs, which consist primarily of professional service fees associated with merger and acquisition activities, cash-based employee termination costs, and other restructuring activities, including facility closures, relocation costs, contract termination costs, and impairment costs of abandoned technology associated with restructuring activities, amortization of acquired intangible assets, gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, non-operational real estate and other expenses or income, foreign currency gains and losses, interest expense associated with Convertible Senior Notes, other debt refinance expenses, and the tax impact of these items. In periods in which we have non-GAAP income, non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding used to calculate non-GAAP earnings per share includes the impact of potentially dilutive shares. Potentially dilutive shares consist of stock options, restricted stock units, performance stock units, and potential shares issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, each computed using the treasury stock method, and the impact of shares that would be issuable assuming conversion of all of the Convertible Senior Notes, calculated under the if-converted method. We believe non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance and our trends on a per share basis, and also facilitates comparison of our financial results on a per share basis with other companies, many of which present a similar non-GAAP measure. However, a potential limitation of our use of non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share is that other companies may define non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share differently, which may make comparison difficult. This measure may also exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. Non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share is a performance measure and should not be used as a measure of liquidity.

      "# [Inside the Magnite C-Suite with Chief Product Officer Adam Soroca by Mariah Cooper on 2024-08-26](https://www.magnite.com/blog/inside-the-magnite-c-suite-with-chief-product-officer-adam-soroca/)\nIn this Q+A, we sit down with Chief Product Officer Adam Soroca to get a behind-the-scenes look at product development at Magnite, his insights on the future of ad tech, and what keeps him motivated and excited about the industry.\n\nMagnite’s C-Suite series provides a unique opportunity to gain firsthand perspectives on critical industry trends and strategic initiatives shaping Magnite’s core values and future.\n\nWhat are you most passionate about in your role as chief product officer at Magnite? What drives your product vision and innovation strategy?\n\nSo, this answer has two dimensions: the work we do and the team we get to work alongside. One is Magnite’s role and the scale at which we operate. Magnite has incredible scale across all the leading media formats. Our ability to connect buyers with sellers’ inventory and influence consumers is immense. It’s a real privilege and an honor to build and innovate on this stage.\n\nI enjoy the mix of creativity and problem-solving. I like to sit at the dreaming level and think about things that don’t exist and the detailed technology needed to make them work. We often flip-flop between those two categories before merging them together.\n\nOur approach is a constant mix of “What does the market say? What do our clients say that they think they need? What do they not say that you have to interpret?” From there, our vision unfolds. Sometimes, these are linear, incremental innovations. And sometimes, these things are brand new and bring something to the market that hasn’t been asked for. Some of the most interesting things come from that because you show up with something, and clients say, “I didn’t even know I needed that.” You have to convince the market and help the market evolve in a certain way.\n\nThe other part of my role that motivates me is building the team and developing not just a product team but a cross-functional team to innovate, think differently, and bring these products to market.\n\nMagnite operates in a rapidly evolving landscape. How do you approach product development to ensure Magnite stays ahead of the curve?\n\nThat is the delicate art and dance that we have to do. It’s a constant balance of doing what is requested by clients specifically and pushing forward things on our own that we believe the industry needs. There’s really no perfect science to it. You have to be able to say “no” to a lot. In product management, we say “no” or more like “no, not this quarter” way more often than we say “yes.”\n\nWith so many stakeholders in ad tech (advertisers, publishers), how do you balance their needs when prioritizing product features?\n\nWe balance the portfolio and allocate our resources towards our different product lines, dedicating percentages of our product and engineering resources to work on each. That rebalancing happens at the executive leadership team level. However, once that allocation is set within the product lines, those product managers and engineering leaders are free to prioritize however they see appropriate. As a company, we first build heavier on the ad server and publisher side. We balance that out with products that benefit our marketers, whether it’s for the brands, the agencies, or the DSPs so that they can buy our inventory fairly, transparently, and advantageously.\n\nWhat exciting product innovations are currently in the pipeline at Magnite? Can you give us a sneak peek?\n\nWe’re excited about a lot of things coming to market. We are working on a single sign-on and universal navigation between Magnite Streaming and SpringServe for a seamless user experience. We want our publisher clients who use both products to feel like it’s one product. We also are building out our identity suite and scaling it to suit the needs of our clients. Curated Marketplaces is on track to add targeting and features to DV+ and add capabilities to our self-service workflow for streaming inventory.\n\nWe have advanced forecasting that’s hitting the market. We’re also looking into new investments, specifically in live television, and expanding upon our initial success with Tiles into other formats. This is innovation and the redefinition of the advertising experience for connected television.\n\nNow for something fun! Tell us about the first concert you ever attended.\n\nRolling Stones at Shea Stadium. Living Colour opened up for that. It was a great concert with a bunch of my friends from high school, and we had a blast!",
