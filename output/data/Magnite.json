      "# [Open Bidding FAQ on 2023-09-01](https://www.magnite.com/openbiddingfaq/)\n1. I reviewed the Terms & Conditions and found some language that I was not comfortable agreeing to. Can I propose changes/redlines?\n\nUnfortunately, given the high volume of Google Open Bidding publishers who are participating in this program, Magnite is unable to accommodate any custom changes/redlines to the Terms & Conditions at this time.\n\n2. How long does it normally take Magnite to review my submission?\n\nMagnite is doing its best to expedite the review of each submission and expects the review process to normally take up to three business days. Magnite thanks you for your patience as this new Open Bidding program is rolled out.\n\nIf approved, Magnite will require that you update your Ads.txt/App-Ads.txt file in order to monetize your inventory. It is recommended that you get a head start by inserting the following line item:\n\nrubiconproject.com, 22884, DIRECT, 0bfd66d529a55807\n\nMagnite also recommends that you bookmark the Google OB Terms you consented to by bookmarking the following URL. This will allow you to access these legal terms for future reference.\n\n4. It’s been a week. Will I receive email notification from Magnite once I am approved or rejected?\n\nDue to the high volume of submissions, Magnite will not be able to send you a separate email notification once your inventory starts monetizing. However, your application’s status will appear in your applicable Bidder’s UI interface (Google Ad Manager or Google Admob) as one of three statuses:\n\n“Pending” – your submission is still under review\n\n“Approved” – your submission was approved and monetization should begin soon\n\n“Rejected” – your submission was rejected\n\n5. When I checked my status in my Google Bidder’s UI interface (AdManager or Admob), it shows my status as “rejected.” How can I find out the reasons for the rejection? Is there a way I can appeal the decision?\n\nDue to the high volume of submissions received and Magnite’s focus on reviewing all submissions as quickly as possible, Magnite is unable to provide detailed rejection reasons or offer a path to appeal at this time. To increase your chances of approval, please make sure to provide detailed & accurate information when initially submitting your information.\n\n6. I did not enter any billing information when I submitted my form. How will Magnite provide me performance reporting and know how to pay me?\n\nOne of the value propositions of the Google Open Bidding program is to offer publishers consolidated billing/reporting. Google will be providing you performance reporting and remitting payments directly to you. You will not receive a login to the Magnite platform.\n\n7. What ad formats or sizes does Magnite support?\n\nMagnite supports monetization across a wide variety of ad formats and industry-standard sizes, including desktop web, mobile web, mobile app, and video. Ad formats include, but are not limited to, banners, interstitials, in-stream or outstream, and rewarded video.\n\n8. Which countries is Magnite able to do business with under this program?\n\nIf your inventory becomes approved, and as long as your company is not registered to do business in, nor has its principal place of business located in, any of the countries listed HERE, then you are eligible to work with Magnite.\n\n9. What if I have new domains or app bundles that I wish to monetize with Magnite, but were not included in my original submission? How do I get those approved?\n\nIf you have new inventory that Magnite hasn’t reviewed, please provide your Google Publisher ID and any new domain and/or app bundle details to Magnite’s email alias of OBSupport@magnite.com. If/when it is approved, you can begin sending that inventory to Magnite for monetization.\n\n10. I have ad inventory available for monetization from many different countries. Which countries will Magnite be able to monetize?\n\nThere are some exceptions, but you can expect Magnite to be able to monetize a wide array of ad formats in most major countries around the world.\n\n11. I don’t have my Google Publisher ID readily available. Is that going to be a problem to get approved?\n\nIt is important that you provide your Google Publisher ID when submitting your application to Magnite. If you are having trouble locating your Google Publisher ID, you can click here if you are an Admob publisher and click here if you are a Google Ad Manager publisher for more information. Please also note that if you require additional email support for any reason after your submission, please make sure to include your Google Publisher ID in your email inquiry to expedite a reply from Magnite.\n\n12. I still have additional unanswered questions. Should I email my Google or my Magnite representative?",

I have stock in Magnite and I have been watching this companies stock drop day after day. It makes me wonder if there is something going on behind the scenes or if there is some underlying issue causing this to drop day after day after day. It could just be because it’s not as speculative an investment as say Pubmatic or TTD. \n\nI know this Reddit sub is for programmatic discussion so feel free to share insights or anything you might find related to this. I mainly wanted to hear some other peoples opinions on MGNI. \n\nThanks for reading!\n\n## Comment ID hmmfwfb with +6 score by [(OutMotoring, Reddit, 2021-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/r5d6j5/magnite_stock_price/hmmfwfb/) (in reply to ID r5d6j5):\nP/E ratio is $408.00. It is way over-valued. Compared that with TTD’s $190 but the market loves TTD to support their Price/Earnings. I would also look at their balance sheet ie debt.\n\n### Comment ID hmmnmcg with +2 score by [(Drewbtube7, Reddit, 2021-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/r5d6j5/magnite_stock_price/hmmnmcg/) (in reply to ID hmmfwfb):\nGotcha!

If demand is low they  can buy cheaper. \n\nSell side (Magnite) has more of a dependency on demand to make the whole operation worthwhile. They also want to keep in good standing with great publishers competing against Google and Amazon is difficult as they have competitive advantages (search/YouTube and e-commerce retargeting).\n\nOTT and CTV are still not as big as YouTube and Facebook video ads. These companies receive ad dollars first.\n\n### Comment ID hmobcue with +1 score by [(Drewbtube7, Reddit, 2021-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/r5d6j5/magnite_stock_price/hmobcue/) (in reply to ID hmob4mf):\nThank you for the insight!

The reason for loss is due to \"Auctions Lost\", which is frustrating because we don't have control over the bid since its a PG deal. We are also only receiving roughly 10% of the impressions needed to fulfill the PG deal. So if we ordered 1 Million impressions, the deal would only send over 100K for the lifetime of the campaign. My experience with other PG partners is that if we order 1 Million impressions, the deal will actually send over way more impressions than needed to ensure we deliver in full.

Usually it’s something related to creatives that isn’t apparent until the full tag gets sent. I’m probably oversimplifying (because this part is over my head) but it seems like the DSP knows you sent a bid to the external auction, and knows you didn’t win, so it gets classified as “auction loss” even though you may have a winning bid but some other technical issue. In my experience, if there is an issue it’s either creative/tagging incompatibility (your publisher should be be able to confirm/give more insight) or something like your advertiser category being disallowed from serving on specific content (think alcohol/tobacco brands, explicit content, etc)\n\nFundamentally, if the publisher guarantees a certain amount of impressions, it’s on them to ensure you win enough auctions to fulfill that deal and 10% is very low for PG deals, especially if the total bid request volume available isn’t enough in the first place.\n\n## Comment ID jk9kxac with +2 score by [(BestAd1682, Reddit, 2023-05-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/13d71zp/issues_with_nbc_pg_deals_delivering_through_dv360/jk9kxac/) (in reply to ID 13d71zp):\nIt's interesting - I never thought there would be scaling issues with PG deals.

However, Walmart does not offer this type of service. \n\nWalmart has their own DSP, built on top of the Trade Desk, where you build custom audiences based on past purchases of specific SKUs tied to your brand. You can also create custom audiences of purchasers based on an entire category.  In addition, there are pre-built Persona segments like Busy Families and demo segments that you can tap into. You can also use non-Walmart data segments, and they are tapped into most SSPs, so it truly is a full on DSP\n\nBecause they own their DSP, they are able to see the entire bid stream, which is how they figure out the attribution. They're keep track of everyone that your campaign served an impression to by utilizing some form of anonymized ID,  and if a person then makes a purchase, they will attribute that purchase and revenue to your campaign. This is typically tracked through credit card # and email addresses to create their own proprietary ID graph and tying it back to the anonymized ID in the bid stream. They utilize a 14 day and a 30 day lookback window - anybody who was served an ad but made a purchase outside of these windows will not be attributed. They also have a machine learning product to tie back \"cash paying customers\" to the campaign (which I don't really believe is that accurate and inflates their revenue numbers).\n\nEssentially, a PMP offering wouldn't allow for matching up of users targeted vs users who bought, because the audiences gets ported out of the attribution ecosystem (if that makes any sense). It could technically be done if you sent over the exposure log files from the DSP to the PMP partner in order for them to actually attempt to do anything, but I'm not actually aware of any company who actually does this.\n\nSo to answer your questions:\n\n1. Xandr isn't involved in the situation, apart from maybe their supply that the DSP can tap into.\n\n2. Matching IDs from targeting and tying it back to their own propriety ID graph.\n\n3. PMP isn't possible here, and in the Walmart DSP, they're connecting to supply vendors just like any other DSP and bidding in real time.\n\n### Comment ID lqb496q with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1fvz91i/can_someone_explain_whats_going_on_behind_the/lqb496q/) (in reply to ID lqazwnj):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID lqbfted with +3 score by [(shooin13, Reddit, 2024-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1fvz91i/can_someone_explain_whats_going_on_behind_the/lqbfted/) (in reply to ID lqb496q):\nYou’ve got it right – for accurate in-store attribution, the retailer typically needs to have control over both the buy-side (DSP) and the supply-side (SSP). This allows them to track the full chain of ad impressions and tie them back to purchases, using things like loyalty programs, credit card data, or proprietary ID graphs.\n\nIn a PMP setup, it becomes more challenging to match users and attribute in-store sales because the data often exits the retailer's ecosystem. That kind of attribution is more feasible when the retailer owns or manages both sides, making the integration seamless.\n\nIf the retailer isn’t directly managing both sides, achieving in-store attribution through a PMP would require more complex integrations, such as using exposure log files from the DSP to attempt that matching, but that’s far from a standard practice today.\n\n#### Comment ID lqbdbmm with +2 score by [(workredditaccount555, Reddit, 2024-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1fvz91i/can_someone_explain_whats_going_on_behind_the/lqbdbmm/) (in reply to ID lqb496q):\nAll good.

If the targeted user completes a purchase for the advertisers item, they are able to tie it back to an exposure. \n\nNot sure what the inventory is, but I imagine some of it is on the Walmart site.

It manages Retailer A's ad inventory, facilitates the creation of Private Marketplace (PMP) deals, and integrates with Retailer A's first-party data to enable audience targeting. \n\nWalmart likely uses a combination of methods to link online ad exposure to in-store purchases, such as loyalty programs, email matching, device ID tracking, etc.\n\nThe inventory in the PMP likely comes from a combination of sources. This includes Retailer A's own digital properties, such as their website and mobile app. It may also include inventory from partner networks with which Walmart has established agreements. Additionally, Walmart might secure some inventory through programmatic guaranteed deals with various publishers, which they then include in the PMP offering. Rather than pre-purchasing inventory to resell, Walmart is more likely curating a package of their own and partner inventory, making this bundle available to selected advertisers through the PMP. This approach allows Walmart to offer a diverse range of ad placements while maintaining control over who can access this premium inventory.\n\n## Comment ID lqe18es with +1 score by [(zeplin_fps, Reddit, 2024-10-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1fvz91i/can_someone_explain_whats_going_on_behind_the/lqe18es/) (in reply to ID 1fvz91i):\nI’m wondering if OP actually meant Walmart DSP.

All good then, haha\n\n\nIm going to use different examples to mitigate confusion. \n\nYou = programmatic trader for Burger King,\nDSP = DV360,\nSSP = Magnite\n\n\nBurger King collects data. Commonly a collection of cookie IDs of people they think are interested in Burger King. This data is pushed to DV360. You can now apply it as an audience in DV360 to only target these people. \n\nAt this point, you have an audience, but no *inventory*. \n\nSo, you reach out to Magnite. You tell them about the campaign and say you want a PMP of food-related inventory. Magnite, who owns inventory across many many sites, curates a list for you and builds a deal in their platform. \n\nSince this is a private marketplace deal, they only want Burger King to use it. Rather than pushing it so everyone on DV360 can use it, they push it to the Burger King seat in DV360. To do this, they need the seat ID from you. \n\nOnce pushed, they’ll give you the deal ID. You can now accept the deal using this ID in DV360. Once accepted, you can apply it to the campaign.\n\nIf you didn’t need a curated PMP or a preferred rate, you could just use the existing inventory in DV360, no need to reach out to Magnite. You could then apply a site list to curate the inventory yourself. \n\n\nNow you activate the campaign. The DSP keeps the bid request data for all impressions served. Maybe it’s the device ID, maybe IP, email. The information isn’t important. The fact is, data for each user served is stored. \n\nNow, Burger King collects data as well. Maybe they are tracking the IPs of users that connect to their WiFi. Maybe they are tracking people within a certain radius of their stores. Maybe they are getting device info tied to credit card transactions. There are many methods, but if this data can be tied back to the impression data in DV360, a conversion is attributed to the campaign.\n\nOffline measurement is tough and far from perfect. There are offline measurement partners such as Inmarket or Foursquare that make it easier. They can help with the attribution process. They can also measure foot traffic of a particular store to measure lift as well. \n\n\n\nI think a big part is your confusion of terms. PMP is a private marketplace deal. This is inventory. Sites, apps, streaming services, etc. Audiences are digital “pools” of users, commonly cookie IDs. \n\nAudience = People,\nDeal/PMP = Inventory\n\nInventory is of course mandatory. You need to buy as space in order to deliver an impression. Audiences are optional. They are just used as a way to slim down the targeting in order to reach more focused users.\n\n## Comment ID lqf6aga with +1 score by [(BidTheory, Reddit, 2024-10-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1fvz91i/can_someone_explain_whats_going_on_behind_the/lqf6aga/) (in reply to ID 1fvz91i):\nThat specific PMP traffic and audience represents a very small part of the total bidstream available in the market. Xandr has a role making sure their pre-targeting sends as much traffic (bid requests) as possible for that specific traffic so you can bid on it. Normally the SSP should give priority to PMP traffic versus general open market traffic to make sure the DSP gets as much of it as possible.\n\nIt doesn’t make sense for DSPs (or SSPs) to exchange traffic none of the DSPs campaigns are bidding for or buying. A running PMP likely has an active buyer in the DSP and therefore the SSP (Xandr) should make sure as much of that as possible gets through so you can buy it.",

Kia is sitting there with Sonet which has the interior quality from two segments above, but Kiger is there with rattly plastic. Your average 10L spending customer is no longer interested in products that feels cheaper and hence why you see Nissan do the sensible thing and improve the interior of the Magnite even if they haven't made any substantial change.\n\nAs an example, when I was buying a small hatch, I actually looked at amaze, it's a very superior car for my purpose. But, I couldn't sell it to my family because of the lacklustre Honda sales reception, the bare-bones interiors, colour choices and to a large extent a dull test ride. What I am noticing obviously is as people's quality of life and financial potential improves, they are looking for good presentation, especially when they are shelling out on big products.\n\nAll the things said above magnifies dramatically once they look at a product line from Hyundai, Kia and even Tata and Mahindra in this price range. You can Kiger is a solid 1L or 2L cheaper, but when people look at Venue they will check out the i20 and even the bottom segment i10 grand nios. It all feels very premium and well put together, and not like they are being sold something cheap with compromises. When you go to the Tata or Mahindra, your family will check out the XUV 700 and Harriers. They would rather buy something that's a segment below from a brand that offers Harrier than a showroom that's sitting there with one car that doesn't feel as premium.\n\nSo, they have to bring the products quality to at least the old Duster level to survive in the market, then the service and sales experience factors in.\n\n### Comment ID lshx9rn with +5 score by [(sid3091, Reddit, 2024-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lshx9rn/) (in reply to ID lsbnsqh):\n> Your average 10L spending customer is no longer interested in products that feels\n\nYou're not getting a sonet at 10 lacs, my guy.

It also comes kitted with front parking sensor and auto headlamps; hence why you see a lot of people buying the HTK and HTK+.

The non turbo engine sucks and the turbo one is just satisfactory, especially in the AMTs and many city drivers are going towards automatics even at low price points.\n\n2. India has also seen a shift where many people have started at least thinking of Safety in their top 5 requirements. \n\n3. Also Renault has always been seen as a budget brand because their only car that did respectable numbers after the duster is the Kwid. Renault’s fault for not bringing updated Duster in time to take advantage of the booming SUV market despite the fact that Duster could be considered one of the cars that popularised SUVs in city households. \n\n4. The consumer in that price bracket is more concerned with Fuel Efficiency (Maruti’s strength) than with Ride Comfort (Renault’s only redeeming feature) and since neither offers the better safety they go with Maruti/Hyundai.\n\n### Comment ID lsbt5p5 with +7 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lsbt5p5/) (in reply to ID lsbpzvz):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID lshxork with +2 score by [(sid3091, Reddit, 2024-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lshxork/) (in reply to ID lsbt5p5):\n> 3 more bhp at 17 lakhs on road\n\nAnd 20NM less torque :P\n\n## Comment ID lscjmvz with +3 score by [(HistoricalSeason432, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/1g5jgwc/why_renault_kiger_is_not_considered_as_best_but/lscjmvz/) (in reply to ID 1g5jgwc):\nKiger and Magnite( turbo variants) are Punch/Altroz/Exter/Baleno rivals. You get better ground clearance, better engine,  more space in Kiger. \n\nNexon/Sonet/Venue are better cars. But they also demand at least 3lakh premium over similar spec Kiger/Magnite variants. That is almost 4 years of fuel for a guy with low running. \n\n1 more thing that is very less talked about is the good reliability of these cars. My Kiger is almost 2.5 years old, I have never gone to the service center for anything other than my regular service work. Everything in car just works.

Firstly, the looks are stunning (especially my red and black one). Secondly, it’s very spacious; passengers have no complaints of headroom or legroom or even boot space. Thirdly, it’s very feature rich. Doesnt have a sunroof, sure, but it has keyless entry, wireless charger, wireless android auto and apple carplay, folding orvms, and ample amount of storage.

The demand for digital advertisements has increased due to the growing popularity of streaming services, and I expect this industry to do very well in the next few years. I’d like to know opinions on which of these three companies are best positioned to take advantage of the expanding advertising space. \n\nOverview:\n\n**MGNI - Magnite**\n\nMarket Cap: $3.40 billion \n\nLast Quarter revenue: $60.98 million\n\nEPS: 0.06\n\nMagnite, Inc. operates an independent sell-side advertising platform in the United States and internationally. Its omnichannel advertising platform enables publishers to monetize various auction types and formats, including CTV, desktop display, video, audio, and mobile, as well as allows agencies and brands to access brand-safe ad inventory and execute advertising transactions. The company is based in Los Angeles, California. \n\n**PERI - Perion Network Ltd.**\n\nMarket Cap: $321.21 million\n\nLast quarter revenue: $83.41 million\n\nEPS: 0.08\n\nPerion Network Ltd., a technology company, delivers advertising solutions to brands, agencies, and publishers in North America, Europe, and internationally. The company develops digital advertising solutions to capture consumer attention and drive engagement, as well as delivers ads across a portfolio of Websites and mobile applications. Its proprietary social marketing platform offers a dashboard for marketers that make media buying efficient on Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, and other social networks and platforms. The company's platform allows advertisers to control their marketing expenditures, in-house planning and strategy, and utilize the technical tool to create operational marketing efficiencies. In addition, it provides search-based monetization solutions for publishers with analytics capabilities to track and monitor their business performance; Smilebox that enables people to tell the stories of their lives with customizable eCards, slideshows, invitations, and collages; and IncrediMail a messaging application that enables consumers to manage various email accounts in one place. The company was formerly known as IncrediMail Ltd. and changed its name to Perion Network Ltd. in November 2011. Perion Network Ltd. was incorporated in 1999 and is headquartered in Holon, Israel.\n\n**PUBM - PubMatic, Inc.**\n\nMarket Cap: $1.28 billion\n\nLast quarter earnings: $34.39 million \n\nEPS: 0.25\n\nPubMatic, Inc. provides a cloud infrastructure platform that enables real-time programmatic advertising transactions worldwide. Its platform supports an array of ad formats and digital device types, including mobile app, mobile web, desktop, display, video, over-the-top, connected television, and media. The company was founded in 2006 and is headquartered in Redwood City, California. PubMatic had their IPO in early December 2020. \n\n\nI think all three stocks are good buys, with PERI being the most undervalued at the moment. If anyone has anything to add it would be much appreciated!\n\n## Comment ID gi79byj with +16 score by [(cold-brew-101, Reddit, 2021-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kr2jlk/mgni_peri_or_pubm/gi79byj/) (in reply to ID kr2jlk):\nYou'll want to get into PERI, it is a company that has raised guidance twice this year and is seeing a resurgence in growth.

Because of a thing called 'header bidding', most SSPs all tend to sell more or less the same supply as each other though you have some like Triplelift that specialize in native ads (ads that seem more like organic content).\n\nI *think* there's more value in companies like LiveRamp that's a data platform especially as there is continuously growing interest/concern around data privacy but it doesn't really appear to be reflected in their stock price.\n\n### Comment ID gi7hxwu with +3 score by [(2toness, Reddit, 2021-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kr2jlk/mgni_peri_or_pubm/gi7hxwu/) (in reply to ID gi7ekbr):\nWhat is your sentiment on MGNI then?\n\n#### Comment ID gi8t7uj with +5 score by [(Cheesepuff_BeanDip, Reddit, 2021-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kr2jlk/mgni_peri_or_pubm/gi8t7uj/) (in reply to ID gi7hxwu):\nMGNI provides massive ad placement reach/scale, full transparency into their auction process, and also partners with TTD/LiveRamp on forward-thinking projects like Unified ID.  \n\n\nPubMatic is an SSP that I often disable from campaigns I run.

I think they're the first big supply side partner to get involved so points for that. For reference - Unified ID 2.0 is perceived to be very important for the business with cookies and such going away. I have a positive view of their CEO too who's a seasoned adtech vet.\n\nI don't really know their financials or their growth but their stock 4Xing over the past year seems like .... an overvaluation and just riding the coattails of TTD though. They haven't exactly done anything to warrant all that hype but I suppose it's been a huge bull market. There was some excitement a while back about their sole partnership with Hulu but I think that's no longer exclusive to Magnite\n\nIf you're deciding between these though, just dump your money into Magnite or TTD lol.\n\n## Comment ID gi7tmv6 with +5 score by [(play_it_safe, Reddit, 2021-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kr2jlk/mgni_peri_or_pubm/gi7tmv6/) (in reply to ID kr2jlk):\nThere are others, too. \n\nMAX, IBEX, FLNT, BCOV\n\nAlso, you left out the most important part: how much they're growing and future trajectories.\n\n### Comment ID gi7xydc with +3 score by [(SaveThemTurdles, Reddit, 2021-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kr2jlk/mgni_peri_or_pubm/gi7xydc/) (in reply to ID gi7tmv6):\nThanks, Haven’t looked into those yet. \n\nMGNI has the best YOY growth of the three. \n\nPERI has consistent growth over the last three quarters and I think next earnings will continue the trend.

They are all turnaround plays!!!\nIt's not a growth stock!!!\n\nThis seems like a lot of confidence for a company that most recently grew only 12% year over year.\n\nI know the headline ran with 62% growth and some of the financial sites show that 62% as well. But from their own quarterly press release, that is not the actual growth rate. \n\nMagnite revenue was $61.0 million for Q3 2020, up 62% from Q3 2019 on an as reported basis and up 12% on a pro-forma basis\n\nThird quarter 2020 financial results of Magnite represent the combined performance of Rubicon Project and Telaria, which merged on April 1, 2020. Third quarter 2019 comparative numbers do not include results from Telaria, unless noted as pro-forma.\n\nTelaria was around a $15M/quarter company. So the 62% doesn’t take into account nearly 25% of the combined company total revenue into the comparable. And when you look at the comparable it’s only 12% growth for the combined company. \n\nFurther the mobile and desktop grew about 3% YoY. And CTV accounted for $11M and 18% of revenue and grew at 51%. At $11M that should be growing near triple digits to be anywhere near matching the narrative. $11M and 51% are pathetically small numbers for what should be a hypergrowth market. And that CTV growth rate has fallen like a rock every quarter.\n\nThe guidance is similarly weak at $75M at top of guide. The Q4 combined comparable is $68.1M, implying 10-11% growth. Q4 is a seasonally larger quarter for both of the Magnite companies. As typical you can expect Q1 guide to show a decline QoQ. And probably continued 10-12% growth.\n\nAnnual Revenues from the past few years:\n\n2016: 278M\n2017:155M -44% YoY\n2018:124M -20% YoY\n2019: 156M +26% YoY\n\n\nThis is clearly a \"hope for a turnaround\" company and not a high growth company!!!\n\n## Comment ID gkrrz6h with +1 score by [(Aside_Much, Reddit, 2021-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kr2jlk/mgni_peri_or_pubm/gkrrz6h/) (in reply to ID kr2jlk):\nGreat write up!    \nTake a look at Comscore / $SCOR.

The bigger content businesses are multi platform; they lean towards solutions which can handle all of it like freewheel.\n\n### Comment ID i6lj6uv with +1 score by [(federoll, Reddit, 2022-04-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/udwrh9/which_ctv_adtech_should_we_use/i6lj6uv/) (in reply to ID i6l60v2):\nYes, the idea is to have a solution 100% focused on CTV\n\n## Comment ID ii2hepx with +2 score by [(Individual-Round2908, Reddit, 2022-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/udwrh9/which_ctv_adtech_should_we_use/ii2hepx/) (in reply to ID udwrh9):\nCheck out Column6 .. White label CTV ad server + unified auction. Hands down the best overall package (tech/support/marketplace)\n\n## Comment ID i6lia3w with +2 score by [(Hallowindo, Reddit, 2022-04-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/udwrh9/which_ctv_adtech_should_we_use/i6lia3w/) (in reply to ID udwrh9):\ndef not GAM, its a nightmare.\n\n## Comment ID jpn4u86 with +1 score by [(Troyboyroy61, Reddit, 2023-06-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/udwrh9/which_ctv_adtech_should_we_use/jpn4u86/) (in reply to ID udwrh9):\nYou folks here seem to know a lot about 1P ad servers...do y'all have any insight into pricing for them - e.g., GAM 360, Freewheel, SpringServe, etc.?"

It worked better than I thought it would. But like most other corporations, stop with the drum beating and emptiness of setting goals as if we are cattle to be herded and prodded. Goal-setting itself isn't the problem -- the way it is forced and meaningless is. You want employees that *want* on their own to make the company better ... right? At least one of the subsidiaries you acquired had a better way of achieving this than you do. And this isn't nostalgia or hurt due to change. It doesn't have to be like that subsidiary ... but you could learn a lot from what worked there to be better than just cookie-cutter-corporate a lot of the time.",

          "cons": "Magnite pay is well below industry standard. I was told by HR when leaving the company that Magnite does not want to be known as a top paying company. This leads mid/junior employees to have higher turnover rates than expected.\n\nA lot of teams are very top-heavy, which leaves no room or possibility for others to get promoted. I was at Magnite for over 5 years, and we never once did a proper year end, employee evaluation. At other companies, you typically do your evaluation with your manager in December, who then provides feedback on how to grow in your career. Where you stand in terms of performance should not be a surprise, but at Magnite it is. When January comes around, random people get promoted, and your manager will just look at you shrug and say there wasn't enough budget for anyone else to get promoted. Given promotions only happen once a year, this is an extremely upsetting situation to be in, and is the exact reason why many people leave the company. \n\nEach team's RTO is different. Understandably, RTO is the new normal, but then everyone should be held to the same standard. There are engineers that need to be in the office 3x a week, but then several SALES people are allowed to work completely remote? People who lead large teams are completely remote? The company needs a more fair stance. It seems only senior level people at the company got permission to be remote, while everyone else is held to a different standard.",

C-level management was either incompetent or so out of touch they end up being incompetent, I couldn't tell. Middle management is a bunch of yes-men (men, no women) who aggressively play the \"just go with it even though it's a bad plan, it will get fixed eventually\" card and as far as I can tell they are all highly loaded with stock and just playing a waiting game to dump it all as soon as it vests.. I can't blame them there. Day to day is a slew of overstaffed meetings that should have been (or already were) tracked issues and don't really accomplish anything with some spurts of work thrown in. At SpotX I would be able to get about 20-25 hours per 40hr week of active work completed and Magnite I was peaking in the mid to low teens. It seems from my view that every piece of infrastructure is set up by only skimming documentation and then getting it to a place at which it just barely functions then moving on and never ever coming back to get it out of alpha stage. Bugs become features, duct tape becomes structural and all that. Honestly I have never seen a more toxic work environment. The back to office mandate that all but management follows was a cherry. I loved spotx because of the teams and attitude of all trying to push in the same direction and we all tried that at magnite when we got acquired.. and got promptly thrown under every bus they could find. I'm glad I got a package, others were not so lucky. Beware of the politics in middle management, some of them can lie very well, and pay attention to who is the one pulling their strings. Check the companies cycle of funding, quarterly reports and then immediate stock dumps by all employees.",

Middle management is a bunch of yes-men (men, no women) who aggressively play the \"just go with it even though it's a bad plan, it will get fixed eventually\" card and as far as I can tell they are all highly loaded with stock and just playing a waiting game to dump it all as soon as it vests.. I can't blame them there. Day to day is a slew of overstaffed meetings that should have been (or already were) tracked issues and don't really accomplish anything with some spurts of work thrown in. At SpotX I would be able to get about 20-25 hours per 40hr week of active work completed and Magnite I was peaking in the mid to low teens. It seems from my view that every piece of infrastructure is set up by only skimming documentation and then getting it to a place at which it just barely functions then moving on and never ever coming back to get it out of alpha stage. Bugs become features, duct tape becomes structural and all that. Honestly I have never seen a more toxic work environment. The back to office mandate that all but management follows was a cherry. I loved spotx because of the teams and attitude of all trying to push in the same direction and we all tried that at magnite when we got acquired.. and got promptly thrown under every bus they could find. I'm glad I got a package, others were not so lucky. Beware of the politics in middle management, some of them can lie very well, and pay attention to who is the one pulling their strings.

This leads mid/junior employees to have higher turnover rates than expected.\n\nA lot of teams are very top-heavy, which leaves no room or possibility for others to get promoted. I was at Magnite for over 5 years, and we never once did a proper year end, employee evaluation. At other companies, you typically do your evaluation with your manager in December, who then provides feedback on how to grow in your career. Where you stand in terms of performance should not be a surprise, but at Magnite it is. When January comes around, random people get promoted, and your manager will just look at you shrug and say there wasn't enough budget for anyone else to get promoted. Given promotions only happen once a year, this is an extremely upsetting situation to be in, and is the exact reason why many people leave the company. \n\nEach team's RTO is different. Understandably, RTO is the new normal, but then everyone should be held to the same standard. There are engineers that need to be in the office 3x a week, but then several SALES people are allowed to work completely remote? People who lead large teams are completely remote? The company needs a more fair stance. It seems only senior level people at the company got permission to be remote, while everyone else is held to a different standard.",

Goal-setting itself isn't the problem -- the way it is forced and meaningless is. You want employees that *want* on their own to make the company better ... right? At least one of the subsidiaries you acquired had a better way of achieving this than you do. And this isn't nostalgia or hurt due to change.

      "# [KERV Interactive Partners with Magnite to Deliver AI-Powered Interactive Video Ads Programmatically, at Scale by KarYi Lim on 2024-04-11](https://www.magnite.com/press/kerv-interactive-partners-with-magnite-to-deliver-ai-powered-interactive-video-ads-programmatically-at-scale/)\nAdvertisers Can Access KERV’s Dynamic Video Ads, Coupled with Magnite’s Unmatched Access to Omnichannel Streaming Inventory, Driving Audience Engagement and Shortening the Path to Purchase\n\nAUSTIN, TX – April 11, 2024 – KERV Interactive, the leader in AI-powered video analysis, performance and monetization, and Magnite (NASDAQ: MGNI), the world’s largest independent sell-side advertising company, have joined forces to deliver immersive advertising experiences at scale. Marketers can now layer KERV’s portfolio of AI-powered interactive and shoppable video capabilities across Magnite’s omnichannel inventory from leading publishers.\n\n“Over the past year, we’ve seen a significant increase in demand for highly immersive, interactive programmatic video solutions, underscoring the need for scalable, data-driven interactive and shoppable advertising solutions that capture audience attention and drive meaningful performance,” said Gary Mittman, Founder and CEO at KERV. “We’ve always allowed advertisers to optimize campaign creative based on audience interaction data, and personalize creative based on viewer interests. This partnership with Magnite will now allow brands to activate these capabilities with unparalleled ease and scale.”\n\nLayering interactivity into video creative has been proven to increase brand favorability, consumer intent, and purchase intent by as much as 1.5x (source: Magna Global). And results can be even higher when that interactivity is enhanced with advanced dynamic AI technology.\n\n“We are at an unprecedented time in digital advertising, where AI has the power to transform consumers’ experiences with the content they love and the brands they care about,” said Megan Pagliuca, Chief Activation Officer at Omnicom Media Group. “By connecting KERV’s AI-powered exploration and shoppability solutions with the scaled video supply of Magnite, this partnership helps us future-proof our media investments as part of our larger focus on the intersection of content and commerce.”\n\nWith KERV’s interactive ad capabilities now available through Magnite, buyers now have a simple, fast, and efficient path to a curated supply of KERV’s interactive and shoppable creative ad units. Other benefits include streamlined access to KERV’s portfolio of AI-powered interactive and shoppable video formats across OLV and CTV, in addition to cookie-free first-party targeting capabilities based on KERV’s unique audience identifiers to ensure contextual relevance and brand safety.\n\n“In today’s fiercely competitive media landscape, the ability to dynamically deliver interactive, contextually relevant messages is critical,” said Sean Buckley, Chief Revenue Officer at Magnite. “Our partnership with KERV provides clients with direct access to premium ad inventory while their first-party, real-time data automates and streamlines the creative optimization process, driving maximum impact. This is just the beginning of the ways Magnite and KERV will collaborate to bring innovation to our industry that scales quickly, simply, and efficiently.”\n\nAbout KERV Interactive\n\nKERV Interactive is the leader in AI-powered video analysis, performance and monetization.

      "# [Inside the Magnite C-Suite with Chief Product Officer Adam Soroca by Mariah Cooper on 2024-08-26](https://www.magnite.com/blog/inside-the-magnite-c-suite-with-chief-product-officer-adam-soroca/)\nIn this Q+A, we sit down with Chief Product Officer Adam Soroca to get a behind-the-scenes look at product development at Magnite, his insights on the future of ad tech, and what keeps him motivated and excited about the industry.\n\nMagnite’s C-Suite series provides a unique opportunity to gain firsthand perspectives on critical industry trends and strategic initiatives shaping Magnite’s core values and future.\n\nWhat are you most passionate about in your role as chief product officer at Magnite? What drives your product vision and innovation strategy?\n\nSo, this answer has two dimensions: the work we do and the team we get to work alongside. One is Magnite’s role and the scale at which we operate. Magnite has incredible scale across all the leading media formats. Our ability to connect buyers with sellers’ inventory and influence consumers is immense. It’s a real privilege and an honor to build and innovate on this stage.\n\nI enjoy the mix of creativity and problem-solving. I like to sit at the dreaming level and think about things that don’t exist and the detailed technology needed to make them work. We often flip-flop between those two categories before merging them together.\n\nOur approach is a constant mix of “What does the market say? What do our clients say that they think they need? What do they not say that you have to interpret?” From there, our vision unfolds. Sometimes, these are linear, incremental innovations. And sometimes, these things are brand new and bring something to the market that hasn’t been asked for. Some of the most interesting things come from that because you show up with something, and clients say, “I didn’t even know I needed that.” You have to convince the market and help the market evolve in a certain way.\n\nThe other part of my role that motivates me is building the team and developing not just a product team but a cross-functional team to innovate, think differently, and bring these products to market.\n\nMagnite operates in a rapidly evolving landscape. How do you approach product development to ensure Magnite stays ahead of the curve?\n\nThat is the delicate art and dance that we have to do. It’s a constant balance of doing what is requested by clients specifically and pushing forward things on our own that we believe the industry needs. There’s really no perfect science to it. You have to be able to say “no” to a lot. In product management, we say “no” or more like “no, not this quarter” way more often than we say “yes.”\n\nWith so many stakeholders in ad tech (advertisers, publishers), how do you balance their needs when prioritizing product features?\n\nWe balance the portfolio and allocate our resources towards our different product lines, dedicating percentages of our product and engineering resources to work on each. That rebalancing happens at the executive leadership team level. However, once that allocation is set within the product lines, those product managers and engineering leaders are free to prioritize however they see appropriate. As a company, we first build heavier on the ad server and publisher side. We balance that out with products that benefit our marketers, whether it’s for the brands, the agencies, or the DSPs so that they can buy our inventory fairly, transparently, and advantageously.\n\nWhat exciting product innovations are currently in the pipeline at Magnite? Can you give us a sneak peek?\n\nWe’re excited about a lot of things coming to market. We are working on a single sign-on and universal navigation between Magnite Streaming and SpringServe for a seamless user experience. We want our publisher clients who use both products to feel like it’s one product. We also are building out our identity suite and scaling it to suit the needs of our clients.

      "# [Inside the Magnite C-Suite with Chief People Officer Shawna Hughes by Mariah Cooper on 2025-01-24](https://www.magnite.com/blog/inside-the-magnite-c-suite-with-chief-people-officer-shawna-hughes/)\nIn this Q+A, we sit down with Chief People Officer Shawna Hughes to discuss her passion for fostering a supportive and flexible workplace culture at Magnite, her approach to driving employee development, and the innovative talent strategies she’s implementing to meet the evolving needs of the ad tech industry.\n\nMagnite’s C-Suite series provides a unique opportunity to gain firsthand perspectives on critical industry trends and strategic initiatives shaping Magnite’s core values and future.\n\nAs the Chief People Officer at Magnite, how do you approach fostering a strong workplace culture?\n\nI am focused on the small things that reinforce support and care for our employees. Our approach at Mangite is if you live it, you don’t have to say it.\n\nFinding multiple avenues to show that support in different ways excites me about my job.\n\nWhen it comes to driving the culture, the People team is a conduit. The People team creates and coordinates tools and processes to enable leaders and employees to take ownership of the culture. When everyone feels like they are part of the culture rather than being told what it is, that drives a great workplace.\n\nThe People team looks to foster culture by allowing individual choice. Employees can regularly elect what is important to them. Examples of this include extensive benefits offerings, peer-to-peer recognition and customized awards, tenure recognition, and company donation matching for charitable donations. Employees are offered a number of options and can truly navigate the company in a way that’s customized to them.\n\nIn a fast-evolving industry like ad tech, how do you ensure that Magnite’s talent strategies remain innovative and forward-thinking?\n\nIt goes back to the small things that matter because if you’ve built the foundation of flexibility and multiple avenues of support, you can double down at any moment on one of those. Driving flexibility and creativity in how we support our employees is the foundation of being able to adjust whatever is thrown our way, especially in an environment that’s very focused on costs. It’s not just about programs. It’s also about tools.\n\nFor instance, we recognize the need to broaden our conversations and enhance the tools available so managers and employees can better discuss performance and career development. In response, we rolled out the 9-box evaluation method. This tool evaluates employees on performance and potential growth. We are also transparent about job leveling within the organization. It’s like a compass for employee development—once you know where everyone stands, you can confidently map out the best route forward.\n\nWe offer employees development opportunities and transparency regarding the skills and abilities required for each role and in all functions. We also have an open forum for employees to ask our CEO and other senior leaders questions about the company or industry as a whole.\n\nWith so many teams and personalities at Magnite, how do you balance the varied needs of employees across departments while setting company-wide people initiatives?\n\nWe prioritize getting a lot of feedback. We have an engagement survey for company employees and gather feedback from different steps in the recruiting process. We will not succeed without that feedback. Being proactive about getting feedback is the foundation of what we do. We can’t always say yes at the moment to any given request, just like a product roadmap, but it always goes on the list to build and enhance.\n\nCan you share any programs or initiatives at Magnite that support employee growth and well-being?\n\nThis year, we’re trying to launch more employee-led resource groups. We will keep evolving our performance management process to support ongoing career development. We also offer a lunch program funded by the company that allows people to order lunches instead of catering. This allows individual needs to be met by ordering the food they want to eat and the flexibility to choose when to eat it, unlike a catered lunch, where people cannot choose the food they want to eat and may miss out on getting food due to meetings or other work commitments. I’m very proud of our lunch program.\n\nIf you could instantly master any skill, what would it be?\n\nPersonally, it would be singing—I cannot sing at all! Professionally, it’d be transforming from reactivity to proactivity."
