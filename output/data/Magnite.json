The terms and conditions of the Agreement and the SpringServe Materials are the Confidential Information of Magnite. As to both parties, Confidential Information also includes business and marketing plans, software code, technology and technical information, product and system designs and configurations, specifications, APIs, trade secrets, and business processes.

Such disclosures shall only be made to those third parties who are bound by confidentiality obligations with respect to such Confidential Information that are at least as protective as those set forth herein, and Receiving Party shall be responsible and liable for the failure of any such third party to treat the Confidential Information in accordance with Receiving Party’s obligations.

Receiving Party shall promptly notify Disclosing Party if it becomes aware of any actual or reasonably suspected unauthorized disclosure of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.\n\n(c) Legal Disclosure. If Receiving Party is compelled by law or legal process to disclose the Confidential Information of Disclosing Party, it shall provide Disclosing Party with (i) prompt prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and (ii) reasonable assistance, at Disclosing Party’s expense, if Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. In any event, such disclosure shall be strictly limited to the Confidential Information that is required to be so disclosed by law or legal process.\n\n4.2 Privacy and Data Usage.\n\n(a) Privacy Laws. Customer shall ensure that its use of the SpringServe Materials, including with regard to any data and/or data segments that Customer uploads or has uploaded on its behalf, complies with its obligations under (i) all applicable privacy laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and any other laws materially similar in form or scope to the foregoing, and including any rules promulgated pursuant to the foregoing and each as amended from time to time (collectively, the “State Privacy Laws”), the Regulation 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) (“GDPR”), the GDPR as incorporated into United Kingdom law pursuant to section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal Act) 2018 (“UK GDPR”), and any implementation of the European Union Directive 2002/58/EC (as modified by Directive 2009/136/EC), and any replacement legislation, and (ii) generally accepted privacy self-regulatory guidelines, such as the principles of the Digital Advertising Alliance and the code of the Network Advertising Initiative, as updated, supplemented or amended from time to time, ((i) and (ii), collectively, the “Privacy Laws”). When sending Ad requests to Magnite, Customer shall honor and not inhibit, circumvent, disrupt, or otherwise compromise the actual user choice to opt out (including to opt out of “targeted advertising”, “sharing”, or “sales” of personal data as such terms are defined in the State Privacy Laws), limit ad tracking, or other similar setting or preference, as indicated by the end user, with respect to each applicable application or platform.\n\n(b) Privacy Policies. Customer agrees to post on its website and all Media an up-to-date and accurate privacy policy, and/or provide the appropriate link to such a policy within its Media, that: (i) complies with all applicable Privacy Laws and (ii) accurately discloses all applicable data collection, use, and disclosure practices, including, but not limited to, an explanation of the purposes for which data is collected by or will be transferred to, third parties, the use of cookies, pixels, beacons, locally stored objects, or other similar technologies by third parties for purposes of targeting individual end users with interest-based, and other types of advertisements. Customer and each seller of the Media shall comply with its respective privacy polic(ies). Customer further agrees that its and the Media privacy polic(ies) will provide (i) consumers subject to the State Privacy Laws a functioning method to opt-out of “sales”, “sharing” and “targeted advertising” by the Customer as required by the State Privacy Laws; and (ii) all end users with a conspicuous link to a functional opt-out page. If Customer uses the SpringServe Materials to buy or sell Ad Inventory directly or indirectly on behalf of any third party, Customer will ensure that such third party complies with this Section 4.2.\n\n(c) Data. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, Magnite shall have the right to collect, use, and disclose data transmitted through or otherwise derived from Customer’s use of the SpringServe Materials as described in the applicable Magnite privacy polic(ies).\n\n(d) Required Consent. To the extent that any data, including persistent identifiers (such as IP address or device identifiers) or precise geo-location data, about end users are collected, used, transmitted, or processed by or on behalf of Customer or a party on behalf of which Customer is directly or indirectly buying or selling Ad Inventory using SpringServe Materials, Customer represents and warrants that all necessary disclosures have been provided to and appropriate consents have been or will be obtained from such end user (“Required Consents”), as applicable. These Required Consents include, but are not limited to, those necessary to collect information about individual end users through the use of technologies, such as cookies and pixels, located on the end user’s device, and to pass such information to Magnite for processing in accordance with the Agreement. All Required Consents shall be obtained by Customer before any such technologies are set on the applicable end user’s device, regardless of whether such technologies are set directly by Customer or by or through Magnite. Customer shall not directly or indirectly pass Magnite any information that permanently identifies a particular device.\n\n(e) European Data Protection Law. Magnite collects certain data from Customer’s use of the SpringServe Materials, which may include end user “personal data” as defined in European data protection law (“Personal Data”). Magnite and Customer shall process such personal data as data controllers. Customer and Magnite agree to implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect the Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, loss of integrity, and against all other unlawful forms of processing. Further, Magnite and Customer will not process any Personal Data outside of Europe, unless it first implements appropriate safeguards for the Personal Data that satisfy the requirements of European data protection law.\n\n(f) State Privacy Laws. For purposes of State Privacy Laws, Magnite will receive such personal information as a third party and acts as a controller with respect to such personal information. In the event of changes to the State Privacy Laws or issuance of applicable regulation, court order or governmental guidance relating to the State Privacy Laws, Magnite may modify the terms of the Agreement if such change does not have a material adverse impact on Customer and only if mutually agreed upon in writing. For purposes of this Section 4.2(f), (i) the terms “commercial purpose”, “consumer”, “controller”, “personal information”, “processor”, “process”, “sale”, “share” and “targeted advertising” as used herein have the meanings given in the CCPA and (ii) references to “controller”, “personal information” and “processor” include “business”, “personal data” and “service provider” respectively.\n\nMagnite and Customer will comply with their respective obligations under State Privacy Laws with respect to the processing of personal information governed by the Agreement and, where applicable, will also require that their vendors comply with the same.\n\nWhere processing deidentified data, Magnite and Customer further agree to (i) not attempt to reidentify such data; (ii) use reasonable administrative, technical and organizational measures to prevent reidentification or inadvertent release of the data; and (iii) publicly commit to maintain and use the data in deidentified form and not attempt to reidentify the data.\n\nAdditional CCPA Commitments:\n\nIf personal data is subject to the CCPA, this Section “Additional CCPA Commitments” applies. Magnite will: (i) comply with applicable obligations under the CCPA, including by providing the same level of privacy protection as required of “businesses” under the CCPA; (ii) notify Customer if it can no longer meet its obligations under the CCPA; and (iii) grant Customer the right to take reasonable and appropriate steps to help ensure Magnite is using the personal information in a manner consistent with the CCPA, such as by requesting information or an attestation from Magnite.\n\nIf Customer believes that Magnite is engaged in unauthorized use of personal data provided by Customer, upon notice to Magnite, the Parties will work together in good faith to stop or remediate the allegedly unauthorized use of such personal information, as necessary. Where Magnite receives from Customer personal information subject to the CCPA, Customer makes such personal information available to Magnite for the commercial purposes of performing advertising and related services, as further specified in the Agreement and Magnite will process such personal information only for such purposes and subject to any restrictions outlined in the Agreement.\n\n(g) Kids’ Sites. Customer shall not make Ad Inventory available on a Kids’ Site (as defined below), unless permitted by Magnite in a written amendment signed by both parties. As used herein, “Kids’ Site” refers to any Media: (a) directed to children located in the U.S. (or any U.S. territory thereof) who are under the age of 16; (b) directed to children located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) who are younger than the applicable age required for parental consent; or (c) directed to children, as defined by laws of any other jurisdiction. Customer may not, except to the extent permitted by applicable law, use the SpringServe Materials to: (i) create profiles of visitors of Kids’ Sites or of any users that Customer knows to be under the applicable age of parental consent requirements (“Kids”); (ii) purchase, sell, place, or facilitate the placement of behaviorally targeted Ads on Kids’ Sites; or (iii) collect personal information (as defined by the United States’ Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act), personal data (as defined by GDPR), or comparable data under any similar law of any jurisdiction, about Kids or visitors of Kids’ Sites. Magnite undertakes no obligation to identify Kids Sites or to monitor the compliance of Buyers or Sellers with respect to identifying Kids Sites.\n\nTERM AND TERMINATION\n\n5.1 Term. The Agreement begins on the Effective Date and will continue until terminated as permitted. Each party may terminate the Agreement in whole or terminate any individual Service at any time for any reason, without penalty, by providing thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the other party. The termination of an individual Service will not impact the term of the Agreement or any other Service, unless the provision of another Service depends upon the terminated Service (in which case, both Services will be deemed terminated).\n\n5.2 Suspension; Termination. In addition to its other termination rights specified in the Agreement, Magnite may limit and/or suspend Customer’s access to and use of the SpringServe Materials (including ceasing purchase, sale, delivery, or serving of Ads or Ad Inventory) if Magnite has a reasonable basis to suspect that (a) Customer is violating the terms of the Agreement, (b) Customer’s account remains inactive for at least twelve (12) months, (c) Customer’s use of the SpringServe Materials is likely to damage or cause harm or risk to Magnite, the SpringServe Materials, other customers, or end users of Media or their data, devices, or systems, or (d) Customer becomes insolvent or generally unable to pay its debts as they become due, or becomes the subject of any bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution, or similar proceeding, or has made an assignment for the benefit of creditor or similar disposition of its assets. Magnite will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with notice prior to any limitation or suspension, but in any event will notify Customer promptly thereafter. If an event giving rise to a limitation or suspension is able to be cured (as reasonably determined by Magnite), Customer shall have five (5) days to cure (“Suspension Window”). If Customer has not cured before the expiration of the Suspension Window, or the limitation or suspension is not able to be cured (as reasonably determined by Magnite), then Magnite may terminate the Agreement or any Service in whole or in part upon written notice (email acceptable).\n\n5.3 Effect of Termination. Upon termination of the Agreement or any Service in whole or in part, the following will apply either in total or in relation to the individually terminated Service, as applicable: (a) all access rights granted to the SpringServe Materials shall immediately terminate; (b) Customer will cease all use of SpringServe Materials; and (c) the following will survive: (i) any provisions specified by their terms to survive; and (ii) provisions of the Agreement that, by their nature, are applicable to matters at issue between the parties after termination of the Agreement, such as accrued unpaid payment obligations, limitation of liability, indemnities, confidentiality, and proprietary rights.\n\nREPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; DISCLAIMER\n\n6.1 Mutual Representations and Warranties. Each party represents and warrants to the other that: (a) it has the full corporate right, power, and authority to enter into the Agreement and to exercise its rights and perform its obligations; (b) its execution and delivery of the Agreement, and the performance of its obligations and duties in connection therewith, do not and will not violate any agreement to which it is bound; and (c) it shall comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations in performing its respective obligations and exercising its rights under the Agreement, including with respect to consumer protection and privacy.\n\n6.2 Disclaimer. Except for the express representations and warranties stated herein and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither party makes, and each party expressly disclaims, all representations, conditions, terms and warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the subject matter of the Agreement, including without limitation any implied representation, term, or warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Without limiting the generality of the above and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Magnite makes no representation or warranty (a) as to any Ad or Media or any benefit, performance, or revenues that Customer (or Customer’s clients or users) will obtain from its use of the SpringServe Materials, (b) that any particular Buyer relationships will be established or maintained through the SpringServe Services, (c) that Ads will be available for delivery or at a particular price, or (d) that the SpringServe Materials will be always available or bug or error-free.\n\nINDEMNIFICATION\n\n7.1 Customer Obligations. Subject to Section 7.3, Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Magnite, its permitted successors and assigns, and their respective Affiliates, agents, officers, directors, and employees (collectively, “Magnite Indemnified Parties”) from and against any claims, suits, legal proceedings, regulatory proceedings, or investigatory proceedings (“Claims”) brought against any Magnite Indemnified Party by any third party and any and all judgments, losses, damages, settlements, liabilities, fines, penalties, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) (“Losses”) arising as a result of any such Claim, in each case as a result of or in connection with: (a) any false or misleading representation by Customer or any breach by Customer of any of its warranties or obligations under the Agreement; and (b) a Claim that Media provided or delivered by Customer through the SpringServe Materials, Customer’s Marks, or Customer’s business activities infringe any Intellectual Property Right of any third party ((a) – (b) each being a “Customer Indemnifiable Act”).\n\n7.2 Magnite Obligations. Subject to Section 7.3, Magnite shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Customer, its successors and assigns, and their respective Affiliates, agents, officers, directors, and employees (“Customer Indemnified Parties”) from and against any Claim brought against any Customer Indemnified Party by any third party and any Losses arising as a result of any such Claim, in each case as a result of or in connection with: (a) any false or misleading representation by Magnite or any breach by Magnite of any of its warranties or obligations under the Agreement; or (b) a Claim that the SpringServe Materials, when used in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, infringe any Intellectual Property Right of any third party. In the event a Claim under Section 7.2(b) is made or, in Magnite’s reasonable opinion, is likely to be made, or if required by settlement, Magnite may elect, at its sole option and expense, to: (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the SpringServe Materials that are the subject of such Claim, (ii) replace or modify the SpringServe Materials that are the subject of such Claim to be non-infringing without material decrease in functionality, or (iii) terminate the Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Magnite shall have no liability for any infringement Claim under this Section 7.2 to the extent such Claim results from: (i) modifications to the SpringServe Materials by or on behalf of a Customer Indemnified Party, or (ii) use or combination of any SpringServe Materials with any other item not provided by Magnite; in each case without the prior written consent of Magnite.\n\n7.3 Procedure.\n\n(a) Notice and Reasonable Assistance. In the event of a Claim, the indemnified party shall provide prompt notice of the Claim to the indemnifying party. A failure to provide prompt notice shall not release the indemnifying party from its indemnification obligations under the Agreement, but it will reduce those indemnification obligations by the amount (if any) of additional Losses attributable to the delayed notification. The indemnified party shall also provide reasonable information and assistance needed to defend or settle the Claim (provided the indemnifying party bears any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the indemnified party in providing such assistance or information).\n\n(b) Control of Claim. The indemnifying party of any Claim shall have sole control of the investigation, defense, and settlement of the Claim, provided that the indemnifying party does not enter into any settlement of a Claim that: (i) imposes a monetary obligation on the indemnified party that is not covered by the indemnification; (ii) imposes a material, non-monetary obligation on the indemnified party; (iii) does not include an unconditional release of the indemnified party; (iv) admits liability on the part of the indemnified party; and/or (v) is non-confidential (collectively, the “Settlement Restrictions”). Any settlement that does not comply with the Settlement Restrictions in full will require the prior written consent of the indemnified party.\n\nLIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n\n8.1 Limitations; Liability Cap. SUBJECT TO SECTION 8.2, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL (A) EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR (B) EITHER PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER IN CONNECTION WITH THE AGREEMENT, UNDER ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY, EXCEED U.S. $250,000 (OR ITS EQUIVALENT).\n\n8.2. Exclusions. THE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY SET FORTH IN SECTION 8.1 SHALL NOT APPLY TO: (A) A BREACH OF SECTION 3.1 (RIGHT TO ACCESS AND RESTRICTIONS); (B) A BREACH OF SECTION 4.1 (CONFIDENTIALITY); (C) A CLAIM FOR INDEMNIFICATION UNDER SECTION 7.1; (D) THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, OR FRAUDULENT, CRIMINAL, OR MALICIOUS CONDUCT OF THE PARTY SEEKING TO LIMIT ITS DAMAGES; OR (E) AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO MAGNITE UNDER THE AGREEMENT.\n\nBINDING ARBITRATION & CLASS ACTION WAIVER\n\n9.1 Arbitration. As a material part of the Agreement, any and all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to the Agreement shall be determined exclusively by confidential, final, and binding arbitration as follows:\n\n(a) General. Unless the parties mutually agree to another arbitration service provider, the matters submitted to arbitration shall be heard and determined by a single arbitrator in Los Angeles (or another mutually agreed upon venue), in accordance with the then-existing comprehensive arbitration rules or the streamlined arbitration rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”). Any party to the arbitration may request JAMS to identify panels of retired or former jurists qualified and able to sit as arbitrators of the matters submitted for arbitration and the arbitrator determining the submitted matters shall be selected from such panels pursuant to JAMS rules. Except as otherwise determined by the arbitrator, the fees of the arbitration charged by JAMS initially will be paid equally by both parties. However, the arbitrator shall have the right to order either party to pay all fees and costs as part of the award.\n\n(b) Waiver; Final Award. By agreeing to submit all disputes, claims and controversies to binding arbitration, Customer and SpringServe expressly waive their rights to have such matters heard or tried in court before a judge or jury or in another tribunal. Unless an arbitrator commits errors of law or legal reasoning, any arbitration award shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties, subject only to judicial review provided by statutes governing arbitrations, and a judgment rendered on the arbitration award may be entered in any state or federal court having jurisdiction thereof.\n\n9.2 Class Action Waiver. Customer and Magnite agree that each may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, mass action, or representative action.\n\nTAXES. Customer is solely responsible for payment of any Taxes applicable to its transactions under the Agreement and/or its use of any Service (whether those Taxes are collected and remitted by Magnite or paid directly to the relevant authorities by Customer), except for Taxes based on Magnite’s net income. Customer shall provide Magnite with an IRS form W9 or W-8BEN, as applicable. Upon Magnite’s request and as applicable, Customer shall also provide Magnite with a treaty residency certificate, VAT registration proof, and/or any other relevant documents for tax compliance purposes.\n\nIf and only if Customer is currently based or becomes based (whether as the original Customer or through assignment of this Agreement) in a jurisdiction outside of the United States to which withholding taxes apply, then the following language will also apply: Any applicable Taxes not collected by Magnite from Customer shall be paid by Customer to the relevant authorities directly, and in such circumstances, Customer shall: (a) gross-up such payment to fully-account for such Tax, (b) immediately tender the relevant amount of Tax to the appropriate authorities, and (c) promptly thereafter, inform Magnite in writing that such Taxes have been paid and provide such documentation (including original receipts or other governmental documentation, or copies thereof) as may reasonably be requested by Magnite to ensure that Magnite is satisfied that it will not bear any financial liability of Tax to such authorities in respect of such payment. To the extent that Customer reasonably determines that any payment to Magnite is subject to withholding Tax, Customer shall provide prompt notification to Magnite of such fact in writing, and Magnite shall thereafter provide Customer with a treaty residency certificate, or other similar governmental document, as reasonably requested by Customer.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\n\n11.1 Assignment. Customer may not assign, subcontract, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any or all of its rights and/or obligations under the Agreement without the prior written consent of Magnite (not to be unreasonably withheld). Customer is not required to obtain the prior written consent of Magnite in the event of a Change of Control of Customer, provided that the acquirer(s) assumes Customer’s obligations hereunder after such Change of Control and provided further that the Change of Control does not involve a direct competitor of Magnite, as determined by Magnite in its sole discretion. Customer shall notify Magnite of any Change of Control permitted by this Section 11.1 within 30 days of the consummation thereof. As used herein, “Change of Control” means (a) the merger or consolidation of Customer with another entity; (b) a transaction or series of related transactions in which a third party becomes the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the combined voting power of the outstanding securities of Customer; or (c) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Customer. Any attempted assignment by Customer in breach of this Section 11.1 shall be void. The provisions of the Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties’ respective transferees, successors, and assigns.\n\n11.2 Governing Law; Venue. The Agreement will be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California without reference to conflicts of laws principles. Jurisdiction and venue for all disputes hereunder shall be in Los Angeles County, California. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to the Agreement.\n\n11.3 Non-Exclusive Relationship. The Agreement is non-exclusive and either party may engage in similar or other relationships, agreements, or arrangements with any other party.\n\n11.4 Independent Relationship of the Parties. The relationship between Customer and Magnite (and its personnel or agents) in connection with the Agreement is at all times that of an independent contractor and neither party is an employee, partner, agent, trustee or joint venturer of, for, or with the other. Except to the extent otherwise provided in the Agreement or under applicable law, neither party shall owe any fiduciary or other duties to the other.\n\n11.5 Other Customers. To the extent that another customer of Magnite incurs Losses as a result of any Customer Indemnifiable Act, Customer acknowledges and agrees that such other customer may recover such Losses from Customer directly and will be deemed a third-party beneficiary of this Section 11.5.\n\n11.6 Interpretations. Headings and captions are for convenience only and do not affect the meaning or interpretation of the Agreement. Ambiguities, inconsistencies, or conflicts in the Agreement will be resolved by applying the most reasonable interpretation under the circumstances, giving full consideration to the parties’ intentions at the time the Agreement was entered into and common practice in the industry at that time. The term “including” or “includes” means “including/includes without limitation.” The Agreement shall not be construed against any party by reason of its drafting, preparation, or means of acceptance.\n\n11.7 Public Relations. During the Term of the Agreement, Magnite may use Customer’s Marks in general promotional and informational materials. Except as permitted in the Agreement, neither party shall use the name of the other party in publicity, advertising, or other public materials (unless required by applicable law or regulation) without the prior written consent of the other party.\n\n11.8 Notices. All notices under the Agreement must be made in writing. Notices to Customer shall be made in the applicable user interface (“UI”) for the Service or by email to then-current contact information available to Magnite. Notices to Magnite shall be made by email to legal@magnite.com. Electronic notice will be effective as of the date of posting (for notice within the UI) or as of the sent date (for email notice).\n\n11.9 Advice of Counsel. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL AND HAS READ AND UNDERSTOOD ALL OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THE AGREEMENT.\n\n11.10 Modifications. Magnite will provide Customer with written notice via email or through a general notice displayed within the applicable Service of any material changes (including applicable fees), additions, or deletions to the Agreement applicable to Customer (“Modifications”). If Customer determines in its reasonable discretion that a Modification will have a material, adverse effect on Customer, then for a period of ten (10) business days after the date of notice by Magnite (the “Termination Window”), Customer may, as its sole and exclusive remedy for any Modification, terminate the Agreement upon written notice to Magnite. By continuing to access or use the SpringServe Materials after such Termination Window, Customer agrees to be bound by such Modification.\n\n11.11 Force Majeure. Except for any payment obligations, neither party nor its Affiliates will be liable for any delay or failure to perform hereunder due to circumstances beyond such party’s reasonable control including earthquake, flood, fire, hurricane, tornado, natural disaster, acts of God, riot, national emergency, epidemic or other public health emergency, quarantine, government action or regulation, war, invasion, act of foreign enemies, hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorism, civil war, rebellion, revolution, radiation, other toxic or hazardous contamination, nuclear accident or explosion, restrictions on commodities or supplies, strikes or industrial disputes, or disruptions involving power or infrastructure systems not within such party’s possession or reasonable control (each a “Force Majeure Event”).\n\n11.12 Export Compliance. Customer agrees to comply with the export laws and regulations of the United States and with applicable trade controls of other countries (and that in cases of conflict or inconsistency among applicable export and import laws and regulations, U.S. law shall govern). Customer shall not use the SpringServe Materials to conduct, promote or facilitate business, or target end users in countries subject to U.S. embargo or trade sanctions.\n\n11.13 Anti-Corruption. Customer agrees (a) to comply with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and UK Bribery Act 2010, in relation to the Agreement; and (b) that it will not offer to pay or pay anything of value to anyone, including foreign governmental officials or related persons or entities on Magnite’s behalf.",

I have stock in Magnite and I have been watching this companies stock drop day after day. It makes me wonder if there is something going on behind the scenes or if there is some underlying issue causing this to drop day after day after day. It could just be because it’s not as speculative an investment as say Pubmatic or TTD. \n\nI know this Reddit sub is for programmatic discussion so feel free to share insights or anything you might find related to this. I mainly wanted to hear some other peoples opinions on MGNI. \n\nThanks for reading!\n\n## Comment ID hmmfwfb with +6 score by [(OutMotoring, Reddit, 2021-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/r5d6j5/magnite_stock_price/hmmfwfb/) (in reply to ID r5d6j5):\nP/E ratio is $408.00.

Their revenue is still growing at a decent pace but their margins have gone down fairly significantly, with the combined increased cost of revenue and spending on sales and marketing outpacing revenue growth.

Their stock price will likely stabilize into a new trading range over the next week or two though as the price gets closer to firms' new NPV estimate and selling pressure fades",

Audigent is more of a forward-looking partner in terms of working to reduce the impact of cookie deprecation.

I've been simply reaching out to publishers directly, like PMC for example and making direct deals if their properties are good for target audiences.

I understand the concepts, theoretical and practical, but one thing you can only build with experience is where you rank certain platforms. Most likely, we'll bring someone onto my team for programmatic or go with an agency, but I'd at least like to know what the best DSP platforms for our needs are, as well as which ones to avoid. \n\nWe're mostly looking at advertising on streaming platforms, music and tv/film. \n\nFor context:\n\n\\- We are in health services, specifically urgent care. We also offer primary care and have a line of pediatric care clinics which will likely be the focus of our programmatic advertising (mostly mothers of kids under 11)  \n\\- Main uses will be for platforms like Spotify/Pandora and streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, etc.  \n\\- We have \\~60 locations, mostly in rural areas  \n\\- Budget is fat  \n\\- The head of the department is awesome, mostly because they're me\n\n## Comment ID kgsul3l with +5 score by [(3EsandPaul, Reddit, 2024-01-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1911gd7/best_dsp_for_a_chain_of_urgent_care_clinics_for/kgsul3l/) (in reply to ID 1911gd7):\nBasis or StackAdapt\n\n## Comment ID kgs5gcc with +8 score by [(JimmyTango, Reddit, 2024-01-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1911gd7/best_dsp_for_a_chain_of_urgent_care_clinics_for/kgs5gcc/) (in reply to ID 1911gd7):\nMost major platforms will want a monthly minimum spend, say $50kish per month. Choozle used to be no minimum but I’m not sure what their latest system is. StackAdapt might be worth a look, they play strongly in the local space, not sure how strong their CTV offering is. \n\nNetflix can only be bought via Xandr DSP right now and only as programmatic guarantee.

TTD has prenegotiated deals with most major streaming/ctv/audio publishers. Additionally you want strong reach and graph capabilities in the rural areas along with large data selection which is possible with TTD. The main caveat would be meeting TTD minimums but you could go through a good reseller.\n\n## Comment ID kgsa73e with +1 score by [(OrdinaryInside8, Reddit, 2024-01-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1911gd7/best_dsp_for_a_chain_of_urgent_care_clinics_for/kgsa73e/) (in reply to ID 1911gd7):\nRoku perhaps?

In 2023 I have attempted to have multiple campaigns deliver impressions on Peacock and Livestreaming and every single time we have issues with delivery.  Most of the time we end up only delivering less than 10% of purchased impressions. I never has this issue with Disney or YoutubeTV so I can't fathom why we are having issues with NBC. Their ops team keeps on saying the issue is on our end but that makes no sense as I don't control the settings of a PG deal.

Disney uses a combination of Magnite and GAM depending on if it’s Hulu or Disney XP. Magnite seems to work better these days with DV and GAM is a 1:1 essentially. NBCU is freewheel.

The reason for loss is due to \"Auctions Lost\", which is frustrating because we don't have control over the bid since its a PG deal. We are also only receiving roughly 10% of the impressions needed to fulfill the PG deal. So if we ordered 1 Million impressions, the deal would only send over 100K for the lifetime of the campaign. My experience with other PG partners is that if we order 1 Million impressions, the deal will actually send over way more impressions than needed to ensure we deliver in full. We don't win every impression, but that is kind of the point.\n\n#### Comment ID k8oqxes with +1 score by [(lifesizeisunderrated, Reddit, 2023-11-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/13d71zp/issues_with_nbc_pg_deals_delivering_through_dv360/k8oqxes/) (in reply to ID jjmet87):\nSometimes “Auction Loss” in the DSP troubleshooter isn’t simply losing the auction, but instead something else that isn’t caught in pre-bid stages that’s preventing you from serving the ad. Usually it’s something related to creatives that isn’t apparent until the full tag gets sent. I’m probably oversimplifying (because this part is over my head) but it seems like the DSP knows you sent a bid to the external auction, and knows you didn’t win, so it gets classified as “auction loss” even though you may have a winning bid but some other technical issue. In my experience, if there is an issue it’s either creative/tagging incompatibility (your publisher should be be able to confirm/give more insight) or something like your advertiser category being disallowed from serving on specific content (think alcohol/tobacco brands, explicit content, etc)\n\nFundamentally, if the publisher guarantees a certain amount of impressions, it’s on them to ensure you win enough auctions to fulfill that deal and 10% is very low for PG deals, especially if the total bid request volume available isn’t enough in the first place.\n\n## Comment ID jk9kxac with +2 score by [(BestAd1682, Reddit, 2023-05-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/13d71zp/issues_with_nbc_pg_deals_delivering_through_dv360/jk9kxac/) (in reply to ID 13d71zp):\nIt's interesting - I never thought there would be scaling issues with PG deals.

If you’re applying for in house roles with just 2 years experience, you’re going to be going against people with more experience. Not saying it can’t be done, but just curb your expectations.\n\nMy experience applying for and interviewing for in house roles is that they are less established in their processes and product implementation than an agency role. Being able to evaluate partners and provide POVs is a very valuable skill to set yourself apart. Also, most in house roles I’ve applied for want someone with programmatic, social, and search experience. So your social experience is a good addition.\n\nGood benefits and pay usually come with climbing the career ladder, which is why most people want to climb it.

People aks themselves 'Why should I buy you car from the rest' . It was so generic. People bought duster because it was sub 4m which we Indians never heard of. I got to know Citroen entry model's front bumper took a new mold just because design wasn't right fitting questioning your build quality.\n\nAlmost all the new Automotive foreign brands taste the waters in India and later exit. Chevrolet, Fiat, Ford, Datsun and now MG motors.\n\nWhat's the USP in your base model? Renault kwid was entry hatchback which had Pesudo SUV look and there were so many features in that launch ad with ARR and so many indigenous artists. Right now, Citroen C3 looks identical to Tata punch giving more sales to them like a decoy effect.\n\n*List goes longer and will add later.\n\n### Comment ID jlx7j24 with +12 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/13tu9fs/thoughts_on_citroën_in_india_and_what_can_they_do/jlx7j24/) (in reply to ID jlx4nr0):\nIn all our communication, and every journalist review as well, Citroën has been synonymous to comfort.\nAnd we've attempted to do that with every piece of communication, be it an ad or a social media post.\nDo you believe there has been a shortcoming of communication, and would you probably want to see something else?\n\nHaving driven both, the C3 and the Punch, unbiased, the C3 drives much better.

Comfort is not the major prospect to see for budget targeted segment like C3.\n\nFor people to get behind the wheel in the showroom is to make something extra, USP. Renault Triber had that unique selling point - budget MPV, sub 4m, seats can be configured like anything according to requirement. ( Why I'm comparing with Renault is that these guys are French guys who understood our Indian audiences and reached well)\n\nIn short, C3 needs to stand out from the crowd with some USP.\n\n#### Comment ID jlximfx with +5 score by [(Enough_Change_9666, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/13tu9fs/thoughts_on_citroën_in_india_and_what_can_they_do/jlximfx/) (in reply to ID jlx7j24):\nPls stop focussing on mass buyers eg hyundai/kia/ms fanboys.

Comfort comes a bit later. Main thing an Indian sees when buying a car is cost to ROI ratio. How much are they getting per lakh spent. A brand like Kia has penetrated the tier 2 and tier 3 city as well. Why? The same ratio mentioned above. In order to win India, you have to penetrate these tier 2 and 3 cities. \n\nCitreon is a foreign brand. It will take time for people to trust the brand. It all depends on the marketing and more importantly the products. My and my team had a look at your YouTube and Instagram page and came to a conclusion that Citroen India is doing nothing different when it comes to advertising and marketing content than any other car brand. If you want to win in India, here are a few things that can help you with marketing and advertising...\n\n* Build a community.  \nSomething similar to what OnePlus did during its inception. Or what Ultraviolette is doing now. As per your current brand image, your target demographics is new-generation India living in metropolitan cities. People between the age of 25-45. Atleast that's what it looks like from your TV and digital content. If you want to spend little money, this is the way to go. Build a community of loyal owners and talk to them about their experiences. Not only that but also feature them in your content (I did see some client testimonials on YouTube) Understand what they like and more importantly what they dont like and what improvement would they like to see in the next generation models. This will help in a couple of ways, when viewers see non-advertising faces on the screen, they understand that the brand is actually listening to the owners and proactively working on delivering the best products. Make Citroen feel like a customer friendly company. this might also help with after-sales service image that many brands are infamous for (looking at you Tata).\n* Change your overall brand image slightly to cater to a wider audience.  \nHaving young faces in your ad looks cool but is nothing different than what other brand ads looks like. Nobody looks at the space in the car and say, 'Happy place' (like in one of your ads) It's cringe after a point. Let's be more realistic and ad real life scenarios without being so tacky and flashy with all sorts of colours. Think about why would a random 45-ish uncle from a village of Gujarat or down south would buy a Citroen. Cater to them as well! Practical scenarios. Create a campaign umbrella under which all the USP's of a product are covered through various real-life situations. Keep it simple.\n* Go over and above a car.  \nThis is about your digital content. Talk about things like road-safety, basic etiquettes like land discipline, using low beam at night etc. Use memes. They are so relatable to your regular audience! Dude, why is your Instagram grid so scattered?! There is no dominant colour throughout the grid. Photos are so random with heavy text on them. There is no brand language that I could recognize. Honestly, it's hap-hazard. Let's start with that first. Make it streamline and organized. Next, look at international counterparts like Lucid or Polestar. Create content that shows the people behind the brand like its engineers, designers and CEO's. Know what the thought process was behind a particular product. When viewers see the people behind the brand talking passionately about their products and the thought process behind them, it makes them trust the brand more.  \nReference: [https://youtu.be/-iU1af5heTc](https://youtu.be/-iU1af5heTc)  \n[https://youtu.be/3wkYSPtoN5E](https://youtu.be/3wkYSPtoN5E)  \nThere is so much you can do on digital than you cant do on TV.  Any piece of content that gets uploaded, be it a photo or video needs to be meaningful. Right from product launches to feature list, thoughts behind the products, talking to executives, tour of the facility, customer testimonials etc. Hell, you can even start a weekly podcast with your India CEO, Design head etc. talking about various thing that a car goes through. Right from an idea to its production version.\n\nThis is what comes to my mind by only going through your social media. Do remember, marketing and advertising can only do so much if the products aren't great. Metaverse is a good example.  \n\n\nLet me know if this helps!\n\n## Comment ID jlxh5pl with +10 score by [(CM_gogo, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/13tu9fs/thoughts_on_citroën_in_india_and_what_can_they_do/jlxh5pl/) (in reply to ID 13tu9fs):\n> \"Biggest challenge we're facing is people not buying the car\"\n\nThis honestly feels like such an amateurish statement. This is the end result and not the core flaw in my opinion as an outsider. The basic marketing funnel goes awareness > interest > consideration > intent > evaluation > purchase. Are you seriously telling me that only the last step is the problem and not any of the earlier ones?\n\nI have so many friends making a car purchase who're not aware even of Citroen or have just heard it in passing and aren't seriously considering it.\n\nFrom what I can see, Citroen tried launching the C5 as a premium model to establish an aspirational brand and failed (just like Fluence, X-Trail, Teana, Rexton, and others) and decided to all of a sudden pivot to the other end of the market with a super-affordable hatchback. Such a product needs volumes which you don't have the dealerships and service network to support. This is also confusing for a consumer as to what does this brand specialise in. The launch of the C3 too was very lacklustre with loads of missing features. A new variant is launched recently but you've missed the bus. Should've come out all guns blazing.\n\nTake the example of Kia which launched a product at the right price point (not too expensive like C5 or too cheap like the C3), equipped it to the gills, added multiple engine + gearbox + fuel + variant options (to the point that it became a bit too much) and marketed it with one of the leading Bollywood celebs.\n\n## Comment ID jlx6vbo with +10 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/13tu9fs/thoughts_on_citroën_in_india_and_what_can_they_do/jlx6vbo/) (in reply to ID 13tu9fs):\nMore showrooms and service centres, better customer reach-out with more cars and better advertisement, improving amenities provided in cars and targeting right segments C5 Aircross is not the product that will make majority of sales.

Brand awareness. (a) assure the masses you are here to stay, the best way to do so is not marketing but investment. And then publicize those investments. (b) Use the reliability of an individual by hiring him as your brand ambassador. (c) Hiring, nothing says commitment by a company when they invest in Human Resources, more jobs will associate more people with the brand, it is along term game.\n\n2. Products need to be differentiated, invest in cosmetics, use the underlying platform for all, but things people see and interact with, needs to be differentiated. Don't be like TATA, Maruti.\n\n3. Awareness about the brand and it's heritage. This is the third attempt by the brand to enter Indian market. Many of us remember the cars and the troubles. Need to ensure you are not just testing waters but playing the long term game.

So watch MS car advertisements, produce competing cars at every price segment and have wider service, dealer network. Your cars will sell like hotcakes. Make no nonsense cars if you are aiming to sell more. India is hard country to sell enthusiast level cars.\n\n## Comment ID jlzd9hi with +1 score by [(DFM__, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/13tu9fs/thoughts_on_citroën_in_india_and_what_can_they_do/jlzd9hi/) (in reply to ID 13tu9fs):\nPrice, features, music system\n\nPrice has to be competitive but also should not miss on features. Current Indian market loves compact SUVs so make one, load with features, a Bose music system.\nAdd sunroof, cool dashboard, strong looking car with a good price tag. People love it when other people look at their cars and it stands out. Also a wide service network, I have a maruti suzuki and a Honda Activa just because I can service it close and won't have to travel long distance just for servicing or minor repairs.\n\nKia got it right and I see them a lot even here in 3rd tier city. You need to get that right. Talk to people and understand what they want, this is a must. People should think that they can get same features for less price in your car or better/more features for same price when compared to other cars.\n\n## Comment ID jlzf73v with +1 score by [(hitohitonomiharshal, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/13tu9fs/thoughts_on_citroën_in_india_and_what_can_they_do/jlzf73v/) (in reply to ID 13tu9fs):\nHave a Alto, Tiago like ENTRY first.\n\n## Comment ID jm01a10 with +1 score by [(ESHAEAN, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/13tu9fs/thoughts_on_citroën_in_india_and_what_can_they_do/jm01a10/) (in reply to ID 13tu9fs):\nPricing of your cars should be more in sync with the features offered tbh.\n\n## Comment ID jm0ku1x with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/13tu9fs/thoughts_on_citroën_in_india_and_what_can_they_do/jm0ku1x/) (in reply to ID 13tu9fs):\nAs someone looking for a car right now, I got to know of your brand the last. \n\nThat probably affects decision making, doesn't it? \n\nAlso, my first choice is a sedan, but willing to settle for a SUV.

There is no brand identity or recognition associated with  Citroën in india. You should advertise the heritage of the brand more. \n\nVAG boys rave about the driving experience/build quality /safety of their unreliable and expensive cars. \n\nToyota fans endorse their brand for reliability despite it being boring and overpriced. \n\nMaruti lovers love the fuel economy, reliability and service network of their 2 star rated tins. Hyundai is similar but they look decent and have a lot of features. \n\nMahindra and Tata fanbase overlook reliability and support their brands for their safety and looks mostly. \n\nHonda has VTEC lovers on their team, despite ageing product line. \n\n2. Put your self in the shoes of a Citroën ‘fanboy’. \nOn what grounds would you defend/endorse this brand on an internet forum? Why is it desirable?\n\n## Comment ID jm12jo5 with +1 score by [(Salty_Introduction31, Reddit, 2023-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/13tu9fs/thoughts_on_citroën_in_india_and_what_can_they_do/jm12jo5/) (in reply to ID 13tu9fs):\nHaving a plant in Hosur .

Pitching comfort isn't enough. Unlike in Europe, almost every present automaker here already strongly emphasizes the comfort aspect. Performance is secondary here. Look how Kia established itself. People found the striking exterior and high-tech interior and ignored the safety aspect, even the fuel economy factor.\n\nCan I just say that the decision to bring Citroen to India was a poor move from Stellantis? The quirky design language is an immediate turn-off. And it'll probably never change, which is understandable as that'd mean losing brand identity.\n\nWish we had Peugeot. Would've been a runaway hit! People respond to power and road presence, especially in the ₹10 lakh+ segments. Yes, Peugeot has had a bad history in India. But the new generation of young customers is willing to move on and give it a chance.\n\n## Comment ID jm1q2wt with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/13tu9fs/thoughts_on_citroën_in_india_and_what_can_they_do/jm1q2wt/) (in reply to ID 13tu9fs):\nCitroen comes at a focal change point in india where consumer demands have suddenly changed.\n\nIn 2015, manual hatchback with turbo engine was a good way to start. In 2022, it was not.\n\nCitroen also has misread Indian market terribly. Launching ec3 with underpowered motor at a 10 lakh price shows they are not getting it. \n\nIf they wanna improve then things they got to do\n\n1. Introduce their hybrid c5 at premium segment and discontinue the diesel\n2. Introduce a competitive ev at Creta segment cause their aircross suv on its own won't work\n3. Introduce their very capable c4 in india at 25 lakh price range \n4. Introduce variants fulfilling some basic features like ADAS, Automatic gearshift, Rear Viper, etc. \n5.

No alloy wheels, no climate control, no big infotainment ,no LED lamps and critically no Automatic are big misses compared to the competiton. While the dynamics and comfort are really class-leading, we indians love our features, so having some will definitely increase your value proposition. As an enthusiast myself, I'd take good dynamics and good powertrain over other options, but I'm in the minority compared to most of the people shopping in this segment.\n\nFeatures are the biggest draw, but please don't sacrifice on other components to bring this is all we ask. Also, having just manual is no good these days, cities are moving to automatics and that's where most of Citroen's presence is. \n\nCitroen also needs to step up it's advertising, as not many people are cognizant of your existence.\n\n## Comment ID js19pm8 with +1 score by [(snoopyndrest, Reddit, 2023-07-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/13tu9fs/thoughts_on_citroën_in_india_and_what_can_they_do/js19pm8/) (in reply to ID 13tu9fs):\nThis is my take on the C3. \nThe turbo variant has a better engine than its competitors, its comfortable - seats and suspension both. \nActually its naturally aspirated engine is also very good. What I mean by good is that its a really peppy car. Its so responsive, it just takes off. You don’t get performance like that at this price point. \nIts not claustrophobic inside either, like how the baleno and other cars of this dimension are. \nIts build quality is also pretty good, it feels solid.\nThe looks of the C3 are aesthetically pleasing, so thats always nice.\nIt has good ground clearance. Again better than its rivals. Its gives peace of mind on broken uneven roads.\nThe tyres on this car, in the shine turbo variant, are broader than that of its competitors. It makes it stable on the highway at high speeds. Also because its slightly broad and less in overall height - it adds to its stability. \n\nYou should make a video of this car being driven around in the hills, because its engine is powerful enough to drive on steep climbs, like in Missouri, or Manali, especially during traffic. Show how great its clutch, hand break, and climbing ability is on an uphill climb during a traffic jam. \nAlso its great on bad roads, you don’t really feel the bumps at all. \nAnd its so stable on the highway at high speeds. The really nice thing about this car is that its just a pleasure to drive. \nAnd that is its selling point. Its a drivers car. \nIts ergonomic, so its comfortable, its fun.\nYou can drive hours and not get a back ache or a neck ache.\n\nThe C3 is also more mechanical a car than electronic. \nI drove a mahindra xuv 300 in the hills one time, and in traffic because of a clutch misfire it switched off, and the steering got locked and the breaks wouldn’t work and I was on an incline and that was very scary because I could have just hit the car in front because it started to slip forward. I managed to restart the car fast enough but this is a huge problem in cars now days because they are more electric than mechanic and if they switch off everything gets locked and restarting the car is a while process.\nIn older cars you never faced such an issue, so that just made them safer. \n\nHaving less electronic parts also is more affordable to maintain in the long run. Its real competitors are wagon r and i10. \nIn features, which everyone loves, it is lacking. The price its being sold at is not at par with the features offered. That is the main reason no is going for this car. \nSo the only thing to do is highlight its standout features, which I have listed on top. No other car in this category and one above it has a peppy engine like the C3 has. \nIt needs heavy advertising, because no one will know otherwise. Also the servicing needs to highlighted. The lack of service centres is a drawback.\n\nSo yeah, get it reviewed more by some popular car youtubers.\nSecondly, make some great adverts like a road trip from delhi to manali, show it being driven around and highlight its good points. Because where its good, its really good."

          "cons": "Magnite pay is well below industry standard. I was told by HR when leaving the company that Magnite does not want to be known as a top paying company. This leads mid/junior employees to have higher turnover rates than expected.\n\nA lot of teams are very top-heavy, which leaves no room or possibility for others to get promoted. I was at Magnite for over 5 years, and we never once did a proper year end, employee evaluation. At other companies, you typically do your evaluation with your manager in December, who then provides feedback on how to grow in your career. Where you stand in terms of performance should not be a surprise, but at Magnite it is. When January comes around, random people get promoted, and your manager will just look at you shrug and say there wasn't enough budget for anyone else to get promoted. Given promotions only happen once a year, this is an extremely upsetting situation to be in, and is the exact reason why many people leave the company. \n\nEach team's RTO is different. Understandably, RTO is the new normal, but then everyone should be held to the same standard. There are engineers that need to be in the office 3x a week, but then several SALES people are allowed to work completely remote? People who lead large teams are completely remote? The company needs a more fair stance. It seems only senior level people at the company got permission to be remote, while everyone else is held to a different standard.",

C-level management was either incompetent or so out of touch they end up being incompetent, I couldn't tell. Middle management is a bunch of yes-men (men, no women) who aggressively play the \"just go with it even though it's a bad plan, it will get fixed eventually\" card and as far as I can tell they are all highly loaded with stock and just playing a waiting game to dump it all as soon as it vests.. I can't blame them there. Day to day is a slew of overstaffed meetings that should have been (or already were) tracked issues and don't really accomplish anything with some spurts of work thrown in. At SpotX I would be able to get about 20-25 hours per 40hr week of active work completed and Magnite I was peaking in the mid to low teens. It seems from my view that every piece of infrastructure is set up by only skimming documentation and then getting it to a place at which it just barely functions then moving on and never ever coming back to get it out of alpha stage. Bugs become features, duct tape becomes structural and all that. Honestly I have never seen a more toxic work environment. The back to office mandate that all but management follows was a cherry. I loved spotx because of the teams and attitude of all trying to push in the same direction and we all tried that at magnite when we got acquired.. and got promptly thrown under every bus they could find. I'm glad I got a package, others were not so lucky. Beware of the politics in middle management, some of them can lie very well, and pay attention to who is the one pulling their strings. Check the companies cycle of funding, quarterly reports and then immediate stock dumps by all employees.",

        "cons": "I was only at Magnite for 2 years and was actually hired by the acquired SpotX 8 years prior to that so I'm sure my situation was not exactly shared by everyone. C-level management was either incompetent or so out of touch they end up being incompetent, I couldn't tell. Middle management is a bunch of yes-men (men, no women) who aggressively play the \"just go with it even though it's a bad plan, it will get fixed eventually\" card and as far as I can tell they are all highly loaded with stock and just playing a waiting game to dump it all as soon as it vests.. I can't blame them there. Day to day is a slew of overstaffed meetings that should have been (or already were) tracked issues and don't really accomplish anything with some spurts of work thrown in. At SpotX I would be able to get about 20-25 hours per 40hr week of active work completed and Magnite I was peaking in the mid to low teens. It seems from my view that every piece of infrastructure is set up by only skimming documentation and then getting it to a place at which it just barely functions then moving on and never ever coming back to get it out of alpha stage. Bugs become features, duct tape becomes structural and all that. Honestly I have never seen a more toxic work environment. The back to office mandate that all but management follows was a cherry. I loved spotx because of the teams and attitude of all trying to push in the same direction and we all tried that at magnite when we got acquired.. and got promptly thrown under every bus they could find. I'm glad I got a package, others were not so lucky. Beware of the politics in middle management, some of them can lie very well, and pay attention to who is the one pulling their strings. Check the companies cycle of funding, quarterly reports and then immediate stock dumps by all employees.",

This leads mid/junior employees to have higher turnover rates than expected.\n\nA lot of teams are very top-heavy, which leaves no room or possibility for others to get promoted. I was at Magnite for over 5 years, and we never once did a proper year end, employee evaluation. At other companies, you typically do your evaluation with your manager in December, who then provides feedback on how to grow in your career. Where you stand in terms of performance should not be a surprise, but at Magnite it is. When January comes around, random people get promoted, and your manager will just look at you shrug and say there wasn't enough budget for anyone else to get promoted. Given promotions only happen once a year, this is an extremely upsetting situation to be in, and is the exact reason why many people leave the company. \n\nEach team's RTO is different. Understandably, RTO is the new normal, but then everyone should be held to the same standard. There are engineers that need to be in the office 3x a week, but then several SALES people are allowed to work completely remote? People who lead large teams are completely remote? The company needs a more fair stance. It seems only senior level people at the company got permission to be remote, while everyone else is held to a different standard.",

It worked better than I thought it would. But like most other corporations, stop with the drum beating and emptiness of setting goals as if we are cattle to be herded and prodded. Goal-setting itself isn't the problem -- the way it is forced and meaningless is. You want employees that *want* on their own to make the company better ... right? At least one of the subsidiaries you acquired had a better way of achieving this than you do. And this isn't nostalgia or hurt due to change.

      "# [2024 Nissan Magnite compact SUV launched in India with upgraded interior: Check price, features and more by Livemint on 2024-10-04](https://www.livemint.com/auto-news/2024-nissan-magnite-launched-in-india-with-upgraded-interior-check-price-features-and-more-11728034963159.html)\nNissan has introduced the 2024 facelift of its popular compact SUV, the Magnite, in India, with prices starting at ₹5.99 lakh (ex-showroom). Notably, this price remains unchanged from the previous model. With the latest update, Nissan has also refreshed the variant lineup, renaming the trims as Visia, Visia+, Acenta, NConnecta, Tekna, and Tekna+.\n\n2024 Nissan Magnite: Powertrain Options\n\nUnder the bonnet, the 2024 Magnite remains mechanically identical to the outgoing model, offering two petrol engine options. Buyers can choose between a 1.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine and a 1.0-litre naturally aspirated petrol engine. The turbocharged engine produces 98 bhp and 160 Nm of torque, available with either a five-speed manual transmission or a CVT gearbox. The naturally aspirated unit, on the other hand, delivers 71 bhp and 96 Nm of torque, paired with a five-speed manual or an Automated Manual Transmission (AMT).\n\n2024 Nissan Magnite: Exterior Design Changes\n\nWhile the overall silhouette of the Magnite remains unchanged, the 2024 model features subtle design updates. The front fascia has been enhanced with a redesigned bumper and a more prominent grille, giving the vehicle a sportier and more assertive look. The signature boomerang-shaped daytime running lights (DRLs) are positioned on the lower bumper, and the new bi-functional LED projector headlights are now automatic.\n\nFrom the side, the Magnite retains its familiar look but now comes equipped with redesigned 16-inch alloy wheels. At the rear, the facelift includes reworked tail lamps with a distinctive smoked finish and fresh detailing, alongside a tweaked bumper design.\n\n2024 Nissan Magnite: Interior Upgrades\n\nInside, the changes are similarly cosmetic rather than a complete overhaul. The cabin layout is familiar, but the upholstery has been upgraded to an all-leather finish, adding a touch of luxury. Other enhancements include a frameless auto-dimming interior rear-view mirror (IRVM) and a wireless charging pad. A new interior colour scheme, dubbed Sunshine Orange, adds a vibrant option to the lineup.\n\nThe 2024 Magnite retains its seven-inch digital instrument cluster, now featuring customisable graphics, and continues to offer wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity, complemented by an Arkamys 3D sound system. Notably, the new model also adds a single-pane electric sunroof.\n\n2024 Nissan Magnite: Enhanced Safety Features\n\nOn the safety front, Nissan has upgraded the Magnite with six airbags, Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC), Electronic Stability Control (ESC), and Hill Start Assist. Additionally, the SUV now includes a Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS), ISOFIX mounts for child seats, and an emergency stop signal. ABS with EBD, traction control, and hydraulic brake assist remain standard.",

Let us take a look at what the images suggest.\n\nWhat Was Spotted?\n\nThe fresh set of leaked images show the updated headlights and the boomerang-shaped DRLs in the facelifted model which seem to have been carried over from the pre-facelift Magnite. The grille is still hexagonal but has revised elements in it. While there is a new gloss black surround around the grille, there are two chunky boomerang-shaped chrome elements on the sides, which is similar to the current-spec Magnite. The facelifted model will also come with an aggressively-designed front skid plate.\n\nThe rear profile of the 2024 Nissan Magnite looks almost identical to that of the outgoing model. What is different is that the tail lights of the 2024 Magnite have been redesigned and feature a blacked-out effect.

It can also come with a bigger digital driver’s display, a single-pane sunroof and six airbags. The safety suite can continue with a 360-degree camera and a tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS).\n\n2024 Nissan Magnite: Powertrain Options\n\nThe same powertrain options are expected to be carried over from the pre-facelift model.

It will also lock horns with sub-4m crossovers like the Maruti Fronx and Toyota Urban Cruiser Taisor.\n\nSource\n\nFollow the CarDekho WhatsApp channel to get instant updates from the automotive world.",

      "# [New Nissan Magnite compact SUV unveiled in India on 2024-10-04](https://global.nissannews.com/en/releases/new-nissan-magnite-compact-suv-unveiled-in-india)\nYOKOHAMA, Japan – Nissan today unveiled the new Magnite compact SUV in India, where it will be manufactured and sold. The new model combines sleek new styling, innovative technologies, optimum efficiency, and reinforced safety features.\n\nThe introduction of new Magnite across Africa, Middle East, and India comes as part of a broad product offensive and Nissan’s move to position India as a manufacturing hub under the Arc, Nissan’s mid-term business plan.\n\nNissan aims to export nearly 100,000 units to more than 65 markets in total by 2026, representing the largest coverage for a vehicle produced in Nissan’s Africa, Middle East, India and Oceania region.\n\nBold styling & advanced tech\n\nThe Magnite is a striking compact SUV, with robust exterior styling complemented by LED lights front and rear, alloy wheels and roof rails.\n\nInside, the new Magnite adds a configurable TFT driver display, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, for seamless smartphone integration, as well as a wireless smartphone charger.

      "# [Magnite Tackles Fully Automated Prebid Wrapper Optimization by Anthony Vargas on 2024-08-01](https://www.adexchanger.com/publishers/magnite-tackles-fully-automated-prebid-wrapper-optimization/)\nWhen it comes to programmatic advertising, milliseconds matter.\n\nTo maximize revenue, publishers have to configure their Prebid setups to account for how quickly SSP auctions can respond to bid requests. Response times can vary based on factors like site visitors’ geographic region, what devices they’re using or whether the SSP has a server-side or client-side integration with the publisher.\n\nTypically, publishers have to make such adjustments to their Prebid wrappers manually. But automation is taking some of the pressure off.\n\nRanker, a website specializing in ranked lists voted on by its users, has been testing Prebid optimization for the past year via Demand Manager, a solution provided by its preferred SSP partner, Magnite. Demand Manager recently added a Prebid automation feature that is now available for broad adoption, Magnite announced today.\n\nPreviously, Ranker used Demand Manager for A/B testing different manual Prebid setups. But in April, Ranker began experimenting with the new feature, which fully automates Prebid wrapper optimization at the bid request level in real time. Between April and July, this automation produced a 5% increase in ad spend from Ranker’s demand partners, compared to a control group of unoptimized impressions, said Alex Mason, VP of programmatic sales, yield and strategy at Ranker.\n\nSolving the optimization problem\n\n“Prebid setup effectively is a massive optimization problem,” said Sunil Gupta, VP of product management at Magnite.\n\nConsider the task of manually setting Prebid auction timeouts: Setting timeouts too low can cause a publisher to miss out on winning bids from SSPs that take longer to respond. But setting timeouts too high can increase the chance the ad won’t render properly, which also has a detrimental effect on revenue.\n\nPublishers can make manual adjustments, but they can’t really account for the sheer variety of factors that can impact how quickly SSPs can respond to bid requests, such as how far certain geos are from data centers and whether the SSP prioritizes the type of ad inventory on auction, Gupta said.\n\nIn contrast, Demand Manager’s new automated optimization feature can tailor auction timeouts to the individual bid request at the moment the impression is served, Gupta said. Plus, it can make those adjustments outside of normal work hours.\n\nThe solution bases its optimization on past ad auctions run by the publisher and how well SSPs performed under different auction criteria. The solution silos this data on a per-publisher basis; optimizations that worked for other publishers do not inform how Ranker optimizes.\n\nThe potential impact of this automation on Ranker’s ad business could be substantial – the publisher currently earns about 50% of its digital ad revenue from Prebid, across both open exchange and private marketplace (PMP) deals, Mason said.\n\nRanker began testing Demand Manager’s new automation capabilities on a subset of its international traffic back in April. But after seeing positive results, Ranker has since expanded the tool across its entire Prebid display business, Mason added.\n\nFreeing up resources\n\n“Before Demand Manager, Ranker had its own in-house version of Prebid, which is great if you have a large team of developers that are only focusing on Prebid,” he said.\n\nBut with the web dev team spread across site development and Prebid, making small changes was a headache.\n\n“It was like pulling teeth if we wanted to add a new bidder, remove a bidder [or adjust] timeouts,” Mason said. “Having to tell a dev team that you want to increase timeouts – I don’t wish that on my enemies.”\n\nInstead, Ranker can now hand off Prebid optimization to Magnite, whose business is based on understanding the nuances of how Prebid setups affect auction dynamics, he said. Ranker’s web dev team can instead focus on webpage layouts and site updates, while its ad ops team can focus on optimizing direct campaigns, which bring in higher CPMs than programmatic.\n\nWhich SSP and when\n\nThe automation is also helping Ranker wrap its head around which SSPs are worth doing business with and which bid requests to send to which SSPs under which circumstances.\n\nRanker typically has between 10 and 12 active SSPs at a given time, Mason said. Some SSPs respond better to auctions based in certain regions, and some are only worth pinging for specific types of inventory. Demand Manager automatically surfaces those insights and adjusts which SSPs receive the bid requests accordingly.\n\nFor example, Magnite is Ranker’s primary demand partner for PMP deals. So, during times when Ranker has a lot of active PMPs in effect, Demand Manager can set Magnite as a high-priority bidder and give it first crack at PMP auctions, Mason said.\n\nRanker also works with Flipp, which serves native retail media placements through Prebid, but only on certain pages and under specific circumstances. Those Flipp ads monetize very well compared to other placements, so Ranker wants to prioritize serving them when it can, Mason said. Demand Manager can recognize when a Flipp ad is likely to win an auction and adjust the bid wrapper in real time to facilitate that, while avoiding sending bid requests Flipp won’t be interested in.\n\nGoing forward, Magnite anticipates updating Demand Manager to weigh the impact different alternative IDs have on demand, Gupta said.\n\nSuch a feature would be instrumental in helping publishers decide which ID partners and SSPs to work with, Mason said.\n\nMason has already used Demand Manager’s findings to cut SSPs from Ranker’s Prebid stack. And he’s also used it to test new demand partners before fully integrating them. Previously, Mason would evaluate demand partners across a quarter or multiple quarters.\n\n“It helps us prioritize our partners that are consistently performing, pick out the ones that are consistently underperforming, and makes that decisioning easier,” he said. “It gives me the ability to give newer partners a chance, rather than having this drawn-out process of evaluating them.”",

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as \"may,\" \"might,\" \"will,\" \"objective,\" \"intend,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"can,\" \"would,\" \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"design,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" \"plan\" or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the Company’s guidance or expectations with respect to future financial performance; acquisitions by the Company, or the anticipated benefits thereof; potential synergies from the Company's acquisitions; macroeconomic conditions or concerns related thereto; the growth of ad-supported programmatic connected television (\"CTV\"); our ability to use and collect data to provide our offerings; scope and duration of client relationships; the fees we may charge in the future; our anticipated financial performance; key strategic objectives; anticipated benefits of new offerings; business mix; sales growth; benefits from supply path optimization; the development of identity solutions; client utilization of our offerings; our competitive differentiation; our market share and leadership position in the industry; market conditions, trends, and opportunities; certain statements regarding future operational performance measures; and other statements that are not historical facts.

These forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of the report in which they are included. Unless required by federal securities laws, we assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated, to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the statements are made. Without limiting the foregoing, any guidance we may provide will generally be given only in connection with quarterly and annual earnings announcements, without interim updates, and we may appear at industry conferences or make other public statements without disclosing material nonpublic information in our possession. Given these uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Investors should read this press release and the documents that we reference in this press release and have filed or will file with the SEC completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Operational Measures:\n\nIn addition to our GAAP results, we review certain non-GAAP financial measures to help us evaluate our business on a consistent basis, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of investments in our technology and development and sales and marketing, and assess our operational efficiencies. These non-GAAP measures include Contribution ex-TAC, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Income (Loss), and Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) per share, each of which is discussed below.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, or as superior to, the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments, and review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP measures, and the reasons we consider them appropriate. It is important to note that the particular items we exclude from, or include in, our non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the items excluded from, or included in, similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. See \"Reconciliation of Revenue to Gross Profit to Contribution ex-TAC,\" \"Reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA,\" \"Reconciliation of net loss to non-GAAP income,\" and \"Reconciliation of GAAP loss per share to non-GAAP earnings per share\" included as part of this press release.\n\nWe do not provide a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial expectations for Contribution ex-TAC and Adjusted EBITDA, or a forecast of the most comparable GAAP measures, because the amount and timing of many future charges that impact these measures (such as amortization of future acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related charges, foreign exchange (gain) loss, net, stock-based compensation, impairment charges, provision or benefit for income taxes, and our future revenue mix), which could be material, are variable, uncertain, or out of our control and therefore cannot be reasonably predicted without unreasonable effort, if at all. In addition, we believe such reconciliations or forecasts could imply a degree of precision that might be confusing or misleading to investors.\n\nContribution ex-TAC:\n\nContribution ex-TAC is calculated as gross profit plus cost of revenue, excluding traffic acquisition cost (\"TAC\"). Traffic acquisition cost, a component of cost of revenue, represents what we must pay sellers for the sale of advertising inventory through our platform for revenue reported on a gross basis. Contribution ex-TAC is a non-GAAP financial measure that is most comparable to gross profit. We believe Contribution ex-TAC is a useful measure in assessing the performance of Magnite and facilitates a consistent comparison against our core business without considering the impact of traffic acquisition costs related to revenue reported on a gross basis.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA:\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment charges, interest income or expense, and other cash and non-cash based income or expenses that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance, including, but not limited to foreign exchange gains and losses, acquisition and related items, gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, other debt refinancing expenses, non-operational real estate and other expenses (income), net, and provision (benefit) for income taxes. We also track future expenses on an Adjusted EBITDA basis, and describe them as Adjusted EBITDA operating expenses, which includes total operating expenses. Total operating expenses include cost of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA operating expenses is calculated as Contribution ex-TAC less Adjusted EBITDA. We adjust Adjusted EBITDA operating expenses for the same expense items excluded in Adjusted EBITDA. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our performance for the following reasons:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company’s performance without regard to items such as those we exclude in calculating this measure, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired.\n\nOur management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies, and in communications with our board of directors concerning our performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also used as a metric for determining payment of cash incentive compensation.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA provides a measure of consistency and comparability with our past performance that many investors find useful, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, and also facilitates comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\n\nAlthough Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. These limitations include:\n\nStock-based compensation is a non-cash charge and will remain an element of our long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period.\n\nDepreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, and the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, but Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements.\n\nImpairment charges are non-cash charges related to goodwill, intangible assets and/or long-lived assets.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisition and related items, such as amortization of acquired intangible assets, merger, acquisition, or restructuring related severance costs, and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash and non-cash charges and changes in, or cash requirements for, acquisition and related items, such as certain transaction expenses.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash and non-cash charges related to certain financing transactions such as gains or losses on extinguishment of debt or other debt refinancing expenses.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in our working capital needs, capital expenditures, non-operational real estate expenses or income, or contractual commitments.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for income taxes and the cash impact of other income or expense.\n\nOther companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\nOur Adjusted EBITDA is influenced by fluctuations in our revenue, cost of revenue, and the timing and amounts of the cost of our operations. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nNon-GAAP Income (Loss) and Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) per Share:\n\nWe define non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share as non-GAAP income (loss) divided by non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding. Non-GAAP income (loss) is equal to net income (loss) excluding stock-based compensation, cash and non-cash based merger, acquisition, and restructuring costs, which consist primarily of professional service fees associated with merger and acquisition activities, cash-based employee termination costs, and other restructuring activities, including facility closures, relocation costs, contract termination costs, and impairment costs of abandoned technology associated with restructuring activities, amortization of acquired intangible assets, gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, non-operational real estate and other expenses or income, foreign currency gains and losses, interest expense associated with Convertible Senior Notes, other debt refinance expenses, and the tax impact of these items. In periods in which we have non-GAAP income, non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding used to calculate non-GAAP earnings per share includes the impact of potentially dilutive shares. Potentially dilutive shares consist of stock options, restricted stock units, performance stock units, and potential shares issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, each computed using the treasury stock method, and the impact of shares that would be issuable assuming conversion of all of the Convertible Senior Notes, calculated under the if-converted method. We believe non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance and our trends on a per share basis, and also facilitates comparison of our financial results on a per share basis with other companies, many of which present a similar non-GAAP measure. However, a potential limitation of our use of non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share is that other companies may define non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share differently, which may make comparison difficult. This measure may also exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. Non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share is a performance measure and should not be used as a measure of liquidity. Because of these limitations, we also consider the comparable GAAP measure of net income (loss).\n\nInvestor Relations Contact\n\nNick Kormeluk\n\n(949) 500-0003\n\nnkormeluk@magnite.com\n\nMedia

      "# [2024 Nissan Magnite Facelift Photos Leak – Front, Rear, Interiors by Akshay Kulkarni on 2024-10-02](https://www.rushlane.com/nissan-magnite-facelift-design-leaked-ahead-of-launch-12507855.html)\nSoon to launch Nissan Magnite facelift will rival Tata Nexon, Maruti Brezza, Mahindra XUV3XO, Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet and Renault Kiger\n\nAfter launching their X-Trail premium SUV, Nissan is prepping to launch Magnite facelift with meaningful upgrades to refresh it for the festive season. Ahead of the 4th October launch, Nissan Magnite facelift design has been fully revealed from what looks like a dealer yard. Let’s take a look at what’s new.\n\nNissan Magnite Facelift Design\n\nIn a rather interesting turn of events, Nissan Magnite Facelift design has been fully revealed ahead of launch. Units seem to have arrived at showrooms and have been papped before the launch on 4th October. As expected, this is a minor update to Nissan’s take on sub 4m SUV segment.\n\nBeing an affordable offering, Magnite is expected to push more volume than it did with pre-facelift model. As seen in the recent spy shots, we can see the car’s updated design. At the front, we get to see an updated fascia with a redesigned bumper with a larger silver element, mimicking a bull bar.\n\nNissan has added black finish trim around the chrome elements that flanked the grill. From the looks of it, Nissan Magnite seems to have retained its grill size as before but has a new pattern. Headlights look similar to pre-facelift model, which might not be a bad thing as it gets LED projectors with LED turn indicators.\n\nBoomerang-shaped LED DRLs look similar to pre-facelift model as well. At the sides, we get new alloy wheels and that’s about it. At the rear, bumper looks like it is slightly redesigned. However, the main change is LED tail lights with a clear casing. Brake lights seem to be LEDs this time around. This particular unit spied, had a Gold or Brown exterior shade, which could be the launch colour of Magnite facelift. On the inside, we can see Nissan has added a dash of playfulness with Magnite facelift. We can see that with the Orange and Black interior theme.\n\nWhat are the interior updates?\n\nOther than the colour theme, there don’t seem to be any new updates on the inside. At least, that appears to be the case as seen with Nissan’s recent teasers and these new spy shots. We can see a Lamborghini-inspired dashboard layout with three-spoke steering, which now gets black elements for added sportiness.\n\nFeatures like auto climate control, rear AC vents, front and rear armrests, cruise control, push-button start, keyless entry, 7-inch digital instrument cluster, 8-inch infotainment screen with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay will continue as is. We hope Nissan adds auto-dimming IRVM, ventilated seats, auto headlights, rain-sensing wipers, and 360-camera among others.\n\nPowertrains will continue as is. This means, a 1.0L 3-cyl engine offered either in naturally aspirated state or turbocharged state. NA petrol has 71 bhp and 96 Nm and gets either a 5-speed manual or AMT. While turbo petrol engine gets 99 bhp and 160 Nm, mated to either a 5-speed manual or a CVT.",
      "# [MGNI: Is Magnite a Top Pick in Digital Advertising? by StockNews.com Staff on 2024-07-07](https://stocknews.com/news/mgni-nexn-crto-tbla-is-magnite-a-top-pick-in-digital-advertising/)\nThe digital advertising landscape is expanding rapidly as consumers spend more time online. Brands are fiercely competing for attention across websites, social media platforms, and mobile apps. This competition has driven a surge in digital ad spending, with the global market projected to exceed $1.37 trillion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 9.6% from 2024 to 2033.\n\nShould investors seeking a slice of this growing pie consider investing in Magnite, Inc. (MGNI)? Valued at a $1.89 billion market cap, the company operates a prominent independent sell-side advertising platform, connecting publishers with advertisers. It provides access to premium ad spaces across the web, mobile apps, Connected TV (CTV), and audio.\n\nMGNI exceeded Wall Street’s expectations in the first quarter with strong top and bottom-line results. Contribution ex-TAC for CTV significantly surpassed the high end of their guidance range, reaching $130.60 million, up 12% year-over-year. Moreover, their CTV segment saw an 18% year-over-year rise to $54.89 million, while DV+ grew 9% to $75.70 million.\n\nMichael G. Barrett, President and CEO of MGNI, commented, “We finished the quarter with strong CTV upside in live sports, related to March Madness, as well as strong continued growth in ad serving, both contributing to share gains. DV+ also posted strong results with growth of 9%.”\n\n“A positive ad spend environment to start 2024, plus our share gains, have led to a great start to the year, and we remain optimistic this momentum will continue. There is a clear trend to consolidation in our space, and we believe the strongest, technically superior, scaled players that deliver the best monetization, will capture market share gains,” he added.\n\nShares of MGNI have gained 81.1% over the past nine months and 44.9% year-to-date, closing the last trading session at $13.53. However, the stock has dipped marginally over the past month.\n\nLet’s look at factors that could influence MGNI’s performance in the upcoming months.\n\nRecent Strategic Partnership\n\n10 STOCKS TO SELL NOW!\n\nOn June 18, the company announced an expanded partnership with Spectrum Reach, the advertising sales arm of Charter Communications, Inc. This partnership enhances programmatic ad-buying access across Spectrum Reach’s vast library of premium linear and streaming TV inventory.\n\nThe agreement extends MGNI’s full programmatic capabilities to Spectrum’s latest video delivery technology, allowing ad buyers to bid on individual impressions in real time. Additionally, ad buyers will benefit from centralized planning and frequency management across linear and digital platforms.\n\nIn March, MGNI and Mediaocean announced an exclusive partnership to enhance automation and supply path efficiency for connected TV (CTV) and online video (OLV) advertising. This partnership allows Mediaocean’s Prisma buyers to directly activate streaming campaigns with premium video sellers through MGNI’s ClearLine solution. It builds on their 2023 deal, which integrated Magnite’s streaming inventory into Mediaocean’s ad infrastructure for local TV buyers.\n\nMixed Financials\n\nFor the first quarter that ended March 31, 2024, MGNI’s revenue increased 14.7% year-over-year to $149.32 million, beating the analysts’ revenue estimate of $124.16 million. Its adjusted EBITDA rose 7.2% from the year-ago value to $26.03 million. Its non-GAAP net income grew 38.8% from the previous year’s quarter to $7.98 million. Furthermore, the company’s adjusted EPS came in at $0.05, up 25% year-over-year.\n\nHowever, its loss from operations for the quarter was $13.83 million. The company’s cash outflow from operating activities amounted to $60.41 million, up 95.5% from $30.89 million in the year-ago period. Also, as of March 31, 2024, MTDR’s cash and cash equivalents decreased to $252.83 million, compared to $326.22 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\nFavorable Analyst Expectations\n\nAnalysts expect MGNI’s revenue and EPS for the second quarter (ended June 2024) to grow 6.9% and 72.1% year-over-year to $144.10 million and $0.15, respectively. Moreover, the company surpassed consensus EPS and revenue estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, which is remarkable.\n\nFor the fiscal year ending December 2024, Street expects MGNI’s revenue to increase 10.6% from the prior year to $607.77 million. The company is expected to post an earnings per share of $0.82, indicating a 52.3% year-over-year growth.\n\nIn addition, the company’s revenue and EPS for the fiscal year 2025 are expected to increase 10.8% and 13.6% year-over-year to $673.57 million and $0.93, respectively.\n\nMixed Valuation\n\nIn terms of forward non-GAAP PEG, MGNI is trading at 0.44x, 68.3% lower than the industry average of 1.37x.\n\nHowever, the stock’s forward EV/Sales and EV/EBITDA multiples of 3.73 and 11.48 are 98.1% and 50.5% above the respective industry averages of 1.88 and 7.63. Likewise, its forward non-GAAP P/E ratio of 16.45x is 29.9% higher than the industry average of 12.66x.\n\nMixed Profitability\n\nMGNI’s trailing-12-month levered FCF margin of 29.61% is 246.1% higher than the 8.56% industry average. Also, the stock’s trailing-12-month Capex/Sales of 4.42% is 22% higher than the industry average of 3.62%.\n\nHowever, its trailing-12-month EBITDA margin of 11.89% is 36.3% lower than the industry average of 18.65%. MGNI’s trailing-12-month net income margin and ROCE of negative 12.24% and negative 11.17% compares to the respective industry averages of 2.87% and 3.56%.\n\nPOWR Ratings Reflect Uncertainty\n\nMGNI’s mixed fundamentals are reflected in its POWR Ratings. The stock has an overall rating of C, which translates to Neutral in our proprietary rating system. The POWR Ratings are calculated by taking into account 118 different factors, with each factor weighted to an optimal degree.\n\nOur proprietary rating system also evaluates each stock based on eight distinct categories. MGNI has earned a B grade for Sentiment, consistent with optimistic analyst estimates.\n\nHowever, the stock has a C grade for Value and Quality, in sync with its mixed valuation and profit margins. Also, MGNI has a D grade for Stability, justified by its five-year beta of 2.34.\n\nWithin the B-rated Advertising industry, MGNI is ranked #8 out of 16 stocks.\n\nBeyond what I have stated above, we have also given MGNI grades for Growth and Momentum. Get all MGNI ratings here.\n\nBottom Line\n\nMGNI showed resilience in the first quarter of 2024, surpassing revenue expectations and demonstrating growth in adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income. This performance underscores its solid position in the digital advertising space, especially with its strategic partnerships aimed at enhancing programmatic ad-buying efficiency.\n\nHowever, the company reported a loss from operations and a substantial increase in cash outflow from operating activities compared to the previous year, reflecting challenges in managing costs and cash flow.\n\nWhile Magnite’s initiatives to enhance programmatic ad-buying capabilities and expand into connected TV are promising, the stock’s high volatility and current valuation suggest caution for potential investors. Given these mixed signals, waiting for a better entry point in this stock seems prudent.\n\nHow Does Magnite, Inc. (MGNI) Stack Up Against Its Peers?\n\nWhile MGNI has an overall grade of C, equating to a Neutral rating, you may check out these A (Strong Buy) rated stocks within the Advertising industry: Nexxen International Ltd. (NEXN), Criteo S.A. (CRTO), and Taboola.com Ltd. (TBLA).\n\nTo explore more A and B-rated advertising stocks, click here.\n\nWhat To Do Next?\n\n43 year investment veteran, Steve Reitmeister, has just released his 2024 market outlook along with trading plan and top 11 picks for the year ahead.\n\n2024 Stock Market Outlook >\n\nMGNI shares closed at $13.53 on Friday, down $-0.09 (-0.66%). Year-to-date, MGNI has gained 44.86%, versus a 17.43% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.\n\nAbout the Author: Shweta Kumari\n\nShweta's profound interest in financial research and quantitative analysis led her to pursue a career as an investment analyst.

The images reveal a new fascia complete with a new grille and headlamps. Also visible are large chrome inserts on the edges of the face confirming that the car we saw in a BNCAP crash test image for the Punch EV was the Magnite facelift. The overall design of the tail lamps remains unchanged but the individual elements within have been redesigned and give the car a fresh look.\n\nThe cabin of the 2024 Magnite was revealed by Nissan and the real-world images confirm elements like the new seat upholstery, updated steering wheel and dual-tone colour scheme. One of the big USPs of the car is expected to be an air filter system and we expect that it will be offered as standard fitment across the range. Other major features include a 360-degree camera, connected car technology, height adjustment for the driver’s seat, digital instrument cluster, climate control with rear AC vents, power mirrors and windows and finally wireless phone mirroring.\n\nThe Magnite is expected to continue with its two 1.0-litre engines. The lower-spec one is a 1.0-litre NA petrol that produces 71bhp and 96Nm and can be had with either a five-speed MT or a five-speed AMT. The more powerful option is a 1.0-litre turbo petrol with 99bhp/160Nm and this engine is available with either a six-speed MT or a CVT.",

This mid-life refresh brings some styling updates and also introduces a couple of new features. However, no mechanical changes have been made to the compact SUV. These prices are, however, introductory and will apply to the first 10,000 deliveries, which commence tomorrow.\n\nMagnite facelift gets styling tweaks inside and out\n\nRetains 72hp and 100hp 1.0-litre petrol engines\n\nHere's a look at the detailed price list of the new Magnite:\n\nNotably, the prices for the base petrol-MT and petrol-AMT variants remain unchanged. Nissan also claims that the base AMT and CVT variants of the Magnite are the most affordable ones, of any vehicle in India. Nissan has also completely revised the variant nomenclature with this update.\n\nNissan Magnite facelift: exterior, interior design\n\nThe majority of the changes are concentrated on the face of the SUV. The updated Magnite gets a wider and larger grille with more chrome and gloss-black elements, and it now merges with the headlamps. Additionally, the bumper now features a more prominent faux skid plate with integrated fog lamps. The headlamps also get a new signature for the LED DRLs, although the overall shape remains largely unchanged. The L-shaped LED DRLs on the bumper have been retained.\n\nThe profile remains largely unchanged, but it gets new 16-inch alloy wheels. At the rear, the tail lamps get new LED signatures, with intricate detailing. It also gets a new Sunrise Cooper colour shade.\n\nInside the cabin, the all-black theme of the pre-facelift Magnite has been replaced with a dual-tone copper and black layout for the dashboard, door pads, and seat upholstery. The previous black and silver finish on the steering wheel has made way for a full black unit. It also gets new textured panels on the door pads, dual-tone leatherette upholstery, and new four-colour ambient lighting on the dashboard and door pads.\n\nFeatures such as the 8-inch touchscreen, rear AC vents, auto climate control, 360-degree camera, and wireless charger, have all been carried over. It also gets an updated 7.0-inch digital instrument cluster with revised graphics, new auto headlamps, auto dimming IRVM, new type-C charging ports, and a new key fob with remote start. However, unlike most of its rivals, it still does not get an electric sunroof. On the safety front, the car now gets six airbags, ESC, three-point seatbelts and seatbelt reminders for all seats, as standard.\n\nNissan Magnite facelift: powertrain, price, rivals\n\nThe Magnite facelift carries over the 72hp, 96Nm, 1.0-litre NA petrol and 100hp, 160Nm engine options. A 5-speed manual gearbox is standard across both. The nat-asp engine gets an optional 5-speed AMT, while the turbo-petrol engine gets a CVT option.

    "# Comprehensive Report on Magnite, Inc. and its Advertising Platform\n\n## Company Overview\nMagnite, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGNI) is recognized as the world's largest independent sell-side advertising company, providing a comprehensive platform for publishers to monetize their digital advertising inventory across various formats, including Connected TV (CTV), online video, display, and audio. The company was formerly known as The Rubicon Project, Inc. and rebranded to Magnite in July 2020. Founded in 2007 and headquartered in New York City, Magnite operates globally, with offices in major cities across North America, EMEA, LATAM, and APAC [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/).\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, Magnite employed approximately 911 full-time employees and reported a market capitalization of approximately $1.68 billion [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/). The company has shown resilience in the competitive digital advertising landscape, with a focus on programmatic advertising solutions that connect publishers with advertisers efficiently.\n\n## Financial Performance\nIn the second quarter of 2024, Magnite reported a revenue of $162.9 million, marking a 7% increase year-over-year. The contribution ex-TAC (Traffic Acquisition Cost) was $146.8 million, up 9% year-over-year, with CTV contributing $63 million, a 12% increase from the previous year [(Magnite, 2024)](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/MGNI/magnite-reports-second-quarter-2024-7lm1fumn92pc.html). Despite these gains, the company reported a net loss of $1.1 million, significantly improved from a loss of $73.9 million in the same quarter of the previous year [(Magnite, 2024)](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/MGNI/magnite-reports-second-quarter-2024-7lm1fumn92pc.html).\n\nThe company has also successfully reduced its interest expenses by $2.7 million annually through a recent term loan repricing, which lowered the interest rate by 75 basis points [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/news/).\n\n## Strategic Partnerships and Acquisitions\nMagnite has been actively expanding its partnerships to enhance its service offerings. Notably, it partnered with TELUS Communications to leverage its SpringServe ad server and Streaming SSP for programmatic advertising in Canada [(TELUS Communications, 2024)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magnite-chosen-as-the-preferred-technology-partner-to-enhance-telus-connected-tv-offering-302191700.html).

The company has been focusing on automating its Prebid wrapper optimization, which has resulted in a 5% increase in ad spend for its partners [(AdExchanger, 2024)](https://www.adexchanger.com/publishers/magnite-tackles-fully-automated-prebid-wrapper-optimization/). This automation allows publishers to optimize their ad auctions in real-time, improving revenue potential.\n\nMoreover, Magnite's integration with major platforms like Netflix and Mediaocean has expanded its programmatic capabilities, allowing advertisers to access premium inventory more efficiently [(StockNews.com, 2024)](https://stocknews.com/news/mgni-nexn-crto-tbla-is-magnite-a-top-pick-in-digital-advertising/).\n\n## Market Position and Analyst Sentiment\nDespite facing challenges, including a recent dip in stock price, analysts remain cautiously optimistic about Magnite's growth potential. The company has been recognized for its strong performance in the CTV segment, which is expected to continue growing as more advertisers shift their budgets to digital platforms [(StockNews.com, 2024)](https://stocknews.com/news/mgni-nexn-crto-tbla-is-magnite-a-top-pick-in-digital-advertising/). The stock has gained approximately 44.9% year-to-date, reflecting positive investor sentiment amidst a volatile market [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/news/).\n\n## Executive Insights\nMichael G.

Ad spend trends from the first half continue to be positive, and we remain optimistic this momentum will carry forward\" [(Magnite, 2024)](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/MGNI/magnite-reports-second-quarter-2024-7lm1fumn92pc.html). This sentiment underscores the company's commitment to leveraging its technological advancements to capture market share in the evolving digital advertising landscape.\n\n## Conclusion\nMagnite, Inc. stands as a key player in the digital advertising sector, with a robust platform that connects publishers and advertisers effectively. The company's strategic partnerships, financial performance, and ongoing product innovations position it well for future growth. However, potential investors should remain aware of the inherent volatility in the advertising market and the company's recent financial losses.
