The company was founded to provide solutions that empower publishers to monetize their ad inventory effectively. Magnite operates globally, with offices in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, London, and Singapore [(iHeartMedia, 2024)](https://investors.iheartmedia.com/news/news-details/2024/iHeartMedia-and-Magnite-Unify-Access-to-Broadcast-and-Digital-AudioProviding-Advertisers-with-a-Direct-Path-to-Premium-Inventory/default.aspx).\n\nMagnite offers a range of services aimed at optimizing advertising revenue for publishers. These services include Open Bidding, which allows publishers to monetize their inventory through a competitive bidding process, and SpringServe, a platform designed to facilitate the sale of ad inventory by providing tools for managing and optimizing ad delivery. The company's product offerings also include Ad Inventory Management, Data Governance, and Monetization Solutions that support various ad formats across desktop, mobile, and video platforms [(Careers Overview)](https://www.magnite.com/careers/).\n\nMagnite serves a diverse clientele, including publishers, advertisers, and agencies, and aims to enhance their advertising capabilities and maximize revenue potential. The company operates on a B2B model, with notable partnerships such as those with TargetSmart for data-driven political advertising and TELUS Communications for enhancing advertising opportunities in Canada [(Magnite, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/news/).\n\nFinancially, Magnite reported a revenue increase of 7% year-over-year for the second quarter of 2024, totaling $162.9 million. Despite a net loss of $1.1 million, this was a significant improvement from a loss of $73.9 million in the same quarter the previous year [(Magnite, 2024)](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/MGNI/magnite-reports-second-quarter-2024-7lm1fumn92pc.html).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nMichael G. Barrett serves as the President and CEO of Magnite. He has expressed optimism about the company's future, citing a positive ad spend environment and strategic gains as key factors for the company's growth [(StockNews.com, 2024)](https://stocknews.com/news/mgni-nexn-crto-tbla-is-magnite-a-top-pick-in-digital-advertising/). The leadership team at Magnite is composed of experienced professionals from the advertising and technology sectors, driving the company's vision and strategic direction [(Careers Overview)](https://www.magnite.com/careers/).\n\n# News\n\n## Financial Performance and Market Position\n\nMagnite's financial results for the second quarter of 2024 showed a revenue increase of 7% year-over-year, with CTV revenue specifically increasing by 12% to $63 million. Despite these gains, the company reported a net loss of $1.1 million, a significant improvement from a loss of $73.9 million in the same quarter the previous year [(Magnite, 2024)](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/MGNI/magnite-reports-second-quarter-2024-7lm1fumn92pc.html). Analysts have noted that the company is perceived as one of the \"worst advertising stocks\" by short sellers, indicating skepticism regarding its future performance. However, the company has shown resilience, with a stock price increase of 81.1% over the past nine months [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/news/).\n\n## Partnerships and Collaborations\n\nMagnite has been actively expanding its partnerships to enhance its programmatic advertising capabilities. The company entered into an exclusive partnership with TargetSmart to facilitate data-driven political advertising across CTV inventory [(Magnite, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/news/). Additionally, Magnite was selected as the preferred technology partner for TELUS Communications, leveraging its SpringServe ad server and Streaming SSP to enhance advertising opportunities in Canada [(TELUS, 2024)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magnite-chosen-as-the-preferred-technology-partner-to-enhance-telus-connected-tv-offering-302191700.html).\n\n## Strategic Acquisitions and Product Innovations\n\nIn September 2024, Magnite completed a term loan repricing, reducing its interest rate by 75 basis points, which is expected to save the company over $2.7 million annually in interest payments [(Magnite, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/news/). The company has introduced several innovations, including the Demand Manager tool, which automates Prebid wrapper optimization, enhancing the efficiency of programmatic advertising for publishers [(Vargas, 2024)](https://www.adexchanger.com/publishers/magnite-tackles-fully-automated-prebid-wrapper-optimization/). Magnite is also focusing on expanding its CTV offerings, with a recent partnership with Netflix expected to significantly boost its CTV revenue stream [(Vargas, 2024)](https://www.adexchanger.com/tv/magnite-continues-steady-growth-powered-by-programmatic-ctv/).\n\n## Executive Insights\n\nMichael G. Barrett, President and CEO of Magnite, expressed optimism about the company's future, stating, \"A positive ad spend environment to start 2024, plus our share gains, have led to a great start to the year, and we remain optimistic this momentum will continue\" [(StockNews.com, 2024)](https://stocknews.com/news/mgni-nexn-crto-tbla-is-magnite-a-top-pick-in-digital-advertising/). This sentiment is echoed by analysts who see potential for growth, particularly in the CTV segment, which is expected to continue expanding as programmatic adoption increases [(Vargas, 2024)](https://www.adexchanger.com/tv/magnite-continues-steady-growth-powered-by-programmatic-ctv/).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMagnite, Inc. is positioned as a leader in the independent sell-side advertising space, with a strong focus on programmatic solutions and strategic partnerships. While the company faces challenges in a competitive market, its recent financial performance and innovative product offerings suggest a positive trajectory. Prospective candidates and investors should consider the company's growth potential, particularly in the CTV sector, while remaining aware of the inherent risks associated with the advertising technology industry.",

      "# [Open Bidding FAQ on 2023-09-01](https://www.magnite.com/openbiddingfaq/)\n1. I reviewed the Terms & Conditions and found some language that I was not comfortable agreeing to. Can I propose changes/redlines?\n\nUnfortunately, given the high volume of Google Open Bidding publishers who are participating in this program, Magnite is unable to accommodate any custom changes/redlines to the Terms & Conditions at this time.\n\n2. How long does it normally take Magnite to review my submission?\n\nMagnite is doing its best to expedite the review of each submission and expects the review process to normally take up to three business days. Magnite thanks you for your patience as this new Open Bidding program is rolled out.\n\nIf approved, Magnite will require that you update your Ads.txt/App-Ads.txt file in order to monetize your inventory. It is recommended that you get a head start by inserting the following line item:\n\nrubiconproject.com, 22884, DIRECT, 0bfd66d529a55807\n\nMagnite also recommends that you bookmark the Google OB Terms you consented to by bookmarking the following URL. This will allow you to access these legal terms for future reference.\n\n4. It’s been a week. Will I receive email notification from Magnite once I am approved or rejected?\n\nDue to the high volume of submissions, Magnite will not be able to send you a separate email notification once your inventory starts monetizing. However, your application’s status will appear in your applicable Bidder’s UI interface (Google Ad Manager or Google Admob) as one of three statuses:\n\n“Pending” – your submission is still under review\n\n“Approved” – your submission was approved and monetization should begin soon\n\n“Rejected” – your submission was rejected\n\n5. When I checked my status in my Google Bidder’s UI interface (AdManager or Admob), it shows my status as “rejected.” How can I find out the reasons for the rejection? Is there a way I can appeal the decision?\n\nDue to the high volume of submissions received and Magnite’s focus on reviewing all submissions as quickly as possible, Magnite is unable to provide detailed rejection reasons or offer a path to appeal at this time. To increase your chances of approval, please make sure to provide detailed & accurate information when initially submitting your information.\n\n6. I did not enter any billing information when I submitted my form. How will Magnite provide me performance reporting and know how to pay me?\n\nOne of the value propositions of the Google Open Bidding program is to offer publishers consolidated billing/reporting. Google will be providing you performance reporting and remitting payments directly to you. You will not receive a login to the Magnite platform.\n\n7. What ad formats or sizes does Magnite support?\n\nMagnite supports monetization across a wide variety of ad formats and industry-standard sizes, including desktop web, mobile web, mobile app, and video. Ad formats include, but are not limited to, banners, interstitials, in-stream or outstream, and rewarded video.\n\n8. Which countries is Magnite able to do business with under this program?\n\nIf your inventory becomes approved, and as long as your company is not registered to do business in, nor has its principal place of business located in, any of the countries listed HERE, then you are eligible to work with Magnite.\n\n9. What if I have new domains or app bundles that I wish to monetize with Magnite, but were not included in my original submission? How do I get those approved?\n\nIf you have new inventory that Magnite hasn’t reviewed, please provide your Google Publisher ID and any new domain and/or app bundle details to Magnite’s email alias of OBSupport@magnite.com. If/when it is approved, you can begin sending that inventory to Magnite for monetization.\n\n10. I have ad inventory available for monetization from many different countries. Which countries will Magnite be able to monetize?\n\nThere are some exceptions, but you can expect Magnite to be able to monetize a wide array of ad formats in most major countries around the world.\n\n11. I don’t have my Google Publisher ID readily available. Is that going to be a problem to get approved?\n\nIt is important that you provide your Google Publisher ID when submitting your application to Magnite. If you are having trouble locating your Google Publisher ID, you can click here if you are an Admob publisher and click here if you are a Google Ad Manager publisher for more information. Please also note that if you require additional email support for any reason after your submission, please make sure to include your Google Publisher ID in your email inquiry to expedite a reply from Magnite.\n\n12. I still have additional unanswered questions. Should I email my Google or my Magnite representative?",

As to both parties, Confidential Information also includes business and marketing plans, software code, technology and technical information, product and system designs and configurations, specifications, APIs, trade secrets, and business processes. However, Confidential Information shall not include any information that: (i) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to Disclosing Party; (ii) was known to Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party without restriction on use or disclosure; (iii) was independently developed by Receiving Party without reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information or breach of any obligation owed to Disclosing Party; or (iv) is rightfully received from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure.\n\n(b) Restrictions; Use. Receiving Party shall not use or disclose the Confidential Information of Disclosing Party, without Disclosing Party’s consent, for any purpose other than to perform Receiving Party’s obligations or exercise its rights under the Agreement, as of the Effective Date or as subsequently updated. Such disclosures shall only be made to those third parties who are bound by confidentiality obligations with respect to such Confidential Information that are at least as protective as those set forth herein, and Receiving Party shall be responsible and liable for the failure of any such third party to treat the Confidential Information in accordance with Receiving Party’s obligations. Receiving Party shall protect the confidentiality of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in the same manner that it protects the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind (but in no event using less than reasonable care). Receiving Party shall promptly notify Disclosing Party if it becomes aware of any actual or reasonably suspected unauthorized disclosure of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.\n\n(c) Legal Disclosure. If Receiving Party is compelled by law or legal process to disclose the Confidential Information of Disclosing Party, it shall provide Disclosing Party with (i) prompt prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and (ii) reasonable assistance, at Disclosing Party’s expense, if Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. In any event, such disclosure shall be strictly limited to the Confidential Information that is required to be so disclosed by law or legal process.\n\n4.2 Privacy and Data Usage.\n\n(a) Privacy Laws. Customer shall ensure that its use of the SpringServe Materials, including with regard to any data and/or data segments that Customer uploads or has uploaded on its behalf, complies with its obligations under (i) all applicable privacy laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and any other laws materially similar in form or scope to the foregoing, and including any rules promulgated pursuant to the foregoing and each as amended from time to time (collectively, the “State Privacy Laws”), the Regulation 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) (“GDPR”), the GDPR as incorporated into United Kingdom law pursuant to section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal Act) 2018 (“UK GDPR”), and any implementation of the European Union Directive 2002/58/EC (as modified by Directive 2009/136/EC), and any replacement legislation, and (ii) generally accepted privacy self-regulatory guidelines, such as the principles of the Digital Advertising Alliance and the code of the Network Advertising Initiative, as updated, supplemented or amended from time to time, ((i) and (ii), collectively, the “Privacy Laws”). When sending Ad requests to Magnite, Customer shall honor and not inhibit, circumvent, disrupt, or otherwise compromise the actual user choice to opt out (including to opt out of “targeted advertising”, “sharing”, or “sales” of personal data as such terms are defined in the State Privacy Laws), limit ad tracking, or other similar setting or preference, as indicated by the end user, with respect to each applicable application or platform.\n\n(b) Privacy Policies. Customer agrees to post on its website and all Media an up-to-date and accurate privacy policy, and/or provide the appropriate link to such a policy within its Media, that: (i) complies with all applicable Privacy Laws and (ii) accurately discloses all applicable data collection, use, and disclosure practices, including, but not limited to, an explanation of the purposes for which data is collected by or will be transferred to, third parties, the use of cookies, pixels, beacons, locally stored objects, or other similar technologies by third parties for purposes of targeting individual end users with interest-based, and other types of advertisements. Customer and each seller of the Media shall comply with its respective privacy polic(ies). Customer further agrees that its and the Media privacy polic(ies) will provide (i) consumers subject to the State Privacy Laws a functioning method to opt-out of “sales”, “sharing” and “targeted advertising” by the Customer as required by the State Privacy Laws; and (ii) all end users with a conspicuous link to a functional opt-out page. If Customer uses the SpringServe Materials to buy or sell Ad Inventory directly or indirectly on behalf of any third party, Customer will ensure that such third party complies with this Section 4.2.\n\n(c) Data. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, Magnite shall have the right to collect, use, and disclose data transmitted through or otherwise derived from Customer’s use of the SpringServe Materials as described in the applicable Magnite privacy polic(ies).\n\n(d) Required Consent. To the extent that any data, including persistent identifiers (such as IP address or device identifiers) or precise geo-location data, about end users are collected, used, transmitted, or processed by or on behalf of Customer or a party on behalf of which Customer is directly or indirectly buying or selling Ad Inventory using SpringServe Materials, Customer represents and warrants that all necessary disclosures have been provided to and appropriate consents have been or will be obtained from such end user (“Required Consents”), as applicable. These Required Consents include, but are not limited to, those necessary to collect information about individual end users through the use of technologies, such as cookies and pixels, located on the end user’s device, and to pass such information to Magnite for processing in accordance with the Agreement. All Required Consents shall be obtained by Customer before any such technologies are set on the applicable end user’s device, regardless of whether such technologies are set directly by Customer or by or through Magnite. Customer shall not directly or indirectly pass Magnite any information that permanently identifies a particular device.\n\n(e) European Data Protection Law. Magnite collects certain data from Customer’s use of the SpringServe Materials, which may include end user “personal data” as defined in European data protection law (“Personal Data”). Magnite and Customer shall process such personal data as data controllers. Customer and Magnite agree to implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect the Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, loss of integrity, and against all other unlawful forms of processing. Further, Magnite and Customer will not process any Personal Data outside of Europe, unless it first implements appropriate safeguards for the Personal Data that satisfy the requirements of European data protection law.\n\n(f) State Privacy Laws. For purposes of State Privacy Laws, Magnite will receive such personal information as a third party and acts as a controller with respect to such personal information. In the event of changes to the State Privacy Laws or issuance of applicable regulation, court order or governmental guidance relating to the State Privacy Laws, Magnite may modify the terms of the Agreement if such change does not have a material adverse impact on Customer and only if mutually agreed upon in writing. For purposes of this Section 4.2(f), (i) the terms “commercial purpose”, “consumer”, “controller”, “personal information”, “processor”, “process”, “sale”, “share” and “targeted advertising” as used herein have the meanings given in the CCPA and (ii) references to “controller”, “personal information” and “processor” include “business”, “personal data” and “service provider” respectively.\n\nMagnite and Customer will comply with their respective obligations under State Privacy Laws with respect to the processing of personal information governed by the Agreement and, where applicable, will also require that their vendors comply with the same.\n\nWhere processing deidentified data, Magnite and Customer further agree to (i) not attempt to reidentify such data; (ii) use reasonable administrative, technical and organizational measures to prevent reidentification or inadvertent release of the data; and (iii) publicly commit to maintain and use the data in deidentified form and not attempt to reidentify the data.\n\nAdditional CCPA Commitments:\n\nIf personal data is subject to the CCPA, this Section “Additional CCPA Commitments” applies. Magnite will: (i) comply with applicable obligations under the CCPA, including by providing the same level of privacy protection as required of “businesses” under the CCPA; (ii) notify Customer if it can no longer meet its obligations under the CCPA; and (iii) grant Customer the right to take reasonable and appropriate steps to help ensure Magnite is using the personal information in a manner consistent with the CCPA, such as by requesting information or an attestation from Magnite.\n\nIf Customer believes that Magnite is engaged in unauthorized use of personal data provided by Customer, upon notice to Magnite, the Parties will work together in good faith to stop or remediate the allegedly unauthorized use of such personal information, as necessary. Where Magnite receives from Customer personal information subject to the CCPA, Customer makes such personal information available to Magnite for the commercial purposes of performing advertising and related services, as further specified in the Agreement and Magnite will process such personal information only for such purposes and subject to any restrictions outlined in the Agreement.\n\n(g) Kids’ Sites. Customer shall not make Ad Inventory available on a Kids’ Site (as defined below), unless permitted by Magnite in a written amendment signed by both parties. As used herein, “Kids’ Site” refers to any Media: (a) directed to children located in the U.S. (or any U.S. territory thereof) who are under the age of 16; (b) directed to children located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) who are younger than the applicable age required for parental consent; or (c) directed to children, as defined by laws of any other jurisdiction. Customer may not, except to the extent permitted by applicable law, use the SpringServe Materials to: (i) create profiles of visitors of Kids’ Sites or of any users that Customer knows to be under the applicable age of parental consent requirements (“Kids”); (ii) purchase, sell, place, or facilitate the placement of behaviorally targeted Ads on Kids’ Sites; or (iii) collect personal information (as defined by the United States’ Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act), personal data (as defined by GDPR), or comparable data under any similar law of any jurisdiction, about Kids or visitors of Kids’ Sites. Magnite undertakes no obligation to identify Kids Sites or to monitor the compliance of Buyers or Sellers with respect to identifying Kids Sites.\n\nTERM AND TERMINATION\n\n5.1 Term. The Agreement begins on the Effective Date and will continue until terminated as permitted. Each party may terminate the Agreement in whole or terminate any individual Service at any time for any reason, without penalty, by providing thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the other party. The termination of an individual Service will not impact the term of the Agreement or any other Service, unless the provision of another Service depends upon the terminated Service (in which case, both Services will be deemed terminated).\n\n5.2 Suspension; Termination. In addition to its other termination rights specified in the Agreement, Magnite may limit and/or suspend Customer’s access to and use of the SpringServe Materials (including ceasing purchase, sale, delivery, or serving of Ads or Ad Inventory) if Magnite has a reasonable basis to suspect that (a) Customer is violating the terms of the Agreement, (b) Customer’s account remains inactive for at least twelve (12) months, (c) Customer’s use of the SpringServe Materials is likely to damage or cause harm or risk to Magnite, the SpringServe Materials, other customers, or end users of Media or their data, devices, or systems, or (d) Customer becomes insolvent or generally unable to pay its debts as they become due, or becomes the subject of any bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution, or similar proceeding, or has made an assignment for the benefit of creditor or similar disposition of its assets. Magnite will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with notice prior to any limitation or suspension, but in any event will notify Customer promptly thereafter. If an event giving rise to a limitation or suspension is able to be cured (as reasonably determined by Magnite), Customer shall have five (5) days to cure (“Suspension Window”). If Customer has not cured before the expiration of the Suspension Window, or the limitation or suspension is not able to be cured (as reasonably determined by Magnite), then Magnite may terminate the Agreement or any Service in whole or in part upon written notice (email acceptable).\n\n5.3 Effect of Termination. Upon termination of the Agreement or any Service in whole or in part, the following will apply either in total or in relation to the individually terminated Service, as applicable: (a) all access rights granted to the SpringServe Materials shall immediately terminate; (b) Customer will cease all use of SpringServe Materials; and (c) the following will survive: (i) any provisions specified by their terms to survive; and (ii) provisions of the Agreement that, by their nature, are applicable to matters at issue between the parties after termination of the Agreement, such as accrued unpaid payment obligations, limitation of liability, indemnities, confidentiality, and proprietary rights.\n\nREPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; DISCLAIMER\n\n6.1 Mutual Representations and Warranties. Each party represents and warrants to the other that: (a) it has the full corporate right, power, and authority to enter into the Agreement and to exercise its rights and perform its obligations; (b) its execution and delivery of the Agreement, and the performance of its obligations and duties in connection therewith, do not and will not violate any agreement to which it is bound; and (c) it shall comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations in performing its respective obligations and exercising its rights under the Agreement, including with respect to consumer protection and privacy.\n\n6.2 Disclaimer. Except for the express representations and warranties stated herein and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither party makes, and each party expressly disclaims, all representations, conditions, terms and warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the subject matter of the Agreement, including without limitation any implied representation, term, or warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Without limiting the generality of the above and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Magnite makes no representation or warranty (a) as to any Ad or Media or any benefit, performance, or revenues that Customer (or Customer’s clients or users) will obtain from its use of the SpringServe Materials, (b) that any particular Buyer relationships will be established or maintained through the SpringServe Services, (c) that Ads will be available for delivery or at a particular price, or (d) that the SpringServe Materials will be always available or bug or error-free.\n\nINDEMNIFICATION\n\n7.1 Customer Obligations. Subject to Section 7.3, Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Magnite, its permitted successors and assigns, and their respective Affiliates, agents, officers, directors, and employees (collectively, “Magnite Indemnified Parties”) from and against any claims, suits, legal proceedings, regulatory proceedings, or investigatory proceedings (“Claims”) brought against any Magnite Indemnified Party by any third party and any and all judgments, losses, damages, settlements, liabilities, fines, penalties, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) (“Losses”) arising as a result of any such Claim, in each case as a result of or in connection with: (a) any false or misleading representation by Customer or any breach by Customer of any of its warranties or obligations under the Agreement; and (b) a Claim that Media provided or delivered by Customer through the SpringServe Materials, Customer’s Marks, or Customer’s business activities infringe any Intellectual Property Right of any third party ((a) – (b) each being a “Customer Indemnifiable Act”).\n\n7.2 Magnite Obligations. Subject to Section 7.3, Magnite shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Customer, its successors and assigns, and their respective Affiliates, agents, officers, directors, and employees (“Customer Indemnified Parties”) from and against any Claim brought against any Customer Indemnified Party by any third party and any Losses arising as a result of any such Claim, in each case as a result of or in connection with: (a) any false or misleading representation by Magnite or any breach by Magnite of any of its warranties or obligations under the Agreement; or (b) a Claim that the SpringServe Materials, when used in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, infringe any Intellectual Property Right of any third party. In the event a Claim under Section 7.2(b) is made or, in Magnite’s reasonable opinion, is likely to be made, or if required by settlement, Magnite may elect, at its sole option and expense, to: (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the SpringServe Materials that are the subject of such Claim, (ii) replace or modify the SpringServe Materials that are the subject of such Claim to be non-infringing without material decrease in functionality, or (iii) terminate the Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Magnite shall have no liability for any infringement Claim under this Section 7.2 to the extent such Claim results from: (i) modifications to the SpringServe Materials by or on behalf of a Customer Indemnified Party, or (ii) use or combination of any SpringServe Materials with any other item not provided by Magnite; in each case without the prior written consent of Magnite.\n\n7.3 Procedure.\n\n(a) Notice and Reasonable Assistance. In the event of a Claim, the indemnified party shall provide prompt notice of the Claim to the indemnifying party. A failure to provide prompt notice shall not release the indemnifying party from its indemnification obligations under the Agreement, but it will reduce those indemnification obligations by the amount (if any) of additional Losses attributable to the delayed notification. The indemnified party shall also provide reasonable information and assistance needed to defend or settle the Claim (provided the indemnifying party bears any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the indemnified party in providing such assistance or information).\n\n(b) Control of Claim. The indemnifying party of any Claim shall have sole control of the investigation, defense, and settlement of the Claim, provided that the indemnifying party does not enter into any settlement of a Claim that: (i) imposes a monetary obligation on the indemnified party that is not covered by the indemnification; (ii) imposes a material, non-monetary obligation on the indemnified party; (iii) does not include an unconditional release of the indemnified party; (iv) admits liability on the part of the indemnified party; and/or (v) is non-confidential (collectively, the “Settlement Restrictions”). Any settlement that does not comply with the Settlement Restrictions in full will require the prior written consent of the indemnified party.\n\nLIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n\n8.1 Limitations; Liability Cap. SUBJECT TO SECTION 8.2, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL (A) EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR (B) EITHER PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER IN CONNECTION WITH THE AGREEMENT, UNDER ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY, EXCEED U.S. $250,000 (OR ITS EQUIVALENT).\n\n8.2. Exclusions. THE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY SET FORTH IN SECTION 8.1 SHALL NOT APPLY TO: (A) A BREACH OF SECTION 3.1 (RIGHT TO ACCESS AND RESTRICTIONS); (B) A BREACH OF SECTION 4.1 (CONFIDENTIALITY); (C) A CLAIM FOR INDEMNIFICATION UNDER SECTION 7.1; (D) THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, OR FRAUDULENT, CRIMINAL, OR MALICIOUS CONDUCT OF THE PARTY SEEKING TO LIMIT ITS DAMAGES; OR (E) AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO MAGNITE UNDER THE AGREEMENT.\n\nBINDING ARBITRATION & CLASS ACTION WAIVER\n\n9.1 Arbitration. As a material part of the Agreement, any and all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to the Agreement shall be determined exclusively by confidential, final, and binding arbitration as follows:\n\n(a) General. Unless the parties mutually agree to another arbitration service provider, the matters submitted to arbitration shall be heard and determined by a single arbitrator in Los Angeles (or another mutually agreed upon venue), in accordance with the then-existing comprehensive arbitration rules or the streamlined arbitration rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”). Any party to the arbitration may request JAMS to identify panels of retired or former jurists qualified and able to sit as arbitrators of the matters submitted for arbitration and the arbitrator determining the submitted matters shall be selected from such panels pursuant to JAMS rules. Except as otherwise determined by the arbitrator, the fees of the arbitration charged by JAMS initially will be paid equally by both parties. However, the arbitrator shall have the right to order either party to pay all fees and costs as part of the award.\n\n(b) Waiver; Final Award. By agreeing to submit all disputes, claims and controversies to binding arbitration, Customer and SpringServe expressly waive their rights to have such matters heard or tried in court before a judge or jury or in another tribunal. Unless an arbitrator commits errors of law or legal reasoning, any arbitration award shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties, subject only to judicial review provided by statutes governing arbitrations, and a judgment rendered on the arbitration award may be entered in any state or federal court having jurisdiction thereof.\n\n9.2 Class Action Waiver. Customer and Magnite agree that each may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, mass action, or representative action.\n\nTAXES. Customer is solely responsible for payment of any Taxes applicable to its transactions under the Agreement and/or its use of any Service (whether those Taxes are collected and remitted by Magnite or paid directly to the relevant authorities by Customer), except for Taxes based on Magnite’s net income. Customer shall provide Magnite with an IRS form W9 or W-8BEN, as applicable. Upon Magnite’s request and as applicable, Customer shall also provide Magnite with a treaty residency certificate, VAT registration proof, and/or any other relevant documents for tax compliance purposes.\n\nIf and only if Customer is currently based or becomes based (whether as the original Customer or through assignment of this Agreement) in a jurisdiction outside of the United States to which withholding taxes apply, then the following language will also apply: Any applicable Taxes not collected by Magnite from Customer shall be paid by Customer to the relevant authorities directly, and in such circumstances, Customer shall: (a) gross-up such payment to fully-account for such Tax, (b) immediately tender the relevant amount of Tax to the appropriate authorities, and (c) promptly thereafter, inform Magnite in writing that such Taxes have been paid and provide such documentation (including original receipts or other governmental documentation, or copies thereof) as may reasonably be requested by Magnite to ensure that Magnite is satisfied that it will not bear any financial liability of Tax to such authorities in respect of such payment. To the extent that Customer reasonably determines that any payment to Magnite is subject to withholding Tax, Customer shall provide prompt notification to Magnite of such fact in writing, and Magnite shall thereafter provide Customer with a treaty residency certificate, or other similar governmental document, as reasonably requested by Customer.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\n\n11.1 Assignment. Customer may not assign, subcontract, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any or all of its rights and/or obligations under the Agreement without the prior written consent of Magnite (not to be unreasonably withheld). Customer is not required to obtain the prior written consent of Magnite in the event of a Change of Control of Customer, provided that the acquirer(s) assumes Customer’s obligations hereunder after such Change of Control and provided further that the Change of Control does not involve a direct competitor of Magnite, as determined by Magnite in its sole discretion. Customer shall notify Magnite of any Change of Control permitted by this Section 11.1 within 30 days of the consummation thereof. As used herein, “Change of Control” means (a) the merger or consolidation of Customer with another entity; (b) a transaction or series of related transactions in which a third party becomes the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the combined voting power of the outstanding securities of Customer; or (c) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Customer. Any attempted assignment by Customer in breach of this Section 11.1 shall be void. The provisions of the Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties’ respective transferees, successors, and assigns.\n\n11.2 Governing Law; Venue. The Agreement will be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California without reference to conflicts of laws principles. Jurisdiction and venue for all disputes hereunder shall be in Los Angeles County, California. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to the Agreement.\n\n11.3 Non-Exclusive Relationship. The Agreement is non-exclusive and either party may engage in similar or other relationships, agreements, or arrangements with any other party.\n\n11.4 Independent Relationship of the Parties. The relationship between Customer and Magnite (and its personnel or agents) in connection with the Agreement is at all times that of an independent contractor and neither party is an employee, partner, agent, trustee or joint venturer of, for, or with the other. Except to the extent otherwise provided in the Agreement or under applicable law, neither party shall owe any fiduciary or other duties to the other.\n\n11.5 Other Customers. To the extent that another customer of Magnite incurs Losses as a result of any Customer Indemnifiable Act, Customer acknowledges and agrees that such other customer may recover such Losses from Customer directly and will be deemed a third-party beneficiary of this Section 11.5.\n\n11.6 Interpretations. Headings and captions are for convenience only and do not affect the meaning or interpretation of the Agreement. Ambiguities, inconsistencies, or conflicts in the Agreement will be resolved by applying the most reasonable interpretation under the circumstances, giving full consideration to the parties’ intentions at the time the Agreement was entered into and common practice in the industry at that time. The term “including” or “includes” means “including/includes without limitation.” The Agreement shall not be construed against any party by reason of its drafting, preparation, or means of acceptance.\n\n11.7 Public Relations. During the Term of the Agreement, Magnite may use Customer’s Marks in general promotional and informational materials. Except as permitted in the Agreement, neither party shall use the name of the other party in publicity, advertising, or other public materials (unless required by applicable law or regulation) without the prior written consent of the other party.\n\n11.8 Notices. All notices under the Agreement must be made in writing. Notices to Customer shall be made in the applicable user interface (“UI”) for the Service or by email to then-current contact information available to Magnite. Notices to Magnite shall be made by email to legal@magnite.com. Electronic notice will be effective as of the date of posting (for notice within the UI) or as of the sent date (for email notice).\n\n11.9 Advice of Counsel. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL AND HAS READ AND UNDERSTOOD ALL OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THE AGREEMENT.\n\n11.10 Modifications. Magnite will provide Customer with written notice via email or through a general notice displayed within the applicable Service of any material changes (including applicable fees), additions, or deletions to the Agreement applicable to Customer (“Modifications”). If Customer determines in its reasonable discretion that a Modification will have a material, adverse effect on Customer, then for a period of ten (10) business days after the date of notice by Magnite (the “Termination Window”), Customer may, as its sole and exclusive remedy for any Modification, terminate the Agreement upon written notice to Magnite. By continuing to access or use the SpringServe Materials after such Termination Window, Customer agrees to be bound by such Modification.\n\n11.11 Force Majeure. Except for any payment obligations, neither party nor its Affiliates will be liable for any delay or failure to perform hereunder due to circumstances beyond such party’s reasonable control including earthquake, flood, fire, hurricane, tornado, natural disaster, acts of God, riot, national emergency, epidemic or other public health emergency, quarantine, government action or regulation, war, invasion, act of foreign enemies, hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorism, civil war, rebellion, revolution, radiation, other toxic or hazardous contamination, nuclear accident or explosion, restrictions on commodities or supplies, strikes or industrial disputes, or disruptions involving power or infrastructure systems not within such party’s possession or reasonable control (each a “Force Majeure Event”).\n\n11.12 Export Compliance. Customer agrees to comply with the export laws and regulations of the United States and with applicable trade controls of other countries (and that in cases of conflict or inconsistency among applicable export and import laws and regulations, U.S. law shall govern). Customer shall not use the SpringServe Materials to conduct, promote or facilitate business, or target end users in countries subject to U.S. embargo or trade sanctions.\n\n11.13 Anti-Corruption. Customer agrees (a) to comply with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and UK Bribery Act 2010, in relation to the Agreement; and (b) that it will not offer to pay or pay anything of value to anyone, including foreign governmental officials or related persons or entities on Magnite’s behalf.",

I have stock in Magnite and I have been watching this companies stock drop day after day. It makes me wonder if there is something going on behind the scenes or if there is some underlying issue causing this to drop day after day after day. It could just be because it’s not as speculative an investment as say Pubmatic or TTD. \n\nI know this Reddit sub is for programmatic discussion so feel free to share insights or anything you might find related to this. I mainly wanted to hear some other peoples opinions on MGNI. \n\nThanks for reading!\n\n## Comment ID hmmfwfb with +6 score by [(OutMotoring, Reddit, 2021-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/r5d6j5/magnite_stock_price/hmmfwfb/) (in reply to ID r5d6j5):\nP/E ratio is $408.00.

I would also look at their balance sheet ie debt.\n\n### Comment ID hmmnmcg with +2 score by [(Drewbtube7, Reddit, 2021-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/r5d6j5/magnite_stock_price/hmmnmcg/) (in reply to ID hmmfwfb):\nGotcha!

If demand is low they  can buy cheaper. \n\nSell side (Magnite) has more of a dependency on demand to make the whole operation worthwhile. They also want to keep in good standing with great publishers competing against Google and Amazon is difficult as they have competitive advantages (search/YouTube and e-commerce retargeting).\n\nOTT and CTV are still not as big as YouTube and Facebook video ads. These companies receive ad dollars first.\n\n### Comment ID hmobcue with +1 score by [(Drewbtube7, Reddit, 2021-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/r5d6j5/magnite_stock_price/hmobcue/) (in reply to ID hmob4mf):\nThank you for the insight!

On the publisher side I really like PUBM. They have been trending up even during these down days. Current I am selling (options) 10 contracts at $30 for Dec 17 since I’m fairly confident it won’t drop that low.

Their revenue is still growing at a decent pace but their margins have gone down fairly significantly, with the combined increased cost of revenue and spending on sales and marketing outpacing revenue growth. Which leads to questions about their scalability and long term profitability, and negatively impacts the DCF models that institutions use to valuate the company\n\n### Comment ID hmpno88 with +1 score by [(Drewbtube7, Reddit, 2021-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/r5d6j5/magnite_stock_price/hmpno88/) (in reply to ID hmpj7jx):\nThanks for the insights on on these factors!

Their stock price will likely stabilize into a new trading range over the next week or two though as the price gets closer to firms' new NPV estimate and selling pressure fades",
      "# Post ID 14h1uro: Preferred suppliers for direct deals with +7 score by [(Any_Lawfulness4277, Reddit, 2023-06-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/14h1uro/preferred_suppliers_for_direct_deals/)\nI'm curious if anyone has any preferred suppliers they like to work directly with/have seen good results with?  OR the inverse, which suppliers left a sour taste in your mouth? \n\nI work specifically in with SMB eComms in TTD & StackAdapt, primarily display & native. I totally understand suppliers can very by channel or audience (or both). I'm mostly in the discovering phase right now, exploring what's out there. \n\n## Comment ID jp8mwva with +6 score by [(Lumiafan, Reddit, 2023-06-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/14h1uro/preferred_suppliers_for_direct_deals/jp8mwva/) (in reply to ID 14h1uro):\nMagnite is probably my preferred partner for CTV and online video. Audigent is worth exploring as a way to overcome some of the impending cookieless challenges we'll all face in the display and online video space.\n\nI don't have a *ton* of experience working on direct deals for native, but I'd imagine you could engage either Magnite or Audigent for those, too.\n\n### Comment ID jp8spug with +1 score by [(Any_Lawfulness4277, Reddit, 2023-06-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/14h1uro/preferred_suppliers_for_direct_deals/jp8spug/) (in reply to ID jp8mwva):\nAppreciate it! Anything specific for display? Or still Magnite/Audigent?\n\n#### Comment ID jp95lr1 with +1 score by [(Lumiafan, Reddit, 2023-06-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/14h1uro/preferred_suppliers_for_direct_deals/jp95lr1/) (in reply to ID jp8spug):\nYup, I realized I probably worded that comment poorly. I use Magnite more so for CTV and online video, but they're a good enough partner in general that I could easily recommend them for display. Audigent is more of a forward-looking partner in terms of working to reduce the impact of cookie deprecation. They don't have quite the same presence as some other suppliers out there, and they work off of the Xandr exchange, but the offerings are intriguing enough to check out.\n\n## Comment ID jpasr1f with +3 score by [(capitalifelendinginc, Reddit, 2023-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/14h1uro/preferred_suppliers_for_direct_deals/jpasr1f/) (in reply to ID 14h1uro):\nInteresting question. I've been simply reaching out to publishers directly, like PMC for example and making direct deals if their properties are good for target audiences. But seeing others mention Magnite, etc has me confused.\n\nCan anyone care to elaborate how or why would they contact Magnite, instead of going directly to publishers?\n\n### Comment ID jpdctcs with +2 score by [(jammin_potato, Reddit, 2023-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/14h1uro/preferred_suppliers_for_direct_deals/jpdctcs/) (in reply to ID jpasr1f):\nSSPs provide scale and reach.

However, Walmart does not offer this type of service. \n\nWalmart has their own DSP, built on top of the Trade Desk, where you build custom audiences based on past purchases of specific SKUs tied to your brand. You can also create custom audiences of purchasers based on an entire category.  In addition, there are pre-built Persona segments like Busy Families and demo segments that you can tap into. You can also use non-Walmart data segments, and they are tapped into most SSPs, so it truly is a full on DSP\n\nBecause they own their DSP, they are able to see the entire bid stream, which is how they figure out the attribution. They're keep track of everyone that your campaign served an impression to by utilizing some form of anonymized ID,  and if a person then makes a purchase, they will attribute that purchase and revenue to your campaign. This is typically tracked through credit card # and email addresses to create their own proprietary ID graph and tying it back to the anonymized ID in the bid stream. They utilize a 14 day and a 30 day lookback window - anybody who was served an ad but made a purchase outside of these windows will not be attributed. They also have a machine learning product to tie back \"cash paying customers\" to the campaign (which I don't really believe is that accurate and inflates their revenue numbers).\n\nEssentially, a PMP offering wouldn't allow for matching up of users targeted vs users who bought, because the audiences gets ported out of the attribution ecosystem (if that makes any sense). It could technically be done if you sent over the exposure log files from the DSP to the PMP partner in order for them to actually attempt to do anything, but I'm not actually aware of any company who actually does this.\n\nSo to answer your questions:\n\n1. Xandr isn't involved in the situation, apart from maybe their supply that the DSP can tap into.\n\n2. Matching IDs from targeting and tying it back to their own propriety ID graph.\n\n3. PMP isn't possible here, and in the Walmart DSP, they're connecting to supply vendors just like any other DSP and bidding in real time.\n\n### Comment ID lqb496q with +1 score by [(Turnbasedgod, Reddit, 2024-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1fvz91i/can_someone_explain_whats_going_on_behind_the/lqb496q/) (in reply to ID lqazwnj):\nThank you for typing that out - and sorry I should've just said \"Retailer A\" instead of Walmart I meant it as more of a general example, but reading between the lines in your response: If it was a Retailer that I setup a PMP through and ran it through the DSP of my choice (assuming they allowed that), they wouldn't be able to do that in-store attribution.

This allows them to track the full chain of ad impressions and tie them back to purchases, using things like loyalty programs, credit card data, or proprietary ID graphs.\n\nIn a PMP setup, it becomes more challenging to match users and attribute in-store sales because the data often exits the retailer's ecosystem. That kind of attribution is more feasible when the retailer owns or manages both sides, making the integration seamless.\n\nIf the retailer isn’t directly managing both sides, achieving in-store attribution through a PMP would require more complex integrations, such as using exposure log files from the DSP to attempt that matching, but that’s far from a standard practice today.\n\n#### Comment ID lqbdbmm with +2 score by [(workredditaccount555, Reddit, 2024-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1fvz91i/can_someone_explain_whats_going_on_behind_the/lqbdbmm/) (in reply to ID lqb496q):\nAll good.

That allows them to essentially anonymize this ID and send it over vi the PMP for targeting. If the targeted user completes a purchase for the advertisers item, they are able to tie it back to an exposure. \n\nNot sure what the inventory is, but I imagine some of it is on the Walmart site.

All good then, haha\n\n\nIm going to use different examples to mitigate confusion. \n\nYou = programmatic trader for Burger King,\nDSP = DV360,\nSSP = Magnite\n\n\nBurger King collects data. Commonly a collection of cookie IDs of people they think are interested in Burger King. This data is pushed to DV360. You can now apply it as an audience in DV360 to only target these people. \n\nAt this point, you have an audience, but no *inventory*. \n\nSo, you reach out to Magnite. You tell them about the campaign and say you want a PMP of food-related inventory. Magnite, who owns inventory across many many sites, curates a list for you and builds a deal in their platform. \n\nSince this is a private marketplace deal, they only want Burger King to use it. Rather than pushing it so everyone on DV360 can use it, they push it to the Burger King seat in DV360. To do this, they need the seat ID from you. \n\nOnce pushed, they’ll give you the deal ID. You can now accept the deal using this ID in DV360. Once accepted, you can apply it to the campaign.\n\nIf you didn’t need a curated PMP or a preferred rate, you could just use the existing inventory in DV360, no need to reach out to Magnite. You could then apply a site list to curate the inventory yourself. \n\n\nNow you activate the campaign. The DSP keeps the bid request data for all impressions served. Maybe it’s the device ID, maybe IP, email. The information isn’t important. The fact is, data for each user served is stored. \n\nNow, Burger King collects data as well. Maybe they are tracking the IPs of users that connect to their WiFi. Maybe they are tracking people within a certain radius of their stores. Maybe they are getting device info tied to credit card transactions. There are many methods, but if this data can be tied back to the impression data in DV360, a conversion is attributed to the campaign.\n\nOffline measurement is tough and far from perfect. There are offline measurement partners such as Inmarket or Foursquare that make it easier. They can help with the attribution process. They can also measure foot traffic of a particular store to measure lift as well. \n\n\n\nI think a big part is your confusion of terms. PMP is a private marketplace deal. This is inventory. Sites, apps, streaming services, etc. Audiences are digital “pools” of users, commonly cookie IDs. \n\nAudience = People,\nDeal/PMP = Inventory\n\nInventory is of course mandatory. You need to buy as space in order to deliver an impression. Audiences are optional. They are just used as a way to slim down the targeting in order to reach more focused users.\n\n## Comment ID lqf6aga with +1 score by [(BidTheory, Reddit, 2024-10-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1fvz91i/can_someone_explain_whats_going_on_behind_the/lqf6aga/) (in reply to ID 1fvz91i):\nThat specific PMP traffic and audience represents a very small part of the total bidstream available in the market. Xandr has a role making sure their pre-targeting sends as much traffic (bid requests) as possible for that specific traffic so you can bid on it. Normally the SSP should give priority to PMP traffic versus general open market traffic to make sure the DSP gets as much of it as possible.\n\nIt doesn’t make sense for DSPs (or SSPs) to exchange traffic none of the DSPs campaigns are bidding for or buying. A running PMP likely has an active buyer in the DSP and therefore the SSP (Xandr) should make sure as much of that as possible gets through so you can buy it.\n\n## Comment ID lqrn84y with +1 score by [(TechyRuben, Reddit, 2024-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1fvz91i/can_someone_explain_whats_going_on_behind_the/lqrn84y/) (in reply to ID 1fvz91i):\nSo based on the scenario you described, here are concise answers to your three questions: \n\nXandr acts as the Supply-Side Platform (SSP) for Retailer A (Walmart). It manages Retailer A's ad inventory, facilitates the creation of Private Marketplace (PMP) deals, and integrates with Retailer A's first-party data to enable audience targeting. \n\nWalmart likely uses a combination of methods to link online ad exposure to in-store purchases, such as loyalty programs, email matching, device ID tracking, etc.\n\nThe inventory in the PMP likely comes from a combination of sources. This includes Retailer A's own digital properties, such as their website and mobile app. It may also include inventory from partner networks with which Walmart has established agreements. Additionally, Walmart might secure some inventory through programmatic guaranteed deals with various publishers, which they then include in the PMP offering. Rather than pre-purchasing inventory to resell, Walmart is more likely curating a package of their own and partner inventory, making this bundle available to selected advertisers through the PMP. This approach allows Walmart to offer a diverse range of ad placements while maintaining control over who can access this premium inventory.",

The reason for loss is due to \"Auctions Lost\", which is frustrating because we don't have control over the bid since its a PG deal. We are also only receiving roughly 10% of the impressions needed to fulfill the PG deal. So if we ordered 1 Million impressions, the deal would only send over 100K for the lifetime of the campaign.

Usually it’s something related to creatives that isn’t apparent until the full tag gets sent. I’m probably oversimplifying (because this part is over my head) but it seems like the DSP knows you sent a bid to the external auction, and knows you didn’t win, so it gets classified as “auction loss” even though you may have a winning bid but some other technical issue. In my experience, if there is an issue it’s either creative/tagging incompatibility (your publisher should be be able to confirm/give more insight) or something like your advertiser category being disallowed from serving on specific content (think alcohol/tobacco brands, explicit content, etc)\n\nFundamentally, if the publisher guarantees a certain amount of impressions, it’s on them to ensure you win enough auctions to fulfill that deal and 10% is very low for PG deals, especially if the total bid request volume available isn’t enough in the first place.\n\n## Comment ID jk9kxac with +2 score by [(BestAd1682, Reddit, 2023-05-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/13d71zp/issues_with_nbc_pg_deals_delivering_through_dv360/jk9kxac/) (in reply to ID 13d71zp):\nIt's interesting - I never thought there would be scaling issues with PG deals.

SSPs are not motivated in the same way to improve their wrappers since it's not their core business. Some examples of the richer feature set: adaptive/multiplex ads, smart refresh, interactive ads, dynamic floors optimized by AI, bidder optimization per GEO/device/website, traffic shaping, timeout optimization per GEO/device/website, anti-malvertising, auto-in-content units, asynchronous ad loading, adblock revenue recovery, multi-platform & flexible ad sizes support...

Both are good options - although we've seen more success with Publica from both a tech and customer service standpoint.\n\n#### Comment ID i7abr4d with +1 score by [(MonsieurBishop, Reddit, 2022-05-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/udwrh9/which_ctv_adtech_should_we_use/i7abr4d/) (in reply to ID i6qi7kz):\nI don’t manage any specific markets, though some are harder than others to get demand for.  \n\nYou are correct that they don’t have demand built in, but once you do set up those demand sources the results are much higher than the other options. \n\nIf you aren’t looking for that type of hassle, there are companies like mine or others that have all the accounts necessary and the ad server in place so it is turn key.  \n\nTrick is though, you want to work with someone who isn’t basing their setup off of the Display model and the tools that serve it.\n\n### Comment ID lrceqbx with +1 score by [(RMGads, Reddit, 2024-10-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/udwrh9/which_ctv_adtech_should_we_use/lrceqbx/) (in reply to ID i6q2ufv):\nPM me MonsieurBishop - I just created my first-ever reddit account to reach out, but I guess it won't let me PM because account is new.\n\n## Comment ID i6l60v2 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-04-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/udwrh9/which_ctv_adtech_should_we_use/i6l60v2/) (in reply to ID udwrh9):\nDepends on your business. If you’re platform diverse, I suggest freewheel (or gam if you want to suffer through their services and support). Publica and spring serve are big players who think specifically about ctv. The bigger content businesses are multi platform; they lean towards solutions which can handle all of it like freewheel.\n\n### Comment ID i6lj6uv with +1 score by [(federoll, Reddit, 2022-04-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/udwrh9/which_ctv_adtech_should_we_use/i6lj6uv/) (in reply to ID i6l60v2):\nYes, the idea is to have a solution 100% focused on CTV\n\n## Comment ID ii2hepx with +2 score by [(Individual-Round2908, Reddit, 2022-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/udwrh9/which_ctv_adtech_should_we_use/ii2hepx/) (in reply to ID udwrh9):\nCheck out Column6 ..

          "cons": "Magnite pay is well below industry standard. I was told by HR when leaving the company that Magnite does not want to be known as a top paying company. This leads mid/junior employees to have higher turnover rates than expected.\n\nA lot of teams are very top-heavy, which leaves no room or possibility for others to get promoted. I was at Magnite for over 5 years, and we never once did a proper year end, employee evaluation. At other companies, you typically do your evaluation with your manager in December, who then provides feedback on how to grow in your career. Where you stand in terms of performance should not be a surprise, but at Magnite it is. When January comes around, random people get promoted, and your manager will just look at you shrug and say there wasn't enough budget for anyone else to get promoted. Given promotions only happen once a year, this is an extremely upsetting situation to be in, and is the exact reason why many people leave the company. \n\nEach team's RTO is different. Understandably, RTO is the new normal, but then everyone should be held to the same standard. There are engineers that need to be in the office 3x a week, but then several SALES people are allowed to work completely remote? People who lead large teams are completely remote? The company needs a more fair stance. It seems only senior level people at the company got permission to be remote, while everyone else is held to a different standard.",

C-level management was either incompetent or so out of touch they end up being incompetent, I couldn't tell. Middle management is a bunch of yes-men (men, no women) who aggressively play the \"just go with it even though it's a bad plan, it will get fixed eventually\" card and as far as I can tell they are all highly loaded with stock and just playing a waiting game to dump it all as soon as it vests.. I can't blame them there. Day to day is a slew of overstaffed meetings that should have been (or already were) tracked issues and don't really accomplish anything with some spurts of work thrown in. At SpotX I would be able to get about 20-25 hours per 40hr week of active work completed and Magnite I was peaking in the mid to low teens. It seems from my view that every piece of infrastructure is set up by only skimming documentation and then getting it to a place at which it just barely functions then moving on and never ever coming back to get it out of alpha stage. Bugs become features, duct tape becomes structural and all that. Honestly I have never seen a more toxic work environment. The back to office mandate that all but management follows was a cherry. I loved spotx because of the teams and attitude of all trying to push in the same direction and we all tried that at magnite when we got acquired.. and got promptly thrown under every bus they could find. I'm glad I got a package, others were not so lucky. Beware of the politics in middle management, some of them can lie very well, and pay attention to who is the one pulling their strings. Check the companies cycle of funding, quarterly reports and then immediate stock dumps by all employees.",

C-level management was either incompetent or so out of touch they end up being incompetent, I couldn't tell. Middle management is a bunch of yes-men (men, no women) who aggressively play the \"just go with it even though it's a bad plan, it will get fixed eventually\" card and as far as I can tell they are all highly loaded with stock and just playing a waiting game to dump it all as soon as it vests.. I can't blame them there. Day to day is a slew of overstaffed meetings that should have been (or already were) tracked issues and don't really accomplish anything with some spurts of work thrown in. At SpotX I would be able to get about 20-25 hours per 40hr week of active work completed and Magnite I was peaking in the mid to low teens. It seems from my view that every piece of infrastructure is set up by only skimming documentation and then getting it to a place at which it just barely functions then moving on and never ever coming back to get it out of alpha stage. Bugs become features, duct tape becomes structural and all that. Honestly I have never seen a more toxic work environment. The back to office mandate that all but management follows was a cherry. I loved spotx because of the teams and attitude of all trying to push in the same direction and we all tried that at magnite when we got acquired.. and got promptly thrown under every bus they could find. I'm glad I got a package, others were not so lucky. Beware of the politics in middle management, some of them can lie very well, and pay attention to who is the one pulling their strings.

        "cons": "Magnite pay is well below industry standard. I was told by HR when leaving the company that Magnite does not want to be known as a top paying company. This leads mid/junior employees to have higher turnover rates than expected.\n\nA lot of teams are very top-heavy, which leaves no room or possibility for others to get promoted. I was at Magnite for over 5 years, and we never once did a proper year end, employee evaluation. At other companies, you typically do your evaluation with your manager in December, who then provides feedback on how to grow in your career. Where you stand in terms of performance should not be a surprise, but at Magnite it is. When January comes around, random people get promoted, and your manager will just look at you shrug and say there wasn't enough budget for anyone else to get promoted. Given promotions only happen once a year, this is an extremely upsetting situation to be in, and is the exact reason why many people leave the company. \n\nEach team's RTO is different. Understandably, RTO is the new normal, but then everyone should be held to the same standard. There are engineers that need to be in the office 3x a week, but then several SALES people are allowed to work completely remote? People who lead large teams are completely remote? The company needs a more fair stance. It seems only senior level people at the company got permission to be remote, while everyone else is held to a different standard.",

Free lunch, great culture. unlimited PTO, 4 mandatory mental health days per year, and more.",

It worked better than I thought it would. But like most other corporations, stop with the drum beating and emptiness of setting goals as if we are cattle to be herded and prodded. Goal-setting itself isn't the problem -- the way it is forced and meaningless is. You want employees that *want* on their own to make the company better ... right? At least one of the subsidiaries you acquired had a better way of achieving this than you do. And this isn't nostalgia or hurt due to change. It doesn't have to be like that subsidiary ... but you could learn a lot from what worked there to be better than just cookie-cutter-corporate a lot of the time.",

      "# [MGNI: Is Magnite a Top Pick in Digital Advertising? by StockNews.com Staff on 2024-07-07](https://stocknews.com/news/mgni-nexn-crto-tbla-is-magnite-a-top-pick-in-digital-advertising/)\nThe digital advertising landscape is expanding rapidly as consumers spend more time online. Brands are fiercely competing for attention across websites, social media platforms, and mobile apps. This competition has driven a surge in digital ad spending, with the global market projected to exceed $1.37 trillion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 9.6% from 2024 to 2033.\n\nShould investors seeking a slice of this growing pie consider investing in Magnite, Inc. (MGNI)? Valued at a $1.89 billion market cap, the company operates a prominent independent sell-side advertising platform, connecting publishers with advertisers. It provides access to premium ad spaces across the web, mobile apps, Connected TV (CTV), and audio.\n\nMGNI exceeded Wall Street’s expectations in the first quarter with strong top and bottom-line results. Contribution ex-TAC for CTV significantly surpassed the high end of their guidance range, reaching $130.60 million, up 12% year-over-year. Moreover, their CTV segment saw an 18% year-over-year rise to $54.89 million, while DV+ grew 9% to $75.70 million.\n\nMichael G. Barrett, President and CEO of MGNI, commented, “We finished the quarter with strong CTV upside in live sports, related to March Madness, as well as strong continued growth in ad serving, both contributing to share gains. DV+ also posted strong results with growth of 9%.”\n\n“A positive ad spend environment to start 2024, plus our share gains, have led to a great start to the year, and we remain optimistic this momentum will continue. There is a clear trend to consolidation in our space, and we believe the strongest, technically superior, scaled players that deliver the best monetization, will capture market share gains,” he added.\n\nShares of MGNI have gained 81.1% over the past nine months and 44.9% year-to-date, closing the last trading session at $13.53. However, the stock has dipped marginally over the past month.\n\nLet’s look at factors that could influence MGNI’s performance in the upcoming months.\n\nRecent Strategic Partnership\n\n3 STOCKS TO DOUBLE THIS YEAR\n\nOn June 18, the company announced an expanded partnership with Spectrum Reach, the advertising sales arm of Charter Communications, Inc. This partnership enhances programmatic ad-buying access across Spectrum Reach’s vast library of premium linear and streaming TV inventory.\n\nThe agreement extends MGNI’s full programmatic capabilities to Spectrum’s latest video delivery technology, allowing ad buyers to bid on individual impressions in real time. Additionally, ad buyers will benefit from centralized planning and frequency management across linear and digital platforms.\n\nIn March, MGNI and Mediaocean announced an exclusive partnership to enhance automation and supply path efficiency for connected TV (CTV) and online video (OLV) advertising. This partnership allows Mediaocean’s Prisma buyers to directly activate streaming campaigns with premium video sellers through MGNI’s ClearLine solution. It builds on their 2023 deal, which integrated Magnite’s streaming inventory into Mediaocean’s ad infrastructure for local TV buyers.\n\nMixed Financials\n\nFor the first quarter that ended March 31, 2024, MGNI’s revenue increased 14.7% year-over-year to $149.32 million, beating the analysts’ revenue estimate of $124.16 million. Its adjusted EBITDA rose 7.2% from the year-ago value to $26.03 million. Its non-GAAP net income grew 38.8% from the previous year’s quarter to $7.98 million. Furthermore, the company’s adjusted EPS came in at $0.05, up 25% year-over-year.\n\nHowever, its loss from operations for the quarter was $13.83 million. The company’s cash outflow from operating activities amounted to $60.41 million, up 95.5% from $30.89 million in the year-ago period. Also, as of March 31, 2024, MTDR’s cash and cash equivalents decreased to $252.83 million, compared to $326.22 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\nFavorable Analyst Expectations\n\nAnalysts expect MGNI’s revenue and EPS for the second quarter (ended June 2024) to grow 6.9% and 72.1% year-over-year to $144.10 million and $0.15, respectively. Moreover, the company surpassed consensus EPS and revenue estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, which is remarkable.\n\nFor the fiscal year ending December 2024, Street expects MGNI’s revenue to increase 10.6% from the prior year to $607.77 million. The company is expected to post an earnings per share of $0.82, indicating a 52.3% year-over-year growth.\n\nIn addition, the company’s revenue and EPS for the fiscal year 2025 are expected to increase 10.8% and 13.6% year-over-year to $673.57 million and $0.93, respectively.\n\nMixed Valuation\n\nIn terms of forward non-GAAP PEG, MGNI is trading at 0.44x, 68.3% lower than the industry average of 1.37x.\n\nHowever, the stock’s forward EV/Sales and EV/EBITDA multiples of 3.73 and 11.48 are 98.1% and 50.5% above the respective industry averages of 1.88 and 7.63. Likewise, its forward non-GAAP P/E ratio of 16.45x is 29.9% higher than the industry average of 12.66x.\n\nMixed Profitability\n\nMGNI’s trailing-12-month levered FCF margin of 29.61% is 246.1% higher than the 8.56% industry average. Also, the stock’s trailing-12-month Capex/Sales of 4.42% is 22% higher than the industry average of 3.62%.\n\nHowever, its trailing-12-month EBITDA margin of 11.89% is 36.3% lower than the industry average of 18.65%. MGNI’s trailing-12-month net income margin and ROCE of negative 12.24% and negative 11.17% compares to the respective industry averages of 2.87% and 3.56%.\n\nPOWR Ratings Reflect Uncertainty\n\nMGNI’s mixed fundamentals are reflected in its POWR Ratings. The stock has an overall rating of C, which translates to Neutral in our proprietary rating system. The POWR Ratings are calculated by taking into account 118 different factors, with each factor weighted to an optimal degree.\n\nOur proprietary rating system also evaluates each stock based on eight distinct categories. MGNI has earned a B grade for Sentiment, consistent with optimistic analyst estimates.\n\nHowever, the stock has a C grade for Value and Quality, in sync with its mixed valuation and profit margins. Also, MGNI has a D grade for Stability, justified by its five-year beta of 2.34.\n\nWithin the B-rated Advertising industry, MGNI is ranked #8 out of 16 stocks.\n\nBeyond what I have stated above, we have also given MGNI grades for Growth and Momentum. Get all MGNI ratings here.\n\nBottom Line\n\nMGNI showed resilience in the first quarter of 2024, surpassing revenue expectations and demonstrating growth in adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income. This performance underscores its solid position in the digital advertising space, especially with its strategic partnerships aimed at enhancing programmatic ad-buying efficiency.\n\nHowever, the company reported a loss from operations and a substantial increase in cash outflow from operating activities compared to the previous year, reflecting challenges in managing costs and cash flow.\n\nWhile Magnite’s initiatives to enhance programmatic ad-buying capabilities and expand into connected TV are promising, the stock’s high volatility and current valuation suggest caution for potential investors. Given these mixed signals, waiting for a better entry point in this stock seems prudent.\n\nHow Does Magnite, Inc. (MGNI) Stack Up Against Its Peers?\n\nWhile MGNI has an overall grade of C, equating to a Neutral rating, you may check out these A (Strong Buy) rated stocks within the Advertising industry: Nexxen International Ltd. (NEXN), Criteo S.A. (CRTO), and Taboola.com Ltd.

Ad spend trends from the first half continue to be positive, and we remain optimistic this momentum will carry forward as Magnite growth accelerates in the back half of 2024,” said Michael G. Barrett, President and CEO of Magnite.\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Results Summary(in millions, except per share amounts and percentages)Three Months EndedSix Months EndedJune 30, 2024June 30, 2023Change\n\nFavorable/ (Unfavorable)June 30, 2024June 30, 2023Change\n\nFavorable/ (Unfavorable)Revenue$162.9$152.57%$312.2$282.710%Gross profit$100.3$22.4348%$183.7$27.7563%Contribution ex-TAC(1)$146.8$134.79%$277.3$250.711%Net loss($1.1)($73.9)99%($18.8)($172.6)89%Adjusted EBITDA(1)$44.7$37.320%$69.8$60.715%Adjusted EBITDA margin(2)30%28%2 ppt25%24%1 pptBasic and diluted loss per share($0.01)($0.54)98%($0.13)($1.27)90%Non-GAAP earnings per share(1)$0.14$0.0956%$0.20$0.1354%\n\nFootnotes:(1)Contribution ex-TAC, Adjusted EBITDA, and non-GAAP earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures.

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as \"may,\" \"might,\" \"will,\" \"objective,\" \"intend,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"can,\" \"would,\" \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"design,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" \"plan\" or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the Company’s guidance or expectations with respect to future financial performance; acquisitions by the Company, or the anticipated benefits thereof; potential synergies from the Company's acquisitions; macroeconomic conditions or concerns related thereto; the growth of ad-supported programmatic connected television (\"CTV\"); our ability to use and collect data to provide our offerings; scope and duration of client relationships; the fees we may charge in the future; our anticipated financial performance; key strategic objectives; anticipated benefits of new offerings; business mix; sales growth; benefits from supply path optimization; the development of identity solutions; client utilization of our offerings; our competitive differentiation; our market share and leadership position in the industry; market conditions, trends, and opportunities; certain statements regarding future operational performance measures; and other statements that are not historical facts. These statements are not guarantees of future performance; they reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and estimates and subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from expectations or results projected or implied by forward-looking statements.\n\nWe discuss many of these risks and additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by our forward-looking statements under the headings \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" and elsewhere in this press release and in other filings we have made and will make from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of the report in which they are included. Unless required by federal securities laws, we assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated, to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the statements are made. Without limiting the foregoing, any guidance we may provide will generally be given only in connection with quarterly and annual earnings announcements, without interim updates, and we may appear at industry conferences or make other public statements without disclosing material nonpublic information in our possession. Given these uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Investors should read this press release and the documents that we reference in this press release and have filed or will file with the SEC completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Operational Measures:\n\nIn addition to our GAAP results, we review certain non-GAAP financial measures to help us evaluate our business on a consistent basis, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of investments in our technology and development and sales and marketing, and assess our operational efficiencies. These non-GAAP measures include Contribution ex-TAC, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Income (Loss), and Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) per share, each of which is discussed below.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, or as superior to, the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments, and review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP measures, and the reasons we consider them appropriate. It is important to note that the particular items we exclude from, or include in, our non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the items excluded from, or included in, similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. See \"Reconciliation of Revenue to Gross Profit to Contribution ex-TAC,\" \"Reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA,\" \"Reconciliation of net loss to non-GAAP income,\" and \"Reconciliation of GAAP loss per share to non-GAAP earnings per share\" included as part of this press release.\n\nWe do not provide a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial expectations for Contribution ex-TAC and Adjusted EBITDA, or a forecast of the most comparable GAAP measures, because the amount and timing of many future charges that impact these measures (such as amortization of future acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related charges, foreign exchange (gain) loss, net, stock-based compensation, impairment charges, provision or benefit for income taxes, and our future revenue mix), which could be material, are variable, uncertain, or out of our control and therefore cannot be reasonably predicted without unreasonable effort, if at all. In addition, we believe such reconciliations or forecasts could imply a degree of precision that might be confusing or misleading to investors.\n\nContribution ex-TAC:\n\nContribution ex-TAC is calculated as gross profit plus cost of revenue, excluding traffic acquisition cost (\"TAC\"). Traffic acquisition cost, a component of cost of revenue, represents what we must pay sellers for the sale of advertising inventory through our platform for revenue reported on a gross basis. Contribution ex-TAC is a non-GAAP financial measure that is most comparable to gross profit. We believe Contribution ex-TAC is a useful measure in assessing the performance of Magnite and facilitates a consistent comparison against our core business without considering the impact of traffic acquisition costs related to revenue reported on a gross basis.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA:\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment charges, interest income or expense, and other cash and non-cash based income or expenses that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance, including, but not limited to foreign exchange gains and losses, acquisition and related items, gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, other debt refinancing expenses, non-operational real estate and other expenses (income), net, and provision (benefit) for income taxes. We also track future expenses on an Adjusted EBITDA basis, and describe them as Adjusted EBITDA operating expenses, which includes total operating expenses. Total operating expenses include cost of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA operating expenses is calculated as Contribution ex-TAC less Adjusted EBITDA. We adjust Adjusted EBITDA operating expenses for the same expense items excluded in Adjusted EBITDA. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our performance for the following reasons:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company’s performance without regard to items such as those we exclude in calculating this measure, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired.\n\nOur management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies, and in communications with our board of directors concerning our performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also used as a metric for determining payment of cash incentive compensation.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA provides a measure of consistency and comparability with our past performance that many investors find useful, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, and also facilitates comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\n\nAlthough Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. These limitations include:\n\nStock-based compensation is a non-cash charge and will remain an element of our long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period.\n\nDepreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, and the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, but Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements.\n\nImpairment charges are non-cash charges related to goodwill, intangible assets and/or long-lived assets.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisition and related items, such as amortization of acquired intangible assets, merger, acquisition, or restructuring related severance costs, and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash and non-cash charges and changes in, or cash requirements for, acquisition and related items, such as certain transaction expenses.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash and non-cash charges related to certain financing transactions such as gains or losses on extinguishment of debt or other debt refinancing expenses.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in our working capital needs, capital expenditures, non-operational real estate expenses or income, or contractual commitments.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for income taxes and the cash impact of other income or expense.\n\nOther companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\nOur Adjusted EBITDA is influenced by fluctuations in our revenue, cost of revenue, and the timing and amounts of the cost of our operations. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nNon-GAAP Income (Loss) and Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) per Share:\n\nWe define non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share as non-GAAP income (loss) divided by non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding. Non-GAAP income (loss) is equal to net income (loss) excluding stock-based compensation, cash and non-cash based merger, acquisition, and restructuring costs, which consist primarily of professional service fees associated with merger and acquisition activities, cash-based employee termination costs, and other restructuring activities, including facility closures, relocation costs, contract termination costs, and impairment costs of abandoned technology associated with restructuring activities, amortization of acquired intangible assets, gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, non-operational real estate and other expenses or income, foreign currency gains and losses, interest expense associated with Convertible Senior Notes, other debt refinance expenses, and the tax impact of these items. In periods in which we have non-GAAP income, non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding used to calculate non-GAAP earnings per share includes the impact of potentially dilutive shares. Potentially dilutive shares consist of stock options, restricted stock units, performance stock units, and potential shares issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, each computed using the treasury stock method, and the impact of shares that would be issuable assuming conversion of all of the Convertible Senior Notes, calculated under the if-converted method. We believe non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance and our trends on a per share basis, and also facilitates comparison of our financial results on a per share basis with other companies, many of which present a similar non-GAAP measure. However, a potential limitation of our use of non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share is that other companies may define non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share differently, which may make comparison difficult. This measure may also exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. Non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share is a performance measure and should not be used as a measure of liquidity. Because of these limitations, we also consider the comparable GAAP measure of net income (loss).\n\nInvestor Relations Contact\n\nNick Kormeluk\n\n(949) 500-0003\n\nnkormeluk@magnite.com\n\nMedia

      "# [New Nissan Magnite compact SUV unveiled in India on 2024-10-04](https://global.nissannews.com/en/releases/new-nissan-magnite-compact-suv-unveiled-in-india)\nYOKOHAMA, Japan – Nissan today unveiled the new Magnite compact SUV in India, where it will be manufactured and sold. The new model combines sleek new styling, innovative technologies, optimum efficiency, and reinforced safety features.\n\nThe introduction of new Magnite across Africa, Middle East, and India comes as part of a broad product offensive and Nissan’s move to position India as a manufacturing hub under the Arc, Nissan’s mid-term business plan.\n\nNissan aims to export nearly 100,000 units to more than 65 markets in total by 2026, representing the largest coverage for a vehicle produced in Nissan’s Africa, Middle East, India and Oceania region.\n\nBold styling & advanced tech\n\nThe Magnite is a striking compact SUV, with robust exterior styling complemented by LED lights front and rear, alloy wheels and roof rails.\n\nInside, the new Magnite adds a configurable TFT driver display, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, for seamless smartphone integration, as well as a wireless smartphone charger. Life-on-board has been enhanced with the addition of four-color adjustable ambient lighting.\n\nAdditionally, innovative new features include remote engine start, walk away lock and approach unlock functions, cooled glove box storage, and an on-board air ionizer – ideal for customers with allergies or respiratory conditions.\n\nThe updated Magnite features six airbags across all variants and the bodyshell’s integrity is reinforced with the use of reinforced steel and an auto dimming rear view mirror is available.\n\nEfficient performance\n\nThe Magnite is powered by a turbocharged 1.0-liter engine, offering the optimum balance of fuel economy and responsive performance, which can be paired with either a manual or continuously variable transmission.\n\nIdeal for urban mobility\n\nDespite its compact dimensions, the Magnite can accommodate five passengers thanks to its generous wheelbase, making it ideal for urban mobility. This urban focus is enhanced further with the inclusion of Around View Monitor - which generates a bird’s-eye-view of the car from four cameras, ensuring parking in tight spaces is a low-stress exercise.\n\nExports to expand in 2025\n\nThe Magnite, launched in December 2020, has established a strong presence in India and has achieved cumulative sales of more than 150,000 units across India and international markets.\n\nNissan Motor India has until now exported the Magnite to 20 right-hand drive markets.

      "# [Magnite Tackles Fully Automated Prebid Wrapper Optimization by Anthony Vargas on 2024-08-01](https://www.adexchanger.com/publishers/magnite-tackles-fully-automated-prebid-wrapper-optimization/)\nWhen it comes to programmatic advertising, milliseconds matter.\n\nTo maximize revenue, publishers have to configure their Prebid setups to account for how quickly SSP auctions can respond to bid requests. Response times can vary based on factors like site visitors’ geographic region, what devices they’re using or whether the SSP has a server-side or client-side integration with the publisher.\n\nTypically, publishers have to make such adjustments to their Prebid wrappers manually. But automation is taking some of the pressure off.\n\nRanker, a website specializing in ranked lists voted on by its users, has been testing Prebid optimization for the past year via Demand Manager, a solution provided by its preferred SSP partner, Magnite. Demand Manager recently added a Prebid automation feature that is now available for broad adoption, Magnite announced today.\n\nPreviously, Ranker used Demand Manager for A/B testing different manual Prebid setups. But in April, Ranker began experimenting with the new feature, which fully automates Prebid wrapper optimization at the bid request level in real time. Between April and July, this automation produced a 5% increase in ad spend from Ranker’s demand partners, compared to a control group of unoptimized impressions, said Alex Mason, VP of programmatic sales, yield and strategy at Ranker.\n\nSolving the optimization problem\n\n“Prebid setup effectively is a massive optimization problem,” said Sunil Gupta, VP of product management at Magnite.\n\nConsider the task of manually setting Prebid auction timeouts: Setting timeouts too low can cause a publisher to miss out on winning bids from SSPs that take longer to respond. But setting timeouts too high can increase the chance the ad won’t render properly, which also has a detrimental effect on revenue.\n\nPublishers can make manual adjustments, but they can’t really account for the sheer variety of factors that can impact how quickly SSPs can respond to bid requests, such as how far certain geos are from data centers and whether the SSP prioritizes the type of ad inventory on auction, Gupta said.\n\nIn contrast, Demand Manager’s new automated optimization feature can tailor auction timeouts to the individual bid request at the moment the impression is served, Gupta said. Plus, it can make those adjustments outside of normal work hours.\n\nThe solution bases its optimization on past ad auctions run by the publisher and how well SSPs performed under different auction criteria. The solution silos this data on a per-publisher basis; optimizations that worked for other publishers do not inform how Ranker optimizes.\n\nThe potential impact of this automation on Ranker’s ad business could be substantial – the publisher currently earns about 50% of its digital ad revenue from Prebid, across both open exchange and private marketplace (PMP) deals, Mason said.\n\nRanker began testing Demand Manager’s new automation capabilities on a subset of its international traffic back in April. But after seeing positive results, Ranker has since expanded the tool across its entire Prebid display business, Mason added.\n\nFreeing up resources\n\n“Before Demand Manager, Ranker had its own in-house version of Prebid, which is great if you have a large team of developers that are only focusing on Prebid,” he said.\n\nBut with the web dev team spread across site development and Prebid, making small changes was a headache.\n\n“It was like pulling teeth if we wanted to add a new bidder, remove a bidder [or adjust] timeouts,” Mason said. “Having to tell a dev team that you want to increase timeouts – I don’t wish that on my enemies.”\n\nInstead, Ranker can now hand off Prebid optimization to Magnite, whose business is based on understanding the nuances of how Prebid setups affect auction dynamics, he said. Ranker’s web dev team can instead focus on webpage layouts and site updates, while its ad ops team can focus on optimizing direct campaigns, which bring in higher CPMs than programmatic.\n\nWhich SSP and when\n\nThe automation is also helping Ranker wrap its head around which SSPs are worth doing business with and which bid requests to send to which SSPs under which circumstances.\n\nRanker typically has between 10 and 12 active SSPs at a given time, Mason said. Some SSPs respond better to auctions based in certain regions, and some are only worth pinging for specific types of inventory. Demand Manager automatically surfaces those insights and adjusts which SSPs receive the bid requests accordingly.\n\nFor example, Magnite is Ranker’s primary demand partner for PMP deals. So, during times when Ranker has a lot of active PMPs in effect, Demand Manager can set Magnite as a high-priority bidder and give it first crack at PMP auctions, Mason said.\n\nRanker also works with Flipp, which serves native retail media placements through Prebid, but only on certain pages and under specific circumstances. Those Flipp ads monetize very well compared to other placements, so Ranker wants to prioritize serving them when it can, Mason said. Demand Manager can recognize when a Flipp ad is likely to win an auction and adjust the bid wrapper in real time to facilitate that, while avoiding sending bid requests Flipp won’t be interested in.\n\nGoing forward, Magnite anticipates updating Demand Manager to weigh the impact different alternative IDs have on demand, Gupta said.\n\nSuch a feature would be instrumental in helping publishers decide which ID partners and SSPs to work with, Mason said.\n\nMason has already used Demand Manager’s findings to cut SSPs from Ranker’s Prebid stack. And he’s also used it to test new demand partners before fully integrating them. Previously, Mason would evaluate demand partners across a quarter or multiple quarters.\n\n“It helps us prioritize our partners that are consistently performing, pick out the ones that are consistently underperforming, and makes that decisioning easier,” he said. “It gives me the ability to give newer partners a chance, rather than having this drawn-out process of evaluating them.”",
      "# [Magnite Continues Steady Growth Powered By Programmatic CTV by Anthony Vargas on 2024-08-08](https://www.adexchanger.com/tv/magnite-continues-steady-growth-powered-by-programmatic-ctv/)\nCTV is where the action is for Magnite.\n\nAlthough the full revenue impact of Magnite’s exclusive SSP partnership with Netflix hasn’t hit yet, simply announcing the deal, which happened in May, “created significant momentum for our business,” Magnite President and CEO Michael Barrett told investors on Wednesday.\n\n“New and existing customers [are] asking us how we can help them move faster into programmatic CTV advertising,” he said.\n\nMagnite’s CTV revenue was $63 million in Q2, up 12% YOY. By contrast, revenue from Magnite’s display and video (DV+) business – which includes everything other than CTV – was $84 million, up 7% YOY.\n\nMagnite’s total Q2 revenue was $147 million, a 9% year-over-year increase, with growth exceeding its guidance.\n\nCTV goes programmatic\n\nThe Netflix deal validates Magnite’s years of effort “to create the world’s leading holistic programmatic CTV platform,” Barrett bragged.\n\nHe also highlighted other recent big wins in the CTV space, including Magnite’s partnership with United Airlines to serve ads across its in-flight entertainment platform and the expansion of Magnite’s now seven-year partnership with Roku.\n\nBeyond these deals, Barrett pointed to three additional drivers of Magnite’s CTV growth: healthy overall ad spend, strength in the CTV ad serving market through its SpringServe ad server and increased programmatic adoption by big-name streaming platforms.\n\nMagnite already works with “just about every big [CTV] player out there,” Barrett said, although he did concede there are some big fish – namely YouTube – it will likely never catch.\n\nLarge streamers getting more involved in programmatic helped offset a slight downturn in CTV CPMs for the quarter, Barrett added.\n\n“We believe these [CPM reductions] are supply-driven by the largest industry players scaling their CTV inventory, and not from a drop-off in demand,” he said. “Volume increases have significantly offset CPM reductions, and we believe these trends of accelerating programmatic adoption will continue.”\n\nPlus, lower prices and more supply makes it easier for smaller buyers to enter the CTV market, which is a win for overall programmatic adoption, Barrett said.\n\nThe line on ClearLine\n\nBarrett also offered a few updates on ClearLine, Magnite’s self-serve direct buying solution for CTV, but didn’t share any hard numbers about that part of its business.\n\nClearLine, he said, is “continuing to gain adoption, and we are seeing very good growth, albeit off of a small base,” thanks to traction with agencies and brands that are in “testing and early development.”\n\nBarrett named Roku as a key early adopter of ClearLine and added that Magnite will begin launching ClearLine campaigns in partnership with omnichannel ad platform Mediaocean this coming quarter.\n\nCookie crumbs\n\nBut while much was said about CTV, Magnite didn’t offer much insight into what’s going on with its DV+ business.\n\nBarrett attributed DV+’s 7% YOY growth to Magnite scaling inventory, improving efficiency through traffic shaping and investing in podcast ad formats and digital out-of-home.\n\nHe also alluded to efforts to improve monetization and performance through the use of AI, such as the fully automated Prebid wrapper optimization feature the company added to its Demand Manager publisher tech offering last week. However, it’s unlikely such a new product is generating much revenue yet.\n\nIn response to an investor who inquired about DV+’s Q2 growth rate lagging behind Q1’s 9%, Barrett noted that “there’s always some volatility in the DV+ line.” He added that mobile experienced lighter than usual growth in the quarter, “but nothing to point a finger at.”\n\nBut speaking of volatility, Magnite accentuated the positives of Google backpedaling on its plans to phase out third-party cookies for all Chrome users. The decision should relieve short-term uncertainty around display CPMs, Barrett said.\n\nAnd Magnite doesn’t consider its investment in testing Google’s cookie alternative, the Privacy Sandbox, to be a sunk cost. “We are prepared to support Privacy Sandbox or a future iteration of it,” Barrett said, “for those that may want it.”",
      "# [Why Magnite Stock Rocketed Higher on Thursday by Danny Vena, www.facebook.com on 2024-05-16](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/05/16/why-magnite-stock-skyrocketed-thursday-morning/)\nShares of Magnite (MGNI -0.04%) charged sharply higher Thursday morning, surging as much as 31.4%. As of 11:53 a.m. ET, the stock was still up 30.5%.\n\nThe catalyst that sent the adtech specialist soaring was a new big-name ad partner.\n\nMillions of new ad watchers\n\nAt the ad industry upfronts -- the annual advertising sales event for television and streaming platforms -- Netflix (NFLX -0.79%) dropped several nuggets that made waves. First, the company revealed that its less expensive ad-supported tier has quickly grown to 40 million global accounts just 18 months after its debut. Even more surprising, the tally is up from 23 million in January.\n\nPerhaps more importantly to Magnite, Netflix said it planned to unveil its own advertising platform and will no longer rely on Microsoft's technology. As part of that move, Netflix announced that beginning this summer, the company will make its ad supply available to several programmatic ad partners, including Magnite and The Trade Desk, fully launching its platform in the U.S. by the second quarter of 2025.\n\nA sizable opportunity\n\nSeveral analysts have already weighed in on the deal. Benchmark notes that \"Netflix could become Magnite's largest customer by the end of 2025.\" The firm reiterated its buy rating and $18 price target, which represents potential upside of 84% compared to Wednesday's closing price. It also called Magnite a \"best idea\" for 2024.\n\nInvestment firm Craig-Hallum is even more bullish, maintaining its buy rating and boosting its price target to $20. This represents potential gains for investors of 104% compared to Wednesday's close. The analysts cited Magnite's exclusive partnership with Disney, noting that the Netflix deal represents another huge vote of confidence.\n\nHeading into the announcement, despite a rebound in the advertising market, Magnite shares were actually down 8% over the past year. A combination of slow revenue growth and lack of profits have weighed on the stock, but Wall Street and investors alike are viewing this announcement as a turning point for Magnite.",

      "# [My experience of owning the Nissan Magnite CVT: 11k kms done in 1+ year by Kanad Kalasur on 2024-10-12](https://www.team-bhp.com/news/my-experience-owning-nissan-magnite-cvt-11k-kms-done-1-year)\nOverall, it's a no-nonsense commuter. It is middle of the ground in almost all parameters, neither too good nor too bad.\n\nBHPian vamsi.vadrevu recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\n\nQuote from BHPian Ad_J:\n\nI would appreciate it if you could briefly share the experience of owning the Magnite CVT.\n\nIn the past 1 year and 3 months, I've driven 11,000km and had one free inspection and a free service.\n\nI've been getting around 10kmpl in the city and 15 or above on highways.\n\nThe CVT has been a great convenience in Hyderabad traffic.\n\nOn Highways, I've done 6 relatively long trips of about 400km in each direction.\n\nQuote from BHPian Ad_J:\n\nHow is the experience of CVT on hills, fuel efficiency, reliability etc.?\n\nOn the hills the CVT never rolls back (due to hill start assist). It holds the vehicle in place for at least 3 seconds and then starts to slowly slip the brakes. This works in both forward and backwards direction (when you're reversing). For this you need to be in gear (either D for upward inclines and R for reverse inclines).\n\nThere's sufficient torque from the engine and the CVT combo that you don't need to press the accelerator much for getting the vehicle going (even with a loaded vehicle). On inclines you'd have to press the throttle a little bit. It is very predictable and almost effortless. The shifts are smooth and imperceptible at city speeds and start to mimic normal automatics when you press down on the throttle. Kickdown takes about a second and then the turbo spools and pushes you back in the seat. However, that delay will prevent you from closing smaller gaps in traffic. I observed my own driving style change drastically when I started driving my Magnite. I was using my father's Alto K10 (from 2013 till 2023) which is so nimble and zippy in traffic that it eggs you on to close all the gaps in the traffic. I now drive very sedately. Magnite is not an enthusiast's car. But it has enough torque to safely navigate any kind of traffic or terrain scenarios. Very practical and comfortable (just not very exciting).\n\nAs for reliability, I've not had any issues with the vehicle not starting or stalling or anything out of the ordinary. It always cranked on first push of the button. I routinely check fluid levels (engine oil, coolant, brake fluid and even top up the wiper washer fluid. I also diligently check tire pressures before a every drive and maintain exactly 36 PSI as recommended. I always get my wheels aligned and balanced every 5000km too).\n\nService experience leaves something to be desired. I believe this vehicle doesn't need much service to begin with.\n\nIn the first free inspection, they merely tightened the front sub-frame bolts, checked the brakes (sanded them because I complained about brake noise when starting from cold condition) and washed the car. It took them 6 hours to do just these.\n\nThe first free service was again merely oil change, oil filter, cabin filter wheel alignment and balancing. They didn't have engine air intake filter in their service bulletin but I got it changed at my expense because it was Rs. 500 and I wanted the insides of my engine clean. The coolant replacement was at 40k as per that bulletin. There's no mention of CVT fluid change on their bulletin but I intend to get one at 15,000km just to be on the safe side. Jatco CVT JF015E that is used in Magnite likes the insides of it's transmission box very clean.\n\nhttps://akppro.ru/en/magazine/article/jatco-jf015e.html\n\nQuote from BHPian Ad_J:\n\nI have also heard that palstic used on the inside is a bit low on quality, so have you been facing any rattling issues?\n\nThe plastics are scratchy plastics and do seem to be of lower quality but they haven't faded or gotten harder. They flex a bit under pressure but that's about it. They are also easy to gouge. I accidentally ran my hand through the steering wheel to clean the instrument cluster screen while wearing a ring and it left a deep scratch on the top of my horn pad.\n\nI've not faced any major rattles. I sometimes do hear the driver side door window seal slightly rattling on rough roads. This goes away when the window is slightly down. I don't even notice it most of the time. The quality of plastics and switchgear could definitely have been better. This facelift promises to fix that. They're functional but not very appealing or aspirational.\n\nMost of the rattles that other people reported were probably because they got the Bose speakers installed from the service centers. These service center folk handle your car as if it's a piece of garbage. They tear out the transparent film (vapor barrier) that prevents water and dust from entering those areas. Removing it causes rattles apparently. So I didn't get any speakers installed.\n\nQuote from BHPian Ad_J:\n\nAlso, if you could please shed some more light on NVH, suspension and ride quality on bad roads?\n\nAt highway speeds (about 120kph on Hyderabad Outer Ring Road), I can hear a constant drone or rush of sound (that's the tire and wind noise).\n\nBelow 80kph, the noise is considerably low. You can keep up conversations with the co-passengers without any problem. (My frame of reference is the Alto K10 where sound insulation is non-existent, so my standards for NVH are very low )\n\nSuspension is a little on the hard side, but I've observed that it became softer after about 9000km. It doesn't have that firm edge anymore. Either the shocks lost their strength or the springs settled into their normal operating tension, I'm not sure. I've been maintaining the same recommended air pressure of 36 PSI so that's not a factor in comfort.\n\nI find my father's Alto K10 to have a more compliant suspension. Over rough roads and broken patches, Magnite's suspension definitely feels a lot stiffer than Alto K10s. I find myself going a lot slower in Magnite over the same roads as compared to Alto K10. The K10 simply doesn't let as many shocks through into the cabin. This is probably because Magnite is higher up from the ground and requires stiffer suspension to be able to have decent enough handling without body roll (a sad compromise of having a raised up hatchback).\n\nOn uneven or unpaved and dug up roads, Magnite wallows and sways side to side like a Volvo bus (as per my co-passengers). The seats do hold you but not as tightly as the Alto K10s. You don't sit into the car seats. You rather sit on the seats. Seats could have been deeper or had better side bolstering to prevent this side to side sway. But seats are definitely a lot more comfortable than Alto K10.\n\nAt highways speeds, the vehicle is very stable and tracks straight with very little steering inputs. It's an effortless highway vehicle and definitely not as tiring as Alto K10 (on which I did the same stretches and was tired at the end of those 400km).\n\nOverall, it's a no-nonsense commuter. It is middle of the ground in almost all parameters, neither too good nor too bad.\n\nI personally would have liked a bit more power and a bit quicker reacting vehicle but that's just my personal preference after having driven the Alto K10 for 10 years. I probably would have been a lot more happy with a Honda City manual. But these are fleeting thoughts that quickly vanish as soon as I hit a heavy traffic stretch on my commute to the office in rush hour or when I encounter an entirely dug up stretch of road with such horrid condition that would make a Thar owner think twice about navigating those stretches.\n\nSorry if the writeup wasn't brief.",

      "# [Nissan Magnite facelift launch on Oct 4: What to expect? by Express Drives Desk on 2024-09-12](https://www.financialexpress.com/auto/car-news/nissan-magnite-facelift-launch-on-oct-4-what-to-expect/3608979/)\nNissan has largely been dormant in the Indian market for a long time with just a single mass market product in the form of Magnite until the X-Trail arrived in India as a CBU model a couple of months earlier. However, at the launch of X-Trail, the Japanese market is looking to revive its business in India with multiple new launches in the pipeline.\n\nOut of the many launches planned by Nissan in the next couple of years, one of the most prominent launches is the updated Magnite slated to happen sometime later this year. We can now confirm that Nissan will be launching the Magnite facelift on October 4 this year. This will be the first major update for the subcompact SUV ever since it was first launched in late 2020.\n\nNissan Magnite facelift: What to expect?\n\nTest mules of the facelifted Nissan Magnite were spotted multiple times a few months ago although not much could be deduced from those prototypes since they were heavily camouflaged. However, we could comprehend a few visual changes on its exterior. These include reprofiled front and rear bumpers, restyled front grille, and new alloy wheels.\n\nWe expect interiors also to remain largely unchanged with possible changes including larger touchscreen infotainment and digital instrument cluster with better graphics. Other key highlights expected to be part of the package are an advanced PM2.5 air filter, rear AC vents, auto-dimming IRVM, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, wireless smartphone charger, keyless entry, a JBL audio system, ambient lighting, and puddle lamp.\n\nThe sub-4 metre crossover is also expected to benefit from six airbags across the entire range apart from ABS with EBD, and rear parking sensors. Additional safety features expected to be offered include hill start assist, vehicle dynamic control, 360-degree camera, traction control system and tyre pressure monitoring system.\n\nNissan Magnite facelift: Powertrain specs\n\nPowering the Nissan Magnite facelift will be the same 1.0-litre NA petrol and a 1.0-litre turbo petrol engine.The former pushes out 71 bhp and 96 Nm of peak torque while the latter pumps out 99 bhp and 160 Nm (152 Nm of AT). Both engine options are paired to a 5-speed gearbox as standard with the option of an AMT in both.\n\nCurrently offered at a starting price of Rs 5.99 lakh (ex-showroom), we expect a minor bump in prices for the Magnite facelift.",

    "# Comprehensive Analyst Report on Magnite, Inc. (MGNI)\n\n## Company Overview\nMagnite, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGNI) is recognized as the world's largest independent sell-side advertising company. The company provides technology that enables publishers to monetize their content across various formats, including Connected TV (CTV), online video, display, and audio. With a market capitalization of approximately $1.89 billion, Magnite operates globally, with offices in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, London, and Singapore [(iHeartMedia, 2024)](https://investors.iheartmedia.com/news/news-details/2024/iHeartMedia-and-Magnite-Unify-Access-to-Broadcast-and-Digital-AudioProviding-Advertisers-with-a-Direct-Path-to-Premium-Inventory/default.aspx).\n\n## Financial Performance\nMagnite's financial results for the second quarter of 2024 showed a revenue increase of 7% year-over-year, totaling $162.9 million. The company's contribution ex-TAC (Traffic Acquisition Cost) grew by 9% to $146.8 million, with CTV revenue specifically increasing by 12% to $63 million [(Magnite, 2024)](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/MGNI/magnite-reports-second-quarter-2024-7lm1fumn92pc.html). Despite these gains, the company reported a net loss of $1.1 million, a significant improvement from a loss of $73.9 million in the same quarter the previous year [(Magnite, 2024)](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/MGNI/magnite-reports-second-quarter-2024-7lm1fumn92pc.html).\n\n## Recent Developments\n### Partnerships and Collaborations\nMagnite has been actively expanding its partnerships to enhance its programmatic advertising capabilities. Notably, the company entered into an exclusive partnership with TargetSmart to facilitate data-driven political advertising across CTV inventory [(Magnite, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/news/). Additionally, Magnite was selected as the preferred technology partner for TELUS Communications, leveraging its SpringServe ad server and Streaming SSP to enhance advertising opportunities in Canada [(TELUS, 2024)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magnite-chosen-as-the-preferred-technology-partner-to-enhance-telus-connected-tv-offering-302191700.html).\n\n### Strategic Acquisitions\nIn September 2024, Magnite successfully completed a term loan repricing, reducing its interest rate by 75 basis points, which is expected to save the company over $2.7 million annually in interest payments [(Magnite, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/news/).\n\n### Product Innovations\nMagnite has introduced several innovations, including the Demand Manager tool, which automates Prebid wrapper optimization, enhancing the efficiency of programmatic advertising for publishers [(Vargas, 2024)](https://www.adexchanger.com/publishers/magnite-tackles-fully-automated-prebid-wrapper-optimization/). The company is also focusing on expanding its CTV offerings, with a recent partnership with Netflix expected to significantly boost its CTV revenue stream [(Vargas, 2024)](https://www.adexchanger.com/tv/magnite-continues-steady-growth-powered-by-programmatic-ctv/).\n\n## Market Position and Challenges\nDespite its growth, Magnite faces challenges in a competitive advertising landscape. Analysts have noted that the company is perceived as one of the \"worst advertising stocks\" by short sellers, indicating a level of skepticism regarding its future performance [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MGNI/news/). However, the company has shown resilience, with a stock price increase of 81.1% over the past nine months, reflecting investor optimism following strategic partnerships and product innovations [(StockNews.com, 2024)](https://stocknews.com/news/mgni-nexn-crto-tbla-is-magnite-a-top-pick-in-digital-advertising/).\n\n## Executive Insights\nMichael G. Barrett, President and CEO of Magnite, expressed optimism about the company's future, stating, \"A positive ad spend environment to start 2024, plus our share gains, have led to a great start to the year, and we remain optimistic this momentum will continue\" [(StockNews.com, 2024)](https://stocknews.com/news/mgni-nexn-crto-tbla-is-magnite-a-top-pick-in-digital-advertising/). This sentiment is echoed by analysts who see potential for growth, particularly in the CTV segment, which is expected to continue expanding as programmatic adoption increases [(Vargas, 2024)](https://www.adexchanger.com/tv/magnite-continues-steady-growth-powered-by-programmatic-ctv/).\n\n## Conclusion\nMagnite, Inc. is positioned as a leader in the independent sell-side advertising space, with a strong focus on programmatic solutions and strategic partnerships. While the company faces challenges in a competitive market, its recent financial performance and innovative product offerings suggest a positive trajectory. Prospective candidates and investors should consider the company's growth potential, particularly in the CTV sector, while remaining aware of the inherent risks associated with the advertising technology industry. \n\nFor further details, please refer to the sources cited throughout this report."
