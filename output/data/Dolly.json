Taskrabbit and our Third Party Agents may disclose your Personal Information or User Generated Content to courts, law enforcement, governmental or public authorities, tax authorities or authorised third parties, if and to the extent required or permitted to do so by law or where disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with Taskrabbit’s legal or regulatory obligations; (ii) respond to a court order, warrant or subpoena; (iii) respond to a valid legal request relating to an investigation into alleged criminal or illegal activity; or (iv) respond to or address any other activity that may expose us to legal or regulatory liability.\n\ninformation about Users’ permits, licenses, tax, or social security registrations, Taskrabbit and our Third Party Agents may disclose information, including but not limited to, User contact details, identification information, transaction dates and amounts, license and permit status, and tax identification number(s) to applicable governmental authorities.\n\nTaskrabbit reserves the right to disclose Personal Information from both private and public areas of the Taskrabbit Platform in the absence of a court order, warrant, or subpoena, to the extent permitted by applicable law, if we are given reason to believe, in our sole discretion, that someone is causing injury to or interfering with the rights of Users, the general public, or Taskrabbit or its partners, parents or affiliates.\n\nIt is our policy to provide notice to Users before producing their information in response to law enforcement requests unless (i) we are prohibited or otherwise constrained by law or court order from doing so, (ii) we have reason to believe the User’s account has been compromised such that the notice would go to the wrong person, or notice would otherwise be counterproductive or would create a risk to safety, or (iii) it is an emergency request and prior notice would be impractical (in which case we may provide notice after the fact).\n\nMerger or Acquisition. Taskrabbit reserves the right to share information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale, or any other type of acquisition or business combination of all or any portion of our assets, or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another business.\n\nPublic Areas. Your profile on the Taskrabbit Platform consists of information about you and your business, and may include information such as photographs, your years in business, skills and expertise, hourly pay rates, feedback/rating information, and other information, including your username (“Profile”).

There, you can view, update, and correct your Account information.\n\nSo that we may protect the integrity of the Taskrabbit Platform, there are certain pieces of information, such as your age, that you cannot alter yourself. For example, since children under the age of majority in their jurisdiction of residence are not allowed to register as Users, we need to take reasonable measures to preserve the accuracy of our Users' ages. You may contact us at [email protected] if there is a need to make a correction to such data. Please see Section 11, Children’s Privacy, for more details.\n\nPromotional Communications.

Taskrabbit's Information Retention Policy\n\nWe retain personal data for as long as you are a User in order to meet our contractual obligations to you, and for such longer period as may be in our legitimate interests and to comply with our legal obligations (see Exhibit A for exemplar document retention periods). We may also retain data from which you cannot directly be identified, for example where stored against a randomly-generated identifier so we know the data relates to a single User, but we cannot tell who that User is. We use this kind of data for research purposes and to help us develop and improve our services, and we take appropriate measures to ensure you cannot be re-identified from this data.\n\n9. Taskrabbit’s Security of Collected Information\n\nYour Taskrabbit account is password-protected so that only you and authorized Taskrabbit staff have access to your account information. In order to maintain this protection, do not give your password to anyone. Also, if you share a computer, you should sign out of your Taskrabbit account and close the browser window before someone else logs on. This will help protect your information entered on public terminals from disclosure to third parties.\n\nTaskrabbit implements and maintains reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security safeguards to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Taskrabbit has staff dedicated to maintaining this Privacy Policy and other privacy initiatives, periodically reviewing security, and making sure that every Taskrabbit employee is aware of our security practices. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of information about you.\n\n10. Notification of Changes\n\nTaskrabbit's Privacy Policy is periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. This Privacy Policy might change as Taskrabbit updates and expands the Taskrabbit Platform. Taskrabbit will endeavor to notify you of any material changes by email. Taskrabbit also encourages you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.\n\n11.

THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION WILL APPLY ONLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE UNDER LAWS APPLICABLE TO YOU (INCLUDING WHERE RELEVANT THE APPLICABLE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS).\n\nIndemnification\n\nYou will defend us from and against any actual or threatened suits, actions, proceedings (at law or in equity), and claims, and indemnify us for any and all damages, payments, deficiencies, fines, judgments, settlements, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, penalties, interest, and disbursements) arising from or related to any of your Requests and your conduct with respect to the Dolly Platform, requesting or obtaining Services, or your violation (or alleged violation) of these Terms or the rights of any third party by you or any person using your Dolly account.\n\nThird Party Software\n\nThe software you may download (if relevant) consists of a package of components, including certain third party software provided under separate third party license terms. Your use of this third party software in conjunction with the App in a manner consistent with the terms of these Terms is permitted, however, you may have broader rights under the applicable third-party license terms, and nothing in these Terms is intended to impose further restrictions on your use of this third-party software.\n\nChanges to the Dolly Platform\n\nDolly reserves the right in our discretion to review, improve, change or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Sites, the App, components of the Dolly Platform and/or any features, information, materials or content available on the Dolly Platform with or without providing notice to you. Dolly will not be liable to you or any third party for any changes or discontinuance of the Sites, the App, the Dolly Platform (or any part of the Dolly Platform) and/or any features, information, materials or content available on the Dolly Platform.\n\nConsent to Electronic Communications\n\nBy using the Dolly Platform, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding your use of the Dolly Platform and that any notices, agreements, disclosures or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that the communications be in writing. To withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice, please notify us at [email protected].\n\nSuspension and Termination\n\nDolly may suspend or terminate your rights to access or use any and all aspects of the Dolly Platform (including the App) for any reason or for no reason at all and with or without notice at Dolly's discretion. All of the terms of these Terms (excluding the license grant) will survive any termination or suspension.\n\nGoverning Law; Arbitration\n\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH DOLLY AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM DOLLY.\n\nThese Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington and the United States of America, without resort to any conflict of law provisions.\n\nIn the event of any controversy or claim between the Parties, arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms and the subject matter covered by these Terms, you and Dolly agree to consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing your mutual interests, try to reach a solution satisfactory to both parties. If we do not reach settlement within a period of 60 days, then either of us may, by notice to the other demand mediation under the mediation rules of the American Arbitration Association in Seattle, Washington. We both give up our right to litigate our disputes and may not proceed to arbitration without first trying mediation, but you and Dolly are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief from the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Dolly will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.\n\nIf settlement is not reached within 60 days after service of a written demand for mediation, any unresolved controversy or claim will be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association before a single arbitrator in Seattle, Washington. The language of all proceedings and filings will be English. The arbitrator will render a written opinion including findings of fact and law and the award and/or determination of the arbitrator will be binding on the parties, and their respective administrators and assigns, and will not be subject to appeal. Judgment may be entered upon the award of the arbitrator in any court of competent jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration will be shared equally by the parties unless the arbitration determines that the expenses will be otherwise assessed and the prevailing party may be awarded its attorneys' fees and expenses by the arbitrator. It is the intent of the parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances, arbitration proceedings will be concluded within 90 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit only if failure to do so would unduly prejudice the rights of the parties. Failure to adhere to this time limit will not constitute a basis for challenging the award. Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, pre-hearing information exchange will be limited to the reasonable production of relevant, non-privileged documents, carried out expeditiously.\n\nFor any disputes between the Parties that are not handled by arbitration, you agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms and/or the subject matter covered by these Terms shall be filed only in the state and federal courts located in Seattle, Washington and the Parties each hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding between the Parties arising out of or relating these Terms and/or the subject matter covered by these Terms.\n\nGeneral\n\nEnforcement of these Terms is solely at Dolly's discretion. Failure to enforce any part of these Terms in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce the same or other part of these Terms in other instances.\n\nIf any provision of these Terms is or becomes unlawful, void or otherwise unenforceable (including the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations above), then that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.\n\nThe section headings of these Terms are for reference purposes only and will not affect the meaning or interpretation of these Terms.\n\nThese Terms (and terms or policies incorporated herein) make up the entire agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter covered herein, including access and use of Dolly Platform, Requests, and the Services, and they supersede any other terms, whether implied or expressed.\n\nContact Us\n\nIf you have any questions about these Terms, please email us at [email protected] or send a letter to:\n\nDolly, Inc.\n\n9450 SW Gemini Dr., PMB 43895\n\nBeaverton, Oregon 97008-7105\n\nNotice for California Users\n\nIf you are a California resident, you may have these Terms mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to the address above with your electronic mail address and a request for these Terms. Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California Website users are entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 1625 N. Market Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.\n\nNotice Regarding Apple\n\nApple, Inc. and Other Third-Party Beneficiaries. You acknowledge and agree that Apple, Inc. (\"Apple\") and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and further that (a) upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party; (b) these Terms are conducted between you and Dolly only, and not Apple; (c) Dolly, and not Apple, is solely responsible for the Dolly Platform and the content thereof provided by Dolly; (d) Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Dolly Platform; (e) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no warranty obligation with respect to the Dolly Platform; and Dolly, and not Apple, will be responsible for any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure of the Dolly Platform to conform to any applicable warranty; (f) in the event of any third party claim that the Dolly Platform or your possession and use of that Dolly Platform infringes that third party's intellectual property rights, Apple will not be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim; and (g) Apple will not be responsible for addressing any of your claims or any third party claims relating to the Dolly Platform or your possession and/or use of the Dolly Platform, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Dolly Platform fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.\n\nNotice Regarding Damage Protection\n\nPlease note that Damage Protection only applies to the goods being transported. It does not protect damage to the environment surrounding the Dolly (e.g. floors, walls, ceiling, etc.). Additionally, for Damage Protection and insurance purposes, the value of any given item is considered to be the lesser of (a) the price at which it was most recently purchased (last 12 months), or (b) the cost of replacement, as may be reasonably determined by Dolly. Further, the value of such an item is determined independently of the amount of any supplemental Damage Protection purchased from Dolly (in addition to the $300 of complimentary Damage Protection provided by Dolly). For example, if $1,000 of supplemental Damage Protection were purchased, the recent purchase price was $300, and the cost of replacement were $400, then Damage Protection would cover $300. Dolly reserves the right to reject any claims of damage not submitted within 14 days of the damaging incident. Dolly is not responsible for any damage that is incurred outside of the express-written parameters of the move as purchased by the customer. Any act undertaken by our independent contractors that is not explicitly paid for may not qualify for Damage Protection.",

They were supposed to show up in like 3 hours when they canceled. I was forced to find a rental truck on the busiest day of the year (July 31st).

Dalton's, these were invaluable for carrying books up the stairs. H-carts were out of the question, the stairs turned halfway up.\n\nOSHA hazards aside, as a mall bookstore, we didn't bring the H-carts out on the floor often because, well, floor space. Takes up too much room and with people walking around with food and drink, we'd have abandoned leavings all the time if we did, I'm sure. So, V-carts to the rescue, H-carts for when the store was closed or it was going to be left behind the registers and you used that as the home base while you refilled the bestsellers, or what have you, at the front of the store.\n\nGenerally you'd sort by height, first and foremost, biggest books at the bottom, usually one v-cart per section of the store. If you were doing the fiction wall, try to alphabetize it a bit first (because the fiction wall, as implied, was a whole wall that ran the length of the store). But anything else -- eh. Most other sections were relatively compact. I think sci-fi / fantasy and romance were the two largest sections next to fiction, and if I'm remembering right, they were about six, maybe eight bays each. But, three (or four?) bays on one side facing the middle aisle (the main drag, with the most open space), and the same number on the opposite side, facing the fiction wall.\n\nSo if it wasn't alphabetically sorted in advance, you weren't *too* badly off. Especially since after a while, you memorized what letter was the last one used on each section's side, so if you came across an author on the latter half of the alphabet, no big deal, leave it on the cart until you had a few for the other side.\n\nOh, and if you've only got mass markets, you can fit two columns of books, easy, three of you turned them right, or had a single large hardcover on the bottom to serve as a larger base, like that illustrated (or was it just a collector's edition?) The Da Vinci Code that came out for a while there. That book was great for stacking books on the smaller V-carts.\n\n## Comment ID in05amf with +20 score by [(Mega_Zawesome, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in05amf/) (in reply to ID x580vr):\nah yes, the humble v-cart. the good ones have the rubber on the bottom edge so you can ram it into the doors in the back\n\n## Comment ID imzzi52 with +30 score by [(theHLB, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/imzzi52/) (in reply to ID x580vr):\nThe trusty Barnes & Noble V-cart. 🙂\n\n## Comment ID in018rt with +10 score by [(Alertox, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in018rt/) (in reply to ID x580vr):\nSymmetrical book stacking…just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947.\n\n### Comment ID in0nef7 with +7 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in0nef7/) (in reply to ID in018rt):\nYou're right, no human being would stack books like this.\n\n#### Comment ID in0uqax with +2 score by [(LawDog23, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in0uqax/) (in reply to ID in0nef7):\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Wel63QwhfpU\n\n## Comment ID in11e1h with +10 score by [(tI-_-tI, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in11e1h/) (in reply to ID x580vr):\nWhen it breaks, and you order new parts, do you have to ask \"is the Dolly part in?\"\n\n### Comment ID in18vtp with +2 score by [(Nosmurfz, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in18vtp/) (in reply to ID in11e1h):\nI see what you did there\n\n#### Comment ID in2p0d4 with +2 score by [(tI-_-tI, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in2p0d4/) (in reply to ID in18vtp):\nShout out Dolly Parton's Imagination Library!  https://imaginationlibrary.com/\n\n## Comment ID in0ax8v with +8 score by [(Domestica, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in0ax8v/) (in reply to ID x580vr):\nBack when I worked at b&n, the SM liked to use these carts to stack the cash tills when transporting them from the office to the front registers.

This sounds fishy as fuck to me and I’m calling BS on it. \n\nYour DSP and its owner should have stuff like that budgeted and planned in the event equipment is lost/damaged since it happens all the time, and they should be able to cover the cost of its replacement after you run a single route seeing that Amazon pays DSPs $250/route last I checked. *Do not pay for it.* I would also highly recommend checking all your paystubs, both past and future for any discrepancies you may notice with your pay.

It's called \"the cost of doing business.\" Ur boss can write off business expenses where you cannot.\n\n### Comment ID lbtn8tu with +9 score by [(Florida_Terp, Reddit, 2024-07-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonDSPDrivers/comments/1dw920i/i_left_a_dolly_at_an_apartment_complex/lbtn8tu/) (in reply to ID lbt3vzp):\nI hope you mean $250 profit…\n\n#### Comment ID lbu5oxu with +9 score by [(TheUnshackledJester, Reddit, 2024-07-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonDSPDrivers/comments/1dw920i/i_left_a_dolly_at_an_apartment_complex/lbu5oxu/) (in reply to ID lbtn8tu):\nNah $250 seems a bit low, but not by much. I'm fairly certain they get paid by the hour(s) on the routes...but the real \"money\" is hidden in the contract bonuses. This is why the DSP's are constantly hitting the DA's up for \"fantastic/fantastic+\" on their scorecards. The DSP rating fair vs fantastic vs fantastic+ is literally the difference of thousands of dollars a week in bonuses. Amazon puts them over the barrel on following their dumbass requirements by tying the actual \"profit\" into those scorecard results. It is intentional and scummy as fuck given how fucking stupid most of the scorecard requirements can be.\n\n  \nThis is also why a bunch of DSP's tie \"bonus pay\" into your score. If you do really well, it makes them more money... so they pass some of it along hoping that you'll keep chasing that to make them more money.\n\n#### Comment ID lbtuekr with +4 score by [(WesternExplanation, Reddit, 2024-07-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonDSPDrivers/comments/1dw920i/i_left_a_dolly_at_an_apartment_complex/lbtuekr/) (in reply to ID lbtn8tu):\nDsps really don’t make much money.

I used to be a dispatcher and all my DSP offered was those bullshit plastic fold up dollys that can't even hold 20 pounds without falling over.

I'm not gonna lie, I did think employees that lost or stole them should have been responsible for paying for them. That was an investment that my boss was really hesitant to let me make and as much as I think he's a scam artist, turns out he was right. That said, you can't make employees pay for lost or damaged property, even if they did ruin a good thing I was trying to do for all of us in less than a week.

If they keep pushing it find a new job and a lawyer. \n\nFile a lawsuit once you get a new job with the evidence you have. You'll get a nice little 50k payback for their illigal bull.\n\n## Comment ID lc25b3n with +1 score by [(Ok_Championship_5428, Reddit, 2024-07-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonDSPDrivers/comments/1dw920i/i_left_a_dolly_at_an_apartment_complex/lc25b3n/) (in reply to ID 1dw920i):\nIt's illegal to charge a worker for company property loss or damage.

They'll take care of you and give you mutual respect and appreciation for your work. And if you're working hard, they're working hard right beside you, putting in the long hours and going the extra mile to make things happen.\r\n- The team culture is tight-knit and caring. Everyone cares about not just your work performance, but your personal happiness, and will go out of their way to make sure you're happy in all aspects of your life. One of the leaders even did a full presentation on investing for anyone who was interested because me and another employee didn't fully understand some of the terminology around our stock.\r\n- Lots of opportunities to influence &amp; change the company, and higher-ups are always happy to listen to new ideas\r\n- Diverse team that's always working to become more diverse when hiring\r\n- Weekly standups covering KPIs across all teams, so you know what people are working on and you always know how the company is progressing\r\n- Other teams are always open to your input and suggestions, and no idea is too far-fetched to be heard out\r\n- Opportunities to work on high-level projects no matter your level. My first week as an entry-level employee, the CEO gave me a serious research project to work on for him specifically. There's a level of trust working here that most companies never achieve.\r\n- If there's a problem (whether it's with the app or culture), the team seeks not just to quick fix it, but to figure out what caused it in the first place.",

The overall attitude towards Operations &amp; Support (customer success), from a company-wide level, needs to change. One of your founders regularly bad mouths them as second class employees. \r\n\r\nIf you start respecting your people they will go to war for you. Compensate them properly so they don't have to stay at home to work, because they literally cant afford bus fare. On that note, probably best with a downtown office to provide some sort of commuter pass help, which almost every single company downtown provides. \r\n\r\nIt is possible to improve, but Leadership and management would all need to take a hard look in the mirror and see that they are the cause of many issues. Realize that people who get treated well by companies as employees, work harder and stick around. When employees for the Operations department are regularly surfacing that they feel grossly under compensated, LISTEN. The reasoning that \"its within low market average\" doesn't cut it if there is a complete department turnover in 6 months. \r\n\r\nIf you were compensating properly, respecting your employees, and honoring  work/life balance, would everyone be leaving at such a high rate? (100% of Support/Customer Success Agents left from 6 months ago) \r\n\r\nDolly is an amazing idea but my experience with management soured me so much, it is hard for me to root for them as a company.",

          "cons": "Compensation for all Operations positions are grossly under market value. Feedback from Management is that there is no more money in the budget for raises. This is a very hard pill to swallow when you work more than 50+ hours per week, and then find out that many other departments employees are making 2X your salary, and not even working 40 hours a week. \r\n\r\nDon't plan on holidays and weekends being off limits for a Manager non-stop texting you about work, or to get on your laptop because that Manager cannot properly hire, staff-out, train, nor retain Support Agents for their team. There was more than one occurrence where I had to repeatedly ask this manager to stop texting me about work, because I was with my family on Thanksgiving. This was a regular occurrence during weekends.  I have worked for a number of startups in various stages, the team at Dolly will tell you this is normal....it is not. \r\n\r\nIf you do get promoted up the very short ladder available, more and more will be asked of you, which is great until you realize that you're doing multiple jobs responsibilities and not getting anywhere near compensated for your time and work. \r\n\r\nUnlimited PTO is completely false for the Operations team. In my experience, I was flat out denied a vacation which was for a friends wedding. I was also made to come in on a day requested off. These kind of things do not happen at companies that value people and their lives outside of work.",

If you're hired at an hourly role for the support roles, you start at less than minimum wage (because they are a startup they don't need to match this yet), and are told that eventually you may be able to transition into a salaried position with full benefits. This won't be the case until you serve at least 2 years and meet every requirement. Given the current track record, you'll either quit or get let go before you get there. \r\n\r\nBe prepared to work anytime between 5AM and 9PM, any day of the week including (and especially) Saturdays/Sundays. An email/text from management at odd hours expecting a response on days off is not uncommon.\r\n\r\nIn the Ops team, the expectations to work harder and smarter than anyone else, while being underpaid and also being responsible for any shortcomings will take a toll on your mental health. \r\n\r\nThe Customer \"Success\" team is expected to be working non-stop by urgently handling every request that comes in the help desk via phone calls, emails, text messages,  etc. Being on the phone for 4+ hours a day is not uncommon, most of which is spent dealing with highly stressful situations and unpleasant customers and contractors that work for the company.\r\n\r\nManagement is not shy of publicly shaming any shortcomings, but is conservative when providing any praise or incentives to keep up the work. \r\n\r\nParking for the building is $200/mo, and there is no program to reimburse you for your transit costs. Even if you're working on an hourly rate of $14 in one of the most expensive cities in the country. The cost of getting to and from work will essentially mean you work at least 15 hours to cover your bus fares for the month.\r\n\r\nFor a being a technology company that started off with a mobile app, it's incredibly frustrating to see that the app is still plagued with issues. Customers and contractors that work for the company in the field will report and complain about app problems every day but with the entire app team consisting of 1 or 2 developers( without a product manager), it is crippling the progress of the company. The unfortunate truth is that these developers are spending the vast majority of their time troubleshooting and bug fixing rather than releasing new features.\r\n\r\nBusiness development forges new partnerships with stores in markets all the time, but does not take into account how the customers that shop at these stores fit the persona for the company. Having to make \"one-time exceptions\" all the time, and ultimately have to provide a negative experience due to customer expectations is not worth it. \r\n\r\nBottom line, there are false promises being made all around. The company has an excellent product idea, and solves a real problem. However, the entire focus is around the customers (who have zero brand loyalty) rather than the employees and the contractors that are actually providing the service. \r\n\r\nA bad apple here or there is excusable. But when there have been over 10 employees that have either quit or been let go for the same management reasons, it serves to show there is a common denominator that poor leadership is causing the company to suffer and prevent healthy growth.",

If you're hired at an hourly role for the support roles, you start at less than minimum wage (because they are a startup they don't need to match this yet), and are told that eventually you may be able to transition into a salaried position with full benefits. This won't be the case until you serve at least 2 years and meet every requirement. Given the current track record, you'll either quit or get let go before you get there. \r\n\r\nBe prepared to work anytime between 5AM and 9PM, any day of the week including (and especially) Saturdays/Sundays. An email/text from management at odd hours expecting a response on days off is not uncommon.\r\n\r\nIn the Ops team, the expectations to work harder and smarter than anyone else, while being underpaid and also being responsible for any shortcomings will take a toll on your mental health. \r\n\r\nThe Customer \"Success\" team is expected to be working non-stop by urgently handling every request that comes in the help desk via phone calls, emails, text messages,  etc. Being on the phone for 4+ hours a day is not uncommon, most of which is spent dealing with highly stressful situations and unpleasant customers and contractors that work for the company.\r\n\r\nManagement is not shy of publicly shaming any shortcomings, but is conservative when providing any praise or incentives to keep up the work. \r\n\r\nParking for the building is $200/mo, and there is no program to reimburse you for your transit costs. Even if you're working on an hourly rate of $14 in one of the most expensive cities in the country. The cost of getting to and from work will essentially mean you work at least 15 hours to cover your bus fares for the month.\r\n\r\nFor a being a technology company that started off with a mobile app, it's incredibly frustrating to see that the app is still plagued with issues. Customers and contractors that work for the company in the field will report and complain about app problems every day but with the entire app team consisting of 1 or 2 developers( without a product manager), it is crippling the progress of the company. The unfortunate truth is that these developers are spending the vast majority of their time troubleshooting and bug fixing rather than releasing new features.\r\n\r\nBusiness development forges new partnerships with stores in markets all the time, but does not take into account how the customers that shop at these stores fit the persona for the company. Having to make \"one-time exceptions\" all the time, and ultimately have to provide a negative experience due to customer expectations is not worth it. \r\n\r\nBottom line, there are false promises being made all around. The company has an excellent product idea, and solves a real problem. However, the entire focus is around the customers (who have zero brand loyalty) rather than the employees and the contractors that are actually providing the service. \r\n\r\nA bad apple here or there is excusable. But when there have been over 10 employees that have either quit or been let go for the same management reasons, it serves to show there is a common denominator that poor leadership is causing the company to suffer and prevent healthy growth.",

On that note, probably best with a downtown office to provide some sort of commuter pass help, which almost every single company downtown provides. \r\n\r\nIt is possible to improve, but Leadership and management would all need to take a hard look in the mirror and see that they are the cause of many issues. Realize that people who get treated well by companies as employees, work harder and stick around. When employees for the Operations department are regularly surfacing that they feel grossly under compensated, LISTEN. The reasoning that \"its within low market average\" doesn't cut it if there is a complete department turnover in 6 months. \r\n\r\nIf you were compensating properly, respecting your employees, and honoring  work/life balance, would everyone be leaving at such a high rate? (100% of Support/Customer Success Agents left from 6 months ago) \r\n\r\nDolly is an amazing idea but my experience with management soured me so much, it is hard for me to root for them as a company.",
        "cons": "Compensation for all Operations positions are grossly under market value. Feedback from Management is that there is no more money in the budget for raises. This is a very hard pill to swallow when you work more than 50+ hours per week, and then find out that many other departments employees are making 2X your salary, and not even working 40 hours a week. \r\n\r\nDon't plan on holidays and weekends being off limits for a Manager non-stop texting you about work, or to get on your laptop because that Manager cannot properly hire, staff-out, train, nor retain Support Agents for their team. There was more than one occurrence where I had to repeatedly ask this manager to stop texting me about work, because I was with my family on Thanksgiving. This was a regular occurrence during weekends.  I have worked for a number of startups in various stages, the team at Dolly will tell you this is normal....it is not. \r\n\r\nIf you do get promoted up the very short ladder available, more and more will be asked of you, which is great until you realize that you're doing multiple jobs responsibilities and not getting anywhere near compensated for your time and work. \r\n\r\nUnlimited PTO is completely false for the Operations team. In my experience, I was flat out denied a vacation which was for a friends wedding. I was also made to come in on a day requested off. These kind of things do not happen at companies that value people and their lives outside of work.",

One of the leaders even did a full presentation on investing for anyone who was interested because me and another employee didn't fully understand some of the terminology around our stock.\r\n- Lots of opportunities to influence &amp; change the company, and higher-ups are always happy to listen to new ideas\r\n- Diverse team that's always working to become more diverse when hiring\r\n- Weekly standups covering KPIs across all teams, so you know what people are working on and you always know how the company is progressing\r\n- Other teams are always open to your input and suggestions, and no idea is too far-fetched to be heard out\r\n- Opportunities to work on high-level projects no matter your level.

I can't stand to see anyone hurting, so I wanted to do what I could to help after these terrible floods.\"\n\nThe country music icon was born in Locust Ridge, Tennessee to a poor family living deep in rural Appalachia — and Parton has often written about her childhood and the region in her songs, including hits such as \"Smoky Mountain Memories\" and \"My Tennessee Mountain Home.\"\n\nShe was joined by Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner, who said the company, including Sam's Club and the Walmart Foundation, would donate a total of $10 million to hurricane relief efforts across the affected states. Parton's associated businesses, including Dollywood Parks & Resorts and The Dollywood Foundation, also announced they would match Parton's donation with another $1 million to the Mountain Ways Foundation.\n\nAt least 225 people have been confirmed dead after Helene swept through the Southeast, and officials say they expect the death toll to rise as recovery efforts continue. Satellite images showed large areas of North Carolina devastated by the storm. President Biden said Friday the work to rebuild the damage will cost \"billions of dollars.\"\n\nParton said she hopes her donations will inspire others to donate and assist in the massive recovery efforts.\n\n\"I hope we can all be a little bit of light in the world for our friends, our neighbors — even strangers — during this dark time they are experiencing.\"",
      "# [‘Pride and Prejudice’ Series in Development at Netflix From Dolly Alderton by Ellise Shafer on 2024-10-11](https://variety.com/2024/tv/global/pride-and-prejudice-series-netflix-dolly-alderton-1236175416/)\nA series based on Jane Austen’s “Pride and Prejudice” is in development at Netflix, with “Everything I Know About Love” author Dolly Alderton penning the scripts.\n\nThere is no cast attached yet and the project has not been greenlit at the streamer. Netflix has a history with Austen, having adapted “Persuasion” for a 2022 movie starring Dakota Johnson.\n\nAusten’s most famous novel, “Pride and Prejudice” follows the intelligent yet stubborn Elizabeth Bennet as she learns that love is more powerful than pride or prejudice through her relationship with Mr. Darcy, a man she initially dislikes but eventually falls for. The book, originally published in 1813, has been adapted several times for screen, perhaps most famously in the 2005 film starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen (pictured above) and the BBC’s 1995 miniseries with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.\n\nAlderton is best known for her bestselling 2018 memoir “Everything I Know About Love,” which looks back on her experience navigating her 20s and has become somewhat of a bible for Millennial and Gen Z women. It was adapted into a seven-episode series by Alderton for BBC One and Peacock in 2022. Alderton’s most recent book, “Good Material” — a fictional novel following a struggling male comedian in the fallout of a breakup — released last year to positive reviews.\n\nIt’s been a big week for Austen on screen — on Wednesday, the BBC announced a “Pride and Prejudice” spinoff series about Elizabeth Bennet’s sister, Mary. Titled “The Other Bennet Sister,” the series is being made by “Doctor Who” producer Bad Wolf.\n\nNetflix declined to comment. A representative for Alderton did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment.",
      "# [Dolly Parton developing Broadway musical based on her life story by Cara Tabachnick on 2024-06-06](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dolly-parton-broadway-musical-hello-im-dolly/)\nDolly Parton is bringing her life story to the Broadway stage, the country legend announced on social media Thursday.\n\n\"I've been writing my life story as a Broadway musical for several years and I'm proud to announce we are finally developing 'Hello, I'm Dolly - An Original Musical' for the Broadway stage,\" Parton said. Inspired by her life and career, \"Hello, I'm Dolly\" will come to Broadway in 2026 with music and lyrics by Parton, a statement on the show's website said.\n\nAlthough the icon has been in the public eye for decades, this will be the first musical produced about her life. The singer announced during the CMA Fest in Nashville that the show will have \"many original songs\" and that she's included all the fan favorites in the score. \"You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll clap, you'll stomp, it truly is a Grand Ol' Opera. Pun and fun intended. Don't miss it,\" Parton said.\n\nParton, 78, shows no signs of slowing down. Last year she garnered three new Guinness World Records for her musical achievements, bringing her total to 10 world records. Her awards include the record for the longest span of No.1 hits for a female artist on the U.S. Top Country Albums chart, covering more than 43 years, and most studio albums released by a female country singer.",

      "# [Dolly Parton is sending free books to children across 21 states — and around the world by HEATHER HOLLINGSWORTH, BRUCE SCHREINER on 2024-08-27](https://apnews.com/article/dolly-parton-children-books-states-program-5aa502c1905babd9604e9b3588942995)\nDolly Parton’s father grew up poor and never got the chance to learn to read.\n\nInspired by her upbringing, the 78-year-old country music legend has made it her mission over the past three decades to improve literacy through her Imagination Library book giveaway program. It has expanded statewide in places like Missouri and Kentucky, two of 21 states where all children under the age of 5 can enroll to have books mailed to their homes monthly.\n\nTo celebrate, she made stops Tuesday in both states to promote the program and tell the story of her father, Robert Lee Parton, who died in 2000.\n\n“In the mountains, a lot of people never had a chance to go to school because they had to work on the farms,” she said at the Folly Theater in Kansas City, Missouri. “They had to do whatever it took to keep the rest of the family going.”\n\nParton, the fourth of 12 children from a poor Appalachian family, said her father was “one of the smartest people I’ve ever known,” but he was embarrassed that he couldn’t read.\n\nAnd so she decided to help other kids, initially rolling out the program in a single county in her home state of Tennessee in 1995. It spread quickly from there, and today over 3 million books are sent out each month. Since the program started, books have been sent to more than 240 million to kids in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia.\n\nMissouri covers the full cost of the program, which totaled $11 million in the latest fiscal year. Most of the other states chip in money through a cost-sharing model.\n\n“The kids started calling me the ‘book lady,’” Parton said. “And Daddy was more proud of that than he was that I was a star. But Daddy got to feeling like he had really done something great as well.”\n\nIn Kentucky, the Imagination Library reaches children in all 120 counties, Gov. Andy Beshear said at an event Tuesday with Parton. More than 120,000 Kentucky children — nearly half of all preschoolers in the state — are currently enrolled to receive books through the program, first lady Britainy Beshear said.\n\nIt encourages families to read together, and it allows children to have their own personal library before starting kindergarten, at no cost to their families, the first lady said.\n\n“It’s really a great way to teach children when they’re very young to learn to love books and to learn to read,” Parton said during the event in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nParton, who earned the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award a decade ago, said she eventually wants to see the program in every state. While there is a presence in all of them, 21 have legislation ensuring all kids under 5 can enroll. She said she is proud that her dad lived long enough to see the program get off the ground.\n\n“That was kind of my way to honor my dad, because the Bible says to honor your father and mother,” she said. “And I don’t think that just means, ‘just obey.’ I think it means to bring honor to their name and to them.”\n\nParton is an author herself whose titles include the 1996 children’s book “Coat of Many Colors,” which is part of the book giveaway program.\n\nAs she prepared to sing her famous song by the same name, she explained that it is about a coat her mother made her from a patchwork of mismatched fabric, since the family was too poor to afford a large piece of a single fabric. Parton was proud of it because her mother likened it the multicolored coat that is told about in the Bible — a fantastic gift from Jacob to his son Joseph.\n\nClassmates, however, laughed at her. For years, she said the experience was a “deep, deep hurt.”\n\nShe said that with writing and performing the song, “the hurt just left me.” She received letters over the years from people saying it did the same thing for them.\n\n“The fact,” she explained, “that that little song has just meant so much not only to me, but to so many other people for so many different reasons, makes it my favorite song.”\n\nAsked in Kentucky about her lasting legacy, Parton said she’d like to be remembered as “a good ole girl” who worked hard and tried to make people happy and the world a better place.\n\n“Of course I want to be known as a songwriter and a singer, but I honestly can say that the Imagination Library has meant as much, if not more, to me than nearly anything that I’ve ever done,” she said.\n\n___\n\nHollingsworth reported from Mission, Kansas. Schreiner reported from Frankfort, Kentucky.",

The essay targeted the 78-year-old “Jolene” singer for her support of the LGBTQ community earlier this week.\n\nThe headline, “There’s Nothing Loving About Dolly Parton’s False Gospel,” caught many people off guard. Consequently, supporters flooded social media with critical messages about the essay. In response to the backlash, the writer expressed regret for using such a beloved figure to make her point.\n\nFederalist writer Ericka Andersen criticized Parton for her nonjudgmental approach to life. Specifically, Andersen took issue with Parton’s claim that she loves everyone, including members of the LGBTQ community. Furthermore, Parton has shown support for these communities in interviews.\n\nAdditionally, Andersen argued that if Parton is a Christian, as she proclaims, she should call out homosexuality as a sin. Andersen stated, “Parton’s version of love, which includes condoning immoral sexual behavior (‘be who you are,’ she’s said), is unaligned with God’s vision for humanity.”\n\nMoreover, Andersen told Yahoo Entertainment on Saturday that the widespread backlash made her realize she shouldn’t have used Parton to press her argument.\n\n“I regret using Dolly as the example for the point I was making in the article,” she said. “As I wrote in the piece, I love her and think she does some incredible things for the world. We all make poor choices in how to frame things sometimes. This was one of those moments for me! Dolly is one of the few people who is beloved by all and who loves all. The world is lucky to have her.”",

It’s the plight of teachers, caregivers, parents.”\n\nAn award-winning singer, actor and teaching artist, Shultz’s background includes performing in numerous productions in New York City. She said she has never had to memorize so much in a musical.\n\n“It’s enormously challenging and thrilling,” Shultz said. “Without a doubt, my favorite part has been sharing this process with professionals and connecting with that part of myself again. Even more so, sharing the stage with my students is a singular experience. I’ve loved watching their knowledge and passion thrive and grow, and it’s added a nuance to our work together.”\n\nThen, there are the musical’s famous songs.\n\n“Who can walk away not singing these songs? It's also a show that has featured some of the most iconic leading ladies since it premiered 60 years ago,” Shultz said. “Whatever your personal experience with love, you’ll find a story to connect with in the show, and I think it’s why it has stood the test of time.”\n\nSIU theater alumnus is director\n\n“Hello Dolly!” marks the 100th directing project for director Bill Kincaid, a former SIU faculty member and Master of Fine Arts theater graduate, since his thesis production in 1988. In addition to university productions, Kincaid, an emeritus faculty member at Western Illinois University, has directed comedies, dramas, musicals and Shakespeare at theaters in nine states, including Illinois. After going to SIU in the 1980s, Kincaid returned to serve on the theater faculty in the late 1990s and early 2000s and has directed several shows on the McLeod stage.\n\n“It feels fitting that my 100th show is back on the McLeod stage,” said Kincaid, who celebrated his 60th birthday on June 11, which was the first day of rehearsals. “It seemed fitting to start a new decade doing something I love so much and doing it in a location that has been such a big part of my life. I have a long history here and lots of great memories.”\n\nClassic tale of love and romance\n\nKincaid said his interest in the “beloved classic” begins with the play “The Matchmaker,” which was written by Thorton Wilder, and from where the musical adaptation was born.\n\nHe noted that “Before the Parade Passes By,” the last song in Act One, “is about embracing joy, putting the past behind you and living life to the fullest; it’s about looking around and acknowledging everyday beauty.”\n\n“It also intrigues me that the play follows the story of four couples, all at different stages in their lives, and it explores what love and romance mean to people of different ages,” Kincaid said. “Depending on where a person is in their life, they may be looking for various things in a relationship: adventure and excitement, passionate romantic love, the opportunity to start a family, or companionship and security. Love isn’t just one thing. It’s not that simple.”\n\nTalented cast\n\nThere are 22 actors in the cast, several of whom Kincaid has worked with before, including when he directed “Little Women” at SIU Carbondale in December 2022. That list of company members also includes Christopher Jorandy, a props artisan that Kincaid had as a student while at SIU. Kincaid and costume designer Wendi Zea have worked 17 shows together.\n\n“Rehearsals have been excellent. The level of talent in the room is staggering, and the singing is absolutely glorious,” he said. “We assembled a really great cast for this one.”\n\nMSP tickets available\n\nBeer and wine will be served at cash only bars in the lobby before performances and during intermission.",

      "# [Covering Dolly Parton and Dollywood while living in Knoxville is a joyful privilege by Devarrick Turner on 2024-08-27](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/opinion/2024/08/27/the-privilege-of-covering-dolly-parton-and-dollywood-in-knoxville/74833032007/)\nWhen I first started as a reporter at Knox News with an emphasis on entertainment and culture reporting, there was always a tease of a Dolly Parton interview. It felt like an elusive opportunity that might or might not happen.\n\nLike most of the world, I was already a big fan of Dolly’s music and her personality. I grew up singing “Jolene” and Whitney Houston’s version of “I Will Always Love You.”\n\nBut what I did not realize was just how special it is to cover Dollywood and the iconic figure behind it in the place she grew up and will always call home, especially at a time when the two cultural cornerstones are better than ever.\n\nDolly Parton's Dollywood is the best:Here's how it’s growing bigger and better\n\nEast Tennessee loves Dolly(wood)\n\nDollywood isn’t just a theme park. It’s a joyful noise of fun, family, cinnamon bread and Appalachian culture.\n\nI’ve had the privilege of having a front row seat to its growth over the past few years, such as the launch of its most expensive roller coaster, Big Bear Mountain, the opening of The Dolly Parton Experience museum, and HeartSong Lodge and Resort welcoming its first guests.\n\nMost important, I see how our local community is deeply connected to the beloved theme park and invested in its success. The park is vital to East Tennessee’s tourism and economy, significantly contributing to the growth of the region for nearly four decades.\n\nIt's also an extremely cool hangout spot, especially when discounted tickets and special deals are often available to East Tennessee residents.\n\nAnd Knoxville loves Dolly!\n\nThe vibrant mural of the Queen of Country by Megan Lingerfelt on Strong Alley is admired by all strolling through the heart of Downtown Knoxville. The annual Rhinestone Fest (formerly known as Dolly Fest) is a Dolly-inspired weekend full of music, movies, art and fun where everyone is encouraged to come dressed in their best Dolly outfits and wigs.\n\nRALA in Old City has a collection of goods and gifts crafted by local and regional artists. Loads of Dolly-themed items are available, including artwork. RALA hosts the Dolly Art Contest each year. Dolly artwork by nearly 40 local artists fills up a wall inside the store. I’ve been blown away by the creativity and talent of each piece in the art show every year.\n\nLove and appreciation for Dolly starts early in Knoxville. The Knox County Public Library participates in Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library program, helping provide free books to children 5 and younger. Any family in Knox County can sign up their children at any Knox County library, by calling 865-215-8743 or online at knoxcountylibrary.org.\n\nChasing Dolly Parton as a reporter\n\nLike the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, the Tennessee Valley Authority and Knoxville’s business scene, there’s always something going on with Dolly Parton. She’s released a brand of wines, a new cookbook is out, more baking mixes have hit grocery store shelves, or maybe there’s a secret collaboration with Beyoncé!\n\nNot even joking, as I write this, I just received a notification on my phone about Dolly’s new beauty line.\n\n“I believe beauty comes from within, but a little red lipstick never hurt. #DollyBeauty is available now!” reads the post on X, formerly called Twitter.\n\nThough she retired from touring a couple of years ago, Dolly’s already legendary career has skyrocketed. Not only through product deals, but because of her music and a well-maintained cultural significance.\n\n“Rockstar,” her first rock album, came out last year and was her highest-charting album debut ever, hitting No. 1 on three Billboard charts. And she released a duet with singer Post Malone earlier this month, in addition to recently working with Beyoncé and rapper Pitbull.\n\nThanks to her ever-expanding empire, those elusive Dolly interviews did eventually come my way. She’s exactly as you’d imagine, and we’ve been able to have fun chats about her new projects, Dollywood, and her love of the Great Smoky Mountains.\n\nLast year, the USA TODAY Network hired reporters to specifically cover pop star moguls Taylor Swift and Beyoncé. Here in Knoxville, I’ve become the “Dollywood/Dolly Parton reporter.” It’s an unofficial title but being able to share stories on the growing popular theme park and its namesake with our readers has been a wonderful experience professionally and personally.\n\nIt’s evident how much Dolly and Dollywood mean to the people of East Tennessee. She means the same to us. Definitely check Knox News regularly. You never know what exciting news Dolly has to share with next.\n\nDevarrick Turner is a trending news reporter.

      "# [Johnny, June, Mrs. Doubtfire, and Dolly by LGBTQSD COUNTY NEWS, lgbtqsd.news on 2024-07-05](https://lgbtqsd.news/johnny-june-mrs-doubtfire-and-dolly/)\nCurtain Call\n\nby Chris Barone\n\nAs we approach Pride season, it’s been quite a busy month for me as we prepare Baja Betty’s for our 20th Pride, however, I was still able to enjoy two great productions right here in our own backyard.\n\nI will never be too busy to spend an afternoon or evening at the theater. For me, the month of June included the direct-from-Broadway production of Mrs. Doubtfire at The San Diego Civic Theater and the world premiere musical, The Ballad of Johnny and June at La Jolla Playhouse.\n\nHellooooooo!\n\nFirst, let me discuss Mrs. Doubtfire. For the most part, it was the movie live onstage with all of the beloved scenes from the film. Not a shocker. The book writers, Karen Kirkpatrick and John O’Farrell, definitely kept that in mind when constructing this and it didn’t disappoint the audience. They knew their audience going in and stayed true to the source material. Many of the jokes and the physical comedy are a tribute to the late, ever-so-brilliant Robin Williams, who originally created the role.\n\nIn this day and age, where so many movies are being adapted for the stage, this was really an enjoyable one. It manages to capture the two most important aspects of the movie: heart and humor. I feel like several of the “cookie cutter” shows or jukebox musicals lack that, so I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nWhat else can I say except that Tony nominee Rob McClure is a tour de force as the title character. Wow! He would have 100% gotten my vote for “Best Actor in a Musical” if I was a Tony voter when he was nominated in 2022. He never stopped moving and owning both of his characters; Daniel Hillard and the one and only, Mrs. Doubtfire. I’m still baffled how he could switch back and forth between his characters with such honest and believable ease. I absolutely adored him. Kudos.\n\nWith that being said, I have a great story to share about the amazing Rob McClure …\n\nI was scheduled for my annual spring jaunt to The Broadway at the end of March 2020. Well, we all know what happened and needless to say, my butt sat on my couch in San Diego instead of inside a theater in NYC. The world closed down and I was stuck at home in my apartment when I should have been roaming the streets of New York and checking off all of the Broadway shows that I was waiting to see. One that I had tickets for was Mrs. Doubtfire. Anyway, knowing how sad I was, I got the most wonderful and thoughtful gift from my pals, Darcy and Joey. Imagine my surprise when I get a personal Cameo from Rob McClure himself! He said the kindest things and shared my sadness for the closure of Broadway. I’ll never forget his optimism and hopefulness about the return of Broadway because at that point, we had no idea how long it would be closed. Who would have ever guessed that it would close down for 18 months?\n\nThe young actors that portrayed the kids were fabulous. It’s quite impressive to see the huge amounts of talent in the youth on stage these days. They’re the future of musical theater and were all very promising. The supporting characters (including McClure’s real life wife, Maggie Lakis, as Miranda) were all great in their portrayal but honestly, I couldn’t focus on anyone else if Daniel/Mrs. Doubtfire was in the scene. The ensemble were all fabulous, too. A strong company of actors that could sing, dance and keep the show’s transitions moving effortlessly.\n\nAlso included in the cast is the incomparable Jonathan Hoover, who is the best Patti LuPone impersonator ever. Please check out his Instagram, @inappropriatepatti. A night at the theater is even better when you have a friend in the show. Thanks, Jonathan!\n\nCashing In\n\nNext up was the world premiere of the musical, The Ballad of Johnny and June at The La Jolla Playhouse, directed by Tony award winner and LJP favorite, Des McAnuff.\n\nAs a lifelong fan of country music, I was already familiar with the story of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. I’m a sucker for a love story and this one is definitely one for the ages. With a live band onstage playing all of their greatest and most memorable songs, the deep and often complicated story of Johnny and June unfolds before the audience as a tale told by their son, John Carter Cash. I knew right from the time that the band started and Johnny and June appeared that we were in for a toe-tappin’ time. I wasn’t wrong.\n\nCreated with the support of the Cash family, this new musical covers it all: their childhoods, their epic 1956 meeting at the Grand Ole Opry, the storied on-stage proposal in 1968, the soaring highs and whiplash lows of fame, life on the road, addiction, arrests, controversies, marriage, family and devotion. Reminds me of an episode of one of my soaps, only a real life version. This is a whole-hearted and clear-eyed telling of one of the most iconic love stories in music history, complete with a soundtrack of beloved hits — I Walk the Line, Ring of Fire, Hey Porter, Jackson, I’ve Been Everywhere and many more.\n\nA story as iconic as this one needs the right actors to bring the larger-than-life characters to fruition. The folks at La Jolla Playhouse got this one right. As Johnny Cash, Christopher Ryan Grant, did right by “The Man in Black.” His swagger and deep baritone painted a very effective portrait of Cash. He definitely made you not want to like him but when all was said and done, you couldn’t help but like him. His story reminds me of the saying, “hurt people hurt people.” I could see what June saw in Johnny and the very palpable chemistry of the lead actors made it all the more believable. Patti Murin’s June was a hoot and a spitfire right out of the gate from the very top of the show. Her performance was grounded, playful and full of charisma; a perfect balance to Johnny’s brooding and darkness, especially when he hit his lows.\n\nAs the story’s narrator, John Carter Cash (played by Van Hughes) beautifully illustrates his parent’s 47 years together; from their first meeting on the stage of The Grand Ole Opry through the ending of their love story, leaving this world only four months apart. His character worked well in establishing a storyline of his parents beyond what is known in the press and from the movie released several years ago.\n\nHis guitar picking onstage and song, “The Ballad of Johnny and June,” the only original tune in the piece, fit well and propelled the story. It worked seamlessly how the character weaved in and out of the story as the voice of it but then easily became part of the scenes and blended right in. His scene with June discussing her addiction was heartbreaking, especially seeing the love a son has for his mother.\n\nI can’t forget to acknowledge a very solid ensemble of supporting characters and musicians who bring the story to life. Pamela Leggett Chase has always been a standout in anything I’ve seen her in; it’s nice to see her in her first LJP performance. Also a huge shout out to the entire production staff and crew for creating this special piece of theatre. The book by Robert Cary and Des McAnuff, who also serves as director, complements the musical soundtrack nicely, courtesy of Johnny and June Cash, along with a host of other artists and legends.\n\nIf this show goes to Broadway, which I think it probably will, it definitely needs a little fine tuning. While the whole first act was entertaining, it did run a bit long. I don’t usually get antsy but I found myself getting a little fidgety (and the seats at LJP are comfortable with plenty of legroom, too). But nothing some small revisions and tightening up can’t fix.\n\nThe pacing of Act 2 worked perfectly, so hopefully, the production team can do the same for the first act. If/when it makes its way to Broadway, I’ll be buying tickets. I always enjoy seeing the changes/updates but most importantly, supporting all of the incredible theater right here in San Diego. We are so lucky.\n\nThe only other very small thing that I noticed was June’s hair. I come from the school of big, country queen hair and I felt like June’s wig needed a little more to it. My inner drag queen wanted to get out a rat tail comb and a can of Aqua Net. As Patti Murin is small in stature, I guess they didn’t want her swallowed up by a Dolly Parton sized mound of hair. The higher the hair, the closer to heaven!\n\nThe Ballad of Johnny and June is a must see if you are a lover of the Cash legacy. It continues at La Jolla Playhouse through Sunday, July 7. Tickets are very limited through the rest of the run; however, more are being released daily, so please check their website at lajollaplayhouse.org.\n\nOh Dolly\n\nAnd since I happened to mention Dolly Parton above, have you heard the news that she has written her life story as a Broadway musical!? Called, “Hello, I’m Dolly,” it depicts her life story from her upbringing in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee to her journey of becoming a global icon. It is set to premiere in 2026 in conjunction with Dolly’s 80th birthday. I promise you that I will be in the audience on opening night. Mark my words!\n\nAs I always say, until next time, friends. Be happy. Be kind. Go to the theater. It makes for a great recipe for life.\n\n–Originally from upstate New York, Chris Barone (aka “Miss B”) has been a part of the San Diego/Hillcrest community for 20 years. You probably know him mostly from Baja Betty’s, where he has worked since opening in 2004.

      "# [Dolly Parton, governor celebrate Imagination Library mark by Austin Schick on 2024-08-28](https://spectrumnews1.com/ky/louisville/news/2024/08/28/dolly-parton-in-lexington)\nLEXINGTON, Ky. â Grammy Award-winning country music artist Dolly Parton visited Lexington Tuesday to celebrate her Imagination Library in Kentucky.\n\nAll 120 counties in Kentucky recently got access to Partonâs Imagination Library. The country music legend joined Gov. Andy Beshear, D-Ky., and first lady Britainy Beshear to commemorate the occasion.\n\nParton started the Imagination Library in 1995 to honor her father, who could not read or write.\n\nâHe was always real embarrassed about that and that always troubled him because he thought that he couldnât learn to read after he was grown, but daddy was one of the smartest people that you would ever want to know, and he was my hero,â Parton said.\n\nThe no-cost program provides one book a month to children from childbirth to the age of five. Nationwide, over 3 million kids are registered with over 250 million books gifted since its inception.\n\nâItâs really a great way to teach children when theyâre very young to learn to love books and to learn to read,â Parton said.\n\nParton started the program locally in her east Tennessee hometown. Since then, it has grown to 21 states and numerous countries. In Kentucky, over 120,000 children receive free books every month. The program is available from Pikeville to Paducah, with over 6 million books distributed statewide.\n\nâForty-five percent of preschoolers in our state are currently enrolled in the Imagination Library. So that means if you know someone in that 55%, you better get on your phones as soon as we leave here,â said first lady Beshear.\n\nCongressman Morgan McGarvey, D-Louisville, worked to pass the funding for the program during his time in the Kentucky Senate. It was passed in a bipartisan manner.\n\nâBy having every child eligible, thereâs no stigma attached. Kids who are going to kindergarten, not only are they more kindergarten ready, theyâve read some of the same books and they have that common bond,â McGarvey said.\n\nThe statewide program is supported by a 50% state to local program match provided in the state budget, passed by the General Assembly.\n\nThe governor also honored Parton as a Kentucky Colonel and proclaimed the month âImagination Library of Kentucky Month.â\n\nFirst lady Beshear presented Parton with a copy of First Dog Winnieâs new coloring book, âWinnie Goes on a Kentucky State Parks Adventure!â In return, Parton gifted the governor and first lady with a copy of her childrenâs book, âCoat of Many Colors,â named after her hit 1971 song.\n\nMore than 20 years ago, Henderson County established the first Imagination Library program in Kentucky.",

      "# [Dolly Parton Dishes on a New Cookbook, the ‘9 to 5’ Remake and Beyoncé’s Country Music Awards Snub by Nicole Fell on 2024-09-19](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/dolly-parton-rachel-parton-cookbook-home-chef-9-to-5-beyonce-1236005957/)\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n“Dolly cooks quite a bit like our mother,” says Rachel Parton George. “It makes me think of Mama.”\n\nNow everyone can think of Parton’s mom — or at least cook like her — as the legendary country singer and her sister have teamed up for a new recipe book, Good Lookin’ Cookin’, which released Tuesday. A Home Chef partnership tied to the release will allow customers to order some of the dishes in the cookbook for home delivery.\n\nThe sisters spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about what it was like to create the book together. “We spend time together, but getting to spend this much time, this kind of time being creative like that and being holed up together in the kitchen, you get to know yourselves as grown-ups and it’s just very special,” Parton tells THR.\n\nParton says that being able to watch Parton George and “seeing how serious she is and how great she is” has taught her a great deal. It’s also been something of a nostalgia trip for both of them. “We often talk about Mama and then we’ll start talking about our aunts, our grandmothers, our dad, some of our brothers,” Parton George explains. “It has just been a great opportunity to share memories and recipes.”\n\nParton also provided an update on whether or not she might be part of the upcoming Jennifer Aniston-produced 9 to 5 remake. “We are in discussion with that with Jennifer Aniston and a couple of people,” Parton says.\n\n“We’re hoping at some point there might be a new version of it with new and younger people, whether I’ll be involved as a producer or even be in it,” she continues, confirming conversation is going on. “I still think it’d be a wonderful idea to do it,” Parton says, noting how workplaces and the technology used in them now are “so different” than when they made the original movie in 1980.\n\nAniston is producing the film alongside her partner Kristin Hahn through her Echo Films banner. Oscar-winning Juno writer Diablo Cody will pen the script. She’s also written movies like Jennifer’s Body and, most recently, Lisa Frankenstein, starring Cole Sprouse and Kathryn Newton.\n\n“I don’t know what will come of it, but it would be great,” Parton says of the project.\n\nThe iconic country singer also spoke about Beyoncé’s latest album, Cowboy Carter, in which Beyoncé sings Parton’s song “Jolene.” Earlier this month, the singer was snubbed by the CMA Awards despite having had one of the year’s biggest country albums with Cowboy Carter and biggest country songs with “Texas Hold ‘Em.”\n\nParton said she “didn’t even realize that [the snub] had happened,” calling Cowboy Carter “a great album.”\n\n“I was very honored that she had chosen my song, Jolene,” Parton says, noting Beyoncé’s cover was different than her original. “As a songwriter, you always love to hear how other people interpret your music, so I was real proud.”"
