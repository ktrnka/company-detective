Please read all the terms before you directly (or indirectly) access or use (or have a third-party access or use) any component of the Dolly Platform on your behalf or for your benefit. If a term does not make sense to you, please let us know. If you don't agree to these Terms, you may not access or use (or ask a third party to access or use) the Dolly Platform on your behalf or for your benefit.\n\nModifications\n\nYou represent and warrant that you will review these Terms prior to making a Request and that any continued access or use of the Dolly Platform is subject to the then current Terms posted at the time of your access or use.\n\nWe reserve the right to change these Terms from time to time. The Terms applicable to you are the Terms in place when you access or use the Dolly Platform. If we make changes to the Terms, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of these Terms and, in some cases, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification).\n\nWe encourage you to review the Terms regularly, and prior to initiating any new Request on the Dolly Platform so that you are aware of the most current Terms which will apply at the time of your access or usage. If you do not agree to the Terms effective at the time of access or usage, then you should discontinue all use of the Dolly Platform.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFor information about how we collect, use and share information about users of the Dolly Platform, please see our Privacy Policy at http://dolly.com/privacy.\n\nDescription of the Dolly Platform\n\nThrough the Dolly Platform, you can submit a request (a \"Request\") for a Helper to pick up the item(s) you specify (each, an \"Item\") for loading, unloading, moving, hauling, packing, lifting, assembly or disassembly (the \"Services\"). You will receive a price quote for the fee that will apply to completing your Request for the Services (the \"Services Fee\"). Once you submit the payment information to cover the Service Fee for the Request, your Request will be sent out to our network of Helpers. You will receive a notification through the Dolly Platform when a Helper has accepted your Request and agrees to provide the Services, and you will be able to communicate with that Helper through the Dolly Platform to confirm and coordinate certain logistics involved with completing your Request.\n\nYou represent and warrant that the Items related to any Request are your personal property or that you have the requisite permissions, consents, and rights to make the Request of the Helper to perform the Services in relation to the Items specified in the Request and that completing the Services in relation to the Items identified in the Request will not result in the violation of any laws, regulations, contracts or agreements to which you are bound, or third party's rights of any kind.\n\nCreating Accounts\n\nWhen you create an account you must maintain the security of your password. If you discover or suspect that someone is accessing your account without your permission or has obtained your password or that there is any Dolly Platform security breaches, please let us know as soon as possible. You represent and warrant to us that all information that you provide in connection with your account is accurate, truthful, current and complete. Dolly reserves the right to deny any account at our discretion.\n\nPayment for Services\n\nYou must provide credit card information to submit a Request. You are responsible for paying the applicable Services Fee for any completed Services. Once you submit a Request, we will place a temporary hold on the credit card account you provided in an amount equal to 100% of the applicable Services Fee. Once you and the Helper have verified that the Services are completed, you will have the option of paying an additional gratuity (a \"Tip\") to the Helper, and your credit card account will be charged for the sum of the Services Fee, any Tip, and the fees for any additional services you may request.\n\nYou agree to make all payments to the Helper through the Dolly Platform and will not pay any Helper in cash or means other than directly through the Dolly Platform.\n\nCanceling a Request\n\nIf you cancel any Request before a Helper accepts it you will not be charged and the hold will be lifted on your credit card. If you cancel any Request after a Helper accepts it, your credit card account may be charged up to 100% of the applicable Services Fee as set forth in Dolly's cancellation policy.\n\nRight to Use the Dolly Platform; Certain Restrictions\n\nOn the condition that you fully comply with these Terms, Dolly grants you a limited, nonexclusive, non-transferable and revocable license to access and use the Dolly Platform for your own personal, non-commercial use.\n\nHowever, with respect to access and use of the App, you represent and warrant that you will only download and access the App on mobile devices that you own or control or that you have express permission to use.\n\nThese Terms will govern your access and use of any upgrades provided by Dolly that replace and/or supplement the original App, Site(s), or other components of the Dolly Platform.

Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Dolly will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.\n\nIf settlement is not reached within 60 days after service of a written demand for mediation, any unresolved controversy or claim will be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association before a single arbitrator in Seattle, Washington. The language of all proceedings and filings will be English. The arbitrator will render a written opinion including findings of fact and law and the award and/or determination of the arbitrator will be binding on the parties, and their respective administrators and assigns, and will not be subject to appeal. Judgment may be entered upon the award of the arbitrator in any court of competent jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration will be shared equally by the parties unless the arbitration determines that the expenses will be otherwise assessed and the prevailing party may be awarded its attorneys' fees and expenses by the arbitrator. It is the intent of the parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances, arbitration proceedings will be concluded within 90 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit only if failure to do so would unduly prejudice the rights of the parties. Failure to adhere to this time limit will not constitute a basis for challenging the award. Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, pre-hearing information exchange will be limited to the reasonable production of relevant, non-privileged documents, carried out expeditiously.\n\nFor any disputes between the Parties that are not handled by arbitration, you agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms and/or the subject matter covered by these Terms shall be filed only in the state and federal courts located in Seattle, Washington and the Parties each hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding between the Parties arising out of or relating these Terms and/or the subject matter covered by these Terms.\n\nGeneral\n\nEnforcement of these Terms is solely at Dolly's discretion. Failure to enforce any part of these Terms in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce the same or other part of these Terms in other instances.\n\nIf any provision of these Terms is or becomes unlawful, void or otherwise unenforceable (including the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations above), then that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.\n\nThe section headings of these Terms are for reference purposes only and will not affect the meaning or interpretation of these Terms.\n\nThese Terms (and terms or policies incorporated herein) make up the entire agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter covered herein, including access and use of Dolly Platform, Requests, and the Services, and they supersede any other terms, whether implied or expressed.\n\nContact Us\n\nIf you have any questions about these Terms, please email us at [email protected] or send a letter to:\n\nDolly, Inc.\n\n9450 SW Gemini Dr., PMB 43895\n\nBeaverton, Oregon 97008-7105\n\nNotice for California Users\n\nIf you are a California resident, you may have these Terms mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to the address above with your electronic mail address and a request for these Terms. Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California Website users are entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 1625 N. Market Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.\n\nNotice Regarding Apple\n\nApple, Inc. and Other Third-Party Beneficiaries. You acknowledge and agree that Apple, Inc. (\"Apple\") and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and further that (a) upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party; (b) these Terms are conducted between you and Dolly only, and not Apple; (c) Dolly, and not Apple, is solely responsible for the Dolly Platform and the content thereof provided by Dolly; (d) Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Dolly Platform; (e) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no warranty obligation with respect to the Dolly Platform; and Dolly, and not Apple, will be responsible for any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure of the Dolly Platform to conform to any applicable warranty; (f) in the event of any third party claim that the Dolly Platform or your possession and use of that Dolly Platform infringes that third party's intellectual property rights, Apple will not be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim; and (g) Apple will not be responsible for addressing any of your claims or any third party claims relating to the Dolly Platform or your possession and/or use of the Dolly Platform, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Dolly Platform fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.\n\nNotice Regarding Damage Protection\n\nPlease note that Damage Protection only applies to the goods being transported. It does not protect damage to the environment surrounding the Dolly (e.g. floors, walls, ceiling, etc.). Additionally, for Damage Protection and insurance purposes, the value of any given item is considered to be the lesser of (a) the price at which it was most recently purchased (last 12 months), or (b) the cost of replacement, as may be reasonably determined by Dolly. Further, the value of such an item is determined independently of the amount of any supplemental Damage Protection purchased from Dolly (in addition to the $300 of complimentary Damage Protection provided by Dolly). For example, if $1,000 of supplemental Damage Protection were purchased, the recent purchase price was $300, and the cost of replacement were $400, then Damage Protection would cover $300. Dolly reserves the right to reject any claims of damage not submitted within 14 days of the damaging incident. Dolly is not responsible for any damage that is incurred outside of the express-written parameters of the move as purchased by the customer. Any act undertaken by our independent contractors that is not explicitly paid for may not qualify for Damage Protection.",

      "# [Demand Local Moving & Delivery Marketplace](https://dolly.com/refer-terms)\nDolly Referral Program Terms & Conditions\n\nThe Dolly Referral Program allows registered Dolly users to earn promotional credits toward future Dollys by referring their friends as first-time Dolly users. To participate, Dolly users must agree to the following terms.\n\nEarning Referral Dolly Credits\n\nDolly Users can earn Dolly Credits towards future Dollys if: (i) a referred friend clicks on their referral link to create a valid Dolly account that complies with the Dolly Terms of Service; and (ii) the referred friend books and completes a Dolly. Only once the referred friend has completed their Dolly, will the referring Dolly User receive their credit.\n\nThe referring Dolly User will be credited with the Dolly Credit amount described in the referral invitation or accompanying promotional materials. The maximum Referral Dolly Credits per User at any given time is $200, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nDolly Credits may only be redeemed via Dolly.com and the Dolly application. Dolly Credits must be used within 30 days of the claim date. After 30 days, the Dolly Credits will expire. Dolly Credits have no cash value and may not be transferred or exchanged for cash.\n\nDolly Credits may not be earned by creating multiple Dolly Accounts. Dolly Credits accrued in separate accounts may not be combined into one Dolly account.\n\nIf for any reason you believe that there is a discrepancy regarding the balance of credits on your account, please contact [email protected]. All decisions regarding your balance will be final and at Dollyâs sole discretion.\n\nReferral Links\n\nReferral links should not be published or distributed where there is no reasonable basis for believing that all or most of the recipients are personal friends (such as coupon websites, Reddit, or Wikipedia).\n\nReferred Dolly Users\n\nReferred friends that have booked a Dolly using a valid referral link do not receive Dolly credits.\n\nMultiple Referrals\n\nA referred friend may only use one referral link. If a referred friend receives referral links from multiple Dolly Users, only the corresponding Dolly User of the referral link used by the referred friend will receive Dolly Credit.\n\nTermination and Changes\n\nDolly may suspend or terminate the Referral Program or a userâs ability to participate in the Referral Program at any time for any reason.\n\nWe reserve the right to suspend accounts or remove Dolly Credits if we notice any activity that we believe is abusive, fraudulent or in direct violation of the Dolly Terms of Service. We reserve the right to review and investigate all referral activities and to suspend accounts or modify referrals in our sole discretion as deemed fair and appropriate.\n\nUpdates to the Terms\n\nDolly reserves the right to update these terms at any time without prior notice. If the terms are modified, the most recent version will be posted on the Dolly.com website, applications, or services, which are effective upon posting. Continued participation in the Referral Program after any modification shall constitute consent to such modification.",

Over the last 6 years, we have continually evolved the Dolly service to be ever more convenient, transparent, and reliable. Bringing Dolly and Updater together takes that one step further by allowing consumers to organize, manage, and execute a move all in one seamless, integrated experience.\n\nSince launching in Chicago, we have expanded our service to over 40 markets in the US. We have served hundreds of thousands of customers, worked with some of the world's most respected retail brands, and handled millions of items, all while delivering best-in-class customer satisfaction. We have supported thousands of Dolly Helpers by providing them with a flexible source of income through which they've collectively earned tens of millions of dollars. I am extremely proud of the impact this team has had on the mission we set out to achieve: to create freedom of time, of choice, and from worry.\n\nBut, this combination is not a destination—it's a milestone along a much longer journey. Dolly will continue to live on as you know it today, just as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Updater. There is still so much work to be done. With more resources and a broader reach, we are even better equipped to improve and expand the Dolly service, providing ever greater value to our customers and to our retail partners while providing our Helpers and Hands with more high-quality income opportunities.\n\nThank you for your ongoing support of Dolly. The future of Dolly is brighter than ever and we look forward to continuing to bring you a best-in-class moving and delivery service.\n\nMike Howell\n\nCEO\n\nUpdater press release",

The bad experiences kept piling up and NOTHING was done to make it right despite reaching out to the customer concern team numerous times, trying to give them a chance. \n\nThe support is absolutely garbage. They don’t even have a number to reach if there is an immediate emergency (which more often than not, issues arise). You can leave a voicemail over phone then wait about 3 days for a response or send an email and again, wait some time to hear back. Not very helpful when in a pinch. \n\nThey used to pay well, now the wages are a joke for the drive time/work time combination (at least here in CA). Is $20 worth driving 25 miles each way to load and unload a couch worth it? With gas near 5 dollars a gallon, not so much. Sad part is they can afford to give their workers quite a bit more or actually pay for a support team!!\n\nWhat really irks me is that this company literally only has to pay the help (us) and their little bit of staff,  meaning they have very little overhead. Although, like all other companies in today’s world, they are greedy and could give a **** about the people actually doing the work.

One was a delivery route for The Container Store with 5 different deliveries all over L.A. it said there would be a tip for each delivery, but the tip was $0 for the whole route. It took 3.5 hours (locations were far apart) and paid $55. Used at least $20 in gas. One of the deliveries was to an $11 million dollar house in Beverly Hills. I don’t know if Dolly is pocketing the tips, or if there were really 0 out of 5 people that tipped. Either way it is less than minimum wage and not worth it. The 2nd Dolly I did was to move a dresser for $37. The dresser was very heavy and the location we delivered it to had a staircase that looked like it was designed by someone trying to make a staircase that was impossible to carry furniture up. It was the worst. After we finished, The client said they have had several delivery people just leave things at the bottom of the stairs and refuse to even try. Both of these jobs I knew would only be worth it when including a tip. Not one of them tipped. That 2nd client saw us laboring and dripping sweat and struggling to carry a heavy piece of furniture up the worst set of stairs. I have lost a little bit of my faith in humanity, my whole body hurts, and I’m never working Dolly again. You can make more money with Instacart or Uber Eats or anything but this. It’s not worth it. They need to pay more, or make the client tip beforehand like Postmates does. Then we can consider if we want to do the job. When you give people an option to tip after the service is provided, we apparently get screwed 6 out of 6 times. We aren’t waiters who should be tipped after providing good service with a smile. We are moving heavy things into small places and should know how much we are going to make beforehand. The tip should be made beforehand, and we can consider it when deciding whether or not to take the job.",

Because they pay very low, once I needed a helper for one hour and try to hire one from Dolly. Usually they pay $30/hr, but at the end were asking me to pay more than $80/hr for one person. Do the calculations and think if it’s worth it even to open an account with them. I paid $25 fee, lost hours to complete the account and at the end, all it’s wasted. How someone will say that it’s easy to work with. Even if you bid for a job, most likely you won’t get it because they decide who will.

What happened to the countdown? Even when I go to review it right away, same thing. How are the $100+ jobs always gone immediately, (bots?). Also, in the past if I had waited say 5 seconds before reviewing a job it meant my count down clock wouldn’t start for seconds which wouldn’t allow me to accept a job until 5 seconds later than anyone who had started reviewing it before me. Why not just start everyone’s clock at the same time?

Well since I’m already signed up with dolly they still penalized me for it through the dolly app when the Instawork app mentioned nothing about it being for dolly. And even in the Dolly app it says I have one last minute cancel from November yet they still claim I have 2 in the last 90 days when the app/my profile clearly states one. I showed them all the proof, they still refuse to try to find a resolution. Every rep I’ve talked to is extremely condescending, rude, unprofessional, and hard to explain.

The bad experiences kept piling up and NOTHING was done to make it right despite reaching out to the customer concern team numerous times, trying to give them a chance. \n\nThe support is absolutely garbage. They don’t even have a number to reach if there is an immediate emergency (which more often than not, issues arise). You can leave a voicemail over phone then wait about 3 days for a response or send an email and again, wait some time to hear back. Not very helpful when in a pinch. \n\nThey used to pay well, now the wages are a joke for the drive time/work time combination (at least here in CA). Is $20 worth driving 25 miles each way to load and unload a couch worth it? With gas near 5 dollars a gallon, not so much. Sad part is they can afford to give their workers quite a bit more or actually pay for a support team!!\n\nWhat really irks me is that this company literally only has to pay the help (us) and their little bit of staff,  meaning they have very little overhead.

      "# Less than minimum wage, 1 stars [(Mneurp, Apple App Store, 2022-12-23)](https://apple/9427250451)\nJust finished my first 2 Dollys. One was a delivery route for The Container Store with 5 different deliveries all over L.A. it said there would be a tip for each delivery, but the tip was $0 for the whole route. It took 3.5 hours (locations were far apart) and paid $55. Used at least $20 in gas. One of the deliveries was to an $11 million dollar house in Beverly Hills. I don’t know if Dolly is pocketing the tips, or if there were really 0 out of 5 people that tipped. Either way it is less than minimum wage and not worth it. The 2nd Dolly I did was to move a dresser for $37. The dresser was very heavy and the location we delivered it to had a staircase that looked like it was designed by someone trying to make a staircase that was impossible to carry furniture up. It was the worst. After we finished, The client said they have had several delivery people just leave things at the bottom of the stairs and refuse to even try. Both of these jobs I knew would only be worth it when including a tip. Not one of them tipped. That 2nd client saw us laboring and dripping sweat and struggling to carry a heavy piece of furniture up the worst set of stairs. I have lost a little bit of my faith in humanity, my whole body hurts, and I’m never working Dolly again. You can make more money with Instacart or Uber Eats or anything but this. It’s not worth it. They need to pay more, or make the client tip beforehand like Postmates does. Then we can consider if we want to do the job. When you give people an option to tip after the service is provided, we apparently get screwed 6 out of 6 times. We aren’t waiters who should be tipped after providing good service with a smile. We are moving heavy things into small places and should know how much we are going to make beforehand. The tip should be made beforehand, and we can consider it when deciding whether or not to take the job.",

Because they pay very low, once I needed a helper for one hour and try to hire one from Dolly. Usually they pay $30/hr, but at the end were asking me to pay more than $80/hr for one person. Do the calculations and think if it’s worth it even to open an account with them. I paid $25 fee, lost hours to complete the account and at the end, all it’s wasted. How someone will say that it’s easy to work with. Even if you bid for a job, most likely you won’t get it because they decide who will.

It was really dispiriting. We eventually had to rent a U-Haul and do it ourselves, with help from a couple of the store's employees.\n\nThere was no way we were getting it up to the kitchen from street level ourselves, though, so it sat in our garage for a month until we finally got a lead on JOB4MOVERS. Two guys came out in a van with one of those two-person slings, and had the old range removed and the new one in the kitchen in like 10 minutes. They even took the old range away for an extra $25 or $30 (Seattle Public Utilities charges $30 or $38 for curbside appliance removal, which I already thought was a good deal).\n\n## Comment ID kxl6avb with +1 score by [(chuckcarter, Reddit, 2024-04-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/19dd1un/alternatives_to_dolly_app/kxl6avb/) (in reply to ID 19dd1un):\nLugg!\n\n### Comment ID l4572en with +1 score by [(Single_Bedroom4675, Reddit, 2024-05-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/19dd1un/alternatives_to_dolly_app/l4572en/) (in reply to ID kxl6avb):\nSucks ass\n\n\n\n## Comment ID kj81bvo with +1 score by [(Raksidelic, Reddit, 2024-01-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/19dd1un/alternatives_to_dolly_app/kj81bvo/) (in reply to ID 19dd1un):\nI used Dolly for a move before and for two recent moves I used goshare.co.

So far, the app Dolly is far and away the cheapest option. I’m a little worried, though, because I’ll be moving my entire bedroom + a few odds and ends.

Most newer ones also have 4 wheels. The dolly leans at a 45 degree angle with all 4 wheels on the ground to make moving them more stable. It can be tilted upright with only 2 wheels on the ground for loading and unloading. \n   \nSource: move gas cylinders around a chemical lab.\n\n#### Comment ID in1g0d3 with +4 score by [(Morkrazy, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in1g0d3/) (in reply to ID in18ol5):\nThe single handle makes them easier to pull behind you.

Dalton's, these were invaluable for carrying books up the stairs. H-carts were out of the question, the stairs turned halfway up.\n\nOSHA hazards aside, as a mall bookstore, we didn't bring the H-carts out on the floor often because, well, floor space. Takes up too much room and with people walking around with food and drink, we'd have abandoned leavings all the time if we did, I'm sure. So, V-carts to the rescue, H-carts for when the store was closed or it was going to be left behind the registers and you used that as the home base while you refilled the bestsellers, or what have you, at the front of the store.\n\nGenerally you'd sort by height, first and foremost, biggest books at the bottom, usually one v-cart per section of the store. If you were doing the fiction wall, try to alphabetize it a bit first (because the fiction wall, as implied, was a whole wall that ran the length of the store). But anything else -- eh. Most other sections were relatively compact. I think sci-fi / fantasy and romance were the two largest sections next to fiction, and if I'm remembering right, they were about six, maybe eight bays each. But, three (or four?) bays on one side facing the middle aisle (the main drag, with the most open space), and the same number on the opposite side, facing the fiction wall.\n\nSo if it wasn't alphabetically sorted in advance, you weren't *too* badly off. Especially since after a while, you memorized what letter was the last one used on each section's side, so if you came across an author on the latter half of the alphabet, no big deal, leave it on the cart until you had a few for the other side.\n\nOh, and if you've only got mass markets, you can fit two columns of books, easy, three of you turned them right, or had a single large hardcover on the bottom to serve as a larger base, like that illustrated (or was it just a collector's edition?) The Da Vinci Code that came out for a while there. That book was great for stacking books on the smaller V-carts.\n\n## Comment ID in05amf with +17 score by [(Mega_Zawesome, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in05amf/) (in reply to ID x580vr):\nah yes, the humble v-cart. the good ones have the rubber on the bottom edge so you can ram it into the doors in the back\n\n## Comment ID imzzi52 with +28 score by [(theHLB, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/imzzi52/) (in reply to ID x580vr):\nThe trusty Barnes & Noble V-cart. 🙂\n\n## Comment ID in018rt with +11 score by [(Alertox, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in018rt/) (in reply to ID x580vr):\nSymmetrical book stacking…just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947.\n\n### Comment ID in0nef7 with +6 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in0nef7/) (in reply to ID in018rt):\nYou're right, no human being would stack books like this.\n\n#### Comment ID in0uqax with +2 score by [(LawDog23, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in0uqax/) (in reply to ID in0nef7):\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Wel63QwhfpU\n\n## Comment ID in11e1h with +10 score by [(tI-_-tI, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in11e1h/) (in reply to ID x580vr):\nWhen it breaks, and you order new parts, do you have to ask \"is the Dolly part in?\"\n\n### Comment ID in18vtp with +2 score by [(Nosmurfz, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in18vtp/) (in reply to ID in11e1h):\nI see what you did there\n\n#### Comment ID in2p0d4 with +2 score by [(tI-_-tI, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in2p0d4/) (in reply to ID in18vtp):\nShout out Dolly Parton's Imagination Library!  https://imaginationlibrary.com/\n\n## Comment ID in0ax8v with +10 score by [(Domestica, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in0ax8v/) (in reply to ID x580vr):\nBack when I worked at b&n, the SM liked to use these carts to stack the cash tills when transporting them from the office to the front registers.

If Dolly had a strong Ikea delivery base of customers or built in features, that acquisition would make sense.  I’m not entirely sure I have this right and I was never interested in Teamo because the only way to make it profitable enough for the provider would have been to have at least six deliveries lined up simultaneously in a small neighborhood radius.  TaskRabbit didn’t seem organized enough to try to pull off something that efficient and Teamo never made it past the test metro anyhow, so I don’t think there’s much info on it.  Now they have Dolly and it’s generally in line with their terrible fixed price model (although it’s flat rate, not fixed hourly).",

One thing to keep in mind with a moving truck, it will not have much power, they don't care.  So on any kind of grade, especially towing your car, you WILL get passed on the uphill.  I have moved quite a few times in the last 8 years (LA to Detroit was 2200 miles, and Detroit to Portland, OR 2500 miles among others).  \n\nOne thing I'd say, and this comes down to YOUR comfort level, how do you feel about a 2 lane road compared to interstate?  \n\nThe bottom route diverts on to US 54, SW into Tucumcari, NM.  It's a well maintained road, but it is for most of the duration a 2 lane national highway.  You will be going through small to moderate towns and this will slow you down.  If you stay on I 35 South to Oklahoma City, then take I 40 west you will essentially be on the same route, but on the smoother, simpler interstate system.  The fun part of this is that theoretically, due to the higher speed limits, it's about the same time, at least for a car.  Depending on which company you've chosen, you may have a speed limiter in the truck.  I always chose Penske, and they limit to 70 MPH, so going on I 40 isn't faster, because the limit on that road is 75 MPH, but the limit on most of US 54 is 65 MPH.  \n\nI moved from Twin Cities to Phoenix in 2016, so I understand the fun you're going through, moving has it's challenges, but it's fun.  I'd also recommend you pre-plan and book your hotels in advance.  It gives you good points to make sure you stay on your schedule.\n\n## Comment ID lpfth54 with +1 score by [(timesuck47, Reddit, 2024-09-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/roadtrip/comments/1frh50p/easiest_drive_from_msp_to_la_with_moving_truck/lpfth54/) (in reply to ID 1frh50p):\nNOT through Colorado.\n\n## Comment ID lpg62m7 with +1 score by [(GearhedMG, Reddit, 2024-09-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/roadtrip/comments/1frh50p/easiest_drive_from_msp_to_la_with_moving_truck/lpg62m7/) (in reply to ID 1frh50p):\nAs a fellow Minnesotan that is now in the LA Metro Area, I would like to say welcome!

Dolly seems to specialize in delivering items from places that don't deliver like HomeGoods or Costco in-store items. Apparently you don't even have to wait there for them, you can buy the item and leave it there at the store and they will come and get it and deliver to your house. I was just wondering how reputable/reliable they are. There seems to be a few companies like them as well so if anyone has had any experience with them it would be helpful as well.\n\nAlso, I recently had surgery on my shoulder so renting a truck and doing it myself is out of the question.

Be careful if you decide to work for dolly and be reliant on it, they now terminate your account without any reason.",

Normally, doubling whatever a hands would make a week. In my case, suppose to be $1000-$1,400 a week! Once I became a helper, it was hard getting accepted for jobs. They pay started to slowly drop overtime. Then, out of nowhere, Dolly just became cheap. This caused me to cancel or not show up to certain jobs. Really have to think long and hard about doing the job before/ after accepting it. I truly don’t know what happened to Dolly. I was one of the first people to sign up and work with Dolly.

They don’t even have a number to reach if there is an immediate emergency (which more often than not, issues arise). You can leave a voicemail over phone then wait about 3 days for a response or send an email and again, wait some time to hear back. Not very helpful when in a pinch. \n\nThey used to pay well, now the wages are a joke for the drive time/work time combination (at least here in CA). Is $20 worth driving 25 miles each way to load and unload a couch worth it? With gas near 5 dollars a gallon, not so much. Sad part is they can afford to give their workers quite a bit more or actually pay for a support team!!\n\nWhat really irks me is that this company literally only has to pay the help (us) and their little bit of staff,  meaning they have very little overhead. Although, like all other companies in today’s world, they are greedy and could give a **** about the people actually doing the work.

One was a delivery route for The Container Store with 5 different deliveries all over L.A. it said there would be a tip for each delivery, but the tip was $0 for the whole route. It took 3.5 hours (locations were far apart) and paid $55. Used at least $20 in gas. One of the deliveries was to an $11 million dollar house in Beverly Hills. I don’t know if Dolly is pocketing the tips, or if there were really 0 out of 5 people that tipped. Either way it is less than minimum wage and not worth it. The 2nd Dolly I did was to move a dresser for $37. The dresser was very heavy and the location we delivered it to had a staircase that looked like it was designed by someone trying to make a staircase that was impossible to carry furniture up. It was the worst. After we finished, The client said they have had several delivery people just leave things at the bottom of the stairs and refuse to even try. Both of these jobs I knew would only be worth it when including a tip. Not one of them tipped. That 2nd client saw us laboring and dripping sweat and struggling to carry a heavy piece of furniture up the worst set of stairs. I have lost a little bit of my faith in humanity, my whole body hurts, and I’m never working Dolly again. You can make more money with Instacart or Uber Eats or anything but this. It’s not worth it. They need to pay more, or make the client tip beforehand like Postmates does. Then we can consider if we want to do the job. When you give people an option to tip after the service is provided, we apparently get screwed 6 out of 6 times. We aren’t waiters who should be tipped after providing good service with a smile. We are moving heavy things into small places and should know how much we are going to make beforehand. The tip should be made beforehand, and we can consider it when deciding whether or not to take the job.",

When you do this, you get paid LESS than when you register separately. This is a ploy to make more money for the company.

Sometimes they don’t respond at all. Decent money can be made but you’ll have to deal with the frustrations. Also, dolly posts pay rates low and only increases to what they are able to pay if no one takes the job. They make massive profits by lowballing us contractors.",

You are “own contractor “ but in the same time you have no rights or options to negotiate anything with the customers. Because they pay very low, once I needed a helper for one hour and try to hire one from Dolly. Usually they pay $30/hr, but at the end were asking me to pay more than $80/hr for one person. Do the calculations and think if it’s worth it even to open an account with them. I paid $25 fee, lost hours to complete the account and at the end, all it’s wasted. How someone will say that it’s easy to work with. Even if you bid for a job, most likely you won’t get it because they decide who will. If you do that, why don’t you just give it to the person you want. That’s why the moving companies have dispatch.",

      "# [Dolly Parton & Goddaughter Miley Cyrus Are Related by Blood, Ancestry Reveals by Hannah Dailey on 2024-09-24](https://www.billboard.com/culture/lifestyle/dolly-parton-miley-cyrus-related-ancestry-1235782690/)\nAs Dolly Parton‘s goddaughter, Miley Cyrus was already part of the country legend’s family — but according to new research from Ancestry.com, the pair also share a family tree.\n\nThe genealogy-tracking website revealed Monday (Sept. 23) that the 78-year-old country legend and 31-year-old pop star are distantly related, with the pair connected by a man named John Brickey. Born in 1740, Brickey was a Tennessee resident who lived about 20 miles away from what is now Parton’s theme park, Dollywood, before he died in 1806.\n\nBrickey is apparently Parton’s sixth great-grandfather and Cyrus’ seventh great-grandfather, making the two women seventh cousins, once removed.\n\n“Is that true? That’s amazing!” the “Jolene” singer reacted to the news during an interview with Access Hollywood posted Monday. “We’re so close, Miley and I. I would’ve thought we’d have been at least third cousins, 10 times removed. I’m sure she’ll get a kick out of that.”\n\n“It doesn’t surprise me because she does feel like family,” Parton added of the “Flowers” artist.\n\nThe revelation makes for timely news as Parton’s new album Dolly Parton & Family: Smoky Mountain DNA – Family, Faith & Fables, is set to arrive in November. The expansive project will revolve around the icon’s paternal and maternal ancestral lines settling in the Smoky Mountain area and feature performances from loved ones representing multiple generations of Parton’s family.\n\nParton is also planning an accompanying docuseries of the same title investigating her family’s history, featuring performances filmed at Knoxville’s Bijou Theater.\n\nThe “9 to 5” musician and Cyrus have long been close, both as friends and collaborators. The former appeared a couple times as the latter’s “Aunt Dolly” on episodes of Disney Channel’s Hannah Montana, and the duo recently teamed up for a reimagined duet of Cyrus’ hit “Wrecking Ball” for Parton’s 2023 album, Rockstar. That same year, they cohosted Miley’s New Year’s Eve Party for NBC.",

These are my valleys. These are my rivers flowing like a stream. These are my people.\"\n\nParton grew up in nearby Sevierville, Tennessee, home of her Dollywood theme park.\n\nRELATED: New NOAA maps show street-by-street views of Hurricane Helene's destruction\n\nParton said she’s personally donating $1 million to the Mountain Ways Foundation, a nonprofit working to help Helene victims recover from devastating flood damage in eastern Tennessee, western North Carolina and the greater Appalachia region.\n\nRELATED: Grandparents found hugging each other after fallen tree killed them during Hurricane Helene\n\nHer other businesses, including Dollywood Parks & Resorts, Dolly Parton’s Stampede and Pirates Voyage Dinner & Show, are also donating $1 million, bringing the total donation to $2 million.\n\nParton also took the time to sing for the crowd, adapting her hit song \"Jolene\" to \"Helene\" and changing the lyrics to, \"You came in here and broke us all apart.\"\n\nRELATED: Asheville shelter saves 100 pets from Helene's floods but more help is needed\n\nThe death toll soared to 215 people on Thursday as more victims were found, making Helene the deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina in 2005. Roughly half the victims were in North Carolina, while dozens more were killed in South Carolina and Georgia. How many people are missing or unaccounted for isn’t clear.\n\n\"It’s personal because I have a lot of my own relatives that live here, and when we heard about this it was devastating, not just because it was my family, because all these people feel like my people,\" Parton said. \"We all feel related, and we are in some sort of way … you don’t want to see anybody suffering. I was heartbroken like everybody else, just amazed and devastated.\"\n\nRELATED: Dolly Parton is sending free books to children across 21 states — and worldwide\n\nNow a week since the storm first roared onto Florida’s Gulf Coast, the search has continued for people who have yet to be heard from in places where phone service and electricity were knocked out. Pleas for help are coming from people running low on medicine or in need of fuel for their generators.\n\n\"We are with you, we love you, we hope that things get better real soon,\" Parton assured the crowd.",

Inspired by her life and career, \"Hello, I'm Dolly\" will come to Broadway in 2026 with music and lyrics by Parton, a statement on the show's website said.\n\nAlthough the icon has been in the public eye for decades, this will be the first musical produced about her life. The singer announced during the CMA Fest in Nashville that the show will have \"many original songs\" and that she's included all the fan favorites in the score. \"You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll clap, you'll stomp, it truly is a Grand Ol' Opera. Pun and fun intended. Don't miss it,\" Parton said.\n\nParton, 78, shows no signs of slowing down. Last year she garnered three new Guinness World Records for her musical achievements, bringing her total to 10 world records. Her awards include the record for the longest span of No.1 hits for a female artist on the U.S. Top Country Albums chart, covering more than 43 years, and most studio albums released by a female country singer.",

Not only do the two share a spiritual connection, they’re also seventh cousins, once removed, according to the genealogy-tracking service.\n\nCyrus and Parton both share a common ancestor in John Brickey, who was born in Virginia in 1740 and later moved to Blount County, Tennessee, where he died in 1806 at age 66. As Billboard noted, Brickey made his home just 20 miles away from the modern-day site of Parton’s Dollywood theme park and resort. Parton is descended from Brickey’s daughter Mary, while Cyrus traces her lineage back through his other daughter, Elizabeth.\n\n“Is that true? That’s amazing!” exclaimed Parton when surprised with the news in an Access Hollywood interview this week. “Well, we’re so close, Miley and I, I would’ve thought we’d have been at least third cousins 10 times removed,” she quipped. “I’m sure she’ll get a kick out of that. But it doesn’t surprise me, because she does feel like family.”\n\nParton legendarily played “Aunt Dolly” on the Disney Channel show Hannah Montana, which catapulted Cyrus to child stardom. The two remained close long after the show’s end, sharing Southern comfort food and popular music stardom in equal measure, even covering one another’s most recognizable hits — Cyrus with her “Backyard Sessions” cover of the iconic “Jolene,” and Parton more recently with her take on “Wrecking Ball” (which still featured Cyrus on backing vocals) on Cyrus’ 2023 album Rockstar.\n\n“Dolly wrote to me to say: “How much do I love you? As much as my heart can hold and as far as my arms can reach.” It gets me choked up. I just love her so much,” Cyrus told W magazine earlier this summer.\n\nThis latest news can only bring the pop star duo closer together — if that’s even possible.",

Along with the 37-track project, Parton also plans to premiere a four-part docuseries tracing her musical lineage.\n\n“I cannot believe that it has been 60 years this month since I graduated from Sevier County High School and moved to Nashville to pursue my dreams,” Parton previously shared in a statement. “My Uncle Bill Owens was by my side for many years helping me develop my music.

I just love her so much.”\n\nIn a tribute to Parton after she was named to Time magazine's 100 most influential people of 2021, Cyrus described Parton as her \"idol because of her incomparable career\" and her \"role model because of her steadfast morals and values.”\n\nWhen Cyrus was starring on \"Hannah Montana,\" her godmother made a few guest appearances on the show and played her aunt.\n\n“I remember when she came in to do a table read for Hannah Montana in all her bedazzled glory,” Cyrus wrote in an essay for Time. “Her smell, the way her nails tapped the table, the sound it made when she flipped the pages of the script—I could see that she fascinated other people too. A living fantasy was in front of all of us.”\n\nThe singers also teamed up for a TV special called “Miley’s New Year’s Eve Party” in 2022. At the time, Cyrus spoke to TODAY about their bond.\n\n“People are going to be affected by the show. There’s a chemistry, and a realness, and a love, and a connection that her and I have that I really feel,” she said.",
      "# [Dolly Parton Learns She's Actually Related to Goddaughter Miley Cyrus: 'Is That True? That's Amazing!' by Jack Irvin, www.facebook.com on 2024-09-24](https://people.com/dolly-parton-is-actually-related-to-goddaughter-miley-cyrus-8717819)\nThe Cyrus family tree branches out further than anyone knew!\n\nThis week, Ancestry revealed Dolly Parton and her goddaughter, Miley Cyrus, are actually related by blood. The country icon found out the news during an interview with Access Hollywood — and she was delighted!\n\n\"Dolly Parton and Miley Cyrus are seventh cousins, once removed! Their common ancestor is John Brickey, born in 1740 in Virginia,\" reads a statement from Ancestry.\n\nThe company added of Brickey, \"He later moved to Blount County, Tennessee with his wife and children and remained there until his death in 1806. The Brickey family originated from France and the family came to the United States in the late 1600s.\" [Both Parton and Cyrus are from Tennessee.]\n\nParton, 78, was promoting her new cookbook, Good Lookin' Cookin, co-authored by her sister, Rachel, on Access Hollywood when she was presented with the information.\n\n\"Is that true? That's amazing!\" exclaimed the \"Jolene\" musician, before joking about the distant relation: \"Well, we're so close, Miley and I. I would've thought we would've been at least third cousins, 10 times removed.\"\n\nShe continued of Cyrus, 31, \"I’m sure she'll get a kick out of that, but it doesn’t surprise me because she does feel like family.\"\n\nThe \"I Will Always Love You\" singer-songwriter's status as Cyrus' godmother stems from her close relationship with the former Hannah Montana star's father, Billy Ray. \"I've known her since she was a baby,\" said Parton in a 2009 interview with ABC News.\n\n\"When she was born, [her father] said, ‘You just have to be her godmother,’ and I said, ‘I accept,'\" she recalled at the time. \"We never did do a big ceremony, but I’m so proud of her, love her. And she’s just like one of my own.\"\n\nThe godmother-goddaughter duo have maintained a tight-knit relationship over the years. During a June appearance on Netflix's My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman, Miley revealed Parton was part of the reason her show-stopping performance of \"Flowers\" at the 2024 Grammy Awards even happened.\n\n\"A tough conversation I had with her: I told her, ‘I’m wondering if I’m going to do the Grammys or not.’ And she said, ‘Well of course you’re going to do the Grammys, and you’re not just going to show up but you’re going to show off. And you’re going to be everything that you are sitting right here in front of me,'\" she reflected.",
      "# [Miley Cyrus and Dolly Parton are apparently distant relatives by Alli Rosenbloom on 2024-09-23](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/23/entertainment/miley-cyrus-dolly-parton-related-ancestry/index.html)\nDolly Parton has learned her special connection with goddaughter Miley Cyrus is even deeper than she originally thought.\n\nGenealogy and family tree tracking site Ancestry announced on Monday that by using “billions of historical records and public family trees,” they’ve discovered that the two music powerhouses are actually seventh cousins, once removed.\n\nTheir common ancestor is a man named John Brickey, who was born in Virginia in 1740, according to Ancestry. Brickey is Parton’s sixth great-grandfather and Cyrus’ seventh great-grandfather.\n\n“We’re so close, Miley and I. I’d have thought we’d have been at least third cousins,” Parton said on Monday’s episode of Access Hollywood, reacting to the revelation. “It doesn’t surprise me because she does feel like family.”\n\nParton is Cyrus’ godmother and previously appeared on several episodes of the Disney Channel show “Hannah Montana” playing Cyrus’ aunt.\n\nThe pair have always been vocal about their closeness, something Cyrus touched on in a tribute to Parton that she penned for Time Magazine’s 100 Most Influential People of 2021.\n\n“Dolly is not only my idol because of her incomparable career—she’s also my role model because of her steadfast morals and values,” Cyrus wrote. “She recognizes how impactful her choices will be as one of the most iconic and powerful voices in country music, and she leaves no one behind.”\n\nThe timing of this news is poignant considering Parton is gearing up to release her new family-centric album “Dolly Parton & Family: Smoky Mountain DNA – Family, Faith & Fables” in November.",

These are my rivers flowing like a stream… These are my people and this is my home.”\n\nShe continued, “Remember when we had the fires, everybody pitched in, tried to do everything that they could. And so I really think that this is a time for me to step up again for all of us to step up and do what we can. Today, I wanted to announce that from myself personally just from my own bank account, I’m donating a million dollars today, but there’s a lot to be done, and we’re trying to find other ways to even raise more funds.”\n\nIn addition to Parton’s personal donation, the singer announced that through her business enterprises — Dollywood Parks & Resorts, Dolly Parton’s Stampede and Pirates Voyage Dinner & Show, and the Dollywood Foundation — another $1 million donation will be matched and made to the Mountain Ways Foundation nonprofit.\n\n“But also with my Dollywood companies and all the people I’m involved with… we’ve added another million dollars to that $1 million so we’re starting out with a good little chunk and like I said we’re trying to find other new ways to make money cause it’s going to take a lot of money, as you know. And it’s going to take a long time. There’s still so much more to do.”\n\n“I am totally with you because I am part of you. I love you,” Parton said.\n\nThe donation marks another philanthropic effort from the legendary country singer. In 2020, Parton donated $1 million toward vaccine research at Vanderbilt University, which aided in funding Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine.",
      "# [Miley Cyrus and Dolly Parton aren’t just like family — they are blood relatives by Amy Hubbard, Amy Hubbard Deputy Editor, Fast Break Desk, www.latimes.com, amy-hubbard on 2024-09-25](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2024-09-25/miley-cyrus-dolly-parton-cousins-godmother)\nThis makes perfect sense.\n\nMiley Cyrus’ fiery godmother, Dolly Parton, is her seventh cousin, once removed.\n\nThe news was sprung on the country music legend during an interview with “Access Hollywood” about the cookbook she created with her sister, “Good Lookin’ Cookin’: A Year of Meals.”\n\nWhich sister? Not Willadeene, Stella or Cassie but one of the twins — not Freida but Rachel. Along with her five sisters, Parton also has six brothers. The family tree is so large it rivals General Sherman.\n\n“Is that true?! That’s amazin’!,” Parton said when presented with the Ancestry.com findings about her link to Cyrus.\n\nCyrus and Parton’s mutual ancestor, John Brickey, lived in Tennessee’s Blunt County not far from where Dollywood is today, Access Hollywood revealed.\n\nParton said she wasn’t surprised, because Cyrus had always felt like family (Cyrus and scores of others).\n\n“I’m sure she’ll get a kick out of that,” Parton said.\n\nCyrus has often praised her godmother. She told W magazine in a June interview, “Dolly’s been like a mother to me.” She noted that Parton sent her a fax two Mother’s Days ago. (Why a fax? Because: 78 years old.)\n\nCyrus, who doesn’t have a fax machine handy, said she has to pick up faxes at her lawyer’s office.\n\nDolly’s message was: “How much do I love you? As much as my heart can hold and as far as my arms can reach.”\n\nWhich got Cyrus choked up — as it would anyone lucky enough to have a godmother with a heart as big as her hair.",
      "# [Dolly Parton is sending free books to children across 21 states — and around the world by HEATHER HOLLINGSWORTH, BRUCE SCHREINER on 2024-08-27](https://apnews.com/article/dolly-parton-children-books-states-program-5aa502c1905babd9604e9b3588942995)\nDolly Parton’s father grew up poor and never got the chance to learn to read.\n\nInspired by her upbringing, the 78-year-old country music legend has made it her mission over the past three decades to improve literacy through her Imagination Library book giveaway program. It has expanded statewide in places like Missouri and Kentucky, two of 21 states where all children under the age of 5 can enroll to have books mailed to their homes monthly.\n\nTo celebrate, she made stops Tuesday in both states to promote the program and tell the story of her father, Robert Lee Parton, who died in 2000.\n\n“In the mountains, a lot of people never had a chance to go to school because they had to work on the farms,” she said at the Folly Theater in Kansas City, Missouri. “They had to do whatever it took to keep the rest of the family going.”\n\nParton, the fourth of 12 children from a poor Appalachian family, said her father was “one of the smartest people I’ve ever known,” but he was embarrassed that he couldn’t read.\n\nAnd so she decided to help other kids, initially rolling out the program in a single county in her home state of Tennessee in 1995. It spread quickly from there, and today over 3 million books are sent out each month. Since the program started, books have been sent to more than 240 million to kids in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia.\n\nMissouri covers the full cost of the program, which totaled $11 million in the latest fiscal year. Most of the other states chip in money through a cost-sharing model.\n\n“The kids started calling me the ‘book lady,’” Parton said. “And Daddy was more proud of that than he was that I was a star. But Daddy got to feeling like he had really done something great as well.”\n\nIn Kentucky, the Imagination Library reaches children in all 120 counties, Gov. Andy Beshear said at an event Tuesday with Parton. More than 120,000 Kentucky children — nearly half of all preschoolers in the state — are currently enrolled to receive books through the program, first lady Britainy Beshear said.\n\nIt encourages families to read together, and it allows children to have their own personal library before starting kindergarten, at no cost to their families, the first lady said.\n\n“It’s really a great way to teach children when they’re very young to learn to love books and to learn to read,” Parton said during the event in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nParton, who earned the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award a decade ago, said she eventually wants to see the program in every state. While there is a presence in all of them, 21 have legislation ensuring all kids under 5 can enroll. She said she is proud that her dad lived long enough to see the program get off the ground.\n\n“That was kind of my way to honor my dad, because the Bible says to honor your father and mother,” she said. “And I don’t think that just means, ‘just obey.’ I think it means to bring honor to their name and to them.”\n\nParton is an author herself whose titles include the 1996 children’s book “Coat of Many Colors,” which is part of the book giveaway program.\n\nAs she prepared to sing her famous song by the same name, she explained that it is about a coat her mother made her from a patchwork of mismatched fabric, since the family was too poor to afford a large piece of a single fabric. Parton was proud of it because her mother likened it the multicolored coat that is told about in the Bible — a fantastic gift from Jacob to his son Joseph.\n\nClassmates, however, laughed at her. For years, she said the experience was a “deep, deep hurt.”\n\nShe said that with writing and performing the song, “the hurt just left me.” She received letters over the years from people saying it did the same thing for them.\n\n“The fact,” she explained, “that that little song has just meant so much not only to me, but to so many other people for so many different reasons, makes it my favorite song.”\n\nAsked in Kentucky about her lasting legacy, Parton said she’d like to be remembered as “a good ole girl” who worked hard and tried to make people happy and the world a better place.\n\n“Of course I want to be known as a songwriter and a singer, but I honestly can say that the Imagination Library has meant as much, if not more, to me than nearly anything that I’ve ever done,” she said.\n\n___\n\nHollingsworth reported from Mission, Kansas.
