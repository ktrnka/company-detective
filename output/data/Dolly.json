      "# [Terms of Service](https://dolly.com/terms)\nDolly Terms of Service\n\nLast Revised: January 4, 2024\n\nPLEASE READ THESE LEGALLY BINDING DOLLY TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY, INCLUDING ANY LINKED TERMS (COLLECTIVELY âTERMSâ) BEFORE ACCESSING OR USING ANY COMPONENT OF THE DOLLY PLATFORM OR ANY RELATED PRODUCTS, SERVICES, OR CONTENT.\n\nThis is a legal agreement between Dolly, Inc. (\"Dolly,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\") and the individual that downloads, accesses, installs or uses any aspect of the Dolly Platform (defined below) (âyouâ or âyourâ) whether or not such downloading, access, installation, or use is direct (or indirect via a third-party who downloads, accesses, installs or uses the Dolly Platform on your behalf ). Dolly and you are each deemed a âPartyâ or the âPartiesâ to these Terms.\n\nThe Dolly Platform connects you with service providers (each, a \"Helper\") whom you can engage via the Dolly Platform to move your stuff to an agreed location specified by you.\n\nThese Terms apply to any access and/or use of the Dolly mobile application (the \"App\"), the www.Dolly.com website (or the related Dolly domains, including book.dolly.com) (the \"Site(s)\") and any other products and services Dolly makes available to you via its App or its Site(s), including the updates and upgrades of any of the forgoing that are provided to you during the term (collectively, the \"Dolly Platform\").\n\nFor more information about the Dolly Platform, please see our Customer Knowledge Base.\n\nAccepting these Terms\n\nBY DOWNLOADING THE APP, ACCESSING THE SITE(S) OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE MADE AVAILABLE VIA THE APP OR THE SITE(S) OR ANY COMPONENT OF THE DOLLY PLATFORM (OR BY ALLOWING A THIRD PARTY TO ACCESS OR USE THE DOLLY PLATFORM ON YOUR BEHALF OR FOR YOUR BENEFIT), YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS WITH RESPECT TO THE DOLLY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COVERED BY THESE TERMS. Please read all the terms before you directly (or indirectly) access or use (or have a third-party access or use) any component of the Dolly Platform on your behalf or for your benefit. If a term does not make sense to you, please let us know. If you don't agree to these Terms, you may not access or use (or ask a third party to access or use) the Dolly Platform on your behalf or for your benefit.\n\nModifications\n\nYou represent and warrant that you will review these Terms prior to making a Request and that any continued access or use of the Dolly Platform is subject to the then current Terms posted at the time of your access or use.\n\nWe reserve the right to change these Terms from time to time. The Terms applicable to you are the Terms in place when you access or use the Dolly Platform. If we make changes to the Terms, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of these Terms and, in some cases, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification).\n\nWe encourage you to review the Terms regularly, and prior to initiating any new Request on the Dolly Platform so that you are aware of the most current Terms which will apply at the time of your access or usage. If you do not agree to the Terms effective at the time of access or usage, then you should discontinue all use of the Dolly Platform.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFor information about how we collect, use and share information about users of the Dolly Platform, please see our Privacy Policy at http://dolly.com/privacy.\n\nDescription of the Dolly Platform\n\nThrough the Dolly Platform, you can submit a request (a \"Request\") for a Helper to pick up the item(s) you specify (each, an \"Item\") for loading, unloading, moving, hauling, packing, lifting, assembly or disassembly (the \"Services\"). You will receive a price quote for the fee that will apply to completing your Request for the Services (the \"Services Fee\"). Once you submit the payment information to cover the Service Fee for the Request, your Request will be sent out to our network of Helpers. You will receive a notification through the Dolly Platform when a Helper has accepted your Request and agrees to provide the Services, and you will be able to communicate with that Helper through the Dolly Platform to confirm and coordinate certain logistics involved with completing your Request.\n\nYou represent and warrant that the Items related to any Request are your personal property or that you have the requisite permissions, consents, and rights to make the Request of the Helper to perform the Services in relation to the Items specified in the Request and that completing the Services in relation to the Items identified in the Request will not result in the violation of any laws, regulations, contracts or agreements to which you are bound, or third party's rights of any kind.\n\nCreating Accounts\n\nWhen you create an account you must maintain the security of your password. If you discover or suspect that someone is accessing your account without your permission or has obtained your password or that there is any Dolly Platform security breaches, please let us know as soon as possible. You represent and warrant to us that all information that you provide in connection with your account is accurate, truthful, current and complete. Dolly reserves the right to deny any account at our discretion.\n\nPayment for Services\n\nYou must provide credit card information to submit a Request. You are responsible for paying the applicable Services Fee for any completed Services. Once you submit a Request, we will place a temporary hold on the credit card account you provided in an amount equal to 100% of the applicable Services Fee. Once you and the Helper have verified that the Services are completed, you will have the option of paying an additional gratuity (a \"Tip\") to the Helper, and your credit card account will be charged for the sum of the Services Fee, any Tip, and the fees for any additional services you may request.\n\nYou agree to make all payments to the Helper through the Dolly Platform and will not pay any Helper in cash or means other than directly through the Dolly Platform.\n\nCanceling a Request\n\nIf you cancel any Request before a Helper accepts it you will not be charged and the hold will be lifted on your credit card. If you cancel any Request after a Helper accepts it, your credit card account may be charged up to 100% of the applicable Services Fee as set forth in Dolly's cancellation policy.\n\nRight to Use the Dolly Platform; Certain Restrictions\n\nOn the condition that you fully comply with these Terms, Dolly grants you a limited, nonexclusive, non-transferable and revocable license to access and use the Dolly Platform for your own personal, non-commercial use.\n\nHowever, with respect to access and use of the App, you represent and warrant that you will only download and access the App on mobile devices that you own or control or that you have express permission to use.\n\nThese Terms will govern your access and use of any upgrades provided by Dolly that replace and/or supplement the original App, Site(s), or other components of the Dolly Platform. If a Dolly product or service is not covered by these Terms, then it will be accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern.\n\nYou may not (and you may not authorize any other party to) (a) modify, disclose, alter, translate or create derivative works of the Dolly Platform, (b) license, sublicense, resell, distribute, lease, rent, lend, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of the Dolly Platform, (c) disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer any of the software components of the Dolly Platform, (d) copy, frame or mirror any part of the Dolly Platform, (e) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Dolly Platform, or (f) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Dolly Platform or its related systems or networks. The restrictions stated herein apply to any and all components or parts of the Dolly Platform, including the App, Site(s), or any software that comprises any of the components of the Dolly Platform.\n\nProhibited Use of the Dolly Platform\n\nYou may not post or otherwise make available on or through the Dolly Platform any of the following:\n\nPrivate information of any other persons (including names, email addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers and financial information);\n\nContent or information that is false, fraudulent or intended to be misleading;\n\nContent that is libelous, defamatory, abusive, offensive or hateful;\n\nContent that is obscene, pornographic, indecent or sexually explicit, depicts graphic, excessive or gratuitous violence;\n\nContent that is illegal, harmful or offensive or that would encourage, solicit, foster, glorify or provide instructions for any criminal or civil offense;\n\nContent that may infringe, misappropriate or violate any intellectual property rights, rights of privacy, rights of publicity or any other rights of others;\n\nViruses, corrupted data or other harmful, disruptive or destructive files or code;\n\nContent that, in Dolly's judgment, is objectionable, may restrict or inhibit another from enjoying the Dolly Platform or may expose Dolly or users of the Dolly Platform to harm or liability of any type; and/or\n\nContent that you are contractually or legally required to keep confidential.\n\nAlso, you may not do any of the following in connection with the Dolly Platform (or any component thereof) or other users, each as applicable:\n\nUse the Dolly Platform in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Dolly Platform or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the Dolly Platform;\n\nEngage in phishing scams using any component of the Dolly Platform\n\nCollect any personal information about other users;\n\nIntimidate, threaten, stalk, bully or otherwise harass other users;\n\nPost spam or commercial messages through any component of Dolly Platform;\n\nCreate an account or submit a Request if you are not over 13 years of age;\n\nUse the Dolly Platform for any illegal or unauthorized purpose or to engage in, encourage or promote any activity that is unlawful or that violates these Terms; or\n\nDisable or circumvent or attempt to circumvent any access control or related process or procedure, filtering, security measures, rate limits or other features designed to protect the Dolly Platform, its users, or third parties.\n\nRelease, publish, and/or otherwise make available to any third party the results of any performance or functional evaluation of any component of the Dolly Platform without the prior written approval of Dolly;\n\nAlter or remove any proprietary notices or legends contained on or in the Dolly Platform components.\n\nAccess or use (or attempt to access or use) another user's account without permission, or solicit another user's login information, or make any attempts to access accounts or information not part of your account without permission;\n\nâFrameâ or âmirrorâ any portion of the online components of the Dolly Platform;\n\nUse any robot, spider, site search/retrieval application or other manual or automatic device or process to retrieve, index, âdata mineâ or in any way reproduce or circumvent the navigational structure or presentation of the Dolly Platform components; and\n\nProbe, scan or test the vulnerability of the online components of the Dolly Platform, nor breach the security or authentication measures of the component of the Dolly Platform or take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on the infrastructure of the online components of the Dolly Platform, such as a denial of service attack.\n\nYour use of the Dolly Platform is at your own risk. You are responsible and liable for the content of your Requests, your interaction with the Helpers and any other user of the Dolly Platform. You agree that Dolly is not responsible or liable for the content of your Requests, your actions, the conduct of, or your interactions with, Helpers or any other users (whether online or offline) or for any related damage or harm. As a mere provider of interactive services, Dolly is not liable for the content of any Requests or responses obtained in connection with making a Request. Although we have no obligation to screen, edit or monitor Requests or responses to Requests, we reserve the right, and have the discretion, to screen, edit or remove your or any Helper&s access to any component of the Dolly Platform or to remove any Requests at any time, for any reason and without notice.\n\nDisputes between You and a Helper; Disclaimers\n\nThe Dolly Platform is merely a neutral means of connecting you with Helpers. We are not responsible or liable for you, your actions (or inactions), your Requests, or for the Helpers, the Helper&s responses or actions (or inactions), the Services, or for the Items which are the subject of the requested Services. As a condition of allowing your access or usage of the Dolly Platform to connect with Helpers, you agree to forgo and waive any claim or suit against us and to release us from any liability, loss, damages, or harm (a) caused by the Helpers or their Services (or their failure to provide adequate services); (b) relating to the Items or the handling of Items (subject to any Damage Protection outlined below); and (c) to persons or to property (personal or real) associated with Request or the delivery of Services (or failure to deliver Services).\n\nWe provide no warranty or assurance of any kind that any Helper you engage will meet your expectations or will follow your instructions in performing any Services or not cause harm or damage to your Items or to other property or persons. Any dispute that you may have with the Helper regarding the performance of any Services (or the Items which are the subject of the Services), including any dispute related to the time, place, and manner of performing, is between you and the applicable Helper. Dolly is not responsible for the replacement or repair of any of any Item or for damage, loss or harm to any other personal or real property that may be damaged by a Helper while performing the Services.\n\nPlease report any suspected illegal or unethical behavior by a Helper during the performance of any Services to: [email protected].\n\nReporting and Removal\n\nDolly users may report content to Dolly that they think violates these Terms, and Dolly may remove such content, suspend or terminate the account of the user who posted or otherwise made available such content and/or take additional action to enforce these Terms against such user.\n\nAlso, in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and other applicable law, users may report infringement of their intellectual property, and Dolly will follow the processes outlined in the DMCA to address any reported infringement.\n\nIf you believe that anything on the Dolly Platform infringes upon any copyright that you own or control, you may file a notification with Dolly's Designated Agent as set forth below:\n\nDesignated Agent: Dolly, Inc.\n\nAddress of Designated Agent: 9450 SW Gemini Dr., PMB 43895, Beaverton, Oregon 97008-7105\n\nEmail Address of Designated Agent: [email protected]\n\nFax Number of Designated Agent: 206-494-3198\n\nPhone number of Designated Agent: 206-494-3198\n\nPlease see 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) for the requirements of a proper notification. If you knowingly misrepresent in your notification that the material or activity is infringing, you may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred by Dolly or the alleged infringer as the result of Dolly relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing.\n\nDolly may also at its sole discretion limit access to the Dolly Platform or terminate the accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement. Additionally, Dolly has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at Dolly's sole discretion, subscribers or account holders who are deemed to be repeat infringers.\n\nDolly's Rights\n\nAs between you and Dolly, all information, materials and content of the Dolly Platform, including text, graphics, data, formatting, graphs, designs, HTML, look and feel, photographs, music, sounds, images, software, videos, designs, typefaces, source and object code, format, queries, algorithms and other content is owned by Dolly or is used with permission.

Dolly reserves all rights not expressly set forth in these Terms. You hereby irrevocably waive in favor of Dolly any and all moral rights that you may possess in or to any Requests.\n\nFeedback\n\nAny suggestions, comments or other feedback you give us about the Dolly Platform (the \"Feedback\") will constitute our confidential information. We are free to use, disclose, reproduce, license, distribute and exploit this Feedback as we see fit, without compensation to you or any obligation or restriction because of any intellectual property rights or otherwise.\n\nLocation Information\n\nThe Dolly Platform collects location information and it will be used and disclosed as set forth in the Privacy Policy at https://dolly.com/privacy.\n\nBy accepting these Terms or using the App, the Site(s), or any component of the Dolly Platform, you affirmatively consent to Dolly's collection, use, disclosure and storage of your location information. You may revoke your consent with respect to Dolly's collection, use, disclosure and storage of your location information at any time by deleting the App from your mobile device, or by changing the privacy settings on your mobile device.

WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS OR REQUIREMENTS.\n\nLimitation of Liability\n\nTO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL DOLLY BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF DATA, PROPERTY (PERSONAL OR PROPERTY), PHYSICAL LOSSES, DEATH, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS, THE DOLLY PLATFORM (INCLUDING THE APP, THE SITE(S), OR RELATED PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR CONTENT, INCLUDING REQUESTS AND RESPONSES TO REQUESTS, HELPERS ACTIONS OR INACTIONS, SERVICES PERFORMED OR NOT PERFORMED BY HELPERS, AND/OR THIRD-PARTY SERVICES OR MATERIALS, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, WHETHER ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR IMPUTED), PRODUCT LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY) AND EVEN IF DOLLY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nSOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\nFOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT EXCLUDED UNDER THESE TERMS, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF DOLLY AND ITS DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AFFILIATES AND INVESTORS WILL NOT EXCEED TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS ($200).\n\nTHESE LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION WILL APPLY ONLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE UNDER LAWS APPLICABLE TO YOU (INCLUDING WHERE RELEVANT THE APPLICABLE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS).\n\nIndemnification\n\nYou will defend us from and against any actual or threatened suits, actions, proceedings (at law or in equity), and claims, and indemnify us for any and all damages, payments, deficiencies, fines, judgments, settlements, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, penalties, interest, and disbursements) arising from or related to any of your Requests and your conduct with respect to the Dolly Platform, requesting or obtaining Services, or your violation (or alleged violation) of these Terms or the rights of any third party by you or any person using your Dolly account.\n\nThird Party Software\n\nThe software you may download (if relevant) consists of a package of components, including certain third party software provided under separate third party license terms. Your use of this third party software in conjunction with the App in a manner consistent with the terms of these Terms is permitted, however, you may have broader rights under the applicable third-party license terms, and nothing in these Terms is intended to impose further restrictions on your use of this third-party software.\n\nChanges to the Dolly Platform\n\nDolly reserves the right in our discretion to review, improve, change or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Sites, the App, components of the Dolly Platform and/or any features, information, materials or content available on the Dolly Platform with or without providing notice to you. Dolly will not be liable to you or any third party for any changes or discontinuance of the Sites, the App, the Dolly Platform (or any part of the Dolly Platform) and/or any features, information, materials or content available on the Dolly Platform.\n\nConsent to Electronic Communications\n\nBy using the Dolly Platform, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding your use of the Dolly Platform and that any notices, agreements, disclosures or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that the communications be in writing. To withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice, please notify us at [email protected].\n\nSuspension and Termination\n\nDolly may suspend or terminate your rights to access or use any and all aspects of the Dolly Platform (including the App) for any reason or for no reason at all and with or without notice at Dolly's discretion. All of the terms of these Terms (excluding the license grant) will survive any termination or suspension.\n\nGoverning Law; Arbitration\n\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH DOLLY AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM DOLLY.\n\nThese Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington and the United States of America, without resort to any conflict of law provisions.\n\nIn the event of any controversy or claim between the Parties, arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms and the subject matter covered by these Terms, you and Dolly agree to consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing your mutual interests, try to reach a solution satisfactory to both parties. If we do not reach settlement within a period of 60 days, then either of us may, by notice to the other demand mediation under the mediation rules of the American Arbitration Association in Seattle, Washington. We both give up our right to litigate our disputes and may not proceed to arbitration without first trying mediation, but you and Dolly are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief from the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Dolly will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.\n\nIf settlement is not reached within 60 days after service of a written demand for mediation, any unresolved controversy or claim will be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association before a single arbitrator in Seattle, Washington. The language of all proceedings and filings will be English. The arbitrator will render a written opinion including findings of fact and law and the award and/or determination of the arbitrator will be binding on the parties, and their respective administrators and assigns, and will not be subject to appeal. Judgment may be entered upon the award of the arbitrator in any court of competent jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration will be shared equally by the parties unless the arbitration determines that the expenses will be otherwise assessed and the prevailing party may be awarded its attorneys' fees and expenses by the arbitrator. It is the intent of the parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances, arbitration proceedings will be concluded within 90 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit only if failure to do so would unduly prejudice the rights of the parties. Failure to adhere to this time limit will not constitute a basis for challenging the award. Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, pre-hearing information exchange will be limited to the reasonable production of relevant, non-privileged documents, carried out expeditiously.\n\nFor any disputes between the Parties that are not handled by arbitration, you agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms and/or the subject matter covered by these Terms shall be filed only in the state and federal courts located in Seattle, Washington and the Parties each hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding between the Parties arising out of or relating these Terms and/or the subject matter covered by these Terms.\n\nGeneral\n\nEnforcement of these Terms is solely at Dolly's discretion. Failure to enforce any part of these Terms in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce the same or other part of these Terms in other instances.\n\nIf any provision of these Terms is or becomes unlawful, void or otherwise unenforceable (including the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations above), then that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.\n\nThe section headings of these Terms are for reference purposes only and will not affect the meaning or interpretation of these Terms.\n\nThese Terms (and terms or policies incorporated herein) make up the entire agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter covered herein, including access and use of Dolly Platform, Requests, and the Services, and they supersede any other terms, whether implied or expressed.\n\nContact Us\n\nIf you have any questions about these Terms, please email us at [email protected] or send a letter to:\n\nDolly, Inc.\n\n9450 SW Gemini Dr., PMB 43895\n\nBeaverton, Oregon 97008-7105\n\nNotice for California Users\n\nIf you are a California resident, you may have these Terms mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to the address above with your electronic mail address and a request for these Terms. Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California Website users are entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 1625 N. Market Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.\n\nNotice Regarding Apple\n\nApple, Inc. and Other Third-Party Beneficiaries. You acknowledge and agree that Apple, Inc. (\"Apple\") and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and further that (a) upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party; (b) these Terms are conducted between you and Dolly only, and not Apple; (c) Dolly, and not Apple, is solely responsible for the Dolly Platform and the content thereof provided by Dolly; (d) Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Dolly Platform; (e) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no warranty obligation with respect to the Dolly Platform; and Dolly, and not Apple, will be responsible for any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure of the Dolly Platform to conform to any applicable warranty; (f) in the event of any third party claim that the Dolly Platform or your possession and use of that Dolly Platform infringes that third party's intellectual property rights, Apple will not be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim; and (g) Apple will not be responsible for addressing any of your claims or any third party claims relating to the Dolly Platform or your possession and/or use of the Dolly Platform, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Dolly Platform fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.\n\nNotice Regarding Damage Protection\n\nPlease note that Damage Protection only applies to the goods being transported. It does not protect damage to the environment surrounding the Dolly (e.g. floors, walls, ceiling, etc.). Additionally, for Damage Protection and insurance purposes, the value of any given item is considered to be the lesser of (a) the price at which it was most recently purchased (last 12 months), or (b) the cost of replacement, as may be reasonably determined by Dolly. Further, the value of such an item is determined independently of the amount of any supplemental Damage Protection purchased from Dolly (in addition to the $300 of complimentary Damage Protection provided by Dolly). For example, if $1,000 of supplemental Damage Protection were purchased, the recent purchase price was $300, and the cost of replacement were $400, then Damage Protection would cover $300. Dolly reserves the right to reject any claims of damage not submitted within 14 days of the damaging incident. Dolly is not responsible for any damage that is incurred outside of the express-written parameters of the move as purchased by the customer. Any act undertaken by our independent contractors that is not explicitly paid for may not qualify for Damage Protection.",

It was really dispiriting.

Similar shape but not this particular one. Gas cylinder carts are specialized versions of this design. The ones that are used for compressed gass cylinders have straps to hold the cylinder in place as it moves. A single handle would make pushing one an even more awful experience. Most newer ones also have 4 wheels. The dolly leans at a 45 degree angle with all 4 wheels on the ground to make moving them more stable.

Dalton's, these were invaluable for carrying books up the stairs. H-carts were out of the question, the stairs turned halfway up.\n\nOSHA hazards aside, as a mall bookstore, we didn't bring the H-carts out on the floor often because, well, floor space. Takes up too much room and with people walking around with food and drink, we'd have abandoned leavings all the time if we did, I'm sure. So, V-carts to the rescue, H-carts for when the store was closed or it was going to be left behind the registers and you used that as the home base while you refilled the bestsellers, or what have you, at the front of the store.\n\nGenerally you'd sort by height, first and foremost, biggest books at the bottom, usually one v-cart per section of the store. If you were doing the fiction wall, try to alphabetize it a bit first (because the fiction wall, as implied, was a whole wall that ran the length of the store). But anything else -- eh. Most other sections were relatively compact. I think sci-fi / fantasy and romance were the two largest sections next to fiction, and if I'm remembering right, they were about six, maybe eight bays each. But, three (or four?) bays on one side facing the middle aisle (the main drag, with the most open space), and the same number on the opposite side, facing the fiction wall.\n\nSo if it wasn't alphabetically sorted in advance, you weren't *too* badly off. Especially since after a while, you memorized what letter was the last one used on each section's side, so if you came across an author on the latter half of the alphabet, no big deal, leave it on the cart until you had a few for the other side.\n\nOh, and if you've only got mass markets, you can fit two columns of books, easy, three of you turned them right, or had a single large hardcover on the bottom to serve as a larger base, like that illustrated (or was it just a collector's edition?) The Da Vinci Code that came out for a while there. That book was great for stacking books on the smaller V-carts.\n\n## Comment ID in05amf with +20 score by [(Mega_Zawesome, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in05amf/) (in reply to ID x580vr):\nah yes, the humble v-cart. the good ones have the rubber on the bottom edge so you can ram it into the doors in the back\n\n## Comment ID imzzi52 with +28 score by [(theHLB, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/imzzi52/) (in reply to ID x580vr):\nThe trusty Barnes & Noble V-cart. 🙂\n\n## Comment ID in018rt with +11 score by [(Alertox, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in018rt/) (in reply to ID x580vr):\nSymmetrical book stacking…just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947.\n\n### Comment ID in0nef7 with +7 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in0nef7/) (in reply to ID in018rt):\nYou're right, no human being would stack books like this.\n\n#### Comment ID in0uqax with +2 score by [(LawDog23, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in0uqax/) (in reply to ID in0nef7):\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Wel63QwhfpU\n\n## Comment ID in11e1h with +10 score by [(tI-_-tI, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in11e1h/) (in reply to ID x580vr):\nWhen it breaks, and you order new parts, do you have to ask \"is the Dolly part in?\"\n\n### Comment ID in18vtp with +2 score by [(Nosmurfz, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in18vtp/) (in reply to ID in11e1h):\nI see what you did there\n\n#### Comment ID in2p0d4 with +2 score by [(tI-_-tI, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in2p0d4/) (in reply to ID in18vtp):\nShout out Dolly Parton's Imagination Library!  https://imaginationlibrary.com/\n\n## Comment ID in0ax8v with +6 score by [(Domestica, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in0ax8v/) (in reply to ID x580vr):\nBack when I worked at b&n, the SM liked to use these carts to stack the cash tills when transporting them from the office to the front registers.

This is why the DSP's are constantly hitting the DA's up for \"fantastic/fantastic+\" on their scorecards. The DSP rating fair vs fantastic vs fantastic+ is literally the difference of thousands of dollars a week in bonuses. Amazon puts them over the barrel on following their dumbass requirements by tying the actual \"profit\" into those scorecard results. It is intentional and scummy as fuck given how fucking stupid most of the scorecard requirements can be.\n\n  \nThis is also why a bunch of DSP's tie \"bonus pay\" into your score. If you do really well, it makes them more money... so they pass some of it along hoping that you'll keep chasing that to make them more money.\n\n#### Comment ID lbtuekr with +6 score by [(WesternExplanation, Reddit, 2024-07-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonDSPDrivers/comments/1dw920i/i_left_a_dolly_at_an_apartment_complex/lbtuekr/) (in reply to ID lbtn8tu):\nDsps really don’t make much money.

I used to be a dispatcher and all my DSP offered was those bullshit plastic fold up dollys that can't even hold 20 pounds without falling over.

That was an investment that my boss was really hesitant to let me make and as much as I think he's a scam artist, turns out he was right. That said, you can't make employees pay for lost or damaged property, even if they did ruin a good thing I was trying to do for all of us in less than a week.

If that’s the case, I wonder if having a car in front of you prevents it from happening because it gives your eyes something to focus on, thereby reducing the amount of visual information that changes from second to second.

I was nearing the end of the hike and the path ahead was stationary but the scenery beyond it started to zoom out exactly like the gif above.

Both houses have wood flooring.\n\nWe'll probably use a pickup truck to transport it.  A lift gate truck would be nice, but probably not attainable.\n\nWhat do I need to easily move the fridge ?\n\n\\- furniture sliders ?\n\n\\- appliance dolly ?\n\n\\- ratchet straps ?\n\n\\- moving blankets ?\n\n\\- ramps to get in the back of the pickup truck ?\n\n**Update**\n\nThe fridge has been moved. \n\nI hired a guy with a pickup truck.  My buddy brought his furniture dolly.\n\nWe strapped the fridge to the furniture dolly and wheeled it out to the truck.   We put the back of the dolly against the endgate.  Two guys on the bottom of the fridge, one guy in the bed of the truck pulling up.   It went up easily.  As soon as the fridge leans back, the tailgate is holding half the weight of the fridge. \n\nWe rolled the dolly was against the front of the box.  We strapped the dolly to the front of the box and also to the back of the box with ratchet straps. It was very secure.\n\nUnloading was reverse of loading.  Lean the fridge back and wheel it to the edge of the tailgate.  Then slowly edge it over while 2 guys help from the ground.   It helps to have a dolly that has skids or tracks just above the wheels that are level with the back of the wheels, like this one.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0ojuGCkmNg\n\nI had to remove the doors and drawer fronts to get it through the door in my house. The opening of my front door was 33\".   The fridge was 36\" deep with the door handles.\n\n## Comment ID j6tmtnn with +8 score by [(cef911f1, Reddit, 2023-02-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tools/comments/10r4vsr/what_do_i_need_to_easily_move_a_350_pound/j6tmtnn/) (in reply to ID 10r4vsr):\nI bought an appliance dolly from Harbor Freight when we moved.

The sub zeros (only though at 350#) are easy to roll sense they have wheels to get them out from the wall which you can adjust to the max height once it’s out of the boxed in area. Don’t forget to turn off the water supply first. Anyways they’re all top heavy so most delivery guys bring them in with forearm forklifts and use an appliance dolly just to get to the front door. It’s a pain in the ass to roll inside sense the fridge outweighs you and doorways need you to really tip to clear them.\n\n## Comment ID j6u4wku with +1 score by [(NagromYargTrebloc, Reddit, 2023-02-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tools/comments/10r4vsr/what_do_i_need_to_easily_move_a_350_pound/j6u4wku/) (in reply to ID 10r4vsr):\nRent an appliance dolly.

It's nonsense. Go rent a 15 ft U-Haul with a pullout ramp. \n\nIf you want to cheap out on a hand truck use U-Haul's and throw a ratchet strap around the hand truck and the fridge. It works but it's makeshift. If you want to do it right rent a Reefer dolly and make sure it has stair climbers (treads on the back)\n\nRent a 6 pack of pads from U-Haul as well. Before you get it in the house lay 3-4 once folded pads on top of one another. Roll the fridge onto the end of the pad stack and grab the other end to drag it through the house. Pull it slow and make sure you don't scratch the floor.\n\nAlso measure everything before you get the fridge to the door and realize it doesn't fit\n\nGood luck 🤙\n\n## Comment ID j6wrl35 with +1 score by [(jjones20202020, Reddit, 2023-02-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tools/comments/10r4vsr/what_do_i_need_to_easily_move_a_350_pound/j6wrl35/) (in reply to ID 10r4vsr):\n350lbs is not that bad.  Shoulder lifting straps with a second person will make getting it to a pickup truck cake.  Remove anything from inside you can to make it lighter and less destructive. From there set it on the ground.  Put down a moving blanket or two.   \n Rotate it to whichever side you like.  Lean it slowly into the back of the truck until the side contacts the truck.  Lift the back end of it (will be easy for one person).  Slide it in slowly.  When you unload it do the reverse, just be careful it doesn't slide when you tip it out.

      "# [Dolly Parton is sending free books to children across 21 states — and around the world by HEATHER HOLLINGSWORTH, BRUCE SCHREINER on 2024-08-27](https://apnews.com/article/dolly-parton-children-books-states-program-5aa502c1905babd9604e9b3588942995)\nDolly Parton’s father grew up poor and never got the chance to learn to read.\n\nInspired by her upbringing, the 78-year-old country music legend has made it her mission over the past three decades to improve literacy through her Imagination Library book giveaway program. It has expanded statewide in places like Missouri and Kentucky, two of 21 states where all children under the age of 5 can enroll to have books mailed to their homes monthly.\n\nTo celebrate, she made stops Tuesday in both states to promote the program and tell the story of her father, Robert Lee Parton, who died in 2000.\n\n“In the mountains, a lot of people never had a chance to go to school because they had to work on the farms,” she said at the Folly Theater in Kansas City, Missouri. “They had to do whatever it took to keep the rest of the family going.”\n\nParton, the fourth of 12 children from a poor Appalachian family, said her father was “one of the smartest people I’ve ever known,” but he was embarrassed that he couldn’t read.\n\nAnd so she decided to help other kids, initially rolling out the program in a single county in her home state of Tennessee in 1995. It spread quickly from there, and today over 3 million books are sent out each month. Since the program started, books have been sent to more than 240 million to kids in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia.\n\nMissouri covers the full cost of the program, which totaled $11 million in the latest fiscal year. Most of the other states chip in money through a cost-sharing model.\n\n“The kids started calling me the ‘book lady,’” Parton said. “And Daddy was more proud of that than he was that I was a star. But Daddy got to feeling like he had really done something great as well.”\n\nIn Kentucky, the Imagination Library reaches children in all 120 counties, Gov. Andy Beshear said at an event Tuesday with Parton. More than 120,000 Kentucky children — nearly half of all preschoolers in the state — are currently enrolled to receive books through the program, first lady Britainy Beshear said.\n\nIt encourages families to read together, and it allows children to have their own personal library before starting kindergarten, at no cost to their families, the first lady said.\n\n“It’s really a great way to teach children when they’re very young to learn to love books and to learn to read,” Parton said during the event in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nParton, who earned the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award a decade ago, said she eventually wants to see the program in every state. While there is a presence in all of them, 21 have legislation ensuring all kids under 5 can enroll. She said she is proud that her dad lived long enough to see the program get off the ground.\n\n“That was kind of my way to honor my dad, because the Bible says to honor your father and mother,” she said. “And I don’t think that just means, ‘just obey.’ I think it means to bring honor to their name and to them.”\n\nParton is an author herself whose titles include the 1996 children’s book “Coat of Many Colors,” which is part of the book giveaway program.\n\nAs she prepared to sing her famous song by the same name, she explained that it is about a coat her mother made her from a patchwork of mismatched fabric, since the family was too poor to afford a large piece of a single fabric. Parton was proud of it because her mother likened it the multicolored coat that is told about in the Bible — a fantastic gift from Jacob to his son Joseph.\n\nClassmates, however, laughed at her. For years, she said the experience was a “deep, deep hurt.”\n\nShe said that with writing and performing the song, “the hurt just left me.” She received letters over the years from people saying it did the same thing for them.\n\n“The fact,” she explained, “that that little song has just meant so much not only to me, but to so many other people for so many different reasons, makes it my favorite song.”\n\nAsked in Kentucky about her lasting legacy, Parton said she’d like to be remembered as “a good ole girl” who worked hard and tried to make people happy and the world a better place.\n\n“Of course I want to be known as a songwriter and a singer, but I honestly can say that the Imagination Library has meant as much, if not more, to me than nearly anything that I’ve ever done,” she said.\n\n___\n\nHollingsworth reported from Mission, Kansas. Schreiner reported from Frankfort, Kentucky.",
      "# [Dolly Parton's theme park, Dollywood, hit by \"unprecedented flooding event\" that injured at least 1 by Emily Mae Czachor on 2024-07-29](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dollywood-dolly-parton-theme-park-flash-flooding/)\nThunderstorms rocked portions of eastern Tennessee on Sunday, dumping heavy rain and flash flooding to Dolly Parton's amusement park, Dollywood. At least one person was injured, officials said.\n\nIt wasn't clear on Monday morning exactly how much water had inundated the park or the extent of the damage it caused, but the park's public relations director, Wes Ramey, told CBS News that storms had dumped almost five inches of rain onto Dollywood over the course of just an hour. Ramey described the situation as \"an unprecedented flooding event.\"\n\nVideo recorded inside Dollywood and submitted to CBS News affiliate WVLT during Sunday's deluge appeared to show groups of people wading through knee-deep water in some places. The police department in Pigeon Forge, where Dollywood is located, said in a statement on Sunday night on social media that McCarter Hollow Road, at the park's entrance, had collapsed and was closed to traffic. There was an alternate route that people in the area could use instead, according to police.\n\nRamey confirmed that Dollywood was scheduled to reopen at 12 p.m. local time on Monday, as park officials had said in an initial statement on their response to the flooding Sunday evening.\n\n\"This afternoon, Sunday, July 28, a strong thunderstorm caused flash flooding at Dollywood,\" Dollywood Parks and Resortssaid in the earlier statement. \"With the assistance of Pigeon Forge Police and Fire Departments, park personnel directed guests to safety during the storm. At this time, one minor injury has been reported.\"\n\nOfficials didn't elaborate on the nature of that injury. They said Dollywood was \"supporting guests whose vehicles were affected\" by the weather and crews had been deployed to clean up the area.\n\n\"While the volume of rain was difficult for both the park's and the city's infrastructure to manage, the fact we have only one minor injury illustrates how well our hosts handled the situation and how well our guests followed their directions,\" Ramey told CBS News about an hour before Dollywood was set to reopen. \"We will evaluate the response to determine if any changes are needed moving forward, but we are proud of our maintenance and operations teams for their hard work that allowed us to reopen less than 24 hours after an unprecedented flooding event like this one.\"\n\nThe park will honor guests' Sunday tickets for admission on Monday, or provide rain checks for a future visit, Ramey said.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Morristown issued a flash flood warning for Pigeon Forge that remained in place until around 11 p.m. on Sunday. Many roads around Dollywood that shut down because of the storms, including in nearby Sevier County, reopened around the same time the weather service lifted its warning.",

      "# [Dolly Parton gives inside look at new Dollywood attraction, shares why it makes her \"so emotional\" by Anthony Mason, Analisa Novak on 2024-07-09](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dolly-parton-dollywood-exhibit-the-dolly-parton-experience-tennesee-music-career/)\nDollywood recently unveiled its latest attraction, The Dolly Parton Experience, celebrating the life, career and fashion of the country music legend. The new exhibits opened as Dollywood was named Tripadvisor's No. 1 theme park in the U.S. and among their top 10 attractions worldwide in 2024.\n\nThe exhibits inside Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, showcase Parton's iconic costumes, including her famous high heels.\n\n\"I'm a big shoe person 'cause I'm so short,\" Parton joked in an interview that aired Tuesday on \"CBS Mornings.\"\n\nVisitors can engage interactively by \"Dressing Dolly,\" choosing Parton's wardrobe and selecting a guitar for her.\n\n\"I dress her every day,\" Parton said with a laugh as she strolled through the attraction.\n\nParton said she had the idea of the experience for years, and now that it has come to life, she feels overwhelmed by the exhibit's scope.\n\n\"You know how they say sometimes that when you start to die, your whole life flashes before you?\" she said. \"Well, it about killed me going through there 'cause I got so emotional.\"\n\nSongwriting legacy\n\nParton's songwriting, which began in her childhood, is a central theme of the exhibit. It's something she has always believed in, with encouragement from her mother, who was fascinated by Parton's songwriting capabilities. Parton says her skill with the pen is her most important.\n\n\"I take myself more serious as a songwriter than anything else. And if I had to give up every other part of the business, I would choose to be a writer,\" she said. \"Because that's my therapist. My guitar is my friend.\"\n\nThe music icon still gets excited when she comes up with a good lyric. Sometimes, when Parton thinks of a good line, she feels it must be divine inspiration. That was the case for one of her most famous lines. \"Tumble out of bed and I stumble to the kitchen, pour myself a cup of ambition,\" the opening lines from her 1980 hit \"9 to 5\" came to her quickly.\n\n\"That just rolled right out. I hadn't even thought about that,\" she said. \"When I thought of that one, I went, wow, that's - that's as good as this cup of coffee's going to be.\"\n\nNotable career moments\n\nParton was determined to make it in the music industry. Despite initial resistance from Nashville, Parton said her perseverance never wavered.\n\n\"Giving up ain't in me,\" she asserted.\n\nThe exhibit features notable moments from her career, including her collaboration with Porter Wagoner starting in 1967. Her appearances on his TV show significantly boosted her popularity. She became so popular, she said, that Wagoner didn't want her to leave, but Parton had other plans and wrote him a song - \"I Will Always Love You.\"\n\nWhen she played, \"I Will Always Love You,\" for him, he was moved to tears and told her it was the best song she had ever written. He agreed to let her go if he could produce it, and she did.\n\nParton later heard that Elvis Presley wanted to record the song, but his manager, Colonel Tom Parker, demanded all the publishing rights. She refused.\n\n\"I said, 'Well, it's gonna be the biggest heartbreak of my life. You can't have it. I can't do that 'cause this is my most important copyright,'\" said Parton. Priscilla Presley later told Parton that Elvis was singing it to her as they walked down the courthouse steps during their divorce.\n\nBeyoncé's take on \"Jolene\"\n\nParton's music continues to resonate across generations, with her songs covered by artists like Beyoncé. Parton said she's proud of Beyoncé's interpretation of \"Jolene\" on her latest album, \"Cowboy Carter.\"\n\n\"I was just assuming it was gonna be that you know, 'Jolene' the traditional way. But when I heard it, I thought, 'Wow boy, she put a lot into that.' And that was a great album of hers, by the way,\" said Parton.\n\nAs Parton reflected on her career, she expressed hope for more projects in the future, including the Broadway musical based on her life story.\n\n\"I'm on my last chapter because of my age and everything, but I want [it] to really be the best one,\" she said. \"I want the story to end really well.\"",
      "# [Broadway star Gavin Creel, known for performances in 'Hello, Dolly!' and 'Hair,' dies at 48 by Kalhan Rosenblatt on 2024-09-30](https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/gavin-creel-dies-broadway-tony-award-winner-rcna173318)\nTony Award-winning Broadway star Gavin Creel died Monday, months after being diagnosed with an aggressive, rare cancer. He was 48.\n\nCreel was diagnosed with metastatic melanotic peripheral nerve sheath sarcoma in July and was treated at New York City’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, according to a representative for Creel, who confirmed his death to NBC News.\n\nCreel’s Broadway career spanned 20 years. He made his Broadway debut as Jimmy Smith in “Thoroughly Modern Millie” in 2002, a role that earned him his first Tony nomination. He went on to star in \"Hair,\" which also landed him a nod; \"La Cage aux Folles\"; \"She Loves Me\"; \"The Book of Mormon\"; and \"Waitress,\" according to his website. He took home a Tony Award in 2017 for his performance as Cornelius Hackl in the Broadway revival of “Hello, Dolly!”\n\nThe actor, who was known for his high-energy physical performances, also won a Grammy in 2023 for the Broadway revival of Stephen Sondheim’s “Into the Woods” and an Olivier Award in 2014 for his performance as Elder Price in “The Book of Mormon.”\n\nMany in the theater community — including “Hello Dolly!” co-star Bette Midler, original “Wicked” star Kristin Chenoweth and “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda — expressed shock and sadness over the news on social media, describing Creel as a beloved legend.\n\n“Gavin Creel was our first King when all we had was 11 songs and he wrapped the audience around his finger with nothing but a Burger King crown and his mind-blowing charisma and talent,” Miranda wrote in his Instagram post. “He is so loved and it is unimaginable that he’s no longer with us.”\n\n“The Book of Mormon” alums Josh Gad and Andrew Rannells also mourned Creel in posts.\n\n“We have lost someone far too young, far too early still in his journey and far too impactful to our creative community. My heart breaks for his family and his closest friends,” Gad wrote on Instagram. “This is just not fair.”\n\n“We were living big, exciting lives at times but the moments we were happiest, the moments we were most ourselves, were the quiet ones,” Rannells wrote. “We called each other 'Soulmate' or 'Soulie' for short. It was a joke that became a nickname that, in some ways, became a truth that made us both smile when we said it. My heart feels incredibly empty today. I know I’m not alone in this feeling because again, everyone fell in love with Gavin.”\n\nSutton Foster, who played opposite of Creel in “Thoroughly Modern Millie,” posted an image of the two on Instagram, writing, “My sweet friend. I will love you forever.”\n\nTom Viola, executive director of Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, described the late actor as “not just one of the good ones, but the best one.”\n\nThe philanthropic organization, where Creel was a member of the board of trustees, provides resources to those affected by life-threatening illnesses like AIDS and Covid-19.\n\n“Beyond the shining talent Gavin Creel shared with us all onstage, he mastered the ability to galvanize, mobilize and inspire others by sharing the best of himself which was simply, his loving, joyful heart,” Viola said in a statement.\n\nThe Shubert Organization, the oldest professional theater company in the United States, wrote on X that the “lights on Broadway will shine a little less” after Creel’s death.\n\nSAG-AFTRA, the actors union that Creel was a member of, said in its post that one of “Broadway’s brightest lights has left us.”\n\nThe account behind the Tony Awards called Creel's death a \"devastating loss.\"",

The stories in his songs were things we were experiencing. Then, he wrote, ‘Why Me Lord.’ When we heard that song the message struck home. It assured us that we were on the right track. We love Kris and his beautiful family. Please remember them in your prayers.”\n\n— Duane Allen in a statement\n\n“I had the pleasure of knowing Kris and performing and participating at a few events with him over the years.

He was 88.\n\nLeading the tributes for Kristofferson were some the likes of Parton, a longtime and frequent collaborator of his, and Streisand, who famously shared the screen with him in 1976's \"A Star Is Born.\"\n\n\"What a great loss. What a great writer. What a great actor. What a great friend,\" Parton wrote in a statement posted to Instagram. \"I will always love you.\"\n\nStreisand shared an image of the \"A Star Is Born\" soundtrack and a photo of her and Kristofferson performing together in London in 2019 alongside her Instagram tribute.\n\n\"The first time I saw Kris performing at the Troubadour club in L.A. I knew he was something special. Barefoot and strumming his guitar, he seemed like the perfect choice for a script I was developing, which eventually became A Star Is Born,\" she wrote. \"In the movie, Kris and I sand the song I'd written for the film's main love theme, 'Evergreen.'\"\n\n\"For my latest concert in 2019 at London's Hyde Park, I asked Kris to join me on-stage to sing our other A Star Is Born duet, 'Lost Inside of You.' He was as charming as ever, and the audience showered him with applause. It was a joy seeing him receive the recognition and love he so richly deserved,\" she continued. \"My thoughts go to Kris' wife, Lisa who I know supported him in every way possible.\"\n\nSee how other stars are remembering Kristofferson below:\n\nReba McEntire: \"What a gentleman, kind soul, and a lover of words. I am so glad I got to meet him and be around him. One of my favorite people. Rest in peace, Kris,\" Reba McEntire wrote on Instagram.\n\nRosanne Cash: \"Here was a man. A man I knew most of my life. A piece of my heart and family history. I expected he'd leave the planet fairly soon but it doesn't change the magnitude of the loss. And yet we will always have him — his enormous legacy, his resonant spirit, the lasting power of his authenticity, his staggering gifts as a poet — in word, on screen, in his being. For the last several decades, there was no Kris without Lisa and her beauty and steadfastness is a constant inspiration. I send you all my love, Lisa. Travel safe, dear brother. I will always love you,\" Rosanne Cash wrote on Instagram.\n\nTravis Tritt: \"Sad to hear of Kris Kristofferson's passing. He was an inspiration to me and I was fortunate to get to know him on the set of 'Outlaw Justice' that we filmed in Spain in 1998. My heartfelt condolences go out to Kris's wife, Lisa and all of his family, friends and fans,\" Travis Tritt shared on Instagram.\n\nDiane Warren: \"Brilliant songwriter, Rhodes scholar, great actor, not to mention criminally handsome. How often do U get all that in one human? Write in Power forever Kris Kristofferson. We are losing too many greats and we just lost another one,\" Diane Warren wrote on Instagram.\n\nDakota Fanning: \"This legend was so good to me when we worked together on Dreamer. What an honor to have spent time in his presence,\" Dakota Fanning wrote in an Instagram story.\n\nMelissa Etheridge: \"Loved this man, his talent, his mind and his beautiful heart. Journey well, my friend,\" Melissa Etheridge wrote on Instagram.\n\nDarius Rucker: \"We lost one of the kindest most beautiful souls that God gave us. I will miss u my friend. I love u Kriss.

A crushing disease for the afflicted, family and friends, as well as caregivers, consider giving to the cause of your liking.\n\nDolly was born June 24, 1950, in Lake Forest, Ill., to parents Dale and Lois Jerik. Shortly after, the close-knit family made the move to Ironwood, where her father worked for the Railway Express Agency and then created a camper/RV sales and service company. She graduated from Luther L. Wright High School in 1968. While Dolly was attending Gogebic College, she was swept off her feet by this guy, with whom many of you are acquainted. We were married in Ironwood on Aug. 29, 1970. Shortly after, we were subsequently blessed, most of the time, with our two boys, Geoffrey and Billy.\n\nA self-made woman, Dolly ventured into banking after a stint with Kluggnes Electronics. She later progressed to become President of the Iron Mountain-Kingsford Community Federal Credit Union.\n\nA few years later, she informed me that she was running for the elected office of Dickinson County Clerk! The first campaign effort fell just short, but the next try she succeeded. History was made, and 30 years later, she received several commendations from the State of Michigan for her service. She succeeded in a man’s world, a male-dominated profession, and I am proud of her achievements! She was honored to be Grand Marshall in the 2021 4th of July parade in Dickinson County. Health problems began shortly after her retirement, yet we managed one more Amtrak adventure in 2022. We took our granddaughters on the Amtrak out of Milwaukee for a night in downtown Chicago. Dolly and I then boarded the California Zephyr for a round-robin to San Francisco and Seattle, and back home. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to travel together.\n\nDolly loved spending time with her friends, family and pets. She loved Dickinson County, serving her community, and she loved her country with pride. Dolly enjoyed politics, reading, fishing, the occasional golf outing, gardening, true crime and traveling on Amtrak. She enjoyed the sunshine as well as feeding her many backyard critters. Dolly especially cherished time with her two granddaughters.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents, Dale and Lois Jerik; brothers-in-law, Ray Emmrich and Clifton Cook; sister-in-law, Tina Jerik; and in-laws, James and Lily Cook.\n\nDolly is survived by her husband, Bill Cook of Iron Mountain; her sons, Bill (Heidi) Cook of Aurora, Wis., and Geoffrey (Brittany) Cook of Appleton, Wis.; granddaughters, Indie and Ivy Cook of Appleton; one sister, Jeri Emmrich of Hurley, Wis.; brothers, Dan (Candy) Jerik of Minneapolis and Bob Jerik of Kenosha, Wis.; many nieces and nephews whom she adored; not to mention many special friends.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held from 3 to 9 p.m. on Friday, July 12 at the Iron Mountain City Park Pavilion. Food and drinks will be provided.\n\nMany thanks to Dr. Schroeder and Michigan-Wisconsin Family Practice, Dr. Shanelli Fernando and Associates at ThedaCare Cancer, Dr. Wald at ThedaCare Pulmonary, Dr. Cynthia Geocaris and Dr. Shannon Schmidt and the staff at ThedaCare, and the gal that came to our home to obtain blood from Dolly. A heartfelt thank you to Laura from Arcadia Home Care for her soothing manner that I am convinced pulled Dolly from a coma and gave us one more day to communicate with her. If I have forgotten to mention any of you, be assured I haven’t forgotten you!\n\nFriends may leave condolences and tributes to Dolly’s family online at www.jacobsfuneralhomes.com.\n\nThe family has chosen Jacobs Funeral Home of Iron Mountain to honor Dolly’s legacy of life.",

      "# [Back where it belongs: ‘Hello, Dolly!’ returns to SIU’s McLeod Theater stage by Pete Rosenbery](https://news.siu.edu/2024/07/070524-back-where-it-belongs-hello-dolly-returns-to-sius-mcleod-theater-stage.php)\nby Pete Rosenbery\n\nCARBONDALE, Ill. — The matchmaking and romantic exploits of Dolly Gallagher Levi come to the Southern Illinois University Carbondale McLeod Theater stage next week as “Hello, Dolly!” closes out the 2024 McLeod Summer Playhouse season.\n\nThe Tony Award-winning musical, which follows Levi’s pursuit of unmarried half-a-millionaire Horace Vandergelder, was part of MSP’s first season. This year’s performances are at 7:30 p.m. July 12-13 and July 19-20 and 2 p.m. July 14 and July 21.\n\nAngela Shultz, an assistant professor of practice in the School of Music, is portraying the title character.\n\n“Besides playing an iconic role in musical theater, I relate to Dolly,” Shultz said. “She easily sees how she can make things better for others, but it often leaves her needs unmet. It’s the plight of teachers, caregivers, parents.”\n\nAn award-winning singer, actor and teaching artist, Shultz’s background includes performing in numerous productions in New York City. She said she has never had to memorize so much in a musical.\n\n“It’s enormously challenging and thrilling,” Shultz said. “Without a doubt, my favorite part has been sharing this process with professionals and connecting with that part of myself again. Even more so, sharing the stage with my students is a singular experience. I’ve loved watching their knowledge and passion thrive and grow, and it’s added a nuance to our work together.”\n\nThen, there are the musical’s famous songs.\n\n“Who can walk away not singing these songs? It's also a show that has featured some of the most iconic leading ladies since it premiered 60 years ago,” Shultz said. “Whatever your personal experience with love, you’ll find a story to connect with in the show, and I think it’s why it has stood the test of time.”\n\nSIU theater alumnus is director\n\n“Hello Dolly!” marks the 100th directing project for director Bill Kincaid, a former SIU faculty member and Master of Fine Arts theater graduate, since his thesis production in 1988. In addition to university productions, Kincaid, an emeritus faculty member at Western Illinois University, has directed comedies, dramas, musicals and Shakespeare at theaters in nine states, including Illinois. After going to SIU in the 1980s, Kincaid returned to serve on the theater faculty in the late 1990s and early 2000s and has directed several shows on the McLeod stage.\n\n“It feels fitting that my 100th show is back on the McLeod stage,” said Kincaid, who celebrated his 60th birthday on June 11, which was the first day of rehearsals. “It seemed fitting to start a new decade doing something I love so much and doing it in a location that has been such a big part of my life. I have a long history here and lots of great memories.”\n\nClassic tale of love and romance\n\nKincaid said his interest in the “beloved classic” begins with the play “The Matchmaker,” which was written by Thorton Wilder, and from where the musical adaptation was born.\n\nHe noted that “Before the Parade Passes By,” the last song in Act One, “is about embracing joy, putting the past behind you and living life to the fullest; it’s about looking around and acknowledging everyday beauty.”\n\n“It also intrigues me that the play follows the story of four couples, all at different stages in their lives, and it explores what love and romance mean to people of different ages,” Kincaid said. “Depending on where a person is in their life, they may be looking for various things in a relationship: adventure and excitement, passionate romantic love, the opportunity to start a family, or companionship and security. Love isn’t just one thing. It’s not that simple.”\n\nTalented cast\n\nThere are 22 actors in the cast, several of whom Kincaid has worked with before, including when he directed “Little Women” at SIU Carbondale in December 2022. That list of company members also includes Christopher Jorandy, a props artisan that Kincaid had as a student while at SIU. Kincaid and costume designer Wendi Zea have worked 17 shows together.\n\n“Rehearsals have been excellent. The level of talent in the room is staggering, and the singing is absolutely glorious,” he said. “We assembled a really great cast for this one.”\n\nMSP tickets available\n\nBeer and wine will be served at cash only bars in the lobby before performances and during intermission.",
      "# [Federalist writer regrets saying Dolly Parton had a false gospel by Staff Reports on 2024-06-11](https://vicksburgnews.com/federalist-writer-regrets-saying-dolly-parton-had-a-false-gospel/)\nDolly Parton’s fans defended the country music icon after an essay on the Federalist conservative news site attacked her faith. The essay targeted the 78-year-old “Jolene” singer for her support of the LGBTQ community earlier this week.\n\nThe headline, “There’s Nothing Loving About Dolly Parton’s False Gospel,” caught many people off guard. Consequently, supporters flooded social media with critical messages about the essay. In response to the backlash, the writer expressed regret for using such a beloved figure to make her point.\n\nFederalist writer Ericka Andersen criticized Parton for her nonjudgmental approach to life. Specifically, Andersen took issue with Parton’s claim that she loves everyone, including members of the LGBTQ community. Furthermore, Parton has shown support for these communities in interviews.\n\nAdditionally, Andersen argued that if Parton is a Christian, as she proclaims, she should call out homosexuality as a sin. Andersen stated, “Parton’s version of love, which includes condoning immoral sexual behavior (‘be who you are,’ she’s said), is unaligned with God’s vision for humanity.”\n\nMoreover, Andersen told Yahoo Entertainment on Saturday that the widespread backlash made her realize she shouldn’t have used Parton to press her argument.\n\n“I regret using Dolly as the example for the point I was making in the article,” she said. “As I wrote in the piece, I love her and think she does some incredible things for the world. We all make poor choices in how to frame things sometimes. This was one of those moments for me! Dolly is one of the few people who is beloved by all and who loves all. The world is lucky to have her.”",
      "# [Dolly Parton, governor celebrate Imagination Library mark by Austin Schick on 2024-08-28](https://spectrumnews1.com/ky/louisville/news/2024/08/28/dolly-parton-in-lexington)\nLEXINGTON, Ky. â Grammy Award-winning country music artist Dolly Parton visited Lexington Tuesday to celebrate her Imagination Library in Kentucky.\n\nAll 120 counties in Kentucky recently got access to Partonâs Imagination Library. The country music legend joined Gov. Andy Beshear, D-Ky., and first lady Britainy Beshear to commemorate the occasion.\n\nParton started the Imagination Library in 1995 to honor her father, who could not read or write.\n\nâHe was always real embarrassed about that and that always troubled him because he thought that he couldnât learn to read after he was grown, but daddy was one of the smartest people that you would ever want to know, and he was my hero,â Parton said.\n\nThe no-cost program provides one book a month to children from childbirth to the age of five. Nationwide, over 3 million kids are registered with over 250 million books gifted since its inception.\n\nâItâs really a great way to teach children when theyâre very young to learn to love books and to learn to read,â Parton said.\n\nParton started the program locally in her east Tennessee hometown. Since then, it has grown to 21 states and numerous countries. In Kentucky, over 120,000 children receive free books every month. The program is available from Pikeville to Paducah, with over 6 million books distributed statewide.\n\nâForty-five percent of preschoolers in our state are currently enrolled in the Imagination Library. So that means if you know someone in that 55%, you better get on your phones as soon as we leave here,â said first lady Beshear.\n\nCongressman Morgan McGarvey, D-Louisville, worked to pass the funding for the program during his time in the Kentucky Senate. It was passed in a bipartisan manner.\n\nâBy having every child eligible, thereâs no stigma attached. Kids who are going to kindergarten, not only are they more kindergarten ready, theyâve read some of the same books and they have that common bond,â McGarvey said.\n\nThe statewide program is supported by a 50% state to local program match provided in the state budget, passed by the General Assembly.\n\nThe governor also honored Parton as a Kentucky Colonel and proclaimed the month âImagination Library of Kentucky Month.â\n\nFirst lady Beshear presented Parton with a copy of First Dog Winnieâs new coloring book, âWinnie Goes on a Kentucky State Parks Adventure!â In return, Parton gifted the governor and first lady with a copy of her childrenâs book, âCoat of Many Colors,â named after her hit 1971 song.\n\nMore than 20 years ago, Henderson County established the first Imagination Library program in Kentucky."
