      "# [Terms of Service](https://dolly.com/terms)\nDolly Terms of Service\n\nLast Revised: January 4, 2024\n\nPLEASE READ THESE LEGALLY BINDING DOLLY TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY, INCLUDING ANY LINKED TERMS (COLLECTIVELY âTERMSâ) BEFORE ACCESSING OR USING ANY COMPONENT OF THE DOLLY PLATFORM OR ANY RELATED PRODUCTS, SERVICES, OR CONTENT.\n\nThis is a legal agreement between Dolly, Inc. (\"Dolly,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\") and the individual that downloads, accesses, installs or uses any aspect of the Dolly Platform (defined below) (âyouâ or âyourâ) whether or not such downloading, access, installation, or use is direct (or indirect via a third-party who downloads, accesses, installs or uses the Dolly Platform on your behalf ). Dolly and you are each deemed a âPartyâ or the âPartiesâ to these Terms.\n\nThe Dolly Platform connects you with service providers (each, a \"Helper\") whom you can engage via the Dolly Platform to move your stuff to an agreed location specified by you.\n\nThese Terms apply to any access and/or use of the Dolly mobile application (the \"App\"), the www.Dolly.com website (or the related Dolly domains, including book.dolly.com) (the \"Site(s)\") and any other products and services Dolly makes available to you via its App or its Site(s), including the updates and upgrades of any of the forgoing that are provided to you during the term (collectively, the \"Dolly Platform\").\n\nFor more information about the Dolly Platform, please see our Customer Knowledge Base.\n\nAccepting these Terms\n\nBY DOWNLOADING THE APP, ACCESSING THE SITE(S) OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE MADE AVAILABLE VIA THE APP OR THE SITE(S) OR ANY COMPONENT OF THE DOLLY PLATFORM (OR BY ALLOWING A THIRD PARTY TO ACCESS OR USE THE DOLLY PLATFORM ON YOUR BEHALF OR FOR YOUR BENEFIT), YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS WITH RESPECT TO THE DOLLY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COVERED BY THESE TERMS. Please read all the terms before you directly (or indirectly) access or use (or have a third-party access or use) any component of the Dolly Platform on your behalf or for your benefit. If a term does not make sense to you, please let us know. If you don't agree to these Terms, you may not access or use (or ask a third party to access or use) the Dolly Platform on your behalf or for your benefit.\n\nModifications\n\nYou represent and warrant that you will review these Terms prior to making a Request and that any continued access or use of the Dolly Platform is subject to the then current Terms posted at the time of your access or use.\n\nWe reserve the right to change these Terms from time to time. The Terms applicable to you are the Terms in place when you access or use the Dolly Platform. If we make changes to the Terms, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of these Terms and, in some cases, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification).\n\nWe encourage you to review the Terms regularly, and prior to initiating any new Request on the Dolly Platform so that you are aware of the most current Terms which will apply at the time of your access or usage. If you do not agree to the Terms effective at the time of access or usage, then you should discontinue all use of the Dolly Platform.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFor information about how we collect, use and share information about users of the Dolly Platform, please see our Privacy Policy at http://dolly.com/privacy.\n\nDescription of the Dolly Platform\n\nThrough the Dolly Platform, you can submit a request (a \"Request\") for a Helper to pick up the item(s) you specify (each, an \"Item\") for loading, unloading, moving, hauling, packing, lifting, assembly or disassembly (the \"Services\"). You will receive a price quote for the fee that will apply to completing your Request for the Services (the \"Services Fee\"). Once you submit the payment information to cover the Service Fee for the Request, your Request will be sent out to our network of Helpers. You will receive a notification through the Dolly Platform when a Helper has accepted your Request and agrees to provide the Services, and you will be able to communicate with that Helper through the Dolly Platform to confirm and coordinate certain logistics involved with completing your Request.\n\nYou represent and warrant that the Items related to any Request are your personal property or that you have the requisite permissions, consents, and rights to make the Request of the Helper to perform the Services in relation to the Items specified in the Request and that completing the Services in relation to the Items identified in the Request will not result in the violation of any laws, regulations, contracts or agreements to which you are bound, or third party's rights of any kind.\n\nCreating Accounts\n\nWhen you create an account you must maintain the security of your password. If you discover or suspect that someone is accessing your account without your permission or has obtained your password or that there is any Dolly Platform security breaches, please let us know as soon as possible. You represent and warrant to us that all information that you provide in connection with your account is accurate, truthful, current and complete. Dolly reserves the right to deny any account at our discretion.\n\nPayment for Services\n\nYou must provide credit card information to submit a Request. You are responsible for paying the applicable Services Fee for any completed Services. Once you submit a Request, we will place a temporary hold on the credit card account you provided in an amount equal to 100% of the applicable Services Fee. Once you and the Helper have verified that the Services are completed, you will have the option of paying an additional gratuity (a \"Tip\") to the Helper, and your credit card account will be charged for the sum of the Services Fee, any Tip, and the fees for any additional services you may request.\n\nYou agree to make all payments to the Helper through the Dolly Platform and will not pay any Helper in cash or means other than directly through the Dolly Platform.\n\nCanceling a Request\n\nIf you cancel any Request before a Helper accepts it you will not be charged and the hold will be lifted on your credit card. If you cancel any Request after a Helper accepts it, your credit card account may be charged up to 100% of the applicable Services Fee as set forth in Dolly's cancellation policy.\n\nRight to Use the Dolly Platform; Certain Restrictions\n\nOn the condition that you fully comply with these Terms, Dolly grants you a limited, nonexclusive, non-transferable and revocable license to access and use the Dolly Platform for your own personal, non-commercial use.\n\nHowever, with respect to access and use of the App, you represent and warrant that you will only download and access the App on mobile devices that you own or control or that you have express permission to use.\n\nThese Terms will govern your access and use of any upgrades provided by Dolly that replace and/or supplement the original App, Site(s), or other components of the Dolly Platform. If a Dolly product or service is not covered by these Terms, then it will be accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern.\n\nYou may not (and you may not authorize any other party to) (a) modify, disclose, alter, translate or create derivative works of the Dolly Platform, (b) license, sublicense, resell, distribute, lease, rent, lend, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of the Dolly Platform, (c) disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer any of the software components of the Dolly Platform, (d) copy, frame or mirror any part of the Dolly Platform, (e) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Dolly Platform, or (f) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Dolly Platform or its related systems or networks. The restrictions stated herein apply to any and all components or parts of the Dolly Platform, including the App, Site(s), or any software that comprises any of the components of the Dolly Platform.\n\nProhibited Use of the Dolly Platform\n\nYou may not post or otherwise make available on or through the Dolly Platform any of the following:\n\nPrivate information of any other persons (including names, email addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers and financial information);\n\nContent or information that is false, fraudulent or intended to be misleading;\n\nContent that is libelous, defamatory, abusive, offensive or hateful;\n\nContent that is obscene, pornographic, indecent or sexually explicit, depicts graphic, excessive or gratuitous violence;\n\nContent that is illegal, harmful or offensive or that would encourage, solicit, foster, glorify or provide instructions for any criminal or civil offense;\n\nContent that may infringe, misappropriate or violate any intellectual property rights, rights of privacy, rights of publicity or any other rights of others;\n\nViruses, corrupted data or other harmful, disruptive or destructive files or code;\n\nContent that, in Dolly's judgment, is objectionable, may restrict or inhibit another from enjoying the Dolly Platform or may expose Dolly or users of the Dolly Platform to harm or liability of any type; and/or\n\nContent that you are contractually or legally required to keep confidential.\n\nAlso, you may not do any of the following in connection with the Dolly Platform (or any component thereof) or other users, each as applicable:\n\nUse the Dolly Platform in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Dolly Platform or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the Dolly Platform;\n\nEngage in phishing scams using any component of the Dolly Platform\n\nCollect any personal information about other users;\n\nIntimidate, threaten, stalk, bully or otherwise harass other users;\n\nPost spam or commercial messages through any component of Dolly Platform;\n\nCreate an account or submit a Request if you are not over 13 years of age;\n\nUse the Dolly Platform for any illegal or unauthorized purpose or to engage in, encourage or promote any activity that is unlawful or that violates these Terms; or\n\nDisable or circumvent or attempt to circumvent any access control or related process or procedure, filtering, security measures, rate limits or other features designed to protect the Dolly Platform, its users, or third parties.\n\nRelease, publish, and/or otherwise make available to any third party the results of any performance or functional evaluation of any component of the Dolly Platform without the prior written approval of Dolly;\n\nAlter or remove any proprietary notices or legends contained on or in the Dolly Platform components.\n\nAccess or use (or attempt to access or use) another user's account without permission, or solicit another user's login information, or make any attempts to access accounts or information not part of your account without permission;\n\nâFrameâ or âmirrorâ any portion of the online components of the Dolly Platform;\n\nUse any robot, spider, site search/retrieval application or other manual or automatic device or process to retrieve, index, âdata mineâ or in any way reproduce or circumvent the navigational structure or presentation of the Dolly Platform components; and\n\nProbe, scan or test the vulnerability of the online components of the Dolly Platform, nor breach the security or authentication measures of the component of the Dolly Platform or take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on the infrastructure of the online components of the Dolly Platform, such as a denial of service attack.\n\nYour use of the Dolly Platform is at your own risk. You are responsible and liable for the content of your Requests, your interaction with the Helpers and any other user of the Dolly Platform. You agree that Dolly is not responsible or liable for the content of your Requests, your actions, the conduct of, or your interactions with, Helpers or any other users (whether online or offline) or for any related damage or harm. As a mere provider of interactive services, Dolly is not liable for the content of any Requests or responses obtained in connection with making a Request. Although we have no obligation to screen, edit or monitor Requests or responses to Requests, we reserve the right, and have the discretion, to screen, edit or remove your or any Helper&s access to any component of the Dolly Platform or to remove any Requests at any time, for any reason and without notice.\n\nDisputes between You and a Helper; Disclaimers\n\nThe Dolly Platform is merely a neutral means of connecting you with Helpers. We are not responsible or liable for you, your actions (or inactions), your Requests, or for the Helpers, the Helper&s responses or actions (or inactions), the Services, or for the Items which are the subject of the requested Services. As a condition of allowing your access or usage of the Dolly Platform to connect with Helpers, you agree to forgo and waive any claim or suit against us and to release us from any liability, loss, damages, or harm (a) caused by the Helpers or their Services (or their failure to provide adequate services); (b) relating to the Items or the handling of Items (subject to any Damage Protection outlined below); and (c) to persons or to property (personal or real) associated with Request or the delivery of Services (or failure to deliver Services).\n\nWe provide no warranty or assurance of any kind that any Helper you engage will meet your expectations or will follow your instructions in performing any Services or not cause harm or damage to your Items or to other property or persons. Any dispute that you may have with the Helper regarding the performance of any Services (or the Items which are the subject of the Services), including any dispute related to the time, place, and manner of performing, is between you and the applicable Helper. Dolly is not responsible for the replacement or repair of any of any Item or for damage, loss or harm to any other personal or real property that may be damaged by a Helper while performing the Services.\n\nPlease report any suspected illegal or unethical behavior by a Helper during the performance of any Services to: [email protected].\n\nReporting and Removal\n\nDolly users may report content to Dolly that they think violates these Terms, and Dolly may remove such content, suspend or terminate the account of the user who posted or otherwise made available such content and/or take additional action to enforce these Terms against such user.\n\nAlso, in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and other applicable law, users may report infringement of their intellectual property, and Dolly will follow the processes outlined in the DMCA to address any reported infringement.\n\nIf you believe that anything on the Dolly Platform infringes upon any copyright that you own or control, you may file a notification with Dolly's Designated Agent as set forth below:\n\nDesignated Agent: Dolly, Inc.\n\nAddress of Designated Agent: 9450 SW Gemini Dr., PMB 43895, Beaverton, Oregon 97008-7105\n\nEmail Address of Designated Agent: [email protected]\n\nFax Number of Designated Agent: 206-494-3198\n\nPhone number of Designated Agent: 206-494-3198\n\nPlease see 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) for the requirements of a proper notification. If you knowingly misrepresent in your notification that the material or activity is infringing, you may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred by Dolly or the alleged infringer as the result of Dolly relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing.\n\nDolly may also at its sole discretion limit access to the Dolly Platform or terminate the accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement. Additionally, Dolly has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at Dolly's sole discretion, subscribers or account holders who are deemed to be repeat infringers.\n\nDolly's Rights\n\nAs between you and Dolly, all information, materials and content of the Dolly Platform, including text, graphics, data, formatting, graphs, designs, HTML, look and feel, photographs, music, sounds, images, software, videos, designs, typefaces, source and object code, format, queries, algorithms and other content is owned by Dolly or is used with permission. When you create, share, link to, or otherwise make available any Requests, you grant us a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such Requests throughout the world in any manner or media, on or off the Dolly Platform. Dolly reserves all rights not expressly set forth in these Terms. You hereby irrevocably waive in favor of Dolly any and all moral rights that you may possess in or to any Requests.\n\nFeedback\n\nAny suggestions, comments or other feedback you give us about the Dolly Platform (the \"Feedback\") will constitute our confidential information. We are free to use, disclose, reproduce, license, distribute and exploit this Feedback as we see fit, without compensation to you or any obligation or restriction because of any intellectual property rights or otherwise.\n\nLocation Information\n\nThe Dolly Platform collects location information and it will be used and disclosed as set forth in the Privacy Policy at https://dolly.com/privacy.\n\nBy accepting these Terms or using the App, the Site(s), or any component of the Dolly Platform, you affirmatively consent to Dolly's collection, use, disclosure and storage of your location information. You may revoke your consent with respect to Dolly's collection, use, disclosure and storage of your location information at any time by deleting the App from your mobile device, or by changing the privacy settings on your mobile device. Please know that if you revoke your consent by doing one of the foregoing or you delete or deactivate your account, we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes. We may also retain cached or archived copies of information about you for a certain period.\n\nIf you consent to our collection of location information and you do not subsequently stop the collection of this location information, Dolly will continue to collect this location information. If you consent to our collection of location information, subsequently stop the collection of this location information and later consent to the collection of this location information, Dolly will resume the collection of location information.\n\nDolly takes reasonable measures to protect your location information from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.\n\nDisclaimers\n\nEXCEPT AS REQUIRED OTHERWISE OF DOLLY BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DOLLY PLATFORM AND EACH COMPONENT THEREOF AND ANYSERVICE, PRODUCT, AND/OR CONTENT INCLUDED ON OR DELIVERED TOGETHER WITH, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OF THE FORGOING ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.\n\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE DISCLAIM AND EXCLUDE ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, AND REPRESENTATIONS (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN), AND ALL OTHER TERMS WHICH MAY BE IMPLIED INTO THESE TERMS BY LAW, WITH RESPECT TO THE DOLLY PLATFORM THE DOLLY PLATFORM AND EACH COMPONENT THEREOF AND ANYSERVICE, PRODUCT, AND/OR CONTENT INCLUDED ON OR DELIVERED TOGETHER WITH, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU.\n\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE DISCLAIM AND EXCLUDE ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, AND REPRESENTATIONS (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN), AND ALL OTHER TERMS WHICH MAY BE IMPLIED INTO THESE TERMS BY LAW, WITH RESPECT TO THE HELPER, THE RESPONSES THEY PROVIDE TO YOU USING THE DOLLY PLATFORM, AND THE SERVICES YOU HIRE THEM TO PROVIDE, WHETHER OR NOT THEY PROVIDE THEM. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS OR REQUIREMENTS.\n\nLimitation of Liability\n\nTO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL DOLLY BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF DATA, PROPERTY (PERSONAL OR PROPERTY), PHYSICAL LOSSES, DEATH, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS, THE DOLLY PLATFORM (INCLUDING THE APP, THE SITE(S), OR RELATED PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR CONTENT, INCLUDING REQUESTS AND RESPONSES TO REQUESTS, HELPERS ACTIONS OR INACTIONS, SERVICES PERFORMED OR NOT PERFORMED BY HELPERS, AND/OR THIRD-PARTY SERVICES OR MATERIALS, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, WHETHER ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR IMPUTED), PRODUCT LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY) AND EVEN IF DOLLY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nSOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\nFOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT EXCLUDED UNDER THESE TERMS, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF DOLLY AND ITS DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AFFILIATES AND INVESTORS WILL NOT EXCEED TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS ($200).\n\nTHESE LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION WILL APPLY ONLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE UNDER LAWS APPLICABLE TO YOU (INCLUDING WHERE RELEVANT THE APPLICABLE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS).\n\nIndemnification\n\nYou will defend us from and against any actual or threatened suits, actions, proceedings (at law or in equity), and claims, and indemnify us for any and all damages, payments, deficiencies, fines, judgments, settlements, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, penalties, interest, and disbursements) arising from or related to any of your Requests and your conduct with respect to the Dolly Platform, requesting or obtaining Services, or your violation (or alleged violation) of these Terms or the rights of any third party by you or any person using your Dolly account.\n\nThird Party Software\n\nThe software you may download (if relevant) consists of a package of components, including certain third party software provided under separate third party license terms. Your use of this third party software in conjunction with the App in a manner consistent with the terms of these Terms is permitted, however, you may have broader rights under the applicable third-party license terms, and nothing in these Terms is intended to impose further restrictions on your use of this third-party software.\n\nChanges to the Dolly Platform\n\nDolly reserves the right in our discretion to review, improve, change or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Sites, the App, components of the Dolly Platform and/or any features, information, materials or content available on the Dolly Platform with or without providing notice to you. Dolly will not be liable to you or any third party for any changes or discontinuance of the Sites, the App, the Dolly Platform (or any part of the Dolly Platform) and/or any features, information, materials or content available on the Dolly Platform.\n\nConsent to Electronic Communications\n\nBy using the Dolly Platform, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding your use of the Dolly Platform and that any notices, agreements, disclosures or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that the communications be in writing. To withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice, please notify us at [email protected].\n\nSuspension and Termination\n\nDolly may suspend or terminate your rights to access or use any and all aspects of the Dolly Platform (including the App) for any reason or for no reason at all and with or without notice at Dolly's discretion. All of the terms of these Terms (excluding the license grant) will survive any termination or suspension.\n\nGoverning Law; Arbitration\n\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH DOLLY AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM DOLLY.\n\nThese Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington and the United States of America, without resort to any conflict of law provisions.\n\nIn the event of any controversy or claim between the Parties, arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms and the subject matter covered by these Terms, you and Dolly agree to consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing your mutual interests, try to reach a solution satisfactory to both parties. If we do not reach settlement within a period of 60 days, then either of us may, by notice to the other demand mediation under the mediation rules of the American Arbitration Association in Seattle, Washington. We both give up our right to litigate our disputes and may not proceed to arbitration without first trying mediation, but you and Dolly are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief from the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Dolly will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.\n\nIf settlement is not reached within 60 days after service of a written demand for mediation, any unresolved controversy or claim will be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association before a single arbitrator in Seattle, Washington. The language of all proceedings and filings will be English. The arbitrator will render a written opinion including findings of fact and law and the award and/or determination of the arbitrator will be binding on the parties, and their respective administrators and assigns, and will not be subject to appeal. Judgment may be entered upon the award of the arbitrator in any court of competent jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration will be shared equally by the parties unless the arbitration determines that the expenses will be otherwise assessed and the prevailing party may be awarded its attorneys' fees and expenses by the arbitrator. It is the intent of the parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances, arbitration proceedings will be concluded within 90 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit only if failure to do so would unduly prejudice the rights of the parties. Failure to adhere to this time limit will not constitute a basis for challenging the award. Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, pre-hearing information exchange will be limited to the reasonable production of relevant, non-privileged documents, carried out expeditiously.\n\nFor any disputes between the Parties that are not handled by arbitration, you agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms and/or the subject matter covered by these Terms shall be filed only in the state and federal courts located in Seattle, Washington and the Parties each hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding between the Parties arising out of or relating these Terms and/or the subject matter covered by these Terms.\n\nGeneral\n\nEnforcement of these Terms is solely at Dolly's discretion. Failure to enforce any part of these Terms in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce the same or other part of these Terms in other instances.\n\nIf any provision of these Terms is or becomes unlawful, void or otherwise unenforceable (including the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations above), then that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.\n\nThe section headings of these Terms are for reference purposes only and will not affect the meaning or interpretation of these Terms.\n\nThese Terms (and terms or policies incorporated herein) make up the entire agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter covered herein, including access and use of Dolly Platform, Requests, and the Services, and they supersede any other terms, whether implied or expressed.\n\nContact Us\n\nIf you have any questions about these Terms, please email us at [email protected] or send a letter to:\n\nDolly, Inc.\n\n9450 SW Gemini Dr., PMB 43895\n\nBeaverton, Oregon 97008-7105\n\nNotice for California Users\n\nIf you are a California resident, you may have these Terms mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to the address above with your electronic mail address and a request for these Terms. Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California Website users are entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 1625 N. Market Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.\n\nNotice Regarding Apple\n\nApple, Inc. and Other Third-Party Beneficiaries. You acknowledge and agree that Apple, Inc. (\"Apple\") and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and further that (a) upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party; (b) these Terms are conducted between you and Dolly only, and not Apple; (c) Dolly, and not Apple, is solely responsible for the Dolly Platform and the content thereof provided by Dolly; (d) Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Dolly Platform; (e) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no warranty obligation with respect to the Dolly Platform; and Dolly, and not Apple, will be responsible for any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure of the Dolly Platform to conform to any applicable warranty; (f) in the event of any third party claim that the Dolly Platform or your possession and use of that Dolly Platform infringes that third party's intellectual property rights, Apple will not be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim; and (g) Apple will not be responsible for addressing any of your claims or any third party claims relating to the Dolly Platform or your possession and/or use of the Dolly Platform, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Dolly Platform fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.\n\nNotice Regarding Damage Protection\n\nPlease note that Damage Protection only applies to the goods being transported. It does not protect damage to the environment surrounding the Dolly (e.g. floors, walls, ceiling, etc.). Additionally, for Damage Protection and insurance purposes, the value of any given item is considered to be the lesser of (a) the price at which it was most recently purchased (last 12 months), or (b) the cost of replacement, as may be reasonably determined by Dolly. Further, the value of such an item is determined independently of the amount of any supplemental Damage Protection purchased from Dolly (in addition to the $300 of complimentary Damage Protection provided by Dolly). For example, if $1,000 of supplemental Damage Protection were purchased, the recent purchase price was $300, and the cost of replacement were $400, then Damage Protection would cover $300. Dolly reserves the right to reject any claims of damage not submitted within 14 days of the damaging incident. Dolly is not responsible for any damage that is incurred outside of the express-written parameters of the move as purchased by the customer. Any act undertaken by our independent contractors that is not explicitly paid for may not qualify for Damage Protection.",

What do I need to know before buying? \n\n\\- Worth / not worth?   \n\\- Can I use any metal rail from Home Depot or does it have to be a speed rail?  \n\\- Is the \"American\" Dana Dolly stands worth it? \n\nWould love some insight from people who've owned and used this extensively.\n\n## Comment ID kezxt48 with +4 score by [(kodachrome16mm, Reddit, 2023-12-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/18rahp9/purchasing_a_dana_dolly_rental_kit/kezxt48/) (in reply to ID 18rahp9):\nWhat makes a dana dolly so great is that you have a slider in your back pocket if a need comes up.\n\nIt’s worse than a dedicated slider, like a good 4 ft or 5 ft one.  And it’s definitely not a dolly replacement, (but try getting the fisher up 4 flights of stairs) but, since your grip truck already should have speedrail in tons of sizes, you’ve got an easy to deploy, quick, slider that only takes up minimal additional space on the truck and can go just about anywhere and be just about any length.\n\nIt really only makes sense if you’re already carrying speedrail, or you’re also getting the portable pipe kit to go along with it.\n\n### Comment ID kezy78x with +1 score by [(ShotbyRonin, Reddit, 2023-12-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/18rahp9/purchasing_a_dana_dolly_rental_kit/kezy78x/) (in reply to ID kezxt48):\nI was planning on just using 4-5' pipes from Home Depot.

They can be finicky, have a large footprint, and are not super smooth compared to a slider, but the ability to change lengths is clutch. Is it worth it? Idk, how much are you gonna use it?\n\nThe american stands are great. I feel like they have less flex than others because of the trough receiver design, but you can't really use them for anything else besides the dana dolly. They have 2 rocky mountain legs instead of 1, so it's easier to level the track.\n\nWhatever stands you get will inevitably be too tall for a lot of shots, so you'll want at least a couple families of apples for that. There is a drop down kit, but it's bouncy, and only works for side-to-side moves, not push-ins/pull-outs. \n\nDon't cheap out and buy some mickey mouse pipe. Get some quality schedule 80 or 40 aluminum pipe, or buy some dedicated pipe that you can screw together to get various lengths. Theres no reason to buy a dana and then cut corners on the cheapest part of the system.\n\n## Comment ID kf1ct2p with +3 score by [(strack94, Reddit, 2023-12-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/18rahp9/purchasing_a_dana_dolly_rental_kit/kf1ct2p/) (in reply to ID 18rahp9):\nAmerican is tried and tested brand in the industry. \n\nI will say that in the professional film world, you rarely see Dana Dollies. They are often more cumbersome to set up and deploy that a traditional slider/dolly. \n\nOf course, your situation might be different and its decent choice for interview style set ups. But your mileage may vary.\n\n## Comment ID kf03m4d with +2 score by [(grandeficelle, Reddit, 2023-12-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/18rahp9/purchasing_a_dana_dolly_rental_kit/kf03m4d/) (in reply to ID 18rahp9):\nI bought one a few years ago and I think I’ve used it twice. It’s too cumbersome for slider moves, and far slower to rig than a  gimbal. It also takes up valuable space in my truck. So for my work, it was a bad buy.\n\n## Comment ID kf0irmq with +2 score by [(robmneilson, Reddit, 2023-12-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/18rahp9/purchasing_a_dana_dolly_rental_kit/kf0irmq/) (in reply to ID 18rahp9):\nYou can use rail from home depot, but its heavy and annoying to lug around. Its worth it to buy nice speed rail at various lengths. Make sure to buy some nice low boys as well. At ~$75-125 rental depending on your market you will make your money back.\n\nQuick to setup and easy to leave on the truck for emergencies. A dedicated slider is better, but the dana is priced nicely and i use mine all the time.\n\n### Comment ID kf0kler with +2 score by [(ShotbyRonin, Reddit, 2023-12-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/18rahp9/purchasing_a_dana_dolly_rental_kit/kf0kler/) (in reply to ID kf0irmq):\nI just got off the phone with the creator/owner of Dana Dolly. REAL nice guy and I'm sold. Ordering now. He informed me I could use any rail but made specific recommendations about what I should look for.  He recommended aluminum schedule 80 pipes.\n\n#### Comment ID kf1dbdt with +1 score by [(robmneilson, Reddit, 2023-12-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/18rahp9/purchasing_a_dana_dolly_rental_kit/kf1dbdt/) (in reply to ID kf0kler):\nCopy that. I believe I bought schedule 40 for my dana to keep the weight down, and keep 4', 5', 6' lengths for it on the truck.\n\n## Comment ID kf2c162 with +2 score by [(Run-And_Gun, Reddit, 2023-12-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/18rahp9/purchasing_a_dana_dolly_rental_kit/kf2c162/) (in reply to ID 18rahp9):\nDana dollys are in that realm of cheap enough to buy to have \"just in case\", but not so expensive that if you only use it once or twice a year it's gonna tick you off that you wasted money.  I have several friends with them, but I've never liked them that much myself, despite their flexibility.  I think they're kind of finicky and a pita to build and move around.  I opted to go with the MYT Works dedicated slider, despite it being a \"one trick pony\" and much more expensive.  Yes, it's a fixed length, but it's quicker to deploy, as it's more or less a single unit and more importantly, it's smoother.  Honestly, I loan mine out to one of my buddies more than I use it.  I don't even carry it in the van, unless it's been requested.  Thank goodness the dolly/slider craze has finally started to subside a bit.  I think I shot on it maybe once in 2023.\n\n## Comment ID kusonwl with +1 score by [(dondidnod, Reddit, 2024-03-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/18rahp9/purchasing_a_dana_dolly_rental_kit/kusonwl/) (in reply to ID 18rahp9):\nI considered owning this...\nfor about 10 seconds.\nNice dream.\n\n\n\nFacebook 3/13/24>Film Gear for Sale>Nick Montalvo\n\n\n\n\nDana Dolly with Matthews stands, 6' speed rails and 4' speedrails $1600 Woodstock, GA\n\n\n\n\nhttps://m.facebook.com/marketplace/item/1845612405881592/",

Dutch actually has a huge amount of regional accents. And even within those regional accents every town and village tends to have it's own variation on it.   \nAs a Dutchman I thought her accent was very convincing. I actually thought she was Dutch, until I googled the actress and found out she is in fact British.   \nI think it's impressive that she went that extra mile to actually pull of a realistic Dutch accent. I mean, lets be honest. 99% of the audience probably would not have noticed if she didn't.  \nWhat also contributed is that she also incorporated some distinctly Dutch characteristics in her mannerisms and general non-verbal communication. There was that (for me) familiar directness/bluntness about her in the way she kinda taunts and mocks Count Dracula. There's no tact or diplomacy. She just goes straight for the jugular.

Still here is her past. Mageseeker is very recent but not quite 'up to date' (as Sylas had not been to the Freljord by that point...but that plot point might no longer be canon?) with Legends of Runeterra being perhaps the most recent point in time we get information about Morgana (her Veiled Lady design in those cards is exquisite!).\n\nLegends of Runeterra introduces Lisa and Dolly, who seem to be a Demacian child mage who controls a magical doll. And based on their card interactions - the way Lisa speaks excitedly to Morgana, there's no fear or reverence, just a child speaking to someone they're comfortable with - Morgana is...teaching her? Caring for her?\n\n===\n\nL+D : \"Miss Mor, miss Mor! Look what I can do!\"\n\nM: \"It is a delight to watch you grow Lisa\"\n\n===\n\nL+D: \"I need to believe that one day, things will be ok\"\n\nM: \"Nothing lasts forever child, not even pain\"\n\n===\n\nBased on the state at the end of Mageseeker (Morgana has connected with the Mages of Demacia and is sympathetic but is not outright helping them directly for fear of drawing down Kayle) and then these cards I am assuming that mages do travel to her hidden grove or she travels to where the mages are hiding (in her guise as the Veiled Lady) and is helping the child mages learn their magic. With Lisa being a particular stand out.\n\nDo we know any more than this? Have I already missed the boat on this discussion and just can't find it?

Also, I have zero clue who/what Dolly is. \n\nThere's also Mihira's (Morgana and Kayle's mother) arrival to speak with her either shortly before or after the Darkin battle between Aatrox, Xolani, Ryze, Kayle, and Mihira. Notably she approaches Morgana in her human form, whereas with Kayle she was in her celestial form. \n\nIt is somewhat curious to me that Morgana knows that if/when she steps into the light once more, Kayle is going to follow. Makes me wonder if she's somehow kept in touch with her sister in some way or if she just \"knows\" based on their roles as twin daughters of Justice that if she comes to judge Demacia, Kayle will naturally be there to do so as well. \n\nAnd...yeah, that's the most recent lore for her. I'm guessing she'll get more once Sylas is released in LoR as well.\n\nEdit: just read Lisa's card text, and she said Dolly taught her something? So I don't know if Dolly being a living doll would make sense.\n\n### Comment ID kiii04w with +1 score by [(Darth_Annoying, Reddit, 2024-01-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/loreofleague/comments/199n7hr/what_is_the_latest_canon_for_morgana_who_are_lisa/kiii04w/) (in reply to ID kiftk7c):\nI thought Mihira was killed by Xoolani.

The quote from Xolaani, Aspect's Bane (the evolved form of Xolaani the Bloodweaver,) simply states that \"Even the great hero of legend Mihira could not withstand Xolaani's overwhelming strength.\"\n\nI re-read all the relevant card texts from the Darkin War release, and couldn't find anything conclusive beyond that.\n\nWe do know that Xolaani was eventually put down by the combined might of the Darkin warriors, Aatrox, Ryze, and Kayle, and Mihira because it was following that when Ryze and Kayle fought Aatrox.\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say that Xolaani injured Mihira to such an extent that she was forced to revert to her mortal form before Xolaani was eventually put down. However, Mihira did not die, which is why we see her in her mortal form when she approaches Morgana.",
      "# Post ID 169pe4: Steadicam vs Dolly vs Tripod vs Shoulder with +4 score by [(mzinz, Reddit, 2013-01-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/169pe4/steadicam_vs_dolly_vs_tripod_vs_shoulder/)\nI'm trying to get a good grip on exactly when I should be using which piece of gear. More than anything, I want to eliminate \"how should I do this\" moments. I'm brand new to videography.\n\nFrom studying films, it seems like shoulder-rigs/handheld is primarily used when there is a lot of movement in the frame, specifically unpredictable movement. When should a tripod be used though?\n\nDollies seem to be used when you want a smooth shot, usually from the side or in-front. I have some confusion on when to use Steadicam vs Dolly, but I'm guessing that  a steadicam should be used when there is no opportunity to put down dolly tracks and/or the movement is very quick?\n\n\n\n## Comment ID c7u6cnz with +2 score by [(Albierio, Reddit, 2013-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/169pe4/steadicam_vs_dolly_vs_tripod_vs_shoulder/c7u6cnz/) (in reply to ID 169pe4):\nA steadicam is what most people use for \"Handheld\" shots. The arm of the steadicam tends to help eliminate the larger jiggles as the arm cushions the impact. For [example](https://vimeo.com/55070023) if i had shot the running scenes in this film with a shoulder mount or handheld, i would be getting the movement of my own hands as well as the movement of my feet. It would be chaotic. With a steadicam, you will still get movement, but it is due to posture rather than shakiness of your own hands. TBQH, i prefer a Steadicam over a shoulder mount. Shoulder mounts are used a bit more as they are usually cheaper and easier to use than a steadicam. A steadicam tends to take a lot of training to pull off correctly. It can also take a ton of time to set up.\n\nA dolly is usually used when you want no human interference with the frame. With a steadicam, you naturally assume a human is holding the camera. With a dolly, it seems more like the camera itself. Dolly's, when set up correctly and leveled, give you a really gorgeous gliding look. \n\nA tripod can really be used for pans and tilts, but is stationary. You shouldn't really move with a tripod. \n\nSorry if i am explaining this oddly or am confusing. It's hard for me to describe how a steadicam works to someone who hasn't used one. I'm a pretty experienced steadicam opperator and would be happy to clarify/answer whatever questions you have. \n\nUltimately, there really isn't a specific right or wrong time to use whatever moving camera gear. They are all tools and should be taken advantage of with the aesthetic and story in mind.\n\n## Comment ID c7u6oxs with +1 score by [(mcarneybsa, Reddit, 2013-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/169pe4/steadicam_vs_dolly_vs_tripod_vs_shoulder/c7u6oxs/) (in reply to ID 169pe4):\nCamera movements are used to help tell the story. If a movement doesn't help further the story - you should probably leave it out.\n\nThe \"over the shoulder\" style is used to bring the viewer into a First Person perspective and drive home any action. It's also very common with documentary filmmaking where you may not be able to set up shots and need to be able to move quickly. \n\nDolly/slider shots (jib/crane shots as well) are generally used as reveals (revealing a character, item, etc that is important), but can also be used to follow action (person walking, car driving down a road, etc) or for emphasis (dolly/slide in/out) especially when combined with an opposite zoom (called a dolly-zoom or \"hitchcock\" zoom).\n\nsteadicams are used to follow the action in a way that doesn't give you a raging headache (like a shoulder rig can do). \n\nTripods are used the rest of the time, don't forget that you can use a tripod. If you are moving the camera just to move the camera, don't. If you feel you need to move the camera to make it more interesting - your content probably sucks (exception being corporate work where the content always sucks and there isn't much you can do about it). The third thing is when you move the camera to add \"production value\" again, its probably because your content sucks (and it's probably for a corporate video).\n\nI use a tripod as often as I can. The times where I don't use a tripod are as follows: If I have a specific \"style\" and When it isn't feasible for me to carry a tripod. I produce lots of content regarding natural resources/wildlife/hunting/fishing and I am a one man production crew. I recently finished a piece shot entirely handheld (except one shot) to match an \"action packed\" style, but I used solid hand-holding technique and active image stabilization to keep the image viewable.\n\nIf you are just starting out and you are considering buying equipment, I recommend a good tripod ($400+) that will support a small slider (edelkrone just came out with a super-portable [slider](http://www.edelkrone.com/slider-plus/) with good range of movement for $500). Remember, buying right the first time means not having to buy again. \n\nhope that helps.\n\n### Comment ID lg1wvrz with +1 score by [(UnpublishedGargantua, Reddit, 2024-08-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/169pe4/steadicam_vs_dolly_vs_tripod_vs_shoulder/lg1wvrz/) (in reply to ID c7u6oxs):\njust found your comment when doing research on dollies. still relevant after 11 years!\n\n## Comment ID kvgmcm2 with +1 score by [(SteadicamOp, Reddit, 2024-03-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/169pe4/steadicam_vs_dolly_vs_tripod_vs_shoulder/kvgmcm2/) (in reply to ID 169pe4):\nYes, Handheld will look shakier and dolly and steadicam will be smooth and a tripod will be static except pan and tilt. [What is steadicam](https://www.benspaner.com/blog/steadicam-strengths-and-weaknesses) good for? Yes tough terrain and also human like movement and curves. Dolly on track is a lot more linear. Over the years Handheld has taken on a feeling of \"real\" because it's used so heavily in documentary. But as a [steadi op](https://www.benspaner.com/) myself I can say that one isn't better than another or should just be used on practical grounds alone. They all give a different feel to the shot which should be used to try to elevate the emotion of the scene. I would suggest experimenting with the different tools and collaborate with your cinematographer and steadicam operator to help find the best way to accomplish your vision.",

Selling a shirt wouldn't qualify. Even the phrase \"I beg your parton\" doesn't qualify as parody. A parody has to make fun of an existing work or person. Parody is not a play off of words. Your slogan doesn't make fun of Dolly Parton, or anything, so it isn't even parody. It's just IP infringement.\n\nEtsy's rules are stricter.

But, you can make a pretty good guess if you do research on parody laws and look into past cases/lawsuits to see what the court decided was parody.\n\n\nEven if something is considered to be parody, [apparently that doesn't automatically make it fair use](https://copyrightalliance.org/is-my-parody-fair-use/).\n\n\n>I don’t understand why they can’t just message us and ask us to delist items.\n\n\n**My guess is that, the reasons for this would be:**\n\n\n\nThey may be taking down a lot of other listings/products for copyright/trademark infringement (possibly hundreds or thousands), and it would take way too much time to message everyone.\n\n\nIf they did message every person who they believed were infringing, then they'd have to keep track of all those people and make sure they follow up with them. Which would be made harder if they are sending takedowns on other sites as well (eBay, Amazon, Temu etc).\n\n\nThey believe they're in the right - sending a takedown immediately solves their problem, but sending a message doesn't immediately solve their problem and it creates more work for them.\n\n\nSending takedowns is standard procedure.

Now Dolly Parton's estate/legal team has two options: ignore the counter notice (which will reinstate your listing*), or sue you.\n\n\nI would think that there's a decent chance they will sue, since that's kind of their only option to defend Dolly Parton's copyright/trademark.\n\n\n*although, since Etsy suspended your store, I'm not sure what would actually happen.\n\n### Comment ID l84ua8v with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsySellers/comments/1dd5fff/my_etsy_shop_was_just_shutdownby_dolly_parton/l84ua8v/) (in reply to ID l84p85w):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID l85dm90 with +1 score by [(U_Basic, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsySellers/comments/1dd5fff/my_etsy_shop_was_just_shutdownby_dolly_parton/l85dm90/) (in reply to ID l84p85w):\nThe appeal is with Etsy to try and reopen my shop, not to try to relist the item.\n\n#### Comment ID l86ix0m with +1 score by [(ARBlackshaw, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsySellers/comments/1dd5fff/my_etsy_shop_was_just_shutdownby_dolly_parton/l86ix0m/) (in reply to ID l85dm90):\nOkay, that's good 👍\n\n## Comment ID l84u1ae with +6 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsySellers/comments/1dd5fff/my_etsy_shop_was_just_shutdownby_dolly_parton/l84u1ae/) (in reply to ID 1dd5fff):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID l85e6jp with +2 score by [(U_Basic, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsySellers/comments/1dd5fff/my_etsy_shop_was_just_shutdownby_dolly_parton/l85e6jp/) (in reply to ID l84u1ae):\nThe listing didn’t have her name in it.\n\n## Comment ID l84moli with +3 score by [(shnugsly, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsySellers/comments/1dd5fff/my_etsy_shop_was_just_shutdownby_dolly_parton/l84moli/) (in reply to ID 1dd5fff):\nJust out of curiosity was your entire shop based on Dolly Parton?

My understanding is that Etsy takes numerous factors into consideration - like how far apart the takedowns are (e.g. three takedowns in one year vs three takedowns over 10 years), the age of the shop, and if the shop has broken other Etsy policies. But Etsy is not transparent on all the factors.\n\n#### Comment ID l84spgk with +3 score by [(shnugsly, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsySellers/comments/1dd5fff/my_etsy_shop_was_just_shutdownby_dolly_parton/l84spgk/) (in reply to ID l84q8x9):\nI know lol, that's why I was asking OP.

It depends on your camera movement as well as whats on the ground, but it's not that hard to get rid of dolly tracks on the floor. I wouldn't necessarily say it's \"psudo easy\" unless you have the experience/practice under your belt. For a capable person like myself I could knock out a 5 second shot in like 20 minutes. \n\nIf you look at a video like this:\nhttps://vimeo.com/75900695\n\nskip to about 1:40 you'll see how it's done, it's essentially a matte painting and tracking. As long as no one steps in front of it then you should be fine. You won't have to rotoscope them. \n\nPaint a still frame from a PSD export, motion track the footage in mocha and then composite in After effects. \n\nFeel free to ask or PM me with more VFX questions.\n\n### Comment ID ct8efli with +1 score by [(120_pages, Reddit, 2015-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/3dsgyh/removal_of_dolly_tracks_in_post/ct8efli/) (in reply to ID ct8amut):\nThis s a good method to remove dolly tracks.  Remember to shoot a clean plate from the appropriate angle before the track is laid down.  That will make replacement much less time-consuming.\n\n## Comment ID ct882ys with +8 score by [(swoofswoofles, Reddit, 2015-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/3dsgyh/removal_of_dolly_tracks_in_post/ct882ys/) (in reply to ID 3dsgyh):\nWhat about using another tool out there that doesn't require track to be in the shot?

I'm not saying I know everything but it's literally the first time I've heard anyone suggest that. It sounds like an impossibility, and I don't know a single grip that would suggest such a thing. \n\nEdit:\nHere's an image of what your leveling might look like before you even put camera on the dolly:\nhttp://www-tc.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/weshallremain/img/gallery/geronimo/large/005.jpg\n\nIf you're in the forest or any particularly uneven terrain, using wedges, Apple boxes, basso blocks, or cribbing (1x3's and 2x4's), leveling your track could be a bit of work, ranging between 20 mins to an hour depending on the move you have. That's not including rehearsals, looking for actor and camera marks, lighting the shot, etc. it takes an experienced eye to level track well and efficiently. Not to mention, you gotta fly in a 4' long level, front to back, and side to side like a grip ninja katana! \n\nThat's why it seems like an impractical idea to attempt to \"add track\" within the shot, or to \"remove track\" and all the leveling blocks and wedges that it required, all without disturbing the sound department or the actors or camera operators or directors and producers looking at the shot. \n\nTracks are heavy and pointy. They're also expensive and precisely machined. They should be handled with care; best to not rush to fly them in or out of situations. \n\nAdditionally, never handle dolly gear or grip gear for that matter unless a grip says it's okay to do so. :) thanks guys. Hope the explanation helps, even though it's not a solution to your problem. \n\nLastly though, I think you're on the right track (ha.. Grip jokes). I worked on a student shoot, very VFX heavy, they painted out a 50' track run AND cloned in a small crowd several times, a la a long tunnel of people.\n\n#### Comment ID ct8ej37 with +2 score by [(b19pen15, Reddit, 2015-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/3dsgyh/removal_of_dolly_tracks_in_post/ct8ej37/) (in reply to ID ct8c0ou):\nThey added and removed tracks for a shot in Gus Van Sant's Last Days. I would say it's mostly impractical though, it only worked on that film because the shot was purposefully long and the push in was incredibly slow, so they had ample time with the tracks. \n\n[Here's a link to the behind the scenes](http://youtu.be/ol9j_7Rywno).\n\n#### Comment ID ct8oyr8 with +1 score by [(listyraesder, Reddit, 2015-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/3dsgyh/removal_of_dolly_tracks_in_post/ct8oyr8/) (in reply to ID ct8c0ou):\nAll good, but removing track during a take has been done since the 1930s at least, with track that folds out and back on itself like a zipper. Levelling becomes your issue, but I wouldn't say it was impractical given certain smart choices for location, or prep-work. \n\nAn easier solution may be to dolly trackless on boards and have them flown out once the dolly's clear. The levelling can be nailed to the boards meaning an easy one-piece removal.\n\n### Comment ID ct88q8a with +1 score by [(InItsTeeth, Reddit, 2015-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/3dsgyh/removal_of_dolly_tracks_in_post/ct88q8a/) (in reply to ID ct88omp):\nIt might be.

      "# [Barbra Streisand, Dolly Parton lead Kris Kristofferson tributes by Carson Blackwelder, ABC News on 2024-09-30](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/barbra-streisand-dolly-parton-lead-kris-kristofferson-tributes/story?id=114349679)\nDolly Parton and Barbra Streisand are among those mourning the death of Kris Kristofferson.\n\nThe Grammy-winning country music artist and actor died \"peacefully in his home in Maui, Hawaii,\" on Saturday, his family shared via a statement posted to his official Facebook account on Sunday. He was 88.\n\nLeading the tributes for Kristofferson were some the likes of Parton, a longtime and frequent collaborator of his, and Streisand, who famously shared the screen with him in 1976's \"A Star Is Born.\"\n\n\"What a great loss. What a great writer. What a great actor. What a great friend,\" Parton wrote in a statement posted to Instagram. \"I will always love you.\"\n\nStreisand shared an image of the \"A Star Is Born\" soundtrack and a photo of her and Kristofferson performing together in London in 2019 alongside her Instagram tribute.\n\n\"The first time I saw Kris performing at the Troubadour club in L.A. I knew he was something special. Barefoot and strumming his guitar, he seemed like the perfect choice for a script I was developing, which eventually became A Star Is Born,\" she wrote. \"In the movie, Kris and I sand the song I'd written for the film's main love theme, 'Evergreen.'\"\n\n\"For my latest concert in 2019 at London's Hyde Park, I asked Kris to join me on-stage to sing our other A Star Is Born duet, 'Lost Inside of You.' He was as charming as ever, and the audience showered him with applause. It was a joy seeing him receive the recognition and love he so richly deserved,\" she continued. \"My thoughts go to Kris' wife, Lisa who I know supported him in every way possible.\"\n\nSee how other stars are remembering Kristofferson below:\n\nReba McEntire: \"What a gentleman, kind soul, and a lover of words. I am so glad I got to meet him and be around him. One of my favorite people. Rest in peace, Kris,\" Reba McEntire wrote on Instagram.\n\nRosanne Cash: \"Here was a man. A man I knew most of my life. A piece of my heart and family history. I expected he'd leave the planet fairly soon but it doesn't change the magnitude of the loss. And yet we will always have him — his enormous legacy, his resonant spirit, the lasting power of his authenticity, his staggering gifts as a poet — in word, on screen, in his being. For the last several decades, there was no Kris without Lisa and her beauty and steadfastness is a constant inspiration. I send you all my love, Lisa. Travel safe, dear brother. I will always love you,\" Rosanne Cash wrote on Instagram.\n\nTravis Tritt: \"Sad to hear of Kris Kristofferson's passing. He was an inspiration to me and I was fortunate to get to know him on the set of 'Outlaw Justice' that we filmed in Spain in 1998. My heartfelt condolences go out to Kris's wife, Lisa and all of his family, friends and fans,\" Travis Tritt shared on Instagram.\n\nDiane Warren: \"Brilliant songwriter, Rhodes scholar, great actor, not to mention criminally handsome. How often do U get all that in one human? Write in Power forever Kris Kristofferson. We are losing too many greats and we just lost another one,\" Diane Warren wrote on Instagram.\n\nDakota Fanning: \"This legend was so good to me when we worked together on Dreamer. What an honor to have spent time in his presence,\" Dakota Fanning wrote in an Instagram story.\n\nMelissa Etheridge: \"Loved this man, his talent, his mind and his beautiful heart. Journey well, my friend,\" Melissa Etheridge wrote on Instagram.\n\nDarius Rucker: \"We lost one of the kindest most beautiful souls that God gave us. I will miss u my friend. I love u Kriss. I just love u man!!\" Darius Rucker shared on X, formerly Twitter.",
      "# [Dolly Parton's theme park, Dollywood, hit by \"unprecedented flooding event\" that injured at least 1 by Emily Mae Czachor on 2024-07-29](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dollywood-dolly-parton-theme-park-flash-flooding/)\nThunderstorms rocked portions of eastern Tennessee on Sunday, dumping heavy rain and flash flooding to Dolly Parton's amusement park, Dollywood. At least one person was injured, officials said.\n\nIt wasn't clear on Monday morning exactly how much water had inundated the park or the extent of the damage it caused, but the park's public relations director, Wes Ramey, told CBS News that storms had dumped almost five inches of rain onto Dollywood over the course of just an hour. Ramey described the situation as \"an unprecedented flooding event.\"\n\nVideo recorded inside Dollywood and submitted to CBS News affiliate WVLT during Sunday's deluge appeared to show groups of people wading through knee-deep water in some places. The police department in Pigeon Forge, where Dollywood is located, said in a statement on Sunday night on social media that McCarter Hollow Road, at the park's entrance, had collapsed and was closed to traffic. There was an alternate route that people in the area could use instead, according to police.\n\nRamey confirmed that Dollywood was scheduled to reopen at 12 p.m. local time on Monday, as park officials had said in an initial statement on their response to the flooding Sunday evening.\n\n\"This afternoon, Sunday, July 28, a strong thunderstorm caused flash flooding at Dollywood,\" Dollywood Parks and Resortssaid in the earlier statement. \"With the assistance of Pigeon Forge Police and Fire Departments, park personnel directed guests to safety during the storm. At this time, one minor injury has been reported.\"\n\nOfficials didn't elaborate on the nature of that injury. They said Dollywood was \"supporting guests whose vehicles were affected\" by the weather and crews had been deployed to clean up the area.\n\n\"While the volume of rain was difficult for both the park's and the city's infrastructure to manage, the fact we have only one minor injury illustrates how well our hosts handled the situation and how well our guests followed their directions,\" Ramey told CBS News about an hour before Dollywood was set to reopen. \"We will evaluate the response to determine if any changes are needed moving forward, but we are proud of our maintenance and operations teams for their hard work that allowed us to reopen less than 24 hours after an unprecedented flooding event like this one.\"\n\nThe park will honor guests' Sunday tickets for admission on Monday, or provide rain checks for a future visit, Ramey said.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Morristown issued a flash flood warning for Pigeon Forge that remained in place until around 11 p.m. on Sunday. Many roads around Dollywood that shut down because of the storms, including in nearby Sevier County, reopened around the same time the weather service lifted its warning.",

      "# [Dolly Parton gives inside look at new Dollywood attraction, shares why it makes her \"so emotional\" by Anthony Mason, Analisa Novak on 2024-07-09](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dolly-parton-dollywood-exhibit-the-dolly-parton-experience-tennesee-music-career/)\nDollywood recently unveiled its latest attraction, The Dolly Parton Experience, celebrating the life, career and fashion of the country music legend. The new exhibits opened as Dollywood was named Tripadvisor's No. 1 theme park in the U.S. and among their top 10 attractions worldwide in 2024.\n\nThe exhibits inside Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, showcase Parton's iconic costumes, including her famous high heels.\n\n\"I'm a big shoe person 'cause I'm so short,\" Parton joked in an interview that aired Tuesday on \"CBS Mornings.\"\n\nVisitors can engage interactively by \"Dressing Dolly,\" choosing Parton's wardrobe and selecting a guitar for her.\n\n\"I dress her every day,\" Parton said with a laugh as she strolled through the attraction.\n\nParton said she had the idea of the experience for years, and now that it has come to life, she feels overwhelmed by the exhibit's scope.\n\n\"You know how they say sometimes that when you start to die, your whole life flashes before you?\" she said. \"Well, it about killed me going through there 'cause I got so emotional.\"\n\nSongwriting legacy\n\nParton's songwriting, which began in her childhood, is a central theme of the exhibit. It's something she has always believed in, with encouragement from her mother, who was fascinated by Parton's songwriting capabilities. Parton says her skill with the pen is her most important.\n\n\"I take myself more serious as a songwriter than anything else. And if I had to give up every other part of the business, I would choose to be a writer,\" she said. \"Because that's my therapist. My guitar is my friend.\"\n\nThe music icon still gets excited when she comes up with a good lyric. Sometimes, when Parton thinks of a good line, she feels it must be divine inspiration. That was the case for one of her most famous lines. \"Tumble out of bed and I stumble to the kitchen, pour myself a cup of ambition,\" the opening lines from her 1980 hit \"9 to 5\" came to her quickly.\n\n\"That just rolled right out. I hadn't even thought about that,\" she said. \"When I thought of that one, I went, wow, that's - that's as good as this cup of coffee's going to be.\"\n\nNotable career moments\n\nParton was determined to make it in the music industry. Despite initial resistance from Nashville, Parton said her perseverance never wavered.\n\n\"Giving up ain't in me,\" she asserted.\n\nThe exhibit features notable moments from her career, including her collaboration with Porter Wagoner starting in 1967. Her appearances on his TV show significantly boosted her popularity. She became so popular, she said, that Wagoner didn't want her to leave, but Parton had other plans and wrote him a song - \"I Will Always Love You.\"\n\nWhen she played, \"I Will Always Love You,\" for him, he was moved to tears and told her it was the best song she had ever written. He agreed to let her go if he could produce it, and she did.\n\nParton later heard that Elvis Presley wanted to record the song, but his manager, Colonel Tom Parker, demanded all the publishing rights. She refused.\n\n\"I said, 'Well, it's gonna be the biggest heartbreak of my life. You can't have it. I can't do that 'cause this is my most important copyright,'\" said Parton. Priscilla Presley later told Parton that Elvis was singing it to her as they walked down the courthouse steps during their divorce.\n\nBeyoncé's take on \"Jolene\"\n\nParton's music continues to resonate across generations, with her songs covered by artists like Beyoncé. Parton said she's proud of Beyoncé's interpretation of \"Jolene\" on her latest album, \"Cowboy Carter.\"\n\n\"I was just assuming it was gonna be that you know, 'Jolene' the traditional way. But when I heard it, I thought, 'Wow boy, she put a lot into that.' And that was a great album of hers, by the way,\" said Parton.\n\nAs Parton reflected on her career, she expressed hope for more projects in the future, including the Broadway musical based on her life story.\n\n\"I'm on my last chapter because of my age and everything, but I want [it] to really be the best one,\" she said. \"I want the story to end really well.\"",
      "# [Dolly Parton is sending free books to children across 21 states — and around the world by HEATHER HOLLINGSWORTH, BRUCE SCHREINER on 2024-08-27](https://apnews.com/article/dolly-parton-children-books-states-program-5aa502c1905babd9604e9b3588942995)\nDolly Parton’s father grew up poor and never got the chance to learn to read.\n\nInspired by her upbringing, the 78-year-old country music legend has made it her mission over the past three decades to improve literacy through her Imagination Library book giveaway program. It has expanded statewide in places like Missouri and Kentucky, two of 21 states where all children under the age of 5 can enroll to have books mailed to their homes monthly.\n\nTo celebrate, she made stops Tuesday in both states to promote the program and tell the story of her father, Robert Lee Parton, who died in 2000.\n\n“In the mountains, a lot of people never had a chance to go to school because they had to work on the farms,” she said at the Folly Theater in Kansas City, Missouri. “They had to do whatever it took to keep the rest of the family going.”\n\nParton, the fourth of 12 children from a poor Appalachian family, said her father was “one of the smartest people I’ve ever known,” but he was embarrassed that he couldn’t read.\n\nAnd so she decided to help other kids, initially rolling out the program in a single county in her home state of Tennessee in 1995. It spread quickly from there, and today over 3 million books are sent out each month. Since the program started, books have been sent to more than 240 million to kids in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia.\n\nMissouri covers the full cost of the program, which totaled $11 million in the latest fiscal year. Most of the other states chip in money through a cost-sharing model.\n\n“The kids started calling me the ‘book lady,’” Parton said. “And Daddy was more proud of that than he was that I was a star. But Daddy got to feeling like he had really done something great as well.”\n\nIn Kentucky, the Imagination Library reaches children in all 120 counties, Gov. Andy Beshear said at an event Tuesday with Parton. More than 120,000 Kentucky children — nearly half of all preschoolers in the state — are currently enrolled to receive books through the program, first lady Britainy Beshear said.\n\nIt encourages families to read together, and it allows children to have their own personal library before starting kindergarten, at no cost to their families, the first lady said.\n\n“It’s really a great way to teach children when they’re very young to learn to love books and to learn to read,” Parton said during the event in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nParton, who earned the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award a decade ago, said she eventually wants to see the program in every state. While there is a presence in all of them, 21 have legislation ensuring all kids under 5 can enroll. She said she is proud that her dad lived long enough to see the program get off the ground.\n\n“That was kind of my way to honor my dad, because the Bible says to honor your father and mother,” she said. “And I don’t think that just means, ‘just obey.’ I think it means to bring honor to their name and to them.”\n\nParton is an author herself whose titles include the 1996 children’s book “Coat of Many Colors,” which is part of the book giveaway program.\n\nAs she prepared to sing her famous song by the same name, she explained that it is about a coat her mother made her from a patchwork of mismatched fabric, since the family was too poor to afford a large piece of a single fabric. Parton was proud of it because her mother likened it the multicolored coat that is told about in the Bible — a fantastic gift from Jacob to his son Joseph.\n\nClassmates, however, laughed at her. For years, she said the experience was a “deep, deep hurt.”\n\nShe said that with writing and performing the song, “the hurt just left me.” She received letters over the years from people saying it did the same thing for them.\n\n“The fact,” she explained, “that that little song has just meant so much not only to me, but to so many other people for so many different reasons, makes it my favorite song.”\n\nAsked in Kentucky about her lasting legacy, Parton said she’d like to be remembered as “a good ole girl” who worked hard and tried to make people happy and the world a better place.\n\n“Of course I want to be known as a songwriter and a singer, but I honestly can say that the Imagination Library has meant as much, if not more, to me than nearly anything that I’ve ever done,” she said.\n\n___\n\nHollingsworth reported from Mission, Kansas.

For some songs, audio from family members who have died are also incorporated into the music, like contributions by Reverend Jake Owens, Parton’s late grandfather.\n\n“I cannot believe that it has been 60 years this month since I graduated from Sevier County High School and moved to Nashville to pursue my dreams,” Parton previously shared in a statement. “My Uncle Bill Owens was by my side for many years helping me develop my music. I owe so much to him and all the family members past and present who have inspired me along this journey. I am honored to spotlight our families’ musical legacy that is my Smoky Mountain DNA.”\n\nSmoky Mountain DNA – Family, Faith & Fables arrives November 15 and will be accompanied by a four-part docuseries tracing Parton’s musical lineage. The album, available to preorder now, will also be released on “Appalachian Autumn” colored vinyl in a limited run of only 3,363, the coordinates of family’s Tennessee Mountain Home in Locust Ridge, TN (36 degrees North and 83 degrees West).\n\nTrending\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nDolly Parton & Family: Smoky Mountain DNA – Family, Faith & Fables Track List\n\n1.

      "# [Covering Dolly Parton and Dollywood while living in Knoxville is a joyful privilege by Devarrick Turner on 2024-08-27](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/opinion/2024/08/27/the-privilege-of-covering-dolly-parton-and-dollywood-in-knoxville/74833032007/)\nWhen I first started as a reporter at Knox News with an emphasis on entertainment and culture reporting, there was always a tease of a Dolly Parton interview. It felt like an elusive opportunity that might or might not happen.\n\nLike most of the world, I was already a big fan of Dolly’s music and her personality. I grew up singing “Jolene” and Whitney Houston’s version of “I Will Always Love You.”\n\nBut what I did not realize was just how special it is to cover Dollywood and the iconic figure behind it in the place she grew up and will always call home, especially at a time when the two cultural cornerstones are better than ever.\n\nDolly Parton's Dollywood is the best:Here's how it’s growing bigger and better\n\nEast Tennessee loves Dolly(wood)\n\nDollywood isn’t just a theme park. It’s a joyful noise of fun, family, cinnamon bread and Appalachian culture.\n\nI’ve had the privilege of having a front row seat to its growth over the past few years, such as the launch of its most expensive roller coaster, Big Bear Mountain, the opening of The Dolly Parton Experience museum, and HeartSong Lodge and Resort welcoming its first guests.\n\nMost important, I see how our local community is deeply connected to the beloved theme park and invested in its success. The park is vital to East Tennessee’s tourism and economy, significantly contributing to the growth of the region for nearly four decades.\n\nIt's also an extremely cool hangout spot, especially when discounted tickets and special deals are often available to East Tennessee residents.\n\nAnd Knoxville loves Dolly!\n\nThe vibrant mural of the Queen of Country by Megan Lingerfelt on Strong Alley is admired by all strolling through the heart of Downtown Knoxville. The annual Rhinestone Fest (formerly known as Dolly Fest) is a Dolly-inspired weekend full of music, movies, art and fun where everyone is encouraged to come dressed in their best Dolly outfits and wigs.\n\nRALA in Old City has a collection of goods and gifts crafted by local and regional artists. Loads of Dolly-themed items are available, including artwork. RALA hosts the Dolly Art Contest each year. Dolly artwork by nearly 40 local artists fills up a wall inside the store. I’ve been blown away by the creativity and talent of each piece in the art show every year.\n\nLove and appreciation for Dolly starts early in Knoxville. The Knox County Public Library participates in Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library program, helping provide free books to children 5 and younger. Any family in Knox County can sign up their children at any Knox County library, by calling 865-215-8743 or online at knoxcountylibrary.org.\n\nChasing Dolly Parton as a reporter\n\nLike the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, the Tennessee Valley Authority and Knoxville’s business scene, there’s always something going on with Dolly Parton. She’s released a brand of wines, a new cookbook is out, more baking mixes have hit grocery store shelves, or maybe there’s a secret collaboration with Beyoncé!\n\nNot even joking, as I write this, I just received a notification on my phone about Dolly’s new beauty line.\n\n“I believe beauty comes from within, but a little red lipstick never hurt. #DollyBeauty is available now!” reads the post on X, formerly called Twitter.\n\nThough she retired from touring a couple of years ago, Dolly’s already legendary career has skyrocketed. Not only through product deals, but because of her music and a well-maintained cultural significance.\n\n“Rockstar,” her first rock album, came out last year and was her highest-charting album debut ever, hitting No. 1 on three Billboard charts. And she released a duet with singer Post Malone earlier this month, in addition to recently working with Beyoncé and rapper Pitbull.\n\nThanks to her ever-expanding empire, those elusive Dolly interviews did eventually come my way. She’s exactly as you’d imagine, and we’ve been able to have fun chats about her new projects, Dollywood, and her love of the Great Smoky Mountains.\n\nLast year, the USA TODAY Network hired reporters to specifically cover pop star moguls Taylor Swift and Beyoncé. Here in Knoxville, I’ve become the “Dollywood/Dolly Parton reporter.” It’s an unofficial title but being able to share stories on the growing popular theme park and its namesake with our readers has been a wonderful experience professionally and personally.\n\nIt’s evident how much Dolly and Dollywood mean to the people of East Tennessee. She means the same to us. Definitely check Knox News regularly. You never know what exciting news Dolly has to share with next.\n\nDevarrick Turner is a trending news reporter.

      "# [Federalist writer regrets saying Dolly Parton had a false gospel by Staff Reports on 2024-06-11](https://vicksburgnews.com/federalist-writer-regrets-saying-dolly-parton-had-a-false-gospel/)\nDolly Parton’s fans defended the country music icon after an essay on the Federalist conservative news site attacked her faith. The essay targeted the 78-year-old “Jolene” singer for her support of the LGBTQ community earlier this week.\n\nThe headline, “There’s Nothing Loving About Dolly Parton’s False Gospel,” caught many people off guard. Consequently, supporters flooded social media with critical messages about the essay. In response to the backlash, the writer expressed regret for using such a beloved figure to make her point.\n\nFederalist writer Ericka Andersen criticized Parton for her nonjudgmental approach to life. Specifically, Andersen took issue with Parton’s claim that she loves everyone, including members of the LGBTQ community. Furthermore, Parton has shown support for these communities in interviews.\n\nAdditionally, Andersen argued that if Parton is a Christian, as she proclaims, she should call out homosexuality as a sin. Andersen stated, “Parton’s version of love, which includes condoning immoral sexual behavior (‘be who you are,’ she’s said), is unaligned with God’s vision for humanity.”\n\nMoreover, Andersen told Yahoo Entertainment on Saturday that the widespread backlash made her realize she shouldn’t have used Parton to press her argument.\n\n“I regret using Dolly as the example for the point I was making in the article,” she said. “As I wrote in the piece, I love her and think she does some incredible things for the world. We all make poor choices in how to frame things sometimes. This was one of those moments for me! Dolly is one of the few people who is beloved by all and who loves all. The world is lucky to have her.”",

(LEX 18) — Dolly Parton wowed a packed house at the Lyric Theatre and Cultural Arts Center with an acapella version of \"A Coat of Many Colors,\" but she wasn't just in Lexington for a performance.\n\nHer visit on Tuesday was a celebration of her program “Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library.”\n\nThe program gives away free books each month to kids from birth until the start of kindergarten and is now in all 120 Kentucky counties.\n\n“Of course I want to be remembered as a songwriter and a singer but i can honestly say...certainly anything in my charity work,” Parton said.\n\nParton sat down with Governor Andy Beshear and First Lady Brittainy Beshear to discuss the program's impact.\n\n“Did you ever even dream it would get this big?” Beshear asked.\n\n“No. You never think at the time, I just wanted to do something for my daddy,” Parton replied.\n\nParton started Imagination Library in 1995 as a way to honor her father, Lee.\n\nSince then, the organization has given away 240 million books. Parton even gifted Kentucky a special book, a copy of \"Coat of Many Colors.\"\n\nIn return, this East Tennessee girl was made a Kentucky Colonel.",

A crushing disease for the afflicted, family and friends, as well as caregivers, consider giving to the cause of your liking.\n\nDolly was born June 24, 1950, in Lake Forest, Ill., to parents Dale and Lois Jerik. Shortly after, the close-knit family made the move to Ironwood, where her father worked for the Railway Express Agency and then created a camper/RV sales and service company. She graduated from Luther L. Wright High School in 1968. While Dolly was attending Gogebic College, she was swept off her feet by this guy, with whom many of you are acquainted. We were married in Ironwood on Aug. 29, 1970. Shortly after, we were subsequently blessed, most of the time, with our two boys, Geoffrey and Billy.\n\nA self-made woman, Dolly ventured into banking after a stint with Kluggnes Electronics. She later progressed to become President of the Iron Mountain-Kingsford Community Federal Credit Union.\n\nA few years later, she informed me that she was running for the elected office of Dickinson County Clerk! The first campaign effort fell just short, but the next try she succeeded. History was made, and 30 years later, she received several commendations from the State of Michigan for her service. She succeeded in a man’s world, a male-dominated profession, and I am proud of her achievements! She was honored to be Grand Marshall in the 2021 4th of July parade in Dickinson County. Health problems began shortly after her retirement, yet we managed one more Amtrak adventure in 2022. We took our granddaughters on the Amtrak out of Milwaukee for a night in downtown Chicago. Dolly and I then boarded the California Zephyr for a round-robin to San Francisco and Seattle, and back home. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to travel together.\n\nDolly loved spending time with her friends, family and pets. She loved Dickinson County, serving her community, and she loved her country with pride. Dolly enjoyed politics, reading, fishing, the occasional golf outing, gardening, true crime and traveling on Amtrak. She enjoyed the sunshine as well as feeding her many backyard critters. Dolly especially cherished time with her two granddaughters.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents, Dale and Lois Jerik; brothers-in-law, Ray Emmrich and Clifton Cook; sister-in-law, Tina Jerik; and in-laws, James and Lily Cook.\n\nDolly is survived by her husband, Bill Cook of Iron Mountain; her sons, Bill (Heidi) Cook of Aurora, Wis., and Geoffrey (Brittany) Cook of Appleton, Wis.; granddaughters, Indie and Ivy Cook of Appleton; one sister, Jeri Emmrich of Hurley, Wis.; brothers, Dan (Candy) Jerik of Minneapolis and Bob Jerik of Kenosha, Wis.; many nieces and nephews whom she adored; not to mention many special friends.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held from 3 to 9 p.m. on Friday, July 12 at the Iron Mountain City Park Pavilion. Food and drinks will be provided.\n\nMany thanks to Dr. Schroeder and Michigan-Wisconsin Family Practice, Dr. Shanelli Fernando and Associates at ThedaCare Cancer, Dr. Wald at ThedaCare Pulmonary, Dr. Cynthia Geocaris and Dr. Shannon Schmidt and the staff at ThedaCare, and the gal that came to our home to obtain blood from Dolly. A heartfelt thank you to Laura from Arcadia Home Care for her soothing manner that I am convinced pulled Dolly from a coma and gave us one more day to communicate with her. If I have forgotten to mention any of you, be assured I haven’t forgotten you!\n\nFriends may leave condolences and tributes to Dolly’s family online at www.jacobsfuneralhomes.com.\n\nThe family has chosen Jacobs Funeral Home of Iron Mountain to honor Dolly’s legacy of life.",

Dolly was a first cousin of mine (Sylvia) on the Longenecker side. Since she was such a talented musician and director, she served as a role model for me during my high school years. I sang in The Florin Church of the Brethren Senior Choir Dolly was directing then. Later on, after I earned my degree in music ed., I directed that choir, as well. When I first assumed that job, I often thought, \"How would Dolly do it?\" When Glenn and I married, naturally, I asked Dolly to sing at the wedding. We sort of lost contact after that, but will cherish the memories we do have.

      "# [Johnny, June, Mrs. Doubtfire, and Dolly by LGBTQSD COUNTY NEWS, lgbtqsd.news on 2024-07-05](https://lgbtqsd.news/johnny-june-mrs-doubtfire-and-dolly/)\nCurtain Call\n\nby Chris Barone\n\nAs we approach Pride season, it’s been quite a busy month for me as we prepare Baja Betty’s for our 20th Pride, however, I was still able to enjoy two great productions right here in our own backyard.\n\nI will never be too busy to spend an afternoon or evening at the theater. For me, the month of June included the direct-from-Broadway production of Mrs. Doubtfire at The San Diego Civic Theater and the world premiere musical, The Ballad of Johnny and June at La Jolla Playhouse.\n\nHellooooooo!\n\nFirst, let me discuss Mrs. Doubtfire. For the most part, it was the movie live onstage with all of the beloved scenes from the film. Not a shocker. The book writers, Karen Kirkpatrick and John O’Farrell, definitely kept that in mind when constructing this and it didn’t disappoint the audience. They knew their audience going in and stayed true to the source material. Many of the jokes and the physical comedy are a tribute to the late, ever-so-brilliant Robin Williams, who originally created the role.\n\nIn this day and age, where so many movies are being adapted for the stage, this was really an enjoyable one. It manages to capture the two most important aspects of the movie: heart and humor. I feel like several of the “cookie cutter” shows or jukebox musicals lack that, so I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nWhat else can I say except that Tony nominee Rob McClure is a tour de force as the title character. Wow! He would have 100% gotten my vote for “Best Actor in a Musical” if I was a Tony voter when he was nominated in 2022. He never stopped moving and owning both of his characters; Daniel Hillard and the one and only, Mrs. Doubtfire. I’m still baffled how he could switch back and forth between his characters with such honest and believable ease. I absolutely adored him. Kudos.\n\nWith that being said, I have a great story to share about the amazing Rob McClure …\n\nI was scheduled for my annual spring jaunt to The Broadway at the end of March 2020. Well, we all know what happened and needless to say, my butt sat on my couch in San Diego instead of inside a theater in NYC. The world closed down and I was stuck at home in my apartment when I should have been roaming the streets of New York and checking off all of the Broadway shows that I was waiting to see. One that I had tickets for was Mrs. Doubtfire. Anyway, knowing how sad I was, I got the most wonderful and thoughtful gift from my pals, Darcy and Joey. Imagine my surprise when I get a personal Cameo from Rob McClure himself! He said the kindest things and shared my sadness for the closure of Broadway. I’ll never forget his optimism and hopefulness about the return of Broadway because at that point, we had no idea how long it would be closed. Who would have ever guessed that it would close down for 18 months?\n\nThe young actors that portrayed the kids were fabulous. It’s quite impressive to see the huge amounts of talent in the youth on stage these days. They’re the future of musical theater and were all very promising. The supporting characters (including McClure’s real life wife, Maggie Lakis, as Miranda) were all great in their portrayal but honestly, I couldn’t focus on anyone else if Daniel/Mrs. Doubtfire was in the scene. The ensemble were all fabulous, too. A strong company of actors that could sing, dance and keep the show’s transitions moving effortlessly.\n\nAlso included in the cast is the incomparable Jonathan Hoover, who is the best Patti LuPone impersonator ever. Please check out his Instagram, @inappropriatepatti. A night at the theater is even better when you have a friend in the show. Thanks, Jonathan!\n\nCashing In\n\nNext up was the world premiere of the musical, The Ballad of Johnny and June at The La Jolla Playhouse, directed by Tony award winner and LJP favorite, Des McAnuff.\n\nAs a lifelong fan of country music, I was already familiar with the story of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. I’m a sucker for a love story and this one is definitely one for the ages. With a live band onstage playing all of their greatest and most memorable songs, the deep and often complicated story of Johnny and June unfolds before the audience as a tale told by their son, John Carter Cash. I knew right from the time that the band started and Johnny and June appeared that we were in for a toe-tappin’ time. I wasn’t wrong.\n\nCreated with the support of the Cash family, this new musical covers it all: their childhoods, their epic 1956 meeting at the Grand Ole Opry, the storied on-stage proposal in 1968, the soaring highs and whiplash lows of fame, life on the road, addiction, arrests, controversies, marriage, family and devotion. Reminds me of an episode of one of my soaps, only a real life version. This is a whole-hearted and clear-eyed telling of one of the most iconic love stories in music history, complete with a soundtrack of beloved hits — I Walk the Line, Ring of Fire, Hey Porter, Jackson, I’ve Been Everywhere and many more.\n\nA story as iconic as this one needs the right actors to bring the larger-than-life characters to fruition. The folks at La Jolla Playhouse got this one right. As Johnny Cash, Christopher Ryan Grant, did right by “The Man in Black.” His swagger and deep baritone painted a very effective portrait of Cash. He definitely made you not want to like him but when all was said and done, you couldn’t help but like him. His story reminds me of the saying, “hurt people hurt people.” I could see what June saw in Johnny and the very palpable chemistry of the lead actors made it all the more believable. Patti Murin’s June was a hoot and a spitfire right out of the gate from the very top of the show. Her performance was grounded, playful and full of charisma; a perfect balance to Johnny’s brooding and darkness, especially when he hit his lows.\n\nAs the story’s narrator, John Carter Cash (played by Van Hughes) beautifully illustrates his parent’s 47 years together; from their first meeting on the stage of The Grand Ole Opry through the ending of their love story, leaving this world only four months apart. His character worked well in establishing a storyline of his parents beyond what is known in the press and from the movie released several years ago.\n\nHis guitar picking onstage and song, “The Ballad of Johnny and June,” the only original tune in the piece, fit well and propelled the story. It worked seamlessly how the character weaved in and out of the story as the voice of it but then easily became part of the scenes and blended right in. His scene with June discussing her addiction was heartbreaking, especially seeing the love a son has for his mother.\n\nI can’t forget to acknowledge a very solid ensemble of supporting characters and musicians who bring the story to life. Pamela Leggett Chase has always been a standout in anything I’ve seen her in; it’s nice to see her in her first LJP performance. Also a huge shout out to the entire production staff and crew for creating this special piece of theatre. The book by Robert Cary and Des McAnuff, who also serves as director, complements the musical soundtrack nicely, courtesy of Johnny and June Cash, along with a host of other artists and legends.\n\nIf this show goes to Broadway, which I think it probably will, it definitely needs a little fine tuning. While the whole first act was entertaining, it did run a bit long. I don’t usually get antsy but I found myself getting a little fidgety (and the seats at LJP are comfortable with plenty of legroom, too). But nothing some small revisions and tightening up can’t fix.\n\nThe pacing of Act 2 worked perfectly, so hopefully, the production team can do the same for the first act. If/when it makes its way to Broadway, I’ll be buying tickets. I always enjoy seeing the changes/updates but most importantly, supporting all of the incredible theater right here in San Diego. We are so lucky.\n\nThe only other very small thing that I noticed was June’s hair. I come from the school of big, country queen hair and I felt like June’s wig needed a little more to it. My inner drag queen wanted to get out a rat tail comb and a can of Aqua Net. As Patti Murin is small in stature, I guess they didn’t want her swallowed up by a Dolly Parton sized mound of hair. The higher the hair, the closer to heaven!\n\nThe Ballad of Johnny and June is a must see if you are a lover of the Cash legacy. It continues at La Jolla Playhouse through Sunday, July 7. Tickets are very limited through the rest of the run; however, more are being released daily, so please check their website at lajollaplayhouse.org.\n\nOh Dolly\n\nAnd since I happened to mention Dolly Parton above, have you heard the news that she has written her life story as a Broadway musical!? Called, “Hello, I’m Dolly,” it depicts her life story from her upbringing in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee to her journey of becoming a global icon. It is set to premiere in 2026 in conjunction with Dolly’s 80th birthday. I promise you that I will be in the audience on opening night. Mark my words!\n\nAs I always say, until next time, friends. Be happy. Be kind. Go to the theater. It makes for a great recipe for life.\n\n–Originally from upstate New York, Chris Barone (aka “Miss B”) has been a part of the San Diego/Hillcrest community for 20 years.

      "# [Dolly Parton, governor celebrate Imagination Library mark by Austin Schick on 2024-08-28](https://spectrumnews1.com/ky/louisville/news/2024/08/28/dolly-parton-in-lexington)\nLEXINGTON, Ky. â Grammy Award-winning country music artist Dolly Parton visited Lexington Tuesday to celebrate her Imagination Library in Kentucky.\n\nAll 120 counties in Kentucky recently got access to Partonâs Imagination Library. The country music legend joined Gov. Andy Beshear, D-Ky., and first lady Britainy Beshear to commemorate the occasion.\n\nParton started the Imagination Library in 1995 to honor her father, who could not read or write.\n\nâHe was always real embarrassed about that and that always troubled him because he thought that he couldnât learn to read after he was grown, but daddy was one of the smartest people that you would ever want to know, and he was my hero,â Parton said.\n\nThe no-cost program provides one book a month to children from childbirth to the age of five. Nationwide, over 3 million kids are registered with over 250 million books gifted since its inception.\n\nâItâs really a great way to teach children when theyâre very young to learn to love books and to learn to read,â Parton said.\n\nParton started the program locally in her east Tennessee hometown. Since then, it has grown to 21 states and numerous countries. In Kentucky, over 120,000 children receive free books every month. The program is available from Pikeville to Paducah, with over 6 million books distributed statewide.\n\nâForty-five percent of preschoolers in our state are currently enrolled in the Imagination Library. So that means if you know someone in that 55%, you better get on your phones as soon as we leave here,â said first lady Beshear.\n\nCongressman Morgan McGarvey, D-Louisville, worked to pass the funding for the program during his time in the Kentucky Senate. It was passed in a bipartisan manner.\n\nâBy having every child eligible, thereâs no stigma attached. Kids who are going to kindergarten, not only are they more kindergarten ready, theyâve read some of the same books and they have that common bond,â McGarvey said.\n\nThe statewide program is supported by a 50% state to local program match provided in the state budget, passed by the General Assembly.\n\nThe governor also honored Parton as a Kentucky Colonel and proclaimed the month âImagination Library of Kentucky Month.â\n\nFirst lady Beshear presented Parton with a copy of First Dog Winnieâs new coloring book, âWinnie Goes on a Kentucky State Parks Adventure!â In return, Parton gifted the governor and first lady with a copy of her childrenâs book, âCoat of Many Colors,â named after her hit 1971 song.\n\nMore than 20 years ago, Henderson County established the first Imagination Library program in Kentucky."
