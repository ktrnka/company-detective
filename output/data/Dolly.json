  "summary_markdown": "# About Dolly\n\nDolly is a company founded on January 1, 2014, that specializes in providing on-demand moving and delivery services through mobile applications. The company operates in 45 cities across the United States and has completed millions of moves and deliveries. Dolly's services include apartment moves, furniture delivery, labor-only services, junk haul away, and retail delivery. They have established partnerships with major retailers such as Best Buy, Williams-Sonoma, The Container Store, Crate & Barrel, and Extra Space Storage to enhance their delivery services [(About)](https://dolly.com/about/).\n\nDolly's business model is primarily B2C, serving individual consumers who need moving help. However, they also engage in B2B partnerships with retailers to improve their delivery services. The company generates revenue through service fees charged for each move or delivery, and they offer competitive earnings for their Helpers and Hands, with top performers earning up to $90 per hour [(On-Demand Moving Services, Furniture Delivery & More)](https://dolly.com/services).\n\nThe company is part of the Taskrabbit family, which influences its workplace culture and benefits. Dolly emphasizes innovation and customer service, aiming to improve its services and processes continuously [(Careers at Dolly)](https://dolly.com/hiring).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nThe available information does not specify key personnel at Dolly. However, being part of the Taskrabbit family suggests that leadership may overlap or be influenced by Taskrabbit's executive team. Further research into Taskrabbit's leadership could provide insights into Dolly's management.\n\n# News\n\n## Data Breach Incident\n\nIn November 2023, Dolly experienced a data breach where hackers leaked data despite receiving a ransom. This incident highlights potential vulnerabilities in Dolly's data security measures and could impact customer trust [(Joseph Henry, TechTimes, 2023-11-14)](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/298657/20231114/dolly-com-hackers-leak-data-despite-receiving-ransom.htm).\n\n## Funding and Financial News\n\nDolly has raised a total of $17 million in funding over several rounds, with the most recent being $7 million on May 2, 2019. This funding supports their expansion and service enhancement efforts [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dolly).\n\n## Other News\n\nThe news section also includes unrelated articles about individuals and entities named Dolly, such as Dolly Parton and Dolly Khanna. These articles do not pertain to the Dolly moving and delivery service company.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nDolly is a significant player in the on-demand moving and delivery service industry, with a strong presence in 45 U.S. cities and partnerships with major retailers. The company focuses on customer satisfaction and competitive earnings for its service providers. However, recent security challenges, such as the data breach, may require attention to maintain customer trust. Dolly's integration with Taskrabbit suggests a supportive corporate environment that could facilitate further growth and innovation.",

Please read all the terms before you directly (or indirectly) access or use (or have a third-party access or use) any component of the Dolly Platform on your behalf or for your benefit. If a term does not make sense to you, please let us know. If you don't agree to these Terms, you may not access or use (or ask a third party to access or use) the Dolly Platform on your behalf or for your benefit.\n\nModifications\n\nYou represent and warrant that you will review these Terms prior to making a Request and that any continued access or use of the Dolly Platform is subject to the then current Terms posted at the time of your access or use.\n\nWe reserve the right to change these Terms from time to time. The Terms applicable to you are the Terms in place when you access or use the Dolly Platform. If we make changes to the Terms, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of these Terms and, in some cases, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification).\n\nWe encourage you to review the Terms regularly, and prior to initiating any new Request on the Dolly Platform so that you are aware of the most current Terms which will apply at the time of your access or usage.

If we do not reach settlement within a period of 60 days, then either of us may, by notice to the other demand mediation under the mediation rules of the American Arbitration Association in Seattle, Washington. We both give up our right to litigate our disputes and may not proceed to arbitration without first trying mediation, but you and Dolly are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief from the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Dolly will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.\n\nIf settlement is not reached within 60 days after service of a written demand for mediation, any unresolved controversy or claim will be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association before a single arbitrator in Seattle, Washington. The language of all proceedings and filings will be English. The arbitrator will render a written opinion including findings of fact and law and the award and/or determination of the arbitrator will be binding on the parties, and their respective administrators and assigns, and will not be subject to appeal. Judgment may be entered upon the award of the arbitrator in any court of competent jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration will be shared equally by the parties unless the arbitration determines that the expenses will be otherwise assessed and the prevailing party may be awarded its attorneys' fees and expenses by the arbitrator. It is the intent of the parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances, arbitration proceedings will be concluded within 90 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit only if failure to do so would unduly prejudice the rights of the parties. Failure to adhere to this time limit will not constitute a basis for challenging the award. Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, pre-hearing information exchange will be limited to the reasonable production of relevant, non-privileged documents, carried out expeditiously.\n\nFor any disputes between the Parties that are not handled by arbitration, you agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms and/or the subject matter covered by these Terms shall be filed only in the state and federal courts located in Seattle, Washington and the Parties each hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding between the Parties arising out of or relating these Terms and/or the subject matter covered by these Terms.\n\nGeneral\n\nEnforcement of these Terms is solely at Dolly's discretion. Failure to enforce any part of these Terms in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce the same or other part of these Terms in other instances.\n\nIf any provision of these Terms is or becomes unlawful, void or otherwise unenforceable (including the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations above), then that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.\n\nThe section headings of these Terms are for reference purposes only and will not affect the meaning or interpretation of these Terms.\n\nThese Terms (and terms or policies incorporated herein) make up the entire agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter covered herein, including access and use of Dolly Platform, Requests, and the Services, and they supersede any other terms, whether implied or expressed.\n\nContact Us\n\nIf you have any questions about these Terms, please email us at [email protected] or send a letter to:\n\nDolly, Inc.\n\n9450 SW Gemini Dr., PMB 43895\n\nBeaverton, Oregon 97008-7105\n\nNotice for California Users\n\nIf you are a California resident, you may have these Terms mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to the address above with your electronic mail address and a request for these Terms. Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California Website users are entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 1625 N. Market Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.\n\nNotice Regarding Apple\n\nApple, Inc. and Other Third-Party Beneficiaries. You acknowledge and agree that Apple, Inc. (\"Apple\") and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and further that (a) upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party; (b) these Terms are conducted between you and Dolly only, and not Apple; (c) Dolly, and not Apple, is solely responsible for the Dolly Platform and the content thereof provided by Dolly; (d) Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Dolly Platform; (e) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no warranty obligation with respect to the Dolly Platform; and Dolly, and not Apple, will be responsible for any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure of the Dolly Platform to conform to any applicable warranty; (f) in the event of any third party claim that the Dolly Platform or your possession and use of that Dolly Platform infringes that third party's intellectual property rights, Apple will not be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim; and (g) Apple will not be responsible for addressing any of your claims or any third party claims relating to the Dolly Platform or your possession and/or use of the Dolly Platform, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Dolly Platform fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.\n\nNotice Regarding Damage Protection\n\nPlease note that Damage Protection only applies to the goods being transported. It does not protect damage to the environment surrounding the Dolly (e.g. floors, walls, ceiling, etc.). Additionally, for Damage Protection and insurance purposes, the value of any given item is considered to be the lesser of (a) the price at which it was most recently purchased (last 12 months), or (b) the cost of replacement, as may be reasonably determined by Dolly. Further, the value of such an item is determined independently of the amount of any supplemental Damage Protection purchased from Dolly (in addition to the $300 of complimentary Damage Protection provided by Dolly). For example, if $1,000 of supplemental Damage Protection were purchased, the recent purchase price was $300, and the cost of replacement were $400, then Damage Protection would cover $300. Dolly reserves the right to reject any claims of damage not submitted within 14 days of the damaging incident. Dolly is not responsible for any damage that is incurred outside of the express-written parameters of the move as purchased by the customer. Any act undertaken by our independent contractors that is not explicitly paid for may not qualify for Damage Protection.",

There, you can view, update, and correct your Account information.\n\nSo that we may protect the integrity of the Taskrabbit Platform, there are certain pieces of information, such as your age, that you cannot alter yourself.

Taskrabbit's Information Retention Policy\n\nWe retain personal data for as long as you are a User in order to meet our contractual obligations to you, and for such longer period as may be in our legitimate interests and to comply with our legal obligations (see Exhibit A for exemplar document retention periods). We may also retain data from which you cannot directly be identified, for example where stored against a randomly-generated identifier so we know the data relates to a single User, but we cannot tell who that User is. We use this kind of data for research purposes and to help us develop and improve our services, and we take appropriate measures to ensure you cannot be re-identified from this data.\n\n9. Taskrabbit’s Security of Collected Information\n\nYour Taskrabbit account is password-protected so that only you and authorized Taskrabbit staff have access to your account information. In order to maintain this protection, do not give your password to anyone. Also, if you share a computer, you should sign out of your Taskrabbit account and close the browser window before someone else logs on. This will help protect your information entered on public terminals from disclosure to third parties.\n\nTaskrabbit implements and maintains reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security safeguards to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

We asked a customer how much tip he gave and he said $40 but Dolly gave us $36 and they do this every time. Not a good app they just care about making all the money for themselves. The reason a lot of people use Dolly is because their cheap and the reason their cheap is because they don’t look out for their drivers and pay them next to nothing.

Also BEWARE THE TEAMS SCAM. When you have someone (like a spouse) who can work with you, they’ll tell you to setup as a team rather than an individual helper and hands. When you do this, you get paid LESS than when you register separately. This is a ploy to make more money for the company. Those savings are not passed on to the customer. \n\nBeyond this, job descriptions and sizes are often inaccurate. Support claims quick response times but average 3-24hrs. Sometimes they don’t respond at all. Decent money can be made but you’ll have to deal with the frustrations. Also, dolly posts pay rates low and only increases to what they are able to pay if no one takes the job. They make massive profits by lowballing us contractors.",

One was a delivery route for The Container Store with 5 different deliveries all over L.A. it said there would be a tip for each delivery, but the tip was $0 for the whole route. It took 3.5 hours (locations were far apart) and paid $55. Used at least $20 in gas. One of the deliveries was to an $11 million dollar house in Beverly Hills. I don’t know if Dolly is pocketing the tips, or if there were really 0 out of 5 people that tipped. Either way it is less than minimum wage and not worth it. The 2nd Dolly I did was to move a dresser for $37. The dresser was very heavy and the location we delivered it to had a staircase that looked like it was designed by someone trying to make a staircase that was impossible to carry furniture up. It was the worst. After we finished, The client said they have had several delivery people just leave things at the bottom of the stairs and refuse to even try. Both of these jobs I knew would only be worth it when including a tip. Not one of them tipped. That 2nd client saw us laboring and dripping sweat and struggling to carry a heavy piece of furniture up the worst set of stairs. I have lost a little bit of my faith in humanity, my whole body hurts, and I’m never working Dolly again. You can make more money with Instacart or Uber Eats or anything but this. It’s not worth it. They need to pay more, or make the client tip beforehand like Postmates does. Then we can consider if we want to do the job. When you give people an option to tip after the service is provided, we apparently get screwed 6 out of 6 times. We aren’t waiters who should be tipped after providing good service with a smile.

Not very helpful when in a pinch. \n\nThey used to pay well, now the wages are a joke for the drive time/work time combination (at least here in CA).

      "# Less than minimum wage, 1 stars [(Mneurp, Apple App Store, 2022-12-23)](https://apple/9427250451)\nJust finished my first 2 Dollys. One was a delivery route for The Container Store with 5 different deliveries all over L.A. it said there would be a tip for each delivery, but the tip was $0 for the whole route. It took 3.5 hours (locations were far apart) and paid $55. Used at least $20 in gas. One of the deliveries was to an $11 million dollar house in Beverly Hills. I don’t know if Dolly is pocketing the tips, or if there were really 0 out of 5 people that tipped. Either way it is less than minimum wage and not worth it. The 2nd Dolly I did was to move a dresser for $37. The dresser was very heavy and the location we delivered it to had a staircase that looked like it was designed by someone trying to make a staircase that was impossible to carry furniture up. It was the worst. After we finished, The client said they have had several delivery people just leave things at the bottom of the stairs and refuse to even try. Both of these jobs I knew would only be worth it when including a tip. Not one of them tipped. That 2nd client saw us laboring and dripping sweat and struggling to carry a heavy piece of furniture up the worst set of stairs. I have lost a little bit of my faith in humanity, my whole body hurts, and I’m never working Dolly again. You can make more money with Instacart or Uber Eats or anything but this. It’s not worth it. They need to pay more, or make the client tip beforehand like Postmates does. Then we can consider if we want to do the job. When you give people an option to tip after the service is provided, we apparently get screwed 6 out of 6 times. We aren’t waiters who should be tipped after providing good service with a smile. We are moving heavy things into small places and should know how much we are going to make beforehand. The tip should be made beforehand, and we can consider it when deciding whether or not to take the job.",

Because they pay very low, once I needed a helper for one hour and try to hire one from Dolly. Usually they pay $30/hr, but at the end were asking me to pay more than $80/hr for one person.

How someone will say that it’s easy to work with. Even if you bid for a job, most likely you won’t get it because they decide who will.

Has anyone used this for a full move?\n\nSome background: I live in a 4th floor walkup apt, but I’m moving to the 2nd floor of an elevator building. I have heavy furniture (storage bed, 8 drawer dresser with mirror, etc) and they’ll definitely have to dissemble some things and make multiple trips.\n\n## Comment ID emf9hmq with +17 score by [(Travelswithcat, Reddit, 2019-05-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/bkagrh/is_dolly_a_good_app_for_moving_an_entire_bedroom/emf9hmq/) (in reply to ID bkagrh):\nDolly has been great for me every time I've used it. Just be accurate with your estimations and tip at the end. All the movers I've had were super helpful and hard working. Can you dissemble the furniture yourself? I'm not sure they do that, but it's been a bit since I've used the app.\n\n### Comment ID emfci0f with +6 score by [(llamaspit93, Reddit, 2019-05-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/bkagrh/is_dolly_a_good_app_for_moving_an_entire_bedroom/emfci0f/) (in reply to ID emf9hmq):\nGreat!

They pay the contractors bottom rate prices and the service level shows.\n\nI hope this company goes under.",

My thinking is I could pull straight in, disconnect, and then use the dolly to swing the boat 180 for the next time I’m ready to take it back out.

One thing to keep in mind with a moving truck, it will not have much power, they don't care.  So on any kind of grade, especially towing your car, you WILL get passed on the uphill.  I have moved quite a few times in the last 8 years (LA to Detroit was 2200 miles, and Detroit to Portland, OR 2500 miles among others).  \n\nOne thing I'd say, and this comes down to YOUR comfort level, how do you feel about a 2 lane road compared to interstate?  \n\nThe bottom route diverts on to US 54, SW into Tucumcari, NM.  It's a well maintained road, but it is for most of the duration a 2 lane national highway.  You will be going through small to moderate towns and this will slow you down.  If you stay on I 35 South to Oklahoma City, then take I 40 west you will essentially be on the same route, but on the smoother, simpler interstate system.  The fun part of this is that theoretically, due to the higher speed limits, it's about the same time, at least for a car.  Depending on which company you've chosen, you may have a speed limiter in the truck.  I always chose Penske, and they limit to 70 MPH, so going on I 40 isn't faster, because the limit on that road is 75 MPH, but the limit on most of US 54 is 65 MPH.  \n\nI moved from Twin Cities to Phoenix in 2016, so I understand the fun you're going through, moving has it's challenges, but it's fun.  I'd also recommend you pre-plan and book your hotels in advance.  It gives you good points to make sure you stay on your schedule.\n\n## Comment ID lpfth54 with +1 score by [(timesuck47, Reddit, 2024-09-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/roadtrip/comments/1frh50p/easiest_drive_from_msp_to_la_with_moving_truck/lpfth54/) (in reply to ID 1frh50p):\nNOT through Colorado.\n\n## Comment ID lpg62m7 with +1 score by [(GearhedMG, Reddit, 2024-09-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/roadtrip/comments/1frh50p/easiest_drive_from_msp_to_la_with_moving_truck/lpg62m7/) (in reply to ID 1frh50p):\nAs a fellow Minnesotan that is now in the LA Metro Area, I would like to say welcome!

I have done a cross country trip with both (not with Rav4).  I found the car carrier a bit more cumbersome to maneuver in parking lots but otherwise it was not difficult.  I was a 20-something female at the time (still a female).  You will need a friend to get the car up on the carrier (to help direct you).\n\nIf it is manual transmission you may be able to tow it with just the front wheels off the ground but I am not sure.

Both houses have wood flooring.\n\nWe'll probably use a pickup truck to transport it.  A lift gate truck would be nice, but probably not attainable.\n\nWhat do I need to easily move the fridge ?\n\n\\- furniture sliders ?\n\n\\- appliance dolly ?\n\n\\- ratchet straps ?\n\n\\- moving blankets ?\n\n\\- ramps to get in the back of the pickup truck ?\n\n**Update**\n\nThe fridge has been moved. \n\nI hired a guy with a pickup truck.  My buddy brought his furniture dolly.\n\nWe strapped the fridge to the furniture dolly and wheeled it out to the truck.   We put the back of the dolly against the endgate.  Two guys on the bottom of the fridge, one guy in the bed of the truck pulling up.   It went up easily.  As soon as the fridge leans back, the tailgate is holding half the weight of the fridge. \n\nWe rolled the dolly was against the front of the box.  We strapped the dolly to the front of the box and also to the back of the box with ratchet straps. It was very secure.\n\nUnloading was reverse of loading.  Lean the fridge back and wheel it to the edge of the tailgate.  Then slowly edge it over while 2 guys help from the ground.   It helps to have a dolly that has skids or tracks just above the wheels that are level with the back of the wheels, like this one.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0ojuGCkmNg\n\nI had to remove the doors and drawer fronts to get it through the door in my house.

Shoulder lifting straps with a second person will make getting it to a pickup truck cake.  Remove anything from inside you can to make it lighter and less destructive.

The bad experiences kept piling up and NOTHING was done to make it right despite reaching out to the customer concern team numerous times, trying to give them a chance. \n\nThe support is absolutely garbage. They don’t even have a number to reach if there is an immediate emergency (which more often than not, issues arise). You can leave a voicemail over phone then wait about 3 days for a response or send an email and again, wait some time to hear back. Not very helpful when in a pinch. \n\nThey used to pay well, now the wages are a joke for the drive time/work time combination (at least here in CA). Is $20 worth driving 25 miles each way to load and unload a couch worth it? With gas near 5 dollars a gallon, not so much. Sad part is they can afford to give their workers quite a bit more or actually pay for a support team!!\n\nWhat really irks me is that this company literally only has to pay the help (us) and their little bit of staff,  meaning they have very little overhead. Although, like all other companies in today’s world, they are greedy and could give a **** about the people actually doing the work.

          "content": "Just finished my first 2 Dollys. One was a delivery route for The Container Store with 5 different deliveries all over L.A. it said there would be a tip for each delivery, but the tip was $0 for the whole route. It took 3.5 hours (locations were far apart) and paid $55. Used at least $20 in gas. One of the deliveries was to an $11 million dollar house in Beverly Hills. I don’t know if Dolly is pocketing the tips, or if there were really 0 out of 5 people that tipped. Either way it is less than minimum wage and not worth it. The 2nd Dolly I did was to move a dresser for $37. The dresser was very heavy and the location we delivered it to had a staircase that looked like it was designed by someone trying to make a staircase that was impossible to carry furniture up. It was the worst. After we finished, The client said they have had several delivery people just leave things at the bottom of the stairs and refuse to even try. Both of these jobs I knew would only be worth it when including a tip. Not one of them tipped. That 2nd client saw us laboring and dripping sweat and struggling to carry a heavy piece of furniture up the worst set of stairs. I have lost a little bit of my faith in humanity, my whole body hurts, and I’m never working Dolly again. You can make more money with Instacart or Uber Eats or anything but this. It’s not worth it. They need to pay more, or make the client tip beforehand like Postmates does. Then we can consider if we want to do the job. When you give people an option to tip after the service is provided, we apparently get screwed 6 out of 6 times. We aren’t waiters who should be tipped after providing good service with a smile. We are moving heavy things into small places and should know how much we are going to make beforehand. The tip should be made beforehand, and we can consider it when deciding whether or not to take the job.",

In my early stages with this company, I was actually making $500-$700 a week (as a hand). 2-3 years later, I got a truck and became a helper. Becoming a helper means more money a week. Normally, doubling whatever a hands would make a week. In my case, suppose to be $1000-$1,400 a week! Once I became a helper, it was hard getting accepted for jobs. They pay started to slowly drop overtime. Then, out of nowhere, Dolly just became cheap. This caused me to cancel or not show up to certain jobs. Really have to think long and hard about doing the job before/ after accepting it. I truly don’t know what happened to Dolly. I was one of the first people to sign up and work with Dolly. It was like a gold mine in its early stages. Now, they’re slowly putting themselves out of business!",

Because they pay very low, once I needed a helper for one hour and try to hire one from Dolly. Usually they pay $30/hr, but at the end were asking me to pay more than $80/hr for one person. Do the calculations and think if it’s worth it even to open an account with them. I paid $25 fee, lost hours to complete the account and at the end, all it’s wasted. How someone will say that it’s easy to work with. Even if you bid for a job, most likely you won’t get it because they decide who will.

The overall attitude towards Operations &amp; Support (customer success), from a company-wide level, needs to change. One of your founders regularly bad mouths them as second class employees. \r\n\r\nIf you start respecting your people they will go to war for you. Compensate them properly so they don't have to stay at home to work, because they literally cant afford bus fare. On that note, probably best with a downtown office to provide some sort of commuter pass help, which almost every single company downtown provides. \r\n\r\nIt is possible to improve, but Leadership and management would all need to take a hard look in the mirror and see that they are the cause of many issues. Realize that people who get treated well by companies as employees, work harder and stick around. When employees for the Operations department are regularly surfacing that they feel grossly under compensated, LISTEN. The reasoning that \"its within low market average\" doesn't cut it if there is a complete department turnover in 6 months. \r\n\r\nIf you were compensating properly, respecting your employees, and honoring  work/life balance, would everyone be leaving at such a high rate? (100% of Support/Customer Success Agents left from 6 months ago) \r\n\r\nDolly is an amazing idea but my experience with management soured me so much, it is hard for me to root for them as a company.",

This is a very hard pill to swallow when you work more than 50+ hours per week, and then find out that many other departments employees are making 2X your salary, and not even working 40 hours a week. \r\n\r\nDon't plan on holidays and weekends being off limits for a Manager non-stop texting you about work, or to get on your laptop because that Manager cannot properly hire, staff-out, train, nor retain Support Agents for their team. There was more than one occurrence where I had to repeatedly ask this manager to stop texting me about work, because I was with my family on Thanksgiving. This was a regular occurrence during weekends.  I have worked for a number of startups in various stages, the team at Dolly will tell you this is normal....it is not. \r\n\r\nIf you do get promoted up the very short ladder available, more and more will be asked of you, which is great until you realize that you're doing multiple jobs responsibilities and not getting anywhere near compensated for your time and work. \r\n\r\nUnlimited PTO is completely false for the Operations team. In my experience, I was flat out denied a vacation which was for a friends wedding. I was also made to come in on a day requested off. These kind of things do not happen at companies that value people and their lives outside of work.",

          "cons": "Despite selling the vision of upper mobility, increased staffing/funding, the truth becomes apparent quite quickly. If you're hired at an hourly role for the support roles, you start at less than minimum wage (because they are a startup they don't need to match this yet), and are told that eventually you may be able to transition into a salaried position with full benefits. This won't be the case until you serve at least 2 years and meet every requirement. Given the current track record, you'll either quit or get let go before you get there. \r\n\r\nBe prepared to work anytime between 5AM and 9PM, any day of the week including (and especially) Saturdays/Sundays. An email/text from management at odd hours expecting a response on days off is not uncommon.\r\n\r\nIn the Ops team, the expectations to work harder and smarter than anyone else, while being underpaid and also being responsible for any shortcomings will take a toll on your mental health. \r\n\r\nThe Customer \"Success\" team is expected to be working non-stop by urgently handling every request that comes in the help desk via phone calls, emails, text messages,  etc. Being on the phone for 4+ hours a day is not uncommon, most of which is spent dealing with highly stressful situations and unpleasant customers and contractors that work for the company.\r\n\r\nManagement is not shy of publicly shaming any shortcomings, but is conservative when providing any praise or incentives to keep up the work. \r\n\r\nParking for the building is $200/mo, and there is no program to reimburse you for your transit costs. Even if you're working on an hourly rate of $14 in one of the most expensive cities in the country. The cost of getting to and from work will essentially mean you work at least 15 hours to cover your bus fares for the month.\r\n\r\nFor a being a technology company that started off with a mobile app, it's incredibly frustrating to see that the app is still plagued with issues. Customers and contractors that work for the company in the field will report and complain about app problems every day but with the entire app team consisting of 1 or 2 developers( without a product manager), it is crippling the progress of the company. The unfortunate truth is that these developers are spending the vast majority of their time troubleshooting and bug fixing rather than releasing new features.\r\n\r\nBusiness development forges new partnerships with stores in markets all the time, but does not take into account how the customers that shop at these stores fit the persona for the company. Having to make \"one-time exceptions\" all the time, and ultimately have to provide a negative experience due to customer expectations is not worth it. \r\n\r\nBottom line, there are false promises being made all around. The company has an excellent product idea, and solves a real problem. However, the entire focus is around the customers (who have zero brand loyalty) rather than the employees and the contractors that are actually providing the service. \r\n\r\nA bad apple here or there is excusable. But when there have been over 10 employees that have either quit or been let go for the same management reasons, it serves to show there is a common denominator that poor leadership is causing the company to suffer and prevent healthy growth.",

        "cons": "Despite selling the vision of upper mobility, increased staffing/funding, the truth becomes apparent quite quickly. If you're hired at an hourly role for the support roles, you start at less than minimum wage (because they are a startup they don't need to match this yet), and are told that eventually you may be able to transition into a salaried position with full benefits. This won't be the case until you serve at least 2 years and meet every requirement. Given the current track record, you'll either quit or get let go before you get there. \r\n\r\nBe prepared to work anytime between 5AM and 9PM, any day of the week including (and especially) Saturdays/Sundays. An email/text from management at odd hours expecting a response on days off is not uncommon.\r\n\r\nIn the Ops team, the expectations to work harder and smarter than anyone else, while being underpaid and also being responsible for any shortcomings will take a toll on your mental health. \r\n\r\nThe Customer \"Success\" team is expected to be working non-stop by urgently handling every request that comes in the help desk via phone calls, emails, text messages,  etc. Being on the phone for 4+ hours a day is not uncommon, most of which is spent dealing with highly stressful situations and unpleasant customers and contractors that work for the company.\r\n\r\nManagement is not shy of publicly shaming any shortcomings, but is conservative when providing any praise or incentives to keep up the work. \r\n\r\nParking for the building is $200/mo, and there is no program to reimburse you for your transit costs. Even if you're working on an hourly rate of $14 in one of the most expensive cities in the country. The cost of getting to and from work will essentially mean you work at least 15 hours to cover your bus fares for the month.\r\n\r\nFor a being a technology company that started off with a mobile app, it's incredibly frustrating to see that the app is still plagued with issues. Customers and contractors that work for the company in the field will report and complain about app problems every day but with the entire app team consisting of 1 or 2 developers( without a product manager), it is crippling the progress of the company. The unfortunate truth is that these developers are spending the vast majority of their time troubleshooting and bug fixing rather than releasing new features.\r\n\r\nBusiness development forges new partnerships with stores in markets all the time, but does not take into account how the customers that shop at these stores fit the persona for the company. Having to make \"one-time exceptions\" all the time, and ultimately have to provide a negative experience due to customer expectations is not worth it. \r\n\r\nBottom line, there are false promises being made all around. The company has an excellent product idea, and solves a real problem. However, the entire focus is around the customers (who have zero brand loyalty) rather than the employees and the contractors that are actually providing the service. \r\n\r\nA bad apple here or there is excusable. But when there have been over 10 employees that have either quit or been let go for the same management reasons, it serves to show there is a common denominator that poor leadership is causing the company to suffer and prevent healthy growth.",

        "advice": "Management and Leadership have some serious challenges ahead if they plan on making Dolly the product, as well as Dolly the company, successful. The overall attitude towards Operations &amp; Support (customer success), from a company-wide level, needs to change. One of your founders regularly bad mouths them as second class employees. \r\n\r\nIf you start respecting your people they will go to war for you. Compensate them properly so they don't have to stay at home to work, because they literally cant afford bus fare. On that note, probably best with a downtown office to provide some sort of commuter pass help, which almost every single company downtown provides. \r\n\r\nIt is possible to improve, but Leadership and management would all need to take a hard look in the mirror and see that they are the cause of many issues. Realize that people who get treated well by companies as employees, work harder and stick around. When employees for the Operations department are regularly surfacing that they feel grossly under compensated, LISTEN. The reasoning that \"its within low market average\" doesn't cut it if there is a complete department turnover in 6 months. \r\n\r\nIf you were compensating properly, respecting your employees, and honoring  work/life balance, would everyone be leaving at such a high rate? (100% of Support/Customer Success Agents left from 6 months ago) \r\n\r\nDolly is an amazing idea but my experience with management soured me so much, it is hard for me to root for them as a company.",
        "cons": "Compensation for all Operations positions are grossly under market value. Feedback from Management is that there is no more money in the budget for raises. This is a very hard pill to swallow when you work more than 50+ hours per week, and then find out that many other departments employees are making 2X your salary, and not even working 40 hours a week. \r\n\r\nDon't plan on holidays and weekends being off limits for a Manager non-stop texting you about work, or to get on your laptop because that Manager cannot properly hire, staff-out, train, nor retain Support Agents for their team. There was more than one occurrence where I had to repeatedly ask this manager to stop texting me about work, because I was with my family on Thanksgiving. This was a regular occurrence during weekends.  I have worked for a number of startups in various stages, the team at Dolly will tell you this is normal....it is not. \r\n\r\nIf you do get promoted up the very short ladder available, more and more will be asked of you, which is great until you realize that you're doing multiple jobs responsibilities and not getting anywhere near compensated for your time and work. \r\n\r\nUnlimited PTO is completely false for the Operations team. In my experience, I was flat out denied a vacation which was for a friends wedding. I was also made to come in on a day requested off.

Everyone cares about not just your work performance, but your personal happiness, and will go out of their way to make sure you're happy in all aspects of your life. One of the leaders even did a full presentation on investing for anyone who was interested because me and another employee didn't fully understand some of the terminology around our stock.\r\n- Lots of opportunities to influence &amp; change the company, and higher-ups are always happy to listen to new ideas\r\n- Diverse team that's always working to become more diverse when hiring\r\n- Weekly standups covering KPIs across all teams, so you know what people are working on and you always know how the company is progressing\r\n- Other teams are always open to your input and suggestions, and no idea is too far-fetched to be heard out\r\n- Opportunities to work on high-level projects no matter your level.

(Click here to see all the red carpet fashion.)\n\nThe 37-year-old, who sparkled in a short silver dress, pointed out that Dolly has always felt like family and that was only confirmed after learning her half-sister Miley is seventh cousins with Dolly—a connection that even the \"Jolene\" singer was thrilled by.\n\n\"She's Miley's godmother,\" Brandi exclusively told E! News cohost Keltie Knight on the red carpet, \"so I always say she's mine by association.\"\n\nThe musical families share a mutual great-grandfather named John Brickley, who lived in Blunt County, Tenn., in the early 1800s. And since they're now related, Brandi is already thinking about how she and her newfound cousin can work together.\n\n\"There should be a Brandi and Dolly collab,\" the DJ mused, \"maybe next year. That sounds right to me.\"\n\nAs for which iconic Dolly song she would love to remix? While she knows that \"Jolene\" would be a great choice, especially because \"Miley loves that song and she freakin' kills it,\" Brandi would prefer to do something that hadn't already been done so many times.\n\n\"I feel like we could do a sick '9 to 5' remix,\" she said, explaining that the key to a good remix is picking a song \"that people love and know, and that people are gonna sing along and dance to.\"\n\nSo Brandi is going to put that out into the universe, which is what she told E! she's been doing the past year, adding that she's been \"working hard and the payoff has been great.\"\n\n\"It's been a crazy year for me,\" she confessed. \"I kinda manifested this Wynn residency in Las Vegas. It's been my goal for a few years now that I've been doing this. I want the Vegas residency, I wanna be at the Wynn. So I've been doing that all year. It's been incredible.\"\n\nBrandi also had her debut release with a remix of Lainey Wilson's \"Wildflowers and Wild Horses,\" which she noted was \"another dream come true.\"\n\nBut more than that, Brandi shared that she's finally feeling like herself and comfortable in what she's doing as a DJ, joking that while people are surprised to learn about her new vocation, they realize how much it was meant for her when they see her in action.\n\nShe added, \"It feels like me.\"\n\nTo see more from the 2024 People's Choice Country Awards red carpet, keep reading.\n\n(E!, NBC and Peacock are all part of the NBCUniversal family.)",

They're actually related.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ancestry.com revealed that they're seventh cousins, once removed. According to the genealogy company, they share a mutual relative in John Brickey, who was born in Virginia in 1740 and lived in Blount County, Tennessee, until his death in 1806.\n\nThe news didn't come as too much of a shock to Dolly, who was presented with and asked about the information during an interview with Access Hollywood published on Monday. Dolly and her sister Rachel Parton George were speaking to the news outlet while promoting their new cookbook, Good Lookin' Cookin'.\n\n\"Now, who thought that up? Is that true?\" Dolly said as the reporter then revealed the shared ancestor. \"That's amazing,\" she continued. \"We're so close, Miley and I. I would've thought we'd at least been third cousins, 10 times removed.\"\n\nWhen asked about her thoughts on the relation, Dolly said, \"That's amazing, the ancestry that says I'm related to Miley, and I'm sure she'll get a kick out of that.

The genealogy company has discovered that the two are actually seventh cousins, once removed.\n\nBy using billions of historical records and its public family trees, Ancestry uncovered that Parton and Cyrus are related through a shared ancestor.\n\nTheir mutual great-grandfather, John Brickey, was born in Virginia in 1740 and moved to Blount County, Tenn. — only about 20 miles from Dollywood — where he stayed until his death in 1806. Brickey is Parton's sixth great- grandfather and Cyrus' seventh.\n\nParton learned that she was related to Cyrus in an interview with Access Hollywood. “Is that true? That’s amazing!\" Parton said.\n\n\"Well we're so close, Miley and I, I would've thought we'd been at least, you know, third cousins ... ten times removed! I’m sure [Miley] will get a kick out of that…it doesn’t surprise me because she does feel like family.”\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe two singers have always had a deep connection. Parton has known Cyrus since before she was born, she said in a 2023 interview on SiriusXM’s “The Howard Stern Show.”\n\nParton became close with Cyrus' father, Billy Ray Cyrus, after touring together.\n\n“We just got to be good friends because he’s a Kentucky boy, I’m from Tennessee,” Parton said on the show. “And he said … ‘We’re having a girl, and you’ve got to be her godmother!’ And I said, ‘Well, I’d be honored.’ So actually, Miley and I took over from there. We just stayed very, very close through the years.”\n\n“Dolly’s been like a mother to me,\" Cyrus told W Magazine in June.\n\nParton has been a maternal figure to Cyrus, both on and off the screen. She played Aunt Dolly on \"Hannah Montana,\" first appearing on the show in 2006.\n\nThe two have also hit the stage together. Cyrus and Parton performed at a New Year's Eve party together last year, ringing in 2023 with a viral performance.\n\nThe news comes at an appropriate time, as Parton is gearing up to honor her family's roots with the release of her Nov. 15 album, \"Dolly Parton & Family: Smoky Mountain DNA – Family, Faith & Fables.\"\n\nThe album, a collaboration between Dollywood and Parton's co-owned Owepar Entertainment, will pay homage to Parton's family lineage, all the way from the U.K. to East Tennessee.\n\nA four-part docuseries, which will accompany the album, is also in production.\n\nMore:Dolly Parton spotlights her and her family's 'Smoky Mountain DNA' with new album, documentary\n\nAudrey Gibbs is a music journalist for The Tennessean.

As it turns out, they share a \"common ancestor from Tennessee\" named John Brickey, who was Parton’s 6th great-grandfather and Cyrus’ 7th great-grandfather.\n\nBorn in 1740 in Virginia, Brickey later relocated to Tennessee with his wife and children and stayed there until he died in 1806.\n\n“The Brickey family originated from France and the progenitor of the family came to the United States in the late 1600s,” the report reads.\n\nAncestry made the discovery by using the \"billions of historical records and public family trees\" in its records.\n\nIn an interview with Access Hollywood, Parton reacted to the revelation.\n\n\"Is that true? That's amazing,\" she said. \"We're so close, Miley and I. You would've though we would've been at least third cousins. I'm sure she'll get a kick out of that. It doesn't surprise me because she does feel like family.\"\n\nTODAY.com has reached out to Cyrus for comment.\n\nOver the years, Parton and Cyrus have spoken at length about their special relationship. In 2023, Cyrus told W Magazine that Parton has \"been like a mother\" to her and described a fax message the country icon sent her a few years ago on Mother's Day.\n\n“Dolly wrote to me to say: ‘How much do I love you? As much as my heart can hold and as far as my arms can reach,’” Cyrus said. “It gets me choked up. I just love her so much.”\n\nIn a tribute to Parton after she was named to Time magazine's 100 most influential people of 2021, Cyrus described Parton as her \"idol because of her incomparable career\" and her \"role model because of her steadfast morals and values.”\n\nWhen Cyrus was starring on \"Hannah Montana,\" her godmother made a few guest appearances on the show and played her aunt.\n\n“I remember when she came in to do a table read for Hannah Montana in all her bedazzled glory,” Cyrus wrote in an essay for Time. “Her smell, the way her nails tapped the table, the sound it made when she flipped the pages of the script—I could see that she fascinated other people too. A living fantasy was in front of all of us.”\n\nThe singers also teamed up for a TV special called “Miley’s New Year’s Eve Party” in 2022. At the time, Cyrus spoke to TODAY about their bond.\n\n“People are going to be affected by the show. There’s a chemistry, and a realness, and a love, and a connection that her and I have that I really feel,” she said.",

These are my people.\"\n\nParton grew up in nearby Sevierville, Tennessee, home of her Dollywood theme park.\n\nRELATED: New NOAA maps show street-by-street views of Hurricane Helene's destruction\n\nParton said she’s personally donating $1 million to the Mountain Ways Foundation, a nonprofit working to help Helene victims recover from devastating flood damage in eastern Tennessee, western North Carolina and the greater Appalachia region.\n\nRELATED: Grandparents found hugging each other after fallen tree killed them during Hurricane Helene\n\nHer other businesses, including Dollywood Parks & Resorts, Dolly Parton’s Stampede and Pirates Voyage Dinner & Show, are also donating $1 million, bringing the total donation to $2 million.\n\nParton also took the time to sing for the crowd, adapting her hit song \"Jolene\" to \"Helene\" and changing the lyrics to, \"You came in here and broke us all apart.\"\n\nRELATED: Asheville shelter saves 100 pets from Helene's floods but more help is needed\n\nThe death toll soared to 215 people on Thursday as more victims were found, making Helene the deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina in 2005. Roughly half the victims were in North Carolina, while dozens more were killed in South Carolina and Georgia. How many people are missing or unaccounted for isn’t clear.\n\n\"It’s personal because I have a lot of my own relatives that live here, and when we heard about this it was devastating, not just because it was my family, because all these people feel like my people,\" Parton said. \"We all feel related, and we are in some sort of way … you don’t want to see anybody suffering. I was heartbroken like everybody else, just amazed and devastated.\"\n\nRELATED: Dolly Parton is sending free books to children across 21 states — and worldwide\n\nNow a week since the storm first roared onto Florida’s Gulf Coast, the search has continued for people who have yet to be heard from in places where phone service and electricity were knocked out. Pleas for help are coming from people running low on medicine or in need of fuel for their generators.\n\n\"We are with you, we love you, we hope that things get better real soon,\" Parton assured the crowd.",
      "# [Miley Cyrus and Dolly Parton are apparently distant relatives by Alli Rosenbloom on 2024-09-23](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/23/entertainment/miley-cyrus-dolly-parton-related-ancestry/index.html)\nDolly Parton has learned her special connection with goddaughter Miley Cyrus is even deeper than she originally thought.\n\nGenealogy and family tree tracking site Ancestry announced on Monday that by using “billions of historical records and public family trees,” they’ve discovered that the two music powerhouses are actually seventh cousins, once removed.\n\nTheir common ancestor is a man named John Brickey, who was born in Virginia in 1740, according to Ancestry. Brickey is Parton’s sixth great-grandfather and Cyrus’ seventh great-grandfather.\n\n“We’re so close, Miley and I. I’d have thought we’d have been at least third cousins,” Parton said on Monday’s episode of Access Hollywood, reacting to the revelation. “It doesn’t surprise me because she does feel like family.”\n\nParton is Cyrus’ godmother and previously appeared on several episodes of the Disney Channel show “Hannah Montana” playing Cyrus’ aunt.\n\nThe pair have always been vocal about their closeness, something Cyrus touched on in a tribute to Parton that she penned for Time Magazine’s 100 Most Influential People of 2021.\n\n“Dolly is not only my idol because of her incomparable career—she’s also my role model because of her steadfast morals and values,” Cyrus wrote. “She recognizes how impactful her choices will be as one of the most iconic and powerful voices in country music, and she leaves no one behind.”\n\nThe timing of this news is poignant considering Parton is gearing up to release her new family-centric album “Dolly Parton & Family: Smoky Mountain DNA – Family, Faith & Fables” in November.",
      "# [Dolly Parton and Her Goddaughter, Miley Cyrus, Are Seventh Cousins Once Removed by Samantha Riedel, Catherine Mhloyi, Quispe López, James Factora, Abby Monteil, Mathew Rodriguez on 2024-09-25](https://www.them.us/story/dolly-parton-miley-cyrus-related-ancestry-dot-com)\nSign up for The Agenda — Them’s news and politics newsletter, delivered to your inbox every Thursday.\n\nTurns out Miley Cyrus and Dolly Parton have more in common than just Jolene taking their men — they’re also connected by blood.\n\nParton has been Cyrus’s godmother for most of her life, but the two stars — who last performed together at Cyrus’s New Year’s 2023 show — are actually related, as Ancestry.com revealed in a blog post this week. Not only do the two share a spiritual connection, they’re also seventh cousins, once removed, according to the genealogy-tracking service.\n\nCyrus and Parton both share a common ancestor in John Brickey, who was born in Virginia in 1740 and later moved to Blount County, Tennessee, where he died in 1806 at age 66. As Billboard noted, Brickey made his home just 20 miles away from the modern-day site of Parton’s Dollywood theme park and resort. Parton is descended from Brickey’s daughter Mary, while Cyrus traces her lineage back through his other daughter, Elizabeth.\n\n“Is that true? That’s amazing!” exclaimed Parton when surprised with the news in an Access Hollywood interview this week. “Well, we’re so close, Miley and I, I would’ve thought we’d have been at least third cousins 10 times removed,” she quipped. “I’m sure she’ll get a kick out of that. But it doesn’t surprise me, because she does feel like family.”\n\nParton legendarily played “Aunt Dolly” on the Disney Channel show Hannah Montana, which catapulted Cyrus to child stardom. The two remained close long after the show’s end, sharing Southern comfort food and popular music stardom in equal measure, even covering one another’s most recognizable hits — Cyrus with her “Backyard Sessions” cover of the iconic “Jolene,” and Parton more recently with her take on “Wrecking Ball” (which still featured Cyrus on backing vocals) on Cyrus’ 2023 album Rockstar.\n\n“Dolly wrote to me to say: “How much do I love you? As much as my heart can hold and as far as my arms can reach.” It gets me choked up. I just love her so much,” Cyrus told W magazine earlier this summer.\n\nThis latest news can only bring the pop star duo closer together — if that’s even possible."
