If we do not reach settlement within a period of 60 days, then either of us may, by notice to the other demand mediation under the mediation rules of the American Arbitration Association in Seattle, Washington. We both give up our right to litigate our disputes and may not proceed to arbitration without first trying mediation, but you and Dolly are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief from the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Dolly will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.\n\nIf settlement is not reached within 60 days after service of a written demand for mediation, any unresolved controversy or claim will be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association before a single arbitrator in Seattle, Washington.

The arbitrator will render a written opinion including findings of fact and law and the award and/or determination of the arbitrator will be binding on the parties, and their respective administrators and assigns, and will not be subject to appeal. Judgment may be entered upon the award of the arbitrator in any court of competent jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration will be shared equally by the parties unless the arbitration determines that the expenses will be otherwise assessed and the prevailing party may be awarded its attorneys' fees and expenses by the arbitrator. It is the intent of the parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances, arbitration proceedings will be concluded within 90 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit only if failure to do so would unduly prejudice the rights of the parties. Failure to adhere to this time limit will not constitute a basis for challenging the award. Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, pre-hearing information exchange will be limited to the reasonable production of relevant, non-privileged documents, carried out expeditiously.\n\nFor any disputes between the Parties that are not handled by arbitration, you agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms and/or the subject matter covered by these Terms shall be filed only in the state and federal courts located in Seattle, Washington and the Parties each hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding between the Parties arising out of or relating these Terms and/or the subject matter covered by these Terms.\n\nGeneral\n\nEnforcement of these Terms is solely at Dolly's discretion. Failure to enforce any part of these Terms in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce the same or other part of these Terms in other instances.\n\nIf any provision of these Terms is or becomes unlawful, void or otherwise unenforceable (including the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations above), then that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.\n\nThe section headings of these Terms are for reference purposes only and will not affect the meaning or interpretation of these Terms.\n\nThese Terms (and terms or policies incorporated herein) make up the entire agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter covered herein, including access and use of Dolly Platform, Requests, and the Services, and they supersede any other terms, whether implied or expressed.\n\nContact Us\n\nIf you have any questions about these Terms, please email us at [email protected] or send a letter to:\n\nDolly, Inc.\n\n9450 SW Gemini Dr., PMB 43895\n\nBeaverton, Oregon 97008-7105\n\nNotice for California Users\n\nIf you are a California resident, you may have these Terms mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to the address above with your electronic mail address and a request for these Terms. Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California Website users are entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 1625 N. Market Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.\n\nNotice Regarding Apple\n\nApple, Inc. and Other Third-Party Beneficiaries. You acknowledge and agree that Apple, Inc. (\"Apple\") and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and further that (a) upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party; (b) these Terms are conducted between you and Dolly only, and not Apple; (c) Dolly, and not Apple, is solely responsible for the Dolly Platform and the content thereof provided by Dolly; (d) Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Dolly Platform; (e) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no warranty obligation with respect to the Dolly Platform; and Dolly, and not Apple, will be responsible for any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure of the Dolly Platform to conform to any applicable warranty; (f) in the event of any third party claim that the Dolly Platform or your possession and use of that Dolly Platform infringes that third party's intellectual property rights, Apple will not be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim; and (g) Apple will not be responsible for addressing any of your claims or any third party claims relating to the Dolly Platform or your possession and/or use of the Dolly Platform, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Dolly Platform fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.\n\nNotice Regarding Damage Protection\n\nPlease note that Damage Protection only applies to the goods being transported. It does not protect damage to the environment surrounding the Dolly (e.g. floors, walls, ceiling, etc.). Additionally, for Damage Protection and insurance purposes, the value of any given item is considered to be the lesser of (a) the price at which it was most recently purchased (last 12 months), or (b) the cost of replacement, as may be reasonably determined by Dolly. Further, the value of such an item is determined independently of the amount of any supplemental Damage Protection purchased from Dolly (in addition to the $300 of complimentary Damage Protection provided by Dolly). For example, if $1,000 of supplemental Damage Protection were purchased, the recent purchase price was $300, and the cost of replacement were $400, then Damage Protection would cover $300. Dolly reserves the right to reject any claims of damage not submitted within 14 days of the damaging incident. Dolly is not responsible for any damage that is incurred outside of the express-written parameters of the move as purchased by the customer. Any act undertaken by our independent contractors that is not explicitly paid for may not qualify for Damage Protection.",

Taskrabbit reserves the right to share information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale, or any other type of acquisition or business combination of all or any portion of our assets, or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another business.\n\nPublic Areas.

There, you can view, update, and correct your Account information.\n\nSo that we may protect the integrity of the Taskrabbit Platform, there are certain pieces of information, such as your age, that you cannot alter yourself.

You may contact us at [email protected] if there is a need to make a correction to such data. Please see Section 11, Children’s Privacy, for more details.\n\nPromotional Communications.

Taskrabbit's Information Retention Policy\n\nWe retain personal data for as long as you are a User in order to meet our contractual obligations to you, and for such longer period as may be in our legitimate interests and to comply with our legal obligations (see Exhibit A for exemplar document retention periods). We may also retain data from which you cannot directly be identified, for example where stored against a randomly-generated identifier so we know the data relates to a single User, but we cannot tell who that User is. We use this kind of data for research purposes and to help us develop and improve our services, and we take appropriate measures to ensure you cannot be re-identified from this data.\n\n9. Taskrabbit’s Security of Collected Information\n\nYour Taskrabbit account is password-protected so that only you and authorized Taskrabbit staff have access to your account information. In order to maintain this protection, do not give your password to anyone. Also, if you share a computer, you should sign out of your Taskrabbit account and close the browser window before someone else logs on. This will help protect your information entered on public terminals from disclosure to third parties.\n\nTaskrabbit implements and maintains reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security safeguards to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Taskrabbit has staff dedicated to maintaining this Privacy Policy and other privacy initiatives, periodically reviewing security, and making sure that every Taskrabbit employee is aware of our security practices. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of information about you.\n\n10.

The bad experiences kept piling up and NOTHING was done to make it right despite reaching out to the customer concern team numerous times, trying to give them a chance. \n\nThe support is absolutely garbage. They don’t even have a number to reach if there is an immediate emergency (which more often than not, issues arise). You can leave a voicemail over phone then wait about 3 days for a response or send an email and again, wait some time to hear back. Not very helpful when in a pinch. \n\nThey used to pay well, now the wages are a joke for the drive time/work time combination (at least here in CA). Is $20 worth driving 25 miles each way to load and unload a couch worth it? With gas near 5 dollars a gallon, not so much. Sad part is they can afford to give their workers quite a bit more or actually pay for a support team!!\n\nWhat really irks me is that this company literally only has to pay the help (us) and their little bit of staff,  meaning they have very little overhead.

Their customer service is based on the Middle East. They all have heavy accent. They don’t know how expensive is to live in the United States. All their gigs jobs are low pay. They think that an extra $20 is a lot to us. You can not ask for more pay when the job is more work. Customers can literally put whatever they want on the job description so it can be less money. Customers and the app take advantage of this platform. Instead of paying us the same or more for a job, they pay us less. I worked for them for over 3 years. I was one of their best drivers.

      "https://apple/9427250451": "# Less than minimum wage, 1 stars [(Mneurp, Apple App Store, 2022-12-23)](https://apple/9427250451)\nJust finished my first 2 Dollys. One was a delivery route for The Container Store with 5 different deliveries all over L.A. it said there would be a tip for each delivery, but the tip was $0 for the whole route. It took 3.5 hours (locations were far apart) and paid $55. Used at least $20 in gas. One of the deliveries was to an $11 million dollar house in Beverly Hills. I don’t know if Dolly is pocketing the tips, or if there were really 0 out of 5 people that tipped. Either way it is less than minimum wage and not worth it. The 2nd Dolly I did was to move a dresser for $37. The dresser was very heavy and the location we delivered it to had a staircase that looked like it was designed by someone trying to make a staircase that was impossible to carry furniture up. It was the worst. After we finished, The client said they have had several delivery people just leave things at the bottom of the stairs and refuse to even try. Both of these jobs I knew would only be worth it when including a tip. Not one of them tipped. That 2nd client saw us laboring and dripping sweat and struggling to carry a heavy piece of furniture up the worst set of stairs. I have lost a little bit of my faith in humanity, my whole body hurts, and I’m never working Dolly again. You can make more money with Instacart or Uber Eats or anything but this. It’s not worth it. They need to pay more, or make the client tip beforehand like Postmates does. Then we can consider if we want to do the job. When you give people an option to tip after the service is provided, we apparently get screwed 6 out of 6 times. We aren’t waiters who should be tipped after providing good service with a smile. We are moving heavy things into small places and should know how much we are going to make beforehand. The tip should be made beforehand, and we can consider it when deciding whether or not to take the job.",

I put in 10am on the website, however the app sent the helpers at 9am. 10am is when the store opens for pickup. They canceled because of this flaw, because they couldn't wait.

The bad experiences kept piling up and NOTHING was done to make it right despite reaching out to the customer concern team numerous times, trying to give them a chance. \n\nThe support is absolutely garbage. They don’t even have a number to reach if there is an immediate emergency (which more often than not, issues arise). You can leave a voicemail over phone then wait about 3 days for a response or send an email and again, wait some time to hear back. Not very helpful when in a pinch. \n\nThey used to pay well, now the wages are a joke for the drive time/work time combination (at least here in CA). Is $20 worth driving 25 miles each way to load and unload a couch worth it? With gas near 5 dollars a gallon, not so much. Sad part is they can afford to give their workers quite a bit more or actually pay for a support team!!\n\nWhat really irks me is that this company literally only has to pay the help (us) and their little bit of staff,  meaning they have very little overhead.

We rely on our app to match available helpers to the open Dollys in each market and no longer manually assign Helpers to Dollys upon request.\n\nIf you are consistently experiencing issue being assigned to open Dolly's your preferences may be contradicting the Dollys you are requesting. Our system determines eligibility of each Helper based on all their preferences: Day of the week, timing, and Hands/Assistant preferences. Updating your preferences to remove any specifics that no longer apply will improve your eligibility and help reduce any issues you may be experiencing.\n\nIf you have an issue separate from the one described above please respond detailing the issue you are experiencing and we'd be happy to help. Keep in mind I have a helper I have more than enough space in my enclosed cargo trailer. Can someone please tell me what the requirements are to make deliveries or be assigned deliveries from Rove Concepts?",

I showed them all the proof, they still refuse to try to find a resolution. Every rep I’ve talked to is extremely condescending, rude, unprofessional, and hard to explain. But then again being in a 3rd world country I don’t expect them to care about delivering quality service when what they charged me for cancelling last minute is probably what they make in a day",
      "# App needs a rewrite, 2 stars [(MissChargers619, Apple App Store, 2023-12-19)](https://apple/10718869236)\nWhenever I get a notification of a job most times if the job is significant in value it tells me it’s been taken before I can even review it. What happened to the countdown? Even when I go to review it right away, same thing. How are the $100+ jobs always gone immediately, (bots?). Also, in the past if I had waited say 5 seconds before reviewing a job it meant my count down clock wouldn’t start for seconds which wouldn’t allow me to accept a job until 5 seconds later than anyone who had started reviewing it before me. Why not just start everyone’s clock at the same time? Finally, as a driver you are always asking me to give up a portion of my potential earnings to secure helpers, seems to me you should rework your business model.",

      "# Less than minimum wage, 1 stars [(Mneurp, Apple App Store, 2022-12-23)](https://apple/9427250451)\nJust finished my first 2 Dollys. One was a delivery route for The Container Store with 5 different deliveries all over L.A. it said there would be a tip for each delivery, but the tip was $0 for the whole route. It took 3.5 hours (locations were far apart) and paid $55. Used at least $20 in gas. One of the deliveries was to an $11 million dollar house in Beverly Hills. I don’t know if Dolly is pocketing the tips, or if there were really 0 out of 5 people that tipped. Either way it is less than minimum wage and not worth it. The 2nd Dolly I did was to move a dresser for $37. The dresser was very heavy and the location we delivered it to had a staircase that looked like it was designed by someone trying to make a staircase that was impossible to carry furniture up. It was the worst. After we finished, The client said they have had several delivery people just leave things at the bottom of the stairs and refuse to even try. Both of these jobs I knew would only be worth it when including a tip. Not one of them tipped. That 2nd client saw us laboring and dripping sweat and struggling to carry a heavy piece of furniture up the worst set of stairs. I have lost a little bit of my faith in humanity, my whole body hurts, and I’m never working Dolly again. You can make more money with Instacart or Uber Eats or anything but this. It’s not worth it. They need to pay more, or make the client tip beforehand like Postmates does. Then we can consider if we want to do the job. When you give people an option to tip after the service is provided, we apparently get screwed 6 out of 6 times. We aren’t waiters who should be tipped after providing good service with a smile. We are moving heavy things into small places and should know how much we are going to make beforehand. The tip should be made beforehand, and we can consider it when deciding whether or not to take the job.",

I’ve always thought these might be better for moving around light empty utility trailers.\n\nI live on a fairly busy road so sometimes backing in my boat can take awhile to find the right break in traffic to pull across both lanes to back up.\n\nI have a longer driveway and was debating on picking up one of these dollys. My thinking is I could pull straight in, disconnect, and then use the dolly to swing the boat 180 for the next time I’m ready to take it back out. It’s a smaller speed boat so I imagine tongue weight is roughly 300-400lbs.\n\nAny thoughts if this is a good option? Or should I go with a beefier dolly?\n\n## Comment ID jitr2rd with +29 score by [(Guyton_Oulder, Reddit, 2023-05-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/harborfreight/comments/137jvvm/trailer_dolly_with_boat/jitr2rd/) (in reply to ID 137jvvm):\nThe purpose of the dolly is to relieve you of having to both push the trailer (boat or utility) and carry the tongue weight of the trailer.\n\nThe 600 lb capacity is the maximum tongue weight it can be expected to carry.\n\nIt doesn't mean that 600 pounds is the maximum weight of the loaded trailer.\n\nIt also gives some degree of steerability.  \n\nBe aware that this thing doesn't have brakes, and neither does the trailer, if it's not connected to a tow vehicle. \n\nDon't try using this on a hill to move a 25 foot boat.

Both houses have wood flooring.\n\nWe'll probably use a pickup truck to transport it.  A lift gate truck would be nice, but probably not attainable.\n\nWhat do I need to easily move the fridge ?\n\n\\- furniture sliders ?\n\n\\- appliance dolly ?\n\n\\- ratchet straps ?\n\n\\- moving blankets ?\n\n\\- ramps to get in the back of the pickup truck ?\n\n**Update**\n\nThe fridge has been moved. \n\nI hired a guy with a pickup truck.  My buddy brought his furniture dolly.\n\nWe strapped the fridge to the furniture dolly and wheeled it out to the truck.   We put the back of the dolly against the endgate.  Two guys on the bottom of the fridge, one guy in the bed of the truck pulling up.   It went up easily.  As soon as the fridge leans back, the tailgate is holding half the weight of the fridge. \n\nWe rolled the dolly was against the front of the box.  We strapped the dolly to the front of the box and also to the back of the box with ratchet straps. It was very secure.\n\nUnloading was reverse of loading.  Lean the fridge back and wheel it to the edge of the tailgate.  Then slowly edge it over while 2 guys help from the ground.   It helps to have a dolly that has skids or tracks just above the wheels that are level with the back of the wheels, like this one.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0ojuGCkmNg\n\nI had to remove the doors and drawer fronts to get it through the door in my house.

Don’t forget to turn off the water supply first. Anyways they’re all top heavy so most delivery guys bring them in with forearm forklifts and use an appliance dolly just to get to the front door. It’s a pain in the ass to roll inside sense the fridge outweighs you and doorways need you to really tip to clear them.\n\n## Comment ID j6u4wku with +1 score by [(NagromYargTrebloc, Reddit, 2023-02-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tools/comments/10r4vsr/what_do_i_need_to_easily_move_a_350_pound/j6u4wku/) (in reply to ID 10r4vsr):\nRent an appliance dolly.

It's nonsense. Go rent a 15 ft U-Haul with a pullout ramp. \n\nIf you want to cheap out on a hand truck use U-Haul's and throw a ratchet strap around the hand truck and the fridge. It works but it's makeshift. If you want to do it right rent a Reefer dolly and make sure it has stair climbers (treads on the back)\n\nRent a 6 pack of pads from U-Haul as well. Before you get it in the house lay 3-4 once folded pads on top of one another. Roll the fridge onto the end of the pad stack and grab the other end to drag it through the house. Pull it slow and make sure you don't scratch the floor.\n\nAlso measure everything before you get the fridge to the door and realize it doesn't fit\n\nGood luck 🤙\n\n## Comment ID j6wrl35 with +1 score by [(jjones20202020, Reddit, 2023-02-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tools/comments/10r4vsr/what_do_i_need_to_easily_move_a_350_pound/j6wrl35/) (in reply to ID 10r4vsr):\n350lbs is not that bad.  Shoulder lifting straps with a second person will make getting it to a pickup truck cake.  Remove anything from inside you can to make it lighter and less destructive. From there set it on the ground.  Put down a moving blanket or two.   \n Rotate it to whichever side you like.  Lean it slowly into the back of the truck until the side contacts the truck.  Lift the back end of it (will be easy for one person).  Slide it in slowly.  When you unload it do the reverse, just be careful it doesn't slide when you tip it out.

One thing to keep in mind with a moving truck, it will not have much power, they don't care.  So on any kind of grade, especially towing your car, you WILL get passed on the uphill.  I have moved quite a few times in the last 8 years (LA to Detroit was 2200 miles, and Detroit to Portland, OR 2500 miles among others).  \n\nOne thing I'd say, and this comes down to YOUR comfort level, how do you feel about a 2 lane road compared to interstate?  \n\nThe bottom route diverts on to US 54, SW into Tucumcari, NM.  It's a well maintained road, but it is for most of the duration a 2 lane national highway.  You will be going through small to moderate towns and this will slow you down.  If you stay on I 35 South to Oklahoma City, then take I 40 west you will essentially be on the same route, but on the smoother, simpler interstate system.  The fun part of this is that theoretically, due to the higher speed limits, it's about the same time, at least for a car.  Depending on which company you've chosen, you may have a speed limiter in the truck.  I always chose Penske, and they limit to 70 MPH, so going on I 40 isn't faster, because the limit on that road is 75 MPH, but the limit on most of US 54 is 65 MPH.  \n\nI moved from Twin Cities to Phoenix in 2016, so I understand the fun you're going through, moving has it's challenges, but it's fun.  I'd also recommend you pre-plan and book your hotels in advance.  It gives you good points to make sure you stay on your schedule.\n\n## Comment ID lpfth54 with +1 score by [(timesuck47, Reddit, 2024-09-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/roadtrip/comments/1frh50p/easiest_drive_from_msp_to_la_with_moving_truck/lpfth54/) (in reply to ID 1frh50p):\nNOT through Colorado.\n\n## Comment ID lpg62m7 with +1 score by [(GearhedMG, Reddit, 2024-09-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/roadtrip/comments/1frh50p/easiest_drive_from_msp_to_la_with_moving_truck/lpg62m7/) (in reply to ID 1frh50p):\nAs a fellow Minnesotan that is now in the LA Metro Area, I would like to say welcome!

I have done a cross country trip with both (not with Rav4).  I found the car carrier a bit more cumbersome to maneuver in parking lots but otherwise it was not difficult.  I was a 20-something female at the time (still a female).  You will need a friend to get the car up on the carrier (to help direct you).\n\nIf it is manual transmission you may be able to tow it with just the front wheels off the ground but I am not sure.  You would have to check the manual but I think AWD has to be all wheels off the ground.\n\n### Comment ID j8sxomg with +2 score by [(Royal_Profile8301, Reddit, 2023-02-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rav4club/comments/113bbr7/has_anyone_towed_a_rav41_awd_on_a_tow_dolly/j8sxomg/) (in reply to ID j8plfd5):\n“(Still a female)” got me 😂\n\n## Comment ID j8plv9l with +7 score by [(brianandrobyn, Reddit, 2023-02-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rav4club/comments/113bbr7/has_anyone_towed_a_rav41_awd_on_a_tow_dolly/j8plv9l/) (in reply to ID 113bbr7):\nAWD needs to be on a trailer instead of a dolly.\n\n## Comment ID j8pxn2y with +3 score by [(MarijadderallMD, Reddit, 2023-02-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rav4club/comments/113bbr7/has_anyone_towed_a_rav41_awd_on_a_tow_dolly/j8pxn2y/) (in reply to ID 113bbr7):\nCar trailer with all 4 wheels up. uhaul rents them for fairly cheap! I tossed it on the back of one of their 20ft moving trucks and went across states, it’s not bad! They tell you that once the trailer is hooked up they don’t want you taking it off but if you know how and take a picture of how they had it, it’s not bad. Makes it hard to load a box truck without a ramp if the car trailer is on it😅\n\n\n\n## Comment ID j8qfaro with +1 score by [(slimypeter, Reddit, 2023-02-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rav4club/comments/113bbr7/has_anyone_towed_a_rav41_awd_on_a_tow_dolly/j8qfaro/) (in reply to ID 113bbr7):\nAlso, damn near impossible to back up a car dolly with car attached so trailer makes most sense\n\n## Comment ID j8qgo7s with +1 score by [(Friendly-Marketing46, Reddit, 2023-02-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rav4club/comments/113bbr7/has_anyone_towed_a_rav41_awd_on_a_tow_dolly/j8qgo7s/) (in reply to ID 113bbr7):\nLove love love that Gen\n\n## Comment ID j8rtkob with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-02-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rav4club/comments/113bbr7/has_anyone_towed_a_rav41_awd_on_a_tow_dolly/j8rtkob/) (in reply to ID 113bbr7):\nThat thing is sweet.

The bad experiences kept piling up and NOTHING was done to make it right despite reaching out to the customer concern team numerous times, trying to give them a chance. \n\nThe support is absolutely garbage. They don’t even have a number to reach if there is an immediate emergency (which more often than not, issues arise). You can leave a voicemail over phone then wait about 3 days for a response or send an email and again, wait some time to hear back. Not very helpful when in a pinch. \n\nThey used to pay well, now the wages are a joke for the drive time/work time combination (at least here in CA). Is $20 worth driving 25 miles each way to load and unload a couch worth it? With gas near 5 dollars a gallon, not so much. Sad part is they can afford to give their workers quite a bit more or actually pay for a support team!!\n\nWhat really irks me is that this company literally only has to pay the help (us) and their little bit of staff,  meaning they have very little overhead. Although, like all other companies in today’s world, they are greedy and could give a **** about the people actually doing the work. Instead they take advantage and exploit hard working honest people on the daily.",

When you have someone (like a spouse) who can work with you, they’ll tell you to setup as a team rather than an individual helper and hands. When you do this, you get paid LESS than when you register separately. This is a ploy to make more money for the company. Those savings are not passed on to the customer. \n\nBeyond this, job descriptions and sizes are often inaccurate. Support claims quick response times but average 3-24hrs. Sometimes they don’t respond at all. Decent money can be made but you’ll have to deal with the frustrations. Also, dolly posts pay rates low and only increases to what they are able to pay if no one takes the job. They make massive profits by lowballing us contractors.",

Because they pay very low, once I needed a helper for one hour and try to hire one from Dolly. Usually they pay $30/hr, but at the end were asking me to pay more than $80/hr for one person. Do the calculations and think if it’s worth it even to open an account with them. I paid $25 fee, lost hours to complete the account and at the end, all it’s wasted. How someone will say that it’s easy to work with. Even if you bid for a job, most likely you won’t get it because they decide who will. If you do that, why don’t you just give it to the person you want. That’s why the moving companies have dispatch.",

The way they let you know is in tiny things, small change, scheduling and in a hundred other ways that is always taken out of your pocket.  For example, the algorithm will not let you take other jobs in the same directions so you could make up those tolls and gas,  it would rather give this miserly job pay to another sucker that didn’t want to be an office rat, or they would judge in their favor when the dump fees are involved,  stating one thing on the job detail and then stiffing you like a petty thief after you paid those fees out of pocket, all in a fairly good office language, polite, exact and rotten as their job descriptions are.   \nIf you complain of low earnings, being stiffed by them for dump fees, etc., this is when the true nature of this business comes out - your payout is lowered and there is nothing you can do about it.

And even in the Dolly app it says I have one last minute cancel from November yet they still claim I have 2 in the last 90 days when the app/my profile clearly states one. I showed them all the proof, they still refuse to try to find a resolution. Every rep I’ve talked to is extremely condescending, rude, unprofessional, and hard to explain.

One was a delivery route for The Container Store with 5 different deliveries all over L.A. it said there would be a tip for each delivery, but the tip was $0 for the whole route. It took 3.5 hours (locations were far apart) and paid $55. Used at least $20 in gas. One of the deliveries was to an $11 million dollar house in Beverly Hills. I don’t know if Dolly is pocketing the tips, or if there were really 0 out of 5 people that tipped. Either way it is less than minimum wage and not worth it. The 2nd Dolly I did was to move a dresser for $37. The dresser was very heavy and the location we delivered it to had a staircase that looked like it was designed by someone trying to make a staircase that was impossible to carry furniture up. It was the worst. After we finished, The client said they have had several delivery people just leave things at the bottom of the stairs and refuse to even try. Both of these jobs I knew would only be worth it when including a tip. Not one of them tipped. That 2nd client saw us laboring and dripping sweat and struggling to carry a heavy piece of furniture up the worst set of stairs. I have lost a little bit of my faith in humanity, my whole body hurts, and I’m never working Dolly again. You can make more money with Instacart or Uber Eats or anything but this. It’s not worth it. They need to pay more, or make the client tip beforehand like Postmates does. Then we can consider if we want to do the job. When you give people an option to tip after the service is provided, we apparently get screwed 6 out of 6 times. We aren’t waiters who should be tipped after providing good service with a smile. We are moving heavy things into small places and should know how much we are going to make beforehand. The tip should be made beforehand, and we can consider it when deciding whether or not to take the job.",

The overall attitude towards Operations &amp; Support (customer success), from a company-wide level, needs to change. One of your founders regularly bad mouths them as second class employees. \r\n\r\nIf you start respecting your people they will go to war for you. Compensate them properly so they don't have to stay at home to work, because they literally cant afford bus fare. On that note, probably best with a downtown office to provide some sort of commuter pass help, which almost every single company downtown provides. \r\n\r\nIt is possible to improve, but Leadership and management would all need to take a hard look in the mirror and see that they are the cause of many issues. Realize that people who get treated well by companies as employees, work harder and stick around. When employees for the Operations department are regularly surfacing that they feel grossly under compensated, LISTEN. The reasoning that \"its within low market average\" doesn't cut it if there is a complete department turnover in 6 months. \r\n\r\nIf you were compensating properly, respecting your employees, and honoring  work/life balance, would everyone be leaving at such a high rate? (100% of Support/Customer Success Agents left from 6 months ago) \r\n\r\nDolly is an amazing idea but my experience with management soured me so much, it is hard for me to root for them as a company.",

This is a very hard pill to swallow when you work more than 50+ hours per week, and then find out that many other departments employees are making 2X your salary, and not even working 40 hours a week. \r\n\r\nDon't plan on holidays and weekends being off limits for a Manager non-stop texting you about work, or to get on your laptop because that Manager cannot properly hire, staff-out, train, nor retain Support Agents for their team. There was more than one occurrence where I had to repeatedly ask this manager to stop texting me about work, because I was with my family on Thanksgiving. This was a regular occurrence during weekends.  I have worked for a number of startups in various stages, the team at Dolly will tell you this is normal....it is not. \r\n\r\nIf you do get promoted up the very short ladder available, more and more will be asked of you, which is great until you realize that you're doing multiple jobs responsibilities and not getting anywhere near compensated for your time and work. \r\n\r\nUnlimited PTO is completely false for the Operations team. In my experience, I was flat out denied a vacation which was for a friends wedding. I was also made to come in on a day requested off. These kind of things do not happen at companies that value people and their lives outside of work.",

          "cons": "Despite selling the vision of upper mobility, increased staffing/funding, the truth becomes apparent quite quickly. If you're hired at an hourly role for the support roles, you start at less than minimum wage (because they are a startup they don't need to match this yet), and are told that eventually you may be able to transition into a salaried position with full benefits. This won't be the case until you serve at least 2 years and meet every requirement. Given the current track record, you'll either quit or get let go before you get there. \r\n\r\nBe prepared to work anytime between 5AM and 9PM, any day of the week including (and especially) Saturdays/Sundays. An email/text from management at odd hours expecting a response on days off is not uncommon.\r\n\r\nIn the Ops team, the expectations to work harder and smarter than anyone else, while being underpaid and also being responsible for any shortcomings will take a toll on your mental health. \r\n\r\nThe Customer \"Success\" team is expected to be working non-stop by urgently handling every request that comes in the help desk via phone calls, emails, text messages,  etc. Being on the phone for 4+ hours a day is not uncommon, most of which is spent dealing with highly stressful situations and unpleasant customers and contractors that work for the company.\r\n\r\nManagement is not shy of publicly shaming any shortcomings, but is conservative when providing any praise or incentives to keep up the work. \r\n\r\nParking for the building is $200/mo, and there is no program to reimburse you for your transit costs. Even if you're working on an hourly rate of $14 in one of the most expensive cities in the country. The cost of getting to and from work will essentially mean you work at least 15 hours to cover your bus fares for the month.\r\n\r\nFor a being a technology company that started off with a mobile app, it's incredibly frustrating to see that the app is still plagued with issues. Customers and contractors that work for the company in the field will report and complain about app problems every day but with the entire app team consisting of 1 or 2 developers( without a product manager), it is crippling the progress of the company. The unfortunate truth is that these developers are spending the vast majority of their time troubleshooting and bug fixing rather than releasing new features.\r\n\r\nBusiness development forges new partnerships with stores in markets all the time, but does not take into account how the customers that shop at these stores fit the persona for the company. Having to make \"one-time exceptions\" all the time, and ultimately have to provide a negative experience due to customer expectations is not worth it. \r\n\r\nBottom line, there are false promises being made all around. The company has an excellent product idea, and solves a real problem. However, the entire focus is around the customers (who have zero brand loyalty) rather than the employees and the contractors that are actually providing the service. \r\n\r\nA bad apple here or there is excusable. But when there have been over 10 employees that have either quit or been let go for the same management reasons, it serves to show there is a common denominator that poor leadership is causing the company to suffer and prevent healthy growth.",

The best way to keep your job is to keep your head down and work\r\n\r\nExpect your direct boss to be an often-dishonest and (at the very least) a poor communicator and do not be surprised when something said to you in person (i.e. a praise, an expectation, etc) is changed or contradicted in an inconsiderate, impersonal manner via a late-night,  cryptic email or performance review to fit their underlying motive or narrative\r\n\r\nExpect mid-level Ops management and the company leadership as a whole to not care at all about you, your short/long-term career development or goals, etc\r\n\r\nExpect the day-to-day work to increase your stress levels and decrease your mental health\r\nExpect to be answering phone calls for 4-6+ hours/shift\r\nExpect the Spring/Summer (especially end of month shifts) to be some of the most stress-inducing and soul-crushing experiences imaginable, with a never-ending stream of customers and contractors constantly calling, texting, and emailing you their problems/disputes/grievances while being anywhere on from curious to mildly frustrated to downright irate, screaming/swearing at the top of their lungs at you for something that has gone wrong during their move\r\n\r\nExpect any shortcoming of other teams/departments to be shoveled into Ops’ long list of responsibilities, especially technical bugs and problems, which the Dolly app is riddled with \r\n\r\nExpect a constantly changing set of managerial expectations or  \"S.O.P.'s (standard operating procedures) for various customer support scenarios. Make sure to stay up to date on these,  as you can/will be punished for doing something today, which you were allowed to do yesterday\r\n\r\nExpect, during busy times (spring, summer, end of months) to have 50-100+ or more urgent  customer/contract emails and texts to respond to, but also be expected to answer every incoming phone call and return every single voicemail or phone sale from impatient customers who refuse to create a Dolly on the app by themselves, regardless of how many more urgent issues await your response\r\n\r\nExpect some of these grief and stress-filled scenarios to happen while the rest of the company enjoys leisurely afternoon h'oeuvres d'oeuvres parties, (therein lies a glimpse into the 1st/2nd class company division)\r\n\r\nExpect Dolly to internally identify itself as a scrappy startup that values putting customers first. \r\nExpect to discover this^ to be nothing but hot air when you have 50+ angry customers and contractors urgently awaiting help/responses from your paper thin-stretched, understaffed support team, and the rest of the company ignores your teams’ cries for help because pizza\r\n\r\nExpect to be misled regarding  potential for growth/promotion/upward mobility. Do not make the big mistake of thinking ANY patience/loyalty/long hours will be rewarded if you decide you want to climb the short ladder that exists within the Ops team/company\r\n\r\nExpect the dangling carrot on a stick metaphor to be an apt one for your prospects of becoming a salaried employee\r\n\r\nIf you do get promoted into a mid-level, salaried Operations role, expect the concept of work/life balance to not exist. Whereas in other jobs this might be true or worth it because of compensation, expect that that won’t be the case at Dolly and that your skills will be compensated well-below market rate for Seattle\r\n\r\nIf salaried, expect that to succeed in completing your new job responsibilities, you'll have to increase your weekly hours to that of an employee who makes double or triple your salary, and expect that complaining about this injustice could/will eventually lead to your termination\r\n\r\nExpect extremely high turnover in entry-level positions, which will lead to you/mid-level salaried Ops employees having to work overtime in order to appease the unrealistic expectations set by “leadership”",

If you're hired at an hourly role for the support roles, you start at less than minimum wage (because they are a startup they don't need to match this yet), and are told that eventually you may be able to transition into a salaried position with full benefits. This won't be the case until you serve at least 2 years and meet every requirement. Given the current track record, you'll either quit or get let go before you get there. \r\n\r\nBe prepared to work anytime between 5AM and 9PM, any day of the week including (and especially) Saturdays/Sundays. An email/text from management at odd hours expecting a response on days off is not uncommon.\r\n\r\nIn the Ops team, the expectations to work harder and smarter than anyone else, while being underpaid and also being responsible for any shortcomings will take a toll on your mental health. \r\n\r\nThe Customer \"Success\" team is expected to be working non-stop by urgently handling every request that comes in the help desk via phone calls, emails, text messages,  etc. Being on the phone for 4+ hours a day is not uncommon, most of which is spent dealing with highly stressful situations and unpleasant customers and contractors that work for the company.\r\n\r\nManagement is not shy of publicly shaming any shortcomings, but is conservative when providing any praise or incentives to keep up the work. \r\n\r\nParking for the building is $200/mo, and there is no program to reimburse you for your transit costs. Even if you're working on an hourly rate of $14 in one of the most expensive cities in the country. The cost of getting to and from work will essentially mean you work at least 15 hours to cover your bus fares for the month.\r\n\r\nFor a being a technology company that started off with a mobile app, it's incredibly frustrating to see that the app is still plagued with issues. Customers and contractors that work for the company in the field will report and complain about app problems every day but with the entire app team consisting of 1 or 2 developers( without a product manager), it is crippling the progress of the company. The unfortunate truth is that these developers are spending the vast majority of their time troubleshooting and bug fixing rather than releasing new features.\r\n\r\nBusiness development forges new partnerships with stores in markets all the time, but does not take into account how the customers that shop at these stores fit the persona for the company. Having to make \"one-time exceptions\" all the time, and ultimately have to provide a negative experience due to customer expectations is not worth it. \r\n\r\nBottom line, there are false promises being made all around. The company has an excellent product idea, and solves a real problem. However, the entire focus is around the customers (who have zero brand loyalty) rather than the employees and the contractors that are actually providing the service. \r\n\r\nA bad apple here or there is excusable. But when there have been over 10 employees that have either quit or been let go for the same management reasons, it serves to show there is a common denominator that poor leadership is causing the company to suffer and prevent healthy growth.",

The overall attitude towards Operations &amp; Support (customer success), from a company-wide level, needs to change. One of your founders regularly bad mouths them as second class employees. \r\n\r\nIf you start respecting your people they will go to war for you. Compensate them properly so they don't have to stay at home to work, because they literally cant afford bus fare. On that note, probably best with a downtown office to provide some sort of commuter pass help, which almost every single company downtown provides. \r\n\r\nIt is possible to improve, but Leadership and management would all need to take a hard look in the mirror and see that they are the cause of many issues. Realize that people who get treated well by companies as employees, work harder and stick around. When employees for the Operations department are regularly surfacing that they feel grossly under compensated, LISTEN. The reasoning that \"its within low market average\" doesn't cut it if there is a complete department turnover in 6 months. \r\n\r\nIf you were compensating properly, respecting your employees, and honoring  work/life balance, would everyone be leaving at such a high rate? (100% of Support/Customer Success Agents left from 6 months ago) \r\n\r\nDolly is an amazing idea but my experience with management soured me so much, it is hard for me to root for them as a company.",

This is a very hard pill to swallow when you work more than 50+ hours per week, and then find out that many other departments employees are making 2X your salary, and not even working 40 hours a week. \r\n\r\nDon't plan on holidays and weekends being off limits for a Manager non-stop texting you about work, or to get on your laptop because that Manager cannot properly hire, staff-out, train, nor retain Support Agents for their team. There was more than one occurrence where I had to repeatedly ask this manager to stop texting me about work, because I was with my family on Thanksgiving. This was a regular occurrence during weekends.  I have worked for a number of startups in various stages, the team at Dolly will tell you this is normal....it is not. \r\n\r\nIf you do get promoted up the very short ladder available, more and more will be asked of you, which is great until you realize that you're doing multiple jobs responsibilities and not getting anywhere near compensated for your time and work. \r\n\r\nUnlimited PTO is completely false for the Operations team. In my experience, I was flat out denied a vacation which was for a friends wedding. I was also made to come in on a day requested off.

      "# [A Dolly Parton Party That Reminded Me Why Community Matters by Glennda Testone on 2025-03-12](https://joangarry.com/dolly-parton-community-matters/)\nNews flash: The world feels heavy right now. That isn’t really ‘news’ to most people. The doomscrolling isn’t helping. There are moments—more than a few—when I feel like just shutting down. But a few weekends ago, something happened that woke me up. It made me realize that shutting down is not the answer right now. I have a better idea.\n\nLast weekend, my spouse turned 50. It was an entire weekend of celebration. Not just because that is how Jama rolls and what Jama deserves, but it was what we all needed at this time.\n\nI realized it’s an antidote that could help many nonprofit leaders right now. Hear me out.\n\nOur event was called “Night of 1,000 Dollys.” Jama is from Mississippi. They grew up on country music and collard greens. Conversely, I am from New York. I didn’t even know what those things truly were until I met my spouse.\n\nThe event was great for a number of reasons. First, because it had a fun theme—Dolly Parton! Imagine the hair, the boots, and the boobs. See the image of my friend Stef above, dressed as Dolly. Second, it was held in a unique local venue, Over the Moon Art Studios in Asbury Park, NJ, and we were able to support all local vendors (food, drink, cupcakes, DJ, etc.) to execute the event.\n\nBut most importantly, the special sauce of the whole thing was the people. Our community—our birth families, our chosen families, our very best friends—came from far and wide to gather and celebrate each other and this person who brings us so much joy.\n\nHands down, my favorite moment of the evening was when the DJ played “Pink Pony Club” by Chappell Roan. If you aren’t familiar with it, I suggest you listen to the song. It goes, “…and I heard that there’s a special place where boys and girls can all be queens every single day… I’m gonna keep on dancing.”\n\nI am going to keep the spirit and the spark of that event inside me so that I can live and LEAD well. In fact, it reminded me that this has been a piece of my strategy whenever I face big challenges in the world.\n\nThat’s what I did during the rough times during my 14 years at the LGBT Community Center. I engaged deeply in the community and leveraged it to power my leadership. It fueled me. We fueled each other. This is what I do every day leading the Nonprofit Leadership Lab, when I go into the Village and find the people on the ground who are moving things forward and inspiring others to do the same, in spite of the current chaos and challenge.\n\nYou have to find what will work for you and your leadership during this time. So, here are some “powered by community” things to consider.\n\nGATHER. ESPECIALLY IN PERSON.\n\nComing together right now is not a “nice to have.” It’s a must-have. Don’t isolate, bring people together to cry, rage, and complain. This is important, but don’t stop there.\n\nFind joy, laughter, celebration, and ways to keep going together. Have a Zoom meeting coming up? See if that person can meet for coffee. It’s imperative for you and for your leadership.\n\nI was able to go to another transformational gathering, a celebration of a friend and colleague who was stepping down from his big nonprofit job after 15 years. It turned out that there were so many people there I knew and loved and had not seen in a while since I left my big non-profit job. It filled me up, in a way, that lingers weeks after the event.\n\nBE CREATIVE\n\nYou don’t need to throw a Dolly Parton-themed 50th birthday, but the old same-same won’t be as powerful. What does this moment call you and your organization to do?\n\nYou probably have board meetings and staff meetings coming up. How can they meet the moment in creative ways? Maybe it’s a good time to do a check-in at the board meeting and ask each member to share WHY they serve on the board right now. It will (re)connect each person to your mission, and I guarantee it will inspire.\n\nFor staff, perhaps people can share what they’re doing for self-care or what is keeping them going right now. It could inspire strategies for others to borrow from each other. You could even consider making it silly-fun and have people draw their answers. More than one board game requires this with hilarious results.\n\nRAISE YOUR VOICE\n\nStart with just you in the car singing/screaming to a song. Say it loud and say it proud! Then, join your voice with others, whether it’s to your staff, board, or community. They need to hear you, and you need to hear them.\n\nYou might not include it in a formal report or publish it in the press, but consider being more candid with your staff, board, or community where possible.\n\nWhen Trump was first elected in 2016, we held a gathering at The Center to allow people to come together, and we reminded them: “My Voice Counts”.\n\nIt was so restorative to everyone involved, and those who saw the community and member-created posters lining our walls afterward. And it led to the reinvention of the Center’s advocacy program—an enduring result that lives on today.\n\nFOCUS ON YOUR ENERGY\n\nThis is always important for leaders and for organizations, but it has never been more important than it is right now. Look at your mission, and remember the fundamental “why” of your existence.\n\nDifferent organizations will have different strategies in general, and especially at this moment. Regardless of what your purpose and strategy are, I urge you to FOCUS on that. This is not the time to try and be all the things or to do all the things. You can’t possibly react to everything, nor do you want to.\n\nStick to your strategic vision, like a North Star, and make sure you are putting your efforts into what will fuel you and your community. We’ll get through this, like we always have, together.\n\nSo, the moral of the story is that just like a party, a community doesn’t happen by accident—it’s something we create and nurture intentionally. And in a world that can feel overwhelming, those small moments of connection are what ground us to ourselves and each other. Whether you choose to laugh, dance, or scream, start building your community.\n\nYou don’t have to do it alone. Gathering with your community will amplify your impact.",
      "# [Brandi Cyrus Reacts to Learning She's Related to Dolly Parton on 2024-09-27](https://www.eonline.com/news/1407651/2024-pccas-brandi-cyrus-reacts-to-learning-she-and-miley-cyrus-are-related-to-dolly-parton)\nWatch : 2024 People’s Choice Country Awards: Best Red Carpet Fashion!\n\nThere's another reason that Dolly Parton will always love Brandi Cyrus and Miley Cyrus.\n\nAnd that's because the country superstar is actually related to the two, which Brandi was delighted to learn at the 2024 People's Choice Country Awards in Nashville Sept. 26. (Click here to see all the red carpet fashion.)\n\nThe 37-year-old, who sparkled in a short silver dress, pointed out that Dolly has always felt like family and that was only confirmed after learning her half-sister Miley is seventh cousins with Dolly—a connection that even the \"Jolene\" singer was thrilled by.\n\n\"She's Miley's godmother,\" Brandi exclusively told E! News cohost Keltie Knight on the red carpet, \"so I always say she's mine by association.\"\n\nThe musical families share a mutual great-grandfather named John Brickley, who lived in Blunt County, Tenn., in the early 1800s. And since they're now related, Brandi is already thinking about how she and her newfound cousin can work together.\n\n\"There should be a Brandi and Dolly collab,\" the DJ mused, \"maybe next year. That sounds right to me.\"\n\nAs for which iconic Dolly song she would love to remix? While she knows that \"Jolene\" would be a great choice, especially because \"Miley loves that song and she freakin' kills it,\" Brandi would prefer to do something that hadn't already been done so many times.\n\n\"I feel like we could do a sick '9 to 5' remix,\" she said, explaining that the key to a good remix is picking a song \"that people love and know, and that people are gonna sing along and dance to.\"\n\nSo Brandi is going to put that out into the universe, which is what she told E! she's been doing the past year, adding that she's been \"working hard and the payoff has been great.\"\n\n\"It's been a crazy year for me,\" she confessed. \"I kinda manifested this Wynn residency in Las Vegas. It's been my goal for a few years now that I've been doing this. I want the Vegas residency, I wanna be at the Wynn. So I've been doing that all year. It's been incredible.\"\n\nBrandi also had her debut release with a remix of Lainey Wilson's \"Wildflowers and Wild Horses,\" which she noted was \"another dream come true.\"\n\nBut more than that, Brandi shared that she's finally feeling like herself and comfortable in what she's doing as a DJ, joking that while people are surprised to learn about her new vocation, they realize how much it was meant for her when they see her in action.\n\nShe added, \"It feels like me.\"\n\nTo see more from the 2024 People's Choice Country Awards red carpet, keep reading.\n\n(E!, NBC and Peacock are all part of the NBCUniversal family.)",

They're actually related.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ancestry.com revealed that they're seventh cousins, once removed. According to the genealogy company, they share a mutual relative in John Brickey, who was born in Virginia in 1740 and lived in Blount County, Tennessee, until his death in 1806.\n\nThe news didn't come as too much of a shock to Dolly, who was presented with and asked about the information during an interview with Access Hollywood published on Monday. Dolly and her sister Rachel Parton George were speaking to the news outlet while promoting their new cookbook, Good Lookin' Cookin'.\n\n\"Now, who thought that up? Is that true?\" Dolly said as the reporter then revealed the shared ancestor. \"That's amazing,\" she continued. \"We're so close, Miley and I. I would've thought we'd at least been third cousins, 10 times removed.\"\n\nWhen asked about her thoughts on the relation, Dolly said, \"That's amazing, the ancestry that says I'm related to Miley, and I'm sure she'll get a kick out of that. But it doesn't surprise me because she does feel like family. I've always said she feels like a niece, or a child, or whatever, so that's a cool little thing.\"\n\nWatch Dolly's full reaction to the news below:",
      "# [Carl Dean, Dolly Parton’s husband of nearly 60 years who inspired ‘Jolene,’ dies at 82 by Maria Sherman, apnews.com, maria-sherman on 2025-03-04](https://apnews.com/article/dolly-parton-husband-carl-dean-dies-2b17ba0e44bcb864a3800bc17afdedeb)\nCarl Dean, Dolly Parton’s devoted husband of nearly 60 years who avoided the spotlight and inspired her timeless hit “Jolene,” died Monday. He was 82.\n\nAccording to a statement provided to The Associated Press by Parton’s publicist, Dean died in Nashville, Tennessee. He will be laid to rest in a private ceremony with immediate family attending.\n\n“Carl and I spent many wonderful years together. Words can’t do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years. Thank you for your prayers and sympathy,” Parton wrote in a statement.\n\nThe family has asked for respect and privacy. No cause of death was announced.\n\nParton met Dean outside the Wishy Washy Laundromat the day she moved to Nashville at 18.\n\n“I was surprised and delighted that while he talked to me, he looked at my face (a rare thing for me),” Parton described the meeting. “He seemed to be genuinely interested in finding out who I was and what I was about.”\n\nThey married two years later, on Memorial Day — May 30, 1966 — in a small ceremony in Ringgold, Georgia.\n\nDean was a businessman, having owned an asphalt-paving business in Nashville. His parents, Virginia “Ginny” Bates Dean and Edgar “Ed” Henry Dean, had three children. Parton referred to his mother as “Mama Dean.”\n\nDean is survived by Parton and his two siblings, Sandra and Donnie.\n\nHe inspired Parton’s classic, “Jolene.” Parton told NPR in 2008 that she wrote the song about a flirty bank teller who seemed to take an interest in Dean.\n\n“She got this terrible crush on my husband,” she said. “And he just loved going to the bank because she paid him so much attention. It was kinda like a running joke between us — when I was saying, ‘Hell, you’re spending a lot of time at the bank. I don’t believe we’ve got that kind of money.’ So it’s really an innocent song all around, but sounds like a dreadful one.”\n\nParton and Dean kept strict privacy around their relationship for decades, Parton telling The Associated Press in 1984: “A lot of people say there’s no Carl Dean, that he’s just somebody I made up to keep other people off me.”\n\nShe joked that she’d like to pose with him on the cover of a magazine “So that people could at least know that I’m not married to a wart or something.”\n\nIn 2023, Parton told AP Dean helped inspired her 2023 “Rockstar” album.\n\n“He’s a big rock and roller,” she said. The song “My Blue Tears,” which was written when Parton was with “The Porter Wagoner Show” in the late 1960s and early ’70s, is “one of my husband’s favorite songs that I ever wrote,” she said. “I thought, ’Well, I better put one of Carl’s favorites of mine in here.”",

      "# [Ancestry reveals Dolly Parton and Miley Cyrus are related. This was Dolly's reaction by Audrey Gibbs on 2024-09-24](https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2024/09/24/ancestry-reveals-dolly-parton-miley-cyrus-cousins/75364675007/)\nAncestry has uncovered that Dolly Parton is more than just Miley Cyrus' godmother. The genealogy company has discovered that the two are actually seventh cousins, once removed.\n\nBy using billions of historical records and its public family trees, Ancestry uncovered that Parton and Cyrus are related through a shared ancestor.\n\nTheir mutual great-grandfather, John Brickey, was born in Virginia in 1740 and moved to Blount County, Tenn. — only about 20 miles from Dollywood — where he stayed until his death in 1806. Brickey is Parton's sixth great- grandfather and Cyrus' seventh.\n\nParton learned that she was related to Cyrus in an interview with Access Hollywood. “Is that true? That’s amazing!\" Parton said.\n\n\"Well we're so close, Miley and I, I would've thought we'd been at least, you know, third cousins ... ten times removed! I’m sure [Miley] will get a kick out of that…it doesn’t surprise me because she does feel like family.”\n\nThe two singers have always had a deep connection. Parton has known Cyrus since before she was born, she said in a 2023 interview on SiriusXM’s “The Howard Stern Show.”\n\nParton became close with Cyrus' father, Billy Ray Cyrus, after touring together.\n\n“We just got to be good friends because he’s a Kentucky boy, I’m from Tennessee,” Parton said on the show. “And he said … ‘We’re having a girl, and you’ve got to be her godmother!’ And I said, ‘Well, I’d be honored.’ So actually, Miley and I took over from there. We just stayed very, very close through the years.”\n\n“Dolly’s been like a mother to me,\" Cyrus told W Magazine in June.\n\nParton has been a maternal figure to Cyrus, both on and off the screen. She played Aunt Dolly on \"Hannah Montana,\" first appearing on the show in 2006.\n\nThe two have also hit the stage together. Cyrus and Parton performed at a New Year's Eve party together last year, ringing in 2023 with a viral performance.\n\nThe news comes at an appropriate time, as Parton is gearing up to honor her family's roots with the release of her Nov. 15 album, \"Dolly Parton & Family: Smoky Mountain DNA – Family, Faith & Fables.\"\n\nThe album, a collaboration between Dollywood and Parton's co-owned Owepar Entertainment, will pay homage to Parton's family lineage, all the way from the U.K. to East Tennessee.\n\nA four-part docuseries, which will accompany the album, is also in production.\n\nAudrey Gibbs is a music journalist for The Tennessean.

      "# [Dolly Parton reacts to learning she and Miley Cyrus are actually related by Chrissy Callahan, AOL Staff on 2024-09-24](https://www.aol.com/news/dolly-parton-reacts-learning-she-235731397.html)\nMiley Cyrus has always shared a special bond with her godmother, Dolly Parton, but it turns out the duo is closer than they previously knew.\n\nA new Ancestry.com report reveals that Cyrus and Parton are distant relatives — 7th cousins once removed, to be precise.\n\nPublished this week on the Ancestry.com website, the report breaks down how the singers are related. As it turns out, they share a \"common ancestor from Tennessee\" named John Brickey, who was Parton’s 6th great-grandfather and Cyrus’ 7th great-grandfather.\n\nBorn in 1740 in Virginia, Brickey later relocated to Tennessee with his wife and children and stayed there until he died in 1806.\n\n“The Brickey family originated from France and the progenitor of the family came to the United States in the late 1600s,” the report reads.\n\nAncestry made the discovery by using the \"billions of historical records and public family trees\" in its records.\n\nIn an interview with Access Hollywood, Parton reacted to the revelation.\n\n\"Is that true? That's amazing,\" she said. \"We're so close, Miley and I. You would've though we would've been at least third cousins. I'm sure she'll get a kick out of that. It doesn't surprise me because she does feel like family.\"\n\nTODAY.com has reached out to Cyrus for comment.\n\nOver the years, Parton and Cyrus have spoken at length about their special relationship. In 2023, Cyrus told W Magazine that Parton has \"been like a mother\" to her and described a fax message the country icon sent her a few years ago on Mother's Day.\n\n“Dolly wrote to me to say: ‘How much do I love you? As much as my heart can hold and as far as my arms can reach,’” Cyrus said. “It gets me choked up. I just love her so much.”\n\nIn a tribute to Parton after she was named to Time magazine's 100 most influential people of 2021, Cyrus described Parton as her \"idol because of her incomparable career\" and her \"role model because of her steadfast morals and values.”\n\nWhen Cyrus was starring on \"Hannah Montana,\" her godmother made a few guest appearances on the show and played her aunt.\n\n“I remember when she came in to do a table read for Hannah Montana in all her bedazzled glory,” Cyrus wrote in an essay for Time. “Her smell, the way her nails tapped the table, the sound it made when she flipped the pages of the script—I could see that she fascinated other people too. A living fantasy was in front of all of us.”\n\nThe singers also teamed up for a TV special called “Miley’s New Year’s Eve Party” in 2022. At the time, Cyrus spoke to TODAY about their bond.\n\n“People are going to be affected by the show. There’s a chemistry, and a realness, and a love, and a connection that her and I have that I really feel,” she said.",
      "# [What Would Dolly Do: Tackling Early Childhood Literacy in Charlotte on 2025-02-06](https://www.davidson.edu/news/2025/02/06/what-would-dolly-do-tackling-early-childhood-literacy-charlotte)\n\"What Would Dolly Do?\" is a commonly referenced quote in the Smart Start of Mecklenburg County (SSMC) office, an early childhood focused nonprofit in Charlotte.\n\nWhile a connection between Dolly and early childhood might seem incredibly distant, they are more closely related than you imagine. Dolly Parton funds an international book distribution system called Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library (DPIL). The premise of this program is that children ages 0-5 in areas covered by the program can sign up to receive one developmentally appropriate book a month until they turn five years old, free of charge. Many studies have shown that the more books a young child has around them, the quicker and higher their literacy skills grow when they are older.\n\nIn Mecklenburg County, this program sends out 31,000 books monthly and is run through SSMC by one woman, Alyssa Wood. This summer, I had the opportunity to intern with Alyssa through Davidson’s Nonprofit Leadership Fellows. During my internship, I have been introduced to a million different people, projects, acronyms and experiences.\n\nMy day-to-day tasks include answering emails from parents whose children are enrolled in DPIL, maintaining the DPIL database, attending meetings with various staff to gain a full understanding of the organization, driving books to DPIL-run “Little Libraries” around the county, and chatting with my coworkers when we need breaks!\n\nAside from my day-to-day adventures, I have also been tirelessly working on a project dreamed up by my supervisor. This project sought to determine areas in Mecklenburg County considered “book deserts” – meaning areas that have few literacy resources (including access to books and workshops to teach parents how to aid interactions between children and books effectively). To determine these areas, I spent many days scanning through census records, demographic databases and data shared by early literacy groups we partner with (including the CMC Public Libraries, Raising a Reader, and Reach Out and Read). From this data analysis, I was able to identify the most underserved communities, as well as those more specifically with limited access to early literacy resources.\n\nOnce we compiled and summarized the data, my supervisor and I presented our findings to other early literacy organizations working in the county so as to create a space for discussion and recommendations on what we can all do moving forward to reach the underserved areas. Overall, this was a great experience that exposed me to new knowledge and people who will continue to be a part of my life even when the summer is over.",
      "# [Carl Dean, Dolly Parton's husband of nearly 60 years who inspired 'Jolene,' dies at 82 by MARIA SHERMAN on 2025-03-04](https://www.yahoo.com/news/carl-dean-dolly-partons-husband-001724585.html)\nCarl Dean, Dolly Parton's devoted husband of nearly 60 years who avoided the spotlight and inspired her timeless hit “Jolene,” died Monday. He was 82.\n\nAccording to a statement provided to The Associated Press by Parton's publicist, Dean died in Nashville, Tennessee. He will be laid to rest in a private ceremony with immediate family attending.\n\n“Carl and I spent many wonderful years together. Words can't do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years. Thank you for your prayers and sympathy,\" Parton wrote in a statement.\n\nThe family has asked for respect and privacy. No cause of death was announced.\n\nParton met Dean outside the Wishy Washy Laundromat the day she moved to Nashville at 18.\n\n“I was surprised and delighted that while he talked to me, he looked at my face (a rare thing for me),\" Parton described the meeting. \"He seemed to be genuinely interested in finding out who I was and what I was about.”\n\nThey married two years later, on Memorial Day — May 30, 1966 — in a small ceremony in Ringgold, Georgia.\n\nDean was a businessman, having owned an asphalt-paving business in Nashville. His parents, Virginia “Ginny” Bates Dean and Edgar “Ed” Henry Dean, had three children. Parton referred to his mother as “Mama Dean.”\n\nDean is survived by Parton and his two siblings, Sandra and Donnie.\n\nHe inspired Parton’s classic, “Jolene.” Parton told NPR in 2008 that she wrote the song about a flirty bank teller who seemed to take an interest in Dean.\n\n“She got this terrible crush on my husband,” she said. “And he just loved going to the bank because she paid him so much attention. It was kinda like a running joke between us — when I was saying, ‘Hell, you’re spending a lot of time at the bank. I don’t believe we’ve got that kind of money.’ So it’s really an innocent song all around, but sounds like a dreadful one.”\n\nParton and Dean kept strict privacy around their relationship for decades, Parton telling The Associated Press in 1984: “A lot of people say there’s no Carl Dean, that he’s just somebody I made up to keep other people off me.”\n\nShe joked that she’d like to pose with him on the cover of a magazine “So that people could at least know that I’m not married to a wart or something.”\n\nIn 2023, Parton told AP Dean helped inspired her 2023 “Rockstar” album.\n\n“He’s a big rock and roller,” she said. The song “My Blue Tears,” which was written when Parton was with “The Porter Wagoner Show” in the late 1960s and early ’70s, is “one of my husband’s favorite songs that I ever wrote,” she said. “I thought, ’Well, I better put one of Carl’s favorites of mine in here.”",

People loved it. Because he was a Southern boy.\"\n\nPetty's daughter, Adria, visited the set during Parton's video shoot for \"Southern Accents,\" bringing along her daughter Everly. The video features Petty's home movies and heirlooms, making it a deeply personal tribute that helped connect Parton to the moment.\n\n\"I just sang my song and I could feel and see all those things around me and all the artifacts that they had there, his guitar, his clothes,\" said Parton. \"And I just thought, 'Well, I hope he'd be proud of this.'\"\n\nStar-studded cast of country artists\n\nThe album features an impressive lineup of country music's biggest stars, including Dierks Bentley, Luke Combs, Wynonna Judd, Lainey Wilson, George Strait and Willie Nelson. Chris Stapleton said he was greatly influenced by Petty's \"Wildflowers\" album.\n\n\"Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers is an influence on every country act that has existed since they were a band,\" said Stapleton. \"There were no skips, you know. It's kind of my barometer for: this is the goal.\"\n\nHe chose to cover \"I Should Have Known It\" from Petty and the Heartbreakers' \"Mojo\" album and said it was quite a lot to learn.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, shortly before Petty's passing, Stapleton had the opportunity to meet and open for him. It was during this event at Wrigley Field that Stapleton first met Heartbreakers guitarist Mike Campbell.\n\n\"We had to traipse through their dressing room to get to the stage … [Mike] was looking for a shirt or something,\" Stapleton said, laughing.\n\nCampbell found it ironic that they met this way, given that years later, with Stapleton's band headlining at Wrigley Field, he invited Campbell to open for them—a perfect fit for the two.\n\n\"It's beautifully poetic,\" said Campbell.\n\nCampbell on tribute to his \"brother\"\n\nPetty and the Heartbreakers emerged from Gainesville, Florida, bringing their country influences with them.\n\n\"There's country strains in our DNA,\" Campbell said. \"The country music that influenced me and Tom was George Jones, Loretta Lynn, and Dolly Parton.\"\n\nCampbell also performs on \"Petty Country\" with Margo Price, covering the song \"Ways to Be Wicked,\" which he co-wrote.\n\n\"I'm really proud of the song legacy. That's why I'm glad they did the country album. It reminds people that, hey, Tom was a great writer,\" said Campbell.\n\nHe admitted to missing Petty deeply, reflecting on their close relationship and the numerous songs they wrote together. Performing these songs now brings a mix of joy and bittersweet emotions for Campbell, who said he sometimes gets choked up while singing the lyrics, feeling Petty's presence.\n\n\"I love my brother. And he's always with me, you know,\" said Campbell.\n\nThe album \"Petty Country\" serves as a healing tribute for both the artists and the fans.\n\n\"It's emotional but it's good,\" Campbell said. \"For the crowd too, I think.

      "# [Then & Now — Skydog Ranch & Sanctuary](https://www.skydogranch.org/dolly-then-now)\nAs temperatures were breaking heat records across the country, and the lethal wild horse and burro roundups raged in Wyoming, we dedicated ourselves to saving some more beautiful souls. While arranging a haul for a mustang, Hank, from Oklahoma, I went on the kill pen page to see who else we could help. I found Dolly, a hugely pregnant jenny, and her jack companion, Domino. We thought at first that he might be the father, but when we received the paperwork, we saw they came from different places. Biological father or not, we got them out of there as quickly as possible to avoid any further exposure to infections that run rampant in kill pens and are often fatal for donkeys, especially babies.\n\nThey were in the best of hands with our wonderful hauler, Steve. He drove them through the night to keep them cool and avoid the crazy 4th of July traffic. We chose our previous ranch in Malibu for their quarantine as there are no longer any other equines in residence. Once there, they received veterinary attention. Dolly finished her pregnancy in the peace of a Malibu summer, where the marine layer and ocean breezes keep the temperatures mercifully cool until afternoon.\n\nWe were able to put a halter on Dolly while she was inside the trailer, but it took a while to coax her out. These things take time and patience, of which we have plenty when it's for their good. Donkeys are extremely cautious and sensitive. They stop in their tracks to assess an unfamiliar situation. Their intelligence and instincts for self-preservation are often misread as stupidity and obstinacy, resulting in mistreatment. At Skydog, we respect them as the sentient beings they are with feelings, emotions, friends, families, and fears. We don’t rush them into making decisions. They are surrounded with love, only love, from now on.\n\nDolly may have been hesitant about getting off the trailer, but she wasted no time diving into the good food in her bin. When I placed my hands on her, I was shocked by how thin and bony she was; emaciated aside from the big baby she was carrying. Her coarse and rough coat were another indication that she’d not been getting any nutrition. l worried for the baby, but I knew getting them here quickly to the best medical care was the greatest chance they had.\n\nDolly quite obviously looked as if she was about to give birth as the baby was hanging very low. We hoped for some time before delivery to build her up so she could produce the all-important colostrum for nursing. It’s all about good food, vitamins and minerals for the health of the mother and foal. Knowing the clock was ticking, we were super focused on making sure Dolly was relaxed and getting plenty of everything she needed. It was wonderful to see just a couple days later that she and Domino were rolling in their pen.\n\nDuring the night between July 15-16, 2024, Dolly gave birth a beautiful baby girl. What a joy it was to find Pepper, her all-black foal, resting in the soft, clean bedding of her stall. She was up in no time on wobbly legs and successfully latched onto her mother. We could see she was nursing, but sometimes skinny, starved mothers can’t produce the protective antibodies, so their milk is just milk. To be absolutely sure Pepper was getting the colostrum she needed, the vet, Dr. Merle, did a blood test and confirmed all was well!\n\nAll mothers are different and Dolly wants her privacy. We had to watch them closely in the delicate, early days, but we kept a respectful distance for Dolly’s comfort. At first, she wouldn’t nurse while humans were around, but when they were alone in their stall, she allowed her foal to drink all she wanted. Thankfully, Pepper has been very healthy all along and we have not had to intervene. Today, Mom approvingly nudges little Pepper over to us for scratches and cuddles, though she herself will only approach for cookies. Soon, they will move to the other ranch where our Malibu volunteers will work their magic and Dolly will learn how kind and loving people can be.\n\n#skydogdolly\n\nAmerican Mustangs and Burros Need Your Help!\n\nIn addition to supporting our work by donating, becoming a patron on Patreon, or sponsoring a Skydog, there are several important pieces of legislation to protect American equines currently moving through Congress. It only takes a few minutes to contact your Rep and Senators and urge them to support these bills:\n\nSave America’s Forgotten Equines (SAFE) Act of 2025 (H.R.1661 in the House and S.775 in the Senate). This bill would amend the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018. Commonly known as the “Farm Bill”, this omnibus federal law includes several important provisions for animals. Among them, the Cat and Dog Meat Trade Prohibition Act, which makes it illegal to slaughter, transport, possess, purchase, sell, or donate dogs and cats, or their parts, for human consumption. This SAFE Act would extend the prohibition to equines. Specifically, prohibiting a person from knowingly slaughtering an American equine for human consumption; or shipping, transporting, possessing, purchasing, selling, or donating an American equine to be slaughtered for human consumption. This bill will shut down the slaughter pipeline that sends some 20,000 American horses and donkeys to savagely monstrous deaths in foreign slaughterhouses every year.\n\nYou can Contact Members of Congress by calling the Capitol Switchboard (202) 224-3121‬, submitting contact forms on their individual websites, or sending one email to all three simultaneously at www.democracy.io\n\nSee our How to Help menu for other actions to ban zebra hunting at US canned hunt ranches, stop production of Premarin & other PMU drugs, and defund the Adoption Incentive Program.\n\nYou can also tell your Rep and Senators that you want these bills from the previous Congress introduced again this session:\n\nThe Wild Horse & Burro Protection Act of 2023 (H. R. 3656) This bill will prohibit the use of helicopters or fixed-wing aircraft in the management of wild mustangs and burros on public lands, and require a report on humane alternatives to current management practices.\n\nEjiao Act of 2023 (H.R. 6021). To ​​ban the sale or transportation of ejiao, a gelatin made from boiling donkey skins, or products containing ejiao in interstate or foreign commerce, which brutally kills millions of donkeys primarily for beauty products and Chinese medicine."
