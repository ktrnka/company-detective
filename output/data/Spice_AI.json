Our mission is to make creating intelligent applications as easy as building a modern website.\n\nHere’s a quick demo of going from zero to downloading & installing Spice.ai, training and getting a recommendation in less than 60 seconds: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPPGyPq41kQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPPGyPq41kQ)\n\nWe’re looking for feedback on the direction. It’s not finished, in fact, we only started this summer, and we invite you to try out the alpha: [https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai)\n\nYou can read the background story at [https://blog.spiceai.org](https://blog.spiceai.org/)\n\nLooking forward to your feedback and we hope you join us in the mission!\n\n## Comment ID hbz2p89 with +1 score by [(scraper01, Reddit, 2021-09-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/pjufdr/introducing_spiceai_open_source_time_series_ai/hbz2p89/) (in reply to ID pjufdr):\nThis is a cool concept.

We currently only support two, [Vanilla Policy Gradient](https://docs.spiceai.org/deep-learning-ai/vpg/) and [Deep Q-Learning](https://docs.spiceai.org/deep-learning-ai/dql/), however we'll be adding more going forward, including Actor Critic algorithms in v0.2.0-alpha.\n\nYou can learn more at [docs.spiceai.org/deep-learning-ai](https://docs.spiceai.org/deep-learning-ai/)\n\n#### Comment ID hbzlcnl with +2 score by [(scraper01, Reddit, 2021-09-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/pjufdr/introducing_spiceai_open_source_time_series_ai/hbzlcnl/) (in reply to ID hbz382u):\nNice.\n\n## Comment ID hc02wrs with +1 score by [(sharky6000, Reddit, 2021-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/pjufdr/introducing_spiceai_open_source_time_series_ai/hc02wrs/) (in reply to ID pjufdr):\nSeems neat! I love that your install is an invocation of curl piping into bash. The geek in me is like <3 but also one line install is quite nice for everyone.\n\nI like the idea, but not sure I fully get it. As an expert in RL, I am having trouble understanding what is under the hood after a read through your blog page. Is it that the users specify the RL environment, allowable actions, observations, rewards, etc. depending on their application/use case and spice runs online Deep RL as their app streams data to it?\n\nIf so, can you say more about how users describe the RL environments (and communication protocols, I guess?) in a way that spice can understand them? Do they use go/python or a higher-level language/format/GUI?\n\n### Comment ID hc04wp3 with +1 score by [(Haardvark5000, Reddit, 2021-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/pjufdr/introducing_spiceai_open_source_time_series_ai/hc04wp3/) (in reply to ID hc02wrs):\nYou're dead on with your explanation.\n\nRight now we're using what we're calling a [pod manifest](https://docs.spiceai.org/reference/pod/) to describe environments.  These manifests are YAML with inlined Python reward functions.  Dialing in their structure to make them as useful as possible is definitely something we're looking for help with.  We'd love to get feedback from an RL expert :)\n\n#### Comment ID hc07u7o with +4 score by [(sharky6000, Reddit, 2021-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/pjufdr/introducing_spiceai_open_source_time_series_ai/hc07u7o/) (in reply to ID hc04wp3):\nCool, thanks. Makes sense.\n\nI will maybe write more tomorrow when I am not on a phone. But here is a quick comment.\n\nDeep RL is known to be notoriously sample-inefficent, especially with raw input representations and no specific type of network architectures. Atari benefited originally from CNNs (and Atari-specific input encodings.. such as downsampling and frame stacking) and AlphaZero from ResNets. It might be important to allow users to do this kind of feature encodings client-side since they know their app and can decide how to pre-filer the inputs or what architectures might work best on their data.\n\nI would be quite amazed to see Deep RL working \"in the real world\" like this, please do share any success stories!  :)\n\n## Comment ID hc0vkun with +1 score by [(dogs_like_me, Reddit, 2021-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/pjufdr/introducing_spiceai_open_source_time_series_ai/hc0vkun/) (in reply to ID pjufdr):\nyour docs need to make clear what this is and why I want to use it right at the top. I've scanned past installation and I still don't know what this is. Clear statement at the top of what it is, followed by a minimal usage demo. Then move on to explaining features, navigating the library, and outlining installation. I feel like I keep reading \"also\" but I don't know what that's in addition to.\n\nEDIT: After poking around your company bios a bit, I think it's a little sus that your bio makes it sound like you basically invented DAPR, but github shows you only ever made two commits to it and both were CI pipeline stuff, i.e. not even commits to the main source. \n\nAlso, you have a lot of links to spice.ai but that just links back to github. I think you meant those links to be spiceai.io. Or maybe you meant to update what spice.ai redirects to and forgot?\n\n### Comment ID hc18jl0 with +1 score by [(SpiceLuke, Reddit, 2021-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/pjufdr/introducing_spiceai_open_source_time_series_ai/hc18jl0/) (in reply to ID hc0vkun):\nHey, awesome feedback, thank you! Thanks for taking the time to write it up. Yes we need to do a much better job of making it clear what it is and why you should use it.\n\nOn Dapr - I built and lead the incubator in the Azure Office of the CTO that developed and built Dapr, so I did less coding and more team building (we went from 2 people to about 15 in a year or so). We also made other projects, like [https://oam.dev](https://oam.dev), and some others that haven't been released yet. Was a very cool team.\n\nWe plan to put up a project page at [spiceai.org](https://spiceai.org) but have really been focused on the GitHub project, so we haven't launched that yet. Once it launches, it won't just redirect.",
      "# Post ID 1gufjpf: Is Ice Spice the worst addition to the season?  with +4645 score by [(JUNIDJND, Reddit, 2024-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1gufjpf/is_ice_spice_the_worst_addition_to_the_season/)\nUnlike Snoop Dogg or Eminem, I haven't seen anyone get excited about Ice Spice, and when she came, We were presented with not one, but the worst bot of all, sabotaging more than helping. Also, in my personal opinion, I don't like her cosmetics, her emotes would be worse next to Lady Gaga, maybe, that's already a personal opinion and everyone thinks differently. \n\nBut what do they say? Would Fortnite Chapter 2: Remix be better without Ice Spice?

Same thing happened during the Metallica season - just not my thing.  I get that not every skin is \"for me\".  \n\nEpic has millions of people they are trying to please and there's no way they can check everyone's boxes.  People seem to expect all of the BP/Shop skins to cater to their personal tastes.  It's not possible.\n\nThere's also the bigger issue of $$$ that was probably at play this season.  Epic likely had a specific budget - most of which went to Snoop as the headliner; I imagine Eminem is not cheap; and they've probably had their eye on Juice WRLD for awhile.  I'd assume they were hoping to include a female rapper as their 4th; but had a limited portion of the budget left after getting those first 3 performers - so that probably meant big names like Doja Cat, Nicki Minaj, Megan Thee Stallion & Cardi B were too expensive.  They have an existing relationship with Ice Spice; and you have to keep in mind they chart these contracts a year out - in 2023 she was charting big and getting a bunch of music noms.\n\nAnyway...it isn't for you & it isn't for me - but I have a squadmate rocking both the skins.  And its made her super happy.  Thats what counts, right?\n\n### Comment ID lxu5pxp with +281 score by [(Conscious-Power-5754, Reddit, 2024-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1gufjpf/is_ice_spice_the_worst_addition_to_the_season/lxu5pxp/) (in reply to ID lxtxs4l):\nThis perspective is a breath of fresh air here, thanks man!\n\n### Comment ID lxu7277 with +171 score by [(Dootdootdootdootd00, Reddit, 2024-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1gufjpf/is_ice_spice_the_worst_addition_to_the_season/lxu7277/) (in reply to ID lxtxs4l):\nThank God someone has a brain\n\n#### Comment ID lxu8h44 with +57 score by [(ABAgamer, Reddit, 2024-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1gufjpf/is_ice_spice_the_worst_addition_to_the_season/lxu8h44/) (in reply to ID lxu7277):\nThat’s what I’m saying!

I would rather have The Shark and Skye back than Ice Spice. I would much rather it be someone like Michael Jackson or Steven Tyler of Aerosmith but that probably won't happen. It's not that I hate Ice Spice, it's just that no one asked for her to be in the game.\n\n### Comment ID lxua8es with +3 score by [(Strange_Dog6483, Reddit, 2024-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1gufjpf/is_ice_spice_the_worst_addition_to_the_season/lxua8es/) (in reply to ID lxu5hqi):\nNo one has to ask for anything to be in the game, For them to put it in the game.\n\nThey could just do it……especially if they have the money to do so.\n\n## Comment ID lxtqoyv with +4 score by [(SkullMan140, Reddit, 2024-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1gufjpf/is_ice_spice_the_worst_addition_to_the_season/lxtqoyv/) (in reply to ID 1gufjpf):\nNah, she was just okay\n\n## Comment ID lxu3myl with +2 score by [(Connect_Captain_2696, Reddit, 2024-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1gufjpf/is_ice_spice_the_worst_addition_to_the_season/lxu3myl/) (in reply to ID 1gufjpf):\nNo\n\n## Comment ID lxu5c78 with +2 score by [(Brunoaraujoespin, Reddit, 2024-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1gufjpf/is_ice_spice_the_worst_addition_to_the_season/lxu5c78/) (in reply to ID 1gufjpf):\nSo many people bought\n\n## Comment ID lxu6l6h with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1gufjpf/is_ice_spice_the_worst_addition_to_the_season/lxu6l6h/) (in reply to ID 1gufjpf):\nI don't get it with you weirdo ls complaining about a character that you don't have to buy\n\n\nBut the AI is terrible this season\n\n## Comment ID lxuabzo with +2 score by [(Water_In_A_Cup1, Reddit, 2024-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1gufjpf/is_ice_spice_the_worst_addition_to_the_season/lxuabzo/) (in reply to ID 1gufjpf):\nCringe post\n\n## Comment ID lxucxeq with +2 score by [(Spaketchi, Reddit, 2024-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1gufjpf/is_ice_spice_the_worst_addition_to_the_season/lxucxeq/) (in reply to ID 1gufjpf):\nShe's a cute skin and lots of people are running her.

We don’t ever hire her. We get snoop and Eminem (sometimes together! I play with my 23 year old daughter and her bf and my 7 year old daughter). Snoop always throws stink bombs in our face and we can’t see. And we will order him to res and he will run up to the player and then run away. Eminem will res but he spends all day just throwing grenades and making me antsy. Meowdas usually does a good job of splashing us. None of them really do a good job when we’re trying to lay low.

Dune's space travel, even by warp, is weighed down by exploitative costs, but navigation is fairly adequate so it's more akin to classical nautical travel. Back in the day transporting armies was incredibly expensive, and doubly so when needing to do it by water.\n\nHowever, 40K presents danger in the unpredictable nature of warp travel. There way of warp is powered by what is esentially the personification of entropic universal forces. You're using waves and tides of a psychic pool that, in the time of 40K, is incredibly tumultuous because of the power accrued by those entropic forces, the Chaos Gods. It's essentially traveling in hostile waters with a massive storm raging every time you want to warp travel, and it used to be ecen worse. In fact they even call it the Warp Storm in canon.\n\n#### Comment ID i8te28q with +23 score by [(Billbert-Billboard, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dune/comments/uqu3pk/dune_is_different_than_star_wars_or_warhammer_40k/i8te28q/) (in reply to ID i8t92tv):\nAdding to this, I always viewed Warp Travel as attempting to swim in the sea during a storm, with the sea actively attempting to kill you, as if with a mind of its own (because the Pantheon is so ubiquitous in there).

Imagine a period of 5000 years where guild navigators became useless, died trying, or they died trying *and* doomed their solar system by materializing space demons. That's what the Age of Strife was in the 40k universe. And even after space travel was possible again thousands of daily human psyker sacrifices are required to create a beacon akin to a lighthouse in order to even attempt navigating the warp. I don't think any other universe has a more dangerous or costly method of space travel. \n\nThe main difference between space travel in Dune and other universes is one faction having a monopoly over it and being able to create \"false scarcity.\"\n\n## Comment ID i8te26o with +43 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dune/comments/uqu3pk/dune_is_different_than_star_wars_or_warhammer_40k/i8te26o/) (in reply to ID uqu3pk):\n> and expensive\n\nStar Wars and Warhammer are about about adventure.

They are an homage to the Flashman Papers so it's starting with a fun premise. (Cain is toned down substantially from Flashman, morally speaking, in case that's a concern.)\n\nThe books are easy and quick reads, often funny, and introduce you to the lore from all three important perspectives. You get what the grunts know (much of which is untrue), you get what the leadership knows, (Cain is part of the Commisariat, and also rubs elbows with Lords General), and the books are \"edited\" via clarifying footnotes by an Imperial Inquisitor. She knows *everything.*\n\nThere are more than a dozen of the books. If you binge them you'll find they become a little one note, but I enjoyed every single one and would intersperse them with other reading.\n\nAnother good in, if you want something a little more serious, is the Gaunt's Ghosts series. There's a billion of them, they're well written, and they cover endless war from an Imperial Guard perspective well. I found Cain to be more fun.\n\nLastly, you have to address the elephant in the room: Eisenhorn.\n\nThe Eisenhorn (and in my opinion the Pariah follow-up) canon is incredible. They are not as fun of a read as Cain, and Abnett has trouble with giving satisfying endings in the individual books, but the overall arc of Eisenhorn is top notch, and I'm really excited to see where it goes with Pariah.\n\nSo what are you in the mood for?\n\nCain - Fun and unwanted adventure told by a scoundrel.\n\nGaunt's Ghosts - Band of Brothers 40K\n\nEisenhorn - Grimdark spy thriller.\n\n## Comment ID i8tc03m with +15 score by [(allthecoffeesDP, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dune/comments/uqu3pk/dune_is_different_than_star_wars_or_warhammer_40k/i8tc03m/) (in reply to ID uqu3pk):\n>This will make the movies very intriguing\n\nYou know there's a book series right? 😆\n\n## Comment ID i8teqsf with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dune/comments/uqu3pk/dune_is_different_than_star_wars_or_warhammer_40k/i8teqsf/) (in reply to ID uqu3pk):\nWhy didn’t it cost the Atreides the same to move their forces there when they took Arrakis over?

Access to technology is limited for everyone.\n* Star Wars - people are fighting against the system (people vs. government) and access to technology is plentiful.\n* Warhammer 40k - different systems fighting each other, using all their resources without care for the cost (the factions fighting each other). Access to technology is only granted to those fighting for the systems, regular people have limited access. \n\nThis fits in with the ease in which space travel can be done in each series:\n\n* Dune  - requires special ships/engines and navigators. There are no available alternatives (until much latter in the series) so you have to play by the rules of the Guild.\n* Star Wars - all you need is the right type of engine and coordinates, and both are relatively easy to get ahold of for regular travel by people, allowing possible independence from a central controlling force.\n* Warhammer 40k - requires special ships/engines and navigators, or else access to special/hard to reach places (webway). Other options may be available, but they are highly regulated or in limited supply/access. All this means that people need to work with the existing powers to be able to travel, and as such end up fighting for said powers.\n\n## Comment ID i8uhwck with +2 score by [(KetchupGore, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dune/comments/uqu3pk/dune_is_different_than_star_wars_or_warhammer_40k/i8uhwck/) (in reply to ID uqu3pk):\ngoing through the warp storms aint no sunday walk aswell lol\n\n## Comment ID i8uum05 with +2 score by [(Kreuscher, Reddit, 2022-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dune/comments/uqu3pk/dune_is_different_than_star_wars_or_warhammer_40k/i8uum05/) (in reply to ID uqu3pk):\nSpace travel isn't economically costly in Warhammer 40k, yet the risks are real and very high, ultimately severely affecting the logistics of the Imperium.

They need a mutant or a psycher to guide them through essentially a hellish abyss populated by beings spawned from the negative acts and ambitions of the real space world.

Ships being lost in the warp is very common and them getting shit back out after being mutated, twisted, welded together with other ships and filled with all many of nasty things like tyranids is common thats what Space Hulks are. Without the guiding light of the emperor warp navigation is near impossible for the imperium. Even with a navigator and a gellar field and the astronimican ships will still get lost.

And i am not talking about those ads of people selling you get rich quick courses, which i get to see way too often as well, i am talking about deep fake Elon Musk saying that he has built an AI powered trading bot that will allow you to make 1 million dollars in 6 months risk free and to be honest i can't tell that it is deep fake, it looks very real. Here is the link to the ad: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWGb0BLYBOs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWGb0BLYBOs)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z7zagtomju5c1.png?width=1942&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ed808fbf9800784a6bb1698fac2317d8e5f2a85\n\nor here another one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE77YkmsbDc&t=75s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE77YkmsbDc&t=75s) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am from Austria so i get to see the German version of these scams as well.

So the fact that the scammers are able to afford these ads means that people keep falling for these scams, and YouTube doesn't seem to care at all.  \n\nAnd i don't want to use an adblocker because i want the people i watch to get paid for their work, but i don't want them to be paid with the money from the victims of these scams. \n\nIs this a regional problem in Austria or do you see these scams too? \n\n## Comment ID kd1bb0c with +95 score by [(King_Bongo_Bong, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/18gjiqy/youtube_doesnt_want_to_take_down_scam_ads/kd1bb0c/) (in reply to ID 18gjiqy):\nI’ve observed the same.

Lots of flash games that gave you viruses and awful hoax stuff like the human dog hybrid thing. It wasn't until 2010-2012 when the ads started becoming actually bearable. Car ads, movie trailers (that varied in quality but were still trailers nonetheless), music, etc. It wasn't perfect. There were a few hiccups, like the fact that you got a lot of pro religious ads on antitheist channels. But it was a system that worked.\n\nNow, it feels like Google is taking us back to the era of shitty ads, except worse.\n\nEdit: I would also like to point out that the spam bots have gone absolutely wild. Last night, I saw a whole ass thread of bots speaking to each other about a passive income scam...on a video about the lady who has to flee Texas to get an abortion on a nonviable pregnancy.

Usually.\n\nIt's almost like there are no normal ads \n\nLike I haven't even seen a manscaped ad.  Or you know something I can actually see people getting some kind of utility from. \n\nI'm trying to make light of a f Ed up situation but if they want people to pay to get ads off they should show that there actual quality control is up to snuff.\n\nEven if ads get taken down YouTubers put ads in there videos as sponsors ads anyways. So I am not sure where they get the idea that paying would make it any less ad free. And you can't skip in video sponcership ad with one click you have to fiddle with it to skip it.\n\n## Comment ID kh7ogq0 with +1 score by [(killsiix, Reddit, 2024-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/18gjiqy/youtube_doesnt_want_to_take_down_scam_ads/kh7ogq0/) (in reply to ID 18gjiqy):\nRemember to sign up for your free 6400$ health subsidy everyone 😂\n\n## Comment ID khhjq6l with +1 score by [(BunaPasitaiko, Reddit, 2024-01-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/18gjiqy/youtube_doesnt_want_to_take_down_scam_ads/khhjq6l/) (in reply to ID 18gjiqy):\nYesterday I reported two ads of \"same product\", but link was different and pretended as local news website.

Its chief rule prohibits the use of atomic weapons against human targets. Each rule of the Great Convention begins: \"The forms must be obeyed . . . \"\n\n>JIHAD, BUTLERIAN: (see also Great Revolt) -- the crusade against computers, thinking machines, and conscious robots begun in 201 B.G. and concluded in 108 B.G. Its chief commandment remains in the O.C. Bible as \"Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.\"\n\nThe Butlerian Jihad left a strong mark on humanity's memory, and was subsequently made a primary doctrine of the new religion that blossomed in it's wake. Some of these beliefs would have been codified into law by the Landsraad.\n\nAdditionally, the definitions for Assassin's Handbook, Tupile, and War of Assassins mention the term \"Guild Peace.\" This is referencing the Spacing Guild, and the strictures they enact in exchange for interstellar transportation privileges.

Once you do that, you can theoretically flaunt any kind of law and start dominating everyone else. \n\nThe spacing guild don't need AI, and they're addicted to spice so hard that changing how they do things would kill them, and even if they want to do a multi-generation project to wean themselves off of spice, AI is far more easier for other people to steal than a guild navigator and start your own breeding program. \n\nYou wouldn't just need to develop AI, you would need to develop ships. Going from nothing to computers capable of piloting a ship would be a multi-generation project. If you are caught doing that at any point, your access to spice and space travel is cut off at the very least. Building the ships would also be very hard. With the amount of spies and truthsayers etc running around, you don't want to be doing something that dangerous for how long it would take. You're starting a project that can get your whole faction destroyed at any minute so that one of your descendants can make a huge power play. \n\nIf the Emperor tried it, everyone would rebel against him. If one of the houses did it, everyone would gang up on them. This isn't because of religious or cultural reasons (although they are present) but because no one wants to be at a gigantic disadvantage. No one really likes the spacing guild having a monopoly, but it's balanced enough that the situation can be endured.\n\nTrying to develop AI for any other reason would result in the same outcomes for you, except you don't really have an exit if you get cut off.\n\nThe only way to go about it would be to cultivate your own kind of dependency. Everyone gets sused out that Ix is pushing the boundaries, but they need what Ix has to sell them, because if other people ignore it and buy their tech then you're at a disadvantage. Over the years they can continue to advance under everyone's noses and people just kind of allow it.\n\nThere's always a materialist basis to the shit that goes on in Dune.

Why? How is it justified?\n\n\nI don’t work in a coffee shop but the answer you’ll probably get is you have to stock more milks, you have to potentially wash things more for allergies/contamination with multiple milks, you have to train baristas on more drinks/techniques, you may have to spend more time steaming plant milk vs dairy milk, may need to buy more fridges….. \n\nand all these excuses are not going to really add up to the up charge costs, especially when plant based milks are probably more popular in many LA coffee shops than dairy.

      "# [Announcing Spice.ai Open Source 1.0-stable: A Portable Compute Engine for Data-Grounded AI — Now Ready for Production by Luke Kim, x.com on 2025-01-22](https://spiceai.org/blog/announcing-1.0-stable)\n🎉 Today marks the 1.0-stable release of Spice.ai Open Source—purpose-built to help enterprises ground AI in data. By unifying federated data query, retrieval, and AI inference into a single engine, Spice mitigates AI hallucinations, accelerates data access for mission-critical workloads, and makes it simple and easy for developers to build fast and accurate data-intensive applications across cloud, edge, or on-prem.\n\nEnterprise AI systems are only as good as the context they’re provided. When data is inaccessible, incomplete, or outdated, even the most advanced models can generate outputs that are inaccurate, misleading, or worse, potentially harmful. In one example, a chatbot was tricked into selling a 2024 Chevy Tahoe for $1 due to a lack of contextual safeguards. For enterprises, errors like these are unacceptable—it’s the difference between success and failure.\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is part of the answer — but traditional RAG is only as good as the data it has access to. If data is locked away in disparate, often legacy data systems, or cannot be stitched together for accurate retrieval, you get, as Benioff puts it, \"Clippy 2.0\".\n\nAnd often, after initial Python-scripted pilots, you’re left with a new set of problems: How do you deploy AI that meets enterprise requirements for performance, security, and compliance while being cost efficient? Directly querying large datasets for retrieval is slow and expensive. Building and maintaining complex ETL pipelines requires expensive data teams that most organizations don’t have. And because enterprise data is highly sensitive, you need secure access and auditable observability—something many RAG setups don’t even consider.\n\nDevelopers need a platform at the intersection of data and AI—one specifically designed to ground AI in data. A solution that unifies data query, search, retrieval, and model inference—ensuring performance, security, and accuracy so you can build AI that you and your customers can trust.",

I love how the voices sound less robotic and how efficiently the voice overs can be edited and generated.\n\nParrot Ai is the most fun ive had in a long time. The voices are the most realistic Ive ever heard. Mind blown! Pro is absolutely worth it 🚀\n\nI absolutely love how the voice over recognizes punctuation and enunciates with such clarity.\n\nGreat voice over software overall. It offers lots of customization for emphasis and making it sound more natural. It’s sounding less robotic and more human to me.\n\nThis is the best service I’ve used so far! Absolutely stunning.\n\nThis is so perfect. This is exactly what I was looking for. It contains all the features. Thank you so much. Truly appreciate it.",
      "# [Pinecone integrates AI inferencing with vector database](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42315364)\nThis title was a little misleading to me IMO because (maybe my skill issue) I associated \"inferencing\" with \"generation\".\n\nAfter reading the article, it seems Pinecone just now supports in-DB vectorization, a feature that is shared by:\n\n- DataStax Astra DB: https://www.datastax.com/blog/simplifying-vector-embedding-g... (since May 2024)\n\n- Weaviate: https://weaviate.io/blog/introducing-weaviate-embeddings (as of yesterday)\n\nAstra DB seems to just be a tutorial showing how to generate embeddings using another service.\n\nWeaviate seems to have added a similar capability — kind of wild that they announced on the same day.\n\nLooks like Pinecone also includes reranking as part of the same process — did Weaviate add that as well?\n\nNo doubt, it's technically great that Pinecone trained their own embeddings model—but from a business/customer standpoint I can't help but ask _why?_. This is one of those \"build it or buy it\" cases where teams must decide to either integrate with an existing solution or build their own. I'm not sure I see the advantage (from an end user perspective) of using Pinecone's home-rolled embeddings model other than, say OpenAI's, especially given the cost factor: OpenAI embeddings costs really not much.\n\n> Astra DB seems to just be a tutorial showing how to generate embeddings using another service.\n\nThe link I shared showed how a single request to Astra DB's data API has Astra DB automatically create embeddings behind the scenes, integrating with an embedding service the user chooses when they set their database up. Indeed embeddings are generated by another service and not in-house, but from an end-user perspective, they don't need to generate embeddings themeselves as was the prior art and coordinate requests between:\n\n- get text - generate embeddings - take embeddings and send to DB\n\nAs of May when they announced Vectorize, one request did all that. I believe from an end-user experience, this is really analogous to what Weaviate and Pinecone are offering unless I'm missing something.\n\nCan someone please explain how this works?\n\nI assumed that a specific flavour of LLM was needed, an “embedding model” to generate the vectors. Is this announcement that pinecone is adding their own?\n\nIs it better or worse than the models here: https://ollama.com/search?c=embedding For example?\n\nNormally you take your content and run it through an embedding model, inserting the resulting vectors into the vector DB. On a query, for instance, you run the query through the embedding model and query the vector database for the most similar hits to the resulting embedding vector. Similarly reranking is when get get the broad hits from the embedding similarity search and/or BM25, and then a reranker uses the looked up source material to rank the results more finely.\n\nThis is building it into the vector DB such that you send it the content and it is \"built in\".\n\nSeems silly. It's like bundling a stove with cookware. But cookware fit specific niches and have different life cycles. I get that it might cater to some \"drop in solution\" targets, but seems of no value for most engineered, long-term solutions.\n\nThere's more technical detail here: https://www.pinecone.io/blog/integrated-inference/\n\n> Is this announcement that pinecone is adding their own?\n\nTLDR: they trained their own embeddings model and rely on Cohere for ranking. Pinecone (the database) uses this model automatically to generate and store embeddings.\n\n> I assumed that a specific flavour of LLM was needed, an “embedding model” to generate the vectors.\n\nYou're mostly right, with one caveat: embeddings models aren't really LLMs in that they're not very large: they just map semantic meaning to numerical space.\n\n> Is it better or worse than the models here: https://ollama.com/search?c=embedding For example?\n\nThis is the golden question. As far as I know, there is no appropriate benchmarking/eval data about this. I think the real value is the first-class integration between their model and their service.",

      "# [Secure External Access to Unity Catalog Assets via Open APIs on 2024-12-20](https://www.databricks.com/blog/secure-external-access-unity-catalog-assets-open-apis)\nWe're excited to announce the Public Preview of credential vending for Unity Catalog’s open APIs, allowing external clients to securely access Unity Catalog external and managed tables via open source Unity REST APIs, and UniForm-enabled tables through the Iceberg REST catalog APIs. This feature facilitates seamless interoperability across a wide range of engines and tools such as Apache Spark™, DuckDB, Daft, PuppyGraph, StarRocks, Spice AI, Microsoft Fabric, Salesforce Data Cloud, and Iceberg REST catalog engines like Trino and Dremio.\n\nAs the industry’s only unified and open governance solution for data and AI assets, Unity Catalog continues to evolve with a focus on interoperability across the modern data and AI stack. This open approach empowers organizations to adopt best-in-class solutions for their data and AI use cases while avoiding vendor lock-in. Credential vending for open APIs is a key part of our comprehensive open source roadmap, following the announcement of the open-sourcing Unity Catalog at the 2024 Data and AI Summit. Credential vending is also available in the open source Unity Catalog 0.2 release.\n\nUnified governance across any engine with credential vending\n\nGovernance challenges without credential vending\n\nQuery execution in cloud environments depended on static, broad access policies for both metadata and data retrieval, making it difficult to scale. Query engines, like Apache Spark™, are given broad access to the metadata catalog and rely on cloud storage access policies to fetch data from cloud storage. For example, when a user runs a query, the engine needs to access metadata from the catalog and the actual data from the cloud storage like AWS S3, Azure ADLS and GCS. Administrators typically grant the engine full access to the metadata catalog (such as Hive metastore) and create Instance Profiles/Managed Service Identities to define which cloud storage locations the engine can access based on the user's permissions. These instance profiles map user-level access to specific data storage policies.\n\nWhile this model works for small environments with few users and datasets, it breaks down when scaling to large organizations with thousands of users, different tools/compute engines, and hundreds of thousands of data objects. Administrators need to ensure that catalog and storage permissions are in sync, which can be challenging as the number of users and data assets grows. This static approach becomes increasingly complex, error-prone, and difficult to sustain, leading to inefficiencies, security risks, and governance challenges at scale.\n\nScalable governance with credential vending\n\nCredential vending allows a catalog to grant temporary access to storage for an engine performing data processing. This is done through time-limited, downscoped storage credentials generated on demand. These credentials are restricted to the specific storage needed for a higher-level object, like a table. The catalog manages both metadata and governance, meaning it has permanent access to all data, while the engine only gets just-in-time access. For example, if an engine needs to access a specific table stored at a path on AWS S3, the catalog generates a credential limited to that path and provides it to the engine, allowing access. Credential vending leverages the downscoping mechanisms offered by cloud providers like AWS session tokens or Azure delegation SAS credentials.\n\nKey benefits:\n\nCentralized access control: Allows for centralized management of data access permissions through the catalog, rather than having to configure access controls separately for each underlying data source.\n\nTemporary, scoped access: Provides temporary, scoped-down credentials to access data, enhancing security by limiting the lifetime and permissions of access tokens.\n\nSimplified permissions management: Admins don't need to update individual storage bucket policies or IAM roles - permissions can be managed centrally through the catalog.\n\nFoundation for advanced governance features: This provides the foundational building blocks for implementing higher-level access policies. These could include basic access controls or more advanced policies like RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) or ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) that are dynamic in nature.\n\nImplement policies once in Unity Catalog, and enforce them everywhere\n\nHow credential vending enables secure access for external clients\n\nUnity Catalog provides open source REST APIs, allowing external clients to securely access objects such as tables. Admins can define access policies for these objects in Unity Catalog, with Unity Catalog retaining permanent storage access. When an external engine, like Apache Spark™, requests access to a table through the REST APIs using UC credentials like PAT or OAuth tokens, Unity Catalog issues temporary credentials and URLs to control storage access based on the user's specific IAM roles or managed identities, enabling data retrieval and query execution. This simplifies administration, enhances interoperability across engines and tools, and lays the foundation for advanced governance features like RBAC and ABAC to scale access management.\n\nThis capability also extends to Iceberg tables managed in Unity Catalog through Iceberg REST Catalog interface, leveraging the same temporary credential vending process to read Iceberg tables. By enhancing accessibility for a wide range of external engines integrated through Unity REST APIs—such as Apache Spark™, DuckDB, Daft, PuppyGraph, StarRocks, Spice AI, Microsoft Fabric, Salesforce Data Cloud, and Iceberg REST catalog engines like Trino and Dremio—organizations can leverage the tools of their choice while maintaining consistent discovery and governance experiences across platforms. We also plan to extend credential vending support to other Unity Catalog assets, including volumes (unstructured data, arbitrary files). Stay tuned!\n\nSee it in action with Apache Spark™ and Unity Catalog\n\nUnity Catalog Open APIs allow external clients, like Apache Spark™, to interact with the catalog with unified governance. You can fulfill operations like creating, reading, and writing to your Delta tables through vending temporary credentials. You no longer need to confirm and manage IAM permissions for your workloads and keep them in sync across different systems.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to set up your Spark Session to connect to Unity Catalog on Databricks for accessing tables stored in AWS S3.\n\nAccess to read tables is governed by Catalog/Schema/Table privileges. Users require USE CATALOG, USE SCHEMA, EXTERNAL USE SCHEMA, SELECT privileges to read a table.\n\nTo create a table users require CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE on the external storage location, as well as the catalog privileges USE CATALOG, USE SCHEMA and EXTERNAL USE SCHEMA.\n\nSimilarly, you query your UniForm Iceberg tables from the Unity Catalog through the Iceberg REST API. This allows you to access these tables from any client that supports Iceberg REST without introducing new dependencies!\n\nNext steps\n\nThis is just the start of our ongoing roadmap to deliver open access and unified governance for any data or AI asset, in any format, across any workload, and compatible with any compute engine or tool. Credential vending is a powerful building block for governance, and look out for further updates to support secure external access to volumes (Unstructured data, arbitrary files).\n\nTo learn more about credential vending in Unity Catalog and requirements, refer to the documentation for AWS, Azure,GCP.\n\nTo get started with the Unity Catalog, explore the setup guides available for AWS, Azure, and GCP.\n\nYou can also read about the open source 0.2 release of Unity Catalog for more details",

      "# [Tracking the gender diversity in our investment pipeline](https://blackbird.vc/blog/tracking-gender-diversity-in-our-investment-pipeline-24)\nThis blog has been co-authored by multiple people at Blackbird including: Alissa Lucas, Kate Glazebrook, Alexandra Gifford, Nick Crocker, Melia Rayner and Rick Baker.\n\n‍However we would like to give particular credit to Alissa Lucas, Impact Associate at Blackbird, who has led the work to gather the metrics from our portfolio, but has also gone much further in analysing these metrics to gather useful insights which we’ll take forward on our work in this area.\n\n‍\n\nHow we're tracking\n\nIn May 2023, we made public our commitment to improving the gender diversity of the founders we invest in, and set a benchmark goal of seeing 40% of companies at IC (investment committee) pitch with at least one woman founder. At that time, we also published our data on investing in more women founders, and we did so again in December. We were, and still are, guided by the belief that no matter how good or bad our data is, we’re committed to sharing it and will continue to do so annually.\n\nWhen we first committed to releasing the data, there wasn't an industry standard, so we set one we thought was right for us. Equity Clear has since emerged and, as supporters, we're adjusting to meet their guidelines. Per the Equity Clear templates, we’ll be reporting on the gender diversity in both our investment team and our investment pipeline. To ensure consistency going forward, we’ll also be moving to reporting on a financial year basis. Our results are set out below, but the summary is that:\n\nover the past 12 months:\n\nwe invested in 16 new companies and only 5 of these had a woman in the founding team (31%); but\n\nby dollar amount, we did better, investing 35% into founding teams with women.\n\n44% of our investment team and 38% of those who make direct investment decisions are women.\n\nWhile this is broadly in line with industry averages, we don’t think these numbers are good enough and it’s not where we want to be. We’re frustrated that the efforts we’ve made over the last 12 months haven’t moved the needle as much as we hoped (or, in some cases, at all).\n\nBelow we share more on the data and how we’re approaching the challenge.\n\n‍\n\nThe data today: Gender diversity in our investment team\n\nOverall, the Blackbird team is now 57% women, and our Executive Team (the group that leads Blackbird) is also 57% women. While this number is important, also important is the diversity within our Investment Team, which is set out below in the Equity Clear format.\n\nNote: the Equity Clear template also covers ‘other gender or identity’ and ‘racially and ethnically diverse including Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander peoples’. While we conduct diversity surveys internally, they are optional and we don’t have 100% completion so we cannot answer these metrics with certainty.\n\n‍\n\nWe’re close to target on our overall Investment Team diversity, but we’re below target at the senior investor level. Of course, this is also skewed by the fact that our two founding partners are male.\n\nWe’re working toward improving the gender parity in our senior investment team over time as our junior team grows into more senior roles and we continue to hire a diversity of team members. We’ll also continue to use Applied, an anonymised de-biased recruitment platform that has already been integral to improving team diversity.\n\n‍\n\nThe data today: Gender diversity in our investments\n\nBelow is our investment pipeline data in the Equity Clear format. The data includes all investments made over the period July 2023 to June 2024 from the two current Australian and New Zealand Blackbird Core Funds, our funds dedicated to new investments in early-stage companies.\n\n‍\n\nNote: due to small sample sizes, we have not included non-binary founders.\n\n‍\n\nThe following chart shows how this compares to last financial year. As you can see, we did slightly worse on the number of investments, but better by dollars invested.\n\n‍\n\nIt’s worth noting that we only invested in 16 new companies from these funds in FY24, so even one company can make a big difference to the percentages.\n\nThat said, it’s clear that we have fallen short of our internal goal of seeing 40% of companies at IC pitch with at least one woman founder, seeing only 33% in FY24.\n\nWe own our numbers: regardless of the progress we have made on certain metrics, we know that we still have a long way to go.\n\n‍\n\nActions we've taken\n\nWe have an investment strategy and process which has been formed over the last 12 years of Blackbird’s existence and from our teams’ experiences before founding Blackbird. We have always focused on finding and investing in the best companies we can, regardless of the founders’ gender or background. This has served us well and created a strong track record of financial returns.\n\nOur most successful investment is co-founded and led by a woman and we have a number of highly successful women-led and co-founded companies in our portfolio.\n\nBut a few years ago, we realised our process wasn’t working to get the gender diversity that we wanted across our whole portfolio and we started working towards improving. (It’s also important to note here that gender is just one form of diversity we care about. If we can find ways to meaningfully tackle the gender issue, the learnings, solutions and structural debiasing that come from it can hopefully inform how we can best solve other diversity issues.)\n\nSo far, we’ve tried to approach it from a few angles:\n\nWe started by:\n\ntrying to remove bias in our investment process by requiring blind voting in both pitches and hiring,\n\ndoing allyship training, and\n\nensuring that everyone in our team (men/women, junior/senior) could effectively express their views.\n\nWe set gender diversity targets within our pipeline and started measuring and reporting on them on a monthly basis internally and an annual basis externally.\n\nThen we focused on our deal flow, trying to reach more women founders. We intentionally directed our programs and partnerships (like Giants, Foundry, Protostars and the programs run by others that we support) to focus on bringing more gender diverse founders into startups.\n\nAnd of course all along, we’ve been working to have greater diversity in our senior investment team.\n\nDespite all of this, we’re still not seeing the end results at the new investment level. Partly this is because some initiatives take time to bear fruit. And partly it’s because as an industry, we’re still seeing too few women entrepreneurs. We recognise that the systemic challenges might take years to overcome, and progress may be non-linear.\n\n‍\n\nWhat comes next\n\nThis is a stubborn problem plaguing the whole industry and we don’t have the solution yet. But we can continue to strive to get better. For us, that looks like:\n\nKeeping our target of seeing 40% of teams with women founders at the Investment Committee (IC) pitch stage. We think this is helping us stay focused and accountable.\n\nDelving deeper into what our programs can do to surface great women founders and support those early in their startup journeys to believe this could be a path for them. We’ll keep the gender targets for Giants and Foundry which have worked well so far.\n\nIn the last year, adding Giants companies to our deal flow pipeline resulted in a 40% increase in all-women founded teams at that stage. We’ve also seen that two out of the five Foundry companies that have applied for investment and made it through to IC pitch had at least one woman founder in their team. This is especially notable given Foundry focuses on deep tech and biotech, fields typically associated with a greater degree of gender imbalance.\n\nHowever, the big impact of these programs is still yet to be felt as we typically see a lag time to investment from our programs, with most of the cheques being made 1-2 years after a company’s involvement in a program.\n\nContinuing to interrogate our data, including deal sourcing. We know from the last 12 years of investing that phenomenal founders can come from anywhere. So we want to make sure that each of our principal channels for meeting founders (including website applications, referrals, direct outreach, and events) is helping toward our goal.\n\nFinally, working with others. We’re under no illusion that we can solve this on our own and we’re excited to see more industry collaboration through groups like Equity Clear. We’re eager to work with our peers on these thorny challenges the industry faces, while continuing to do everything we can internally to move the needle.\n\nMost of all, we will continue sharing our data publicly. As Kate and Nick wrote in our first release of this data, we believe that transparency drives better outcomes, even if (especially if) it is uncomfortable. We’ll continue to publicly track and disclose our progress and you can hold us to account.\n\n‍\n\nThank you for reading. Feedback is always welcome, and if you have a startup idea you’re looking to pitch, we would love to hear from you.\n\n‍",
